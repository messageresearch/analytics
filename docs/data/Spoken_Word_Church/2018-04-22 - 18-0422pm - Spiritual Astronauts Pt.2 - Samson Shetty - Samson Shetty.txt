Canada while I was sitting in the pastor's office he brought brought me some you know quartz I really the message this morning was really a timely timely message I believe so we are the spiritual astronauts sitting in the heavenly places in Christ to Jesus and here this morning I was mentioning about that horse horsepower we were discussing we were talking about that horses and you know automobile or horse and buggy or airplane and whatever they regard the missionary you know the ancients they call the horsepower so and here I got another coat really was a blessing to me you know and and I would like to share this is in 1964 brother Branham question-and-answers Jefferson will he said like this you know he was talking about Rebekah and you know so look the very camel she watered was the camel that packed her to her bridegroom and all of our success and the very camel to the very power of the beast in the Bible represents power and the very power that we give water and praise to a man see water life praise to the world is the very thing that pacts us into the glory land to meet the bridegroom yes sir praise the Lord and really and also the you know I was so you know and I was speaking about the Prophet's reward when you went up to that to see the circus I brother Wade gave me that word really and thank you brother you know sometimes we people come from different world we have in different country you know other side of the globe Eastern countries and we have our accents we have our English we have our own cab you know pronounce eh it's all things you know so when brother Branham went up to that place and he said and you all know that story and he is to tell his friends and we are his friends and God took him up to the 6th dimension it's not a circus it's a supernatural really it's a supernatural dimension amen and and and he went there and he had seen all the glorious things and uh and our loved ones and the saints of God in all those ages and then he came back and he told us amen and I was talking about the prophets reward and I got this wonderful you know quotations from brother Joe and 1964 by the Brando question and answers in jeffersonville he said brother Brandon you know I think sister Hazel Canada I think sister Hazel Canada asked this question brother Branham if you have time please explain Matthew 1041 I would like to know what is a Prophet's reward and I was when I was young when I came to the message for the and in the in the beginning you know I was thinking about what was the Prophet's reward and after we came into the messy we are reading and learning and studying you know so then we know that Prophet's reward is to befriend with a prophet we all are the friends of the prophet of God amen praise the name of the Lord and then we you know while you I was talking to brother Aaron this afternoon he said you know we heard about the radio and we used to hear all the voices and you know the sound and then when the television came up they when they invented the television now the voice became as a picture like brother Brian how he said he preached the message called I have heard but now I see see we heard from the radios and now we can see you know so it's all time a natural technology everything it's a type to the supernatural amen praise the Lord and also I thank the brother and sister here they took me from the park to the pastor's office thank you brother thank you sister god bless you and if you have your Bible splitter let's stand and lift to the word this evening thank you I think I've got some time tonight I would like to show some pictures too so I don't want to go there to haul over the world because you know some you know I told Pasteur and some of the brothers here so anyhow let's go to the same scriptures what we have read this morning Hebrews chapter 11 and verse 1 2 3 now faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen for by it the elders obtained a good report through faith we understand that the words were worlds were framed by the Word of God so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear may the Lord and His blessings of reading of his word let's bow our horse let's pray most precious Heavenly Father we thank you Lord for this wonderful time that you have given to come into the house of God and to fellowship with your people around the world and bless our time bless our service bless the word and speak to our hearts through the Holy Spirit once again I pray Lord that you bless this church bless the pastor

thank you Lord in Jesus Christ's matchless and wonderful name we pray and the Bride of Christ says amen amen you may be seated Saints thank you this evening time I just wanted to continue on the same thought this morning it's like an evangelistic message of course and also it is like encouraging each other encouraging in in the in the world yeah praise the Lord hallelujah and and I just wanted to title the same spiritual astronauts amen astronaut or cosmonaut we all know that you just spoke this morning it means a person who trained to travel in a spacecraft a spaceman or pay space woman or space traveler you know a person who travels to beyond the earth Earth's atmosphere and traveler in a spacecraft amen so the spiritual astronauts if the natural Arsenal astronauts if like that what about the spiritual arts Ranaut's they will they will come out from this world like brother branham said they came out from Egypt Alleluia that is the first Exodus and the jesus time second and now the third amen so we are coming out from the denominationalism and you know different isms we have different isms in this world in often denominationalism x' and Hinduism's and and and in different kinds of religion isms and you know and all kinds of isms we are coming out from that and we are entering in into the Promised Land amen praise the Lord so my brothers and sisters here this morning we have talked about we are we have spoke we you know we heard about you know the spiritual arts and arts and their power you know power for the spiritual or spiritual astronauts they got the power from on high amen praise the Lord and Jesus said I am from above ye are of this world but I'm not of this world jesus said amen praise the Lord hallelujah and Enoch was the first astronaut he walked with God and Elijah and Jesus Christ he's like brother branham's and he's a master astronaut amen praise the Lord hallelujah he died he gave his life and he took the life back amen and he is God that Authority our power our right and he said my father gave it to me amen my brothers and sisters spiritual astronauts jesus said in front of that spiritual author our church even the death even the Hell will not prevail against to it amen because we are more than overcomers we have right we have power we have the Holy Ghost and in other words the brother branham said she has the Satan or which means the word is naívi and the word is in your mouth and the word is in your heart the Word of Faith which we preach amen praise the Lord that means if we speak to you know to a problem or to a disease to a situation or any Cara uh uh uh you know obstacle or circumstances that will will fade away it will be gone because we have that authority we have the power the spiritual astronauts they leave my faith amen and amen praise the Lord and and I would like to read here a brother branham some of the courts here and what he said in the in the same message in 1962 countdown in 1962 and 58 paragraph he said he was talking about airplane and then he came to this you know after the Pentecostal age he was talking about now he said now the Pentecostal age for the last 50 years has sent a revival around the world with all kinds of everything in it they have had healings and sickness been healed crippled healed blind had their sight restored to them do you think the world believed it say no sir they didn't believe see Luther didn't believe Luther they didn't believe Wesley they didn't believe the Pentecostals but God took the Bible a man this is the authority this is the power the Word of God the worlds were framed by the Word of God by a spoken word amen in his research but God took the Bible in his research a man who was willing to do it took the Bible and proved to it that it was right amen now we got to remember that we got to believe it seeing those things were at time now we have lived up to Pentecostal age see one after one step by step just God is calling his bride from the ages one after one justification after sanctification sanctification after Baptists or the Holy Ghost baptism of the Holy Ghost after into that top astronaut age Amen praise the Lord he said now we lived up to Pentecostal age the Pentecostal age as I have proved over here goes out into the lower edition age praise the Lord but now something else happened hallelujah now something else happened what is that that is more than healing of crippled huh see the word manifesting in the broad body conquering the death conquering the world praise God hallelujah it is not me speaking but you speak jesus said when you speak it will come into existence you don't see that revelation in the Pentecostal age but God said speak to that that the tree or me I mean speak to the dead fish it will come into life and he spoke to that fish and he came into life see that word manifesting in the body of the believers the spiritual astronauts got the self power self Authority hallelujah hey man you speak to this mountain you speak to this problem you speak to these circumstances my brother sister I can tell you hundreds of testimonies even our believers they when they speak to the circumstances even some of the message churches in the boonies whatever you call the rural remote villages in the boonies out there the beautiful hallelujah I tell you and people there don't know nothing they don't have an education they don't have proper shelters they don't have proper food they don't have nothing in there and one dead man was he was a man was dead and they took him under the tree and they were crying and praying to God for three days fasting and praying and he almost died almost died he's dead when they pour water on his mouth the water going like this when they poured the milk the milk you know he's not swallow he's swallowing the milk nothing and he's totally dead flies and bugs and coming in and you know as you see all flying on his face and you know and even though they're believers are praying and praying and asking the Lord to to do a miracle and God did a miracle after three days he heroes get man rised yeah amen that is the power hallelujah the power of the word of God is in the believer this evening amen praise the Lord hallelujah but now something else happened we got an astronaut now John Glenn was our first astronaut and we find out that that's so far about the airplane hairpin airplane can only go as far as it is pressure and so forth but this is by an atomic etat atomic atomic power a great test to power a greater power that presses him so much higher not lower higher God wants us to go up amen hallelujah higher than an airplane an airplane even isn't isn't in it that's right he's been able to do that alright now we've got an astronaut natural eh to the spiritual age praise the Lord and we are just tapping into that that that will leave me yes just as the technology as the science developing as the same way in a you know in a spiritual dream in the spiritual side to in a spiritual life we are developing in a in a world lines in a spiritual lines praise the name of the Lord and remember the messenger comes at the end of the former message amen always we have proved that there now we are on the ocelot line praise the Lord amen amen sense has been be able to prove that there's an astronaut that can go so far till you couldn't see it with your natural eyes we can see when the airplane goes we can see it we can see the helicopter we can see all these things in the natural things but when the astronaut when he when he go up you don't see you can't see with your natural eye he's very you know he's a space traveler praise the Lord hallelujah a man couldn't see it with your natural eyes and it can go whether there is any pressure there or not praise the Lord hallelujah an astronaut oh my what an age that that is coming he was still incoming but it's already here now hallelujah I think the first astronaut one who stepped in on the moon is a Neil Neil Armstrong right yeah some brother took me you know higher to that Neil Armstrong what you call that you know planetarium a museum or something yeah then when they took me they showed me all this and when I'm looking at all this they're how they were there you know the dress or whatever you call the clothing or you know the the uniform or whatever the helmet and all these you know so I was when I'm looking at all these things I have heard from the message and now I see I have heard from the message and the Lord brought me here from Haulover from India to show this and I'm seeing all these and they took me into that you know that term a little theater and they got that film and I saw and what I heard still I remember it says like I in the in the film you know the Neil Armstrong he was the first astronaut he stepped his first leg left leg I heard left leg he stepped on the moon he was the first astronaut and then these people are trying to find something up there praise the Lord hallelujah glory what that what does it represent a spiritual age a spiritual time to where God is going to have spiritual Austra noughts wonder while you know this science achievements are going on at the same time God is bringing his church typing you know how God's prophet is typing with the natural and the spiritual really really so beautiful praise the name of the

they get what they go up into that you know the space stations are into the space you know he's saying he was telling here and remember I don't know I have never read this before I've never I've never learned this all these lessons or all this information in the school but in the spiritual astronaut school and learning this amen hallelujah in the spiritual astronaut school we are learning there is the body of Jesus Christ and the message of the hour is giving us that rapturing faith that we can fly hallelujah ha I like the Sun I fly away amen and remember in order to be an astronaut they had to get in a tank coma and their kin they can't control themselves it takes a Raider Raider power I'm smelling radar radar power and atomic power to lift him out beyond space and then it is control is controlled by at our glory God's spiritual astronauts is the same they come into a tank into a place into a body and that body is the body of Christ then it's not them hallelujah so we are coming into the body and becoming astronauts hallelujah praise the Lord and here and I want to you know I'm just reading some course I hope you read this and I hope you you you you listened you heard this message but but we you know sometimes so when when Holy Spirit speaks through some different ministers or some different times you know it's it will be a blessing amen amen hallelujah God words men sue men who can come into Christ and believe that he is the same yesterday today and forever and don't take their own thinking move out into space hallelujah controlled by the Holy Ghost amen astronauts how far it is back to the horse and buggy how far it is even from the airplane how far it is from justification sanctification Baptists or the Holy Ghost they are coming to Eagles the first ever lizards OMA when I read these lasers there were lizards and there become chickens haha then they become Crouse but now there are Eagles when I was in the world I was like a lizard when I came into the nominal Christian family like her and I born into the Christian family law law or like when I went to the Baptist Church I was like a chicken home ah and then God he he has choosen me not me choosing him but he choosen me hallelujah from crows and now they are Eagles no one can follow them and eagle is a special bird we are Eagles and we are ready to fly in this evening time we are trying to go into that heaven Lisa praise the name of the Lord astronauts for Jesus God's atom power that pushes you plumb out in space out yonder hey man halt why what is it in these astronauts he is God in the whole Bible amen he's got into all of it because he knows what God is able to perform every promise he have her made he just sits there and waits oh my sitting in the heavenly places in Christ - Jesus is bringing up into that levels my momma praise the name of the Lord thank you Jesus thank you Lord the astronaut is controlled by a radar power and we got radars - he said and remember the astronaut is controlled by a radar power power you see in damn brain John Lennon and he said and we got a radar - it's a prayer if we don't have a prayer what made John to get get up into the higher the level later when he was in a Patmos Isle he was not scared about the lasers or scorpions or snakes or nothing he was he said I was into the spirit I went into the spirit and I was so you know he was just he took you know his spirit went into the another dimension and what made him prayer prayer he was praying and crying and and and asking the Lord to to give him a revelation praise Lord that's the revelation amen and amen we got a radar - it's prayer prayer is the radar power that directs the astronaut every Christian ocelot every spiritual astronaut have to have the prayer life program said we eat much we talk much we walk much we do all things much but we don't pray why because you know I was thinking about that last night it was getting too late like a one o'clock and I was praying and I was asking the Lord to help me and to give me a torch and to read and to study and you know because you know sometimes we get we get to the bread like we go to sleep when I wake up from that country's like two o'clock in the morning you know because there's a time difference you know so now there is night time we feel like sleepy now but I am not feeling sleepy I'm rejoicing in my heart joy sing in my spirit in my soul hallelujah praise the Lord and he said the prayer is a raid our power that directs the Austral Lord ask father anything in my name I will do it see just watch the way the prayers going you can see the way is pointing Amen just watch the where the church is praying you can see the where the missiles will fly glory hallelujah you can tell it by the way the astronauts are traveling by the way the church is praying prayer food church praying whatever you are doing in your business in your family in your church in your ministry while you are going outside while you are coming inside while you're eating your food people may think the unbelievers may think that you got some kind of crazy you know you know doings you know but you know what you are a spiritual astronaut because that puts you up into the heavenlies that pulls you that push you that brings you out from the worldly circumstances a problems of stress a strain I have seen in my life while the people are discussing and fussing and arguing and then some families are first single arguing I was as a man minister as a as a pastor you know as a man of God I told them to stop stop but sometimes they don't hear you sometimes even though believers Christiane's they don't hear you but you know what when you stay and say let's pray everyone respects God you know after we pray a word of Prayer that things will change and you don't see after amen you don't see any fussing arguing discussing shouting screaming nothing because as the prophet of God said your prayer changes things and then I believe that with all my heart I have seen miracles after miracles in my life hallelujah glory it will text you and brings you out from the situation where you are going through the problem or mental tress or emotional problems or our family problems or whatever no the problem when you when you go into your knees and when you ask God for the leadership of the Holy Ghost sometimes you don't know what to do whether I go to left or right or what to do whether I go to America or not and well while you are getting the invitation now people are asking brother Shetty are you coming are you coming this year are you coming this way oh you know that makes me to come feel like I feel like a pool you know but I don't know what to do at the same time my family and I same time a church at the same time as a circumstances it looks like I want to be there I have to be there but you know what sometimes God is pulling you're somewhere you know but when you go on your knees and sincerely when you ask God Lord I need your leadership I need you what to do what to do how to do when to do and and Lord lead me and guide me whenever you pray a sincere prayer like that and the Holy Spirit is the inside teacher he will he will guide you what to do and when to do and how to do you know he is the inside teacher my brother sister of course you may have that experience I am sharing my experience a lot of you know in my ministry I have seen the greatest things I have just you know after prayer a word of Prayer even the people those who came to beat us they change in their lives yeah I've seen that in those Muslims yeah we were fighting you know I mean we and we've not been fighting but the people are trying to fight with us but you know what the prayer our church fasting and praying when the persecution is growing stronger and stronger and stronger day by day the church is getting closer to God sometimes God will bring you into the fiery furnace yesterday I was telling brother Larry Scoggins or some other brothers I was telling them you know sometimes it's good to you you know to come into that kind of situations you know but you don't look like good you know it won't look so oh very good I'm feeling very happy no no no sometimes it will take you into that kind of situations to bring you back to God into the presence of God that makes you involves you and shapes you into that divine image

the Lord hallelujah hallelujah never compromising never compromising for anything if their people come and we have to have why I so told you that means we have to have it there you got to have it err courage you have to have that courage if not so you know God didn't give us a spirit of fear no we have the Holy Spirit we are a doctor sons and daughters of God and God he he bought us purchases by shedding his own blood and he brought us amen so never compromised if they are trying to kill you yeah you know my god is real I don't want to worship that I don't see you know I can't break a coconut even the people in beside of our church you know they're trying to do some some kind of one time they throw the lemon and then and they put a little eggs and coconuts and all kinds of once in a full moon once in a half moon they put all these things and they came into our church and they put like there somewhere which doctors in Eastern countries you see this kind of you know in Africa in different countries you see these kind of things but my brothers and sisters when the spiritual Austral arts look at that they will dress it be the name of the Lord we are sons and daughters of God this is this world is not our home we are so we are just traveling in this world and our home is heaven and we are spiritual astronauts growing into that spiritual heavenly hallelujah praise the name of the Lord thank you Jesus thank you Lord my brothers and sisters I like this hi how brother branham said any man or woman who will dare at any time any time to take God as his word it's an astronaut having courage having dare if anybody comes and tell you just leave that Bible we are going to we are going to burn burn these Bibles no I want to stay with this word come out from this message don't believe there will be a brand of cult Samson come out we will send you for the bachelor of Divinity Doctor of Divinity having our nice mentioned these are that and the only pleasure and every offers but you know a fleshly man natural man pulls you something you know because when you are standing up the word is always on ha God is always on top then you are standing with the word you're like on top and the world is like there and I told you this morning it always pulls you down it's very easy to get down it's very easy to go down it's very easy to fill down but it is hard to go up but it is beyond our power that Holy Spirit which comes from above gives us power to go up heaven hallelujah thank you Lord Jesus without compromising compromising no compromise I like brother brand of how you said no compromise scam in the world stay with the message hey man and a man I seen the little coolest thing and Allah he said something you know about the Indians talking about you know the American Indians they're talking about the white man is going to up to the moon and we are going to have our country he was talking over Dan and everybody here oh I was I was reading this and I said what oh oh my so they want to have their natural you know country or the land but spiritual astronauts they're looking up a man and a man praise the name of the Lord the scripture says if II then be risen with Christ seek those things which are above where Christ sitteth on the right hand of God set your affection on things above not on things on the earth astronaut coming out from heavenly atmosphere and traveling into the space amen for ye are dead and your life is hid with Christ in God when Christ who is our life that the message Christ is the anointed word of this hour man who is our life the messages of my life the message is our life shall appear then shall he also appear with him in glory when he comes we come with him because he is going to come he's going to in his secret coming in the rapture is taking us away from this world and when is coming on his third third time he will be bringing us with him amen and we will be with him forever praise the Lord hallelujah glory to God my precious brothers and sisters this evening time I'm really I'm so glad to enjoy the word amen and here we we have read many scriptures here and also the courts here this morning and also this evening so my brothers and sisters hear what he said but at the same time the true the real true believer in Christ has entered this astronaut amen by one spirit we all baptized into one astronaut oh one body it can stand any kind of pressure spiritual scientists Houma so the real spiritual believer has a campaigned himself and got into God's ocean art Christ believing all things what God said amen we believe that now notice the real believer is in Christ no condemnation to them that is in Christ preached the word you don't see in the world they are preaching the world I like what how brother branham said you know when we do mission work or foreign mission with the Word of God we are always in the will of God amen with the Word of God people are going and doing mission work but always the word first word of God the message of the hour is the first amen as a bride of Jesus Christ will know that praise the Lord hallelujah and he says tear with the word I don't care what the denomination say I don't care what my uncle said I don't care what my cousin's my brother-in-law said no sir but you know what my brother my cousin also a Yahoo offered me easy he's like a Pentecostal either he's a Pentecostal man and there are big people you know like when you talk about them oh you know that man oh oh we are you related to him oh you know but you know but to me if there if there is no word what what is greater than word what is greater than the message of the hour I have never seen anything this world so that's why Peter and the disciples said Jesus said do you want to live to whom shall we go where we go I don't know why these people are getting crazy you know a brother from I I used to I mean I met him in some youth camp when I came to America first time and this brother is no more in the message and they're used to in that they're used to you know go to church a message church and and they love the Lord they love the message they follow the message and his wife grown a long hair and long skirts and everything but now pants makeup head you know haircut what happened and all of a sudden they sent me a message text message saying you know brother branham did this beard and a daughter and when I check that believe the sign when I saw that the Holy Spirit said just tell them believe the sign so I read believe the sign ok dot-com I wrote them brother the website says like this believe the side so just believe the sign that's it no more questioning and no more answering just believing just believing I don't want to you know argue and you don't want to ask me any questions no more questioning no more answering no more discussion just believe the believe the scientists believe the sign that's it still it's got that so I don't know why these people are living there God said some kind of crazy ideas Satan went into their brains and corrupted and polluted their brains with the worldly technology if we take like the brother was telling I think brother Lewis yesterday or brother Joel we are having this discussion talking you know and the tree of knowledge and good and evil and everything is good and evil if you eat food a lot if you eat a certain certain quantity to your body that's good if you eat a lot you may have stomach pain stomachache or headache or you got some diarrhea whatever you know the problem you know or you know your sugar levels go up or BP bread pressures go up or down or whatever you know everything you know you got to have our balance even in the word - we have to have a balance we must maintain the balance you know so these people just losing all things and taking this technology and and then and commenting on the supernatural cloud I don't have any shadow of doubt on that cloud a man we believe the sign that's it a man and a man so here brother Branham said that real true believer in Christ as entered in his astronaut praise the Lord praise the Lord thank you Jesus I don't care what the denomination says they are going to believe it who the true spiritual astronauts they believe the sign they believe the world they believe the Prophet amen amen what made them a divine revelation a new verse rather random said what is the new birth it's a personal revelation to you in the crisis the mystery of God revealed it's a personal you know it's not a baptism of the Holy Ghost in the same message he was telling he was saying that the baptism of the Holy Ghost gives you the power but the new birth is something else see the pentecostal there's talked over there but beyond the Pentecostal age we are coming of course like brother branham said we are going through the same door like Noah they went to the same door one door and we read the scripture in this morning in the revelation there the hope and heaven now ehman was opened with the one door and Jesus said I am the door and he just I am the doors no I am the door one door and it is opened it is open for everyone it is open for you and me it is open so when we when we are going through that that means we are going through a justification first floor and then first floor and second floors sanctification and the baptism of the Holy Ghost then after the new verse the what you see that the pyramid you know capstone Amen we see this ages too and he was talking about the world's number is 10 and that's the world number and God's number is always 7 1 2 3 4 you know official smyrna pergamum thyatira sardis philadelphia Livadia amen Laodicea we have our accents so yeah so you understand right praise the Lord amen they will stand right there because it sees the word the denominational kick up a big verse and excommunicated them run them out and say they are crazy that's what they are telling all my other family you know into my family and other other side you know those who are not in the message they look at me down oh you are there thank God in the word I'm here not compromising with the word just standing is up up in the heavenly places praise Lord they look at me like this oh you are there but you know what I never compromise we never compromised when I met my wife she was in a Pentecostal church but I like this I like this wonderful Christians spirit-filled grown and she was like you know she she was in the message when I met her but I introduced the message to her by giving us a water Babson tract and she read that and she said this is the truth I believe it I searched the scripture and she said this is the truth I'm going to be baptized wonderful praise the Lord and then after I I don't know how to express my you know want to marry her and I gave her a book choosing of a bride this message brought me and my wife together yeah and when I was in Chicago I don't know what to go where to go and what to do and what to where to go and I don't know this brother you know and I want to I want to I just spoke to him on the phone but I don't know him very well you know I don't remember I don't have an idea of his face you know so I told him I'm going to stand with the message with the Eagle picture message I'm standing there so then when you go through in that you know you know that place so you can see our terminal so you can see and so I just standing there identification identified with the world identified with the message my wife identified with the message mice mice children identified with the message my church identified with the message we are an Eagles which is inside it's expressing the outside glory to God thank you Jesus thank you Lord everything like that but this tear right with the word as long as God promised it they stayed there because they are astronauts they believe the word and there's nowhere to get rid rid of them they're going to leave you anyhow so just let them alone a while see that's what we're doing you know so my brothers and sisters so and you know not compromising with any kind of thing when I gave my wife this message she never questioned me she even don't know that I'm going to marry her and she don't know she don't know anything in Eastern countries you know especially in a special especially in some kind of really rich regions like we have mediators we have a official you know thing you know to to get you know Mary you know all these you know like Eliezer like Abraham arranging marriages arranged marriages so we don't see here but you know when I read the prophets message it says like this you've got to choose your wife you got to choose your oh so do I need to go and talk to the mighty mediator who is my mediator now my mediator is Holy Spirit I want to talk to him and I spoke to him and then I just I really liked my wife and when when she was 17 you know and the long hair full covering dress and just walking with her mom mama you know in the in the in the in the church place and I saw and I asked the one of the brothers who is that girl she's very close to the message I feel something you know you know and then he said there are denominations you never know you know but I introduced the message if she don't accepted this message so I would have not married her but she accepted the message she said I have never heard a testimony like this before I gave a supernatural testimony of brother Branham she read that I have never read I have never heard a wonderful testimonies like this before he was in a Pentecostal church and thereafter she came into the message and I baptized my wife then after her three brothers then after her three bro sister-in-laws praise the Lord on our coming into the message my brothers and sisters I tell you they are very strong in their full gospel churches their parents were Trinitarian Pentecostal church people but my brothers and sisters I just believed the word as for me and my household we want to serve the Lord as for me and my household we are an astronaut's as spiritual astronauts we want to go into the heavenly places we want to sit in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus in the world not compromising just staying with the word hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah and my parents when they got their only house and property there there is no more place we used to have

years back and we dedicated and and pastor Larry hair and different brothers scheme and they dedicated our church building and also our sister church building in another remote village praise the Lord why I'm telling these things means how God is working among the spiritual astronauts how God is dealing with the people you can't change a man you can't change a person with what changes the Holy Spirit the word changes the word motivates them praise the Lord hallelujah amen and amen thank you Jesus thank you Lord this great orbiting that the church is getting ready to do and a great time of
