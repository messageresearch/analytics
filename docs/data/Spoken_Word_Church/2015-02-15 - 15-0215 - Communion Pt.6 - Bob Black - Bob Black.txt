========================================

foreign all right so um let's go back to John 19 verse 30. because that's really the scripture I want to focus on and and uh for those that are listening on and recording we just read John chapter 19. we're going to narrow down on that scripture it is finished where Jesus on the cross it probably wouldn't look like the worst time for all the disciples were wondering is this the culmination of Jesus of ministry and and there on the cross he said it is finished that fulfilled that that promise back there in the Garden of Eden when communion was broken between Adam and Eve and God made the promise I'll put enmity okay here we go yeah between the woman's seed and the serpentine okay and and there on that cross he was restoring communion back and he said it's finished the whole the work is complete that stone that came out of the mountain came and struck the image right there because all Satan's kingdom had been set up that that that that started in the Garden of Eden came down through cush and Nimrod all the Babylonian the the uh just continuing on down to uh all the way down to the present age the ten toes but there on the cross it was finished he he struck the image now now there's kind of a dilemma because the stone is The Headstone and the Cornerstone it's the bottom and the top of the pyramid right it strikes that when he they're on Calvary it's it struck the feet of the image and and finished it but yet there's something that has to be done there's something there's a process that has to take place and and that's kind of what I I want to talk about uh so let's let's just pray before we and then read the scripture again before we get into it the Lord Jesus we're just so thankful Lord for the opening of your word and for your grace to us Lord I pray God that you'll be with the service this morning the Lord Brother Wade and be with all the people Lord and help the Lord that this will not seem complicated Lord but that you open it to our hearts to see your great plan and purpose grant that Lord we pray in your name amen because you know this this really a lot of times the things like the seals and and all these things seem so complicated but remember brother and told the people when he was preaching the seals just continue on the same simple message the same simple message of justification sanctification baptism nor a ghost once you received the new birth then God continues anymore justification sanctification of Baptist and all goes and second Peter said being born again because he's bringing us into communion justification sanctification baptism the Holy Ghost and the Capstone that brings us into perfect communion where God has total control of Our Lives and he's demolishing he's tearing down the kingdom of Satan in our lives just as he will tear down the kingdom of Satan in the natural life because remember in the Garden of Eden the Earth was cursed he's got to reclaim back the Earth right he's got to cling back claim again this Earth he's got to take everything back so that everything can be restored back to communion with him right so now now when you look at this pyramid that's you can see the seals because what's the seven seal the end of all things and God looks at it says this my work is finished the the process has been complete the uh and what does this what does the seals reveal the seals reveal Christ Christ in his church Christ the whole the whole plan that when he would uh I'm gonna jump ahead we're gonna look at some quotes in a second but let's just look at this quote first because this is this kind of let's just dwell on this for a second and meditate on this that stone tears down Satan's kingdom and and then the message was one that's 1962 brother and said Satan will make you all kind of promises but he has nothing to give you because he don't have nothing you don't have no salvation what is Satan anything contrary to the word he doesn't have salvation he doesn't have life his kingdom is Darkness the end thereof is death darkness and death is Satan's kingdom program repeat it again this is good this is real important that's what we're talking about Baal and Meredith and Kush and Nimrod and all this stuff the Stone comes down to tear this apart to tear down everything in your life is contrary to God's word brother random repeat again what is Satan's kingdom anything contrary to the word of God now that's cutting but it's time for cutting see to Branch the tree if it's going to Bear must be pruned it's time anything contrary to the precepts of God the word of God is not God what is it what is sin righteousness perverted what is death life perverted what is the kingdom of Satan anything that's setting something to take the place of the word anything any teaching one word just one word you might believe every bit Eve believed every bit of it to that of it to that one word that one word is all she needed to disbelieve that one word is all you need to disbelieve now meditate on this because this is why God had to send a prophet in this day to get us back to where we we believe all of God's work we don't look at God's word and say well I'm not 100 sure about the serpentine right or is that son of man really correct is the all the seals really opened I really need anything addition to what the prophet brought is there is there uh is maybe my church's teaching right the denominational idea but but God brings us back into perfect communion with him by the by the opening word through a prophet that brought us brought us everything that was hidden in the Mountain of God from before the foundation of the world that's that's kind of getting a little bit deep but just hang on and the guys little room said the holy spirit always speaks to the word I got many things to tell you you cannot understand it now but when he comes he'll guide you to it that's the reason the coming of the seals at the finishing of the seventh seal the mystery of God should be finished to know who God Is Right what he is how he lives his nature his being now see there on the cross and Jesus finished it but now for you to take advantage of it you have to accept what he did right and the the recipe is repent can be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and the promise is to you so then when that Stone comes into your heart by the new birth then he begins to tear down the kingdom of Satan in your life that's right and it grows and grows like like all the little Parables that Jesus taught the Kingdom of Heaven is like unto a woman that he had three measures uh the hit 11 and three major per meal and it began to grow and grow and it takes over because that stone is growing into a mountain until you are perfectly inconvenient with God's word and he has total control does everybody understand amen so yeah this is so simple it's so and and that's what really the the seals are the seals open up the you know I remember Dale talking about brother random was talking about the seventh seal and it seemed like he spent too much so much time talking about his own life because he could look back and see what God had done in his own life how God had brought him through all these things up this stature until he can look back and see the seals being broke see what God had done how God had Justified him and saved him and taken him from a vessel Of Dishonor into a vessel of Honor so now I hope it's clear what Lisa's speaking of Jeremiah 52 declarity among the Nations and published and set up a standard publish and conceal lot say Babylon is tinking Kingdom of Satan in your life Veil a confounder and I just put that note because Bill means the confounder the confounder is confounded Meredith the rebel is broken in pieces remember he had a he had the club to break in pieces her Idols are confounding her images are broken in pieces and that same language is used in Daniel chapter 2. thou saws till the stone was cut out without hands which smote the image upon his feet that were of iron and clay and break them to pieces why was the stone cut out with hands because it had nothing to do with man's ideas Jesus was not put into Mary's womb By Any Man man-made intervention that man had nothing to do with Jesus birth and man has nothing to do with the new birth it's something that God does and this statue of a perfect man is not something that you do by works it's God doing it it's a stone that was cut without hands to make you in the image of the mountain of of the uh of the great Eternal God so that he's building a church In His Image remember the Bible says that that Jesus was in the express image of the father then was the iron the clay the brass the silver and the gold broke into pieces together and became like the chaff of the summer and the wind carried them away that no place was found for them no place is found in your life when this process is complete for the devil it's blown away Blown Away by the word of God Blown Away by the spirit going away by what he's done and the stone that smoothie image became a great mountain and filled the whole Earth does that make sense that's so simple it's so so profound and so deep at the same time remember the ruble was throughout the school which the types Christ he said despise not the day of simple things because this is It's really it's really not complicated in the future home of the Heavenly bridegroom and the Earthly bride in 1964 Daniel saw the same thing a rock struck the world was heed out without hands and the whole image of the systems was broke down and become like shat chaff on the summer threshing floor and the wind packed it away and The Rock itself grew into a great Mountain the cover of the earth watch that mountain down a little bit that mountain to cover the Earth and then see he switches he's talking about you you're the same man and stature that you was when God called you same woman but you see what it did it was a regeneration the old life passed away the old desires passed away when you used to like to drink and cuss and fuss and stew and run around anymore that thing just died see but now you are used then it was God's instrument now you are redeemed see it's finished when you get the new birth but yet there's a process that you have to go through the Cornerstone and the headstone and when the Capstone comes it signifies that the price of God has accepted you you're you're in the image of the father the process is complete Redemption for you is complete so let's go back and look at those three things the number I wanted to do you want to build a strong nation which he did in other words he wanted to set up a kingdom he wanted to propagate his own religion which he did now see the baptism of the Holy Ghost when that Stone comes into your life that's not a religion it's not doing things just to satisfy a rule book but it's it's uh it's a lie it's the Life of Christ lived out in you he wanted to make a name for himself which he also accomplished now a real Christian doesn't want a name for themselves they want to take on his name right you're a real Christian oh Christian because you act like Christ the life Christ is made manifest in you that's why we don't we don't pray in Jesus name that's not just tacking words on the end of your prayer but it's signifying that the Life of Christ is living inside of you right and it's made manifest and you have taken on his name his power is dwelling inside of you so those three things compare with what what God wanted to do in his church now this is real comedian Christ The Mystery of God reveals 1963 . now notice again now what's his threefold purpose manifest itself in Jesus Christ to come into the body by Jesus Christ to have the preeminances to what restore backing bring that like bring back that which was lost that was the only thing out of order all the rest of his things was in order there's his threefold purpose to make himself manifest in Jesus Christ to make him himself manifest in the church and that see that's why that pyramid represents Christ the church and the New Jerusalem that City that came out from God out of Heaven the pyramid completeness restoration store back eat and bring back that which was lost who can condemn me of sin he said in Christ The Mystery of God I reveal if I do not the works of the father then where have I where have I felt now you fellas say that you're doing that you denomination now show me yeah show me where I fail to be the Messiah that's uh show where I fell on one sign that God said the Messiah would do that I have a feel that he said God in his body he's talking about say God in his body of Christ God in his body of church fulfilling his uh remembering Christ The Mystery of God revealed he read Colossians chapter one got down to verse 26-27 the mystery of God that Christ would be revealed in US this mystery that's hidden down from all the ages yes good question so you're saying that but of course the Cornerstone yes and of course if that Foundation is Jesus yes you start with Jesus the end of Jesus exactly the Capstone yes exactly I want to make sure that's what you were saying for that science really good I liked exactly so when the process is finished now now that's what brother Brandon kept focusing on you cannot get arrested between the the uh the I forget what you call these stones that cover over the pyramid that covering stones that a lot of them have had been stolen and whatnot but if they were still there you could they say you could see that pyramid light up at night or or during the day the sun would reflect off that pyramid it would just shine like a beacon and you couldn't get a razor blade between between your revelation of God's word and his word you could it just just dovetail exactly that all the way up you're in perfect communion that's how we have Community with one another how you can imagine the confusion if you have in the church if you have a lot of the ministers that aren't don't see eye to eye that just creates confusion but when everything's inconvenient and we're all working together and that's why you know brother random kept focusing look at the the how the Nicolaitans approach it where the the people don't really have anything to do with it it's it's all to the ministry you know the the whole church is supposed to be Spirit led the whole church is supposed to be in communion with God right because the whole church makes up this pyramid that's right and each individual remember in the Statue of perfect man he says the way the church is built up is the way the individual is built up dark with it is finished right and then when it is finished now that's kind of a confusing thing uh maybe we'll look at some scriptures that that are a little bit you know maybe used to be a little bit seem a little bit odd that you know that God will be all in all that everything's under his feet but it's not all we've got to wait a little bit for everything to be under his feet laughs so there's a famine in the land for God's word how do we get how do we get up to the to the uh how do we mature in this statue of perfect man so you see I'm kind of getting on both the latest topic a little bit because all these things oh you know we even overlap it's not separate separate topics the seals and Daniel 70 weeks and the staff's perfect man but it's all interwoven it's all really one topic that God is building up his church he's making a masterpiece and this is the Masterpiece amen and in the Old Testament there was a famine in the land and this is called the famine Steel and this tells about let me look at my notes Here uh Pharaoh Joker wrote that he was in distress on the great throne and he asked uh he asked his his advisor I asked him who was the Chamberlain Chamberlain M Hotel the son of Todd tah was the god that created all the other gods in the Egyptian mythology he was the head God the Creator so he this Pharaoh had a chief advisor that he asked for help when there was a famine in the land what is the perfect he asked him what is the birthplace of the Nile who's the god there he was the god in motel answered on you the guidance of him who presides over the family name I need some help let me go ask God I'm talking about when the King slept you see the the story is a little bit a little bit distorted to make the king look good when the King slept the Nile God knew revealed himself to him in a dream and promised the Nile pour forth for our Waters so this is a story of seven years of family in seven years of cleaning and it's written here about Frank Road Joseph and and his chief advisor in hotel and and if you kind of study um you can kind of compare Joseph and him Hotel Joseph was the second in command in the Pharaoh and hotel was the second command they both lived to be 110 both with great architecture Builder both stored up corns during seven years of plenty both saw seven years of family and fed people they both were interpreters of greens um uh Joseph's name was zafnaf panel which means the mouth the mouth of God and uh the God speaks and he lives the man who to whom Mysteries are revealed and M Hotel means the mouth of him which everybody says uh you know there's no there was no God named him but what if that was the mouth of I am and he is they're both instituted income tax of one-fifth they're both married in the priesthood of all they both had a knowledge of astrology um they both were educated people they both oversaw Public Works they both had a legendary history that continued on down uh Joseph is still taught up today him Hotel was a legendary man that was became worshiped uh for his for his wisdom and and uh and so forth um Joseph means um uh M Hotel means the one who comes in peace and Joseph means to add increase to join or gather together and they both were one of 12 siblings so that's interesting coincidence very interesting now in that time the the way the way to get uh they had to come to Joseph to receive to receive the the food and this day you got to to grow up this jacket or a perfect man the point I'm trying to make is you got to you got to dig into the word yourself you got to open it up and and what they did and now there's a quote brother and said these Mysteries that were hidden in the Mountain of God and I think it's interesting that that to come to get corn they went to a place where there was a pyramid you know this is this is the city of Sakara where they found uh they think this is where Joseph built this this whole complex where they they gave the food they stored up they had these huge pits in the ground where they stored grain and they even found grain in it today so to come to get spiritual food you go to the mountain you go to the they would go to this place where a pyramid was set up to receive Food just to kind of look at this and imagine Joseph's brothers coming up to meet him and everything to to uh going through that whole story um but you know God has made a way for us through this prophet's message to receive in in a spiritual family where the there's a famine in the land of the word God has given us the ability to reap so I just want to I'm just kind of bringing this up to as an encouragement to dig into the word and see if these things are true because that's just such a type that we're going to the mountain the mountain of the Lord and I I was reading through all these um these these uh dreams there was like six dreams that that different people had before um the cloud before the seventh seal and they were all speaking of going to the mountain you know brother Brown uh brother Junior Jackson had a dream where he took the Crowbar and opened up uh he saw brother Branham going into the mountain and and taking out Mysteries and things and and these these Mysteries are hidden in the mountain that's right and and back then they went maybe traveling by Campbell for miles around to see this mountain this pyramid sticking up so they went to get to get this corn to get their food he built this whole complex where there's there's a little uh places under the city and just a little uh where you could go underground and get corn and whatnot yeah who's that is I see what he said in the greatest battle ever fall they had this dream where uh some some brothers were trying to follow along they wanted to kind of live the same life he did and and The Boatman told him but what you need to do is lay up provision so they they'll stay behind and just just just eat and he said I was just ordering all kinds of cabbages and turnips and radishes and things pile them in there like that then I woke up and and read a few paragraphs down now this is what I'm saying this morning is storing food storing food so that you'll have something to eat so that you'll have something to Feast upon get it on your tapes set in the cool of the room now this is what really what I've been talking about if you get in communion if you don't understand what's being priest upstairs you don't understand on the tapes get on get on the in the cool of the room make sure you open it up and meditate on it and think about it and pray set in the cool because that's really what convenient is it's a communion between you and God communion with his word set in the cool of the room maybe when I'm a long ways away you'll still remember these things are true sit in your room and listen see and this is food storing in in the storehouse what's up and there's the quote The Mystery of the Seven Seals that was sealed up on the inside of that mountain of the Lord now this is the dream that Junior Jackson had let's go ahead and read that and then we'll maybe stop on this remember Judy Jackson's dream that time we went out there Judy dreamed that he saw this how many remembers of the dream and how the lord gave the interpretation that great Mountain we were standing upon it an old washed out letters there and I was trying to interpret it and I couldn't do it and I was interpreting it to him after I got it all interpreted all the interpreted then I reached over and got in his dream house some kind of like a bar and just cut the top of the mountain off and looked in there and it was all snow-like like marble but it wasn't written on and I said you all stay here and look in on this now well I'll go Yonder and Juni all of them went up and all the brothers and all looking in on it another they couldn't understand said well what do you know it's not even written here but yet he was reading the outside of it why isn't it written in here we can't understand and Junior turned around and looked and he seen me going towards the West towards the city of the Sun going over at one mountain Another Mountain real fast just getting and then he turned around and looked and seen me going a whole big group of them took off that way and they want to go this and do after that and do that after I told them to stay there stay there stay right there right here this is the place and then when I did that then and I went just exactly a little bit after that the angel of the Lord appeared to me to say go out to Arizona Yonder I heard that blast go off and went there and what was it that boy dreamed that dream just exactly right and the lord gave the right remember I said there's something I'm going there for and when I went there it was the mystery of the Seven Seals that was sealed up on the inside of the mountain of the Lord and and there's another quote where you said people they told them to stay right there and meditate on it and some went this way somewhere there but there's going to be a few people that will stay right with this and stay with it until you come into communion perfect communion and we'll just we'll just stop right there foreign
