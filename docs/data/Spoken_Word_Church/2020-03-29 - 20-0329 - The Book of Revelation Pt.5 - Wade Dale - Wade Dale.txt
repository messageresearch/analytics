========================================

okay all right good to be a house Lord today take the beam with all of you here practicing social distancing but I hope you weren't distant from the Lord of this week I don't we all have a little quiet town with the Lord indeed these got hold picture puzzle that 500,000 piece puzzle together get to know each other a little bit better maybe also did some money but good it'd be enough for today we're going to begin or continue our series on the book of Revelation so I hadn't thought about doing it but about three or four I get every question that we do it so will how I feel it anyway so let's start with revelations three I think we got here to the church and Sardis which is the turntable Martin Luther says unto the Angel of the Church of Sardis write these things that he doesn't have to seven spirits of God and the Seven Stars I know that works the time I've been named it they live it and are dead and we know what that is even in that started easy in church age they were still baptized in the name of the Father Son Holy Ghost and now that's a name that that liveth and I'm dead now that's coming out of the Dark Ages coming out of the time of Columba that we were talking about think any to Martin Luther headed toward the Reformation which started really a restoration but they were under Reformation because of this right here you're not to reform mister just to get people to come back and under justification get the people to come back to God and coming back to God and God allowed even them to baptize in the name of Father Son Holy Ghost give them the baptism of the Holy Ghost because that would be only like they had they didn't have the light remember the light of the name of Lord Jesus Christ was buried in the Dark Ages by the Catholic Church by the 325 AD in 606 AD when they come together saying that Jesus was a life sentence of God not do something do something some done so they split him up into three God the Father God the Son God the Holy Ghost but now we know he's one person just like we are one person I'm my name though this one I'm one person I'm a father then when my dad comes up to me I become a son at that time because I'm the son I'm saying the Bell but then also when Josh walks up to me I become a father and then when Deana my grandbaby walks up to me I'm with my title my person doesn't change but my title changes the grandpa all right it's that pretty simple that God is not three different personalities which have to talk to each other to get an opinion of what's going on though it's one mine one Lord Jesus Christ who is God Almighty now we know there's positions because remember when he was on earth the one inside of him was the father okay but remember you can't then though when Jesus said I'll go away and I'll send you another comforter but now jesus said I'll come back so it's not a different you know there was the Holy Ghost waiting up there in heaven until the day of Pentecost no the Holy Ghost was in welcome Jordan Galilee if not anyone god he was the fullness of the Godhead bottom right being that he was as John one says the word was made flesh and blood among us then he transferred that now we know Jesus the flesh is not here truly he is in another dimension but it's not another God that he sent or another person that he sent because you know as well as I've been God being perfect being infinite these that matter three people are just as equal as they can be we are different personality so we would have somewhere in our life we'd have a conflict even though we're in harmony with God and all that somewhere because Bob would not go settle in the beer stand hey zero degrees and deer hunt and he says that's right but now being brother Danny fountain we've done it and we'll continue to do it when we can so there we have a conflict but that's a personality because a person is different that's why you can't say God in three persons in case somebody's watching in that art that has the trendy doctrine and even Martin Luther still had it but God went to take this from Martin Luther because all he all he was commissioned to do was right here strengthen the things we've remained that the ready to die for I've not found thy works perfect before God want father son Holy Ghost is not a perfect acted under permissive will it was okay because they didn't have light for that day okay so there's no three personalities of God you know even even though their denomination say well Jesus was God well how was he got well he was the second person of the Trinity when you bring that word person in you bought you that you separated and God's not confusing he's not the arthur confusion he's not confused and he's not confused the Holy Ghost long ago what do you mean by that no it's the same person so he he's the same person but there is a flesh died in another dimension because that flesh had to go away so he could send the Holy Spirit so that he could because remember when he was here on earth in a human body he could not go into the believer because he was the corn wheat that had to die and when he come up all this happened come up now on the resurrection day 120 little Jesus's that we spoke before then 3,000 of Jesus's and then we got little Jesus is sitting here today all because that one God died in human flesh took the flesh into another dimension to wait on the works to be done through the believers that's the way I see it it's just this it's not to be done through a book or a tape it's really not it's to be done to human believers that's the way he said that and the Word was made flesh today the word was made flesh and dwelt among us we are the word made manifest in human flesh the only difference we are is is we are different personalities but now when it comes to the Word of God me and brother Bob brother Danny brother Ryan yeah I can't play their own board nothing not even one can be to stick together but brother Ryan can see that's what we would be personality differences he'd like me to connect form I didn't but exactly have different things that he that he likes that I don't that's pretty but when we come and talk about the Word of God then that's when we all connect back together because your soul the real you that's been born again does it think I can use it right right he doesn't think like it used to these been transformed deposited by the renewing of our mind person of the Holy Ghost is now residing in you we just got online in human flesh right here that's where people know that you know a lot of a lot of denominations going have a problem with Jesus dying for the sins 2,000 years ago but to put that actual person not the flesh but the Holy Ghost that was released put that back inside of you and you got to act like him that's where you know that's where you have different personalities but remember will tell my doctor when you see doctrine excuse me it's not I'm not sick it's just it's just the allergies that's coming up in the any air being a beekeeper I like this time of the year cuz everything's green and everything's got pollen all over it so that means my bees are working hard and they really are but he knows what the science of granting someone but Martin Luther was commissioned to bring her a cup Tallis ISM that was dark in the dark ages they were killing Christian six and a half million I killed little Christian trying to get them to convert to that person of a God where the little minority of the Christians that took the night we know God we know Jesus Christ his own mind going into place and now he was higher than us kind of churches know he was eyes in the Pope and the Pope and the church at 81 today so Martin Luther brought my lap under Reformation but the Bible says I will restore so God started restoration in a small degree come out of her my people so Martin Luther's grip come out but they were still under a name with no limits and heard and I remember Martin Luther went David the way we think Dave now he had life in him but the rock the false doctrine was David tell then we might many mighty works done under Martin Luther John Wesley disappoint well if the Holy Ghost wasn't there when the whole one inside of them but the way I this is just the way I see it the Holy Ghost is the same Holy Ghost means you had but when Martin Luther would take somebody in baptize with nail polish on Holy Ghost that inside man had to be struggling with this is not right but he didn't know how to handle that and there wasn't enough word remember the Bible became written during this time - during this time here this is what the Bible was compiled together and put in a book we call a Bible so really Martin Luther started to learn a little bit about the Bible what I'm saying is acts 2:38 wasn't revealed to me it was being compiled in the Bible but acts 2:38 wasn't revealed Martin couldn't when time God went to digging up some man he started with two shoes he had started with the tree he's starting with the two shoes but there was a laugh than those two shoe not the light went out of the two suits and went into the stop but it doesn't make the chute you can't go out there today and start taking corn and there's only two sheep sticking up about this high now potentially this corn potentially it has to pull this of the baptism of the holy go during the Martin Luther day potentially but you got away go ahead wait until the light came out of this got enough sunlight photosynthesis started working in dental oh shoot started coming out called John Wesley and that come out with the stop you got to have a stop to put a piece of corn on the end up mm-hmm so it's all important be watchful and strengthen those things which remain in other words Martin Luther looked at the Catholic Church and says there's some things that I do approve up now they have some things they do believe Jesus was gone but they just believed he's another Trent they don't deny that we see then they had an Mary in there and all these different things and they add to the word hmm but the word was never not a strength because when Martin Luther ready to just show them my faith that clicked a lot on and he said hey we don't have to do penance anymore we don't have to drag ourselves through the streets or flack to let ourselves you know with the whips like they do you watch over in the Philippines I was watching them a YouTube video the other day about the Easter service in the different parts of the world well brother they don't went over there when the next up is actually this guy actually gets nailed to the cross and people have a parade and they put have a will and they put little hooks on the end of it and you'll watch them I mean there's flame blood it's just ready to the table they're just waiting blood everywhere that laying down on the ground but they're Catholic they're trying to get rid of their sin my works Martin Luther City not a word it's a faith the just shall live by faith if you've been justified you've got to be living by bags like we've been talking about with Abraham all right be watchful and strengthen the things which remain that are ready to die rather not found thy works perfect before God or that word would be complete because they weren't complete you can't you can't take a baptism and then father son Holy Ghost to the headstone right somewheres had to be done away with because remember Jesus was to headstone and whatever he taught that's why it's gotta come back to it that's fine that this prophet and the end time had to restore that back to the faith of the Father remember therefore how thou has received and heard and hold fast and repent how'd they hear Martin Luther comes up at the end of the Catholic age Martin Luther come I start preaching the just shall live by faith he puts the 95 theses on the door said this is what I don't agree with the Catholic Church Czech Catholic Church mm-hmm as we said before I hope we understand this that the reason Protestantism came to be was because they were protesting that's what Protestant main protest they were protesting the Catholic Church cuz then you've got Catholics and you've got Protestants well it's now until this day but remember the model says it all wines right back up into the catholicism so the daughter's the harlot daughters are going to finally agree with the mother and they're gonna go right back in and that's why we'll go to that seven churches a little bit later and we see they leave their first love for sure and they go back to what the old mother that started down here before church age and they'll all bow to Catholic Church finally saw the Pope moving around yesterday he's gonna see any understand we see so he's not sick as they presented it yes but I'm sure he blocked tight in the Vatican they're they're dying by the thousands in Italy so I'm sure he's uh distancing himself because he's their Vicar he's their Cardinal hurt I guess to keep that well he died what happened this need a vote another guy hand and then God just moves from that vessel into this mess it's all built on tradition and all religions so but now listen there's good people and all of them there's some devout Catholics that would make us look back go to church every Mass every Sunday morning there they go every day and thank Matt there's man this kind of Turkey every day so they go take the weight from them and the Eucharist and all the different things and they're from really devout Catholics and let God judge them but the ones that are going to be really judged by God is ones in the hierarchy thick down the terror on the people after we leave you see these things working now where our governments coming up with all this money and I keep thinking that there was may have been called in the Vatican but hey can you back this because you know Wow all he's got to do it say yeah or no and then we shift our leisure to childhood but that's the way it's both in we know that we read tomorrow's news today I don't think this virus is the end of the world but it does put things in motion let's see how now we're meeting now the whole day to shut the place down and so you can't get it over more than 10 feet right so here we go which is fine I'm not scattered I'm cautious we need all be cautious to help be scared and don't have any fear I don't have any fear about any of that hey I look I'm a postal worker I took thousands of pieces of mail and I touch 650 mailboxes every day so I'm fine but let's don't be foolish I was reading I'm gonna try to pull it up read it this afternoon but there was a lady center Facebook posted I believe in God but I don't reach in the oven and get them and get the pan out without followers I don't get in the car without gas and was seatbelt you know I don't do these things differently now now but now the reverse of that is you say well you got faith will if something happens and you have to put your hand in a fire to help somebody or an emergency and God clear that far away which we've seen it many times we can get stuff spilled oil and all that now that's faith in the believing of God of the healer but let's don't let's not provoke God the Bible says don't provoke me so let's don't let's not provoke God in other words just don't go stand out in the middle that road and wait for a tractor-trailer oil god stop that tractor-trailer well we'll say let's just don't tempt God now maybe if you run out to help somebody like that stop the tractor trailer he did that one June one time well we go get a few minutes where I'm gonna get a whole lot further than that but they've come down money well Mountain her dad whether it's been 10 or 15 years ago car slipped over people were thrown out and you ever be no money a mountain coming down the mountains like this I mean you have to gear way down and it's just like this all the way down so in front of them that was a Hispanic couple husband and wife and baby about it six months is year old something like that we went to make a long story short the baby got thrown out in the middle of a road this the four lanes I think coming down the mountain and here comes all the traffic and here comes a tractor-trailer and June didn't want to move the baby because she didn't what can i Andres you might kill it or dirt if it's broke or back broke so she just stood up like this with her hands right over the baby's car you stood up like this right here with her hand and to make a long story short the tractor-trailer stopped within about ten feet of that baby of course immediately put the brakes on turn flashers on and everybody started going actually he was a shield so when the mercy people got there they that big truck was sitting there and he was the baby him unfortunately I think the baby passed away the state it was alive the gym you know she's not EMT but she took Red Cross you know safety courses and all that stuff when we had to take care so she was certified to administer like a first response medication or not meditation bit come keep it steady and all that stuff anyway I miss you and the guys just you know in 10 feet away didn't jack knob didn't do any of that right down in front of a big stop so we take thoughtful that see now that would be running out in the middle of the road and God preserving and protecting you taking what you do it but let's go probe well tonight and all this please don't provoke good still wash your hands still do the things you're supposed to do and we'll be fine we'll get back together don't worry remember therefore how thou has received and heard and hold fast and repent what they listen to what their messenger said hold fast to it they held fast to Martin Luther's message of the just shall live by faith they repented of their past that's not justification repent on you past sins they repented of their past and they began walking in newness of life now their Holy Ghost it's the same Holy Ghost like I said we had but it's in a very mind even for me it was compressed by there was not enough word for it to fully reveal itself right there my god that the analogy I'll use many times out like they were saying before but but if you do this right here and you focus right on the Bob well I see Bob but now there's brother Danny brother Ryan and Rose likes it here now I've only seen I've only seen Bo Bob why because my eye of faith has been covered over and if I didn't know y'all were in the room I would only think Bob's in a room well that's justification that's what God was happy to look at mark and Martin Luther the look in the Word of God and say the just shall live by faith didn't have a whole lot of revelation at all before all the other things that were revealed well then John Wesley God just open their eyes a little bit more there brother Danny and brother Bob but now I don't see brother Ron I don't see better back then when you come to the baptism the Holy Ghost this more of the word revealed now the focus of the word the seals have been opened the books been opened so we're under an open book that's why we always say that and it's become an icon of story in our in our the way we see things but it's true our eyes our faith has been we went up like the eagle and we can see 360 all the way around we can see further than anybody camp so these great revelations of one God the baptism in the name of Lord Jesus Christ being correct baptism no Trinitarian doctrine that God is one God and Jesus is his name and then we need to to be connected to that family Jesus at baptize in the name of the Father and of the son named wovoka who is that father than our name son huh name Holy Ghost is not a name it's a title just like me when I say my times grandfather now my otoscope grandfather brother died all right so the Martin Luther's church age that God that I saw was the judge show that buffet justification to just and the justifier one person died came on the scene in the baptism of the Holy Ghost baptized them into the family but they only could see this much of the word because it wasn't time that was only two shoots it's not the full grain now the full grain is coming and Martin Luther did his job and went off the scene and then some of them look remember therefore we'll stop right it's down 55 will you ready to go remember therefore how thou has received and heard and hold fast and repent if therefore thou shalt not watch I will come visit thee and thou shalt not know what hour come upon day in other words keep watching because this is not the end yeah there's more to come right that has the few names even in sardis which have not defiled their garments in other words there was they group there they had to work all right and they shall walk with me in white for they are worthy then look we'll talk about healing overcoming next time you it's 9:55 mm to this book there be careful be safe don't do anything stupid wash your hands don't sneeze be sick stay home practice social distancing if you'll do those things I'll guarantee you look this thing it's not it's only airborne when it comes out of my mouth this mouth it's not something that's gonna float around in the air no it's a person-to-person and I hate it when you look out you see it like blaming Trump but if you blame somebody you need to blame yourself call the plays have come upon us well the landing yourself that I'm not right with God enough to where I can go outside and say peace be still hello so know Trump didn't bring it China as a government didn't bring it everybody blaming everybody else I just blame myself but I can't stand outside the day and go Hall County go to the hospital and clear the hospital does he remember it's not a public show so what but individually we can pray we can pray for these people you pray for people because they're individuals and they're humans they're human beings that are dying I was thinking last night every time any diving in Italy if it's not Christians we know what's gonna happen I just pray that people become Christian than that you know there are dead big commission or whatever you want to say but statements once they say we'll get through this I believe that you know I I don't know if it's gonna be done by April but we may have a July 4th Independence knows but just listen be vigilant I still gotta work several of us dinner essential work with Ryan's got to work and don't give you that or not God will provide our needs I promise you you wait he always had the Ali's will brother Damon without work for over a year and God provided his need you know what he done though let me give you a little a little example he took out some long term answer before this happened to take care of all that for brother than anyone willing you see but but he and I believe the Holy Spirit tells you plans to do it not today now we listen sometimes we don't and we we we read both sides so as a Christian I think God's gonna help us he's anybody's and I'll lead you and guide you into all truth let's go up there is going kind of god bless you all [Music]
