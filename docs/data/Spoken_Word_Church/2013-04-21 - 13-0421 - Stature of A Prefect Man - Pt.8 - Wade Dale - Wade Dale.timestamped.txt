[0:01] all right let's uh let's go ahead and
[0:04] turn to Second Peter
[0:08] one oh I took yours
[0:12] I'm sorry
[0:20] yeah yeah they videoed the funeral
[0:23] online
[0:33] did you find it
[0:35] oh
[0:38] there is one underneath the seat in
[0:42] front of me that has your name on it
[0:43] that's not it oh that's not normal
[0:45] but did you get that one uh
[0:49] okay I'll read along with the rest okay
[0:53] brother Tracy left some conversionary
[0:55] today
[1:00] are they huge fans
[1:07] all right second Peter's chapter one
[1:10] just go ahead and get started
[1:15] now we're wavy
[1:19] I got it change no change the color
[1:21] first the time it's like 10 minutes yeah
[1:23] so you're gonna pop up every 10 minutes
[1:25] okay that is so annoying there you go
[1:28] thank you
[1:32] okay all right
[1:35] look at Peter chapter one
[1:42] I think today we'll just continue just
[1:44] maybe one more
[1:46] um
[1:47] Sunday school class on making sure our
[1:50] life is correct making sure everything
[1:52] we're doing is right if we're not born
[1:54] again at least we're working towards
[1:56] something and if we are born again then
[1:59] we're really
[2:01] looking towards something okay amen all
[2:05] right so even if you're not or if you
[2:07] are we're still working I want us to be
[2:09] aware of the fact that you're one of the
[2:11] others
[2:12] you're not in between you're one of the
[2:15] other you're either working toward being
[2:16] born again are you being born again
[2:20] up to Statue of a perfect man already
[2:22] born again in the body of Christ all
[2:24] right so you're one of the two right so
[2:27] we want to we want and it's not bad
[2:29] being one of the other
[2:31] it's just bad not knowing whether you're
[2:33] one of the other all right being
[2:35] deceived or being like we were talking
[2:37] about being anti-word all right for
[2:40] being anti-word that makes us against
[2:42] the word of God right and we know that
[2:44] we are against the word of God and
[2:47] this natural life because something is
[2:49] bringing us together because I said the
[2:51] statue of a perfect man
[2:53] not the statue of a perfect theophany
[2:55] but if you're born again you have a
[2:57] perfectly often so this is the statue of
[3:00] perfect man this is bringing everything
[3:02] together
[3:04] fitly joint the Bible says bringing
[3:07] everything together all the all the
[3:09] joints and all the fingers working right
[3:11] and you know these little fingers are
[3:13] are pretty insignificant sometimes but
[3:16] you need them
[3:17] like dad's always said about fingernails
[3:20] fingernails are not so
[3:22] you know you just kind of
[3:24] do with them but boy when you need to be
[3:28] scratched or if somebody pulls one off
[3:29] or if you cut one down in the quick you
[3:32] sure know that that thing's there so
[3:34] that's the thing we want to do when the
[3:35] body of Christ if we know that there's a
[3:37] place in our body that that needs work
[3:39] you know what God's gonna do he's going
[3:42] to say hey that part's important that's
[3:43] right
[3:44] he's gonna say hey this part's important
[3:46] he's going to bring it up to you and say
[3:48] this is important or this is important
[3:49] or this is important okay so second
[3:52] Peter chapter one
[3:54] I've been reading this book we're going
[3:55] to read it again because I want the
[3:57] emphasis to be what brother random we're
[3:59] going to read this quote here after
[4:00] we're finished Simon Peter servant and
[4:02] Apostle of Jesus Christ to them that
[4:05] have obtained
[4:07] there's an entrance they have you have
[4:09] obtained something all right like
[4:11] Precious Faith with us through the
[4:13] righteousness of God and our Savior
[4:16] Jesus Christ Grace of peace be
[4:18] multiplied unto you through the
[4:19] knowledge of God and of Jesus our lord
[4:20] according as his divine power hath given
[4:24] unto us all things so he's giving us
[4:26] divine power according to his divine
[4:27] power he's going to give us divine power
[4:30] have given unto us all things that
[4:32] pertaining to life and godliness all
[4:34] right so you see that word life
[4:37] and godliness now if Peter's already
[4:40] born again he's not talking about the
[4:42] life of God so much that's a dual
[4:44] meaning there
[4:46] you see where he separated he said life
[4:49] and godliness
[4:50] well your life in this world is not
[4:52] godliness okay that's right so he's
[4:55] separating the two he's saying okay this
[4:57] is going to be that pertain
[5:00] learn to life
[5:02] everyday living just like what we're
[5:04] talking about making the world a better
[5:05] place it's not just feeling good or a
[5:07] good thinking you know you have to feel
[5:09] good about yourself that's true how many
[5:11] times like talking about sister Johnny
[5:12] and uh being making you know I just
[5:14] realized when I walked through something
[5:17] and like in the car lot out there
[5:19] somebody they throw stuff on the ground
[5:21] all the time while I go by and pick it
[5:22] up I feel bad if I walk back and see it
[5:24] sitting there and have to go do
[5:25] something and forget about it and go
[5:27] back because I want it I want it better
[5:29] I don't care if it's perfect but I want
[5:32] it better
[5:33] I want it better than I left that's why
[5:34] when we go to places when we go to
[5:36] functions and when we go to places that
[5:38] out in the world when you go to a
[5:40] restaurant when you go to places like
[5:42] that I've seen people in the message and
[5:44] sorry but they've had a bunch of kids
[5:45] and they don't pay no attention to them
[5:47] and it's just stuff all over the floor
[5:49] looks like the foods exploded in the
[5:51] floor now I don't agree with that I
[5:53] don't agree with that at all I just
[5:55] don't think that's a lot of got a lot of
[5:57] godliness to it right all right now
[5:59] we're talking about life you should
[6:00] clean up your mess I'm sorry you say oh
[6:04] it's a little bit
[6:06] that person is going to walk in and
[6:08] clean up and say this was a sorry person
[6:10] so see there you got the connection
[6:13] but that's why we leave things better
[6:15] when we go camping up in the mountains I
[6:18] tell them the last morning on Saturday
[6:20] we send them out on an Excursion we even
[6:23] clean up what's not even ours
[6:25] we cleaned up so far out where there's
[6:27] no question of what we left behind
[6:30] we might leave wood but we stacked the
[6:33] wood up against a tree we leave the fire
[6:35] pit where somebody else can use it we
[6:36] leave the things you say well that's
[6:38] just yeah that's just being good because
[6:41] you know what if you're a Christian and
[6:42] being good that puts you closer to being
[6:44] Godly that's right
[6:47] some of these people are just going to
[6:48] be good out in the world but see Peter
[6:51] says life and godliness he he separates
[6:53] them but then he puts them back together
[6:55] life and godliness he's talking about
[6:57] life
[6:58] and the godliness with living that life
[7:00] all right because we're the only one
[7:02] that can live a Godly life right
[7:05] through the knowledge of him that have
[7:07] called us to glory and virtue whereby
[7:10] are given those are gifts unto a
[7:12] succeeding great impression promises
[7:14] that by these you might be partakers of
[7:17] the divine nature having escaped the
[7:18] corruption that is in the world through
[7:20] lust all right excuse me and besides
[7:23] this giving all diligence foreign
[7:30] virtue and divert your knowledge into
[7:32] knowledge Temperance into Temperance
[7:34] patience into patience godliness and the
[7:36] godliness brotherly kindness and to
[7:38] brotherly kindness
[7:40] charity
[7:42] if you'll notice
[7:46] as looking at this in in terms of
[7:49] English
[7:50] look where it says right here add to
[7:52] temperance
[7:54] patience patience regardless there's no
[7:56] comma there
[7:57] a comma is a pause right
[8:00] to bring a little more of a thought
[8:01] there's not even a common layer so
[8:03] you're adding to what I'm saying you
[8:06] don't even pause you just keep going
[8:07] right these keep going right on through
[8:09] these things all right there's no
[8:10] comments there and the knowledge because
[8:12] I just looked down because it says right
[8:14] here and the godliness brotherly
[8:15] kindness there's no
[8:17] there's no stop no add to Godliness
[8:21] brotherly kind you just keep this at it
[8:23] right up just keep right on adding to it
[8:24] that's why I think these are Blended
[8:26] together they're not something and we we
[8:29] can we do give them as an example of a
[8:32] stair step but they're really not
[8:35] you build on this one to get to the next
[8:37] one sure but it's just a flowing up and
[8:39] down of Faith virtue in all these
[8:41] different patience godliness and
[8:42] brothers and kindness I mean there's
[8:44] only lines in the pyramid just for the
[8:47] purpose of separating them so that we
[8:50] can see them right I wish there was a
[8:52] way that we could take those lines out
[8:54] because they're really not you don't get
[8:57] you don't fill up with virtue and then
[9:00] stop and then get no more virtue and
[9:02] then fill up with knowledge and stop and
[9:03] get no more knowledge no it just keeps I
[9:06] wish there was a way you could blend all
[9:07] them words together and just keep
[9:09] pushing them up
[9:10] that's what he's doing right he's taking
[9:12] us all the way up you never
[9:14] you never get to a point where virtue is
[9:16] no good to you anymore
[9:18] right right
[9:19] never so virtue doesn't stop down there
[9:22] and then you add but you for an hour
[9:26] English language or or for our
[9:28] explanation we have to put add to your
[9:31] faith virtue but there's no common there
[9:33] it's just continuation right
[9:36] yeah listen
[9:40] get back over here the fans turning the
[9:42] face all right and the godliness
[9:44] brotherly kindness and the brotherly
[9:45] kindness charity there's no commodary
[9:48] they're just absolutely flows right on
[9:49] in okay or if these things be on you
[9:55] bro what's that say in you
[9:58] not on you
[10:00] own you they fall off the Winds of the
[10:04] world and the cares of the world and the
[10:06] lust of the world will do what they'll
[10:08] just blow it right off of you
[10:10] but if you're inside this building
[10:13] you're part of this building
[10:15] if you're outside the building
[10:17] you're not a part of the building but
[10:19] you're inside this building so in if
[10:21] these things be in you and abound in
[10:23] other words overflow
[10:25] like we were talking about the dream the
[10:26] other day about sister Shepard about her
[10:28] dream that she had where the water was
[10:31] just boiling out of the top all right
[10:34] and about they make you that word their
[10:37] make just like you'd make your child do
[10:39] something it's just going to make you if
[10:41] you do these things right
[10:44] what it's just going to become common to
[10:46] you it's just going to become something
[10:47] that you do without even thinking right
[10:50] right becomes a part of you becomes a
[10:53] part of your everyday life brother Brown
[10:55] instead of walking breathing living
[10:57] instrumentation of God walking breathing
[11:02] living
[11:05] all right you said a lot of things I do
[11:07] not godly well maybe you're not God I'm
[11:09] gone in this yet
[11:10] but you're doing the things toward that
[11:12] all right because you know what you got
[11:15] to use virtue to have knowledge you got
[11:17] to use knowledge and virtue to have
[11:19] temper that's what I'm saying you don't
[11:21] take first you and just have virtue and
[11:22] then put it aside and say now I've got
[11:23] knowledge and put it aside no you use
[11:26] virtue to have knowledge
[11:28] because what is virtual strength you
[11:30] have to have strength to know that God's
[11:32] right know that the word's right know
[11:34] that the knowledge of God is right then
[11:36] you take the virtue and knowledge that
[11:37] you've get
[11:39] and that teaches you to be patient
[11:42] got it then you take that part and add
[11:46] it and then you got patience
[11:51] then God then see what I'm saying you
[11:53] got you need all these and and it took
[11:55] them a man like Peter to put them in
[11:57] line and then it took a prophet of God
[11:59] to explain every one of them
[12:02] virtuous strength and you draw strength
[12:05] like Peter Silver and Gold Have I None
[12:06] see Peter Peter when he wrote this he'd
[12:09] already witnessed him
[12:11] they knew he had virtue because he had
[12:13] something to give that guy out on the
[12:15] street called or the gay called
[12:16] Beautiful all right
[12:17] they make you that you shall neither be
[12:20] Barren nor unfruitful now how many times
[12:23] I know a lot of you don't have fruit
[12:24] trees but I have a a
[12:27] plum tree
[12:28] that bears every other year
[12:30] I bought me two more of the uh this year
[12:33] to go in between them years but I love
[12:36] plums
[12:37] but you know what that tree's not near
[12:40] as pretty now
[12:41] it don't have anything for me to go get
[12:44] it's unfruitful
[12:47] right
[12:48] but boy next year
[12:51] it's going to have those great big plums
[12:53] on it
[12:54] and also most of y'all some of y'all
[12:56] have come by and ate them they're big
[12:57] old plums you know they're really good
[12:59] well you know I don't care much for that
[13:01] tree now
[13:03] but now next year I don't care for it
[13:04] because I'll look out there and see them
[13:06] big old plums on it right
[13:08] they know I wasn't standing pick them
[13:10] and even right off the tree well that
[13:12] means it's the tree was fruitful but I
[13:14] ain't gonna go out there tomorrow and do
[13:15] it or the next day or anytime this year
[13:17] there's no fruit on it
[13:19] and I know that because
[13:22] I see what it bears
[13:24] you understand what I'm saying okay so
[13:27] same way with you and I it says right
[13:28] here that said You shall neither be
[13:31] Barren nor unfruitful that's a promise
[13:35] in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus
[13:37] Christ but he that lacketh these things
[13:39] is blind and cannot see it far often has
[13:41] forgotten that he was purged
[13:43] from his old sin wherefore the rather
[13:45] Brethren give diligence how many times
[13:48] he said diligence diligence diligence
[13:51] delegates to make your calling and
[13:53] election sure that's what we're doing
[13:55] now we're finding out whether we're
[13:58] really born again or whether we're not
[14:00] right and it's good to find out both
[14:03] right it's because you can do something
[14:05] but if you're deceived then you're just
[14:07] deceived there's just no
[14:10] there's no help but God
[14:12] 's the only one that can
[14:15] break you out of that
[14:17] whether the rather Brethren give
[14:18] diligence to make your calling an
[14:20] election sure for if you do these things
[14:23] you shall never fall
[14:27] okay we're gonna stumble and trip he
[14:31] said you won't fall because you can't
[14:32] fall if you gotten a new birth
[14:36] yeah you can fall from these virtues
[14:40] you don't get them automatically at the
[14:42] new birth you have to grow all right
[14:45] just like Jonas he's got everything he
[14:47] needs to drive a car but he's got a
[14:51] grow he's gotta get some character about
[14:55] him and that's what those are those
[14:56] those are character virtues that's right
[14:58] you know I'm never gonna be a quiet
[15:01] person
[15:03] but I can use my loudness
[15:08] to maybe get a point across to you or
[15:11] not being so quiet and timid maybe okay
[15:13] I'm not gonna be fine Timmy because I
[15:15] believe what I know I don't know what I
[15:16] believe and I just believe that and I'm
[15:19] just at the place where I do nobody's
[15:21] gonna shake me off these old doctrines
[15:22] that people have got in the way that
[15:24] people act and and the way the people
[15:25] act in the world and think that's not
[15:27] going to bother me
[15:31] go ahead
[16:30] but you say that's insignificant and
[16:33] that's just oh that's Mr wet no
[16:36] somewhere down the line that's going to
[16:38] come back to you it's just like I ran in
[16:40] here this is promises that God give us
[16:42] somewhere that's going to come back to
[16:44] you it may not be in somebody and not
[16:46] falling for or in water but
[16:50] you'll never know maybe till you get
[16:52] over there that they would be a
[16:53] Christian walk by and was going to slip
[16:55] and fall you say well y'all gotta know
[16:57] that
[16:59] and that's the way he that's the way
[17:02] he's leading in guiding us I don't I'm
[17:04] like Daddy I don't think Jesus just got
[17:05] up in the morning and said okay I'm gone
[17:06] I gotta act like God no he went about
[17:08] his duty but he was so much gone till
[17:10] the things of the world didn't bother
[17:12] him
[17:13] he had a mission he had he had a way he
[17:15] had to go and he went that way
[17:17] he was led of the Lord to do things and
[17:19] you say letter of the Lord to get a
[17:21] puddle of water up well why not
[17:22] we've had manifesting God in you not
[17:26] going to manifest himself anyway and to
[17:28] manifest himself I gotta show other
[17:31] people see it but you don't see it
[17:33] yourself
[17:34] and that's manifesting you said we want
[17:36] to have a Priceless experience and then
[17:38] have a crash size tooth you guys
[17:44] I mean
[17:46] you don't know who's watching you either
[17:48] right right that's it right you don't
[17:50] know who's watching you either I know
[17:52] who's watching us right but you know
[17:55] really these uh that brings up a point
[17:56] let me make this point and you may
[17:57] appear
[17:59] that's really those are not for God
[18:04] seeing us that's right
[18:07] those are not for God to see in US God's
[18:10] all-knowing he knows we're gonna who's
[18:12] gonna get up there to love so he's
[18:15] sitting back and watching what you'll do
[18:17] that's right so that you'll have
[18:19] confidence that's what this says here it
[18:21] says to happen that you'll never fall if
[18:24] you do these things
[18:26] there's an absolute way to get to God
[18:30] and to be like God there's a way to give
[18:33] to God which is have faith then there's
[18:35] a way to be like God is to do these
[18:36] virtues virtue knowledge and let people
[18:38] see it in you that's the witness that's
[18:41] going to be on the day of judgment it's
[18:42] not going to be a Bible it's going to be
[18:44] laying there on the day of judgment it's
[18:45] got things written out
[18:47] um uh if this is Johnny walked by water
[18:50] and no it's not gonna be that
[18:53] you're gonna know and the person that
[18:55] either slept or fell or didn't slip
[18:57] they're gonna know that's why we got an
[19:00] eternity for these things to just unfold
[19:02] the Bible says the former things will
[19:04] pass away I think all the bad things
[19:06] will but you know what
[19:08] we will not forget what we've done down
[19:11] here I don't I don't see why we're going
[19:13] to go over there and just what we're
[19:15] going to have to think about and talk
[19:16] about it and do an act
[19:30] there was a man that came along and I
[19:33] asked him how he was and he said well
[19:34] and that's good
[19:36] so I thought well I'm not gonna give him
[19:38] any money because I don't know who he is
[19:40] you know and I was kind of in a hurry so
[19:42] I went on the in-store got the card
[19:45] so I went and I bought him some crackers
[19:47] and I bought him some tuna and some Vina
[19:50] sausage and then I got a banana I'll get
[19:52] a banana for me but then when I got back
[19:55] after the curves Don came up and he was
[19:58] ready to go well when I come out of
[20:00] Quality Foods I couldn't find any so I
[20:02] said well you know I'll just take it
[20:04] home I'll give it to somebody else or
[20:05] something so I went Donna came and got
[20:08] me and I said drive through the parking
[20:10] lot just the same time
[20:12] so we drove this parking lot and he went
[20:15] in there and said Don I said well I
[20:16] think I saw him walking down the road so
[20:18] we get to the red light right there at
[20:19] the lot sure enough he was walking
[20:21] around so Donna said what do you want to
[20:23] go go give it to him I said yeah I
[20:25] bought it foreign
[20:34] one Sunday we left here from church went
[20:37] over to feed the cats a good shot of a
[20:40] man on I had stolen a tractor drunk
[20:45] driving had turned the corner there and
[20:48] wiped out about five to seven of our
[20:50] cars one of them we had just got back
[20:53] from the body shop this was the place I
[20:58] told God I said that was the guy that
[21:00] wiped out all our cars on that stolen
[21:02] tractor that we did because we caught
[21:06] him
[21:07] potential violated he went to jail we
[21:10] got enough the insurance wouldn't pay
[21:12] for the parts and that guy sold track
[21:15] yeah we had no recourse
[21:36] and you'll see how hungry they are right
[21:39] so there's wisdom to use that don't just
[21:41] be don't give up every dime you got I
[21:44] mean we're Christian and we're supposed
[21:45] to act like Christians and they'll
[21:46] probably call you an antichrist for not
[21:48] doing it but you don't know
[21:52] you just got to be letting the Lord you
[21:54] just the best thing to do is just say
[21:55] hey buddy come on I'll get you
[21:58] uh I'll buy you ten dollars worth of you
[22:00] don't know you hand them ten dollars
[22:01] they'll probably go get drunk and hit
[22:02] somebody and kill them you know you
[22:04] never know the best thing to do is we
[22:06] did that one time in Thompson Georgia we
[22:09] were going to June's dad at McDonald's
[22:10] the guy said my wife down here on the
[22:12] side of the road and I need twenty
[22:13] dollars for gas
[22:15] and I was getting ready to give me
[22:16] twenty dollars and I said hey
[22:19] I'll help you I said I'll get a gas can
[22:21] and I've got my car here and Jim's
[22:22] inside was doing something and I said
[22:25] well I'll just drive you no no that's
[22:27] okay man I just need the $20 to get my
[22:29] gas with and I'm like okay
[22:32] I said I'll meet you down there
[22:35] and I said I'll just meet you I said
[22:37] where's it at I know Thompson I know
[22:39] where the highway goes I said I'll just
[22:40] is she on the side of the road over
[22:42] there oh that's okay man don't worry
[22:43] about it I'll get it from somebody else
[22:45] yeah so I mean like I said 10 minutes
[22:47] later he was hustling somebody else so
[22:50] when Don gives somebody money yeah
[23:03] going back to what you said about you
[23:04] never know who's watching this ladies we
[23:08] stand out more now than any other age
[23:10] all these mini skirts
[23:14] everybody's watching us because we look
[23:17] different when you do something yeah not
[23:20] right yes
[23:22] well it doesn't match the profession
[23:25] that you have on it doesn't match the
[23:26] fruit that's on the tree the fruit right
[23:29] you know the direct long dress yeah
[23:31] that's why you have to be careful and
[23:34] even being careful
[23:36] not everybody's got on a long dress and
[23:38] got long hair some I just like some
[23:39] people just like long dresses and long
[23:41] hair but you gotta you that's why this
[23:43] is the Plus
[23:44] to me these are pluses you got the Holy
[23:47] Ghost you got the new birth you're
[23:49] you're just as Eternal as God is God
[23:51] still speaks to you God still speaks
[23:53] through you God still does things for
[23:55] you but he wants to add he says add to
[23:58] that's a plus add to your faith virtue
[24:02] add to your virtue knowledge you
[24:05] understand what I'm saying so it's an ad
[24:06] these are attitudes
[24:08] right okay these are not just
[24:11] Elementary now Elementary's good
[24:16] at least you're in Chicago yeah but why
[24:19] would you want to be 40 years old and
[24:20] still be in first grade
[24:22] you know have a beard in the fourth
[24:24] grade you know well see
[24:26] you know there was something wrong well
[24:29] then people would know something's wrong
[24:31] spiritually mentally you understand what
[24:33] I mean with your spiritual mentality not
[24:35] your natural mentality if you've if
[24:37] you've been born again for 20 years and
[24:39] you still got the same old problems we
[24:41] got to start shedding these that's why
[24:43] that pyramid's in an angle
[24:46] and the angle goes away not toward
[24:49] everybody got that yeah you see what I'm
[24:51] saying run around and said one time he
[24:53] said we are on a knife blade Edge
[24:56] he said an ax blade actually you know
[24:59] you turn an ax blade up like this that
[25:01] blade goes right up to nothing if it's
[25:03] real sharp if a knife's real sharp you
[25:05] can't hardly see the end of it or the
[25:07] edge that's what we're on he said if you
[25:10] fall off one way or the other he said
[25:12] there's no way
[25:15] that you come back he said you got to
[25:17] come back up to the middle
[25:19] right that's right because what is that
[25:22] angle
[25:24] falling away so what that was doing in
[25:27] Sister Shepard's dream it wasn't here I
[25:29] was doing it brother Berlin I thought it
[25:30] was here but Ginger Shepherd's green
[25:32] that was the pyramid and brother random
[25:34] had pulled the top off of it or the man
[25:37] did and that the man had to be by the
[25:39] brown because he said it was a messenger
[25:40] and he was pouring water in the word and
[25:44] then water was coming out over the top
[25:46] of that pyramid and flowing down the
[25:48] sides and he said it was trash so this
[25:51] is all getting rid of trash
[25:52] all right up and out
[25:55] up and out all right
[25:57] and then what happens then then what
[26:00] does God do he takes a meat
[26:02] sealed that baby up with the Holy Spirit
[26:04] seals you all the way in
[26:07] not that you won't ever get no more
[26:08] virtue but you'll come to a place that's
[26:10] what I said God knows how much virtue
[26:12] you need
[26:14] you don't
[26:16] right you just don't know
[26:19] you just got to keep getting it that's
[26:21] right Silver and Gold Have I not now if
[26:24] that didn't just drain Peter and he was
[26:26] done for his rest of his life no that
[26:27] was probably just the beginning
[26:29] because remember the book of Acts done
[26:31] many many words okay so that's what we
[26:34] need these are pluses they're additions
[26:36] too that's just like Jonas he's a human
[26:41] but there's additions too he's going to
[26:44] add human knowledge
[26:47] right he's going to add these human
[26:50] things but he's a human
[26:52] but he's going to add these character
[26:54] builders
[26:55] during his life to where he's not going
[26:57] to sit well he may sit in his mom's left
[26:59] and leave about 20. the way he's going
[27:00] now
[27:01] but one day mom was going out to kick
[27:04] him out and say buddy you got to stand
[27:06] up on yourself and you need to feed
[27:07] yourself being 20 years old and shaving
[27:09] you need to go feed yourself
[27:10] all right but see that's abnormal
[27:13] but normal people want
[27:18] that word leave and cleave you know they
[27:20] get it backwards nowadays the Bible says
[27:22] leave your mother and father and cleave
[27:24] to your spouse not leave your spouse and
[27:26] cleave to your father mother
[27:28] I can see where they the Lord added
[27:32] those things
[27:35] you need a strength well that's what
[27:39] we're going to talk about once we get
[27:40] off of the Holy Ghost we're going to get
[27:41] into that
[27:42] because it is an addition to your new
[27:46] birth
[27:47] it's in there
[27:49] but you got to see it in there right
[27:52] right because see you can you can like
[27:54] brother Brown said you you get the Holy
[27:56] Ghost you got everything you need for
[27:57] the rest of your life
[27:58] whenever he quit preaching when he got
[28:00] the new bar
[28:01] did he quit acting like a question did
[28:03] he quit doing I mean he should have the
[28:05] way that says he's got everything he
[28:06] needs for the rest of his life he ought
[28:08] to just lay back under a tree you know
[28:09] and just take a nap
[28:11] no that's when you really know how to
[28:13] use what you got right
[28:15] Jonas has got hands arms feet and all
[28:17] that I mean his arms hearing his stuff
[28:20] he don't know what to do he's doing with
[28:22] it but he's got it
[28:24] he don't know what to do with his hands
[28:25] but one day maybe he'll be a skilled
[28:27] labor and he'll be able to take those
[28:29] hands he can't hardly pick up a spoon
[28:31] now
[28:32] and be able to make a rocket out of it
[28:35] but it's because of not what he's got
[28:38] but what's added to what he's got that's
[28:42] the same way with you and I it's an add
[28:44] two looks like brother Brown said here
[28:45] that's how we know we've passed from
[28:48] Death unto life we look back to the pit
[28:51] where we were hewed from all right so he
[28:54] said oh it's bad to look back when our
[28:56] brother Brown said look back
[28:58] it's not bad to look back it's it's bad
[29:00] to turn and go back all right it's not
[29:03] bad to look back and say hey God you've
[29:05] brought me through this right here and
[29:06] it had to be you
[29:08] but but to go back into the pit
[29:10] different scoring all right we're not
[29:12] what we want to be we're not even what
[29:15] we ought to be right but one thing we're
[29:17] thankful for we're not what we used to
[29:19] be right that was the old color sister
[29:21] that said that now it's a very profound
[29:23] statement now look at the next thing he
[29:25] says we're on the road
[29:29] being born again put you on the highway
[29:31] puts you on the road
[29:33] all right now what you got to do is is
[29:36] you've got to make the preparation to go
[29:40] either walking or driving you make the
[29:43] choice you can either go real fast or
[29:45] you can go real slow but at least you're
[29:47] going and you're on the right road right
[29:48] now you can go from here to California
[29:51] but if New York's where you were going
[29:53] you're in bad shape you got on the wrong
[29:55] road somewhere but if you get on the
[29:57] right Road
[29:58] you'll get there
[30:00] and having escaped the corruption of the
[30:02] world having escaped that the lust and
[30:04] Corruption of the world you're above
[30:06] that
[30:08] now that's the type of person that he's
[30:09] talking to the person that has escaped
[30:12] these things seen the corruption of the
[30:14] world all right let's continue
[30:18] what he's his thought right here just
[30:19] for a minute
[30:21] and having escaped the corruption of the
[30:23] world having escaped that the lust and
[30:25] Corruption of the world you're above
[30:27] that now that's now that's the type of
[30:29] person that he's talking to
[30:31] the person that has escaped these things
[30:33] see the corruption of the world besides
[30:34] this so it besides it's okay
[30:36] giving all diligence adding to your
[30:39] faith versus using diverse knowledge to
[30:41] knowledge Temperance patience patience
[30:43] regardless regardless and brother
[30:45] kindness
[30:47] charity y'all gonna have to quieten them
[30:49] babies down a little bit I'm sorry
[30:52] don't need to be disturbed while we're
[30:54] doing this
[30:55] now he was giving us the outline here
[30:57] what to do know how to do it now there
[31:00] it is know how to do it
[31:02] you don't know how
[31:04] you don't know how there's no way you
[31:07] can know how to live like God if you
[31:08] don't have a little God in you
[31:11] you can say oh look at brother Dale well
[31:14] yeah he's a good example
[31:16] but he can't make me what I am now
[31:20] listen now but through him that's right
[31:23] through him I can't right through
[31:26] brother Bob I can't through you I can
[31:31] but you can't make me that's right and
[31:34] you can live in exemplary life you can
[31:36] live a life that's just so close to God
[31:37] like brother round but look what did
[31:39] they see
[31:41] they saw him as God that's great not God
[31:44] using it that's right they saw him as
[31:47] God not God using it but if you'll see
[31:50] that God is using that funnel
[31:53] I think brother Brown had these virtues
[31:55] to be able to preach it you got to have
[31:57] them
[31:58] other than that you're just presuming
[32:00] and other than that you're just saying
[32:02] well maybe
[32:04] no faith virtue knowledge Temperance
[32:07] patience godliness brotherly kindness
[32:09] that are additions to what you already
[32:12] have
[32:14] okay so now list what he says that's why
[32:17] I chose this message this morning for
[32:19] the church knowing that people are
[32:20] traveling for last night I sit here and
[32:22] he's out of town about 90 what he's
[32:24] saying is the people are coming in and
[32:26] not the people that are there at the
[32:27] Tabernacle see they're all common people
[32:30] poor ordinary dress there's no great
[32:31] Anthem he's telling the people
[32:35] no great anthem from some pretend to be
[32:37] Angelic choir pop organs and some
[32:39] stained glass windows you have a hard
[32:40] time getting to see it on the bench they
[32:42] don't come for such as that
[32:44] but they come because inside of them
[32:47] say is something that sees a beauty
[32:51] that the natural eye doesn't see
[32:53] it's a spiritual eye that catches the
[32:56] beauty of Christ okay now what happens
[32:59] is in life and we'll get to understand
[33:01] I'm gonna try to finish at 10 30. is
[33:04] that we are going to be able to
[33:08] come to a place to where not everybody's
[33:11] going to go oh they're just so fearsome
[33:14] now that we've got to come to a place to
[33:16] where that
[33:17] you know when brother Brandon walked
[33:19] into a room
[33:22] the room changed right right atmosphere
[33:25] chain but you said oh it was the prophet
[33:28] now what about that time he walks into
[33:29] the house
[33:31] he tells the story kids are screaming
[33:34] that's right right now this is the
[33:37] Prophet this is Dr we ain't talking
[33:38] about some being out and healing the
[33:40] scent raising the dead he's just a man
[33:43] he's at home
[33:44] he's not got this great anointing on him
[33:47] you may not think
[33:49] but he walks into a room and there's
[33:52] just chaos in the house
[33:54] well you know what if he didn't have a
[33:57] little bit of these virtues he would
[33:58] have started screaming
[34:00] like sometimes we do he would have
[34:02] started
[34:04] why screaming at his wife
[34:06] because it's her problem she's the
[34:08] problem
[34:09] and the kids
[34:11] smack them on send them to bed
[34:14] what'd he do
[34:16] he walks in he doesn't say a word he
[34:18] puts on an apron
[34:20] he goes over and he says honey let me
[34:22] help you
[34:25] with dinner or dishes or whatever he was
[34:27] doing and he what'd he say he said now
[34:29] he didn't say instantly
[34:31] I believe he said five or ten minutes
[34:33] somewhere in the he said either like 10
[34:35] minutes later he said the kids were
[34:37] playing in the in the room he said the
[34:39] wife was real happy and I was helping
[34:41] her make dinner and everything just
[34:42] after 10 minutes so it's not an
[34:45] instantaneous thing but what did he do
[34:46] he had virtue he created an atmosphere
[34:50] he created an atmosphere but he had
[34:52] enough knowledge
[34:55] to know not to do certain things
[34:58] plenty of temperance
[35:00] because he controlled his temper
[35:02] right
[35:04] and a big Gob of patience
[35:08] to be patient with all that going on
[35:12] because a lot of times we'll jump in the
[35:13] middle of something going we all been
[35:15] guilty of this we'll jump in something
[35:17] make it worse that's right
[35:20] I told Donnie I'll tell him that Susan
[35:23] tell him too Donnie if something was
[35:25] going on at work and Donnie would just
[35:27] walk right in the middle of it and make
[35:28] it 10 times worse
[35:31] the before and the after he just walks
[35:33] in and gets involved that you you don't
[35:35] need to do that I've told him that so I
[35:38] mean nothing not he don't know that I
[35:41] know of it okay do what he's trying to
[35:43] think he's just trying to fix it but you
[35:45] can't fix something that you don't know
[35:47] nothing about
[35:48] okay
[35:50] you just can't go in and go brother Ryan
[35:53] didn't go in and go
[36:04] maybe a little bit of temper you know
[36:06] remember what she done slammed the
[36:07] doorstep that's okay but remember
[36:12] he assessed the situation
[36:14] and I believe God took over I believe he
[36:16] had an anointing
[36:17] not just being a husband father man of
[36:21] the house and all this stuff
[36:22] right right he just took over what was
[36:26] then he took over what was in him raised
[36:28] up and took over now that's what we need
[36:30] because when the water goes in we feel
[36:32] we'll read next Sunday we'll read sister
[36:34] Shepard's dream that water that he was
[36:37] pouring in was pure
[36:39] but when it come out it had trash and I
[36:41] didn't make the water trashy it was just
[36:43] getting the trash out of what was inside
[36:45] that vessel remember then he put honey
[36:47] in it
[36:49] and poured water back in it and it held
[36:51] the water
[36:54] okay brother Brown that's why that holy
[36:56] spirit's up there at the top that's not
[36:58] the Holy Spirit at the bottom you might
[36:59] not have a lot of honey when you got the
[37:00] Holy Spirit at the bottom
[37:02] yeah
[37:04] right God you still gotta have faith
[37:07] still gotta have better you still gotta
[37:09] have mileage still gotta have temper but
[37:11] when you get up there where it says holy
[37:12] spirit above the brotherly kindness
[37:14] that's when the Honey comes in now buddy
[37:16] well I'm telling you about some honey
[37:17] honey is pure there's no way you can
[37:20] duplicate honey there's no way honey is
[37:23] twice as sweet as sugar
[37:26] honey is so pure they don't even they
[37:28] can't even duplicate it
[37:30] and that's what why do you think you use
[37:32] honey read the Bible what brother Brown
[37:34] and what brother Brown says about honey
[37:35] and the honeycomb
[37:37] because that's what the scripture says
[37:38] sweeter than honey and the honeycomb
[37:40] will fish sweeter than honey
[37:42] 's two times sweeter than pure sugar
[37:47] man you can get bathed in it
[37:52] he said that box finally held water what
[37:54] what was going in see sometimes the
[37:57] water the word goes in and it goes out
[37:58] yes it don't reside that's right okay
[38:02] what he was talking about then and when
[38:04] he said the man poured the water in the
[38:05] box and the Box held the water so we're
[38:09] going to come to a point in time I
[38:10] believe to where what we hear is going
[38:13] to absolutely right there and make an
[38:14] effect on us now it takes a long time
[38:16] come on people yeah right we've been
[38:19] here 20 30 years it takes a long time
[38:21] for the word to take effect on us now
[38:23] why
[38:25] we don't have all them working that's
[38:26] true when we have all them working in
[38:28] our life the honey
[38:32] the honey seals it in and what we get is
[38:35] going to do us
[38:36] more than sugar more than honey because
[38:39] it's sweeter than honey and the
[38:41] honeycomb so it's just going to be the
[38:42] words going to be much more sweeter to
[38:44] us
[38:45] we're still going to have cares of life
[38:47] still gonna have problems don't think
[38:49] you'll ever be problemless even if
[38:51] you're up there
[38:52] in the top of the pyramid you're still
[38:54] going to have life problems life issues
[38:57] life you know why you have a lot of
[38:58] issues because you can't control
[38:59] everybody that's right okay but remember
[39:03] when we get there everybody's going to
[39:05] be that
[39:07] so then what you don't have that devil
[39:11] playing with you so much
[39:13] because the devil's playing with you all
[39:14] the time now whether you whether you're
[39:16] a manifested Son of God adopted into the
[39:19] family of God Jesus got killed when he
[39:21] was an adopted son of God
[39:24] brother Brown had real bad problems when
[39:27] he got adopted and started preaching the
[39:29] uh the seals thousands of his friends
[39:32] left him he was standing virtually by
[39:34] himself just like the Lord Jesus did so
[39:37] being adopted is not going to be this
[39:38] you're going to walk into a hospital and
[39:40] everybody's just going to start jumping
[39:42] up
[39:43] but you know what they say it's when
[39:44] brother Branham died in the emergency
[39:46] room
[39:47] when they put him in that emergency room
[39:49] every person every patient in that
[39:52] emergency room got better
[39:54] he never prayed and he was just his
[39:56] presence well see that's what you want
[39:58] you want that presence of God so much to
[40:00] wear to where you don't have to uh like
[40:02] I said Peter didn't have to go look up
[40:04] in a quote book Peter didn't have to go
[40:06] over and get a Bible and read one I need
[40:09] to have a person no it was a natural
[40:11] occurring thing and when they put
[40:13] brother Branham even even the body of
[40:16] William Branham was dying that soul and
[40:19] that Spirit of that man
[40:20] had so much of God in him till it just
[40:23] flowed out
[40:24] and him being in that emergency room
[40:26] they said it cleared the whole emergency
[40:27] room when he was there now he died
[40:31] but the spirit that was in him
[40:34] was so much use of that man until
[40:37] everybody in the emergency room got
[40:39] better and that's a documented fact now
[40:41] the whole Hospital didn't get emptied
[40:43] out but right there around where he was
[40:47] you see what I'm saying they see the
[40:48] power that God can give you without you
[40:51] having power that's right
[40:53] because power without character satanic
[40:55] that's why these virtues are character
[40:58] you can have Satan has power
[41:01] yeah right but he doesn't have character
[41:04] he can't act like God I mean he can act
[41:06] like God but he can't be God and you and
[41:08] I got to come to place where we are God
[41:09] made manifest in another form made
[41:12] manifest in another form if you keep
[41:13] that right all right
[41:15] next Sunday we'll work on we'll look at
[41:17] sister Shepard's dream and see um see
[41:20] what was going on with that
[41:34] you have to move
[41:39] well yeah
[41:42] yeah
[41:54] some people ain't gonna care how you
[41:56] acting it's got to be for you you've got
[41:58] to realize that when I used to do stuff
[42:00] like that
