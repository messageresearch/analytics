[9:22] weekend she's going to get me
[9:26] later oh
[9:30] no well we we
[9:32] anyway we'll leave that for
[9:36] later but uh it it was a good weekend
[9:40] good good time with the Believers up
[9:41] there and just a precious group up there
[9:43] in in Indiana and so tonight we're going
[9:45] to take a little scripture from Hebrews
[9:47] chapter 1 and Genesis 1 and just take a
[9:51] little topic um not one word off cuz
[9:54] that's what we God wants us to
[9:56] be let's bow our heads Lord God we're so
[9:59] grateful to be able to gather around
[10:01] your word tonight Lord Jesus and we just
[10:03] Lord want to invite you in Lord God to
[10:04] take these words off the page and
[10:06] Quicken them to us Lord God and give us
[10:08] exactly what we have need of and Lord
[10:10] looking around the room Lord you know
[10:12] every need Lord Jesus Lord I don't I
[10:14] don't know what's buried down in the
[10:15] heart of the different s men and women
[10:18] that are gathered here get today Lord
[10:19] but you know Lord and you know exactly
[10:21] what they have need of and we've got a
[10:23] promise laying in your word that the
[10:24] word is still a discerner of the
[10:26] thoughts and intents of the Heart Lord
[10:27] Jesus you can let it go out and just lay
[10:29] right in the good ground and and begin
[10:31] to draw and and and and minister to
[10:34] exactly what the needs are Lord and we
[10:35] just ask that tonight Lord Jesus that
[10:37] you'll just be with us and feel at
[10:38] Liberty to to be with us and come and
[10:41] stir up our hearts tonight we pray in
[10:43] your name
[10:46] amen now Hebrews chapter 1 verse one if
[10:49] we'll start with that and it says and
[10:50] then we'll go to Genesis 1 it's Hebrews
[10:53] 1 says God who at Sury
[10:56] times and in diverse manners spake in
[11:00] time passed unto the fathers by the
[11:02] prophets hath in these last days spoken
[11:05] unto us by his son whom he hath
[11:07] appointed heir of All Things by whom
[11:10] also he made the worlds who being the
[11:13] brightness of his glory and the express
[11:16] image of his person now there's there's
[11:18] the part to kind of hang on to the
[11:20] express image of his person and
[11:23] upholding All Things by the word of his
[11:25] power when he had by himself purged our
[11:27] sins said sat down on the right hand of
[11:30] the Majesty on high and so that's
[11:33] speaking of Christ and then we'll go
[11:35] over to Genesis
[11:37] 1:26 that says and God said let us make
[11:40] man in our image after our likeness and
[11:44] let them have dominion over the fish of
[11:47] the sea and over the fowl of the air and
[11:49] over the cattle and over all the Earth
[11:52] and over every creeping thing that
[11:53] creepeth upon the earth now you think
[11:55] about what a promise that is to have
[11:58] dominion over every everything that's
[12:00] what the Bible
[12:02] says so God created man in his own image
[12:06] in the image now see how that ties
[12:08] together with Hebrews 1 Christ is the
[12:11] express image of his person now so God
[12:14] created man in his own image Amen in the
[12:17] image of God created he him male and
[12:21] female created he them you may be seated
[12:24] the Lord at his Blessing to the reading
[12:25] of the
[12:27] word now we'll just kind of tonight uh I
[12:32] just want to kind of just maybe talk and
[12:34] of course some I know how sometimes I'll
[12:36] say that I'll talk I just want to talk
[12:37] and then here we go
[12:41] but I just want to talk about some
[12:44] things and uh that are laying here in
[12:46] the scripture and you you think about
[12:48] what it's saying there that Christ is
[12:49] the express image when he was walking on
[12:52] the shore of Galilee if you want to know
[12:54] if you want to talk to God you can walk
[12:57] up to him and talk to him but then then
[13:00] then uh and of course they didn't
[13:01] recognize him they said if show us the
[13:03] father and it sufficeth and all those
[13:05] things and he's like I've been have you
[13:07] been with you all this time and you
[13:08] didn't recognize it in other words he
[13:09] was he was God on display where they
[13:12] could imagine that to be able to walk up
[13:14] to God and give him a hug talk to him
[13:17] and listen to him but now on the day of
[13:20] Pentecost he took that same Essence the
[13:23] same life and put it inside Believers to
[13:26] fulfill what's written in here in
[13:28] Genesis 26 27 that that you and I would
[13:33] also be the express image of God that
[13:36] God could take his own life and put it
[13:39] inside of a Believer and they would be
[13:41] the expression of Christ on display amen
[13:45] now you you think about how how maybe
[13:47] strange that is that because there's a
[13:49] lot of fake out there there's a lot of
[13:52] nonsense out there there's a lot of
[13:53] things like that that get people off the
[13:55] track and you look at you people people
[14:00] get you know confused about things how
[14:03] things work but there's the promise L
[14:05] here that you and I can be the express
[14:08] image the express image of God God on
[14:11] display where you can what does that
[14:13] mean that you can be just as kind as
[14:15] Christ just as patient as Christ that's
[14:19] what these attributes that we got on the
[14:20] board behind us just as virtuous as
[14:24] Christ that you can think like Christ
[14:27] that you can be one with Christ God
[14:30] wants us to be completely United with
[14:34] him amen now you think now just kind of
[14:36] laying out the pattern down through down
[14:38] through the last 2,000 years it's like
[14:41] the word has been just growing and
[14:43] growing and growing where you know down
[14:45] in the Dark Ages they they were just
[14:47] putting everything on the Catholic
[14:49] system and the way that things were that
[14:51] that you had to come to a priest and
[14:53] confess things and whatnot and then
[14:54] Martin Luther came with it uh that you
[14:57] know he began to preach that we're just
[14:59] we're justified by faith not not because
[15:02] we confess to a man or anything like
[15:04] that but because because we believe on
[15:06] the Lord Jesus Christ and the word kept
[15:08] growing and growing and then John Wesley
[15:11] John Wesley began to preach that we we
[15:13] ain't going to live like the devil if
[15:15] we're we're Christians we're going to
[15:17] we're going to be Sanctified and we're
[15:18] going to be set apart we're actually
[15:20] going to fulfill the things like like in
[15:22] Ezekiel 44 that says that we're supposed
[15:25] to be not God's going to separate the
[15:27] the profane from the holy
[15:29] the profane and the holy got to be
[15:30] separated and that's what John Wesley
[15:32] was preaching that we're going to be
[15:34] we're going to be clean even to the
[15:35] point where John Wesley wouldn't drink
[15:37] uh coffee or tea because he was like if
[15:39] it doesn't have any profit to me we're
[15:41] we're we're not going to do anything
[15:42] with it because he was I want to be
[15:44] separated he wanted to be separated and
[15:47] and the word just kept growing and
[15:48] growing of the day uh on isusa Street
[15:50] the Holy Ghost fell on the on Aza Street
[15:53] back in 1906 to to show that God was
[15:58] he's growing it's it's it's like the
[15:59] word is growing that um more word is
[16:02] being given to actually restore the
[16:04] signs and wonders and the gifts and
[16:06] things in the church and it just keeps
[16:08] growing and growing and unfolding why
[16:10] because God wants to God wants us to
[16:12] bring us to a place where there's no
[16:14] there's no hindrance to the spirit
[16:16] moving there's no hindrance to the way
[16:18] that you think about the word that you
[16:20] can actually believe for all that all
[16:23] things are possible why why are these
[16:27] why is it so because there in Genesis
[16:29] 12627 God created us to have dominion
[16:34] over the fish of the sea and over the
[16:36] foul of the air and over the cattle and
[16:38] over all the earth now isn't that why
[16:40] even in your own natural self you you
[16:43] like my wife loves the little chickens
[16:45] she loves the rabbits there's just
[16:46] something in you you want to you want to
[16:48] take care of the little dog you want to
[16:50] take care of it you want to take you
[16:51] want to you want to help the cattle in
[16:53] the middle of the night when they're
[16:54] delivering the little calf you want to
[16:55] go out there cuz there's something
[16:57] within you you want to help thing now of
[16:58] course man in this Fallen condition they
[17:01] just pollute the thing they let all
[17:03] their they they pollute the water and
[17:05] pollute the ocean and and and and just
[17:08] fish everything out until there's um
[17:10] having to worry about uh you know no
[17:13] more no more salmon and no more all this
[17:15] in the ocean and and everything just
[17:17] goes Haywire because what that because
[17:20] sin entered the picture but the way that
[17:22] the picture that God had for us from the
[17:24] very beginning was for there to be peace
[17:28] and Harmony Harmony in your mind
[17:31] happiness and joy and and just Union
[17:34] with God that's the the picture that God
[17:36] wants us to be God don't want you to be
[17:38] all depressed and he don't want you to
[17:40] be in a situation where you just you you
[17:42] have no purpose in your life oh that's
[17:44] what this gospel is for to take you from
[17:46] a place where there's just confusion and
[17:48] Chaos in your life and all you're doing
[17:50] is just coming home at night and sitting
[17:52] there on the couch with a beer or
[17:54] whatever and and take you from that
[17:55] place where you have no purpose and
[17:57] bring you to a place where God has makes
[17:59] you holy where you can be a witness to
[18:01] somebody else uh that's going through
[18:03] some rough times and be speak a word of
[18:05] encouragement to them oh I I thank God
[18:08] that that's what the gospel is that you
[18:09] can you can be Christ on display and not
[18:13] just by some intellectual thing where I
[18:15] got to be Christ on this play but
[18:17] actually Christ Living in you his life
[18:20] the very essence of his being the same
[18:22] the same life in you that was in Christ
[18:25] that's what the Holy Ghost is that's
[18:27] what your purpose is
[18:29] in Ephesians 2: 13 and 14 says but now
[18:32] in Christ Jesus ye who sometimes were
[18:36] far off are made nigh by the blood of
[18:39] Christ now that's what the blood of
[18:41] Christ does to take you that were far
[18:43] off and bring you into Union with God
[18:47] for he is our peace who hath made both
[18:51] one and ha broken down the middle wall
[18:55] of partition between us
[18:58] now to think to think tonight that down
[19:01] in sin and and and the the situation
[19:04] that that the fall put you in that that
[19:05] was a wall between you and God and God
[19:08] come and died on the cross to tear that
[19:10] wall down to tear that wall down and
[19:12] begin to bring you together so so that
[19:16] it's it's it's really difficult to tell
[19:19] where the line is if you think like God
[19:21] and and you believe all things are
[19:23] possible and you're living like God and
[19:25] you're walking like God and you can
[19:26] speak a word of encouragement to some
[19:28] somebody else even when when somebody's
[19:30] going through a bad time and you can you
[19:31] can speak a word that will make them
[19:33] want the gospel and you can tell them
[19:36] something that will make them something
[19:38] begin to pulsate in their heart see
[19:41] that's God on display and you can speak
[19:44] something that will that will make them
[19:45] realize that God does care about me and
[19:48] that's what I want to speak to you
[19:50] tonight to remind you that God does care
[19:52] about you no matter what situation
[19:54] you're in maybe the the wall is still up
[19:58] where where you think that you think
[19:59] there's a gap between you and God I I I
[20:02] I want to preach a word tonight that to
[20:05] make you realize that God cared enough
[20:07] for you to come down and die for you to
[20:09] tear down that middle wall of partition
[20:12] to bring you into fellowship with Christ
[20:16] to bring you back into Oneness with him
[20:18] so that you can have real communion with
[20:20] God now now that is what is what is
[20:23] Oneness what is Oneness is Unity Unity
[20:26] where there's no there's no line of
[20:29] division there's no Gap there's it's
[20:32] it's Unity Oneness is a it's like a
[20:34] profound Spiritual Awakening it's it's
[20:38] where you begin to you begin to wonder
[20:40] where is the light where is that middle
[20:42] wall of petition where is the line drawn
[20:45] and and so you you think about the
[20:48] Oneness of God Oneness the Oneness of
[20:51] God the Oneness in God
[20:54] means that that there is one God Oneness
[20:57] in Christ Christ the unity of the Bride
[21:01] the mystical Union of the Bride In
[21:04] Christ all those it's all coming
[21:06] together in one now of course now the
[21:09] devil's got his idea of un unity in
[21:13] Genesis 11:6 it says and the Lord said
[21:15] behold the people is one and they have
[21:18] all one language and this they begin to
[21:19] do and now nothing will be restrained
[21:21] from them which they imagined to do they
[21:24] they got all together and they started
[21:26] building this Tower of Babel
[21:29] which is like uh that's where Babylon
[21:31] began from and bab Babylon all that is a
[21:34] is a symbol of Satan's confusion that he
[21:37] brings and there at that Tower of Babel
[21:39] they just got they were United but there
[21:42] they got confused and they began to God
[21:45] confused their allow them to start
[21:47] speaking different different languages
[21:50] now see the devil's got a plan to bring
[21:52] Oneness that that I don't want and
[21:55] that's to unite us together outside of
[21:57] the the word you see that word is
[22:01] everything to us God wants us to not be
[22:04] one word off now you think you think
[22:06] about that tonight how can you how can
[22:08] you walk together if you don't agree how
[22:11] can you walk with God if you don't agree
[22:12] on things how can you walk with your
[22:14] spouse if you don't agree I I was
[22:17] actually reading this morning I just saw
[22:18] it pop up on my news little thing on my
[22:21] on my phone that that uh spouses that
[22:24] come together if they don't agree on how
[22:27] to raise their children if they don't
[22:29] agree on finances if they don't agree on
[22:31] anything just in the natural it's not
[22:33] going to be long before they're going to
[22:35] separate because they just can't they
[22:37] just can't live together you you're
[22:39] going to before long it's going to Stew
[22:41] up into a great big argument and you
[22:44] won't be able to you won't be able to
[22:46] keep see a even a good marriage just in
[22:49] the natural is going to be started on
[22:50] agreeing on things agreeing on what your
[22:53] faith is agreeing on how to uh do your
[22:56] bank account agreeing on on different
[22:58] things because the Bible says how can
[23:00] you walk together if you don't agreem
[23:03] amen and God is a plan and the devil has
[23:07] a plan and and then the devil is trying
[23:09] to get all people under his plan while
[23:12] God's trying to get people to be one
[23:14] under his plan now what's the devil's
[23:16] plan the devil's plan is just it it
[23:18] doesn't matter we just all come together
[23:20] we'll just all come together and unite
[23:21] and try to just cram everything together
[23:24] and just say it you know just ignore
[23:26] ignore the truth but God's plan is to is
[23:29] to is to unite based upon his word amen
[23:33] and now if you Unite with God you got to
[23:36] separate from the world Amen I this is
[23:39] this is something that maybe you know
[23:41] causes so much
[23:42] confusion to think
[23:46] that when you begin to unite with God
[23:50] it's going to it's going to cause
[23:52] conflict in Matthew 10: 34-36 it says do
[23:56] not think that I have come to bring
[23:57] peace to to the earth I have not come to
[24:00] bring peace but a sword amen right for I
[24:04] have come to set a man against his
[24:06] father now you think maybe in your own
[24:08] life think about the impact that this
[24:11] had when you became a Christian when you
[24:12] begin to find the truth for I have come
[24:15] to set a man against his father and a
[24:18] daughter against her mother and a
[24:21] daughter-in-law against her
[24:23] mother-in-law and a person's enemies
[24:26] will be those of his own
[24:28] household what a strange thing you think
[24:32] when you become a Christian everything
[24:33] is we're going to be unite and
[24:35] everything's just going to be hunky dory
[24:38] but but then you find out that it
[24:40] actually makes you an enemy of people a
[24:43] person's enemy will be those of his own
[24:45] household and make you enemy of the
[24:47] people that are your
[24:49] family why cuz what a strange thing that
[24:52] Unity with God will always bring
[24:56] conflict yeah right why because there's
[24:58] somebody that's trying to adhere to
[25:00] God's word trying to stay in lock step
[25:03] with the word and others around you may
[25:05] might not see things exactly the same
[25:07] way in Luke 12: 51- 53 it says do you
[25:11] think I came to bring peace on Earth
[25:13] this is Jesus talking do you think I
[25:16] came to bring peace on Earth no I tell
[25:19] you but division y right from now on
[25:22] there will be five in one family divided
[25:24] against each other three against two and
[25:26] two against three they will be divided
[25:29] father against son and son against
[25:31] father mother against daughter and
[25:32] daughter against mother mother-in-law
[25:34] against daughter-in-law and
[25:35] daughter-in-law against
[25:37] mother-in-law I was actually talking to
[25:39] a brother recently that his his father
[25:41] left the faith and and he's wondering
[25:44] you know they when something like that
[25:45] happens you're always hunting for like
[25:47] that say a Magic Bullet tell me tell me
[25:50] the thing that I can say but but there's
[25:53] the promise here every look every
[25:55] everybody is an individual
[25:58] and that's that's just the way it is
[26:01] everybody's got their own walk
[26:03] everybody's everybody's going to
[26:04] surrender or not surrender and sometimes
[26:08] it's just hard to admit that there's
[26:11] going to be a division as people go
[26:14] their own ways and accept or reject the
[26:16] truth there's going to be this conflict
[26:19] because Unity with God as we're trying
[26:22] to trying to uh trying to walk according
[26:25] to the word it's there's you can't but
[26:28] there to be for there to be
[26:31] conflict and that message marriage and
[26:33] divorce I'm just going to read one
[26:35] marriage and divorce quote brother Ram
[26:37] said we are not lutherans we're not
[26:38] Wesley neither are we Pentecostals we've
[26:40] got to be children of this age through
[26:43] the pregnancy of the word of God to
[26:44] bring forth a child of this age the seed
[26:47] child he went right on revealing his
[26:49] word to the body and vindicating him
[26:51] saying by himself his children begin to
[26:53] kind of look more like him because it's
[26:56] fully maturing or they become children
[26:59] of the word not children of the church
[27:01] Children of the word and the bride will
[27:03] be a lovely little lady of the word amen
[27:07] unadulterated not touched by any man's
[27:10] organization any man-made Theory she'll
[27:13] be purely
[27:15] unadulterated Bride of the word oh you
[27:18] think that now that God is going to have
[27:20] a bride a bride that that uh that is not
[27:25] touched by any any of man's ideas is any
[27:28] man's thoughts about how things should
[27:31] be she's going to be a a bride that is
[27:34] not one word off now you think about one
[27:38] not one word off is the word is maturing
[27:40] and maturing until it comes finally
[27:41] comes to a grain and you're like okay we
[27:44] got the word but brother Ram said it's
[27:46] got there's on that on that stock of
[27:48] wheat it's got to mature and what's
[27:51] happening as it's maturing it's actually
[27:54] coming out to be expressed in your life
[27:57] oh think about what's happening is it is
[27:59] it you you come you struggle and you
[28:01] struggle and you're striving and to to
[28:03] study these things out and come to a
[28:05] place of maturity and then you you you
[28:08] it it matures and matures until it's on
[28:10] that wheat stock right there the the
[28:12] corn but now brother brandom laid it out
[28:15] like this it's got to mature and mature
[28:17] and mature until it's like bread on the
[28:21] Lord's
[28:23] table bread on the Lord's table oh now
[28:26] that's mature where it's actually living
[28:29] so all those thoughts and all those
[28:31] ideas and things that we've learned
[28:32] about become more than just an idea but
[28:34] they come an
[28:35] expression oh that's why I preach so
[28:38] much that it's got to be lived it's not
[28:40] just something that we intellectualize
[28:42] or we just learn about but it's got to
[28:44] be liveed the same kindness oh brother
[28:47] Bob we don't need kindness yes we do
[28:50] because Christ was kind we don't need
[28:52] patience oh yeah we do we need to be
[28:55] patient with one another and patient
[28:56] with God we need to be temperent
[28:59] temperent to be in control of our spirit
[29:02] to not fly off the handle when somebody
[29:04] says something wrong we need to have all
[29:06] these things these attributes in us that
[29:08] were not just things that Jesus knew
[29:11] about but things that he expressed in
[29:12] his life it's got to be expressed it's
[29:15] got to be expressed until it's like
[29:16] bread on the Lord's table sitting there
[29:19] a loaf of bread and that is perfect
[29:22] Oneness Oneness Unity with God where
[29:25] there's no difference no no no no
[29:28] difference between what Christ lived and
[29:30] What Christ manifested and what you and
[29:33] I are living and to get to that to get
[29:36] to that place it's going to take a
[29:38] perfect surrender now that's that's what
[29:41] uh you know many times you know we'll
[29:43] we'll think about Oneness as learning
[29:45] but I want to maybe shift your thought
[29:47] this tonight to surrender because it's
[29:50] surrender we can learn and learn and
[29:52] learn and And just pack in all that
[29:54] knowledge and you never surrender and
[29:56] you never come to Oneness because you
[29:58] ain't surrendered you know a lot but you
[30:00] don't surrender now you you say well
[30:02] brother Bob I've surrendered when I got
[30:04] born again well listen now in the in the
[30:07] in the in the type that of of the life
[30:10] that Jesus lived there he was in The
[30:12] Garden of Gethsemane and he had to
[30:14] surrender all of his will not my will
[30:18] not my will but thine be done now see
[30:21] it's surrender surrender to come to a
[30:23] place where everything that God wants to
[30:25] be manifest in your life
[30:27] is lived out and manifested every drop
[30:31] of goodness and Holiness can be squeezed
[30:35] out like it was there in that Garden of
[30:37] the Gethsemane oh God wants to say
[30:40] sometimes he'll bring us through the
[30:41] wine press and bring us through events
[30:43] of life and bring us through situations
[30:45] where you don't know exactly what's
[30:47] going on what's he trying to do he's
[30:49] trying to test you out and bring you to
[30:51] a place where you of total surrender
[30:55] total surrender to God oh you see when
[30:58] you get totally surrendered to God it's
[31:00] like you're in a stream it's like you're
[31:01] in a river and and God's just bringing
[31:04] you you're God is bringing you where he
[31:06] wants to bring you and then you can look
[31:08] back in your life and you can remember
[31:10] where God brought you from this church
[31:12] to this church to this church to the
[31:13] what your final destination he brought
[31:16] he's leading you he's leading you all
[31:17] through your life and as you surrender
[31:20] to him then you give him the ability to
[31:22] do something to do with your life what
[31:24] he wants you to do now there's perfect
[31:27] Oneness Perfect Harmony Harmony where
[31:31] there's you know you ever hear go listen
[31:33] to a choir where you got maybe somebody
[31:36] singing Out Of Tune and and and if you
[31:38] if you're not toned if it'll make you go
[31:42] but but a good choir a good a good
[31:45] little group of singers or whatever
[31:47] Everybody's In Harmony it just sounds
[31:49] wonderful because they're listening to
[31:52] One Another they're singing the the
[31:55] right tune they're obeying
[31:57] the the leader they're in the right beat
[32:01] every they're in the rhythm of the
[32:03] composer everything's just as it should
[32:06] be and that's Harmony that's that's the
[32:09] way that God wants us to walk in this
[32:11] word to be in the rhythm of the composer
[32:14] the rhythm of the spirit of the author
[32:16] that wrote this word and and to and to
[32:18] be to to be right in beat with what he
[32:21] wrote down on the pages of this gospel
[32:23] and brother Brandon would say now the
[32:25] first man and the first woman in the
[32:26] garden of Eden was in perfect harmony
[32:29] with
[32:30] God so much that God could come down at
[32:33] any time he desired and talk lip to ear
[32:36] with Adam and Eve now that see they
[32:38] wasen on Facebook and they wern't on
[32:40] watching Netflix and they wern't on
[32:41] their Tik Tok and they wern't they
[32:44] weren't spending all that time on the in
[32:45] politics worrying about whether Trump or
[32:47] Biden or this or that was going to they
[32:49] were they were in harmony with God's
[32:51] word they were in the
[32:53] Rhythm I I I I think so many times we
[32:56] get called up on what governor abid's
[32:58] doing in Texas or whether the buses are
[33:00] going and we get so caught up in all
[33:02] those kind of things or whether Co is
[33:04] real or not or all those kind of things
[33:07] and we get we get you get sidetracked
[33:10] away from the the real thing which is
[33:13] the word of God now brother Ram said now
[33:16] that is perfect Oneness God and His
[33:18] creation God speaking lip to ear with
[33:20] Adam and Eve and they were so perfect in
[33:24] harmony with God till they were one with
[33:26] God God God and his family was one so
[33:31] what's Oneness now Oneness is
[33:34] communication and understanding and a
[33:37] common heart what what what what
[33:40] situation did they find themselves in
[33:41] they were ready to hear anytime God
[33:45] wanted right anytime now you'll find
[33:49] you'll find really that the more time
[33:51] that you spend with God the more time
[33:53] that he'll spend with you the more time
[33:56] you spend alone Al in prayer the more
[33:58] time you meditate on the word the more
[34:01] the more it's like the Gap begins to
[34:04] close that's how Adam and Eve were they
[34:07] were ready any time for fellowship and
[34:11] communion with god well God come down in
[34:13] the cool of the evening they didn't have
[34:15] to say hold on I got to go pray up a
[34:17] little bit let me go put this magazine
[34:19] that I'm looking at under the bed let me
[34:21] go let me go put this blanket over the
[34:23] TV let me go let me go let me go hide
[34:26] all the that I'm not supposed to be
[34:28] doing let me go get everything right no
[34:29] they were ready anytime oh now that's
[34:33] that's the kind of relationship God
[34:34] wants us to have with him anytime God
[34:37] wants to talk and now come on now it
[34:40] might sound crazy to say that God speaks
[34:43] to us but I believe that when you read
[34:45] this Bible that God will speak to you
[34:47] and he will reveal himself to you not
[34:50] some kind of through some kind of
[34:51] fanciful thing like the world is make it
[34:54] h I heard from God and he told me to go
[34:57] I'm going to aliens spacecraft is going
[34:59] to come pick me up or a light beam is
[35:01] going to pick no now we're not talking
[35:03] fanciful tonight we're talking real that
[35:06] this word of God is actually actually
[35:08] the the something Supernatural happens
[35:11] when you read it and you begin to find
[35:13] out that God cares for you and so on and
[35:15] so forth they were ready for Fellowship
[35:17] they believed what he said and brother
[35:20] BR said any man in his family a correct
[35:23] good Noble obedient family is one with
[35:26] another any family and if there's
[35:28] something in the family that moves them
[35:30] apart then it's not right the family's
[35:33] broken somewhere they should all be one
[35:36] father with Mother Mother with father
[35:38] children with parent parent with
[35:40] children all in agreement and when you
[35:44] see that you'll see one lovely
[35:47] picture now you think about that tonight
[35:51] that your family is supposed to be
[35:53] peaceful you you maybe you get together
[35:56] at night play a little a little board
[35:58] game with your children or something get
[35:59] together and talk to them about their
[36:01] problems and things but your children
[36:03] are supposed to see your life and your
[36:06] wife or your husband supposed to see
[36:07] your life back and forth It's supposed
[36:11] to be a communion and communion comes
[36:13] from communication and understanding I I
[36:17] think so many of the problems today one
[36:19] of the biggest problems with communion
[36:21] in a family is they just don't
[36:23] communicate communicate you either
[36:25] communicate too much or you communicate
[36:27] too little the silent treatment is
[36:30] terrible and overcommunication is
[36:31] terrible if you just vomit out
[36:33] everything that pops into your head
[36:35] it'll be Terri what you thought that
[36:38] about me but if you don't communicate at
[36:41] all that's just as terrible if you can
[36:42] find a balance in things where
[36:45] just I've been meditating one of these
[36:47] days I'm going to preach a sermon on
[36:48] balance because there's every
[36:49] everything's got a balance Trinity and
[36:51] Oneness there's balance uh everything
[36:55] but so you're you're you're children see
[36:57] your life your friends see your life and
[36:59] your friends what are they looking at
[37:01] they're looking at your Unity with God
[37:04] your oness with God or your Oneness with
[37:07] the world your Oneness with the things
[37:09] of the world where where you where your
[37:11] heart is that's where you're that's
[37:13] where you're going to be attracted to
[37:15] but listen God wants you to have a
[37:17] peaceful home
[37:19] am that's God's perfect that's that's
[37:23] what God's purpose and brother Brown
[37:25] would say what a picture
[37:27] because the very nature of God was in
[37:29] these people and therefore what they did
[37:32] they followed just in line with God and
[37:34] Mo and God with them made them one they
[37:38] wanted to hear what he
[37:39] said they believed what he
[37:43] said they desired what he
[37:48] desired that's what one to see us they
[37:52] wanted what he wanted they believed what
[37:56] he believed believed they wanted to hear
[37:59] what he
[38:00] said what he said they wanted that the
[38:05] same nature the same mind the same
[38:10] thoughts that's what the word is
[38:12] bringing us back to amen and I'm not
[38:15] when I say that's what the word is
[38:16] bringing us back to I'm not talking
[38:18] about just some ideas and things I'm
[38:19] talking about the the the furthering
[38:21] revelation of what's laying here in the
[38:24] Bible amen like in John chapter 17
[38:28] because that's exactly what Jesus was
[38:30] praying for in John chapter 17 that we
[38:32] wouldn't be different we wouldn't be
[38:35] separated but we would be
[38:37] one now I know a lot of times you've
[38:39] heard us preach here in this church that
[38:41] Jesus was praying for you when he prayed
[38:44] that prayer in John chapter 17 so maybe
[38:46] when you go home tonight you want to
[38:48] read a good good chapter out of the
[38:50] Bible go read John chapter 17 and be
[38:53] reminded tonight that God that Jesus was
[38:56] was praying for you when he prayed his
[38:58] prayer in that chapter Jesus prayed in
[39:02] John chap 17th chapter in the 11th verse
[39:05] that the church and he would be one like
[39:08] he and the father were one that the
[39:10] church we as members of the body of
[39:13] Christ would be one together just like
[39:16] he and the father are one now isn't that
[39:18] what we just read there in Hebrews 11
[39:20] that Christ is the express image of God
[39:24] but he wants you to be you and him to be
[39:26] one just like he and God and the father
[39:28] are one what a union a Oneness that
[39:31] would be to see God and his church till
[39:34] every member is just perfectly in
[39:36] harmony with each other and God and now
[39:39] that's why in John chapter 14 it says at
[39:41] that day ye shall know that I am in my
[39:46] father and ye in me and I in you right
[39:51] amen now there's Oneness what what kind
[39:53] of Oneness Unity where the division is
[39:56] being torn down and what's tearing down
[39:59] the division word upon word precept upon
[40:04] precept is bringing you into Oneness
[40:06] with Christ where over time maybe over
[40:10] years like brother bisell set up there
[40:13] at the men's meeting he said it could
[40:14] take a lifetime over years precept upon
[40:18] precept you're bringing you're being
[40:20] brought into Oneness with God that
[40:24] starts from the new birth and ends like
[40:27] now we this might seem a little bit
[40:28] strange but we hear we believe that one
[40:31] day we are going in a Rapture amen that
[40:34] our bodies are going to be changed
[40:36] because that's what the Bible speaks of
[40:37] and and and that Paul told us in the 1
[40:40] and 2 Thessalonians and and other places
[40:43] that's the church that Jesus is coming
[40:45] for is a church that's one with him
[40:48] that's when his prayer will be answered
[40:51] that we will be one Oneness is with God
[40:54] is now you ever you ever talk to an aged
[40:58] Saint and you just get in their presence
[41:01] and it's like man I feel like I'm in the
[41:03] presence of a somebody holy I I feel
[41:06] like you know you just get it they give
[41:08] you a hug and you just feel the presence
[41:09] of the Lord all around now that's where
[41:12] that's getting to a place what kind of
[41:14] one is where where the line gets a gets
[41:17] a little bit fuzzy am I talking to just
[41:20] sister so and so or is this really an
[41:24] emissary of God is this like a little
[41:26] Messiah it that God's same life is in
[41:29] her or him and when I'm sitting on the
[41:32] on the front porch you know sipping some
[41:35] lemonade and and and talking about the
[41:38] things of God I'm not just talking to
[41:40] just some somebody but this is somebody
[41:43] that God came down and was pleased to
[41:47] dwell in them that was that God come
[41:50] down and was pleased to dwell in them
[41:51] his own life is on
[41:53] display now this is a quote qu that's
[41:56] kind of shocking to some people but
[41:58] somebody you know because in brother
[42:00] bram's life if you don't know his life
[42:02] so many miraculous things happened the
[42:04] pillar of fire was visible on displ and
[42:07] this and his and several photographs and
[42:09] many many many miracles were done in his
[42:12] life to the point where some people got
[42:14] it in their head that he was God and
[42:17] brother randam in one place he said I'm
[42:19] not even going to preach anymore if
[42:21] y'all don't stop believing that but but
[42:23] the line got a little bit fuzzy to
[42:25] people now listen I'm I'm trying to make
[42:27] a point here brother Bram said he said
[42:29] people are saying brother brandom is
[42:31] more than a man he can create and Jesus
[42:34] can look just like brother brandom he
[42:36] said now let me the person said this
[42:37] whoever it might be I don't know but I'm
[42:39] your brother I'm your brother I'm just
[42:42] your brother see Jesus is your savior I
[42:44] cannot be your savior for he has already
[42:47] saved you now you're so close to being
[42:49] the truth there and yet so far from the
[42:52] truth the person that told this person
[42:54] this now listen of the way he explains
[42:57] this because you think he's talking
[42:59] about himself but he's talking about you
[43:01] amen he's talking about you he said one
[43:03] sense of the word that's exactly the
[43:06] truth another sense of the word is an
[43:10] antichrist there's another example where
[43:12] we need balance because the truth is
[43:14] always between two
[43:16] extremes one another sense of the word
[43:18] is an antichrist that's the difference
[43:20] between right and wrong to make me the
[43:23] person of the Lord Jesus Christ would be
[43:25] an anti Christ right for that person of
[43:28] the Lord Jesus is sitting at the right
[43:29] hand of the Majesty on high and will
[43:31] come again in great power and Glory but
[43:33] for his life that was in him being upon
[43:35] me and upon you who have him it's
[43:38] exactly the truth and you become Christ
[43:42] not Jesus Christ but it's the same life
[43:46] in you it's the same life in you that
[43:49] his life is in you the Oneness of
[43:51] himself and the people and and when I
[43:53] say not Jesus Christ not the person the
[43:55] fullness of the person sitting there in
[43:57] the Pew that's not the point that the
[43:59] same life on display that you can be a
[44:02] witness to the world he said that's why
[44:04] he said don't put your light under a
[44:06] bushel don't cover it up cuz you are
[44:08] lights you are the same light just as
[44:10] Jesus was the big light you are little
[44:12] lights to go to your job to go in your
[44:15] family to raise your children to
[44:17] encourage others to be alike to the
[44:19] people at church you are a light because
[44:22] God's light that same light is expressed
[44:25] in you the Oneness of himself in the
[44:27] people is the only grounds of Fellowship
[44:30] that God has ever laid down for himself
[44:32] and his church that's the only grounds
[44:35] of Fellowship now that means the only
[44:38] way that you can ever fellowship with
[44:40] God is to be one with
[44:43] him I'm talking about through a new
[44:45] birth experience where you heard the
[44:48] word and you believed it and you
[44:50] surrendered yourself to it and his
[44:52] spirit quickened that word in your heart
[44:54] and it became a living it became a birth
[44:57] to you the word is birthed in you so
[45:00] we're talking about eternal life to be
[45:02] United with Christ to have the life of
[45:05] almighty God to be United with him in
[45:08] the spirit of his power is eternal life
[45:11] you're eternally United with God now
[45:15] that means if you're separated from God
[45:18] tonight that God doesn't want you to
[45:19] stay in that
[45:21] condition God made a way for you to be
[45:23] United with him to come in Union with
[45:25] him
[45:26] in Ephesians chap 2:3 it says but now in
[45:29] Christ Jesus you who once were far off
[45:34] have been brought near by the blood of
[45:37] Christ in Psalms 1331 it says behold how
[45:42] good and pleasant it is when Brothers
[45:45] dwell in unity not to argue and fuss and
[45:49] have a big wall between them in John 17:
[45:52] 211 that they may all be one just as you
[45:56] father are are in me and I in you that
[46:00] they also may be in us so that the world
[46:03] may believe that you have sent me now
[46:07] you think about what he's praying there
[46:10] that so that the world may believe that
[46:12] you have sent me that you are actually
[46:15] the witness that God sent that that
[46:18] Jesus was sent into the
[46:21] world that you are the witness because
[46:23] you're a light because you're Union with
[46:30] God I'm going to kind of skip through
[46:32] some of my notes
[46:34] here so y'all hang on I can't I can't do
[46:37] like Andrew lover and just kind of skip
[46:43] through you see what what God is doing
[46:47] is he's dealing with us each as
[46:49] individuals to restore us back into
[46:52] Unity with
[46:54] him to to bring us back into unity all
[46:59] together now brother R said today if we
[47:01] don't live the Christian Life well then
[47:03] would people people can say we're not
[47:05] Christians but if Christ is in you he
[47:09] lives his life in
[47:11] you oh that's why I kind of belabor the
[47:14] point if you believe it's going to be
[47:18] manifested his life is in you in another
[47:22] place he said Jesus said if I do not the
[47:24] works of my father then believe me not
[47:28] but if I do the works of my father
[47:30] believe the works there you are we ought
[47:34] to be reflecting the life of God in our
[47:37] life what is it it's the Holy Spirit his
[47:40] life in you working his own life through
[47:44] you his own life living in you remember
[47:49] it's still him it's his life in
[47:52] you it's his own Life Tabernacle L
[47:56] himself in you in Romans 8:1 it says
[48:00] there is therefore now no condemnation
[48:02] to them which are in Christ
[48:04] Jesus who walk not after the
[48:07] flesh but after the spirit now there's
[48:11] the thing that the new birth makes us
[48:14] walk not after that carnal mind not
[48:17] after our carnal thinking but because
[48:20] we're uniting with God it's changing the
[48:23] way that we think and the way that we
[48:25] look at things why because we're
[48:28] surrendered to the word surrendering to
[48:31] the word makes you deny your own will
[48:34] your own thoughts now see there's so
[48:36] many times we'll think well I I wish
[48:39] that things would go this certain way or
[48:42] I wish it could be done this certain way
[48:44] but when you surrender to the word and
[48:46] let God have his way God can have his
[48:49] way with your life and make things go
[48:51] the way that he wants them to go in
[48:54] Romans 8:5 it says for they that are
[48:57] after The Flesh do mind the things of
[48:59] the flesh the carnal nature and the
[49:02] carnal thinking and everything that's
[49:04] contrary to the word of God but they
[49:07] that are after the spirit the things of
[49:10] the
[49:11] spirit that's why Paul said in Galatians
[49:14] 3:1 16 this I say then walk in the
[49:19] spirit and ye shall not fulfill the lust
[49:23] of the flesh walk walk in the spirit be
[49:26] surrendered to the spirit be surrendered
[49:29] to God surrendered to his word so that
[49:32] he can change us and fulfill his will in
[49:35] us now Jesus laid out that formula to
[49:38] eternal life to Martha there in John
[49:41] chapter 11: 25 and 26 Jesus said unto
[49:45] her I am the resurrection and the life
[49:48] he that believeth in me though he were
[49:50] dead yet shall he live and whosoever
[49:52] believe liveth and believeth in me shall
[49:55] shall never die you're believing on him
[49:58] until you receive eternal life then
[50:00] eternal life is God's life in you then
[50:02] you're believing in him now that's the
[50:06] difference when you're believing in him
[50:09] cuz it's his life in you that is giv you
[50:12] power to
[50:13] believe oh there's the real a real
[50:16] evidence of a Believer you believe a
[50:18] Believer is going to believe in the good
[50:21] times and bad times and what are you
[50:23] believing in you're believing in a
[50:24] supernatural God
[50:26] that can do things more greater than
[50:28] than anything that you can do with your
[50:29] own abilities anything you can do with
[50:31] your own self It Go Rises you above all
[50:35] of your legalism and all of your works
[50:37] it's not you doing it it's Christ that's
[50:39] doing it oh if we could just have
[50:41] confidence like that when it looks like
[50:44] we've got a big mountain of circumstance
[50:45] in front of us to know that God will
[50:48] bring us through it that God will bring
[50:50] us right through that mountain or over
[50:52] it or around it or he'll remove the
[50:55] mountain
[50:56] one way or another the Mountain's going
[50:57] to move why cuz there's a God on the
[50:59] scene God is on the scene and you're
[51:02] you're not believing on him you're
[51:04] believing in him because there's
[51:07] communion there's no middle wall of
[51:09] partition between him and you he's in
[51:12] there with you he's been vulcanized to
[51:15] your soul he's part of you his life is
[51:17] in there and it's him believing and
[51:19] living and walking and manifesting
[51:21] himself in you now these things are true
[51:25] it looks like so many times you you look
[51:27] at the way the world is and way a lot of
[51:29] people even in the message live and it
[51:31] looks like there's a lot of fake a lot
[51:32] of fake Christianity and whatnot but yet
[51:34] it's true it's true that God is going to
[51:37] have a bride that's in Union with him
[51:39] that God is going to have a group of
[51:41] people that will believe him so much so
[51:43] yielded to him until God can have the
[51:46] preeminence in their life from top to
[51:49] bottom from their feet to their head
[51:51] from the foundation of their experience
[51:54] all the way to the caps Stone God is
[51:56] going to have somebody that will believe
[51:58] him regardless of what all the carnality
[52:00] and all the circumstances and all the
[52:02] mountains in front of their life are
[52:04] they are going to stay right with the
[52:06] word because we can't be one word off
[52:11] not one word off you're one word off you
[52:14] lose your confidence one word off your
[52:17] the word is what gives us confidence in
[52:19] what we believe it gives us confidence
[52:22] that we're really born again you look
[52:24] back in the word and you can identify
[52:25] your life with what the scripture says
[52:27] that your your Born Again experience
[52:29] should be you look back in the word and
[52:31] it identifies who you are and where you
[52:33] come from and it identifies everything
[52:35] it identifies that you can have a hope
[52:37] in Christ that you can have confidence
[52:39] in him it identify it gives you
[52:42] everything that your experience is based
[52:43] on so if you get one word off one word
[52:46] off it just it it it Mars the whole
[52:49] picture oh you see how even in your
[52:51] experience the devil is looking for that
[52:53] one little in your armor the one
[52:55] little Gap in your understanding to get
[52:57] in and that's where he's going to attack
[52:58] you you got to close up every Gap every
[53:01] in the armor every little place so
[53:03] that there's no way for the devil to
[53:05] come and say aha what about this every
[53:08] Gap every every little place has got to
[53:10] be closed up that's where your
[53:12] confidence is that's how you defeat the
[53:15] Devil that's how Jesus defeated the
[53:16] devil when when he came to him after he
[53:18] was after he was baptized there on the
[53:20] Jordan River and began to tempt him with
[53:22] three different times and Jesus
[53:24] everything that everything thing that
[53:25] Jesus said back to him was right out of
[53:27] the scripture doesn't the scripture say
[53:31] and he and he just quoted the word to
[53:32] him and that's how he defeated the devil
[53:34] and that's how you'll defeat the Devil
[53:35] every time you'll not defeat the Devil
[53:37] by some some carnal understanding or
[53:40] some man-made ideas or anything but when
[53:42] you can quote the word back to the devil
[53:45] it'll make the Run make make him
[53:47] run and John chapter 4: 24 it says God
[53:51] is a spirit and they that worship Him
[53:53] must worship Him in spirit and and in
[53:55] truth they that worship Him must worship
[53:58] Him in spirit and in truth the truth
[54:01] that's on the page but the spirit to
[54:04] give the meaning and the essence to it
[54:06] so you really know what the words are
[54:09] saying oh that's what the Holy Ghost
[54:11] does it gives the real Essence and the
[54:14] real meaning of the things that are
[54:16] laying there on the
[54:20] page and oh what you believe you worship
[54:23] God in spirit and Truth and it'll be the
[54:26] same truth the same truth that Jesus
[54:28] stood for when he was on Earth the same
[54:31] life the same
[54:34] Revelation the same
[54:37] character the same
[54:39] character the same character brother Bob
[54:41] the same kindness yes the same truth yes
[54:45] the same love the same
[54:49] compassion the same
[54:51] everything so we can be in God United
[54:55] brother Brandon was sa because Adam and
[54:57] Eve before the fall before the
[55:00] disbelieving of the word was an example
[55:04] of what we could be in
[55:06] him before the fall they were an example
[55:09] of what you and I could be before the
[55:12] fall and complete harmony with God
[55:14] complete Union with
[55:16] God complete Union with
[55:21] God y'all don't make me struggle tonight
[55:24] y'all looking at the floor and the wall
[55:25] and the ceilings and everything come on
[55:27] now at least pull with your
[55:35] eyes come on
[55:37] now we know we make mistakes brother am
[55:39] said but you mustn't look at that it's
[55:41] not your mistakes because you're always
[55:43] going to have them but you see it's
[55:45] following his rules following what he
[55:49] said do stumbl and falling doesn't have
[55:52] one thing to do with it a real true
[55:55] servant if he'll stumble he'll get up
[55:57] again so when you fall get back up what
[56:00] what a blessing to recognize our
[56:02] mistakes when we look into the word and
[56:04] find that we're not measuring up we're
[56:06] not matching up something's wrong to
[56:08] recognize that's what I'm talking about
[56:10] tonight surrender surrender to the word
[56:13] and say if I'm wrong I want to get
[56:15] straightened up I want I want everything
[56:17] to be right if if there's something
[56:19] wrong with my life I want God to get a
[56:21] hold of my life and and and straighten
[56:23] me up oh what a blessing tonight to be
[56:25] able to recognize our mistakes if
[56:27] there's something off-kilter to look
[56:29] into God's word and see where it's
[56:31] telling us where don't measure up and so
[56:34] many people are blind to their
[56:36] predicament in Proverbs 26:12 it says do
[56:39] you see a person wise in their own eyes
[56:42] there's more hope for a fool than for
[56:45] them Proverbs 12:15 says the way of fool
[56:49] seems right to them but the wise listen
[56:51] to advice a wise man will listen to the
[56:54] words of the the word when it tells you
[56:57] you need to be born again or tells you
[56:58] you need to straighten up live a
[56:59] Sanctified life in Luke 18 it says this
[57:03] is the parable of the Pharisee and the
[57:04] tax collector and the story The Pharisee
[57:07] was self-righteous and did not recognize
[57:10] his own need for forgiveness while the
[57:13] tax collector humbly acknowledged his
[57:15] sinfulness and sought God's
[57:19] mercy it's really worse to stubbornly
[57:21] refuse to admit your
[57:23] failure than to stumble and
[57:28] fall his word is what we are to measure
[57:31] ourselves
[57:34] with brother Ram will say we know we
[57:37] make mistakes but you mustn't look at
[57:39] that it's not your
[57:41] mistakes because you're always going to
[57:44] have them yes sir but you see it's
[57:46] following his rules right following what
[57:49] he said do following what he said what
[57:52] did he say to do to believe him
[57:55] to be baptized in the name of the Lord
[57:57] Jesus Christ he said you must be born
[57:59] again that's what he said you got to do
[58:03] what do you got to do get up and give it
[58:05] your all surrender everything to him
[58:08] surrender everything so that God can use
[58:13] you he said now look Adam and Eve in a
[58:16] position to never die in a position to
[58:18] never be old to never be sick to never
[58:20] have a worry you say I sure wish I could
[58:23] be like that I got news for you you are
[58:26] in the same position God places that to
[58:29] every creature on the earth in the same
[58:32] position what was the agreement if
[58:34] you'll keep my words keep my words why
[58:38] cuz we not going to be one word
[58:40] off what what are his words you got to
[58:42] be born again amen be dressed right live
[58:46] holy go to church do unto others forgive
[58:51] others forgive others that your sins
[58:54] might be forgiven
[58:55] put God first don't put anything else
[58:58] before
[59:00] God rise up early in the morning and
[59:03] give God that a long time instead of
[59:05] jumping right on social media put God
[59:07] before all of your
[59:09] Idols put God before everything else put
[59:11] God before your
[59:13] family put God before your
[59:15] church you put your church or somebody
[59:18] at church up on an idol where you're
[59:19] looking at them instead of God and
[59:21] you're spending all that time trying to
[59:22] please somebody else instead of pleasing
[59:24] God but put God first don't lie cheat or
[59:28] steal keep his words keep all those
[59:31] words that he's laid out for us in the
[59:32] Bible for us to live a happy life and
[59:34] you know if you don't lie cheat or steal
[59:36] you'll live a happy life you'll live a
[59:38] life where people can look at you within
[59:40] as a man or a woman of Integrity
[59:42] somebody they can have confidence in
[59:44] somebody they can have trust trust that
[59:46] when they tell you something or confide
[59:48] in you that you're not going to go blab
[59:49] it out to somebody else that you can be
[59:51] a trustworthy individual that you can
[59:54] keep a secret y that you can be trusted
[59:58] with confidence and you know nobody can
[1:00:01] believe the devil's lie because the
[1:00:03] devil's got all his lies nobody can
[1:00:05] believe the devil's lie until they
[1:00:08] disbelieve God's
[1:00:10] truth I I I was thinking today I just
[1:00:13] going meditating on what brother Ram
[1:00:15] said
[1:00:16] here that Satan don't have nothing to
[1:00:19] give but he makes all these promises
[1:00:23] anyway brother Bram said here he said
[1:00:26] Satan will make you all kind of promises
[1:00:28] but he has nothing to give you because
[1:00:29] he don't have nothing he don't have no
[1:00:32] salvation what is Satan anything
[1:00:34] contrary to the word he doesn't have
[1:00:37] salvation he doesn't have light his
[1:00:38] kingdom is Darkness the end thereof is
[1:00:41] death darkness and death is Satan's
[1:00:44] kingdom the only way to stay in Divine
[1:00:47] Fellowship is to keep his
[1:00:50] word I think the word is is the word is
[1:00:54] everything to us if you get off the word
[1:00:57] your your life is on a slippery
[1:00:59] slope Jesus said in John 15:7 he said if
[1:01:02] you abide in me and my words abide in
[1:01:04] you you shall ask what you will and it
[1:01:08] shall be done unto you amen now those
[1:01:10] are the words layer on on the page but
[1:01:12] if you believe that and you have
[1:01:14] confidence in that it it's got to be
[1:01:18] true in Psalm 119 1-2 he said blessed
[1:01:22] are the undefiled in the way who walk in
[1:01:24] the the law of the Lord blessed are they
[1:01:27] that keep his testimonies and that seek
[1:01:29] him with the whole heart blessed are
[1:01:32] those who want what God Said and are
[1:01:36] willing to surrender themselves to it
[1:01:39] surrender to the word to be able to
[1:01:41] admit when they've done wrong to admit
[1:01:43] when they're walking wrong when they're
[1:01:44] not doing right to straighten their
[1:01:47] lives up to live right and to walk right
[1:01:49] and do
[1:01:52] right in Psalm 119 : 889 it says forever
[1:01:56] oh Lord Thy word is settled in
[1:02:00] heaven Thy word is settled in
[1:02:03] heaven and the Oneness and fellowship
[1:02:05] back there when Adam and Eve were in the
[1:02:07] garden was broke between God and his
[1:02:09] children the minute that Eve disbelieved
[1:02:12] one little paragraph one little word of
[1:02:15] God she disbelieved maybe maybe like
[1:02:18] sitting here this afternoon if you
[1:02:21] disbelieve that you can be healed if you
[1:02:23] disbel that you can have peace so you're
[1:02:26] not going to have peace like that but
[1:02:29] you set your mind set your thoughts on
[1:02:31] what God Said and you watch God begin to
[1:02:34] work in your life you begin to think
[1:02:36] that I don't believe he's going to be
[1:02:38] able to back up his
[1:02:39] promises oh but on the contrary if you
[1:02:41] believe that God will back up his
[1:02:43] promises and come like Paul said come
[1:02:45] boldly to the throne of grace you watch
[1:02:47] and see if God do back up his word
[1:02:49] that's right you begin to think that God
[1:02:52] don't care or he's not the same today as
[1:02:54] he was yesterday and and there's that
[1:02:56] middle wall between you but God tore
[1:02:59] down that wall he wants you to have
[1:03:00] Union with him so that he can fulfill
[1:03:02] these promises that he is the same
[1:03:05] yesterday today and forever he's still
[1:03:09] the
[1:03:10] same look that you can't be happy
[1:03:12] without without God there's no way to
[1:03:15] have true joy and peace without God
[1:03:18] that's the only way and then in every
[1:03:20] man woman boy and girl there's that
[1:03:23] thirst that thirst that's can only be
[1:03:25] quenched by God something in you where
[1:03:28] you know you got to have it something
[1:03:30] that's something that's draw in
[1:03:32] you there's got to be something to
[1:03:34] quench this thirst and all the drugs and
[1:03:38] alcohol and cigarettes and all of those
[1:03:40] things they'll never satisfy this thirst
[1:03:43] because there's only one thirst that can
[1:03:45] satisfy this and that's
[1:03:48] God there's only one
[1:03:52] thing disbelieving God disbelieving
[1:03:56] God's word causes everything to fall
[1:03:58] fall
[1:03:59] apart and we'll stop there as the
[1:04:01] musicians come
[1:04:05] forward God promised to bring us back
[1:04:07] into
[1:04:08] Fellowship back into Unity back into
[1:04:12] Oneness and that's the reason you got to
[1:04:14] be in Union with God to let God have his
[1:04:17] way with you to surrender to
[1:04:21] him and allow the word to have pre imess
[1:04:24] in your
[1:04:27] life God's word is
[1:04:29] truth and everything the devil has is
[1:04:32] lies that's all he's got it's just a lot
[1:04:36] of
[1:04:37] lies but we've got the truth laying here
[1:04:40] in the pages of the
