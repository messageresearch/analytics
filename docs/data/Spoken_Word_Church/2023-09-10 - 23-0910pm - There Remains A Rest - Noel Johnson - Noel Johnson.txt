have with the with the brother between services and um I tell you what you uh get to talk to somebody who's had the experiences that he has in India and overseas and my goodness just the respect that um that we have for for a man that has devoted his life and become a prisoner to the word to give to give himself like he has amen so um Let's uh we we certainly heard a wonderful message this morning about identifying ourselves in the word and if we can know who we are then uh the devil can't do nothing to us we've got we've got power that God has given to us if we can just identify ourself in the scripture if we can know who we are so I believe that the word is still a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart so if you have a need this afternoon just um open up your heart to receive it from God and I'm sure that God will meet your need is but let's sing let's sing as our brother comes forth to minister to us and uh God bless you Open the Eyes of My Heart [Music] I want to see to see you [Music] Lord Open the Eyes of My Heart I want to see [Music] what I want I want to see you [Music] shining in the light of your glory pour out your power and love that's between [Music] shining in the light [Music] holy [Music] holy holy You Are Holy Holy Holy yes your holy holy holy I want to see you Hallelujah you know the thing that we need to do now is see the Christ in each one of us sometimes our flesh gets in the way but God hides behind the badger skin and sometimes there's just a lot of badger skin but it's the life that lives in it that's what makes the difference while you're standing if you'd open your Bibles to Hebrews the fourth chapter and we'll read verses one two and three we've been I guess I can say I enjoyed this morning I don't know if y'all did but there are times when a minister gets up to preach and seems like God sits down and then it's really difficult but God was with us this morning and I I really appreciated that Hebrews the fourth chapter it says starting in verse 1 it says let us therefore fear as to promise being leftist of entering into his rest any of you should seem to come short of it For unto us was the Gospel preached as well as unto them but the word preached did not profit them not being mixed with faith in them that heard it for we which have believed to enter into arrest as he said as I have sworn in my wrath if they shall enter into my rest although the works were finished from the foundation of the world and let's have word of Prayer our most gracious and loving Heavenly Father it is again our privilege to come and sit at your feet and to receive what you'd have for us this afternoon is my lot Lord again to stand before the purchase of your blood and Lord that's an awesome responsibility so Lord come and let you Minister let the words that are spoken Lord may they come from you so guide the thoughts of my mind The Words which I speak that Lord you might be glorified in US Grant this Lord I ask it in Jesus Christ's name amen you can be seated brother Branham in the first seal he makes mention of the fact that he has now called I am no longer going to call you Church but I'm going to call you bride so with the first seal that's when we actually in my opinion we've entered the bright age brother Branham from this point on in his ministry it took a turn because no longer was he trying to deal with so much the denominational system as he was sitting there and trying to take the bride and begin to encourage the bride this is who you are this is what you are because the bride has to grasp hold of what she is I can look through brother Brown's life in Ministry and I can see over the over the period of his life I can see where where God began to deal with him and different things and he came to more and more of a revelation of who he was when he started out he was a Baptist preacher God still deal with him giving him visions and things and God dealt with him in that way so that really he began to take and realize that whenever God gave him a vision that was true and he knew that exactly what what to do in the vision is exactly what would happen but then later on he began to look at how God dealt with him and he says he and and he began to go through the scriptures and all of a sudden he realizes the same way that God speaks to Prophet that's the way he's speaking to me and then he realized he had a he was a prophet and he and if you will he stepped into that Ministry later on when he when the discernment began he go he related it back he says well this is the same way that God was there speaking to Abraham and Sarah and so he and he refers back to that a number of times and then he basically began to step into that Ministry and then later on he began to he preached and I think it was in 63. he he preached the the church ages and it was after that I think it was the angel spoke to him and says now you read Malachi 4. and I think at that point in time then he realized he was the messenger to this age and he stepped into that office if you will and then when you come to the time of the seals you realize no I am the Messenger and I have been given a message and that message is to forerun the second coming of Jesus Christ and he and he says I have to be obedient to that message and he stresses that over and over and over again after the seals well he had to step into his office as he progressed through time well where are we we are the bride we've been sitting under the ministry of a prophet we've been sitting under and where God is actually trying to speak to the bride and tell her this is who you are this is what you are and we have to we have to move from the lady you'll see in church age we have to move and come up higher as John was spoken to come up higher come into the place where the revelation of the word come into the revelation of the seventh seal come into the revelation of who you are because now we have to step into the revelation of Who We Are we no longer can just church is not more than a Sunday morning social function no we have to become the message the message happens to be something we read or something we hear no we have to literally become what God says that we are we have to become the message for this hour and so here again like I say this this is a step that we have to take but it ain't it takes a change in our thinking because then you go into nominational systems and they remind you no you're just a sinner Say by Grace no this message tells me I am a Son of God who have been fully restored to my position with my father and if I have been fully restored to my positions my father I have the rights of of of a sonship in in that but then now it's coming to the place where we have to come to adoption that's right where it's no longer just learning how to do and learning how to do and learning how to do but now all of us and we've been taught and taught and taught now it's time for us to practice what we've what we have been taught you you take a person that goes to medical school yeah they teach you all the theory and they teach you this and they teach you all that but all of a sudden now you have to stand before a person and you have to diagnose we have to take all of that training and all of that knowledge and you have to apply it to the situation that you're at because now you are the responsible for that life well we have heard the message over and over and over again now we are responsible to take this message and live it further Madam in one place he says the people in in in in Wesley's time he says they took his message and they lived it yeah they became living Epistles read of all men so whenever some people see us now what should we be we should be the living examples of this message whenever they look at us they should be able to see the message and manifestation in in our lives it goes in Revelation 4 1 after this I looked and behold a door was open in heaven and a voice which I heard from the trumpet speaking with me come up hither I'm going to show you some things we know that the door is Jesus Christ so we at the the world is sitting in lady Lucia they're stuck there no but we are called to come higher we have to go through the door we have to be in Christ and one what what what what did John Hill he went up into the heavenlies and there all of a sudden the word was being opened to them the word was be revealed was being revealed to them when we look at the seals all of a sudden brother Brown says the book became a totally new book to you because no longer because he could go back and he could see the types he says well this this is the same way that God did here the same way that God did there and therefore he could take this and this and this and this and he could pull them all together see because it's the same spirit it's the same way that God had been working all the way through so he can relate things before he couldn't relate well now it has to come down unto us we have to be able to take the message we have to take the word of God and we have to go through the word of God and brother bounces we have to find ourselves in that word and when we find ourselves in that word and we can see that God always operated this way and this way and this way where God never changes well if God never changes and we approach God in the same way that and then God will have to operate through us the same way that he did back in there Jesus Christ yesterday today and forever so when two or three agree does touching any one thing if we ask God and God's presence is there then we know that God has already heard us and then we expect the results I mean that when we pray what do we expect all right why pray if you don't expect it I mean like one person said why worry if you're going to worry don't pray but if you pray don't worry I mean this is where it comes out but see this has to be a reality to us it has to be more than just words it changes our whole concept our whole way of thinking like I said let this mind be in you which was also in Christ he knew who he was he knew he was God expressed in human flesh well what are we we are now God expressed in human flesh all that God was important to Christ everything the Christ was the important to the church and therefore the church the bride has become the full manifestation of God upon the face of this Earth this is Who We Are this is who we are but we have to accept this life we have to look beyond our flesh we have to look beyond our shortcomings we have to look beyond our carnality we have to look at all all the mistakes we make like somebody says you know when what's the biggest mistake you made well this morning was getting out of bed okay but we have to come to the place where we're literally the word becomes such a reality to us until we actually step into him and then we allow him to lead into guiding directors through the life that we live I know there are times I get up in the morning since I'm retired my time is my own um but I also find out also I get up in the morning and I have my day planned out and all of a sudden we get a phone call and all of a sudden that takes care of that day you know God had something else in mind or we go someplace else and all of a sudden something else comes up and say well Laura obviously you have something else planned for me today just just lead me on but it's learning to follow the leading I know when we're in India you know it's when I'm in the states I figure I have control of what I'm doing I'm under that delusion but when I go into India I realize I'm not totally and I have no control over anything all of a sudden something will come up well you have to deal with it all of a sudden we're going to go here instead of here well okay Lord what are you wanting us to do and then situations arise people who need to want to be prayed for and all of a sudden the the the whole everything just changes so I figured well Lord obviously you have a different plan than what I have so Lord I have to follow your leading well now we have to do that even even you know just just to hear in the states we have to we have to be willing to be led by God I think I might have quoted this or in the morning he says in the bride coming of Christ coming out of the church there'll be have to be a shave waived again in the last days well that's what when when you look at brother Brown's Ministry that was the shave that was Jesus Christ coming and so expressing himself through the ministry of brother Branham it what was the whole thing it's to it's to show that the the full maturity of the word in his full power has been restored to the bride that means all of the power of God has been given to us there's no there there it's not you know we're not going to give you a little here and a little there no you have access to everything that's right but it takes the faith of it takes faith in God to operate that gift it takes the faith of God to actually believe that whatever he said that is true but too often we we we we we we we will not grasp over the fact we we lack the faith because we look at ourselves it's not about us it's never been about us it's always been about him brother Branham realizes not what I do it's what I allow God to do through me he says I have to take myself and I have to submit myself totally unto the will of God so that God can actually speak through me and God can lead me and God can guide me and God can have me do the different things that he does he says the things that you see on the platform he says this is nothing compared to what I have in real life all sudden God will tell me I want you to go to such and such a city I want you to be at a certain Street Corner such and such a time somebody's going to come this is the way they're going to be dressed they're going to have this problem and this problem this problem I want you to pray for them and I want you to leave and so he would go there he would be on the straight corner or something the person would come along he would pray for them and as soon as he was done praying he would he would he would he would exit he never stuck around for a thank you he never stuck around for him to be glorified oh my and brother Branham prayed for me also and they look around well where's this guy he did not want them to recognize him they wanted to recognize Jesus Christ they wanted to give the glory to Jesus Christ for the healing they wanted to acknowledge Jesus Christ was the one that provided for their needs and this is the way it comes with us when any time that we take ourselves and try and build ourselves up we're doing wrong it's not about us and everything points back to Jesus Christ brother Brown he says I wish the brother Brown Tabernacle was not named brother random Tabernacle I wish there was no you know there was nothing to remind the people of who I am he says I want people to see Jesus Christ well that's what we're supposed to be doing we're supposed to be having Jesus Christ live his life out through us that it's no longer us living but now it's God living his life through us and that way God gets all the glory so the full maturity of the word has been turned back to us in its full power if you believe that then use it but it's not for you to use for yourself it's for you to use so God can be glorified like I mentioned I think earlier I said brother Bradham he says oh yeah bring the hard cases bring the deaf and the Blind and the Blind and all this other kind of stuff and he says and and the angel says don't you do that he says I God placed that gift in you for a God to use well why is the power of God residing in you so God could use the power so God could be glorified so God could exalt himself it's also you know when I was looking at different things when when you begin to to look at how Jesus Christ in his ministry there was one man he was born blind that man had to be blind for so many be a number of years so Jesus Christ could come along and give him his sight why then so he could testify to the Sanhedrin Jesus Christ is God nobody else can do this but him so he had to live his life in blindness up until that point and we'll say God can come along and and could pay for them and give the man his sight so that he could testify before the Sanhedrin we don't understand the things going on in our life why did Esther have to be already being taken away from her uncle and going to you know be part of the Harem of of the king so that she could become the queen so then all of a sudden persecution came to the Jewish people all of a sudden she was in a position to save her own people you look at Joseph in his life what had happened God had given him dreams oh yeah my brothers are going to bow down to me even my parents are going to bow down unto me how is this going to be taking place he had to be sold into slavery he had to be put into prison and he had to sit in that prison until all of a sudden Pharaoh had a dream and then all of us oh yeah I remember yeah but there was me and you you didn't like to cook so you could kill the cook and you let me live but yeah this guy interpreted this dream he had to be in a particular prison he couldn't just be in any prison he had to be in the particular one and then all of a sudden Pharaoh called him up and says oh you interpret the dream he did and that's when all of a sudden is his brothers and stuff came and they had to bow down before but he had to go through all of that in his life to bring him to that point in his life where the vision that God had given or the dream that God had given him could come to its fulfillment well dick can you look back in your life why are you where you are how how did God direct your life to bring you to the places where you're at because God wants to fulfill something it's not just so that we can sit there and enjoy life or do whatever we're doing no he has a purpose for us being alive he has a purpose for his being here he has elected us for this generation that they tell me in running a race he says they always in a relay race they saved the best for last because he has to make up for he or she has to make up for the for the for the the the lack of speed and the other other ones we're the best we have to finish the race if we don't finish the race nobody else can come they the all those that have gone on before us they won't receive their Eternal reward they won't okay so we have to finish this race what is US finishing the race we have to become the maturity we have to be the bride we have to be the bride manifested we have to sit there we have to be the final voice to the final age we have to be the final manifestation of God in this generation because so that God can be glorified we are in Satan's Eden we stand out as a sore thumb because uh what's going on even Even in our nation he says they don't like Christianity they're doing everything they can against Christianity and when we're here all of a sudden if we challenge them all of a sudden we're you know we're caught taken before the magistrates and all the other kind of stuff because they don't like Christianity they're against everything that Christ stood for and so we are here and we are witnessing by the Lives who he lives and the things which we do or we are witnesses to the people that we go around the people we do our business with they have this notice something's different about you I I know I know my wife she worked as a doula it's a it's a labor support person and uh she worked for a number of years in a hospital there and um all of a sudden a lady would come in and she was having difficulty um and so all of a sudden Charlie would look at the situation quietly she would just pray and all of a sudden whatever the situation was it just changed the nurses and says you pray didn't you well yeah that's why I'm here well I mean but you know there were Miracles performed because she was there so that the women at the breach was if the baby was raised birth or something else or some other problems or things which were going on simply because she was there she could intercede for the patient which was there and by interceding all of a sudden everything changed well we when we come up and somebody had comes to us and wants prayer do you believe in your prayer if you believe in it then God will act upon it but if you do if you're just praying a prayer just to pray a prayer you might as well save your breath but if you could actually enter into the spirit of Christ and you can actually begin to enter into the suffering if you could enter into their feelings that they have all of us that oh this is going to be different because then it's no longer you now it's God working through you it's God ministering through you and then they'll all of a sudden then they'll give glory to God I know she's not going to like me for this there was a lady my wife does alterations for periodically this one lady came in and she brought something to be altered and and she said oh man I'm suffering terrible headache so Shirley says okay so Shirley put her hands pray for her and then started with doing the alteration stuff and a few minutes later this is my headache's all gone sure it had to go I mean I don't know how else to explain it if I pray I expect it if she prays she expects it well if we are expecting it and we believe it's it's God anointing us to do what we're doing then why not expect it and we expected that we expect automate the the outcome of whatever it is we prayed for right Paul in in this in the in what we read in the in in uh in Hebrews here Paul is referring to the children of Israel as they were delivered from Egypt and it's interesting when you begin to look at them all of a sudden here was God God sent Moses now Moses God had ordained to be the deliverer for the children of Israel um he tried it and his own efforts and he failed he had to run out of town he had to protect him you know save his own life he sent him in way brother batam expands it brother God gave him a hot tempered wife to kind of bring him down a few notches to the place where he could no longer speak he could no longer have a confidence in himself he would stutter and um he went out to the to the goats just to get away from household things and uh but if God had to bring him to the place I mean Moses was raised in all the the knowledge of the Egyptian he was being trained to be the next Pharaoh he had to be able to lead an army he had to be able to stand and if you're going to lead an army you have to stand there and have confidence where you're taking them in otherwise they're not going to follow I mean I was in the military I learned that a long time ago you got somebody well maybe we should maybe we shouldn't I'm not sure we should no no I ain't going to follow him but all of us as a Shard we gotta we're going to take this hill we have the power we have this we have that and he said come on man let's go okay by that by the enthusiasm yeah we'll we'll charge up the mountain because there's somebody we have a leader in front of us as all of us and we have confidence in well we have to have confidence in our God people had to have confidence in Moses if he was going to lead the children of Israel out but God had to reduce him to the place where Moses could no longer even had confidence in himself but then at the burning bush all of a sudden that'll change because all of a sudden he met something which would take the gift which God had placed in him from the beginning and he would take that gift and he would activate it for lack of a better word so when he went back into Egypt what did he do he all of a sudden he says the God has sent me here to lead you out of this out of out of Egypt and then God performed Miracles through him so people could have faith why did God send the prophet maybe when we were in denominational system what are the denominational system they had a theory of God they had a theory oh yeah God used to do this and God used to do that and we know God you're there there was healing yeah we can read in the Bible that God did healing here and God did Miracles here but all of a sudden when God came and brother Branham and all of a sudden that we saw the Miracles in the manifestation like one Minister said all of a sudden God was updated he became a reality God became more than something just a theory God was more than just a spirit that floats Around Here There and Everywhere else no all of a sudden God became a reality to him well when I was introduced to this message I mean I was raised in a Baptist Church yeah they hear stories but all of a sudden in brother Brown's life all of a sudden there there's miracles I mean this is book of Acts again I mean this goes back to Jesus Christ This goes back back into the Bible this goes back into the reality that God is actually real well if God Is that real and that was that real to him now we have to take that same God or have it real in US because if you leave it on the prophet it does you no good but all of a sudden when you can take whether God that was in him and place that same God in you and begin to realize God is the same yesterday today and forever then all of a sudden that God becomes a reality to you and the more you walk with him the more of a reality he becomes I mean we've seen situations in our in there was one situation that we were at in India just to give you an idea um I'm always punctual that's bad habit but that's just the way I am and we were sitting there and and the brothers were yeah they they like to eat so they ate and they kept eating and we we released we left about two hours later than we should have to go to the next meeting which made me all upset and then we get into the to this Village we were at and and here again I mean we were late and I was mad I'm being honest with y'all and all of a sudden this guy jumps out in front of the car stop stop emergency emergency I figured great we're already late what are we going to do now here's this guy what's going on so they led us down this alleyway Last House on the Left we entered into this into the little Hut and all of us know is this girl probably mid-20s and I looked at her and I figured what's the deal going on well some Minister had told her you have an evil Wicked spirit because your husband and your children had died and you have to fast for 40 days in order for this evil spirit to leave they don't have the mass they don't have what it would take to fast for 40 days this girl I'm in obedience to what this man had said she tried that she got to the place where all of her systems was being getting to shut down her her liver and her kidneys and all the other kind of stuff they finally took her to the hospital and they looked at her and says she's Beyond hope there's nothing we can do for her and I looked at the situation I says and all of a sudden I when I prayed I said Lord don't look at the stupidity of the ACT but look at the sincerity of her heart and give her her life back from that point on her system's rejuvenated and for Sheila I think she lived for about two or three years after that nice strong healthy young woman it's not about me but I mean my mental condition was anything but prayer but yet God intervened because he had a need and he wanted to use me in that position to sit there and Speak Life back into that young lady so God you don't know the situation that you're going to be and you don't know all of a sudden you might end up in a situation where all of a sudden there's an emergency and God wants to use you to pray the life back into that person or be able to pray for somebody to give them the healing or pray for somebody for the needs which they are it's not about the person it's about the God in you if we can get it away from us and begin to realize no this is God this is the god that's Eternal this is the god that created the universe this is the god who walked us who we look in in the life of Jesus Christ this is the same God that dwelts in him dwells in you the same God it was in the prophet dwells in you there's no difference that was merely the body that God wanted to use at that period of time but now what hasn't God has taken the prophet home what is he wanting to do now he's in our body yes he's in you he dwells in you there's no difference here you have to release the god that is in you you have to all of a sudden yield to the spirit of God as he guides and he as he directs your life because yoka will run across situations all of a sudden God needs you there's nobody else around God needs you so just open up and follow the leadership of God in your life God is no respecter of persons it says in Isaiah Whom Shall he teach knowledge and to whom shall he make to understand Doctrine them that are weaned from the Malkin drawn from the breasts for precept must be upon precept precept upon precept line up online line upon line here little and there little for with stammering lips and another tongue will he speak to this people to whom he said this is the rest which will you may cause the weary to rest and this is refreshing but they would not hear he's talking here what we talk what we talk about the baptism of the Holy Spirit when all of a sudden I mean we speak in tongues you know I'm used to some students some don't um but that's basically what this is referring to but this is the rest it's no longer should be a struggle if we can rest in God and God leading then there's no struggle then there's no fight then there then there's no there's no problem if if you've been taken if you've been taken and been trained in a certain way then then you know type people are they're mechanics I mean if you've done it enough all of a sudden somebody brings a car in it has this problem in this one oh yeah I've seen that a hundred times yeah okay bring it over here we'll take care of it there's rest you're not struggling wonder what it is wonder what the problem is no no you know because of by your team for by your training and by your teaching and by the knowledge that you have you know how to fix this problem because you've seen it before well Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever he already knows the problem he already has the answer so if you can rest in him and let him do the work through you then it's no longer you trying it's no longer you struggling well Lord what am I supposed to do what am I supposed to do how should I do this I said no no just rest in him and then all of a sudden he will give you the inspiration he will give you the words to say because it's no longer about you and then it becomes about him and God wants to take care of the need before and all of a sudden it becomes him operating and working through you we talked about it and I guess earlier this morning faith is unconscious we all have faith we just don't realize it we don't exercise it because we would take Faith if we would we begin to realize God is the one in control I mean I I mean I look at all of a sudden you know we were in India and we came back and we had plans to go someplace else and all of a sudden covet hit but that set the world down there was no flights going anywhere okay well was this a surprise to God he knew about it he knew what our government would do he knew what the airlines would do he know that I couldn't get to India if I had wanted to for that uh what almost two years there was no way to get into India in fact one guy he lived in India and he happened to have been in Africa doing something it took me almost a year to be able to get back home and then he finally got a flight and it just got into Bombay and then but there was no other flights within the country so then he had to rent a car and he had to drive all the way from the from the west coast to the east coast and and he had to get some other people to help Supply the money for the gas and stuff but he was almost a year before he got home because there was no way to get home the people in Indy all of a sudden they found themselves if you were in a work crew and somebody had hired and he normally he goes into a village and hires all the able-bodied men and he would take them hundreds of miles away all of a sudden there was no Transportation they had to walk a hundred miles or better just to get home but God knows this it wasn't a surprise to him because what's he doing he's taking the whole world and he's changing the whole economy of the world what so the every all the economies have to fall the our economy in America has to fall because this will bring in the this it has to fall so the Jesus Christ can come and set up his kingdom for the Millennium so that's why everything is the way that it is that's why our economy is going to where it's going hi everybody God has a plan God has a purpose but if we know that it's God then why do we worry because we rest in him he promised to supply our needs he promised to take care of us he promised to heal us he promised to see to it but I think what David he said I've never seen the the children of God begging bread well okay so I'm I that's what I expect Lord if all of a sudden there's nothing all of us are okay I don't know how you supply it but you said you would so now we just wait for it to come there um there's a book I read the Reese Howell the intercessor this was written during the second World War and the guy had an orphanage and and this is one important thing and the thing um all of a sudden he had a bunch of kids to feed and there was no food and God spoke to me says well if you have the food what would you do Well we'd thank him for it well so they started praying and thanking God and there was nothing on the table well third we thank you for the food you supplies we thank you for the blessing that you you know and as soon as he said amen there was a knock at the door there was a bread truck that broke down just in front of the orphanage and it had no way to deliver the bread so all that bread got to the orphanage God already knew but he was trying the man he says where's your faith where is your faith another one that God had told him he says I want you to go to a certain certain city the guy says I don't have any money for the point for the for the for the for the Trade Fair and God says well if you had it what would you do well I'd get in line well okay he gets in line all of a sudden it's he was the next one to step up to the window and somebody says here somebody told me God told me to give you this God is never late but he's always very seldom early because he wants do you trust me have you raised a place in your relationship with me that you trust me because this is where it's going to come down to us in our lives do we trust God do we actually acknowledge Him has it come to the place in our relationship with God regardless of what happens are you do we believe that God's going to supply do we believe that God will take care of us do we believe that God will do this but we have to come down to the place where we actually believe this like like I think I might have read this this morning he said that the disciples had the word because Jesus Christ was there and Jesus Christ says I'm giving you the authority to go and to heal the sick and raise the Dead go around to The Villages send them out two by two and so they would go out and and I kept wondering you know if they when they came to a village and they saw a cripplet sitting at the gate um what what was their reaction they had seen Jesus do all the Miracles they knew he could but them to do it but then they went ahead and they prayed for the man at the gate the man made me he was a and all of a sudden God healed them and that would have given them faith and then they would have gone on further and they would go into the villages and then after where they got together and all had a they began to give testimony service of what God had done for them as they'd walked into the different Villages and seen all these things and and my in my mind's thinking Jesus Christ would have sat back and he would have rejoined finally you understand finally you understand and then and finally he said he says no no about the Miracles and stuff he says he says that should be normal to you because of who you are you're sons of God this is your rightful position this is what you should be doing he's a big Rejoice because your name's written in heaven Rejoice because you are a part of God Rejoice because you are part of God from the beginning this is who you are this is what you should be doing this and and so all of a sudden because of that then then they could go and they could begin to do the different thing but then this one man brought it to another his kids to the disciples after a while and and and the disciples didn't they they couldn't cast The Demon out of the man out of the Sun and Jesus says you know bring him to me and Jesus began to pray with me and the disciples asked why couldn't we do this he says because you didn't have a faith oh ye of little faith have you had the faith to believe it this would have been taken care of why do I have to do this God should have been able to do it through you but you have to have the faith you have to understand who you are they have to begin to realize that we are they were Sons and Daughters of God they had to realize that God now dwelt in them that Jesus Christ had given them the authority to do and to take care of of the situations which which fell before them and God is that Authority has never been removed The Authority that Jesus Christ gave the disciples that Authority is still still available to all of us but you have to believe it like I said the talk we were eating there in in the scripture he says he says God had taken it through Moses and he'd performed all these Miracles and all these wonderful things like that God was trying to demonstrate to them this is who I am I control the weather I control I can I can create I can destroy I can do all these these things but you have to have faith in me you have to believe that I am God you have to believe that I can do all things that I am all I'm I am also praying I am all-powerful you have to believe this he got with that was God was trying to demonstrate but it goes on to them for for the um was the Gospel of Praise as well as unto them but the word preach did not profit them not being mixed with the in faith that it heard it and when you go into one of the Psalms the the way that the psalmist pushed it he says oh yeah God provided this let's see if he can do this now God provided a certain quiet or maybe he can supply us beef God did this and to him well let's see if he can do that but they were always challenging God it wasn't that they had faith in that God they were just trying to putting out to God well let's see if you can do this this is what we want now let's see if you can do this and that wasn't how God operated but it comes down to we we've we've seen through the prophets Ministry we have seen God perform there is no questions in our mind that's why people always wanted to go see the prophet or if the prophet prays for me I know I can be healed what about your what about your your pastor what about the one sitting next to you you don't believe in their prayers I know when we were in India that there was a sister that came up I was praying for one person and the guy I was with he was praying for this other sister and uh so then what I was praying for left and so this lady came over to me I looked at her and I said do you believe his prayer and she just stared at me I said if you didn't believe his prayer you won't believe in mine so just go I mean brother Bradham says if you prayed for something he says don't go back the second time because it showed you didn't have faith the first time and the more that you go up for the same thing he says all of a sudden your faith becomes less and less and less no you have to take God at his word you have to really he prayed for me and God he they laid hands on me if they laid hands on me I am healed because God said I'm Healed and you just accept it and you begin to thank him for it I I know there was a time during the Cove it surely was was real sick and I had prayed for her and stuff but I I wanted something a little more I guess you'd call it during covert we were only allowed 10 people in church I found out there was only seven so we could go I went to the pastor and I said surely is sick the Bible says call for the Elders of the church let them lay hands on them let them anoint with oil prepare our faith shall save the sick I says I want that from my wife okay they anoint her with oil they prayed for her yeah it was a done deal I did what the scriptures had taught I needed that extra little things that I could relate back to the scriptures with so I could shall and say no say do we we follow what God Said in his words because we follow what God Said to his word now God is obligated to fulfill his word in her life and from that point on we began to thank him thank you Lord for this and thank you Lord for doing this and the other when I was in uh we were in in Youth Camp we we've helped out there for a number of years and it was interesting we were there and uh we had one service and you know at the end of the service the the the Evangelist or the minister he gives an altar call and all these people come running forward and so we as the ministers we went ahead and laid hands on the different ones and tried to figure out their needs and pray for them accordingly the next night also another Minister and he gave him an altar column I noticed the same amount of people came forward okay so we went and prayed and prayed and prayed third night was the same I says Lord I don't understand this why can't they accept but we have already prayed for them for and some thoughts came in my mind for the lack of better way of expressing it where all of a sudden it's kind of like Astoria says there was this there was this girl and she was out in the streets begging I mean her clothes was filthy her hair was a mess and just and she was begging just give me a little piece of bread just just a little more sort of bread I'm so hungry just serve with me just a little bit of something and finally I mean she did this for a while and finally she says you know there there's a guy in the mountain on the hilltop and uh maybe he'll be nice maybe he will give me something and so she goes up in the door and she knocks in the door and the good man of the house opens it up and she is begging please give me just a little piece of bread just just a little more sir but I'm so hungry I haven't eaten for days just a little something and all of a sudden the man looks at now and says sure sweetheart what are you doing out here begging you you're my wife this is this is your house oh honey look at your clothes they're so filthy go in and take a bath you know washing of the Water by the word oh and you're dressed there's plenty hanging in there just just clothe yourself in the garments of righteousness and there we have table spread we've been waiting for you to come back and everything that you want to eat has always been there it's all been waiting for you to come you don't have to beg this is yours this is your house this is where you live we don't have to beg I don't go to God as a beggar I go to him as his wife because I'm his bride right I go to him as his right washing of the Water by the word I'm clothed in his righteousness every time I read the word it's just cleansing me and cleansing me it's keeping me pure and what do I do I sit down at his table it's always spread out before me and I just Feast upon the word I Feast upon I listen to the message I listen to it I read it I study it and I go through the Bible and I read it and I study it it just constantly taking the word into my life into my until literally I and the word hopefully eventually will just become one but I don't have to beg and that's what these kids were doing they're always begging for a morsel of Breadwinners rightfully theirs by who they were there's one Minister here this one sister was there and I mean there were men too okay I'm not picking on the sisters but to this this was the example and and this girl was crying out and crying out and crying out and finally the ministers went over there and says why don't you start thanking him don't beg why don't you start thanking him for what you're wanting and so she changed her tune she began to praise God and thank him for whatever it was she had Nita and a few minutes later all of a sudden she was running the aisles she was standing rejoicing because she was no longer begging she had accepted now what God has rightfully given her by virtue who she is you don't have to beg God he wants he actually wants to give it to you he wants to give you about to play press down overflowing or something he wants to give it to you because of who you are you are his child you are his wife so why beg I mean my wife and I yeah we you know she has the credit card she knows where the bank balance is you know I says you know just don't overdraw you're fine but I mean it it it's if we have it why not okay why should I deny her what she has need of when I have the means to provide for that well God is no different he is he is our husband he and and there's no limits to him you have need of healing he's already healed you it's already paid for why not just accept it why not just praise him for it healing is a process it's not a miracle healing is a process so sometimes we get sick so yeah I mean I I get sick so my body tells me lay down drink fluids go to bed get some rest okay so I obey what my body is dictating to me I lay down I drink plenty of fluids get lots of rest and all of a sudden my body has the ability to heal itself from within guess how God created us if I don't listen to what it says I pay for it the next day but here again God has already created God has already made it Satan has put the sickness on fine but God is already my healer so I thank him for my healing but I also have to sometimes I have to give my body the rest I have to have to allow it to to heal itself in the revelation of Jesus Christ brother brownie says it talks about Christ in Christ in the true church he says Satan cannot stand it he knows that the people get a true revelation of the true church and what she is and what she stands for she can she can do the Greater Works and she will become an invincible Army Invincible means undefeatable so why are we defeated because we're not willing to accept Who We Are what is it that dwells inside of us God he's not some little wimp he's not so little nothing that has is afraid of oh no Satan's here again oh no I better behave oh no I better back up and let oh Hogwarts no we have control over him we have the ability to fight him Jesus could call Ten Thousand Angels well we have access to everything that's Heaven brother Branham says God brother Robin says that God will bankrupt Heaven before he'll let out any of his promises fall so why don't we access it I mean why don't we claim who we are why don't we exercise The Authority that has been given to us by virtue of who we are we are his sons and we are his daughter and even more than that we are his wife I know what somebody attacks my wife they have to go through me I will defend her well what do you think God will do Satan's attacking um he better not attack his wife he's got God on his hands but we have to believe this it doesn't do any good to recite it it has to be a reality to uh to us we actually have to have the faith to believe that the god that is in US is has the ability and is willing to go into a fight for us to protect us into Garden to provide for us we have to actually believe this and once you begin to believe this once you begin to accept it then the party's over then all of a sudden Satan comes puts his ugly head up and you just come on come on boy I want to give you a good one this time I mean but this is our rights I mean I make it in a humorous thing but you get the point why let him defeat us we have the authority he's given us that Authority he said that he said according to the message the full maturity the word has been restored to us it is full power that means everything that God is has been restored to us God is Not defeatable he created everything everything is subject to him well if that's the case then all of that power has been given unto us then why don't we use it why don't we exercise it the the only balancing thing is that Paul was in one place and and there was this lady following around and and was prophesying you know these guys have come to do this and this and this and and but Paul had to wait until he had the word from God it says now you cast it out he couldn't do it right at the beginning he had to wait until God gave him the command to go ahead and to the cast that demon out because it wouldn't have happened before then brother Bradham you're looking to the things that he said when he has a vision all of a sudden no everything has to be in place no this lady has to come in she has to be dressed in certain things she has to take this hat movement from here over to here and she has to take this and push this over here and all of a sudden when all of her things were all is said in places ah now is the time and so then I'll then he spoke the word but it all had to come in the Todd's timing it all had to be the way that God had that God had said so the prophet I mean what I think you like the thinking of David David was fighting the Philistines he went out and fought them one day and and then the the Philistines gathered together again and David says should we go out and fight him he says no not not a direct assault he said go around behind them when you see the wind and the mulberry trees he says then you attack because God had planned God knew what he was doing but we have to listen to him we have to follow his utunction we have to follow his leadership yeah he said what was Jesus manifested for to show God he was God he had to be no man could die or a prophet and no Prophet could he was God he was the god of the prophets he was the prophets he was the he was the Kings he was the history he was all of that and throughout that purpose he achieved a church that he the fullness of God might bring to pass every promised word of God in these last days when he gets the preeminence that means he has to be the leader he has to be the one guiding he has to be the one that inspires you to be able to say the things that he once said if you just say it because you want to say it I mean I could say well let there be snow tomorrow let there be snow tomorrow if that isn't the will of God it won't snow I don't expect snow tomorrow okay but would you see what I'm trying to say but if all of a sudden God anoints me and all of a sudden I call for snow yeah get out your shovels but I mean but you have to understand it has to be God directed brother Bradham just couldn't speak the squirrels into exist as all of a sudden God had to lead him he couldn't give that fish in his life until God has spoke to them he said give that fish back in his life and all of us in the fist you know came back to life again God had to wait for God to lead him and for God to give him the words to say and once that once God had directed him then it was God it wasn't brother Branham speaking well it has to come now in our lives where it's the same thing where it's no longer us doing but oh it's God now doing it through us brother Bradham and the United wins at the end time he goes and he goes into great length he says I have no he says I have no more to do it with than nothing no no I'm no more than just a voice I wasn't the one that appeared down the river I was only standing there when he appeared I'm not the one on the platform these things and foretells these things that happens I as perfect as they are I'm only the one that's near when he does it I was only a voice that he raised that he used to say it it wasn't what I knew is what it's what I just surrendered myself to that he spoke to it isn't me it wasn't the seventh angel oh no it was the manifestation of the Son of God it was the it wasn't the angel his messenger it was it was the mystery that God unfolded it's not a man that's God the angel was not the son of man he was the messenger from the son of man the son of man is Christ he is the one that you're feeding on you're not feeding on it on on a man uh a man with his words his words will fail but you're feeding on the unfailing body word of the son of man that's the message it's not just a man speaking it's not just a Kentucky hillbilly he yielded himself to God and so God could take and speak through him and what was he trying to do to the bride he was trying to encourage the bride except what you are begin to understand this is the man this is the beauty of the god this is the beauty of the message this is the beauty of salvation God is trying to raise us up out of laity and to get us into in Revelations 4 1 come up higher I got some things I want to show you and then and then do without the word has been opened up and to us and every time you begin to read the word all of a sudden oh that's what I am well that's how God does this and we begin to relate that to us and our lives and the things which we are doing and we begin to realize it's not about us it's about God and God is wanting vessels that he can work through and this morning church agency says these elect were these elect were not only the Eternal thoughts of God which were to be expressed in flesh in their due season but these elect are called by another name now to Abraham and his seed were the promises made and he said not two seeds as of many but as of one and to thy seed which is Christ and of ye be Christ then are ye Abraham's seed it heirs according to the promise so we have to be in Christ in order to be Abraham's seed and all the promises being able to relate to us how do you get into Christ by one Spirit we all baptize into the body and into his body without the baptism of the Holy Spirit you're on the outside you are not reborn until you receive the baptism of the Holy Spirit but once you've received the baptism in the Holy Spirit that's when God himself comes and dwells in you and that is the Seal of your salvation because once you are sealed into salvation he says that's it there's no questions any anymore things might happen in your life but he says once God has come into you and sealed you by the baptism in the Holy Spirit from that point on your salvation is secure he said then he goes on not only to narrow it down by Netflix but rather to finalize it for in Galatians 3 he identifies the seed singular with Jesus encounter the seed the children the sea the sea children as children of Promise the promise as having to do with the election or the choosing of God and that is exactly what we have been saying these who are the Royal seed are the elect of God they are the predestinated foreknown of God and were in the mind of God and in his thoughts that's who you are you are far known of God because you were the seed of God because you were the seed of God God knew who you were and God we're looking for you God was always looking for himself only only the elect of God can be redeemed and you're redeemed what does redeem mean being brought back being brought back into your rightful position with God in very plain language the too bright of Christ then in very plain language the true bride of Christ was in the mind of God eternally though not expressed until each came forth in their designated decreed season as each member not as each member came forth it became expressed and took its place in the body thus the bride is the literal spoken word seed bride it's very apparent that she ought to be called that for she was predestinated in him came from the same Source was eternal with him and is now manifesting God in a many-membered body whereas once God was manifested in one member Even in our Lord Jesus Christ so we have to begin and where do we come from what were we always a part of you always were a part of God that is hard to comprehend but it isn't me that I mean this is what the word says this is what brother Brown got us through the prophet is trying to tell us I am a seed of God I always was a seed of God I always was a child of God but now I have to step into the position of being a being that son and when I step into the position of being sin then all the rights and privilege of being a son all of a sudden it it it it comes with it but then I have to be trained I have to be trained how do I use the power how do I use the authority I cannot use it without if I don't have the character so God has to develop in me the character of Jesus Christ and the more of the character of Jesus Christ all of a sudden becomes my character then all of a sudden more and more he can take and he can take the power that is rightfully mined by virtue of who I am and he can take that power and he can let me exercise it this is what he had to do in brother bradham's life this is what he had to do in brother bradham's life in Ministry he had God had to trade him God had to teach him in fact there was one incident where he was sitting there before he had the spoken word all of a sudden a couple of kids came in and they were sitting on the front row and they started making love in front of everybody and brother Ram says don't do that he costed him two or three times and all of a sudden and God spoke to him and said whatever you say that's what's going to happen and there's a pause brother Brown says I forgive you for that because he could have smitten them blind he could have smitten them dead in fact got it the angel had told him but previously he said he said there's a trap that Satan has laid out for you button wouldn't tell him what it was well that was the Trap and God was trying to God God knew how brother Brandon was going to act okay but he had to prove to brother Branham that you have the character of Jesus Christ in you and therefore you will not act Accord act in ways which are not according to God's purpose and will so God has to develop in us the character he cannot trust us with he cannot trust us with the power until all you know until we have the character you don't take a three-year-old and give him your 44 magnum and said they're here son go have some fun I mean you know no you have to train him okay well God can do can't give us all the power that's rightfully ours until we have been adequately trained until we actually know how to know what to do with the power that is rightfully ours he said he said now then we're coming to a conclusion as the Eternal logos God was manifested in the son and then Jesus dwelt all the fullness of the godhead bodily and that Eternal one was the father manifested in flesh and thereby gained the title of son so he's talking about Jesus Christ he was he was a part of God he was the fullness of the God and all that stuff then he goes on even so we so he's taking what Jesus Christ was and now he's relaying that to us even so we Eternal in his thoughts just as Christ was in our turn became the many membered spoken word seed manifested in flesh and those Eternal thoughts now manifest In the Flesh are the sons of God even as we are so called we did not become seed by the rebirth we were seed and therefore were reborn for only the elect can be reborn because we were seed is the reason we could be quick and in non-seed there's nothing to Quicken why do you believe the message because God's seed was there God took that seed and he quickened it he brought it to life and over the over the course of your life he's been taking you and molding you and making you but he's bringing us to this a time now when the seed that was put in us has to come to full manifestation has to come to full maturity this is the bride age this is where Jesus Christ is going to come and so live in the bride until we literally we become the manifestation of God himself and we think well how will I act well look at the prophet how did he act he was still brother Branham he still liked to hunt he still like to fish he still liked a joke he still like to have fun he still like to do okay but then when God needed him he was there well we are we are what we are I mean my personality enters into everything I preach okay I can't help it that's just who I am okay but I have a some at least in India they say I have a way of making something so simple they can everybody can understand it well I hope that's true but but we have to come down to the place we are still us but when God wants to use us if we can yield ourselves to him in spite of our Humanity then God can begin to work through us and God can begin to manifest himself to us why would I speak that to that girl I said don't look at the stupidity of the ACT but look at her look at her give her her life back that was God speaking through me to her God gave her her life because I was the spoken word to her and I was in a miserable Miss I mean my mental everything no I was not the one you wanted to have pray for me at that time I mean I was mad I was upset I was frustrated okay All of My Flesh was there but God looked past all of that he managed in spite of all of that he managed to go ahead and and and take me and actually even in that state he he was able actually to speak through me and give life to that child so it doesn't matter your mental state you don't have to be super spiritual you don't have to be living with angels and flying around in heaven no you you just you but if you can take you and give it to God and let God use you he will do things through you that you could not even begin to imagine he said now then we're coming to a conclusion as Eternal logos God was manifesting the son and and and Jesus throughout all the fullness of the godhead bodily and that Eternal one was the father manifested in flesh and thereby again I guess I read that yeah so hold this carefully in mind he says now take the next step redeem means to buy back it restores to the original owner God by his death he the shed blood he brought back his own he brought back the first spoken word seed bride my sheep hear my voice and they follow me you always worship you never were a pig or a dog turned into a sheep that's impossible for every kind of Life produced of the same kind and there's no change in species as we were in the thoughts of God and then ex and then expressed in flesh there had to come a time a day when we would hear his voice the word and hearing that voice become aware of our father calling us and recognize that we are sons of God so we've heard it through the prophet but now it has to become a reality and that's where that's where the problem comes I'm told that when you take when you take an engineer and he goes to a to a new to a new business sometimes they will give them a project which um nobody else has been able to solve because they weren't told it can't be solved so they'll work on it and they'll work on it and they'll come up with an answer when all the other people couldn't why because you work you you you weren't told that it can't be to be solved you weren't told that it was impossible well God will take us and me we might think well this is impossible but when you're relying upon yourself yeah it is but if you look to God and begin to realize you have the answer and then God directs I know this one brother he works and he does metal fabricating and all of a sudden there was a problem came in the guy wanted something fabricated and he thought and he thought and he thought and finally he just kind of gave up and he went to you know went home went to bed and then at night all of a sudden if weenie wakes up in the morning that's how to do it then he goes back to the shop and all of a sudden they tell them yeah why didn't we think of that that's so simple but here again he had to get away from himself and he had to simmer himself down so God could speak and often that's the way it is in our lives we have to let God in we have to let his thoughts become our thought we have we have to let him guide and direction so that we can do the things that that he wants done and the God who is rich in Mercy says I'm only saying this not to mix up Doctrine but just straighten it out that we might get away from this fear and despair you don't know who you are you are not going to be but now you are the sons of God so you always were sons of God when God had you in his thinking at the beginning you have to be some part of you your life that's in you now had to be with God and from in the beginning in one place we we talk about faith and brother Branham uses his example and I've used it a few times overseas brother Branham talks about we have to come up to having Supreme faith and we talk about faith as one thing Supreme oh my how are we going to have Supreme faith and brother Brown says uh we'll all paraphrase he says if you have a car you go out and take the key stick it in the ignition turn it you expect it to start because it always starts there's no question well it's going to start because it always starts you walk into a room and it's dark you really feel around flip on the light switch you expect light it always comes right there's no question there's no frustrating you don't call up your pastor I'm going to turn on my lights I'm going to turn on my lights pray pray pray pray no you just go and flip the light switch and then you go on which business now that's the way it has to be with us and God where there's no question well God your word said so so it has to be okay we accept it we prayed we accepted okay God now it's Europe you you are obligated to your word brother Brown says that you're not obligated to me you're obligated to your word so if I take your word and and I sit there and I remind you of your word and I claim that promise that you've given in your word then now you're under under obligation to fulfill your word in my life and then we place it on him sure he can do whatever he wants he may not do it the right then but he will because he said he would I mean there's no question here but see this is where we have this is where brother Bradham raced in his life he had a vision that was the end of the argument he knew it's going to happen because God gave him the vision and he always knew the Visions never failed then when he got to the place where of discernment he could look in the pack in their life he could look for me if God would show them the future he could see them doing the things that they normally would do as a child or whatever the situation is and he knew God had healed him and others he says now according to your faith and you know it's it's interesting with healing some people had followed had followed Jesus Christ to where he was staying I think they were lepers that could have been blind I forget which one it was and finally they hate brother Jesus Christ everybody says do you believe I can do this well yeah we believe you can do that he said in according to your faith that's what you can receive and they went they went away and all of a sudden according to their faith they were healed and you know that is the only stipulation there's no other stipulation it isn't how often you go to church do you pay your tithes you do this and this and this and this this this no do you believe it if you can believe it I will do it it's that simple we make it difficult we make it complicated it's not it's the Simplicity of the Gospel it's the Simplicity of taking God at his word and believing whatever God has said that is what God will do because he's God he cannot lie that's one thing he cannot do he cannot lie and once he's in once he's made a promise then he's obligated to that promise he's obligated to do what his word says he would do and that's where we have to come in our relationship I know I personally I know that I'm a son of God 's revealed that to me I don't doubt that I don't question that because God revealed that to me I know I am the righteousness of God himself because the word says I am okay do I have faults and failures you betcha but am I the righteousness of God I sure am in the eyes of God that's how I stand there's no question on that because that's what the word declares that I am I know that I am a sinless before God why because I am in Christ Christ doesn't God doesn't see me he sees the sacrifice because he looks at the sacrifice he has to declare me righteous he has to declare me sinless because the sacrifice with the propitiation for my sins and therefore I before God I am sinless before God I am righteous because he says that I am and is merely taking him at his word and and believing it now if you believe that you will live like it okay you can't say you know I am the righteousness of God and you go out there the beer joints and all the other kind of stuff and sin and living no no no no if there's no conversion if there's no change in life there is no conversion but once you've accepted Jesus Christ as your savior and once you realize the magnitude of the love that he expressed to you at Calvary then you will respond in love you know it's interesting when somebody asks asked um they ask Jesus Christ what is the greatest of all the Commandments Jesus says well that's simple you love God with your whole heart soul mind body and spirit and the same is like unto the same you'll love your neighbor as yourself and these two Commandments rest all the laws and the prophets and this message what is the message love God with everything that's within you fall in love so I'm in love with him and and him until you're willing to do everything that he says and everything he guides and everything directs because if you love him and you love your neighbors yourself he says you've already fulfilled all the laws and the Commandments and from that point on then God can begin to lead you and he can begin to guide you and he can begin to to to to to to to direct direct your lives the people the people that were that came out of Egypt God performed miracles God showed his mighty hand he brought plagues upon Egypt so that they could see this is who I am I am God and there's nothing can stand before me he went they came into Mount Sinai Mighty manifestation of God Thunders and Lightnings and earthquakes and voice of God sounded like a trumpet and everybody's ran because they were scared and God why did God do that God did that so that they would fear Him and out of fear they would they would they would keep his law fear is a very poor motivator why don't we go 80 miles an hour down the freeway because these are guys with blue lights and they don't like you going 80 miles an hour down the freeway so they will stop you and they will give you a little citation and it'll cost you a few things okay but if if when God shows his love to you and then God himself comes and lives inside of you he changes your nature we are not under law we are under Grace Grace does not give us a license to sin Grace gives us the freedom to worship because under grace we can open up our hearts to God we can sit there and enter into his presence because we know that we are the very righteousness of God himself because we are in Jesus Christ and because we love him we automatically will do the things that he's wanting for us to do and he and under the New Covenant he says I'm going to take my law and put it in their hearts and in their minds basically we will take on the very nature of God himself We Will We Will obey it because it's our nature to do so we will be we will obey God because of the love that we have for him and so love is a greater motivator than anything else we could have why why does the husband love their wives why are they say truthful to their to their wives and vice versa because it's the love bond between you that keeps you the way that you are well it's our love relationship with Jesus Christ he says if you love me you'll do the things that I ask you to do not out of a demand not out of if you don't do this I'm going to you know brother because here again if we if we can fall in love with Jesus Christ where he literally becomes the focus of Our Lives where we love him more than we love life itself and we we would want we would not want to do anything that he would find offensive then all of a sudden we will live a life of Holiness we will live a life of Purity we will do the things which we which we are expected to do as Christians not because of law but out of love God bless you thank you God bless you yes yes we're just resting amen let's stand to our feet and Worship the Lord was speaking all
