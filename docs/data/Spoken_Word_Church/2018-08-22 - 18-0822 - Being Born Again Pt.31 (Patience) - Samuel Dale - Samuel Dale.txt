if you'd like turning you scriptures turn where we've been reading from 1st Peter 1:22 23 and then we into 2nd Peter 1 1 through about seven Karen I thought just keep on going is into the stature of a perfect man and pray and hope that it's you know helps each and every one of us to understand you may we have a sad disappointment to say tonight because the Lord willing this coming weekend brother John and sister Maya's gonna be moving back up for genja way so we don't want you know I had a talk with their pastor when I was up at Ruth and I told him we wouldn't trying to win them over well we ain't trying to run them off trying to do neither one that's they're they're doing but you know they're leaving the Lord willing after we would have kind of like a thing we should have planned it and everybody just forgot it cuz it come up so quick we couldn't had a dinner or something like that but we did get to take them out to eat last night and everything for supper and you know hope they enjoyed that and and knowing that we do love them and like I said we we're not trying to run them off we're not trying to win them up we're trying to have the Lord to do his way and what he desires for them to do and he'll work it out it'll it'll do but we certainly have enjoyed the time that we've had with her fellowshipping with us you know so you make sure and tell them reason I'm saying it tonight we'll say it again Sunday morning but make sure you you're not gonna be here something with them that you shake their hand a night and tell them you in Jordan being here because we try to be friendly try to that's one thing they said it was nice about us and I said well we did have been a few places sometimes back years ago when I was at one time I've told you about it and and I actually was the preacher and I shook hands with one person out of the congregation and that was the only one out of the whole thing while I saying I was the preacher you know in the visiting of preacher and all but I came home raising Cain about telling the people to be friendly and that's what we need to be but just tell them how much you appreciate them being with us and and having a good time fellowshipping together and they will be coming back together with us and fellowship you know all right then we'll get into a scripture father we thank you for your grace in your lovin to each and every one of us and we pray that you would just guide us Lord and help us to understand you in your under ways and things of doing Lord and we know without you there is no hopes in any of us but we pray that you would just bless and guide each one be with those that are sick we were really digging our lord and knowing that he's still having problems and just reach down and touch each one there's many among us that are sick many sicknesses and things that Lord we believe your word that by your stripes were healed and we pray that you would just help us to follow there in until it becomes a manifestation we love you and we think you got us now as we read your word you come and speak to our hearts in Jesus name Amen 1st Peter 1:22 seeing you have purified your souls and obeying the truth through the spirit unto unfeigned love of the Brethren see that you love one another with a pure heart fervently being born again not a corruptible seed but of incorruptible by the Word of and how are you born in by the Word of God which liveth and abideth for ever on so now we'll go over to pick up in our thought into the statue of a perfect man in chapter 2 verse 1 Simon Peter is servant an apostle of Jesus Christ to them that have obtained like precious faith with us through the righteousness of God and our Savior Jesus Christ grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord according as his divine divine power had given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness has it done now through the knowledge of him that have called us to glory and virtue so remember we are called to these all right whereby we are given whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these you might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust and beside this giving all diligence add to your faith virtue and to virtue knowledge and to knowledge temperance and to temperance patience and to patience godliness and to godliness brotherly kindness and to brotherly kindness charity amen and you may be seated the Lord had his blessing to the reading of the word now we didn't give out any new notes tonight because you've had them Sunday so if you got him you got the notes of what we were doing Sunday and they have that in there on the system of doing what now what are we talking about background a little bit especially to you know the new ones that's not been with us and and everything - to not just leave you dangling and wondering we've been speaking for probably now about four months or three or four or five on the stature of a perfect man all right and you'd say well you know I agreed that book in an hour well I wanna read it and look unless but that don't do no good it's whether or not you understand what's being all right and and that's the point and the statue of a perfect man I've tried to get you to see is not just a message of telling us you know this and that or the other about Christianity it goes all the way from the new birth because you've got to like the scripture says do that you know with of like precious faith all right the born-again experience is like precious faith all the way back to the book of Acts all is like precious faith the new birth all right but then the growth development of Christianity was kind of eaten away by you bugs through the dark ages and the things the caterpillar cankerworm and all and it left the church standing on the basis of the new birth in the book I mean in the point of of Luther Wesley and starting over there and but it's I will restore so it was coming forth to bring forth that church again to back to the faith of the fathers all right so it's the statue of a perfect man is the faith of the fathers and it starts by the new birth the Prophet says how faith and be born again and then these are the things that God expects us to add all right so it's not something that we just say well you know well yeah we're Christians would I don't understand brother Dale coughs you know we're Christians we we go to church we do this all right why did your prophet say he said to the Pentecostal people he said that's where you made you biggest mistake he's because you thought you got everything and he said you didn't he said you just come to a place to start all right see because the statue of a perfect man is teaching us a growth development in Christianity it's not to just a good thought or a good message or something the prophet priest it's telling us those things because that's what I've emphasized over and over to you about these things and the Prophet said it's a requirement that we have it this day this time because we believe that the the restoration of the word has come all right and with that restoration of the word it will come to the point that we can see Jesus Christ now in the word you know unveiled unto us and we can walk then into that and what is going to bring a rapture haven't you ever thought about we've been here almost 50 years now just the going of the Prophet I mean what is gonna bring the rapture are we gonna just wire out or what's gonna be you know well I'm waiting on this well okay praise God if that takes place but what if it don't take place well it's the word well there's a lot out there right now this going off the field and going out into the world and back slid that was screaming and hollering for 40 years that they believed every word the prophet said so let's just don't be in that crowd we need to be in the crowd that's fully dedicated no matter what you're looking forward to I don't care what you're expecting I don't care if it's a woman in the White House or if it's return ministries or what it is I don't care what it is if you're expecting I'm trying to be set for where we are right now because that's not going to take place if you and I are not into the word if we're not in the word it's gonna take place and we'll miss it anyway I'm all I'm trying to do is get us to the point that we've got to be as my old faithful saying is what don't go down to the bus depot to try to catch a train now you've heard that for 40 years right you get where the bus is supposed to be so if you say well this is what we're expecting alright be in line be it set for that to to where that we can walk into that and see what's going on all right because see we don't want to think about maybe this day but Hebrews 11 40s is they without us all back behind us cannot be made perfect without us we'll get to that more Sunday into the understanding but church it's in the Bible the day without us could not be made perfect alright they're waiting the Prophet said on you and I well is that true then well all I'm trying to do is just give you a nod to the place to where that we can be fulfilling what they're waiting on what else could we be looking for you regardless of what you call it returns or what you call it anything whatever it be and we've got to be ready see that's all I've ever hollered to screamed at you about and I know it puts you to place it makes people not understand but to get into this situation I've been in four for three or four months and then you tell me I don't understand what brother Dale's talking about well I certainly certainly said it over and over and over enough in the past three or four months you're at least know what I believe about the new birth you ought to know what I believe about the statue of a perfect man you ought to know what I believe and what I'm expecting because I put it in just about every service and everything and if it is true that they without us well you know what they're saying how long right no no no brother Dale I know the message because how long how long is a this sealed you yeah you don't know brother runs message he's the one that tells you how long and he's one it takes you beyond the curtain of time to that group of people over there that's saying how long and that ain't feels seal Jews that he went to see beyond the curtain time and they're saying how long because they're waiting on you and I to come to that place all right now I hope you caught our Sunday I want to repeat this because I want you to see what I believe I believe these virtues our requirement or why would God put it in his word it's required for somebody might not be me or you but it's required for somebody because this is the age of the full requirement of all things to end it all up all right so it's required uh somebody well why can't we believe where those people if not who's going to be yet we're just not putting our confidence and part into listening to what the prophet has to say we're putting it in what we think he said well none that we thinks that don't I won't do no good it'll be what God vindicates you remember what we were talking about this past Sunday you realize if it's right what your prophet had to say that's an odd way of saying it to people and people are claimed to be following the manatees if it's right that's this point that's the plain language to you if it's right do you believe what he taught is the truth within its right so do you believe the Bible that is right so the Bible said without us they cannot be made perfect so now what are you expecting I lived that brother what was his name was it wouldn't brother Theo was it they preached that message anyhow he said the name Jesus and and he took it and he said see if you take us out of Jesus said you just got Jess but to put us into it you got Jesus so that's that's a good thought we need to dwell on Jesus all right now listen do you realize like I said if you believe it I hope the brothers can start with these because they're they don't have no new notes I just left them with these but I didn't explain it to them so I hope they'll follow along with go to number 1 which is statue of a perfect man which is you know paragraph and the main thing is paragraph 354 all right and watch what's what your prophet says but each age God has placed these things into his church and pattered it by showing that each individual has these possesses these qualities and this being when it's completed now listen to what he's saying is the Church of God going to rapture now this that's the church that's the whole that's all the church the bride right all right now look what he says and this being when is completed is a servant of God in the Church of God that's going into rapture you see what I mean now so do you realize that I made the statement Sunday do you realize that if somebody doesn't does not attain unto these virtues and come out to the position to where it's supposed to be there will never be a rapture the rapture is waiting on a group of people no you said well why don't know we'll come on read read some times but read without getting your intellectual thoughts in your mind and get it already figured out before you ever read is that what he said did he say that the church is waiting on these things to be brought into being to bring a rapture all right no then did he say the individual see when he's completed he's gonna be the one to go in the rapture no I've said a lot of things and I know I leave dangling places and things and I'm sorry cuz it like I said if you if you can't go back and listen to the messages and think and listen to what I say then you're just trying to argue points and you've got some petty P the idea of your own so go ahead but listen Lutheran Wesley Azusa Street they did not have these virtues right they didn't have these virtues because they did well the prophet has to preach it to us to the town where he was and why would he say that that's what God is expecting us to have we see Lutheran Westland is going in the rapture yeah they're going to go in a change of the body yeah but they're not going to be the ones standing at the moment of the twinkling of an eye that's what I was trying to get across to you Sunday you couldn't take Martin Luther them put them up here where we are move us back where they are and this thing take place it's waiting on somebody that can come to these isn't if somebody don't come to these verses and it doesn't have to be the one person so Enoch was only one walked off but think about it they wouldn't be no rapture now what's he meaning there wouldn't be a rapture what's he meaning the church going to rapture you've got to have we got to have these virtues to go in out of change at the moment in the twinkling of an eye right Luther and Westland Pentecost didn't have these virtues right because if he did now where's your restoration so you say well I think maybe they may have had it back there they didn't have it why was your prophet call them babies but yet he said they were born-again Christians why would he tell us who the street Pentecostal people their mistake was facto thinking they had everything he said when you just got to the beginning of starting did you say the latter Ryan he said you ain't even had to form a reign yet he was rough on those people but he was telling the truth so you see the Lutheran Western him couldn't come to a place to be changed in a moment weakling life but somebody's going to do that why can't we believe we're part of it if not we floated out all these years for so for no reason whatsoever I'd be like training for war and then sit down and say well y'all go ahead I won't say can wait up but it's not going to be a rapture unless somebody attains to these virtues then I don't think that well then what do you think you got the pulpit men women children whatever if you can express to me what can take us to a change of these bodies the pulpit is open to you women and all we know everything clean for well then we'll let you stand out and from the pulpit or we'll let you write it down on a piece of paper hand it in anything you want to go do you see Church we're getting too old you realize a lot of us sitting in this building today a 10-year period it's gonna be a wipeout of a lot of people here come on and besides in that ten-year period it'd be probably more died than ever that are not an old age they did a lot of us Rolaids here we better start getting concerned right but what about now that's what is waiting the rapture is waiting up on oh no brother Dale we've all preached here I know it and I don't make ridicule nobody what everybody's looking for that life seed everybody looking for that life seat thank God praise God glory hallelujah but I didn't know finding the life seed was gonna make us a change I thought we hadn't got to reading all of it yet I've asked you to read the statue of perfect man how about going on our reading worries about yes and this and this and then it finally comes to a ministry just like Jesus Christ did the Prophet teach you that one they'd have to be a ministry just like Jesus oh that was brother Branham thank God amen glory hallelujah we know that was right but you know he ain't all of it because if it's right according to the scripture says they without us and us means at least to I'm not degrading nobody I'm just trying to be plain to where you listen what is your hope build on what about somebody standing up and telling you there ain't going to be no rap certain less we have these virtues well you know what everybody ought to do there to fall on their knees and start praying for these virtues I asked you to start with I said are you serious about your experience do you know you're born again because the born-again experience is just the beginning of the statue of a perfect man of faith the new birth it's just the beginning I serious are we what was the next one that we brought go ahead Russian paragraph 367 and once you get it these people who died in here are depending and waiting on us so this church has got to come to perfection in order to bring the resurrection no any time do you need for us to read that what did he say they're depending and waiting on us so this church has got to come to perfection we're still arguing over five Matthew 5:48 what being perfect means well I think it means you I think it means that and I'll tell you up front Matthew 5:48 has nothing to do with the fact or trying to have bad good you are it doesn't have anything to do how good you are we'll get to that wing and finishing the message but listen and they're listened and they're under souls under the altar waiting for this church to come to its perfection that when Christ does come in this church you see is coming smaller in the minority pyramid coming up right refers to the chart board drawing it's a whole lot sharper than that but just like to write that cross Darcy it's come up to a needle point until the church in the minority has got to get into a place until it's the same kind of ministry that lists left because when this headstone comes what Liam got up to the headstone talking about it yet how but now we're saying that's what I say in Sunday was weren't you listening I figured somebody nailed my hide when I went outside are you trying to say there's nothing to be no rapture not these virtues that's what the Prophet said are you going to say they ain't gonna be no resurrection without somebody with these verse what's your prophet said have I become your enemy because I tell you the truth I've tried my best to get the truth to all of us to look at it if the prophet said its requirement then alright let's get at it alright then we come to the basin and said okay now if it's necessary we have these virtues how do we get them tribulation worketh patience so take my belt out come on look line up I don't think that's what it's talking about see that's that word definition things that we read and that's what I've tried to get you to see about the stature of a perfect man virtue the Prophet said is not to live a virgin life you know to be a virgin he's given us Holy Ghost revelation understanding of what the meaning of the word virtue is it's not to just try to be a know you know to be a virgin he says that's not what it is in this case he says he said that's nothing then we got on over to temperance on the last message and what about temperance temperance he said is not just stop drinking alcohol he said not in this case another what I liked is what he said in it he didn't just say the controlling temper he said to controlling that tattling tongue you need to read that again he said to control that tattling tongue what's tattling tongue got to do with difference it must have something to do with it because he's the one who said it you need to reread it again what you see we take words and try to understand a prophet is giving you by revelation what the meaning of those words are irregardless of how they spelled and our natural way of understanding it the natural way of understanding virtue is a virgin our natural way of understanding temperance is to not drink alcohol and in the statute of perfect man the Prophet says that has nothing to do with it where do we get it maybe Sunday when we get up there to where the Prophet said we've come all this way ain't got to holding those yet we got a long ways but trying to get us to the place to work what the Prophet says is what it is he's the one that says it right - how temperance and the things What did he say let's see temperance doesn't mean stop drinking alcohol here either in other words here in this message either it's the that's getting the glasses temperance doesn't mean stop drinking alcohol here either no no temperance doesn't mean alcohol cure not in this case this is Bible temperance holy spirit temperance that's just one of the lusts of the flesh we're talking about Holy Spirit temperance see we don't need temperance of the natural I the new birth order took care of the alcohol right the new birth in the Baptist or - took care of drinking alcohol you see well I had a new burden the Baptist but I still drink I don't I ain't going arguing I won't just say that ain't according to Bible terminology Bible terminology don't not even be thought of like that Bible terminology or to be to the point that when the Holy Ghost comes in the devil goes out if the devil goes out his liquor goes with him well we didn't know it was wrong car come on don't be silly with me I'm too old I'm 78 years old that don't I don't make no sense for me to say we didn't understand it was wrong you didn't understand it was wrong to commit adultery when you had the new birth in the Baptist or Patera Presbyterian or Pentecostals I'm just gonna tell it to where it is we didn't have it that's the reason we had trouble with things is that solved it enough I'm playing I know it but I ain't gonna play ain't gonna be no blood on my hands wouldn't we get out of here you ain't gonna be what brother Dale didn't tell us yeah it's gonna be I'm gonna tell ya care what it calls it scopes my life so far so I'm gonna put it on it you see Church why would the Bible why would it be a statue of a perfect man if that was not the key to it all and what is your prophet say on the stache on about the statue of a perfect man on 327 Church age book this messenger Malachi for Luke 17 32 do two things turn the hearts of the children back to the faith of the Father and reveal the seven thunders which is a revelation contained in the seven seals and it'll be these divinely revealed mystery truth that literally turn us back so you want to be turned back to the faith of the father we got to get into the seal the thunders we don't need to know this underscores we might get confused and only the Prophet you watch the thunders work that's how great we go when he was out there 1963 everybody said that was the coming of the Lord well there was only one man in the world and understood the coming of the Lord in 63 and that was brother Branham out in the desert nobody else understood it so if that was the coming of the Lord then you missed it come on why don't we get playing people say well the Lord come to 63 Lord come to 63 where's he at that's what they told me when the first coming the message said you can't be saved because the redemption was over to 63 that's what your preachers preach it you know what I told I said according to my Bible and the Prophet I've studied so far on as much as I can I come to find out that Redemption was old for the Foundation's world so they kind of knew whether of the Prophet was in 63 in Arizona why did they attack that so much why did they attack him as being at the wrong date because if they can destroy the wrong date they can destroy what God done in Arizona to start him and what did he do there come on you show me I'll show you what he said you showed me where anything was told him in Arizona because you're gonna have to buy the one quote I'm gonna bring where the angel told him should go back to Jeffersonville those angels said it'll be told you what to do ix our he come back to Jeffersonville he said I don't know what the first seal is did the Angels tell him out there what the first seal was if they did and he come back he's a liar and we're fun too were found following a false prophet no in the knife three got to steal number one he said I don't know what steal number two hit but he knew everything no he didn't know everything he did he lied you can't go that away I'm sorry I'm just - blowing I know it that's maybe I need to get me a greeters at Walmart you know what I mean by that I have what we make a living and forget it no I can't do it the code I done spent my life fighting for this thing and ain't nothing gonna keep me from going with it because it's in him anyway if not in me all right listen he goes to blasphemous names and starts talking about temperance and he says there's two different kinds of faith there's two different kinds of virtue two different kinds of knowledge two different kind of temperance and he said now that's the same point is right here see one thinks it's prohibition but that ain't the kind of temperance that God is talking about it's that uncontrolled ungodly uncontrollable temper you got in things and that's what he said about what you see that's where you you're not gonna take what he says one way or the other somewhere down the line we're gonna fall off right because we can't keep going now I'm trying to tell you what's happening and you're not gonna listen to it and you're not gonna take it to heart all these years all them people falling away they had to come up to be somewhere before they could fall because the Bible says that that they'll come a falling away well you can't fall off the house until you get on top of it all right so you can see all these years at all them people spent coming to the message and hollering about it and believe in it and spending their money and doing and traveling the world in it and look at him now falling away why because things didn't go the way they thought it ought to go that right you tell me any other good answer to it things didn't go the way they didn't they wanted it to go on it they fell away well what do you think is gonna happen to the rest of us yeah I'm sorry Church I'm not sorry for the truth I'm just sorry for the fact that I've tried to screamed and hollered and I don't I don't mean to say I don't get respect now that's because this man don't need no respect this man has always walked on his own when others went after all the other doctrines and I'm telling you plain you come and let's talk I had the opportunity to go and be with these doctrines the toothed old man invited me to come to his church I said I can't come I got a job I have to work for a living but I said there's one thing for certain I don't see what you're talking about and but I'm not saying you're wrong I'm just saying I don't see it so you pray for me and I'll pray for you I had to change to be in all of those things but now I've walked alone on one thing this message is right I don't care what we think about it if I miss it and die and go to hell I'll be in Hell happy about it because I'll know for sure this message is right they don't have to be interpreted it don't have to have nobody to pick it up and prop it up or do anything with it it's right if we ever get that settled in when the Prophet said something we won't argue about what he's saying you know what I mean we won't take our own concepts and thoughts he said they're two different kind of faith he said one of the nature given to never kind of virtue knowledge temperance patience no the one of them is natural things there's good people in this world you work with somebody around somebody something and you know they're just as nice as they can be just make us blo ashamed of ourselves for being nice right but there's two different kind one of them is the nature given the other one is a Holy Ghost given by the new birth but listen after he comes to virtue knowledge temperance I want to get this little bit until night anyway he comes to patience faith virtue knowledge temperance patience now what is patience well that's just being patient nice that's good I mean that's that's a commendable straight answer but what is patience that's to believe guards when it's all when it's impossible to be ever to be true that's the best way I can say it is to believe God to know that it'll take place when it's totally impossible we know it's impossible there's no way it could ever be the way we've got it figured out but yet God can take care of him and what did brethren say the first patience would need he said patience with God right he said when God tells us something and we wait on it I believe this message is the word of God right I believe this message is God's Word all right and I believe this message is telling us what God wants us to know about ourselves so we put it all on knowing about God and that's good but then he turns around and puts it all back trying to get us to see who we are what you see you try to preach something and people to just sign up on it and if they don't understand it and they well I just can't understand what he's talking about why talking today with somebody about why is it so much in the Bible about the son of man when the Prophet said even Jesus never called himself son of God so he called herself son of man now there is one quote come on I can quote we there is one quote where he talks about him call so you say he never called himself son of God Cinci right there he did but the major of son of man is what it is why do you know what a son of man means you realize son of man means the Word of God made flesh that's the son of man it has a greater meaning than that brother Branham was not the son of man he was a son of man revealing the Son of Man the Son of Man is the Lord Jesus Christ but when Christ comes into his church - now I'll use this word perfect until Sunday when he comes into his church in perfect form or complete brother Branham calls the bride the son of man the Bible calls earthy Son of Man if you don't believe it go in revelation 1 and read it one standing in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks like unto the Son of Man Girt about the paps for the golden girdle he said that ain't no fit no masculine man that's a feminist he said that's a bride of Jesus Christ but you know what I've been trying to have patience with people to get them to see do you know that when I first preached this bride of Jesus Christ would be the word made flesh in the end time was in 1969 in Athens Georgia it's what I thought the first sermon I preached in this mess I still got the notes in my Bible you say you've been sarcastic no telling the truth because God showed me the quotes of the Prophet that the bride would be the word made flesh Jesus Christ was not a second person he was not a son of man Jesus Christ was the son of man right the bride is not to be a son of man she is to be the son of man made word flesh in this day that's what's going to bring a change could you think I'm just playing with the word because listen they ain't gonna be a rapture unless somebody has gets these virtues did you follow that one what did you follow the next one that the Prophet said no resurrection remember that without these virtues there'll be no resurrection why because according to my Bible the dead in Christ shall rise first and we which are alive and remain she'll be changed in a moment of twinkling high so we're not looking for a rapture right now we're looking for a resurrection why is it that your prophet would stand at a situation a position and he said bring me what was it 24 was it 24 cases was it 14 bring me in 24 I thought he said bring me 24 your worst cases and he said I'll guarantee you healing for them all now who could stand in that place ain't no need of you thinking you can and I sure flat ain't thinking about being it cuz it ain't gonna work with me and I ain't even gonna try it you know what I found out by listening that was in the early part of brother Brendan's ministry that he was trying to nail that thing down and that's why he said it God gave him the right to say it because it was nailing down his ministry putting it perfectly in order for the scripture do you know what son of man really is I come on church I'm sorry we studied this in the Baptist Church the son of man is the resurrection the son of man is the resurrection that's why brother Branham could stand and say God guarantee you healing there was nothing could stand before that man that God told him to speak it you agree why because I was the resurrection why did they have to go forth as a healing campaign according to Mel Akkad had to be the son of righteousness rising here in his wing it went for it with a healing campaign why because the son of man the Lord Jesus Christ came to visit you and I to a little man called William Branham the difference between him was the flesh now that's the best for him to say it the difference was the flesh because he his flesh was not perfect or complete it wasn't virgin-born it wouldn't work and even the Lord Jesus Christ himself the son of man his body had to be redeemed but not because it was sinful but because it had a beginning come on Church I'm sorry what was you at you said well brother Lu you've talked about these things of the Son of Man back in 69 come on church a dis come out of the bad mister we've we taught the son of man is the resurrection that is it you want to get in the Bible and take the son of man and just go scripture after scripture after scripture you see that the Lord Jesus Christ was the son of man and he had the resurrection he saw week what did he say he said I am the resurrection and the life no brother Branham couldn't say that because he wasn't the resurrection and the life but he had the authority to use the name and he would stand there sell guarantee you healing because he had contact with their son of man do you see what I'm talking about without these virtues there's not going to be a resurrection because you're not gonna come to the Son of man anytime you want to sit down and read a while save and just run ups on a man in the computer just run it up they won't go that far anytime you want it you come to me and we'll shut down the run I'll let you just take my Bible and write down because I wrote them down along that b69 how many years is that for next year would be 40 years 50 year next year will be 50 years and I could I said was the first sermon I preached in 1969 or the Mansfield went some words and wanted me to minister because I saw then what it was see the resurrection I thought now come on now listen am i quoting brother Branham where's the resurrection and thank you sister she said it's in here I thought that's where the Prophet said it was a he said the resurrection is inside of you in your spirit now that's not in your human reasoning memory conscious affection no it's in the Holy Spirit that's inside of you your resurrection is inside of you all it's doing is waiting on us to come to the basis that we can believe it that we can speak it and move forward but we've had to have patience we'll get to it when we get on to the next messenger so we're brethren said they said to him said how can you do it brother Branham how can you put up with this need nine too few of the big church name Joe he said faith to believe that it's in their heart and patience virtue and not to believe that it's in their heart I have nothing against this people right over here this church sitting there here beside of us I know in their heart and I know that that's the reason the people this message are not going to take the message but really what it is because in their heart they can't see it I mean you're talking to a bunch of baby Pentecostal people for the random was talking to a bunch of babies and he said if they don't understand he said how you going to get it what does that quote if they did in other words if you can't teach them Pentecostal times he said what can you do with the deeper things another word think of all he was doing and he would go to those meetings and cry out and God would come so present until he would just tell him you call it and that's it he's dead over here they'll be dead the healing called it that's the way it'll be and yet he knew standing there they wouldn't nobody seeing what he was talking about what about it do we see what he was talking about that these virtues are required for us to make a change these virtues are required for us to come in a resurrection but are we gonna raise up and and meet the challenge or the hour are we gonna be like everything else cuz there's two ways of going you can slip out the door ain't mean enough to build Endora but I mean you can slip out and go with others and just follow all these lines with all these people you know that's turned against the message now you can go with them and say well I don't know profit he said so-and-so but I don't believe that okay between you and God as to what your answer will be if I told you and you believed it you know you really believed me and I told you tonight I want to give everybody in this building a million dollars and I want to meet you at the bank tomorrow at ten o'clock Thomas Becker just dying laughing because he knows where he'd be at ten o'clock he wouldn't be sitting listening to a teacher cause his mom and daddy would be sitting at the bank and he'd have a perfect right to being out of school that day a million dollars worth let's see you know for certain that if I told you that I would have to have that back up to do it or I wouldn't tell you right but you know true that if I told you it'd be there you got that much confidence in me as a human being that I would do all I could well how much more confidence should we have in God who has given us everything there's nothing that we like that's why I keep emphasizing 3:27 church age book he's give us the way to come to the stature of a perfect man because it'd be these two finally reveal mystery truth that literally turns back but people don't want to read nothing about the thunders or the the seals or the 70 weeks of Daniel or this that it is no they don't they're afraid of it what are you afraid of well I don't understand it well that's no problem but if you won't make it available and they're a big problem at least we could read a lot no problem with people that are well read because there's one thing for certain when I make a quote I can look at your face and tell whether or not you've ever read that because your face will turn you know you're green or something you said yeah I've read that well thank God what do you see God made a requirement for us to have these virtues it has to be made away where we can receive it it's hard for me to stay away cuz I got the notes laying there it was hard for me to stay away from gardening and so study that one first till Sunday just read what the Prophet talks about godliness to be like God and what about him he said I looked and listened he was looking for something he said I looked and four or five or something like that dictionaries and said cut and find the definition of to be like God what it meant he said that down his brother sewing souls and we got this Dixon or out and said it said to be like God godliness is to be like God well you know he knew that he knew that for he picked up the first Webster but he couldn't find the wordings are you listening he knew virtue meant the natural meaning of the word virtue means to be a virgin the natural meaning of temperance means to not alcoholic didn't use that he said that's not in this case and see to be like God well it just means to be like God but what does that mean what does it mean to be like God well you just act like him no the Antichrist does that you don't act like him devil knows better than that it ain't acting like God it's being God the other we can't be God you making it worse we read in the Bible that sons of gods was God in the Baptist Church and believe that where was you that what was you doing oh he was putting all this out boy hallelujah we was running with who's doing you out and then you just kept running kept doing the prophet called you babies you don't listen he said you've been leaving Baptists alone now you need that quote I don't mean it to be sarcastic I mean it's what he said it he said you better leave him alone he said cuz they know that word see we just couldn't get it together we was the people that had the money in the bank right you remember the story what's the difference in the Pentecost from the other he said one of us got the money in the bank but Cain try to shed got some bad news he don't know worried that how to handle it Pentecostals don't have no money to bite which they've got all the shout and glory hallelujah he said neither one undried let's see we studied a lot of things I can remember right now and then brought it up one day and he said you ever noticed where it says the way go home tonight and just type into your computer and see how many times it speaks of Jesus Christ and being the way the way just the way he said I'm the way the truth and the life just look at how many times it says the way I remember when that man said that I'll never wear Sunday School class but I thought hey I've read a little bit I know he's dry I can find a lot of words are but you see Church that was my background the were when the message came I didn't have to throw down all of these things I just walked right into the message he willing you this and I've told you my whole story and you won't listen because he you won't listen to the rest of what I've said to order to show that out is what I said was right because he I was two years in this message for I received the baptism in the Holy Ghost I've told you that for 44 almost fifty years now I didn't come in this message claiming that I had the Holy Ghost God I believe the Prophet if you do that be careful there's plenty of them on these youtube sometimes it's out there or what they've got all these things there's plenty of them that said I've got the Holy Ghost coat I believe the Prophet and a lot of them ain't here today don't put it on something that Satan can impersonate like the brother said today he and George something I said to him because what we were talking about was a simple little point you said well I haven't felt the presence of the Lord in months I just feel like I'm back slid ain't gonna ask for a raise of hands I'm gonna put mine up both of them because that's pretty well where I stay how about you I ain't asking you to raise your hand I'm just asking to be truthful I stay at that place being brother Gary Atkins used to life and talked a lot about an old brother Gary he said that one thing about it brother Dale we don't fit no one knowing it ones that's true we don't fit in that category or know anyone go in too much anointed I preach Sunday after Sunday and sometimes I go munch without feeling the presence of God praying crying out to him to give me something but he's never failed to give me a message he's never failed to meet me when I ask him he's never failed to heal when I really got serious about that point of thinking he's never failed well which one you draw the high you draw the house the ceiling that Satan can impersonate and we all love the presence of the Lord come on I can talk to you about smelling God's presence I can talk to you about seeing God and I can talk to you about all of them things because it's in my experience but you know what there's none of that that's one time when I see this and this come together this message in the Bible because I didn't throw down the Bible want to come into message that's what a lot of people's doing that's where the trouble and see now they've gone back a lot of going back to the Bible and throwed the message town I didn't have to do that it's been the Lord all the time down through there he's always guided me and he promised me and he's took care of me well which one you draw the high oh the anointing of the feeling of God's presence or him speak to you about his word which one do you want well you can call it and you say all you want to about this award but remember one time you want to talk about the presence of the Lord I can talk to you about it I can talk to you when I chased him through the house with a pistol trying to catch up with him I can talk to you about seeing him in the church not 11 years old I can talk to you about many experiences but see I put none of that that is my experience of the new birth the new birth is the revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you that's what brother Moke told me he said brother Dale I don't know what you're doing I said I don't either for two years I saw God every church we went to I went to the altar had him to cry and praying for me and all but he told me one day he said you you everything they're looking at something it ain't right I'm sorry we bought is it what it don't understand he said well they've one thing for certain the new birth is a birth of the word just go to him as the word and you'll see the birth of the word come forward that was all I needed right there my wife and I both received the baptism the whole goes right there side by side it was the birth of the word because I saw him as he was coming all the way down through my life as he would appear at different places in my life you won't talk a little bit about you don't talk about a promise that he gave of late coming to the Lord and how that I asked him for a sign and I asked him to give him a deer I asked him for said give him something where I can talk to him about I had a dream and I saw the deer with a foot cut off one of them was no cover what you'd call it we were at a certain place there's an old church there and we were back behind it my neighbor even knew about it and we were walking around and I said jury I said that same footprint was in my dream the other night well he never made fun of me he never been that kind of guy he went around her and told from the others he said Sam had a dream of the day of seeing a dear foot and said its back on the back of the church I saw it he didn't have any trouble and you know what was happening at that time I was down in the woods crying my heart out you know saying lord I just ask you for something to speak to wait about you told me he coming I just wanted to know about that time the sweetest perfume ever comes through the woods you've never smelled us and we were a mile at least off of the pavement down in the payment went down to where we're at but I mean off of the main highway mile or two from there and I said now Lord some crazy females down here up in these bushes spraying perfume I'm darkness what I'm saying I get down I said hey don't make me full no more I've got an ultimate deer standing on the ground it's laid down and if while here come a truck pulled up everybody look in the back of that truck and they said come here Sam look my brother know you'd have to know him you take him deer hunting we he's gonna kill 10201 had always done that he just he was that way he was just a hunter great hunter he was in good to hunt with he gets you Darrin Taran see he called him luck job because her neighbor down there coach Terence was with him a first deer he kill and that's when his his jaw was all broke up from that car wreck and he was the ending shot the deer and it knocked him too you know like and be told about old Donal he was good when I walk up I said well where'd you get that Donald he said I didn't get it I said well who got it and here's the back of a truck pulled up with a deer had the deers on the wall at his house right now go look at it he says 'we got it it's on the way home I said son I think it's about to mean you have a little talk because I've asked the Lord for this and I wanted to ask him for something unusual he said dad before we start talking let me tell you he said we got to the woods that morning this morning and he said I was busting to use the bathroom said I violated all hunting rules you know you know what I mean he used the bathroom then climbed up the tree and said I am he said while this deer come out when he turned around over he's left hand he turned around to the left to shoot and in missed him and he said he just stood down looked at me and I put another bullet in and finally shopping there's a big old 10.1 of me you won't talk about the Lord we talk about the Lord I don't know I'm not bragging and I'm just telling you the truth I like to talk about your experiences of what happened in your life is what you've seen I believe it because God is real but after all of that I'd still rather sit down and read his word and just be sitting there reading this word and I just see it all tie together and he's speaking straight to me I'd rather have that than all of the glory could ever be God in all of the world for everything see somebody's going to attain you know why because God said it you believe the Prophet you believe the Bible you believe it alone chain the moment wink of an eye you believe the Scriptures well then it's got to come to Pais why can't we believe we're part of it let's then come on come on musician we get done a little early and I thought it'd be later what we're doing pretty good at least his clocks early thang on these things somebody has got to manifest the Word of God I like that little thing that they've made for me one day and what's in there on the desk where it's talking about the word coming forth and it shows you a pilot of a Bible and it shows that Bible as it comes forth the next stage next stage next day then it finally comes up to a man standing over here because then the word was made flesh and dwelt among us I believe that thank God for a prophet that God could speak his word who to tell us his mysteries you really realize that in that you realize that what God was doing speaking his mystery to a prophet that was his greatest way of doing it because we wouldn't believe if he come himself started talking straight to us he said oh yeah I believe it nothing that don't fit don't play this is serious this we're in the end time we're in the life days when are we gonna start believing we're in the last day and say thank you Lord but we got really lets anybody have a need pray what about it you have a need my god still Leo he's
