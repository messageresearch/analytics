right back in the word I've enjoyed the worship we could turn our Bibles to Genesis chapter 1 I'll read verses 27 28 and then we'll skip to chapter 3 it's been a great privilege to be with you this weekend we appreciate the invitation from brother Samuel your pastor and also it came by way of brother Wade so we appreciate the opportunity to be here on the fellowship weekend it was nice being together yesterday and the fellowship with the other churches and and then also to have the services with the home church today it's been a great blessing we appreciate it very much we pray that God would bless you all tremendously as we brought greetings from our home church there in Hickory you can always work your way up north and come visit us sometime and I know we'd be blessed to see you Genesis chapter the 1 verse 27 says so God created man in his own image and the image of God created he him male and female created he them and God blessed them and God said unto them be fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth and subdue it and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth so this is a commandment given to them male and female even though the female had not yet had expression in her own flesh or the flesh of Adam but yet independently they're outside of him it's still a commandment to them and then I'd like to just read one place genesis 3:15 and this is after the fall and this is god speaking a curse to the serpent he says an output enmity between thee and the woman between thy seed and her seed it shall bruise thy head and thou shalt bruise his heel so he knew there'd be a child even Satan knew there'd be a son come forth that would crush his head so he was always looking for that son to come let's just pray if we could a gracious Heavenly Father thank you for this opportunity we have afternoon being gathered back together Lord it's nice to come quickly back together it doesn't give the world time to intervene and get into our thoughts and separate us from what we spoke on this morning and what we enjoyed together as a family this morning so Lord we pray that you would just ready our minds and our bodies Lord keeping us attentive to receive from you yet again we believe this is your divine purpose for us to come together feast at your table and though I would just be a human man with my own weaknesses and shortcomings Lord I believe that you can take a gift that you've given Lord for your people say can use it today to bless them and strengthen them and benefit them so we pray that you would do so and the name Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen may be seated just keep going right where we were this morning on fulfilling the original looking at God the finishing of God's purpose for the original creation and some of it to see here the outset might be picking back some of the same things we've discussed this morning but brother BAM talked about the three-fold purpose of God that was manifested in Adam and Eve so in Adam and the woman there was his three-fold purpose was hidden in them and it was manifested in them and takes a revelation to see the mystery that was being manifested in them and we're really looking at and emphasizing how the bride is fulfilling the original that she is completing her part in this threefold purpose of God we're taking our inspiration from the statement where Bram said there was Adam and Eve walking in the Garden of Eden every seed bringing forth and so these are the elements Adam and the woman walking together in the garden every seed bringing forth he said it could never do nothing else it never could do nothing else because God said let it be that way it had to be that way says all how I'd like to stop here just a minute to say there is where we are facing yet the completion of that word the completion of what Adam and the woman walking in the garden every seed bringing forth we're facing the completion of that and it has to come to completion because God said let it let their be God said it was to be a certain way and it has to come to completion and so when brother Branham says we're coming to the completion of that word there was something that Adam and Eve did not finish Adam and the woman walking in the garden every seed bringing forth of its kind there was something that was left unfinished and so we're just looking at that word where Bret says we're facing the completion of that word we're just looking at that word to understand what it is that's being fulfilled in this hour what is it that's being finished today what is it that's being completed so we could fully yield ourselves to that purpose and so Adam and the woman in Eden he says walking in the Garden of Eden they were under a command and that command was Genesis 1:28 and it was connected with the law of reproduction which is in Genesis 111 and that's where is that let each seed bring forth of its kind so as God gave in Genesis 111 a commandment for every seed to bring forth of its kind this is similar to the commandment that's given to man and the woman that they would multiply and replenish the earth that they would be fruitful so there to bring forth also of their kind so he says and God blessed them and God said unto them be fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth and subdue it and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth so this puts man and the woman in the image of God over Dominion with the domain and so you could see how that man now is is it's being described it's gonna be reflection of God in heaven what he desired from the very beginning so everything's in perfect harmony and the man and the woman were to be in this beautiful garden this is the unfolding of God's great masterpiece brother Aaron called it his picture unfolding all the time and so Genesis 1:28 that's according to God's law of reproduction in Genesis 111 where you bring forth of each kind that's a species reproduced by a sip the same seed and so as mankind was placed under this commandment and I and not nothing I'm saying today am I saying it because I don't think you know this it might kind of be a cheap trick I'm saying it because I know you know it and when you already know it you get more a man's as a preacher when you preach something everybody already knows you usually get a little bit more amens that's why I don't understand some of these guys I just try to make stuff up my man stay with what brother branham said that way you get more amens and so that's what we're gonna do just stay right in the channel that you guys already know so Genesis 2:18 he says and the Lord God said it is not good that the man should be alone I will make him a help meet for him because mankind in Genesis 1:28 is Commission he's commanded be fruitful multiply and replenish and so God now he said looks at mankind he says it's not good so first time God says something's not good as he created in these days finished it's good it's good it's good it's good very good and he says it's not good why because it wasn't good for man to be alone he says I will make him a help meet for him what because the expression of God was not complete God could see in Adam himself and so he could say well here's Adam and he exists he's existing by himself with the domain in a Dominion but God wasn't satisfied just being God with those worshiping him and a domain in that supernatural realm that spiritual realm he wanted to have a bride of his choosing so his he had evolved to this point where now Adam is a reflection of the highest in heaven this invisible realm there the spiritual realm is supernatural realm now Adam in a physical realm I've heard their expression now just coming down and God says well there I am so he sees an Adam himself he says I don't want him to be alone I'll make a help meet for him and brother branham catches this very principal masterpiece he says when he made this man there was something about him yet that didn't look just right because that he was by himself and that's how God had been by himself so that's why it did look right God wasn't just happy being the highest in heaven with angels worshipping him he wanted to have a bride that could reign with him a bride of his choosing so he wasn't happy to leave Adam at that expression he was the eternal and man now in the image of God also existed on earth by himself so he must have struck a little blow over on his left side and from there he took a piece that struck off of it and made him a helpmate a wife then he wasn't by himself he had somebody with him and that's his great work and that beautiful I'm brother Brown in places this woman that came from men brought forth for man and all the substance the woman had was originally in the man so you see that God is foreshadowing the bride there was nothing she had that came from anything else but Adam himself and so Nana at now Adam and the woman they are a further expression of God Adam was in the image of God now now Adams wife the woman she is an expression of something that was hidden in Adam and now she becomes a further revelation of a mystery that was hidden Adam and it's only Pro trained what is in gone because there's a mystery in the back part of God mind that he's going to achieve through thousands of years and wants to bring into view so the picture of God is becoming more complete this portrait God's family portrait is coming into view and so in Genesis chapter 2 verse 22 and and I didn't go back and read over these scriptures because I feel were just picking right back up from this morning it says in the rib which the Lord God had taken from man made he a woman and brought her unto the man and brother man many references this scripture says he is showing portraying here the bride so according to our prophet Genesis 2:22 is showing and portraying here the bride God foreshadowing this God is showing in the very beginning with this creation not that this was to be his ultimate not that this was to be the end of it all and this was his great perfect picture and Satan came in and ruined the whole program God had planned it all out from the beginning Satan didn't sneak in and Mar this great masterpiece and God go oh no what do i do what should I do let's call it counsel let's figure this out weekend we have a couple options here we can start all over with another earth we could try this we could try that Adams got a lot of other ribs what's what should we do he knew all along what he was going to do nothing caught him by surprise it was it was ordained this way and set forth this way so he was foreshadowing in portraying you when he took this woman from the man and when he said he'd make him a helpmeet that Hebrew word means to one to be at hand always ready to help to comfort in to please he's who make one that was always to be at hand that helped me it's a very unique word it means one before him in opposite so it's like a mirror image one who is a opposite to him corresponds to him the word can actually be called a second self I'll make him a second self I'll make him a help II mean one that's opposite to him so it's a compliment to him just like him but yet okay and exactly like him but opposite so it's a compliment to assist him in aid him in his great purpose so she was a perfect resemblance of the man she was neither inferior north superior came from the side came from the rib they were co-equal and in all things they were equal to himself but opposite wide to suit his purpose to suit his needs and that's when the woman's brought to the man in Genesis 2:23 Adam says this is now bone of my bones flesh of my flesh she shall be called woman because she was taken out of man the woman was made came from the man and as Paul said made for the man so not in wish she made for him but she came from him and then he begins to prophesy the great prophecy of Scripture therefore shall a man leave his father and mother and shall cleave unto his wife and they shall be one flesh and they were both naked the man and his wife and were not ashamed just as God was showing and portraying the bride when he brought out the woman now in the garden God is foreshadowing that eternal Eden of Christ in his bride because here they're together husband and wife with no shame brother Branham says and it is the rising of the Sun he being the groom the bride has to come forward because it's part of him said there's been many many churches churches Brides Brides but there must come one and so he says that it can only be the manifestation of the fulfilling of all the revelations any others have spoke of the bride it can only manifest so it's a fulfilling of all the revelations that have ever been spoken of the bride this one that comes is fulfilling all of it it can only manifest if it does something different from the groom it isn't the bride because she is flesh of his flesh bone of his bone life of his life power of his power she is him she is him with the same ministry to do the same work and so we shouldn't spend our time trying to figure out the difference between Christ and the bride and we shouldn't be afraid that well if we make too much of the bride we take away from Christ no listen the more you speak against the bride the more you're tearing about Christ tearing down Christ I remember a man one time he was he had been married to a woman for maybe 20 years and they got divorced and he was calling me tell me how and was just running down his wife of 20 years and I was just like look the more you run her down the more you run you down she was your wife herb you know for 20 years and so there should be no fear in placing the bride scripturally placing the bride in the message to reckons she is him and we don't we don't tear down the bride at the sake of lifting up Christ it's impossible you got to lift up the Word of God you got to lift up Christ and in doing so you're gonna lift up the Brian any ministry today that's lifting up a man it is not lifting up Christ and any ministries that's not feeding the bride lifting up the bride show it trying to show her in the word who she is that he's not zeroed in on the message of this hour and so this man and this woman this is God's first masterpiece in a perfect Eden but they're under a commission is it I mentioned this morning this is the world that God loved she said it's so pleased him the Garden of Eden in these things it's the enclosure of God's delight the Garden of Eden God's delight of the enclosure of God's delight God's pleasure and so it's a man and woman but not just man and woman they're under a commandment of Genesis 1:28 and that commitment has God blessed them and God said unto them be fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth and subdue it and so this has got a part of God's original purpose part of his original design it was not just a man it was not just and woman but it was a man and a woman under commandment to bring forth seed so as we read in verse 24 Genesis to Adam speaking after this woman comes to him this is that what the inspiration that comes forward therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother now there's no children yet but yet this is what comes forth this is the prophecy that's contained here this is what it is now cemented with this great happening where a man meets this woman for the first time this is what comes out therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother and shall cleave unto his wife and they too shall be one flesh and so this is part of the original word and this word that's being spoken here is signified that there was more to this masterpiece than just the man and a woman there was more than just man and woman the man was to be fathered the woman was to be mother and they were to have a son and he likewise was to be joined to his wife so the very word is signifying there's more to this masterpiece than just a man and a woman but there's also to be seed that comes forth that's very beautiful how the cycle works a man will leave his father and his mother so this would be a child of the man and the woman so he would be in the image of the parents and he says and they and a man going to cleave to his wife he says they shall be one flesh so here the Union starts the cycle over again because the parent when they have a child they are become one flesh again in their child because it's the father and the mother now join together in the child and in it's something my wife often likes to engage in whenever someone has a child she goes oh they look like the dad they look like the mom and who do you think they look like and I always say they look like what a child would look like if those two people had a child that's exactly what it looks like and I've wanted to do a fake quiz some time to show a baby picture show a mom and dad and say who do you see and they all just be random you know that's the real mom not the real dad not the real kid because we'll look for it we'll see something I'll definitely got dad's lips it definitely has mom's ears it's not mom or dad but that's it that's really what the child represents is it represents a union now again of the man and the woman in an undividable flesh you can't take the dad out of that boy you can't take the mom out of that boy it's in there forever permanently so there's a beautiful thing being expressed in Genesis 2:24 a man will leave his father and his mother shall cleave to his wife and they shall be one chapter flesh there to bring forth now brother branham writes in the church age book chapter 5 we're gonna be drawing a lot from the pergamene church age which brother man time in this takes a lot from spoken words the original seed and I was back there in the office seeking the Lord by dream as it were we're trying to maybe there's the playgrounds right there they're not getting much sleep on a Sunday afternoon with the playground right there you think of swing was attached to that room or something but he's just in there doing getting ready for the service and they started playing the tape spoken words in the original scene I was like who chooses these things this is right right where I mentioned they said they've been playing this now for awhile in these services so I believe it's just the Lord bringing that continuity just so you could know it's not for me it's so you would know God's with you God's feeding you looking out after you it's not for the minister any confirmation of vindication to him and should be vindication to you that God's looking out after you and wants to feed you by that voice that's on those tapes that we're listening to those for a purpose we hear that voice it becomes not common to us but it's familiar to us so it can make a difference for us and if somebody comes along and starts to try to tell you things about that voice you can say listen you've come too late because I was just listen to that voice this morning and it said this to me and it struck my soul and it did this for me and it changed my life you've come too late to try to get me suspicious of that voice so brother madam writes and the first son Adam was the spoken seed Word of God he was given a bride to reproduce himself that is why the bride was given to him to reproduce himself to produce another son of God to produce another image of God so that's why out of who's in the image of God was given the help meat is he was given a bride to reproduce himself now this is the purpose to bring forth to produce another son of God that is why a bride was given to him so then you can understand why God would say in Genesis chapter 2 verse 18 it is not good that man should be alone I'll make a help meet for him because now Adam needed a bride in order to be fruitful in order for in order for him to continue his work now if you look at Genesis chapter 2 verse 19 God has just said I need to make someone to help Adam and the very next thing it begins to describe it may seem peculiar its arrangement in scripture but it's here for a purpose and out of the ground the Lord God formed every beast of the field and every fowl of the air so just as God had formed Adam out of the ground the animal likewise the animal life for all these beasts they came from this ground every spoken word seed was already sowed in there and it would come forth forth from him and then it says and brought them unto Adam to see what he would call them now remembered verse 18 he said it's not good for men to me alone I'll make him a helpmate and it help me there's one who's there to aid him and assist him and brother Branham said now he had somebody with him and that's his great work but now when God says I need to make him somebody to help him with his work he begins to describe a work that Adam could do by himself he brought unto them Adam to see what he would call him and whatsoever Adam called every living creature that was the name thereof and Adam gave names to all cattle and to the fowl of the air and every beast of the field here's Adam working this is the work he could do by himself this is something he could do he could have dominion he could do these things he could he can name the cattle he could name the foul there he could name every beast of the field this was the work he could do by himself and so God now is using his son he's working he's laboring he's fulfilling a commission he's doing things that the son is supposed to do but he hasn't he isn't able to finish his work without a wife and that's why I believe this is inserted right here in this and so that you could see that Adam had a job to do but he hadn't finished his job he had to have a helpmeet to finish his job and then even in doing this job there's an image that's being expressed to Adam and there's and if something that keeps coming up before him because the Bible says but for Adam there was not found to help meet for him because every time Adam would name a beast of the field male-female found the air male female all the living creatures male female and so as Adams doing this I've been every every time he named the man he could identify with the man and he could give that that male a part of the species he could give that name and then all when he goes to name the woman I wonder if there wasn't a conversation he was having within himself what am i it's almost like I'm missing something because he saw something expressed an animal life that was inside of him male female male female and there's something maybe communing with he might have had something that felt like in the back part of his mind having fellowship with his laws thinking oh my I just wish there was somebody like me that I could have fellowship with and he long now to have a woman a female part of himself that he can't fellowship with and God saying that's right that's right my son that's exactly how I felt when I was bringing forth angels and I was doing all these great things I was having these fellowships with plots in the back of my mind and now Adams having the same experience God did Who am I is so beautiful but Adam could not finish all the work that he was given unless he had a woman Genesis 1:28 to be fruitful required a wife some brother branham's writes this and it also comes from the spoken words the original sate he says he did not complete all his work speaking of Jesus Christ now he did not complete all his while in his earthly ministry just like Adam he had a ministry but he didn't complete it he was given a woman to complete it so now Christ he works in and through the bride she knows that for it was not yet time for him to do certain things that he must do now but now but he will now fulfill through the bride that work which he left for this specific time just like Adam there was a lot he could do but there was a specific work that worked certain things for a specific time and what was the woman for to Purdue produced the image of God here's Adam in the image of God in order for him to bring forth another image of himself he's gonna it's going to come to this woman because he says he was given a bride to reproduce himself are you with me so far I made the mistake one time of asking is everybody with me nobody said a thing I was like wow this is a sharp group because nobody could answer for everybody so I had to say are you with me well if the individual was they say yes we're right there with you but I don't I don't know who I'm answering for behind me I don't know who I'm answering for in front of me so I say are you awake if I notice people drifting off I might just have you stand up for a little bit god I don't want you to miss this this is this is part of God's program this is what he's ordained to bring us into the unity of the faith I haven't had any fellowship with your pastor before haven't had the privilege of hearing a minister I haven't heard the ministries in this church but in a wonderful someone from the outside somebody just moved from Texas can just show it one day and you can hear the same message preach that you're feeding on that you cherish I didn't submit my notes beforehand and brother Samuel say well this is a good thought just change this here and insert this here and use these quotes there they didn't hand me what to preach there's a confidence in the Holy Ghost confidence and the Holy Ghost to come and speak the things that you have nita so we'll go a little bit further here because now is we can I hope you see that what was being foreshadowed in Adam and the woman brother BAM showing this with Christ and his bride because Christ didn't finish his whole work in the days of his earthly ministry but he will finish it through the bride because that work he is left for this specific time she's got to do certain things so if we look at when the original was marred or how it was changed it identifies it continues identified that word that's been completed today now brother BAM says this in spoken words the original scene I'll just use a number of these statements from there to convey this this thought he says notice what happened to Eve's children the first one that was born now if God said multiplied to his bride to Adams bride and replenish multiply and replenish the earth that was God's commission he says and she would have done it he would mixing themselves together but what happened when Adam got ready to come to her she was already a mother so we know and as we read here you'll see that there was a time that God has a time and there's a timing for something and there were it would have it was an oncoming promise as he describes it and so this was something that had she waited until the time then according to God's words she would have brought forth and she would have done it he said and he makes a very striking statement she would have eventually brought forth Jesus Christ brought forth that child is the phrase that he uses and that's a very staggering statement and now that's had there not been an interruption and and we know that it was God's plan that it be interrupted he knew this he he actually put the woman and this is very difficult to say but brother Evan teaches us he put her on the basis that she would fall that might seem to be unfair but it was all for God to express his attributes it was so that he could have at the end of this cycle a woman having never seen him but absolutely love him and that's what he wanted right woman to love him by faith in my revelation and so he says Adam would have come to her but but but he says when he got ready to come she was already a mother and so he says it this way in the same sermon Adams bride could not wait God had told Adam and Eve multiply and replenish the earth it was an oncoming thing a promise and I think he's making an important distinction here to understand our position today she was not his wife as of yet because he had never lived with her so that's in this consummation of this expression of the marital Union and it had not been completed yet he says she was not his wife as of yet he's using a language for us to understand these things and he says later on he says she got in a hurry what did she do she crossed her seat she mingled it with the Serpent's heed she brought a child of death a child that she perverted every child after that so now they were under commandment and a commission be fruitful multiply and replenish the earth and they were to come together under God's timing under God's Word in God's Way and however he had envisioned him remember uses the phrase mixing themselves mixing themselves together and she would have brought forth an image of God another Adam another expression of God and this is part of God's great family picture I don't and I won't have again I'm not trying to invite myself back or have but I won't have time to get to these things but I thought even the child dedication well it was wonderful this morning because God's great picture his great family portrait was father and mother with children and for this just to continue on and in and I believe that's our table today as token families that were to bring forth sons and daughters of God I'm just bringing forth children we're bringing forth sons and daughters of God and he says it continues this now because this commandment was given to the man and the woman and now the elements that he needs are there the man and his woman the woman there are there and they can take this commandment and go forth with it but he says here let me take these handkerchiefs and he said obviously I didn't see him do it but he said here's the man that was supposed to be right here is the man that's supposed to be what happened Eve hybrid it breed it what did it do then what did it do it turned to death and just keeps dying now and then I believe he's making reference to something he says now here stays the word just the same here's the word lain here just the same now what happened here's the word the word that God spoke to multiply and replenish the earth I think he just heard this right before service says it couldn't find a place to land so when the woman brought forth children even of Adam but that's also the mingling with the serpent that was not in fulfillment of Genesis 1:28 the commandment to be fruitful multiply replace the earth couldn't find a place to land it didn't land in the womb of the woman who but this so this word stays the same it's a prophecy it's still a delayed promise there's a delay it's caring it's waiting it couldn't find a place to land and so here's the man and the woman of Genesis 1:28 with an unfinished work they never finished the work they never did the full thing they never have completed what God had commanded them to do so now we can see what it is that God is wanting us to complete in this hour to replenish the earth that means to be full to be ended to fulfill to accomplish to complete to replenish what was the purpose of the earth to get a bride out of it that's what he made the earth for and were to replenish her to fill up to accomplish the Earth's purpose to fulfill it to bring it to a completion and so just as God created the heavens and the earth and it was without form and void and the Spirit of the Lord began move upon the face of the water and things begin to happen God brings it to a place where the great purpose of God is left pregnant in the earth and he's leaving it to the man and the woman to finish it and I'm gonna let you finish it I want you to take it from here but notice how brother Branham teaches this and this is going back to the way he writes it in the church age book the first son Adam was the spoken seed Word of God we read this a moment ago but we'll read more he was given a bride to reproduce himself that is why the bride was given to him to reproduce himself to reproduce another son of God which would be God expressed be another image of God but she fell she fell by hybridization she caused him to die so this is that this is what happens in the original Genesis 1:28 is never fulfilled because she hybrids she says he says now the second son Jesus also a spoken seed word of God was given a bride like what as was Adam in what would that before to reproduce himself to produce another son of God to produce another image of God that's what she if if that's what Adams wife was for this is what Christ twice was for says but before he could marry her she also had fallen the exact same thing just as the woman had fallen and become Eve now the bride that he's given on the day of Pentecost this great church is coming where it falls and it becomes more brother branham there's the way he describes it there's great commandment to be fruitful multiply and replenish the earth he says what happened he sent Adam and Eve here on earth and said multiply now and replenish the earth this is a peculiar statement their bodies was all laid out here for you to eat and make your body that's the way he had of doing it but sin come along and interrupted his plan so it was all laid out God had it all ordained and all laid out and there was a way that God had his had designed it that it would have come forth and Satan comes along interrupts seemingly interrupts and destroys God's plan but he's playing right into God's hand just like you did with the second animal I'm gonna crucify him what was he doing playing right into God's hands because what you know that saying as soon as this prophecy came forth in genesis 3:15 if you want to turn there we'll read it he says and I'll put enmity between thee and the woman and between thy seed and her seed it shall bruise thy head now this is a curse to the serpent and thou shalt bruise his heel this is prophecy of the restoration of that word genesis 3:15 is the seed of Genesis 1:28 this is the reviving of the original plan and purpose of God there's going to be man and woman and the commanders be fruitful multiply and replenish the earth and so when God says the seed of the woman and there's going to be enmity with the seed of the Serpent and the seed of the woman he's actually prophesied of Christ he's prophesied of that son that would have come he's prophesying a redeemer he's prophesying a restoration of the original because it's brother man says that commandment of Genesis 1:20 could never find a place to land but it finally caught in the womb of a virgin mary' so now when that happens you have the original spoken word of Genesis 1:28 now coming to life and what will it bring forth a son of that commandment it'll be a man of that commandment and what is God going to bring out of that man a bride to fulfill Genesis 1:28 but as soon as that prophecy went forth and thou shalt bruise his heel Satan was looking for a son so is it any wonder that the first son born of Adam and the woman was murdered my hybrid shouldn't be no surprise to you why because the serpent heard it the devil heard it and he knew it's going to be a son that crushes this great plan it's gonna be a son that destroys what I'm trying to do so the first son that's born he's murdered and so he was always looking out after son and finally one came biller Bram said that seed of a woman come into physical apart from the instrumentality of the human male why was Genesis 1:28 and before Adam could come to the woman the woman had been beguiled by the serpent so now what God does in bringing forth the seed of Genesis 1:28 the seed of genesis 3:15 before Joseph could take married to be wife she receives seed from God he's portraying something brand said the word of promise came to the Virgin Mary but that word of promise was he himself to be made manifest God was made manifest he himself acted at that time and fulfilled his own word of promise in the Virgin so then this is what God did he himself did it and that word was he himself and that seed was he himself there was God bringing forth and then it this is what he's portraying in Mary and then Bregman says here's the secret of this is the secret of this the word is in the bride as it wasn't married once he himself in you the word is in the bride so Jesus was the restoration of the original bridegroom the bride is the restoration of the original woman she is that original brought back alright everybody stand up stand up for a moment I think I'm halfway through I'm gonna stand it just kind of stretch a little bit what is it it's just it's just 205 or 305 you're like where they aren't you on the wrong time how everybody everybody feel good you say praise the Lord God's good hey man you may be seated that's the only way I can have to tell people to be seated some of them just had to you may be seated while you're preaching after every but everybody's sit down all the time why don't I have to get you to stand up I hope your hope you have enough to go the rest of the way here if I started just after 2:30 I've only been preaching about 30 minutes or so and I'm halfway done so we're doing pretty good now he says he says this in super sign God the great contractor had all his bodies laid out here on the earth of calcium pot aspart row Liam it's what he said in future home he said there is all laid out what sits in the earth and I think about all the substance wheat comes from the earth only God could look out after all that to bring us to where we are today hi he was going to create it and make it but she bypassed the way of God what did Adam do when he come to his wife when he come to her he found her pregnant of an evil conception had received foul seed that's what hadn't happened with Adam and the woman that came from him now he makes this connection again Jehovah before he couldn't marry his wife did the same thing and Jesus before he could get to his bride she had organized herself and become the Roman Catholic Church these things are there for us to understand what it is we're doing in this last day what makes us different than the first woman what makes us different than the first church because though we're exactly the same there's going to be one great difference listen and this outlet through all other Ages people went to church and fed on the Word of God for their day and the leadership of the Holy Spirit was taking them to a grave and absolutely sealed by the Holy Spirit of God absolutely sons and daughters of God walk into the light of their day but their God ordained supernatural experience led them to a grave but let me tell you there's people in this hour who are not having the same experience your supernatural ordained experience is not leading you to a grave but I'm meeting in the air we're not living for a funeral we're living for a meeting in the air and that's what makes this bride different she's breaking the cycle of revival in death before he can marry his wife before he could get to his bride said she had organized herself he's the same thing but he will have a bride don't you worry that will be bought with his word just exactly what he told Eve to stay with he will have a church amen that will be bought by his word finish what the woman started finish what the church started then it's what God had in his mind and now I want to I want to share this and it's introducing something that's very very large and profound and I just want to make reference to it in brother Branham is using the same type of emphasis in marriage and divorce invisible Union Satan's Eden he says what a woman is entrusted with certain characters that she must not defile him and it's in the sermon that he gives this this detail she says the woman is trusted to them there's not a creature on earth like a woman so there's no female dog there's no female of any kind entrusted with the character that a woman is a woman was not even in the beginning of the creation because God know that she would fall all other females could not commit adultery she's the only one that can commit adultery if she had been made like the original that would have been disk complementary to God's great wisdom and he's obviously sharing quite a bit you have to kind of catch what brother branham's trying to say there the his race couldn't find a very large thought a very profound thought so she was made a byproduct of men and this is where he's pointing out on this balance of this because he in one place and I don't think i'ma get to it tonight he makes the statement and that doesn't mean I'll get to it in the morning don't get nervous everybody's getting nervous now thinking I wish I was on that train he talks about how that this one this woman how that there's he says he's talking to all the filthiness and the perverted woman he said now that's the world the woman he says he says to you sisters now I'll get to your place a little later on because she has her place in the Word of God and it's something similar here he says but now he's just described the woman in this very pro curious way she's interested with characters that she must not defile but he was placed upon the basis that she could commit adultery placed upon the basis that she would fall but yes she has he she's entrusted with certain characters that she must not defile and he says but because she was cast over in that side she has also been given a sacred charge from God for redemption oh can you see what God's raising you up for because the woman was used for the fall God has reserved the woman for redemption Satan used the woman in the fall but God's gonna use the woman in the restoration because Satan used her on that side God's gonna use her in the end for the fullness of redemption that's exactly what he's saying because she was cast over in that side she's also been given a sacred charge a divine responsibility a duty by God for the purpose of glorifying God a sacred charge for redemption the woman has a special place in bringing forth the fullness of redemption listen there's a lot of ways that God could have drawn it up but God knew all along he's like I'm gonna come to the end and I'll let my wife beat him don't let it come to the end I'll let my wife take care of it I'll let it get to them right there and sentence him he came down in my eating and caused the first woman to fall I'm gonna go ahead and let him then go ahead Satan's Eden the perfection of his eating I'm gonna go ahead and raise up a bride and I'll let her take care of the rest put that last double which is death under our feet hey man she's been given a sacred charge for redemption through you will be the completion of what God for shouted in the Garden of Eden he says the spoken words the original seed he says but God came in flesh to give us another birth to bring us back to original sons and daughters of God were you listening to it he was talking about how that new birth brings us back right there before service he says there you are he says the life sperm of Eve never happened it never did why she mingled it kept it away instead of Adam coming to her for a bride when the time appointed would be just like Christ would have come to the group Christ would have come to his church at an appointed time he promised to do it God promised to multiply but they had to wait until God's time and I say it's that time the delay is over the Lord Himself has descended with the shout the mighty angels descended out of heaven with an open book and calls unto his elect come unto me take the book eat it up that you and take in this book can prophesy again being a final voice to the final age being a declaration of Jesus Christ be the name reproduction of God and flesh this is that time the day is over the Old Testament prefigured Christ and all the prophecies and all the figures and sages of the Old Testament they were pre figure of Jesus Christ and then and it finally it culminates in the perfect expression of the bridegroom we read it this morning Brother Bear says she's the New Testament that's all so the New Testament prefigures the Bride of Christ which culminates in the perfect expression of the brine that's what even these church ages have been all about Bram says at harvest time is Noah Moses David reflected the coming of this perfect bridegroom so as Luther Wesley and Pentecost reflected the coming of a perfect bride she and she has a sacred charge for redemption why because bread man says that life sperm of Eve never happened it never did he says before Adam could come to her then he god raises up a church on the day of Pentecost as Christ would have come to his church but before he did before he could Satan was already at work in the midst of him but it didn't stumble garden God knew all along and you think about it just the momentum of this I've been potting this for quite some time the momentum of everything that's been happening since God formed himself in the logos everything building every every turn every second every minute every event every prophecy every miracle every sign every experience at the altar every prayer line every testimony of the the Saints of the days gone by foxes Book of Martyrs my dad would say foxes book of mortars I thought maybe they're all bricklayers but all these things down to the age everything happening everything coming from a time after time it's all been building torn ow you can actually have a people on earth and can look back by way of a prophet giving us this great entrance into the presence of God we can look back and know everything that God has been just the time befallen himself in the world God and she can take her stand on the expression of God and say it's all come down to this it's been building to this moment and this time there's gonna be a bride of his choosing and here she is come it's come to this time where he's come to unite he's joined himself together at this Brydon and brother BAM says in Christ as the mystery God revealed and I just have a few statements left he says the anointed man now the anointed people all my to bring back the anointed bride and the bridegroom anointed by accepting what Eve turned down so it has to be what we looked at has to be there in Genesis 1 Genesis 2 and Adam coming back with the anointed of the word because he said my word of spirit she anointed with the word what Eve turned down he ketched us he comes back and we accept what are we accepting him he said all seven seals are opened if you can receive it we receive it we accept it so how that hybrid condition again just exactly how he done Eve he told him don't you do this don't you do that you can do this and that and Saints you know but she turned around and listen to him but in the last but the even the last days is not going to do it why we're over there and we're just better and we're just good ER and we just try harder and you know it's just we've got mp3s they didn't have him no no he says because she preached she's predestined not to do it why why did the first woman fall well she was ordained doing I mean that's just what happened why won't we fall because we're day not to the even the last days is not going to do it because she's predestined not to do it yes sir God's going to do it he knows he'll have it he said his church would be there without spot or wrinkle she's going to stand there in the splendor of him his word made manifest hallelujah your predestinated motto for all your ups and downs and in and outs and all your weaknesses listen don't focus on that focus on the promise you're ordained not to fall gone to this evil age he says what would God call the people out of this age for the reason is to try her she wants to try his bride and we've been talking about how God what he wants to do in Satan's eNOS it's just all him avenging the engine tables blood his great plan when he cast Satan out of heaven he wanted to deal with that he just just knew just the way to do with it this is dealing with Satan all in new could you all sin old death always says it's a great plan of redemption for God to express himself but now we've come to the end where now this woman has got to be tried by all of it what she's made manifest been tried been proven proved to Satan like it was at the beginning so shall it be at the end there's your statement like it was at the beginning so shall it be at the end as the seed starts in the ground it comes up through carriers the life of it but it ends up in the same seed that it was when it went into the ground and the same way the seat of deceit fell on the ground in Eden is the same way ends up in the last days just as the gospel when it failed to a denomination and I see it it ends up in a super organization just as the seat of the church fell back there with signs and wonders and a live in Christ among it ends up in the last days under the ministry of Malachi 4 and restores back the original faith that was once given we find now this evil age is to prove to Satan she is not like Eve that she is not that type of a woman a man do you believe that we should believe that this age in this evil age is to prove to Satan that she's not like Eve that is she is not that type of a woman and I remember reading this some years back and as I was reading it and pondered it it struck me as I read over it it's at this age is evil to prove to Satan she's not like Eve in other words God wanted it to be the most evil age there ever was so that Satan's with that excuse just like what job they said well I mean look you built the heads around him no wonder he maintains his integrity no wonder he worships you no wonder he blesses you he's up charlie he lives a charmed life and God said you know what take everything away from but his life and he'll keep his integrity and what did job do he proved God right and so it's a similar thing that's happened in this day God says okay I want Satan to build for six thousand years give him as much time as I had to build my eden and let him build his eden and it's there that I'm gonna raise up a bride and just as the woman in a perfect Eden surrounded by no love no death around her at all perfect understanding love of God everything around her everything bringing forth of its kind Satan caused her to fall he now raises up a woman in the midst of great darkness and perverseness and it's the most foul and dark it's ever been and you know why it's evil because of you I mean that's what he's saying that's way he struck me when I read it several years ago this age is as evil as it is to prove the brides not like Eve so it's our fault in a way all right and and listen that means we've got the remedy to it that means we've got power over it because it's as wicked as it is to prove that were not like Eve that even in Satan's Eden we can stand he says she's not like he she's not that type of a woman and she will be tried by his word the brightest Adams bride was tried by the word and Adams bride believed every bit of the word all but confused on one promise that he's the same yesterday today and forever today see but failed on one promise under the temptation of the enemy face-to-face and now the people that's called for his name of course is his bride she is to come in contact again by the same thing not by just denominational truth or something but by every word she it now just as the woman in the beginning had an experience she had the Word of God given to her and she knew this word is she was tried by the word and she came under the temptation of the enemy face-to-face he's saying this bride in the last days has got to come in contact again by the same thing by every word so that what happened literally in Genesis 2 was the woman was brought forth and she had a commandment to be fruitful multiply and replenish the earth and now what she is expressed she's brought face to face with her bridegroom and it's after she's been brought face to face with her bridegroom and has under this commandment has been given the revelation of him and her purpose it's after that she's tried by the enemy and the same thing has happened to us in this hour we have had Malachi 4:5 where the Ministry of Elijah brings us face to face to Jesus Christ now you're Gentiles so the way God reveals himself to you is different than the way he identifies himself with to the Jews everything's physical with the Jews to the Gentiles it's spiritual so he was he was a fleshly bridegroom in the days of his coming to Israel but now it's the revealed word our mate that's what we know our revealed word our made and so now you've been brought face to face with your bridegroom it's our Lord up there there he is standing there and in he's a wigged one the supreme deity it also shows us that it's the lamb now as a lion that's the mane of a lion here he's coming in a different time a different dispensation to avenge his elect and now that you've met him face to face Jesus Christ has made known you through the word and you've been brought into a union with your mate you will now be tried by that word and you face your enemy face to face and you can do it with confidence knowing you can not fail because you've been ordained not to you'll prove that you're not that type of a woman and brother Branham said in the first chapter the church age book has Adam and Eve were in the garden and did not finish out the thousand years now Jesus our last Adam and his Eve true church will fulfill all the plan of God oh you will fulfill he will fulfill you and him together will fulfill all the plan of God not just him it's you that's why when you come to the end of the book it says the spirit and the bride say come now that voice is united together now she's he's speaking through her and invite the musicians to come in Chapter five of the church age but gets spoken words the original seed and I'm not sure just exactly where it is in the tape you're listening to bits where he says pick up the pin and this is how it's expressed here in the church age book and it's a lengthy quote but I believe it just summarizes what I've been expressing to you today and I hope this has been a blessing to you says here's what I'm trying to say to you the law of reproduction is that each species forth after its own kind even according to Genesis 111 and God said let the earth bring forth grass and the herb yielding seed and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind whose seed is in itself upon the earth and it was so whatever life was in the seed came forth into a plane and thence into fruit because that's when you're brought back because the seed fruit is flesh around the seed so you are the fruit flesh around the seed flesh becoming word word becoming flesh he said the very same law applies to the church today whatever seed started the church would come forth and be like the original seed because it is the same seed in these last days the true bread church Christ see sow the seed is not not so much what the first church was but what the bridegroom was we'll come to the headstone she will be the super church a super race as she nears him then the bride will be so much like him that they will be in his very image this is in order to be united with him they will be one listen to this they will be the very manifestation of the word of the Living God denominations cannot produce this wrong seed they will produce their Creed's and their dogmas mixed with the word this mongrel izing brings forth the hybrid product first son Adam was the spoken seed Word of God he was given a bride to reproduce himself that is why the bride was given to him to reproduce himself to produce another son of God but she fell she filled my hybridisation she caused him to die the second son Jesus also a spoken seed Word of God was given a bride like was Adam but before he can marry her she also had fallen she liked Adams wife was put to the test whether she would believe the Word of God and live or doubt the word and die she doubted she left the word she died but we're living in a time there'll be a people not taste death here right form a little group of the true seed of the word God will present Christ with the beloved bride she is a virgin of his word she is a virgin because she knows no man-made Creed's or dogmas this is the phrase that just sums it all up and you'll say brother Aaron you could have read that this morning we could eat chicken all day but he says it all right here by and through the members of the bride we'll be fulfilled all that was promised of God to be made manifest in the Virgin Panama I love that I'm gonna read it I'll keep maybe reading and maybe a few more times because I really want you to catch the distinction he makes here it just doesn't say through the bride because a lot of us think it's just going to happen by proxy will brother Samuel you're doing it for us brother Wade you're doing it for us oh yeah we're just thinking all they're all they're doing it for us and all men this great move of God over in that church and a great thing happening over there overseas and these signs and wonders happening everywhere else listen we all have our part to play brother man talks about you may not lay your hands upon a body and watch it be quickened to life you may not be the one that sees miracles happen you may not be present when the Spirit of God moves in a service and people shouting and passing out because the God moves in different ways he gives us gifts everly in different dispensations and things but there's one thing you can say for sure that you as a member of this bride you have a purpose you have a job to do and thus said the Lord is God doing his work through you just as he promised to do him bringing his word to pass however he thought of it in the beginning and so what he expressed is here I was waiting for the whistle to come I knew it was coming he says by and through the members of the bride not just the bride collectively but through you as an individual I want you to take this to heart brother Brown as I read this motion I must serve his purpose by and through me will be fulfilled all that was promised of God to be made manifest in the Virgin what was promised to God to be made manifest in the woman in the garden what was promised to be made manifest and the woman of the first church is now going to be fulfilled by and through the members of the bride God is completing the original God is finishing the purpose of the earth and he's going to do it for you I said god I want to serve your purpose by and through the members of this church spoken word Church God will by and through you fulfill all those to be made manifest in the Virgin god bless you let's stand to our feet why don't you just give them thanks maybe we could say of course if I love him I love him I sing it in the key of C if that works for you all it'd be good for me let's think about what he's done for you think of this as we sing this great course to him oh I love him hasn't he done such wonderful things for you love him [Music] [Applause] [Music] because people love me [Music] is my salary [Applause] long time every street just lift your hands and praise them now [Music] [Music] because he loved me chest sound a Danka I hope you can just see this beautiful theme in the word how we're fulfilling the original ha there's so much there in this seed chapter of the Bible God is quickly laying all these things down because you know it's just how quickly he gets through creation the fall of man and he's quickly getting to Abraham why because now it begins to foreshadow in Abraham what he's going to do through Christ in you because the seed promised Abraham was the seed of genesis 3:15 which is the promise of Genesis 1:28 it wasn't Isaac but it was actually Christ and Paul picks this up and you're tracing it all the way back to Jennifer and what you find genesis is foreshadowing you go all the way back now thousands and thousands of years later here you are over 6,000 years later and here we are and that's what was foreshadowed then it's amazing to think of it that way but that's exactly what it is really this this this gathering right here and this almost 50 year old building whatever it is you're the culmination of Genesis 1 you're the culmination of Genesis 2 you're the bride of genesis 3:15 really well just go back to the days of Christ 120 gathering up a room and that was the culmination of Jesus ministry it's always been that way accept it you are fulfilling the original purpose and plan of God let's serve his purpose our gracious Heavenly Father as we stand here this afternoon just feeling a greater love in your word now Lord just feeling as if we've communed with you and you've spoken to our heart and lord we believe that you've taken the things that we've heard before and we believe and you've just rehearsed them in our ears to enthuse this once again of these great principles and truth and father I pray today that you bless these people it's wonderful to see this family of God come together and I know there's a genuine fellowship amongst them and Lord we know every church's it's not without difficulty that there's challenges they face Lord of personalities and offenses now Lord there's even with different ways of doing things and it's just this sticky human nature that we have but we believe if we can let this word have preeminence it'll blend us together and harmonize our voices harmonize our differences and what allow us to come into this vocal union where this church here regardless of our different backgrounds or different ethnicities and our difference find the different financial conditions different ways of doing things in different ministries if we could submit under the headship of the word and let you have the preeminence then we can harmonize together and be a great voice living out against the enemy in this hour i'ma pray that you help us Lord to serve our purpose further and further unfold yourself through us Lord let us become the very image of God by your word we commit the people to your design that you just have your way Lord bless them I pray may it may there be if something special poured out upon them Lord so I just seal these things from my heart delivering my burden Lord may you bless them abundantly with the great revelation Lord in them the move of the Spirit and your preeminence amongst them and that name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen amen can we just sing that song I bless your name some midnight if you should find [Laughter] you're in a pretty is in your mind reach out and pray [Music] the Bible's change and they will fall jumps up because they're broken you've been set free I bless your name my lord [Music] I give you order give you praise you the way I bless
