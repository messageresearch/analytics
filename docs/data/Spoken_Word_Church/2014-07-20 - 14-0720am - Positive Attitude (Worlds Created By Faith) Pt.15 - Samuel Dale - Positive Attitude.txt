see everybody in the house of the Lord if you like turning your scriptures we'll turn to Hebrews 11 and then we'll go go to Genesis 1 Hebrews 11 Genesis 1 now we know that there's many sick among us and things we pray the Lord would bless and is brother Boyd doing okay still having problems he's got pneumonia and he's having problems so just remember to pray for that the Lord would would touch him and now the Lord willing we're going to have a baptismal service this afternoon after the evening service uh sister Rebecca wants to be baptized and we'll be glad to take care of that and anybody else that desires to we always have plenty of water and plenty of time for baptismal Services amen remember that uh Wade will be preaching the Lord within Wednesday and just pray that the Lord would bless him and take care of it and any other announcements I only miss one somewhere but all right Hebrews 11 and then Genesis 1 Lord Jesus we thank you thank you for everything father that you've given unto us and you said you give it to us freely so we didn't have to do anything to get it we just sit back and relax and thank you for everything we ask you that you would just guide each and every one of us in understanding of you Lord that you'd open our eyes to Thy Word word and that Lord we may be able to see you we pray that you'd touch the sick among us because you promised it you said you sent your word and healed us we touch brother Boyd there Lord deliver him Brother Gary Lord the different ones that are sick among us God we know there's a lot of sicknesses here we pray that the Lord would that you Lord would have the preeminence in taking away all the things because we know Satan can't do it but we know you have already done it all we got to do is believe you as we read your word you come and speak to us Lord guide us now and forgive our sins lead us in thine understanding bless each one Lord in Jesus name amen Hebrews 11 now Faith is the substance of things hope for the evidence of Things Not Seen for by it the elders obtained a good report through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God so that things which were which are seen were not thing made of things which appear all right do appear all right now let's notice now it says we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God all right now let's go to Genesis 1 and and it says in the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth and the Earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep and the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters you may be seated the Lord at his Blessing to the reading of the word now I skipped over the uh second verse of Hebrews deliberately because uh you know it says there that uh that we understand the elders to obtain a good report so we will go to that you know when we start getting into each one of the of the uh ones it says by faith Abel by faith Enoch by faith all right we will try to get back onto that part but I want you to think about today the thing I want you to think about is what we've been studying that faith is the substance of what things consist of all right so then God it says created the Heaven and the Earth you'll notice in that form it's in a singular heaven and a singular Earth all right and then we get over into Hebrews 11 and it says the worlds were fined one of them dealing with a singular the other one seemingly dealing with more than one all right I won't try to cover too much on it but a little bit to where that we can make sure that we understand because I asked a question there Wednesday night about Genesis uh you know in the account and things that to make it to where we can stay with the word of God that it says in the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth all right and then there's just a big old period there mean stop you know think about these things consider it all right then science comes along and they say well the world is billions of years old well we agree with it we have no argument about the uh doings and the things because that's what it says and it says and the world was without form and void and the spirit of God moved upon the the earth and the waters and the different things you know and uh see then that wouldn't matter because that would make it to where science could come up and with their carbon contents they call it um try to prove a lot of things they just go too far with their proving because like I said they take a bone that Wednesday that uh is laying on the ground and they take the bone the carbon content of the world is billions of years old no problem because it said God created heaven heaven and the Earth so there's no problem with the carbon content of the world being billions of years old see because you know God just created it went through they know that there was forms called ice ages uh there was all kind of things that they can prove scientifically that did take place and and we believe that all right but then I asked the question upon what day was the world the Heaven and the earth created and and we spoke just a second on that and and I'm not going to spend a lot on it but just say it this way that see the world and things was not created on the the first day it just simply says the Heaven and the Heaven and the Earth was created then day one starts with verse three when you start talking about light l i GT all right in that then you're you're breaking it down then to to the creation and the six days of the creation you know and each item or what whatever coming on the the times and it brings there that it says light all right then you get about to the fourth day or somewhere third or fourth day and and you start talking about the Sun and the Moon all right see then it's not speaking of maybe that in the part or in the first day it's dividing the day I mean dividing the darkness and it's it's not that there wasn't any light you know but we'll say in this dimensional or situation existence uh light was not in this part all right then you know God moved it into a situation or turned on the light really scopio gives you a definition of it that that in Genesis 13 that is really not a creative act it is a uh more or less a revealing you know a coming into being or letting it be known because it stipulates see that that that Darkness was upon the face well now dark God didn't create Darkness right you say well God create no no God didn't create Darkness Darkness is an absence of light that's why you can be so dark in this room but yet the darkness of this room you could take the darkness of the world and put it in this room but strike one match see the light shines because darkness is not a creative act Darkness was an absence of light so then uh my way of seeing it is this way that God was going to use you know and do and creative and as he did then in that Dimension our our uh remember we brought it out brought around and said this seed was laying there upon the Earth from some other civilization well a lot of people thinks then there was other civilizations created you know or something I I don't agree with that but I do believe that there were as we'll get to it in a minute there were many worlds created all right it's all going to come from one thing it's all going to come from one point that we do believe basically in not all they teach but we do believe in The Big Bang Theory that all at once you started this great something happened Bloom and then out goes the the uh Sparks from the Sun and the things you know that created all of the planets stars and you know and and stuff like that and and it took me you know 20 years to learn there was a difference a planet and the star and all like that you know because it's just how dumb we are but the point of what I want to get at is just simply this and then maybe we'll get back to this uh eventually but the Bible is right when it says in the beginning God created the Heaven Heaven and the Earth and then it stopped right there all right so he created everything all right and then later on he begins to after Millions trillions or whatever years and I saying about the the carbon content of the bone it's impossible to brush off or they wouldn't try to brush off the Earth from the bone so naturally when they analyze the bone if they cut inside of it it would be so many thousand years old but by taking the carbon content of the outside of it it would be the same age as the Earth it was laying in that's no problem with me I've always tried to be sensible because I think that's the point to be that we don't deny science we don't deny those things but then when science says you know this is wrong or that is wrong we we go back to the Bible and see it could was without forming void for billions of years all right then God started using it and the first part was light came into being to take away the darkness then it's recorded that that is the first day so then the Earth was not created on the first day the heavens were not created on the first day and it says singular Heaven and Earth all right because that then would fall back to the point that uh it was possible that everything was in one shape one form then the atomic uh nuclear or whatever went off and and blow into what is called a Big Bang Theory and then you started moving out and doing this and doing that and then as a prophet describes it which is very simple then to me he just simply saw the Earth where we're at now he saw all these planets and everything and he put them in place to to be where that they would be uh moons with control Sun would do this but remember we we're not the only one in the solar system that has a sun we're not the only one in the solar system that has moons right see there is solar systems of solar systems you know out there there's other situations that would exist just like we exist all right in the point that it would have the moon the Suns and the things that would be into that all right we'll get back to that in a second but I'm not trying to be a scientific person I'm trying to make a point because the point is faith is the substance of things hope far the evidence of Things Not Seen so whatever it took to bring into being the Heaven and the Earth it would come from the word of God is that sensible it would be the word of God because he said let there be all right see then that would be the creative act of God speaking his word or it would be the spoken word would be the the the Creator all right now are you following the point see then that would put it all into one situation that God could just speak into being whatever would be so when he said let there be a heaven let there be an earth then it would be uh correct because he would be bringing it from a substance of Supernatural or the creative act of his own word as we'll read in a little bit when brother BR said God believed his own word I like that he he believed his own word you know all right I I think he still today believes his word all right and see then it would be a creative act but it would be done in such a way until scientific man could use his uh theories and ideas and come forth with uh sometimes a sensible answer but irregardless less of what evolution could come up with or anything could come up with to the poliwags to the frogs or what uh somewhere the polywog got started so that ends that problem you know whatever you want to say it was to start with if you want to call it energy because that's one of the main things they deal with that that energy and energy cannot be created and or destroyed it's only being controlled to a degree all right so you can call it energy but but still where did the energy come you know whatever it is it would have to go back to almighty God being the Creator why would be the problem you know that's why I say that there's no such things as atheists there's idiots but not atheists because see if you believe that there is no God yeah see this is I know I I get rough and tough but this is the way I talk then I don't have to back down if you think there is no God or never was a God or whatever then you got to believe yourself to be superior you think your concept or your thought is the superiority so you're making yourself a God why don't you solve it that way and say as far as I'm concerned and then you can say I'm God no brother Dale I wouldn't do nothing like that that's what you're doing you're just dumb enough that you can't see it see then it brings it all back to God being the Creator we bring it back to him speaking the word and whatever would be needed could be brought into being right see it doesn't go over to day three day four day five or something and speak of a thing like we look at it it goes over into there like he created trees he created this he created that he created animals you know what we are dirt all right so we was in the original all the trees was in the original come on do we believe it every Apple it ever be on the trees and the seed when it goes in the ground so every tree in the garden a creative act brought a tree from an existence of what we as human beings cannot comprehend so why not just call it faith I mean to me that's what Paul was doing he didn't just start out talking with people about faith a't it odd I sitting there yesterday considering and I thought Lord now come on this thing is great and I was thinking why didn't they say by faith able say that first no cuz Abel's well over in the story you got to get the world here you got to get everything here and then you got to bring Abel out of the world and let him come into being then you talk about Abel by faith you know that Abel's Revelation provided a lamb all right there's a lot of things in the Bible that you're going to have to go from natural to a Supernatural part and that's why I gave the definition as I believe it to be that faith is the substance of things hope for all right we know that's in the Bible but whether it be natural or whether it be spiritual now when you get over into the creation and the dividing then remember the heaven was created no brother Dale how would you create heaven we see we're defining that as what we think we're not defining that as God the great Supernatural Above All The Heavens because heaven just refers to the atmospheric condition around you right am I right go home read it Webster tell you the Bible says you divide the waters that was above and the waters below and you know that could shoot all the way to the moon and couldn't find no water and argued with Noah about the water but the Bible had already said the water was there but it was there in an existence that would not be recorded by mankind I'm not a scientist I'm just trying to express something to you that faith is the substance of whatever you desire if you desire your healing then the word of God has to have that healing within it right so what we need is a revelation not of what day this is and what day that is and who done this what what day this come into being that's where you can spend all your life and become an educated idiot right instead of just simply sitting down and saying well the Lord took care of this it come into being now let me see what about me but are you following me so whatever comes into being whether it be the heaven or whether it be Earth remember it comes into being by a creative act because it says that in Genesis now Paul Paul is just a tiny bit distinct little bit difference but I'll be glad to give you the definition of the word but Paul is really more into to FR Paul uses framed whereas Genesis uses created there's a tiny bit of difference in the definition but not enough to be able to deal with but we'll get to that point that you it will open up to our understanding to where that we can see it all right so now watch my point whatever comes into being are you with me no matter what it is if it's anything we have any comprehension of understanding of or looking at will it be Heaven what do you mean Heaven would was created it was just there well that ain't what the Bible say so you can be an idiot idiot if you want to that's just part of that tree right in the garden cuz remember the Bible will Define heaven as being a firmament that's above all right but Remember by the New Birth the Bible says we are resurrected sitting in what Heavenly places in Christ Jesus well I I kind of think we're sitting here today don't you I don't think we're floating in space you know and I never did believe the people on the other side was hanging upside down and and that's why they had the slanted eyes I never did believe that one but think about it the worlds were created by the word of God when God said let thy be the from his Supernatural uh existence or whatever want to call it you see I I believe now I'm just honest so I'll tell you this we talk about where did God come from well the Bible said he come from teeman but you have to fuss about that all right but you say well well you know I believe that coming this away it come more real no no no that's that to me is a very um odd statement to be able to make for it coming this way made it something I believe that before anything ever existed that God existed alone all right but did he exist alone as a floating flob because remember they wouldn't know haveen as we know of remember there was no Earth as we know of and remember if things came from a former civilization he didn't I don't run that into it was other worlds created we got no problem because the Bible says they was we'll get to that but you want to try to make it some other civilization of people or something no but there was another civilization before this civilization and God existed alone he was that Civilization then he created angels and they were in that Civilization with him is that true and they worshiped him and made him God come on is that true then there must have been a greater World there than this world is I've tried 40 years to get that point across and it just don't seem to deep down into people's minds cuz we want to think this is the real thing this can be blown to smithin and taken totally out of existence and turn back to the original gases that it come from so evidently there must have been gases back there somewhere for it to come from you understand what I'm getting at I believe God is real he's just not an imaginary thought or a myth he created all things and he created it by his word you remember Wednesday night we got into it we'll drop back down to that a little bit later on God's not through yet he's still creating remember he's creating his bride remember she's a new creation not the old one made over but a new one all right so what do you think about it so then the worlds were framed by faith Faith being the substance of things H for the world could come from that situation that God existed alone but yet he could have thoughts and he could create all right and then he he would create see he could say Let There Be and it would just come into being what would come into being what was in his mind what was in his very being what was a part of him that remember to him it was already there to us we talk about a beginning right but remember his thoughts never had a beginning that's Eternal God I don't believe there people but but brother Dale God is a spirit amen you're right you're right you got a scripture but what are you going to do about the rest of it where it speaks of the heart the hands the mind the things of God there the Bible speak of it see then why don't we settle down to what the Bible says instead of our own Theology and where our theology crosses the word of God we get rid of theology we need neology right we need a little praying about things that's what makes me so you know when I heard that Prophet that first time when he said he said my daughter said that they're telling them in school that the world is billions of years old but said Daddy I thought you know paraphrasing it I thought it maybe it was only 6,000 years he said but honey science is right said because the B says in the beginning God created heaven and earth perod said it might have been billions of years before it was ever used you know what it makes sense you know how I am the Bible is the only thing that's sensible right it is the only thing that's sensible your ideas and my ideas are not sensible their concepts are thoughts of imagination and most of them are motivated by Satan are you thinking then when he says in the beginning God created heaven and the Earth he made that a singular form I believe because that would be what it would be that that would be before the Big Bang Theory and you could put everything into one point and then you could have the Big Bang Theory and then Here Comes worlds right now we're still in the Bible because we read in Hebrews that it said the worlds were framed plural worlds were framed how though by the word of God so then in his creative act he showed what he was going to do now I do not believe that when this thing winds up that you're going to have to destroy all of these universes and all of these things now maybe you do but I don't but I do believe whether your s speaks it or whatever it is I believe that this Earth where we're living today is the center of the universe now it doesn't mean that like you're thinking the center of the universe means everything is evolving around it that's not what I'm talking about because there are at they are places Beyond this like I said to start with that they have their own moons they have their own Stars they have their own things gathered into their own solar system and we're just one little minut spot but you see I'll get to that in the minute God chose this right here you know why I believe that because he came down here he didn't go to Mars Jupiter well he might have created other people and put put them on them other stars and all them planets out there and they'd be just like us but where's your Bible I've got the scriptures where's your Bible it says in Genesis Eve is the mother of all living so whatever is out there would have to come from her and why move it out there when not think about this is where Heaven and Earth is going to connect you don't have to destroy everything else wouldn't it be wonderful one of these days that you and I could just say well let's just take a stroll and where you going said well I heard it's about 10 million miles to some Planet let's just walk over there ain't going be in no hurry because everything will be Eternal and I thought we believed that heaven was going to come down to earth and what we talk about is a future home well is that too far out of line when that heaven God himself came to this earth who live in these bodies in the New Birth is that hard to comprehend well then you can see that we're going to be the this to me is where God chose it to me that's the reason it says the way that it does then it says in the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth right if the Big Bang Theory is correct of what they saying then every planet come off of the sun somewhere as we talk about it a big ball of light gases and the things exploded and out went things you've heard the prophet talk about it he said he let the Earth just move out there he said he took it so far away he said he let it go through a nice age and he let it just cut all of these places and do all these things he said then he just brought it right back in just a little piece and you know what it started forming into trees and grass and things that he created what about a seventh grade education man being able to talk to scientists about the world if they would have just listened to him but they wouldn't do it they have their own theories all right but just remember if there's anything that is ever created it is a creative act of almighty God because Satan can't create he perverts he can't create all right so anything that's a creation has to come from a creator and that ought to show God as being real even to an atheist but are you listening well I thought this wasn't going to take but a minute but in Genesis 1 one it says Heaven singular Earth singular we're created which means they were brought into being you know from something that was nothing into being as to we call it something you know tangible materials and as it did God had a reason for it okay we went through the big bang no problem Heaven and Earth you know is one one and then have a Big Bang Theory and let it slatter all the planets and Scatter everything and it just comes out as I was just covering about the Earth and how he'd move it out all right and how he would do that and we read there in Genesis I mean excuse me in Hebrews 11 three through faith we right is that the Bible through faith we understand right the world were framed by the word of God we understand so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear so over in that other civilization you want to call it Heaven you want to call it the place of God whatever you want to call it you don't have to have dirt and trees and things as we look at it I'd say it be 10 times thousands times more beautiful and you wouldn't have to have big old skyscraper uh buildings and airplanes to fly and and the things and see the movie industry takes these things and they make movies but sometimes you don't they hit pretty good I mean there was a guy named Superman right and Superman come from Krypton right and Krypton was a super race above all of this but remember s uh Superman didn't create the Earth he came to Earth but it does show that in the human mind we think about the things that can be done but you know what they're doing today they're almost bringing the human back to a supernatural Superman existence I remember reading about an old Indian way back a long time ago run 15 mil a day getting away from the troops they couldn't capture him he run 15 m a day and he'd eat up with arthritis I guess he stopped along the way and smoked a lot of weed I don't know ain't none of my business it's just true but nothing today for these soldiers to run 15 miles and do almost Supernatural things for the human bodies little brother sitting back there he got his head busted trying it but he can run up that wall over there I'm not going to ask him to do it but some of these days I'd like to watch him because he's trained a human body right karate has trained people until it's almost a supernatural thing with the human bodies that they can do because we're getting back closer to that original civilization right there was Giants in the land it talks about in the beginning and I'm not just talking about black white yellow green or brown I'm talking about now today what do you got you got the the tallest the shortest man on the basketball team now 7 foot I mean unless he's exceptionally exceptionally good he's going to be 7 foot tall we used to jump up to get the ball in they just laying it down it's getting back to the original where it says there were giants in the land all right but listen church now the point I want to get them know I'm just going to get this part prob have to back up so it says in the beginning that God created heaven and the Earth period right but then Paul says that by Faith by a Revelation right we understand that the world's plural were framed by the word of God now you're coming from The Big Bang Theory as one and heaven and all and just go and start planets and Moons and stars and Suns and all kind of things and science has always said this which I understood it from from school listening to them and you know CU I love to listen you learn a lot if you listen you go to school kids if you'll sit down there and listen you do better than you do trying to go home do your homework I'm not suggesting doing it away with the homework I'm suggesting you listen because it can be done all right but we find that through listening that a lot of things are correct you know and that there are many worlds so Paul when he was writing must have been correct when he said the worlds but he used the word framed instead of choosing to use the word create very little difference but you can look up the definition but he say it was framed by the word of God all right they asked brother randam a question go ahead and pull up number one brother or excuse me number two well let's read number one Hebrews 11 God who at Sun Times and in diver manner spake in times past unto the prophets or to the fathers by the prophets as in these last days spoken unto us by his son whom he has the pointed there of all things for whom also he he made the worlds worlds plural all right we'll read in a minute where there's not anything created that he didn't create he's specifically says worlds they asked brother Brown the question on questions and answers 1959 paragraph 161 is there more than one world yes there's worlds of Worlds Hebrews the first chapter in the second verse Hebrews the 11th chapter and the third verse there's worlds of Worlds God created the worlds w o r l DS worlds so there worlds so God is writing in Genesis of one Paul is bringing it down to see that it come from that one and went out and made worlds brother R speaks on bma's vision of this way he is the one who conquered Both Worlds of the seen and unseen right so there ain't no Superman up there that's stronger than he is you don't have to worry about nobody coming from Krypton to try to take over but it does say the world of seen he said and the Unseen which mean there nothing can come from anywhere to conquer this God because he's a creator of the seen and the Unseen what we see he created what we can't see is the supernatural worlds fourth Dimensions Etc set a TV up here and you see the pictures he's a master of all don't worry about it both worlds are seen and unseen he created worlds brother R said Hebrews 11 says that so then when the Big Bang Theory went off then you see it it scattered all of these planets it scattered all these things and as it did it made all of this atmosphere Heavens it's whatever we don't want to call them you know like brother Brandon was talking about standing looking at them two stars you know remember when he told a man he said according to science they're further apart than we are from here to there as I started to tell you they say that the the world is that it's just moving I believe that this whole universe and everything is still moving I believe that you know why because God's not through creating well he created a physical right he created a physical creation and we came out of that original Earth that original place that was all together as one and he moved the Earth out to its place now that's why I believe Paul is stipulating framed framed more than he's stipulating creative act he's making us framed another words out of all of the whole things that he created he chose this Earth to frame it he chose this Earth to make it inhabitable oh up in the space they got these things look like monkeys no no no there's too many monkeys here to worry about what's out there you right always talking about things you don't believe in extraterrestrial be no I don't I believe in inter terrestrial I believe in idiots that are trying to make you think that there are those things and I've like I've always said to you that they say well so and so's been picked up so and so's happened this has happened you don't believe those things I believe they've happened I believe that there are actually uh spaceships flying around us but I believe they're our own because if you you'll go back to about 1955 somewhere in there I'll be glad to find it for you brother Brown says Russia had Jed our planes well we know that because Hitler had jet our planes at the end of World War I they just couldn't know how to control them it was just too F he couldn't do anything with them but he already had Jed a planes right and Russia brother R said had Jedi planes and flying saucers this into your computer flying saucers and lock it princesses and then put Russia in you'll find it they say they got one out there you know that every president gets the opportunity to go see these aliens that are in this spaceship you know which like I've always said ain't it kind of funny that everybody that is picked up by these aliens that these aliens can can speak whatever language they are and all of them haven't been English some of them have been Russians and chineses and you know whatever ain't it odd they can speak that language yeah he learned it at Yale but brother Dale what have you run into one of them guys I'll say Hey Joe how you doing you say you wouldn't be afraid why be afraid of anything like that that's not something I'm trying to get it out of the kids' mind see what science says brother Bram says they're flying saucers do you want to quote he said one day they'll pick you up now is it going to be a flying saucer that picks us up is he got a bunch of them parked out there in outer space waiting and he's going to scoop down to earth no terminologies wording to try to help the human mind understand where you and I are at but remember one thing everything is created that exist it was created by the word of God now why would it be any problem then to thinking about why would it be any problem to think that God chose this Earth that you and I I live on he took it out as the prophet said and let it go through a nice age and let it do the things and then he brings it back into existence things and then that is day one day two day three of what we call the creative acts of God that these things start coming into being you know the light then this then the trees and the grass and then the animals and then the you know the dividing of De this St three and what it four and five or four five and six it defines there the animals start to be created on one day and the rest of them created on another day you know all and uh why not think about it as being the great Eternal god with his plan and purpose to use this Earth that you and I live on to make this his is permanent Dwelling Place in this existence I like the wording that he used one day he said the reason there's 30 minutes with silence in heaven he said they just ain't nothing up there I got a tickle when I heard that I thought you know that's right if he comes down here he's not up there right angels and everything come here they're not up there but you see I what I believe is that Supernatural world is coming to this world the Eternal God came to this earth I ain't worried about going to the moon stars I wouldn't mind taking a ride up there i' always like to do something like that I wouldn't mind going to the Moon with them right up and and back I just don't have the billions of dollars to be able afford it but uh you ever want to get rid of me just buy me a ticket and I I'll go up there cuz I'm not afraid of those things I I really enjoy it and I've always told you that it wouldn't have bothered me when they first went to the moon to have found spaceships sitting on the moon to have found module never what's that word for cities what bother me today he said why because they come from here if they could tell Noah that it wasn't going to rain you know they could have been flying around up in space a long time ago but remember it would be coming from here it would be marked on the outside of the thing us steel right my point it' be coming from here that wouldn't have bothered me it would have oh the Christian world's all wrong with it no would have bothered me and said they come from here and I'd have been tickled to death because that have been a better way of telling knowing that it wouldn't going to rain but see God had water reserved in an atmosphere that their scientific instruments would not read about there were more scientific there than we are in today even before I heard of brother brandom I read it about in the 6 60s that they found those uh uh pyramids down in Mexico and that they had found batteries in those pyramids that were actually capable of like our batteries maybe not looking like them but made to be able to do what our batteries do you see we we want to make all that thing as being not true I want to take it and incorporate it into my understanding as to where that the great Superior Eternal God came from an existence that we know nothing of in the human part that he was a man not a floating Spirit not just a glob floating around remember he created man in his own image so whatever image the man is that was the image God was in before he created to man or am I am I right are you following me so remember in Genesis it speaks of Heaven and Earth but Paul speaks of Worlds and we'll get into it this evening where that all things were created by Him and without him there was not anything made that was made who Jesus Christ not the flesh man the Eternal God we existed before anything and you say he existed alone not because it's just one but then he begin to create and he created angels they worshiped him he becomed in our word God and that's why you go over to Genesis right come on the Bible is exactly right what does it say in Genesis 1:1 God created the heavens and the Earth what God that had already been worshiped by the Angels so the world didn't come first the Angels come before the world and he was already with the word god Elohim see then he could be that one true and living God that we talk about you see what we've been doing is contacting that other world to the Revelation remember may I quote the prophet that heaven consists of what thank you Heaven consists of the word to whatever it comes from whatever we think about come from the word the spoken word and a better way of saying it Heaven consist of faith then we're going to get down into some little things with the scriptures and this is a background to try to get this in your mind that God is not through creating now he created a physical world all right he's not having to create more worlds we're not into that but one day he took what came out of this Earth in the form of a fish and he multiplied it right that fish come out of this Earth but yet he multiplied that showing he was the great God the Creator right nothing since then now watch this point nothing since then has been created out of Earth unless God used it or done it he said when you say it like that because here comes a prophet that God challenged him about Mark 11 and says you need squirrels he didn't take a squirrel off a tree and multiply it into another squirrel cuz you're going more back to the original he spoke not take a fish and multiply it he spoke get back to this this evening I thought we believed this message you know what brother Ramon one day he said I prayed for a man's nose and it said he'd come back on his face ate off of cancer he said it took a while he say it's worthy he said or Roberts prayed I believe it was him or would FF BOS which BOS said he prayed and it came back instantly now if that wasn't a creative act I want you to explain something to me but see you think see your mind's hung on what you think a quote is that he finished physical creation that's right the squirrels that brother Brown spoke into existence come out of whatever brought this world is where they came from he never picked up dirt and said because you got it in the book of mcab you got it in those things if you read on some of those you got it in there to where that Jesus in the story is told that he's down making little birds of clay and somebody walks up and he goes and they just come alive and fly off but where did that squirrel come from that your Prophet said it came into existence and he said I ate him right or maybe he said we because he probably give to somebody but you see I thought that he said I got it away on over in the message that he said let me say this from my own Revelation it's out of the seal book think is God in Simplicity I'm not certain he said let me say this he said according to my own Revelation I won't say he told me he according to my own Revelation said one day limbs will be restored okay you got a hand missing it's done been put in the ground or some dog ated or something where is that coming back from brother Mo said he sat with AA Isen and watched him and the man said everybody bow your head he said I didn't bow mine I sat and looked he said I was up close to the front and I wanted to see he said I looked at that boy or who who it was there and he said 6 Ines he said I watched him he said it growed right out oh they just faked that he had his leg pulled up and then go right ahead play all you want to see because you don't believe it can be done I believe it can be done I don't care if that was a fake right right I don't care if that was a fake I believe it can be done remember he asked a little girl I believe it was he said or prayed for her she had no eyeballs in her sockets and he prayed for her and he stopped he went back he said oh honey said by the way said what color eyes do you want she had heard of Stories of the sky and the things I'm sure how beautiful it was and she said I want blue eyes he said immediately the eyes appeared in the socket do we believe that God can still create cuz remember now my point is from that time that he created a physical creation then anything that's created now will come from the same original creation that that came into being from are you with me and that it was put here in the earth and could do but he can go right back to the original let's stand you see Church we've had a wonderful God to bring us a wonderful message for us to be able to see that he's still God and that Faith truly is the substance this world came into being by the word of God that word of God was spoken from the mouth of almighty God that could bring into existence what was in his mind from no existence whatsoever of anything before he didn't take a rock take it over and make a do and make an earth and multiply and build it up he just spoke it into B the prophet said if under the blood of bulls and goats flies fleas and frogs could come into be a creative act from the words of a man named Moses he said where why would we stumble at squirrels being spok into existence under the blood of Jesus Christ oh I sit there this morning look at I won't get to it this evening but Abel's Revelation could speak does your Revelation speak can you tell me your Revelation well now brother Dale I've got this great Revelation but I can't explain it we just go on till you can you're not impressing me and I'm doing my best to explain what I believe I believe in the Eternal God one who existed all by himself back in the eternities of eternities before eternity was ever even thought about you ever heard the prophet say in the beginning before the Eternal now that's the supernatural being before the Eternal because that's a word we use right I believe this world came from that world or whatever you want to call it what do we got 381 3 381 this power anybody have a need world is not my home just a passing through my treasures are laid somewhere beond after the god I believe in a real God angs me why would we stumble when the prophet would say the new word is the person of Jesus Christ coming and living in you not my Lord what will I do the Angels beckon me from why would we stumble about speaking the word try that Wednesday night to get you SI and let you speak of your own Revelation fix were things that happen you know you had nothing to do with it something else was taking place you know I I believe the god of Glory can still speak I believe he can create what about you what do you think about God you say well God is just a spirit then that's what you believe viory you believe he's just a spirit and you're more real than he is see how dumb we are Heaven anybody have what will I do the Angels Be Me from heaven open door and I feel in this world oh Lord you know I have no friend like you if Heaven's not my home but you see we've always wanted to go up right well what if you down on the other side of the earth which your way are you going you say that's dumb you explain it but on the other side of the earth they're pointing up you can't explain that somebody is looking down are there is a supernatural Dimension that is controlling all things that allows all of us to look up you see I don't want to go up there I want him to come down here I stopped many many years ago you heard me say it said I'm not going to try to go to heaven anymore people looked at me I said because I believe Heaven's going to come here right here is the center of the whole thing believe that then whatever is out there that's just our playground that one day we can just Journey down through Brother G there will be no tiredness and we can walk up to Mars to Venus whatever and we look things over you realize if you brought this Earth so many feet closer to the sun right now it would burn up you realize if you moved it so many feet away from the Sun it would freeze over but do you realize if you started moving it toward the sun until you reached a certain spot you're going to freeze come on is it not cooler up around Delan Blue Ridge right now than it is here you know why because of the higher elevation you see if we went in towards the sun we think we just immediately burn no there's a freezing atmosphere then a burning up because we're set in a perfect place right where we're supposed to be because God framed it that what Paul said framed it put it in the place that it can be used you know one other definition even says makes it fat I like that one because I'm fat what do we think what kind of a god do you have I believe God is real he's not a thought of your imagination he's real lord Jesus we thank you for what you have brought unto us we've tried to explain it Lord we know and realize that it takes a revelation to understand that the worlds were actually framed by the word of God that where we're at right now is the actual place that you wanted it to be before the world ever begun you made this Earth to be inhabited according to your word Lord let us just be the people that inhabit it go with us as we eat a natural meal bring us back together this afternoon we love you we thank you in Jesus name amen you dismissed Mir
