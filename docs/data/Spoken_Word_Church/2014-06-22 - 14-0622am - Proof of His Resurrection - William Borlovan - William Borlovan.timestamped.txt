[2:58] then upon the circumcision only or upon
[3:02] the uncircumcision also for we said that
[3:06] Faith was reckoned to Abraham for

[3:18] circumcision
[3:20] uncircumcision and he received the sign
[3:22] of circumcision a seal of righteousness
[3:25] of Faith which he had yet being
[3:28] uncircumcised
[3:30] that he might be the father of all them
[3:34] that
[3:34] believe though they be not circumcised
[3:38] that righteousness might be imputed unto
[3:41] them
[3:42] also and the father of circumcision to
[3:46] them that are not circumcised on but who
[3:51] also walk steps of the Faith of Our

[16:09] telling my brother Bob we'd be here for
[16:11] so long kept you know we had every
[16:13] intention of being here so we finally
[16:15] made it after about seven years or so
[16:17] and uh I was joking with brother Bob you
[16:19] know I said well now you know God is Not
[16:21] subject to time and we're his creatures
[16:23] so we're not subject to time so don't
[16:25] hold it against me amen but we're here
[16:28] and we're so thankful to be here my wife
[16:31] and I have enjoyed ourselves so much and

[16:36] Saints of like Precious Faith we're
[16:39] gathered you know we may all come from
[16:40] different backgrounds we may all come
[16:42] from different families but we all come
[16:44] from God the same father amen that's
[16:47] that's what makes us all brothers and
[16:48] sisters and that's that's what makes us
[16:50] have Fellowship because we come God has
[16:52] allowed for each of us to be brought up
[16:54] in a certain background to bring about
[16:56] certain qualities in each and every one
[16:57] of us and to bring us in amen so God
[17:00] bless you again this morning I'm
[17:02] probably gonna say that many other times
[17:03] before we close because brother B said
[17:06] that's the that's that's the greatest
[17:07] thing you could tell somebody was to God
[17:09] bless them because he said if God
[17:11] blesses me that's all I need amen amen
[17:14] so we're going to begin this morning
[17:16] reading out of three different places
[17:18] first place is going to be Colossians
[17:20] chapter
[17:26] 1 second place is going to be in
[17:29] Ephesians I'll give you a minute to get
[17:31] there I've even got to take a
[17:36] minute third place is going to be Romans
[17:40] chapter
[17:51] 8 we start with
[17:53] Colossians 1: 16 the Bible reads for by
[17:58] him him were all things created that are
[18:00] in heaven and that are in Earth visible
[18:03] and invisible whether they be Thrones or
[18:05] dominions or principalities or
[18:08] Powers all things were created by Him
[18:11] and for him and he is before all things
[18:13] and by him all things consist and he is
[18:16] the head of the body the church who is
[18:18] the beginning the firstborn from the
[18:21] dead that in all things he might have
[18:23] the preeminence amen amen over in
[18:26] Ephesians the 1st chapter 17
[18:30] verse that the god of our Lord Jesus
[18:33] Christ the father of Glory may give unto
[18:36] you the spirit of wisdom and Revelation
[18:38] and the knowledge of him the eyes of
[18:41] your understanding being enlightened
[18:43] that you may know what is the hope of
[18:45] his calling and what the riches of the
[18:47] glory of his inheritance in the Saints
[18:50] and what is the exceeding greatness of
[18:52] his power to us word who believe
[18:54] according to the working of his mighty
[18:56] power which he hath wrought in Christ
[18:58] Christ when he raised him from the dead
[19:01] and set him at his right hand in
[19:02] Heavenly places far above all
[19:04] principality and power and might and
[19:06] dominion and above and every name that
[19:09] is named not only in this world but also
[19:11] in that which is to come and hath put
[19:13] all things under his feet and gave him
[19:15] to be the head over all things to the
[19:18] church which is his body the fullness of
[19:22] him that filth all in all and Romans 8
[19:25] one verse there Romans 811 but if the
[19:28] spirit of him that raised up Jesus from
[19:32] the dead dwell in you thank Jes he that
[19:34] raised up Christ from the dead shall
[19:37] also Quicken your mortal bodies by his
[19:40] spirit that dwelleth in you amen amen
[19:42] let's go in prayer dear most gracious
[19:44] Heavenly Father Lord we're so thankful
[19:46] to you again for this opportunity Lord
[19:48] to be gathered in your name father God
[19:50] and to look into these things and we're
[19:52] so thankful to you oh God that you've
[19:53] called us as an end time people Lord to
[19:56] to walk where the wise people Lord and
[19:57] the Sages of Ages gone by could only
[20:00] could not walk father we're so thankful
[20:02] that you've called us up higher than
[20:03] that father you've come you've opened
[20:05] your word to us Lord I pray oh God that
[20:08] you just help me Father God help your
[20:10] people help us to get out of the way may
[20:12] your spirit have preeminence in this
[20:13] service oh God we pray we love you Lord
[20:16] and we just ask that you again bless
[20:17] each and every one in Jesus Christ's
[20:19] name we pray and ask all these things
[20:20] amen amen God bless you as you're
[20:24] seated I want to speak this morning on
[20:28] the sunrise which is the proof of his
[20:32] resurrection amen because we know that
[20:36] Jesus raised from the dead a lot of
[20:39] people say he raised from the dead but
[20:42] there's a way to know that he raised
[20:44] from the dead
[20:45] amen because God does not just if if he
[20:49] does something he's going to prove
[20:50] because God brother Ram said that God
[20:52] proves his
[20:54] word and we're taught by the prophet in
[20:56] the church age book that God cannot
[21:00] change that is the theme of the whole
[21:02] message that Hebrews 138 is that God
[21:05] can't Jesus Christ is the same yesterday
[21:08] today and forever amen and brother Ram
[21:11] said the Keystone of the Bible is that
[21:13] God cannot
[21:14] change so once we get a revelation in
[21:17] our hearts that God cannot change how he
[21:21] acts the first time is how he must act
[21:23] each and every single time Amen brother
[21:26] brandom called himself a
[21:28] apologist another word for that is
[21:31] scriptural because brother Brandon was
[21:33] able to look at what God did the first
[21:34] time in type and see what God was going
[21:37] to do throughout the entire Bible
[21:39] because God does not
[21:40] change that is how he was able to
[21:45] identify God coming down to Abraham in a
[21:48] body of Flesh to discern the thoughts of
[21:50] Sarah's Hearts because he did that then
[21:52] and he was able to identify he seen the
[21:54] picture he seen that God was in flesh
[21:57] coming to his bride Discerning the
[21:59] thoughts of Sarah's hearts and he seen
[22:01] the two angels that went down to Blind
[22:03] Sodom and Gomorrah so he looked in the
[22:05] Bible and he said well what's next the
[22:07] fire's got to fall right exactly and
[22:09] that's what's going to happen because
[22:10] God does not change right he's seen how
[22:14] Joseph was treated by his Brethren how
[22:16] he was rejected by his Brethren he read
[22:18] how he took a gentile wife and was able
[22:20] to preach the entire Bible from that
[22:22] single story exactly because God does
[22:24] not change that is the Keystone is that
[22:27] God does not change
[22:30] amen so it's important that we know our
[22:34] place in the scripture right it is
[22:36] important that we know our
[22:38] identification in the scripture because
[22:41] that is what brings perfect
[22:44] Faith Jesus himself knew his place in
[22:47] scripture right amen Jesus was subject
[22:50] to his own word come on right Jesus was
[22:54] subject to his own word and you know
[22:58] whatever the head goes through the body
[23:00] must also go through because where the
[23:02] head goes the body follows amen so
[23:06] everything that Jesus experienced we
[23:08] must experience amen he found his place
[23:11] in scripture we've got to find our place
[23:13] in scripture he suffered and he left a
[23:16] little suffering for the bride as
[23:18] well because we are his body come on
[23:22] amen he we are his body so when we're
[23:25] able to find our place in the scripture
[23:28] then we're able to tell what's going to
[23:30] happen we're able to see what has been
[23:33] you know we're we're in this situation
[23:35] this is what God's doing next we are
[23:37] able to prophesy based on the Bible come
[23:41] on brother isn't that what Revelations
[23:43] 10 8 to1 we eat the book and then we
[23:47] prophesy Revelations 10 1-7 is Jesus
[23:50] Christ descended with the Shout with
[23:53] seven Thunders amen that and he came and
[23:55] fulfilled that and what's the other part
[23:56] it's the bride's part 8 to 11 right
[24:00] that's what the head done now the body
[24:02] is supposed to eat the book right and
[24:04] then she can prophesy again right when
[24:07] she eats the book and knows she
[24:09] recognize her day and her message she
[24:12] recognizes the presence of God didn't
[24:15] the prophet preach a message the
[24:17] presence of God unrecognized sir he
[24:20] comes and does the same work that he did
[24:22] 2,000 years ago and they don't recognize
[24:25] it bless
[24:28] right brother brand in the message
[24:29] future home of the Heavenly
[24:32] bridegroom in verse 267 there he says
[24:37] and if you are bride the Bride is a part
[24:40] of the husband right and the only place
[24:43] that you'll ever recognize it is
[24:44] recognize what part of that husband that
[24:47] word that you are or you can't recognize
[24:50] being bride thank you Lord how many sees
[24:52] that see see you have to recognize your
[24:57] position come on because if you don't
[24:59] recognize your position you don't know
[25:01] where you
[25:02] stand and then the devil can beat you
[25:05] around but Jesus when Satan came to
[25:08] Jesus Jesus knew exactly who he was he
[25:11] knew exactly where he stood yes
[25:13] siren and he fought off the devil's
[25:15] Temptations he defeated the
[25:19] enemy on down in the same same sermon
[25:22] there in
[25:23] 270 verse 270 said then Jesus said in
[25:26] John 14 when he the Holy Ghost has come
[25:30] he will bring these things to your
[25:31] memory see show you what day you're
[25:33] living in and then another thing you'll
[25:36] know him by he'll show you things to
[25:38] come see right back to the prophetic
[25:40] again when he's come see thank you
[25:44] lordess the Holy Ghost will tell the
[25:46] bride will show the bride exactly where
[25:48] she's living we show her in the
[25:50] scripture that this Jesus Christ is
[25:52] doing this this is what he did this is
[25:54] the day and hour you're living in that's
[25:56] right true because that is how the
[25:58] foolish virgins missed the Rapture is
[26:01] because they don't recognize the
[26:02] importance of the
[26:03] oil until it's too late and then they
[26:07] try and go get oil on but it'll be too
[26:10] late
[26:12] right and the trumpet gives an uncertain
[26:17] sound Jesus brother Ram saying again he
[26:20] said destroy this Temple and I'll see
[26:23] what I can do about it he's asking the
[26:25] question you destroy this Temple and I
[26:28] will raise it up again in 3 days nothing
[26:31] uncertain now I'll try you all might
[26:34] stand around and see if I can do it or
[26:35] not I know I will raise it up nothing
[26:39] uncertain I will raise it up you destroy
[26:41] it I'll raise it up oh my why he know
[26:45] that he was that person in the scripture
[26:46] that David spoke of I will not leave his
[26:49] soul in Hell neither will I suffer my
[26:51] holy want to see corruption amen and he
[26:54] knew he was included in that scriptural
[26:56] promise so therefore he was
[26:59] positive because Jesus knew exactly
[27:02] where he stood that's why in Luke
[27:05] chapter 4 he can go and stop exactly at
[27:07] what part of the verse pertained to him
[27:09] in his day and then say this day this
[27:13] scripture is fulfilled in your
[27:15] ears the Pharisees and the religious
[27:17] people of that day were still trying to
[27:18] look at what Moses said right Moses
[27:21] spoke of him but they had already
[27:23] Twisted it all around that's right he
[27:26] said brother r says this he says now
[27:28] can't we be that
[27:30] positive we take him example for other
[27:33] things as long as God's word said it
[27:34] can't we be as positive about the word
[27:36] as he was about it I am the re I am the
[27:39] resurrection and life I will raise it up
[27:42] again amen why he know the word spoke of
[27:44] it and he was sure to come forth if I'm
[27:47] the person over there in John
[27:49] 5:24 he that Hearth my word and
[27:51] believeth on him that sent me has
[27:53] everlasting life and I will raise him up
[27:55] again at the last days he'll not cometh
[27:57] to judgment pass from death into life
[28:00] that that's us what are we scared about
[28:03] what's the matter amen so as long as
[28:07] Satan can keep you from knowing where
[28:09] you stand he's got you amen exactly but
[28:12] when you realize your position because
[28:13] with position comes
[28:16] Authority because Jesus was able to cast
[28:19] Satan out by the Finger of God because
[28:20] he knew he was God amen
[28:23] glory he knew exactly who he was he knew
[28:27] what in his message he knew what he had
[28:29] to fulfill he knew that he had to come
[28:32] be expressed in flesh die be buried be
[28:35] raised again he knew
[28:37] that and the bride knows what's got to
[28:39] be done she knows there's got to be a
[28:42] Rapture amen so the question is are we
[28:46] preparing for the Rapture right because
[28:50] that is what's at hand right amen right
[28:54] we're not trying to build an ark right
[28:57] no that was God's plan at one time but
[28:59] it's not anymore that's
[29:01] right you know God sent a prophet he
[29:04] fulfilled Malachi
[29:05] 4 and we praise him for that but he
[29:09] fulfilled Malachi 4 so now he's got to
[29:11] fulfill other scriptures he's got to
[29:13] fulfill 1 Thessalonians
[29:16] 4:17 exactly the Rapture that's what's
[29:19] next right we're not looking for God to
[29:22] send Malachi 4:5 because he already
[29:25] did so if you're looking look at Malachi
[29:28] 45 still looking for Malachi 45 and not
[29:31] accepting God's Malachi 45 his
[29:34] interpretation of it then you're missing
[29:36] the
[29:36] mark
[29:39] right so we know that the church is the
[29:42] body of Jesus Christ and everything that
[29:43] he did she must do she must go where the
[29:46] head goes
[29:48] exactly so the church after the day of
[29:52] Pentecost began its Ministry just like
[29:54] Jesus did and all signs and its wonders
[29:57] right healing the people amen yes people
[30:00] are all excited but we find that after a
[30:03] while that the Sanhedrin Council and the
[30:05] different religious organizations of the
[30:06] day were trying to constantly arrest
[30:08] that word they were constantly trying to
[30:10] put him in prison just like they did
[30:12] Jesus they trying when he say something
[30:14] against their belief he they try and
[30:15] stone him they'd actually pick up stones
[30:18] and go to Stone him but he slipped
[30:19] through the crowd because his time
[30:21] wasn't yet am every detail of Jesus's
[30:24] life was based upon this word right on
[30:27] when it was
[30:28] time he went to the Cross but before
[30:30] then he didn't because in the Garden of
[30:33] Gethsemane he tells the disciples he
[30:35] said you know know you not that I could
[30:37] call 12 or talk to my father and he'll
[30:39] presently send me 12 Legions of angels
[30:41] but he said but that the scripture might
[30:43] be fulfilled he couldn't do it right see
[30:46] Jesus was subject to his own word right
[30:48] exactly and brother brandham was also
[30:51] subject to his own message because it
[30:52] wasn't from him he had to listen to his
[30:55] own sermons I've heard him on tapes say
[30:57] that he had to go back and listen come
[30:59] on sure because he was like a microphone
[31:01] yep exactly and God just spoke through
[31:03] him yes sir and sometimes he'd have to
[31:06] even repeat what he' say he would even
[31:08] you know after he say something he go
[31:10] praise God let me say that again he was
[31:13] getting it just as fresh as we
[31:15] were you know God would meet him in a
[31:17] vision or give him a message but when he
[31:19] stepped up in that anointing came forth
[31:21] come on he was getting
[31:23] it he was getting it so after three and
[31:27] A2 years they finally crucify the
[31:30] Messiah so I want to type that CU you
[31:32] know brother Bram tells us that we type
[31:36] Enoch and the church World types Noah as
[31:39] they go through the tribulation or over
[31:40] it or through it rather and we're
[31:42] delivered but at this in other instances
[31:44] we also type Noah because we are in the
[31:47] ark which is Christ so it all depends
[31:49] what angle you're taking it on because
[31:51] the bride just like every scripture
[31:53] points to Jesus Christ Glory but the
[31:56] bride will see sealed in Jesus Christ
[31:58] just like Eve was sealed in Adam so when
[32:00] you look in the scriptures and you see
[32:01] Jesus Christ we've got to see our own
[32:03] identification in
[32:05] there we must see our own
[32:08] identification so just as they got Jesus
[32:12] after three and a half years they
[32:13] finally got what they
[32:14] wanted so the church ages after three
[32:18] Church ages it went into a Dark Age they
[32:21] finally got their way right right amen
[32:24] they finally got their way the church
[32:25] World finally got their way and got the
[32:27] compromise they wanted and got the
[32:29] influence that they wanted at Nasa right
[32:32] in the message
[32:33] Masterpiece
[32:35] 1964 brother BR says at that night I see
[32:38] a council of 15 days of bloody
[32:40] politician debate when them Aristocrats
[32:42] come in and wanted to inject these big
[32:44] dignitaries into the church and the
[32:46] prophets come out of that Wilderness
[32:48] there eating herbs and wrapped in animal
[32:50] skins genuine prophets and they throw
[32:52] them out why the seed has got to fall
[32:55] into the ground it's got to die it died
[32:59] in the Dark Ages down beneath the dirt
[33:01] the dark dirt they thought it was gone
[33:03] you know St John 12:24 Jesus said except
[33:05] the corn of wheat falls into the ground
[33:07] it abides alone and the first church was
[33:09] that reproduction that bride that seed
[33:12] that word made manifest that fell into
[33:14] the ground at n of Rome listen Church
[33:17] throughout the Nations that will hear
[33:18] this there is your dirt right is them
[33:22] denominations there is where the word
[33:24] was crucified and they accepted dogma
[33:26] and for hundreds and hundreds of years
[33:28] of Dark Ages the power and manifestation
[33:30] of the word was hid from the world only
[33:33] Catholicism ruled we all know that as
[33:35] reading history only Catholicism rules
[33:38] right exactly right so do you see how
[33:42] the scriptures repeating itself yes
[33:43] that's right after three and a half
[33:45] years they got Jesus They Crucified him
[33:47] and he went in the Tomb with the Roman
[33:49] seal right and after three Church
[33:52] ages they got the word and they broke it
[33:55] down mhm and they took over the nicadan
[33:59] spirit you see that in the church age
[34:02] book so now the word he said brother Ram
[34:05] said here that they crucify the word and
[34:06] that it was in denominational dirt
[34:09] because Jesus said and his words can't
[34:11] fail that except the corn of wheat fall
[34:13] in the ground it abideth alone so that
[34:15] corn of wheat had to go in the ground
[34:17] just like he went in the ground because
[34:20] until Jesus died and was resurrected the
[34:23] Holy Ghost could not come exactly they
[34:26] had one man to deal with but after the
[34:27] day of Pentecost they had 120 because
[34:30] that corn of wheat went into the ground
[34:32] and when it came back up it was in a
[34:34] multiplied form yes sir so the church
[34:37] has to go through the same thing because
[34:38] she's the body so after three after
[34:41] three ages she goes in the dirt yep y
[34:44] just like he
[34:47] did in the message restoration of the
[34:49] brid
[34:52] tree said now
[34:54] notice after 3 days the first tree
[34:57] restored is at the beginning having the
[34:58] same signs same wonders Jesus come back
[35:01] the same Jesus doing the same thing at
[35:04] the end of the third day the signs
[35:06] appeared not at the end of the first day
[35:08] oh brother remember these days are the
[35:11] these days are typed as ages or the ages
[35:13] are typed as days exactly he said oh
[35:16] brother I hope you're getting it at the
[35:19] third day is when the real manifestation
[35:21] of Christ was made known at the end of
[35:24] the third day amen see notice are you
[35:26] getting it he says not at the first day
[35:29] dead form second day there was a rumor
[35:32] see the second day was still dead Luther
[35:33] Wesley at the beginning of the third day
[35:35] there was a rumor around all right
[35:38] nothing on the first day Luther nothing
[35:40] on the second day and in the third day
[35:43] the dispensation of the Holy Spirit
[35:44] there was a rumor around that he was the
[35:46] same yesterday today and forever because
[35:48] the Pentecostal age started with the
[35:49] restoration of the gifts so after all
[35:52] this time people begin to see the
[35:54] manifestation of the spirit in ways that
[35:56] they had not seen it so it began to be a
[35:58] rumor right he said but at the end of
[36:02] the third day that's where he made
[36:04] himself known come right among them come
[36:07] right among his people and said look at
[36:09] me I'm the same one amen yes sir so you
[36:13] see there's been another Resurrection
[36:14] right brother Bram said that that they
[36:17] have named it Sunday Su n day before the
[36:20] bride It's s o n
[36:23] Sunday because there's been it is the
[36:26] rising of the
[36:28] sun amen it's the rising of the
[36:32] Sun so the body we see the bride going
[36:35] through the same stages the very same
[36:38] stages that Jesus Christ went
[36:42] through right there in the Dark Ages
[36:44] coming on up and then there's to be a
[36:46] resurrection right
[36:51] sure in the message it is the rising of
[36:54] the
[36:55] Sun because remember Jesus when he was
[36:58] resurrected he was only identified right
[37:01] when he did the same works right right
[37:04] that was the only way that you know
[37:06] because we have to believe him by faith
[37:08] abely so when Jesus Christ himself was
[37:11] manifested in the flesh he had to do
[37:14] what was written of him right AB and it
[37:17] was the
[37:18] people's job to study the scriptures and
[37:22] to see the Messiah manifested when he
[37:25] came because all they had was what was
[37:27] written that's correct yes and it's easy
[37:29] to say well Believing on Jesus 2,000
[37:31] years ago would be a whole lot easier
[37:32] because he was physical in the flesh but
[37:35] that's not necessarily the
[37:36] case it took just as much Faith to
[37:39] believe that Jesus was God then as it
[37:42] does
[37:43] now because all he was was a
[37:45] manifestation of the word so when people
[37:47] seen him they said that can't be God how
[37:50] can God allow people to spit in his face
[37:52] y yep how can God be on a cross yeah
[37:57] come on brother but he was manifesting
[37:59] the
[38:00] word so because remember when Jesus
[38:03] asked Peter who do Man asked his
[38:05] disciples who do Man say that I the son
[38:06] of man am right everybody had a
[38:09] different interpretation of who he was
[38:11] some Isaiah some Jeremiah some one of
[38:13] the prophets some a teacher they knew
[38:15] something was there but they didn't
[38:16] quite not everyone really
[38:19] understood but the elect of the day was
[38:21] able to identify and say I know Thou Art
[38:24] the Christ the son of the Living God
[38:27] right the Bible did not describe the
[38:28] physical appearance of Jesus other than
[38:30] just to say that there's no beauty that
[38:32] we should desire him right right but the
[38:35] true description of the Messiah was his
[38:37] fulfillment of scripture right amen and
[38:40] when he fulfilled the scripture to the
[38:43] letter that was identification of the
[38:46] Messiah he gave the signs of the Messiah
[38:49] amen and we're about to get into that he
[38:51] gave his signs and he done what the
[38:53] scripture fulfilled and yet for all that
[38:55] people still were blinded at that was
[38:56] the Messiah yes sir that's right they
[38:59] claimed that they were Moses's disciples
[39:01] but if they would have been Moses's
[39:02] disciples they would have believed on
[39:04] Jesus if they were true Disciples of
[39:06] Moses because Moses spoke of
[39:10] him Moses spoke of
[39:14] him because they rejected the word and
[39:16] when they rejected Jesus they said we
[39:18] are moses' disciples we don't know who
[39:20] you are we believe Moses their very
[39:23] actions prove they did not believe Moses
[39:26] they were religious yeah come on but
[39:29] they were not the elect right
[39:34] amen they were not the
[39:37] elect let's go
[39:39] to St John this is the morning of the
[39:42] Resurrection St John chapter 20 and as
[39:45] we go along I want us to
[39:48] look and identify ourselves in the
[39:50] scripture amen right because brother
[39:52] Bram said that Elijah was sent to the
[39:54] widow woman because she had the same
[39:55] nature he did right right amen so we're
[39:58] able to see when you read a story in the
[40:01] Bible and you see right there because
[40:03] remember we're sealed into Christ
[40:06] yep we are sealed into Christ and we
[40:08] must put ourselves right there right
[40:10] because
[40:11] Ahab had three Syrian
[40:15] campaigns three military campaigns
[40:17] against the syrians and Ahab types the
[40:19] United States as we know oh yeah in
[40:22] between the second and third Syrian
[40:24] campaign Elijah comes and condemns he
[40:27] and
[40:27] Jezebel and then Ahab dies on the third
[40:30] Syrian campaign and his blood runs out
[40:32] in the Chariot in the evening time right
[40:34] right amen right and
[40:37] Kennedy see brother brandham had to be
[40:39] on earth at the time that Kennedy was
[40:41] manif was President because he had to be
[40:44] there because it was that way in the
[40:45] Bible Elijah was on Earth at the time
[40:48] when Ahab and Jezebel was on the throne
[40:51] the prophet of God was on the earth at
[40:52] the time that Kennedy went into office
[40:55] right he didn't have nothing against
[40:56] Kennedy as a man but he knew the spirit
[40:58] behind that he could see it in the
[41:02] scriptures so Ahab died in the evening
[41:04] time between the second and third Syrian
[41:06] campaign amen the campaigns typing the
[41:09] Wars three world wars and Kennedy was
[41:12] shot in his car in his Chariot and his
[41:15] blood ran in the Chariot so do you see
[41:18] the exact scriptures repeating itself
[41:21] exactly so we place ourselves there in
[41:25] between the second and third campaign
[41:26] and see that Elijah came out and
[41:28] condemned Jezebel and Ahab
[41:32] amen see we place ourselves there in the
[41:34] scripture when Elijah in 2 Kings 8 went
[41:37] to a widow woman when she had seven
[41:39] years of famine let's go to Second Kings
[41:42] because I want to I want to drive this
[41:44] in Amen to where you really
[41:48] understand 2 Kings 8 sorry brother Joe
[41:51] that wasn't I didn't originally have
[41:52] that
[41:55] down
[41:58] I want to read this so that we can
[42:00] understand of how old testament stories
[42:02] point to Modern Times And we identify
[42:06] ourselves with them scriptures
[42:08] amen 2 Kings
[42:12] 8 then spake Elisha unto the woman whose
[42:16] son he had restored to life saying arise
[42:18] go thou in thine household and sojourn
[42:20] wheresoever thou can sojourn for the
[42:22] Lord hath called for a famine and it
[42:24] shall come upon the land seven
[42:27] years and the woman arose and did after
[42:30] the saying of the man of God so she went
[42:31] with her household and sojourned the
[42:33] land of the Philistines seven years we
[42:35] know a woman in the Bible types A church
[42:37] right in verse three and it came to pass
[42:40] at the seven years end that the woman
[42:43] returned out of the land of the
[42:44] Philistines and she went forth to cry
[42:47] unto the king for her house and for her
[42:49] land and the King talked with Gesa the
[42:51] servant of the man of God saying tell me
[42:54] I pray thee all the great things that
[42:55] Elisha ha done and it came to pass as he
[42:58] was telling the King how he had restored
[43:00] a dead body to life that behold the
[43:02] woman whose son he had restored to life
[43:04] cried to the king for her house and for
[43:06] her land and Gesa said my Lord oh King
[43:09] this is the woman and this is her son
[43:11] whom Elisha ha restored and when the
[43:14] king asked the woman she told him so the
[43:16] king appointed unto her a certain
[43:18] officer saying restore all that was hers
[43:22] and all the fruits of the field since
[43:23] the day that she left the land even
[43:25] until now so she was gone for seven
[43:28] Church ages and then the king God
[43:31] himself appointed a certain officer his
[43:33] Prophet to the bride to restore
[43:35] everything that she lost in the seven
[43:37] years all seven Mysteries
[43:40] amen so let's get back to St John 20
[43:44] this is the morning of the
[43:46] Resurrection so we identify ourselves
[43:49] with that widow woman who was restored
[43:51] by that officer that God
[43:54] appointed so we Place ourselves there in
[43:56] the scripture and we see the exact exact
[43:59] thing because remember the Keystone God
[44:01] does not
[44:03] change exactly come on St John chapter
[44:06] 20 we'll start with verse
[44:10] 11 but Mary this is the morning of the
[44:13] Resurrection but Mary stood without at
[44:16] the Seiler weeping and as she wept she
[44:19] stood down and looked into the
[44:21] seeler and seen two angels in white
[44:25] sitting one at the head and the other at
[44:28] the feet remember that would be like
[44:30] Paul and brother brandom oh
[44:34] yeah two angels there remember this is
[44:36] the morning of the resurrection and
[44:38] we're at the morning of the Resurrection
[44:40] it is the rising of the Sun so let's
[44:42] keep this in mind as we read here and
[44:44] see the events as they
[44:46] transpire because Alpha is Omega Jesus
[44:48] is not associated with part word like he
[44:51] is with full word he's full word and
[44:53] Alpha is Omega right and he really
[44:57] identifies himself with a pillar of fire
[44:59] at the beginning of the age and at the
[45:00] end of the age that's right
[45:05] am where in verse 12 where the body of
[45:09] Jesus had
[45:10] Lain and then over there in Luke you
[45:13] know the story is told a little
[45:14] differently they're told the angel tells
[45:16] them why seek ye the living among the
[45:18] dead and that's a good question to the
[45:22] bride why and as an individual why seek
[45:25] ye the living among the dead if Jesus
[45:27] ain't in the Tomb then where is he right
[45:30] he's got to be somewhere because if he's
[45:33] not in the Tomb that means he raised
[45:35] right amen so if you want life you've
[45:38] got to be where Jesus is because he is
[45:40] the light amen
[45:42] glory so the Bible them angels in Luke
[45:45] you can just write this down 245 tells
[45:47] them why seek ye the living among the
[45:52] dead and they say unto her woman why
[45:55] weepest thou
[45:56] she says unto them because they have
[45:58] taken away my Lord and I know not where
[46:01] they have laid him and I want us to
[46:03] remember Mary types the church the bride
[46:06] specifically exactly Mary types the
[46:09] bride because brother Bram said and pick
[46:10] up your pen and write that the word was
[46:12] in The Bride amen she received the
[46:15] Spoken Word By An Angel and became
[46:17] pregnant with the word
[46:19] right and the bride is to do the same
[46:21] thing
[46:22] amen because God's continuity does not
[46:24] change it cannot be
[46:28] broken and when in verse 14 and when she
[46:30] had said thus she turned herself
[46:35] back now remember Mary being a type of
[46:38] the church the Angels told him why seek
[46:40] ye the living among the dead she didn't
[46:42] know where Jesus was and she turned
[46:45] herself back and saw Jesus standing and
[46:48] knew not that it was Jesus right people
[46:51] would come out of the denominations when
[46:54] brother Ram was on Earth and knew knew
[46:56] that God was doing something right but
[46:58] couldn't quite put their finger on it
[46:59] they just knew God was on the
[47:02] move so the bride turned around they
[47:05] seen Jesus standing there the message
[47:08] but they didn't quite understand
[47:12] yet Jesus saith unto Heroman why weepest
[47:16] thou whom seekest thou she's supposing
[47:18] him to be the Garder sayith unto him sir
[47:22] if thou have borne him hence tell me
[47:24] where thou has laid him and I will will
[47:25] take him away yeah so Mary is seeing
[47:29] Jesus but she's not recognizing who
[47:31] Jesus
[47:32] was not yet right verse 16 Jesus saith
[47:37] unto her
[47:39] Mary she turned herself and saith unto
[47:41] him raboni which is to say
[47:44] master when she heard her name called
[47:48] she knew that Jesus that was Jesus
[47:51] resurrected he didn't brother Ram say
[47:53] when we hear the word of our day we've
[47:54] heard from our theophany
[47:56] you hear you say how do I hear my name
[47:58] how what does it mean that I find my
[48:00] name in the book it means to find your
[48:02] identification in the book that's right
[48:05] because we're sealed in Jesus Christ sir
[48:10] exactly what I just read in 2 Kings 8
[48:13] one of the many examples is a perfect
[48:16] example of
[48:18] identification you say well God that's
[48:20] seven seven years that's seven Church
[48:22] ages there's been a
[48:24] famine the word been hidden the word's
[48:26] been closed up they just had portions
[48:28] but at the end of the seven years at the
[48:30] end of Lady OA God appoints an officer
[48:32] to restore everything
[48:34] back so you see yourself there and you
[48:37] identify yourself with that scripture
[48:40] Glory God sent her Elijah and God sends
[48:45] us Elijah who was a widow because our
[48:47] first husband is dead should be right
[48:50] the denominations
[48:52] right if it's not the only way to be
[48:55] married to Jesus Jesus is for your first
[48:56] husband to be
[48:58] dead and that could be you know
[49:00] worldliness that can be a life of sin
[49:03] that can be religion right right that
[49:06] can be denominational religion that
[49:08] could be message religiosity right
[49:11] because remember that brother brandham
[49:12] said that God does not have
[49:13] grandchildren right amen so even though
[49:17] back then he was dealing with the
[49:18] Pentecostals and he said God does not
[49:20] have Pentecostal grandchildren the same
[49:22] thing applies to the message that's
[49:24] right God does not have message
[49:26] grandchildren right amen everybody must
[49:29] come the same way no matter what
[49:32] right the prophet of God himself had to
[49:35] come the same
[49:36] way God does not make an exception for
[49:40] anyone so we see that Jesus called her
[49:42] name out of the book and when he did she
[49:45] immediately identified him as Jesus then
[49:48] she said Master she knew based on what
[49:51] he told her right that identified him as
[49:54] the Resurrected the Lord Jesus Christ
[49:57] amen Jesus said that my sheep know my
[50:00] voice and a stranger they will not
[50:03] follow that's right Mary was a sheep of
[50:06] God and she heard the voice of her
[50:08] master and turned around and knew it was
[50:10] Jesus because before he spoke to her she
[50:13] didn't know who he was right and think
[50:16] of this she seen him in the flesh before
[50:18] his crucifixion right but after his
[50:20] resurrection she didn't know until he
[50:22] did the same works so you cannot
[50:25] not classify or identify Jesus Christ by
[50:29] crown of thorns and nail scars or
[50:32] anything it's got to be by the same
[50:34] Works he is the same yesterday today and
[50:37] forever Glory where the same works are
[50:40] done that's where he's
[50:42] at that's where he's
[50:52] at let's go to Luke chapter 24
[50:59] another interesting thing is that when
[51:02] you read you'll see that after the
[51:04] resurrection of Jesus he only identified
[51:07] himself in secret right yeah before his
[51:10] resurrection he was open with things
[51:12] he'd go and he'd heal but after the
[51:14] resurrection only the elect seen him
[51:17] right exactly the Jews paid off the
[51:18] Roman soldiers to say that some that the
[51:20] Jew that they came and stole his body
[51:23] Jesus never appeared to cus anymore
[51:25] right he never appeared at the St hedrin
[51:27] anymore it was then only to the elect
[51:29] that seen him that's
[51:31] right they knew he raised from the dead
[51:34] because he appeared to them he proved
[51:37] his resurrection to them because God
[51:39] don't have to prove nothing to
[51:42] Satan right but brother Ram said that
[51:44] God proves his word glory and we are his
[51:47] word made manifest
[51:49] Glory he's going to come and get us out
[51:52] of here he's going to come and he
[51:53] whispers his secrets to us that's right
[51:55] the husband doesn't whisper secrets to
[51:57] any woman it's only to his
[52:00] wife so after the resurrection in Luke
[52:07] 24 verse
[52:09] 25 this was on the road to
[52:12] emus remember they walked all day with
[52:15] him and didn't know it was him
[52:16] absolutely yes sir all day with him and
[52:19] he started expanding to them scriptures
[52:20] and they had no idea it was him until he
[52:23] done something that was familiar right
[52:25] am and when it was familiar what he did
[52:27] before his resurrection their eyes were
[52:30] opened but until then they didn't they
[52:33] weren't open in verse
[52:35] 25 and certain of them which
[52:38] were okay he's talking over there to
[52:41] them on the road to emus he's coming on
[52:43] down and then Jesus tells them after he
[52:44] starts open up the scriptures he said
[52:46] then he said unto them oh fools and slow
[52:48] of heart to believe all that the
[52:49] prophets have spoken ought not Christ
[52:52] have suffered unto these ought not
[52:54] Christ have suffered these things and to
[52:56] enter into his glory then he begins the
[52:58] scripture and beginning at Moses and all
[53:00] the prophets he expounded unto them and
[53:02] all the things all the scriptures the
[53:05] things concerning himself he didn't
[53:08] expound the things concerning Moses and
[53:10] things because they were in type of who
[53:12] he
[53:14] was Moses and Elijah and Noah they were
[53:17] all a type pointing to something amen
[53:20] their lives were led by the Holy Ghost
[53:22] to point to Jesus Christ as a shadow in
[53:25] a
[53:28] type verse 28 and they drew nine to the
[53:31] Village whether they went and he made as
[53:33] though he would have gone further but
[53:34] they constrained him saying abide with
[53:36] us for it is toward evening and the day
[53:39] is far spent and he went into to Terry
[53:41] with them in the evening time and it
[53:44] came to pass as he sat at meat with them
[53:46] he took bread and blessed it and break
[53:48] it and gave to them he did something
[53:50] familiar right and their eyes were
[53:53] opened and they knew him and he vanished
[53:56] out of their
[53:57] sight and they said one to another did
[53:59] not our hearts burn within us while he
[54:02] talked with us by the way and while he
[54:03] opened to us the
[54:06] scriptures that's when Jesus broke the
[54:08] bread he gave it to him their eyes came
[54:09] open wait a minute this is what he said
[54:12] before that they would they could never
[54:14] understand when Jesus would talk about
[54:15] his death even Peter tried to hinder him
[54:17] yeah they did not understand
[54:22] right they had not understand to this
[54:24] full capacity especially right so after
[54:27] they begin to understand then opened he
[54:30] the scriptures and after he break the
[54:32] bread their eyes were opened and they
[54:35] knew
[54:36] him because not because they saw Jesus
[54:40] remember he walked with them in a
[54:42] physical manifestation all day long and
[54:45] they didn't know it exactly until he did
[54:48] what he did
[54:49] yesterday and that identified him as
[54:54] Jesus
[54:55] and that identifies him as Jesus every
[54:57] time is when the word that was written
[55:00] for the hour is made
[55:02] manifest true the ark was Jesus Christ
[55:06] when Noah preached because that was the
[55:08] word of the hour
[55:10] amen and people couldn't see nothing but
[55:12] an old man building a ship they missed
[55:14] the mark amen but he was preaching the
[55:19] message of the hour the message of the
[55:21] hour should be no new term because the
[55:23] me there's been a message for every hour
[55:26] right that's no new term that's no new
[55:29] word Jesus was the message of the hour
[55:32] he is the message of the hour Jesus was
[55:35] the message of Noah's
[55:37] hour Jesus was the message of Noah's
[55:39] hour on he tied both the Passover they
[55:42] were eating and the blood that protected
[55:43] them from the death angel he's all in
[55:46] all yes amen he was the message of the
[55:49] hour amen and he is the message of the
[55:51] hour so how can somebody try and
[55:54] separate God from his word
[55:55] word how can somebody try and separate
[55:58] the message from the Bible come on
[56:01] because the message is a manifestation
[56:03] of what was written right come on the
[56:06] message makes this live because the
[56:09] Bible says that the letter kth but it's
[56:11] the spirit that giveth
[56:14] life everybody that claims Christianity
[56:17] has
[56:18] this but only the bride really
[56:21] understands manifestation of it the body
[56:25] of
[56:26] Christ because the head the body has to
[56:28] do what the head did
[56:32] does the body depends on the head to
[56:35] move right the body can't move without
[56:38] the head the head is the controlling
[56:40] Tower and they that are led by the
[56:42] Spirits by the by the spirit of God are
[56:44] the sons of God
[56:47] Amen so the same chapter in Luke
[56:51] 24 this is another
[56:53] instance
[56:55] verse 36 and as they and as they thus
[56:59] spake Jesus himself stood in the midst
[57:01] of them and saith unto them peace be
[57:03] unto you and they were terrified and a
[57:05] frightened and supposed that they had
[57:06] seen a spirit they didn't recognize
[57:09] him and he said unto them why are you
[57:12] troubled and why do thoughts arise in
[57:14] your hearts behold my hands and my feet
[57:16] it is I myself handle me and see for
[57:18] Spirit hath not Flesh and Bones as you
[57:20] see me have and when he had thus spoken
[57:23] he shed unto them his hands and his feet
[57:25] and while they yet believed not for Joy
[57:27] wondered he said unto them have ye any
[57:29] meat and they gave unto him a piece of
[57:31] broiled fish and an honeycomb right and
[57:34] he took it and did eat before them and
[57:36] he said unto them these are the words
[57:39] which I spake unto you while I was uh
[57:41] yet with you that all things must be
[57:44] fulfilled which were written in the law
[57:45] of Moses and in the prophets and in the
[57:49] Psalms concerning me then opened he
[57:52] their scriptures then opened he their
[57:54] understanding that they might understand
[57:56] the scriptures after the resurrection
[57:59] right come on before they didn't
[58:01] understand right he spoke in Parables
[58:03] and he'd even try and break it down for
[58:05] the disciples but their understanding
[58:07] was
[58:08] still they didn't understand it right
[58:11] but after his resurrection he opened the
[58:13] scriptures to them and that is how he
[58:15] was identified as the
[58:17] Messiah not walking all day on the road
[58:20] to emus they thought he was just a
[58:22] traveler right not when Mary met at the
[58:25] tomb she thought he was the gardener
[58:28] right brother R preached a message who
[58:30] is
[58:32] this when he came in that Palm Sunday
[58:36] the whole city was in an uproar who is
[58:42] this let's go to another
[58:45] scripture St John
[58:53] 21
[58:56] these are all scriptures after his
[59:01] resurrection because that is the hour
[59:03] we're living in right I'm trying to by
[59:07] the grace of God to to show
[59:10] you how we're living in the same
[59:12] time because this was after the head was
[59:16] resurrected after 3 days so now he's
[59:19] coming this end time to prove his same
[59:21] word in the same way when his church the
[59:24] body has been resurrected by the same
[59:26] quickening power Romans
[59:28] 8:11 if that same spirit that raised up
[59:31] Jesus from the dead dwell in you then it
[59:34] will Quicken your mortal bodies so if
[59:37] the spirit that raised Christ from the
[59:38] dead don't Quicken and uh doesn't dwell
[59:41] in an individual or in a church they
[59:44] won't be
[59:47] raised St John
[59:50] 21:3 this is after his crucifixion the
[59:53] disciples brought discouraged just like
[59:55] they were on the road to emus think of
[59:58] how defeated it looked to the Flesh in
[1:00:01] the natural eye right everything they
[1:00:04] had hoped for everything that they that
[1:00:05] they just imagined in their mind a
[1:00:07] preconceived notion that Jesus would do
[1:00:09] it just abruptly ended When They
[1:00:11] Crucified him but that was
[1:00:14] Victory it was absolutely Victory so
[1:00:17] they're all
[1:00:19] discouraged in verse three Simon Peter
[1:00:21] saith unto them I go a fishing they say
[1:00:24] to him we also go with thee they went
[1:00:27] forth and entered into a ship
[1:00:28] immediately that night they caught
[1:00:30] nothing and when the morning was now
[1:00:32] come Jesus stood on the shore but the
[1:00:34] disciples knew not that it was Jesus
[1:00:37] right then Jesus saith unto them
[1:00:40] children have he any meat they answered
[1:00:43] him no and he said unto them cast the
[1:00:47] net on the right side of the ship and he
[1:00:49] shall
[1:00:51] find all right now hold your spot right
[1:00:53] there and let's go to Luke 5 just hold
[1:00:55] your finger right
[1:00:57] there because Jesus they didn't
[1:00:59] recognize Jesus on the shore but in Luke
[1:01:04] 5 just a couple verses there in four and
[1:01:07] six they're fishing the same thing Y and
[1:01:10] when he had left speaking we'll start
[1:01:12] verse
[1:01:13] three and he entered into one of the
[1:01:15] ships which was Simon's and he prayed
[1:01:17] him that he would Thrust out a little
[1:01:18] from the land and he sat down and taught
[1:01:20] the people out of the ship now when he
[1:01:22] had left speakon he said unto Simon
[1:01:24] launch out to the deep and let down your
[1:01:25] nets for a drought and Simon answering
[1:01:28] said unto him Master we have tolled all
[1:01:31] night and have taken nothing
[1:01:32] nevertheless at Thy word I will let down
[1:01:35] the net and when they had done this they
[1:01:37] enclosed a great multitude of fishes
[1:01:40] that their net
[1:01:41] break that's what he did before his
[1:01:44] crucifixion and his resurrection right
[1:01:46] so that's experience they never forgot
[1:01:49] so back to St John they were doing the
[1:01:51] same thing they were fishing Jesus came
[1:01:53] on the boat they didn't recognize him
[1:01:54] right and in verse six Jesus tells them
[1:01:56] and he said unto them cast the net on
[1:01:58] the right side of the ship and he shall
[1:01:59] find they cast therefore and now they
[1:02:02] were not able to draw it for the
[1:02:04] multitude of
[1:02:05] fishes does that sound familiar Hebrews
[1:02:09] 138 that's what he did before
[1:02:12] exactly therefore the disciple whom
[1:02:15] Jesus loved saith unto Peter it is the
[1:02:17] Lord y amen John immediately said wait a
[1:02:21] minute the man told us to cast The Net
[1:02:23] that's what he did before he raised from
[1:02:25] the dead that's
[1:02:26] Jesus because he did the same thing amen
[1:02:30] right now when Simon Peter heard that it
[1:02:33] was the Lord he GED his father's coat
[1:02:35] unto him for he was naked and cast into
[1:02:37] the sea and the other disciples came in
[1:02:40] a little ship for they were not far from
[1:02:42] Land as it were 200 cubits dragging the
[1:02:44] net and as soon as they were come to
[1:02:46] land they saw a fire of coals there and
[1:02:48] the fish lay thereon in bread and Jesus
[1:02:52] saith unto them bring up bring up the
[1:02:54] fish which you have now caught Simon
[1:02:56] Peter went up and Drew the net to the
[1:02:58] land full of great fishes and 150 and
[1:03:01] three for there were so many yet was not
[1:03:04] the net net broken exactly because Jesus
[1:03:07] said that all that the father had given
[1:03:09] me will come to me he's not going to
[1:03:11] lose any of them right because remember
[1:03:14] brother Ram teaches us that when the
[1:03:15] gospel is preached or when a call is
[1:03:18] made you've got fish you've got spiders
[1:03:20] you've got Turtles you've got water bugs
[1:03:22] but there's real fish in there too right
[1:03:24] that's right over here it was fish and
[1:03:26] the Bible said that the net was not
[1:03:27] broken there's not one of them that's
[1:03:29] lost
[1:03:31] right Jesus saith unto them come and
[1:03:34] dine and none of his disciples Dar ask
[1:03:37] him who art thou knowing that it was the
[1:03:40] Lord Jesus said come and D we're living
[1:03:43] in a come and D age amen we're living in
[1:03:46] a come and dime age and we know that
[1:03:49] it's the
[1:03:50] Lord there might have been some guessing
[1:03:52] way back at first but now we know it was
[1:03:55] the Lord right and no man D to ask is it
[1:03:58] the Lord because we know right we know
[1:04:01] he resurrected from the dead because he
[1:04:03] does the same thing
[1:04:08] right so see without the
[1:04:10] resurrection there'd be no quickening
[1:04:12] power without the resurrection there'd
[1:04:15] be no identification in scripture like
[1:04:16] this without the resurrection there'd be
[1:04:19] no message there'd be no there'd be no
[1:04:21] seven Thunders there'd be no seals
[1:04:22] there'd be nothing without that quick
[1:04:24] power because the same quickening power
[1:04:26] that raised Jesus from the dead broke
[1:04:28] the seals on it's the same quickening
[1:04:31] power because he done it himself and
[1:04:34] Jesus said I have power to lay my life
[1:04:36] down and I've got power to raise it up
[1:04:38] that's right he laid the church down and
[1:04:41] he raised her up right because he laid
[1:04:43] himself down because that corn of wheat
[1:04:45] had to fall into the ground and that
[1:04:48] confuses carnal minded people too yeah
[1:04:51] that how could God do them things and
[1:04:52] let the people go through that dark Dark
[1:04:54] Age but there was an anointing for that
[1:04:56] amen they were anointed to be sacrificed
[1:04:59] with that Ox anointing right
[1:05:02] amen he said in the message it is the
[1:05:04] rising of the
[1:05:07] sun he said as Christ was the first one
[1:05:11] to
[1:05:11] raise from all the prophets and so forth
[1:05:15] although typed in many places he was the
[1:05:17] first fruits of them that slept in the
[1:05:20] bride coming of Christ coming out of the
[1:05:23] church have to be a sheath waved again
[1:05:25] in the last days oh my waving the sheath
[1:05:29] what was the sheath the first one that
[1:05:31] come to mature the first one that proved
[1:05:33] it was a wheat and that proved it was a
[1:05:36] sheath Hallelujah I'm sure you see what
[1:05:38] I'm talking about it was waved over the
[1:05:40] people and the first time there will
[1:05:41] come forth for the bride age for a
[1:05:44] resurrection out of dark
[1:05:45] denominationalism will be a message that
[1:05:48] the full maturity of the word is turned
[1:05:50] back again and his full power being
[1:05:52] waved over the people by the same signs
[1:05:54] and wonders that he did back there
[1:05:57] amen because I live ye shall live also
[1:06:00] you live also speaking to his wife see
[1:06:03] he wasn't just speaking that to the
[1:06:04] church right right it was to his wife
[1:06:07] Glory right because I live ye live also
[1:06:10] what a resurrection that was and what a
[1:06:12] resurrection this is to be quickened
[1:06:14] from the dead to be made alive in Christ
[1:06:16] Jesus by God's quickening power he was
[1:06:19] waved to them the word which he was was
[1:06:22] waved back to them on the day of
[1:06:23] Pentecost the word made manifest now as
[1:06:26] I say it's to be waved again in the last
[1:06:30] day and brother brandom is not God he's
[1:06:34] bride is that right but he was the first
[1:06:37] one that came to maturity in the age and
[1:06:39] he was waved over the people and the
[1:06:41] bride is to walk in the same
[1:06:43] steps now that's not to say we're going
[1:06:45] to have a Ministry where we deser and
[1:06:47] thought that was for him but we're going
[1:06:49] to walk in the same places of believing
[1:06:50] God like no one else can because he
[1:06:53] stood stood Pat upon the word when
[1:06:55] everyone else walked away you remember
[1:06:57] in in my new ministry he talks about
[1:06:59] where Deus has forsaken me and everyone
[1:07:01] has forsaken him just like with Jesus
[1:07:04] everybody loved the fishes in the Loa
[1:07:06] everybody loved getting healed but when
[1:07:08] it came to the word they walk away from
[1:07:10] it and the Word was the whole point
[1:07:12] right but see how that word makes all
[1:07:15] the rest of them all the you know the
[1:07:17] first and second pull attracts the
[1:07:18] little fish right attracts them and
[1:07:20] things and then it scares all all of
[1:07:21] them when it comes to that third pool
[1:07:23] which what catches the fish which is
[1:07:25] what catches the fish in the net here
[1:07:27] right that they were bringing
[1:07:29] up the rainbow
[1:07:37] trout now the body as I said has got to
[1:07:40] have the exact same ministry as the head
[1:07:42] does correct amen because it is the same
[1:07:46] right now Jesus had three pools is that
[1:07:51] right brother R teaches us that that
[1:07:52] Jesus had three pulls
[1:07:55] and the and brother random had three
[1:07:56] pools because it's Jesus Christ the same
[1:07:58] yesterday today and
[1:07:59] forever now there's
[1:08:02] also three phases of the third pool
[1:08:05] right you have speaking the word that's
[1:08:08] the third pool you said let there be a
[1:08:10] squirrel God created it that was the
[1:08:12] third pool when he opened the Seven
[1:08:15] Seals that was the third pool
[1:08:18] right preaching to the souls in prison
[1:08:21] is also the third
[1:08:22] pool he said that in Souls that are in
[1:08:25] prison now he's talking about Noah and
[1:08:27] his heart is breaking he said God could
[1:08:28] it be this third pole when this message
[1:08:30] is preaching to those who can never be
[1:08:33] saved and he refers to all three as the
[1:08:35] third pool now Jesus cursed the F tree
[1:08:40] right he opened the word and he went to
[1:08:43] hell to preach to the souls that were in
[1:08:45] prison abely and the bride has got to do
[1:08:48] the same
[1:08:50] thing because we are his body am that's
[1:08:53] right
[1:08:54] Hebrews 138 Jesus Christ is the same
[1:08:57] yesterday and today and
[1:09:00] forever that scriptures quoted a lot and
[1:09:02] it should be brother Braham used it a
[1:09:04] lot but when you really get it anchored
[1:09:06] down you realize the importance of that
[1:09:08] scripture as all of them right because
[1:09:11] if he wasn't the same yesterday today
[1:09:13] and forever how could we know how to
[1:09:15] expect how could we expect uh how should
[1:09:17] how can we know how God's going to
[1:09:20] act but brother Bram was able to pick up
[1:09:23] the story of Abraham and Sarah and
[1:09:25] Joseph in the very first book of the
[1:09:27] Bible and preach it all the way to
[1:09:29] Revelations with 144,000 because God
[1:09:32] does not change with that very principle
[1:09:33] amen that's
[1:09:35] right that very principle right there
[1:09:38] that God does not change you know
[1:09:40] brother Brandon was so
[1:09:41] humble you know I hear so many
[1:09:43] testimonies where he said he always
[1:09:45] where people to say he always made the
[1:09:46] other person feel big and you and you
[1:09:49] and you can hear him on tape where God
[1:09:51] had given him the responsibility to
[1:09:53] bring bring the word for an age to call
[1:09:55] out his wife yet he makes it act like
[1:09:58] he's just I just have a seventh grade
[1:10:00] education all these brothers are so much
[1:10:02] more qualified than me I'm a typologist
[1:10:04] I don't have the education to get in
[1:10:06] there like these other brothers do but
[1:10:08] he was the one that God had sent he had
[1:10:10] more Revelation then people had theology
[1:10:12] but he had
[1:10:13] Revelation and that's the thing is when
[1:10:16] someone just follows this message
[1:10:18] intellectually yeah they can be talked
[1:10:21] out of it just like they were obviously
[1:10:23] talked into it but when you get the
[1:10:26] message and you bring it back to the
[1:10:27] Bible and you weave it together it's
[1:10:29] impossible to separate because the
[1:10:32] message is the interpretation of what
[1:10:34] was written amen yes sir so that shows
[1:10:37] that we're intellectual to begin with
[1:10:39] because if someone if you're doing
[1:10:41] something in the best way that you think
[1:10:43] and someone else and tells you there's a
[1:10:45] better way to build a
[1:10:46] house well you were just this is all you
[1:10:49] knew so you're going to go by it but
[1:10:52] when it's been revealed to you
[1:10:54] there's no there's no talking you out of
[1:10:56] it because it's a part of
[1:10:59] you and how could you deny
[1:11:02] yourself impossible no St John chapter
[1:11:07] one I want to bring this down
[1:11:11] now to not only Jesus's first
[1:11:14] resurrection but also the resurrection
[1:11:16] of the word the day on bring it down to
[1:11:21] our day because that's how the Bible
[1:11:22] should be read that's how the Bible
[1:11:24] should be interpreted and that's how the
[1:11:25] Bible should be understood is what's
[1:11:27] going on today I appreciate what God did
[1:11:30] yesterday but what is he doing now I
[1:11:32] appreciate what he's going to do but
[1:11:34] what is he doing
[1:11:35] now and remember the prophet of God said
[1:11:37] that's the problem is that people are
[1:11:39] always praising God for what has been
[1:11:41] they love what he's going to do but
[1:11:42] they're ignoring the thing that he's
[1:11:43] doing
[1:11:45] right ignoring the things that he's
[1:11:49] doing St John chapter 1 we start verse
[1:11:52] 40
[1:12:01] the son of the Messiah that's how they
[1:12:02] recognize
[1:12:08] Jesus this was after John the Baptist
[1:12:11] identified Jesus one of the two
[1:12:14] disciples which heard John speak
[1:12:15] followed him which was Andrew Simon
[1:12:17] Peter's brother he first findeth his own
[1:12:19] brother Simon and saith unto him we have
[1:12:21] found the Messiah which is being
[1:12:22] interpreted the
[1:12:24] Christ and when he brought him to Jesus
[1:12:26] and when Jesus beheld him he said Thou
[1:12:29] Art Simon the son of Jonah that Shall be
[1:12:32] Called sephus which is by interpretation
[1:12:34] a
[1:12:35] stone the following day Jesus findeth
[1:12:37] Jesus would go forth into Galilee and
[1:12:39] findeth Philip and he saith unto him
[1:12:41] follow me and Philip was of BEDA in the
[1:12:44] city of Andrew and Peter Philip findeth
[1:12:46] Nathaniel and saith unto him we have
[1:12:47] found him of whom Moses and the law and
[1:12:50] the prophets did write Jesus of Nazareth
[1:12:53] the son of son of Joseph now you see
[1:12:55] Nathaniel's confession when he seen the
[1:12:57] sign of the Messiah is that this is who
[1:12:59] Moses wrote of when the Pharisees and
[1:13:01] other religious orders of the day seen
[1:13:03] it they said that was be
[1:13:05] elub and they both claimed to be
[1:13:07] Disciples of Moses oh yeah so who were
[1:13:10] the true Disciples of Moses those that
[1:13:12] went on with the word because Jesus said
[1:13:15] if you continue in my word then are ye
[1:13:17] my
[1:13:19] disciples verse 46 and Nathaniel saith
[1:13:22] unto him can there be any good things
[1:13:23] come out of Nazareth Philip saith unto
[1:13:25] him come and see Jesus saw Nathaniel
[1:13:28] coming to him and saith of him behold an
[1:13:30] Israelite indeed of whom there is no
[1:13:32] G Nathaniel saith unto him whence
[1:13:35] knowest thou me Jesus answered and said
[1:13:38] unto him before the Philip called thee
[1:13:40] when thou was under the Fig Tree I saw
[1:13:42] thee Nathaniel answered and saith unto
[1:13:44] him Rabbi Thou Art the Son of God Thou
[1:13:47] Art the king of
[1:13:49] Israel Nathaniel knew he was a student
[1:13:52] of the scripture and he was expecting
[1:13:54] the
[1:13:55] Messiah so he was not going by how Jesus
[1:13:58] was looked but when he heard the sign of
[1:14:01] the Messiah when he witnessed it for
[1:14:04] himself he said Thou Art the Christ the
[1:14:06] son of the Living God Thou Art he that
[1:14:08] was written Thou Art he that was
[1:14:10] supposed to come to pass that was
[1:14:11] prophesied of right and he did the same
[1:14:14] sign for the nation of Israel right but
[1:14:18] what was different is what their
[1:14:19] attitude was toward it right it that was
[1:14:22] the difference amen we know the story of
[1:14:24] the woman at the well the same thing
[1:14:26] amen and remember a woman types the
[1:14:28] church come on the woman was coming with
[1:14:30] her water part to get water to get
[1:14:33] Spirit she seen herself in
[1:14:35] need and God himself was there Amen in
[1:14:39] flesh right and he discerned her
[1:14:44] life and he told her that I give you
[1:14:46] water that you don't come here to draw
[1:14:48] right amen you don't come to this sister
[1:14:50] here to
[1:14:51] draw I'll give you what but she'll never
[1:14:53] thirst again because when she identified
[1:14:57] him as the
[1:14:58] Messiah she left her water
[1:15:00] pot she didn't e it anymore right cuz
[1:15:04] she found the water she was looking for
[1:15:05] amen that's what the church has done
[1:15:08] right because Jesus said that he'll give
[1:15:10] Everlasting water out of his belly shall
[1:15:12] flow
[1:15:13] rivers and a water pot you only have it
[1:15:15] for a little while you keep having to
[1:15:16] come back from one Revival to the next
[1:15:19] but she had rivers of ever flowing river
[1:15:22] of water
[1:15:25] so we see the the the sign of the
[1:15:27] Messiah that Jesus manifested to the
[1:15:29] nation of Israel amen so now that was
[1:15:33] what he did yesterday so now I want to
[1:15:36] read quotes to where you see what he's
[1:15:38] doing today what he did
[1:15:41] right and then see if you can discern
[1:15:44] that that is the same Messiah that they
[1:15:46] crucified 2,000 years
[1:15:48] ago in the message do you now
[1:15:52] believe
[1:15:55] brother RS in a prayer line and only the
[1:15:57] prophet of God could go in the scripture
[1:16:00] tell the story about the woman at the
[1:16:01] well about Phillip about Abraham and
[1:16:04] then he himself turned his back to the
[1:16:05] audience and do it right and do you know
[1:16:08] that people that obvious of a
[1:16:10] manifestation people still missed it and
[1:16:13] disbelieved preached for an hour or two
[1:16:16] about Sarah and Abraham about God coming
[1:16:18] down in flesh before Sodom was destroyed
[1:16:20] turn his back and discern Sarah's
[1:16:22] thoughts and he himself do it right and
[1:16:25] they still missed
[1:16:28] it he said now just a
[1:16:31] moment I heard a name your husband is
[1:16:35] his first name Lewis or something
[1:16:37] anybody said Lewis is that right and I
[1:16:39] see your house number it's 631 at 45th
[1:16:42] Street it's right here at Palm Beach is
[1:16:44] that right and you're going to be well
[1:16:46] and Jesus Christ makes you whole God
[1:16:49] bless you your faith your faith saved
[1:16:51] you lady now go on believing him just be
[1:16:54] reverent and have faith and on down and
[1:16:57] looking for
[1:17:00] Jesus quote 72 he said yes sir you
[1:17:04] believe me to be his Prophet you might
[1:17:06] have a mighty good faith and now you are
[1:17:07] suffering with stomach trouble is that
[1:17:08] right it's caused from a peptic
[1:17:10] condition in your stomach that's right
[1:17:12] you are also a very nervous person

[1:17:21] condition isn't that right and you also
[1:17:23] have heart trouble is that right you

[1:17:47] Messiah right amen he done the same
[1:17:49] thing
[1:17:51] exactly and he's doing it after his
[1:17:54] resurrection he told them to cast their
[1:17:56] net on the right side of the boat yeah
[1:17:59] right is a special Ministry that comes
[1:18:01] to the bride in this end
[1:18:07] time let's go to St Matthew
[1:18:17] 21 21:
[1:18:21] 18
[1:18:26] now in the morning as he returned into
[1:18:28] the city he hungered and when he saw a
[1:18:31] thick tree in the way he came to it and
[1:18:33] found nothing thereon but leaves only
[1:18:35] and he
[1:18:36] said let no fruit grow on thee hence
[1:18:39] hence Forward Forever and presently the
[1:18:42] Fig Tree withered
[1:18:44] away Jesus spoke the
[1:18:46] word to that fig tree and when the
[1:18:49] disciples saw it verse 20 they Marvel
[1:18:50] saying how soon is the Fig tree withered
[1:18:53] away now that was God in Jesus speaking
[1:18:57] authority to Creation on he spoke to
[1:19:00] that thick tree and said no man eat of
[1:19:02] you from from this day
[1:19:03] forth and that thick tree obeyed him
[1:19:05] that was the spoken word right Jesus
[1:19:08] spoke the word to creation and it obeyed
[1:19:13] him in the message Hebrews chapter
[1:19:17] 2 brother R is talking about the
[1:19:21] fish and a few weeks ago I seen a fish
[1:19:23] killed laying on the water all of you
[1:19:26] heard the story of it there's brother
[1:19:27] woods and his brother and them standing
[1:19:29] here to witness it that little fish
[1:19:31] laying dead for half an hour on the
[1:19:32] water with his anils pulled out of his
[1:19:34] mouth and the great Holy Spirit swept
[1:19:36] down and he said the day before you're
[1:19:37] going to see the resurrection of a
[1:19:39] little animal and the next morning after
[1:19:41] a little after sun up we saw that little
[1:19:43] fishy not over that long when the spirit
[1:19:45] of the Lord came down and said little
[1:19:47] fish Jesus Christ makes you whole and
[1:19:49] that dead fish had been floating on top
[1:19:51] of the water for practically a half hour
[1:19:54] and came to life and swam away as hard
[1:19:56] as he could oh blessed be the name of
[1:19:58] the Lord how wonderful he
[1:20:00] is so you have Jesus exercising the
[1:20:03] spoken word over fig Tre there and
[1:20:06] you've got Jesus exercising his
[1:20:08] authority over creation here it's the
[1:20:11] same thing it's the spoken word because
[1:20:13] only God can give
[1:20:15] life and life comes by the spoken word
[1:20:18] right that's
[1:20:20] true creation comes by the spoken word
[1:20:23] mhm come on because God didn't write let
[1:20:26] there be light he said let there be
[1:20:28] light amen and that word cannot return
[1:20:31] back to him
[1:20:33] void just like you know over there in in
[1:20:35] Jeremiah where Isaiah talks about as as
[1:20:38] the snow falls as the rain falls and it
[1:20:40] fulfills its purpose it's not going to
[1:20:42] come back to God void he said so will my
[1:20:45] word right and the bride is the spoken
[1:20:47] word of Jesus Christ and she sent to the
[1:20:50] Earth to do what he purposed for her
[1:20:53] amen and she's not going to come back
[1:20:54] empty-handed she's not going to get that
[1:20:56] talent and go bury it
[1:20:58] somewhere she's going to get that Talent
[1:21:00] she's going to multiply it she's going
[1:21:02] to invest it she's given so we are
[1:21:04] responsible for what we're given for
[1:21:07] exactly the word and the Revelation that
[1:21:09] God gives you you are responsible for
[1:21:12] it right so we can't God forbid that we
[1:21:16] be ashamed of what we believe well God
[1:21:18] forbid that he gives Revelation well
[1:21:20] that's wonderful but let me bury and not
[1:21:21] tell nobody oh my
[1:21:23] come on Revelation belongs to No One it
[1:21:25] belongs to God and he gives it
[1:21:27] sovereignly and when you God reveals
[1:21:30] something to you in whatever form it is
[1:21:33] whether it's a prayer it's a song it's a
[1:21:36] sermon it's reading your Bible listening
[1:21:38] to the prophet it's your responsibility
[1:21:40] to tell somebody about it it is your
[1:21:43] responsibility to believe it and go
[1:21:46] invest it oh not bury it
[1:21:50] on because you know what happened to
[1:21:52] that servant that buried it he was
[1:21:54] afraid to go and and invest it that's
[1:21:57] right
[1:21:59] y so we know the story of Jesus for the
[1:22:03] sake of time when he went out in the
[1:22:05] ship and there arose a
[1:22:07] storm and he was tired as a man and he
[1:22:09] fell asleep in the boat and the storm
[1:22:11] was coming the disciples were afraid
[1:22:13] they were about to die it was tossing he
[1:22:15] was so tired he didn't even wake up
[1:22:16] where the disciples go and they wake him
[1:22:18] up Y and Jesus said peace be still
[1:22:22] that's right and the disciples
[1:22:24] marveled because all of creation obeyed
[1:22:28] Jesus because he was
[1:22:30] God and we see that God comes down this
[1:22:32] time and gives the same authority to his
[1:22:34] Prophet
[1:22:36] exactly remember when he he warned the
[1:22:38] bre and he said the snow storm's coming
[1:22:40] in 30 minutes or so you're not going to
[1:22:41] be able to see your hand in front of
[1:22:42] your face as soon as the first uh sleep
[1:22:45] or snow or snowflakes fall you get down
[1:22:46] from the mountain he had already had it
[1:22:48] all set up and he himself had to get
[1:22:51] down and he started going down and the
[1:22:53] spirit of the Lord told him to turn
[1:22:54] around and go back where you
[1:22:58] were you talk about trusting God and
[1:23:00] knowing because he was walking right
[1:23:02] back into what looked like death exactly
[1:23:06] God told him to turn around and go back
[1:23:09] and he just at there that's all he knew
[1:23:10] what to do you know the the that U that
[1:23:15] lady that brother R talks about you know
[1:23:17] that ancient Mama about about how she
[1:23:19] knew that she was looking for that
[1:23:21] elishah she identified selfelf in the
[1:23:23] scripture with the widow woman and she
[1:23:26] had a son that needed help right right
[1:23:29] so she said Lord you know where's your
[1:23:31] Elijah right absolutely see that
[1:23:34] identification with the word with the
[1:23:36] power of it brought Elijah to her right
[1:23:39] and she got her son restored cuz she she
[1:23:42] told Brother brandom she said eyes like
[1:23:43] that shunamite woman right y she
[1:23:46] identified herself in the scripture amen
[1:23:49] and looked for that Elijah to come amen
[1:23:52] and brother brandom the spirit of the
[1:23:53] Lord told him to keep walking he had a
[1:23:55] plane to catch right but the spirit of
[1:23:56] the Lord told him to keep walking right
[1:23:58] glory and he kept walking and that PL
[1:24:01] that plane was delayed because of the
[1:24:04] faith of that
[1:24:05] woman that Faith was delayed I'm sorry
[1:24:08] the plane was delayed that's right see
[1:24:10] how powerful faith is so God gave the
[1:24:13] authority to his Prophet to speak to a
[1:24:15] storm
[1:24:18] right let me read it cuz he says it best
[1:24:21] he says I will s there I thought why
[1:24:23] would you want me to come up here I
[1:24:25] doubt very much I can find my way down
[1:24:27] now getting so
[1:24:29] terrific I could see about 10 or 15t
[1:24:32] maybe could hardly and hardly that far
[1:24:34] sometimes not over 5T getting rougher
[1:24:36] all the time well I thought well he said
[1:24:38] come back all I know to do is sit here
[1:24:40] and the snow then about an inch or inch
[1:24:42] and a half maybe two inches on the
[1:24:43] ground it' been about 20 or 30 minutes
[1:24:46] and it was blowing so hard it was
[1:24:47] blowing it away too and I just sat there
[1:24:50] just a moment and I Heard a Voice voice
[1:24:53] he said I am the god of Heaven who
[1:24:55] created heavens and earth I jerked off
[1:24:58] my hat cap and I just kept still set
[1:25:01] still and I listened again I thought
[1:25:02] that wasn't the wind oh it was blowing
[1:25:04] making noise and I heard it again said I
[1:25:06] am the one who steal the winds upon the
[1:25:09] Mighty
[1:25:11] Sea is the same Jesus he said I am the
[1:25:14] one the Creator I created squirrels in
[1:25:17] your presence I did these things I said
[1:25:20] yes Lord I believe you said stand up on
[1:25:22] your feet I stood up on my feet to my
[1:25:25] feet he said now speak to the
[1:25:28] storm it'll do what you'll tell it to
[1:25:31] do now that is true I when I meet you at
[1:25:35] the Judgment I'll have all this to
[1:25:36] answer for I said storm go to your
[1:25:40] place stop and son you shine normally
[1:25:43] for 4 days and no more than I said that
[1:25:46] the sleep and Hell which was about to
[1:25:47] blow me down just stopped and within a
[1:25:49] moment or two the Sun was shining right
[1:25:51] down thre upon
[1:25:54] me the spirit of the Lord came and told
[1:25:58] the prophet of God I am the one that
[1:26:00] steal the waters I am the one that Ste
[1:26:02] that steal the storm there in the gospel
[1:26:05] the same yesterday to today and forever
[1:26:07] now you speak right and calm the storm
[1:26:11] right the same yesterday today and
[1:26:15] forever and you can take that and run
[1:26:18] with that and apply it to every area of
[1:26:20] your life because brother brand
[1:26:22] represents the bride storm is what's
[1:26:24] going on with you come on you stand up
[1:26:27] and you speak to it amen and it'll obey
[1:26:29] you yes amen because the spirit that was
[1:26:33] in Jesus to make him calm the storm was
[1:26:36] the same one that was in brother Brandon
[1:26:37] that made him calm the storm and it's
[1:26:39] the same one and the Holy Ghost filed
[1:26:40] believer to make you calm your storm
[1:26:43] it's the same thing so see here's an
[1:26:47] example of a story out of the message
[1:26:49] that you can identify yourself with amen
[1:26:53] because the word of God is eternal glory
[1:26:55] you can identify yourself how many
[1:26:57] people how many times do we hear
[1:26:58] testimonies of people receiving healings
[1:27:01] from being called out in the prayer line
[1:27:03] with the same condition right yeah
[1:27:05] sitting down standing up maybe even
[1:27:06] wearing the same clothes right and they
[1:27:09] receive their healing amen because God
[1:27:11] is Not subject to
[1:27:17] time so we had the resurrection of Jesus
[1:27:20] Christ he came and he secretly made
[1:27:21] himself number KN only to his disciples
[1:27:24] come on brother only to his disciples
[1:27:27] the one the cist and all the ones that
[1:27:29] all the Romans and everyone that
[1:27:30] crucified him knew no more than nothing
[1:27:33] right even Josephus said talked about uh
[1:27:35] the communion about how they took the
[1:27:36] body of Jesus and were eating it and
[1:27:38] things carnal don't understand right but
[1:27:41] the Believers the 120 on the day of
[1:27:43] Pentecost understood very
[1:27:45] well amen but he went only to his elect
[1:27:49] right everyone else didn't believe
[1:27:51] righten if the disciples there Peter and
[1:27:54] John try to go tell a an acquaintance
[1:27:57] about what happened how Jesus rose from
[1:27:58] the dead and how he put the net and told
[1:28:00] them and witnessed to them if they were
[1:28:02] not elect well you just imagine that
[1:28:04] right I don't believe it it was only for
[1:28:07] the elect
[1:28:09] amen it was only for the elect so Jesus
[1:28:13] resurrected he made himself known in
[1:28:15] secret to his disciples amen now let's
[1:28:18] go to Matthew
[1:28:21] 27
[1:28:24] and just watch how beautiful the order
[1:28:25] of the scripture is because that cannot
[1:28:27] be
[1:28:31] broken Matthew
[1:28:39] 27 verse we'll start with verse 51 and
[1:28:42] behold the veil of the temple is rent
[1:28:44] and Twain From the top to the bottom and
[1:28:46] the Earth did quake and the Rocks rant
[1:28:49] and the graves were opened and many
[1:28:50] bodies of the Saints which slay slept
[1:28:52] arose and came out of the graves after
[1:28:56] his resurrection when he went into the
[1:28:58] holy city and appeared unto many so the
[1:29:01] Saints and that's injected because then
[1:29:02] it says in verse 54 then went the
[1:29:04] Centurion and they that were with him
[1:29:06] and it keeps talking about the
[1:29:07] resurrection so it's injected in there
[1:29:10] that there's to be a resurrection after
[1:29:12] because Jesus was the first fruits he
[1:29:14] had to be the first one to be
[1:29:15] resurrected right then the other Saints
[1:29:17] did right so God comes in in his end
[1:29:20] time he makes himself known he opens the
[1:29:24] word to his bride and there's a
[1:29:26] resurrection that's right there's a
[1:29:29] resurrection that is the next
[1:29:32] thing let's go to real fast let's go to
[1:29:34] St John 11 I'm sorry brother Joe that
[1:29:36] wasn't on there
[1:29:42] either St John
[1:29:45] 11 you can read the whole chapter and
[1:29:48] things when we get home I just want to
[1:29:49] point something beautifully out to you
[1:30:03] we find that
[1:30:04] Lazarus had
[1:30:07] died and Jesus again being subject to
[1:30:10] the word could not do anything until the
[1:30:12] father showed him so he purposely stayed
[1:30:15] away right and kept himself busy so that
[1:30:18] he would not go back there and heal
[1:30:20] Lazarus because that was not the
[1:30:21] father's work he was supposed to let
[1:30:24] Lazarus die so he could go and raise him
[1:30:26] up from the dead that's right so see
[1:30:28] Jesus himself said I do nothing but what
[1:30:30] the father shows me first see his
[1:30:33] subjection to the word Glory when he
[1:30:35] read the word and he read the Psalms of
[1:30:37] David and he's saying I shall not suffer
[1:30:40] my Holy One to see corruption in things
[1:30:42] he knew that was him right so he could
[1:30:44] stand in the temple and say destroy this
[1:30:47] temple in 3 days I'll raise it up right
[1:30:49] amen he was able to prophesy so
[1:30:52] in chapter 11 there you have the story
[1:30:55] where Jesus is now on his way
[1:30:57] back he's on his way back to their house
[1:31:00] of Mary and Martha but he doesn't go
[1:31:03] straight to Lazarus first right he goes
[1:31:07] to Mary and Martha first right he goes
[1:31:10] to Mary and Martha and he gathers the
[1:31:12] living one he gathers the living ones
[1:31:16] first by the
[1:31:17] shout gathers his bride together right
[1:31:22] look in St John
[1:31:25] 11 we'll start with uh verse 21 then
[1:31:29] said Martha unto Jesus Lord if thou has
[1:31:32] been here my brother had not died see
[1:31:33] Jesus came to them first and I know that
[1:31:35] even now whatsoever thou will ask of God
[1:31:37] God will give it thee Jesus saith unto
[1:31:40] her thy brother shall rise again Martha
[1:31:42] saith unto him I know that he shall rise
[1:31:44] again in the resurrection at the light
[1:31:46] at the last day one of my favorite
[1:31:48] scriptures here Jesus said unto her I am
[1:31:51] the resurrection and the life he that
[1:31:53] believeth in me though he were dead yet
[1:31:54] shall he live and whosoever liveth and
[1:31:56] believeth in me shall never die
[1:31:58] believest thou this she saith unto him
[1:32:01] yay Lord I believe that thou art the
[1:32:02] Christ the son of God which should come
[1:32:05] into the world right and when she had so
[1:32:07] said she went away and called Mary her
[1:32:10] sister secretly right saying the master
[1:32:14] is come and calleth for
[1:32:17] thee it's a secret the master is coming
[1:32:20] and he's calling for us exactly secretly
[1:32:24] amen then excuse me then he goes to
[1:32:27] lazarus's grave and raises up the dead
[1:32:30] right the dead in Christ do rise first
[1:32:33] before we're raptured that's right but
[1:32:35] he's got to send a message first to
[1:32:37] gather the elect come out of her my
[1:32:39] people come
[1:32:41] on and he comes in secret
[1:32:44] amen the master is come and calleth for
[1:32:47] thee right in absolute secrecy then they
[1:32:51] then he goes to the to the grave of
[1:32:52] Lazarus and raises him up see the order
[1:32:55] of scripture cannot be broken yes sir
[1:32:58] LED of the spirit the order of the
[1:33:00] scripture cannot be
[1:33:01] broken so in Matthew 27 you have the
[1:33:04] same thing you have the crucifixion of
[1:33:08] Jesus the word resurrects CU he's got to
[1:33:11] resurrect first right and then the
[1:33:12] Saints resurrect
[1:33:15] right just like over there in
[1:33:17] Revelations it says behold I come as a
[1:33:19] thief in the night it's just injected
[1:33:21] right in there it says a thief come
[1:33:24] on the prophet said the bride is going
[1:33:26] to be a little
[1:33:29] group and do you know that brother
[1:33:31] brandham said talked about Jesus how he
[1:33:33] would purposely say things to thin down
[1:33:36] the
[1:33:37] crowd now that can sound say well why
[1:33:39] would God do that because he knew who
[1:33:41] they were from the beginning he knew
[1:33:43] they were only after fishes and the
[1:33:44] loaves he knew that his disciples would
[1:33:46] not be shaken by what he said right
[1:33:49] amen you know and it's I my opinion I
[1:33:52] think it's easier now than ever to be to
[1:33:55] just fit in the message class but
[1:33:58] everything that can be shaken will be
[1:34:01] shaken right so everyone that that are
[1:34:04] just intellectual and can't cope with
[1:34:07] the word will leave because they were
[1:34:09] always after something else anyway but
[1:34:11] those that are truly Bride Can Never Be
[1:34:13] Shaken that's right they couldn't
[1:34:15] explain what Jesus said right at that
[1:34:19] time they didn't understand right
[1:34:27] so we see the picture exactly the
[1:34:29] same Rome was in control then and Rome
[1:34:33] is in control now just like they put
[1:34:36] Jesus in a Roman seal the Roman soldiers
[1:34:38] guarded it and things they tried to put
[1:34:40] a Roman seal on the word but he broke it
[1:34:42] and he resurrected amen he broke that
[1:34:45] Roman seal that's right so we find that
[1:34:48] after the
[1:34:49] resurrection after the Saints rose up
[1:34:51] from the dead they ascended with Jesus
[1:34:55] am is that right they ascended with
[1:34:57] Jesus well after that you've got people
[1:35:00] who tried to
[1:35:01] resist Rome oh yeah right sure and they
[1:35:06] were they were killed Titus came and
[1:35:08] destroyed them they called them zealots
[1:35:10] I believe right where they try to take
[1:35:12] matters in their own hand because
[1:35:13] they're hoping that Jesus would restore
[1:35:14] the Kingdom so they missed the mark
[1:35:16] right and the word they didn't listen
[1:35:19] and they didn't get out of Jerusalem
[1:35:20] when they seen that abom ation of
[1:35:21] desolation coming up right they didn't
[1:35:24] leave because they weren't true
[1:35:26] believers but they try to resist the
[1:35:28] mark of the beast and their own strength
[1:35:31] and the blood ran out the
[1:35:34] streets you see the exact
[1:35:36] picture Titus came and enforced Rome's
[1:35:40] mark on everything that was left and the
[1:35:43] blood ran up to the bridles of the
[1:35:45] horses it's already been foreshadowed so
[1:35:48] we see that okay Christ is resurrected
[1:35:51] from the the dead he's the first fruits
[1:35:53] what's next it's the Saints he's
[1:35:54] Gathering us we're Mary and Martha we've
[1:35:57] been gathered we're on our way to
[1:35:58] lazarus's grave come on and you look at
[1:36:01] St John chapter 12 and there's Jesus
[1:36:03] then goes to a
[1:36:05] supper right after he raises up Lazarus
[1:36:07] from the dead he goes to the supper and
[1:36:10] after the Saints are raised from the
[1:36:11] dead and we're caught up together with
[1:36:12] them to meet the Lord in the air we go
[1:36:14] to the marriage Feast we go to the
[1:36:18] supper the scriptures cannot be broken
[1:36:21] right
[1:36:23] am we see the exact same thing the exact
[1:36:26] same setting and the blessedness Saints
[1:36:28] of being able to recognize your day and
[1:36:31] your message can never be
[1:36:34] overemphasized because we've been graced
[1:36:38] by God's grace and his Mercy because
[1:36:40] we're no better than anyone else God
[1:36:42] forbid any of us ever have a spirit like
[1:36:44] that we're never better than anyone else
[1:36:47] it's by God's grace that we're
[1:36:48] called it's God's grace that we're
[1:36:50] called his Grace and his Mercy but to be
[1:36:52] able to see because no other age really
[1:36:55] understood what day and age they were
[1:36:57] living in until the last onea right
[1:36:59] that's right that's when the
[1:37:01] understanding was opened that's true up
[1:37:03] until then it was just in Shadow and
[1:37:04] type Luther didn't understand the
[1:37:06] message that that that the messenger or
[1:37:09] or that the age went from this date to
[1:37:11] this date and that God was not had two
[1:37:13] more ages to come because he had to keep
[1:37:15] them in constant suspense of the coming
[1:37:17] of the Lord had they known that it was
[1:37:20] still going to be three other ages and a
[1:37:22] Capstone and all these things they would
[1:37:24] have relaxed right but God told them
[1:37:27] behold I come right constantly keeping
[1:37:31] them on edge constantly keeping them in
[1:37:33] expectation of the Fulfillment of the
[1:37:35] word
[1:37:37] right and it always always takes Faith
[1:37:42] to believe the manifested
[1:37:44] word just like brother brandom you
[1:37:47] know he talks about how people would say
[1:37:51] oh if I would have lived in that day I
[1:37:54] would have been on Noah's Ark had I
[1:37:56] lived in Moses's day I would have
[1:37:58] believed he said you check your present
[1:38:00] condition right because remember Jesus
[1:38:02] is the message of the hour right of any
[1:38:06] day
[1:38:08] right of absolutely any
[1:38:11] day let me see I thought I had a brother
[1:38:14] rman
[1:38:16] leadership he just brings it home he
[1:38:18] talks about I thought I had that quote
[1:38:19] with me but in leadership there he talks
[1:38:22] about how it's one of the last messages
[1:38:25] he preached and he's talking about how
[1:38:27] only Jesus Christ is eternal life he's
[1:38:30] the only one that can give it and he
[1:38:32] says even this message that we're
[1:38:34] bringing
[1:38:35] now just learning it cannot give you
[1:38:38] eternal
[1:38:39] life you've got to go to Jesus to get
[1:38:41] eternal
[1:38:43] life so I think that a lot of times
[1:38:45] people may get the misconception that
[1:38:47] they've got to understand the word yeah
[1:38:52] you get to Jesus and he's got eternal
[1:38:53] life and he is the word then he'll lead
[1:38:55] you and guide you into all
[1:38:58] truth it's not about
[1:39:01] knowledge it's not about learning on
[1:39:05] it's about
[1:39:06] knowing the Lord Jesus
[1:39:09] christall brother Bram is preaching
[1:39:11] here
[1:39:13] closing in the sermon trumpet gives an
[1:39:16] uncertain
[1:39:17] sound he's talking about the Garden of
[1:39:20] Eden
[1:39:21] how God gave us gave Adam and Eve in the
[1:39:24] church everything that ever needed be
[1:39:26] that they would ever need to be
[1:39:28] fortified he said now the enemy spy
[1:39:30] Satan try to find out what he could do
[1:39:32] to break into that so he knowed he just
[1:39:35] could come out and bluffer so only thing
[1:39:37] he could do was to get her on reasoning
[1:39:40] right and that's what God uses today to
[1:39:42] fortify his church as his word and Satan
[1:39:44] comes around with reasoning
[1:39:47] power is that cloud really yeah Jes
[1:39:51] Jesus Christ descending yeah or is it I
[1:39:53] don't
[1:39:54] know reasoning yeah because brother says
[1:39:57] here Satan know that was the loophole
[1:40:00] that was the place that people would
[1:40:01] break the easiest was that reasoning
[1:40:04] because Satan had 6,000 years of of
[1:40:07] knowing man he knows mankind better than
[1:40:10] we know
[1:40:11] ourselves he knows the weakness and he
[1:40:14] knows exactly what to stay away from and
[1:40:16] everything he said you say now let me
[1:40:19] just reason with you now is it necessary
[1:40:22] if God said it was necessary it's
[1:40:24] necessary whether we have to cry and
[1:40:26] boohoo and do all this if God said the
[1:40:28] baptism of the Holy Ghost is necessary I
[1:40:30] don't care how heavy it is and how much
[1:40:33] of the world you have to give up he said
[1:40:35] you're going to have to use it one of
[1:40:38] these days to stay alive the only way of
[1:40:42] survival that's right he said the Holy
[1:40:45] Ghost will be the only way of
[1:40:49] survival because because it's Christ in
[1:40:52] you believing his own
[1:40:54] word and that is the only thing that
[1:40:56] won't be shaken because God will not
[1:40:58] deny his own
[1:41:00] word that's true it is impossible for
[1:41:02] God to deny his own
[1:41:04] word so how can he deny you if you are
[1:41:07] the word
[1:41:08] expressed exctly you cannot be denied
[1:41:11] because you are the word expressed if
[1:41:15] this spirit that raised Christ from the
[1:41:17] dead dwell in you then it'll also
[1:41:20] Quicken your body see the spirit that
[1:41:22] raised up Jesus from the dead has got to
[1:41:24] do the same thing in his
[1:41:25] body right whether it's physically with
[1:41:29] the saints that have gone on or whether
[1:41:31] it's spiritually in the bride to the
[1:41:33] resurrection it's got to be the same
[1:41:35] spirit because he is the same yesterday
[1:41:38] today and
[1:41:40] forever and no man can call Jesus the
[1:41:44] Christ but by the Holy Ghost amen all
[1:41:48] these people that are denying the
[1:41:49] message are not called calling Jesus the
[1:41:51] Christ by the Holy Ghost and it's
[1:41:53] interesting it's something because Satan
[1:41:54] has gotten so slick before you know
[1:41:56] throughout people would just leave the
[1:41:58] word and go in the world oh yeah but now
[1:42:00] they're leaving the
[1:42:02] word to be religious oh yeah you see how
[1:42:05] it's coming up it's deny the message
[1:42:08] deny what God's is doing to follow Jesus
[1:42:12] yeah but they don't have the right
[1:42:13] interpretation of what Jesus is because
[1:42:16] when Jesus was manifested in the flesh
[1:42:18] he was the word made manifest
[1:42:21] so the word made manifest in every age
[1:42:23] is Jesus that's right people thought
[1:42:26] they were worshiping God when Jesus was
[1:42:28] made manifest people thought they were
[1:42:30] worshiping
[1:42:32] God Moses's way but that was God's way
[1:42:35] that was Jesus you couldn't worship
[1:42:37] Jesus Moses's way when God had already
[1:42:40] manifested himself in flesh he was done
[1:42:42] with him scriptures he moved on right
[1:42:45] right so we've got to recognize it is
[1:42:48] important that we recognize exactly
[1:42:50] where we are are plac in the scripture
[1:42:52] because then we know we are in
[1:42:53] anticipated in
[1:42:55] anticipation we know that the body
[1:42:57] changes next we know so we should be an
[1:43:00] expectation that's right of God's word
[1:43:02] being manifested we should be an
[1:43:03] expectation of our loved ones right that
[1:43:08] is the will of God is to be an
[1:43:09] expectation of the word that he's
[1:43:10] getting ready to manifest we're not in
[1:43:12] expectation of God sending Malachi 4
[1:43:15] come on he did that and we we love him
[1:43:17] for that we're so grateful to you for
[1:43:20] we're so grateful to you Lord for that
[1:43:22] we're very grateful but be careful
[1:43:25] you've got to move along with the word
[1:43:27] as it comes move along with the light
[1:43:31] amen we're not trying to go and preach
[1:43:33] to the Jews to get 144,000 out because
[1:43:35] we know that God has two prophets to do
[1:43:37] that amen that is a blessing right to
[1:43:41] know exactly what portion that's right
[1:43:44] of the scripture is being that God is
[1:43:45] doing right
[1:43:47] now the present helping time of trouble
[1:43:51] right amen the manifestation of the word
[1:43:53] is Jesus Christ amen and it's the
[1:43:57] message that identifies him so perfectly
[1:43:59] right we see him doing the same Works
[1:44:03] Nicodemus and all all them people he
[1:44:05] said we know that thou are a teacher to
[1:44:07] come from God cuz who else could do
[1:44:08] these things they knew that God sent a
[1:44:13] prophet but for one reason or another
[1:44:15] they couldn't leave their denomination
[1:44:17] they couldn't they couldn't come on with
[1:44:19] it right right only the bride Will Truly
[1:44:21] Come on with it only the bride will
[1:44:24] really be there because in that day
[1:44:26] there's going to have to be oil in the
[1:44:28] lamp right there has to be oil in the
[1:44:30] lamp now but in that day oil you'll
[1:44:32] either have to have oil or you won't
[1:44:34] have oil right so you'll
[1:44:36] either go in with those that had oil or
[1:44:40] stay behind like them zealots who try to
[1:44:42] fight or resist the mark of the beast
[1:44:44] right because it all life on Earth will
[1:44:47] be wiped out the ones that aren't
[1:44:49] raptured they're all going to be killed
[1:44:51] that's right and then they're going to
[1:44:53] have to be raised at the
[1:44:57] judgment and answer for their works and
[1:44:59] what they done with the word as they
[1:45:01] know it because we're
[1:45:03] Justified and that's another wonderful
[1:45:05] thing that just so wonderful is the fact
[1:45:07] that God don't even remember your sins
[1:45:10] anymore because he promised that he
[1:45:13] would have a church without spot or
[1:45:15] wrinkle so sometimes we can be too hard
[1:45:18] on ourselves and Satan tries to bring
[1:45:19] something back to us that don't even
[1:45:21] remember Satan remembers and we remember
[1:45:24] because we're human right but God has
[1:45:27] the ability he's the only one that has
[1:45:29] the ability to
[1:45:31] forget and we are Justified amen through
[1:45:34] the blood of Jesus
[1:45:35] Christ amen the people on that day I
[1:45:38] mean I can't even begin to imagine
[1:45:39] trying to stand before God without the
[1:45:41] blood of Jesus that's right and
[1:45:43] everything be displayed on a screen like
[1:45:45] it will be with them right but for us as
[1:45:48] long as we repent and put it under the
[1:45:49] blood we have justification through
[1:45:51] Jesus Christ Our Lord amen God bless you
[1:45:54] Saints if we'll just stand to our
[1:45:57] feet thank you so much for the
[1:45:59] opportunity to share what I believe the
[1:46:00] Lord put upon my heart I just trust that
[1:46:03] God will just help us to meditate in
[1:46:05] these things and I was talking to
[1:46:07] brother Bob you know it's it's a
[1:46:08] wonderful thing to be able to retain the
[1:46:12] word that's heard right and I'm not
[1:46:14] saying that cuz I'm preaching I'm saying
[1:46:16] that that's my desire when I hear a
[1:46:18] brother preach when I hear a tape of the
[1:46:20] prop Propet is to be able to retain
[1:46:22] what's spoken and then God give me the
[1:46:25] wisdom to apply it to my
[1:46:28] life amen amen well I'm going we'll just
[1:46:32] go to the Lord in prayer and then I'm
[1:46:33] going turn the service back to brother
