[0:01] and just being in prayer for brother Bob
[0:02] and family. I believe they went to see
[0:04] the grandbaby. I'm pretty sure that's
[0:05] where they're
[0:08] at. Let's see
[0:12] here. Okay, we're going to be teaching a
[0:14] lesson on divine healing. I still got a
[0:17] lot to teach on my love lesson series.
[0:19] I've been on that for some time and I've
[0:20] got one prepared, but uh this came on my
[0:23] heart pretty heavy a while back and I
[0:25] started meditating on uh divine healing.
[0:27] So I want to give a little lesson on
[0:28] that just kind of sidestep for a minute
[0:31] and maybe next time we'll continue our
[0:32] uh love lesson series. So uh let's go
[0:35] Lord in prayer. Heaven father we thank
[0:37] you for let to be your Lord today and
[0:38] thank you Lord for being here with us in
[0:40] the service and the Sunday schools uh
[0:42] here and also downstairs and all the
[0:44] other ministers and right around the
[0:45] world. Uh let everything be done a way
[0:47] be pleasing to you. I pray help brother
[0:48] Chris bring the message for us here this
[0:50] morning and uh just let this lesson be a
[0:53] blessing to the people here. I pray and
[0:54] we love you and thank you for all your
[0:56] blessings. to be with brother Bob and
[0:57] family traveling and all those who are
[0:59] still um traveling different places.
[1:01] Lord and all who may still be on the way
[1:02] here. We love you and thank you in Jesus
[1:04] name. Amen.
[1:09] So I plan to address a couple different
[1:11] things here. Why do symptoms linger even
[1:15] after we accept our healing and confess
[1:17] it? That's one thing I kind of want to
[1:18] address about divine healing. And then
[1:22] keep a positive confession. I really
[1:23] want to put emphasis on that. the
[1:25] importance of really keeping a positive
[1:27] confession because I'm an adamant
[1:30] believer, maybe a little bit on the
[1:32] extreme side. I might even air on the
[1:34] side of caution, we'll say, but
[1:36] confessing no matter what that you're
[1:39] healed and not confessing your symptoms
[1:41] no matter what. Maybe with the exception
[1:44] of going to the doctor, you know, they
[1:45] they're the one that diagnosed you. They
[1:47] know your situation. They might ask
[1:49] specific questions and you just answer
[1:51] their questions. But to say, you know,
[1:53] to family and friends, sometimes people
[1:55] are not being nosy. Maybe they just
[1:57] really care about you and they want to
[1:59] ask you, "What about your XYZ disease?"
[2:02] You know, whatever it is, how you doing?
[2:04] And um I'm a 20-year veteran, I guess
[2:06] you could say, of divine healing. It's
[2:08] been since 2005. I'll give my testimony
[2:11] here in a moment, but sometimes over the
[2:13] years, people in my family have known
[2:15] the diagnosis that I was given
[2:17] originally, and they still want to ask
[2:18] me. and I can be right in the middle of
[2:20] symptoms and I'll still tell them I'm
[2:22] doing fine. All is well. Really keep a
[2:24] positive confession. They're not trying
[2:25] to stumble you, but nonetheless, you can
[2:28] let down your confession. So, these are
[2:30] my definitions. I want to make a
[2:31] distinction about miracle healing versus
[2:34] divine healing. Just for the purpose of
[2:35] this lesson so we're on the same page
[2:37] here. So, miracle healing something
[2:39] instant. It's a complete healing of a
[2:41] sickness or a condition. That'd be
[2:43] something like in a prayer line where a
[2:44] cancer falls off or blinded eyes are
[2:46] open and it happens right there on the
[2:48] spot. Okay. But divine healing is a
[2:50] process. It takes place over a period of
[2:53] time believing God and confessing
[2:54] healing before symptoms subside. And
[2:57] that can be weeks, months or years. You
[3:00] just keep going no matter what. God is
[3:02] sovereign. He decides that if you get it
[3:04] a miracle healing or a divine healing um
[3:07] he knows best. But divine healing is
[3:09] very synonymous with salvation itself.
[3:11] They both start with you
[3:14] believing. Believe in your heart.
[3:15] Confess with your mouth. Romans 10,
[3:17] right? That applies to salvation as well
[3:19] as healing. Okay? It's a twofold
[3:21] atonement. And in that word there, thou
[3:24] shalt be saved in Romans 10:10, I think.
[3:26] And actually, if you look it up in the
[3:27] Greek, it actually means saved and
[3:29] healed. So, we're talking about both
[3:31] those things. So, you start believing,
[3:33] start confessing, and just keep on going
[3:35] through the whole journey. You never
[3:36] stop. Never let down in your confession.
[3:39] So, my testimony is going to be
[3:40] interwoven throughout this lesson. I'll
[3:42] just give a brief overview. In 2005, I
[3:44] was diagnosed with something. Not going
[3:46] to say, I don't care to. You fill in the
[3:48] blank for whatever your diagnosis is.
[3:50] That's me and my sister there. I just
[3:52] found a quick picture. That's one that
[3:53] came up from that time period. That was
[3:55] about 2005. I was diagnosed with
[3:57] something and I came up to the altar for
[3:59] prayer. I had been in the message three
[4:01] years. So, I had a good foundation to
[4:03] know at least what brother Brandham and
[4:05] all of our ministers and brother Dell
[4:07] were teaching about the approach to
[4:09] divine healing. I knew you could say
[4:11] from a
[4:12] conceptual basis, maybe not by
[4:14] revelation, but I understood
[4:15] conceptually at least the idea to
[4:17] approach God for divine healing is come
[4:20] to the altar if you need to, you know,
[4:22] one time and that's it. One time only.
[4:24] You don't make repeat trips to the
[4:25] altar. You get weaker in your faith when
[4:26] you do that. So, over 20 years, I've
[4:29] only come up here one time for this. As
[4:30] far as I remember, it was 2005. And
[4:32] brother Dale, I believe, was the one
[4:34] that prayed for me. I took that box of
[4:36] rattlesnakes and I set it down here at
[4:38] the altar and it's still here. It has
[4:41] not moved. Okay. Now, symptoms persisted
[4:45] after that. I see taste, feel, smell
[4:47] here tells me the symptoms are still
[4:49] here for a whole six months. So, 2006
[4:53] completely left me for many years. 2012
[4:55] it showed up again. I thought, what in
[4:57] the world? Uh, Lord, I let down on my
[4:59] faith. Where'd I mess up? And this is my
[5:01] next lesson that I had to learn on
[5:03] divine healing is that even the symptoms
[5:05] come back, you still keep confessing it.
[5:07] Okay? No matter what, no matter how many
[5:09] times, and you don't have to come back
[5:10] to the altar for prayer, just keep on
[5:12] confessing it. That prayer did not
[5:14] expire over all these years. And even
[5:16] after brother Dale going to be with the
[5:17] Lord, that prayer still stands. It did
[5:20] not expire. Okay? So, I don't come back
[5:22] to the altar for it. So, um, I had that
[5:25] real kind of real good foundation that I
[5:27] knew we don't make repeat trips to the
[5:29] altar. We you confess it and pray and
[5:32] believe and then no negative confession.
[5:33] How many times brother Dale always tell
[5:35] us, don't stand out there in the parking
[5:36] lot and say, "Well, doctor said this and
[5:38] my medicine's not doing good, blah blah
[5:40] blah blah blah." No, just tell everybody
[5:42] I'm doing well. Thank the Lord for
[5:43] healing me. Praise the Lord for healing
[5:45] me. This is my best description of
[5:47] divine healing. The process of divine
[5:49] healing is that you keep confessing your
[5:51] healing no matter what. The worst the
[5:53] devil can do to you is put is the best
[5:55] thing that can really happen to you. Put
[5:57] you in the presence of God. So it pays
[5:59] to just be resolved that I'm going to
[6:02] confess and believe I'm my healing no
[6:04] matter what. And then if God wills that
[6:06] I pass from this life and go to be with
[6:09] him, I'll never suffer pain and sickness
[6:11] again. So I have nothing to lose. If
[6:13] you're in Christ, you really don't have
[6:14] anything to lose. Might as well just
[6:16] believe God. And if he delivers you,
[6:18] fine. And if and if you know you go by
[6:20] the way of the grave, you know, you're
[6:21] not going to have the cancer again.
[6:22] You're not going to have any of that
[6:23] sickness again, whatever it was. So just
[6:26] keep believing
[6:27] God. Um Jesus Christ same yesterday,
[6:30] today, and forever. Brother Bennis said,
[6:31] "Then which is the healer? The medicine
[6:33] or the life?" Life is the healer. Then
[6:36] God is life. Life does the healing.
[6:39] Medicine doesn't build tissue. Medicine
[6:41] doesn't develop cells. Medicine only
[6:43] keeps clean while God develops the
[6:44] cells. Now, Brother Brandon believed in
[6:46] medicine and doctors and so forth. God
[6:48] heals through medicine and doctors. But
[6:51] Brandon was talking about I think was uh
[6:53] there that people were putting maybe too
[6:55] much emphasis on medicine. God is the
[6:57] healer. He's the only healer period. We
[6:59] go to God for healing. But we do take
[7:01] the the medicine and go to the doctors
[7:03] if you know if they can help. Um but the
[7:06] point is trust God for the healing.
[7:08] Okay? Life is the healer. Two, think
[7:11] about the fact of human anatomy. God
[7:13] made a engineering marvel when he made
[7:16] this body. It is it is incredible. It's
[7:18] self-healing of so many things. So don't
[7:21] underestimate the power of your own body
[7:22] to heal itself of so many things. The
[7:24] white blood cells that brother way was
[7:26] talking about the other day, you know,
[7:27] they go into action when you got an
[7:29] infection, a virus or a cut, puncture
[7:31] wound or whatever, immediately these
[7:33] things, these uh mechanisms in your body
[7:35] go into action to start the healing
[7:37] process. But divine healing is when you
[7:41] maybe you have something that your body
[7:43] is working against itself or something
[7:45] it can't heal itself of. But suffice it
[7:48] to say, I pray for every sickness that
[7:50] comes in our house. Every little
[7:52] infection, cough, cold, flu, whatever, I
[7:54] pray and I lay hands on. And Gabby and
[7:56] the girls all pray together and we
[7:58] believe in prayer. Even if it's
[7:59] something, you know, you're going to get
[8:00] over anyway, we still pray. But for
[8:03] divine healing, sometimes you need that
[8:05] because your body can't heal itself of
[8:07] certain things. But it's actually an
[8:09] incredible thing that God gave us this
[8:10] body. Even in our fallen condition,
[8:12] it'll heal itself. If you just kind of
[8:13] get out of the way, you know, drink
[8:15] sometimes doctor tell you just drink
[8:17] fluids and and rest. You know, let your
[8:19] body do its
[8:20] thing. So, um, this is brother Bob.
[8:23] Brother Bob's going to minister for us
[8:25] from 100 miles away from where he's at
[8:27] today. He's going to minister for us for
[8:28] a few slides. This is from 2023
[8:31] September uh on a message called We Have
[8:34] a Lamb. Brother Bob, I think this
[8:36] afternoon maybe if that confuses you a
[8:39] little bit, we take faith and swap it
[8:41] for revelation. We can take revelation,
[8:44] swap it for faith. Faith is a
[8:46] revelation. Revelation is faith. And
[8:48] those two things are really the same
[8:50] thing. So if you've got faith is because
[8:53] God has revealed something to you. And
[8:55] what did he reveal to you? He revealed
[8:58] himself to you. When you need healing,
[9:00] he reveals that he is a healer and that
[9:03] you've got the thing that you were
[9:05] hoping for and now you've got it because
[9:07] it's revealed to you and that becomes a
[9:09] substance. I love the way ministers can
[9:12] break these things down where we can
[9:14] understand. It's a substance because
[9:16] it's re it's a revelation of Jesus
[9:18] Christ personally to you. You see him
[9:20] when you read the Bible and it's
[9:22] transformed beyond something that's just
[9:24] your head something knowledge and now
[9:26] it's in your heart and you know it
[9:29] because he's shown it to you. That's
[9:31] what I'm talking about. When I'm
[9:32] preaching about the seven seals when God
[9:34] reveals it to you, you've got
[9:35] it. If it's something that passes beyond
[9:38] all hopes, you say, "Brother Bob, what's
[9:40] the difference between hope and faith?"
[9:41] Faith is not something you're just
[9:43] looking for. Faith is when God reveals
[9:45] it to you. you've got the thing you were
[9:47] hoping for because God has revealed it
[9:49] to you. It was many years into my
[9:51] journey where I actually believe divine
[9:52] healing was revealed to me. It was after
[9:54] that second or maybe even third time of
[9:56] symptoms showing up again. Many, many
[9:58] years, like 10 years into this 20-year
[10:00] journey. And that's when actually I was
[10:02] standing in the back of U-Haul truck
[10:03] listening to brother Bam tell about John
[10:05] Ryan. And I'm Ryan John if you didn't
[10:08] know that. I don't think those things
[10:10] are an accident. His testimony always
[10:11] stood out to me because I'm Ryan John
[10:13] and growing up they called me RJ and
[10:14] Ryan John. Uh Jonathan is my middle
[10:17] name. So Lion John Ryan, he kept coming
[10:20] back to the altar or he came back up the
[10:22] second time, you know, cuz his eyes
[10:23] didn't open right away. He didn't
[10:25] understand. He thought his eyes were
[10:26] supposed to open right away, but God was
[10:28] going to heal him through divine
[10:29] healing, but it had to happen. I think
[10:31] brother Ben on that one said, "Thus
[10:32] sayeth the Lord." So it couldn't fail.
[10:34] But anyway, we'll get into that
[10:35] testimony near the end, I hope. But his
[10:37] eyes did come open as y'all know from
[10:40] expectation. Brother Benham said,
[10:42] "Notice how marvelous the symptoms just
[10:44] like in the morning some of you women
[10:45] here. What if the postal man in the
[10:47] morning or you say the railroad express
[10:48] agent would come up to your house and
[10:50] say, "Miss John
[10:51] Doe, yes, I have something here was sent
[10:54] to you." And you look at it and you say,
[10:56] "Well, what is that?" And you look into
[10:57] it. It's a big box and there's a big box
[10:59] of rattlesnakes. Why? You say, "I just I
[11:01] don't want those things, but they're
[11:03] yours. Somebody sent them to you." Why?
[11:06] You say, "I don't want them." But now,
[11:08] Miss John, Miss Do, here's your name on
[11:11] it. Somebody sent them to you. They're
[11:13] yours. And he will do everything he can
[11:15] to make you take them. Now, in one
[11:16] sense, they're yours. Another sense,
[11:17] they're not. They're not yours till you
[11:19] sign for them. But if you refuse to sign
[11:21] for them, he has to take them back to
[11:23] the express agent. He has to send them
[11:25] back to the one that sent them. Don't
[11:27] use sign for nothing. The devil brought
[11:30] refused to have it. That was me in 2005
[11:34] coming up here to the altar putting the
[11:35] rattlesnakes down, never confessing it.
[11:38] Okay? And many of you have done that. I
[11:40] know y'all know, brother Boyd and many
[11:42] other examples of here of people who
[11:43] don't talk about their symptoms. Don't
[11:45] sit outside and complain and you know,
[11:47] don't have it. No sir, the devil put
[11:50] that affliction, the devil put that
[11:51] disease there. Just refuse to see it.
[11:54] Just say, "No, sir. I won't sign. I
[11:56] won't testify for nothing you said. I
[11:58] will testify by his stripes. I'm hell,
[12:00] brother." And he'll take it back. So,
[12:02] here's a box of rattlesnakes. That was
[12:03] what was given to me in 2005. The old
[12:05] nasty box of rattlesnakes. I know some
[12:06] people like snakes. They're kind of
[12:07] creepy. Anyway, I don't like snakes.
[12:09] Don't care to be around them. I don't
[12:10] like a pet that can kill me. We got cats
[12:12] and dogs. They're nice. Don't sign for
[12:15] it. It's not yours. Period. Now, how do
[12:18] you not sign for the box of
[12:20] rattlesnakes? Bring it to the altar if
[12:22] you need to. Maybe your faith is enough
[12:23] that you don't need to. I just wanted to
[12:25] just right off the bat just bring it to
[12:26] the altar and lay it down. And I'm glad
[12:28] I did. I can always look back to that
[12:29] and say, "That's where I left it, Satan.
[12:31] That's right. But if you don't, you
[12:32] don't have to come to the altar. I'm
[12:34] just saying. Don't sign for it. Just
[12:35] refuse to have it. Okay. Now, perfect
[12:39] faith. They are kin folks. They love.
[12:41] Love produces faith. And when Satan
[12:43] tempts us, we are to resist him in a
[12:45] perfect faith. The perfect word like
[12:47] Jesus did. The the word of God is
[12:48] perfect. We're to have perfect faith in
[12:51] this perfect word of God and resist
[12:53] Satan. That's not signing for it. That's
[12:56] refusing to have it.
[12:58] Okay. So now on this box there would be
[13:01] certain labels and on the box that was
[13:04] given to me in 2005 there was this
[13:06] label. The doctor said Ryan the disease
[13:09] you have is
[13:11] incurable. All we can do is give you
[13:14] different medicines to try to alleviate
[13:15] the symptoms. That was actually 10 years
[13:18] in 2015 and that was my last doctor
[13:21] visit because she was wrong on so many
[13:23] levels. I said I was thinking I didn't
[13:25] slap her in the face and kick her in the
[13:27] teeth or anything. I wasn't mean I
[13:28] didn't put her head locked or anything.
[13:29] I just said I just smiled and nodded and
[13:32] didn't go back. That was as simple as
[13:33] that. But inside I was thinking well
[13:35] okay first of all it's not my disease.
[13:37] So she was wrong to say that it's the
[13:39] disease you have. And then to say it's
[13:41] incurable. I want to hit that one in the
[13:43] head here in a second. Um and then the
[13:46] third thing is and she said uh all we
[13:48] can do is try to alleviate the symptoms.
[13:49] I said well we're not doing a very good
[13:50] job with that so far. For the last few
[13:53] years I've been going up until 2015. All
[13:56] the medicines they gave me didn't work.
[13:57] They had higher levels of medicine that
[13:59] I didn't want to try. My sister lives
[14:01] across railroad tracks. She has no
[14:04] colon. Um she struggled with this
[14:06] disease, not the one that I was
[14:07] diagnosed with, but something similar to
[14:09] it for all of her life basically. And
[14:11] finally in the end she's the doctor said
[14:14] why don't we try taking your colon? I
[14:15] was sitting there after I heard that
[14:17] news. I was like I didn't know I could
[14:18] live without that. I thought I needed my
[14:20] brain, my colon and my my heart and my
[14:22] lungs. I was thinking I need to keep all
[14:23] those. So personally, I want to keep all
[14:25] those. I'm an organ donor, so if
[14:27] something happened to me, they can have
[14:28] all my organs. But for me personally, I
[14:30] don't want to give up my organs. And I
[14:33] don't want to take these extreme levels
[14:35] of medication that could put me in the
[14:37] hospital cuz she wound up taking a very
[14:40] uh very hardcore medicine of some kind
[14:42] that wound up um putting her in the
[14:44] hospital. And we thought we were going
[14:46] to lose her back in 2005, actually. So,
[14:49] you know, you got to use wisdom about,
[14:51] you know, taking what the doctor gives,
[14:52] okay? just use a lot of prayer and
[14:54] wisdom about that. But Psalm 103, bless
[14:58] the Lord, all my soul, and forget not
[14:59] all his benefits, who forgiveth all
[15:01] thine iniquities, who heal all thy
[15:03] diseases. So I read in the scripture
[15:06] that there is no incurable disease. And
[15:08] if the doctor tells you that, you don't
[15:10] have to punch them in the mouth or to
[15:12] kick them in the teeth. You just say,
[15:13] "Okay, whatever." You know, I believe
[15:16] the Bible. I I know another guy. All
[15:18] right? And uh so this may be the last
[15:20] time we may part ways here because I
[15:21] know another guy. Okay. Um, so all thy
[15:25] diseases, he can cure all of them. There
[15:27] is no incurable disease. Okay. There are
[15:30] there's an exception to that. I'll get
[15:31] to that here in a minute. Um, actually
[15:33] it's on these couple of slides. These
[15:35] are the ones that I find in the Bible
[15:36] where you find the word incurable. And I
[15:39] put there in green. I know these are
[15:40] small. I don't I don't intend to read
[15:42] all these. I'm just letting you know a
[15:43] few instances where you find incurable.
[15:45] One of them is 2 Chronicles 21. There
[15:47] you look at there in green. That's why
[15:49] it was put on Jehoram, king of Israel.
[15:51] He was
[15:52] disobedient. Uh Job is a special case
[15:55] because he was put uh sicknesses were
[15:57] put on him because of trials. He was
[15:59] being tried for the word of God's sake,
[16:01] you know, and we know the story of Job.
[16:03] He said, "Should I lie against my right?
[16:05] My wound is incurable without
[16:06] transgression." He knew he was right
[16:08] spiritually. He knew he was in the right
[16:09] place with God. It wasn't anything he
[16:11] done wrong. God was letting to be
[16:12] tempted, you know, and and tried and and
[16:14] and showing the devil that he will not
[16:16] deny him and not curse him. So he he
[16:19] knew the faith of Job and how strong it
[16:20] was that it would stand. So sometimes
[16:22] maybe God lets things come on you and
[16:24] linger um you know to try you and and to
[16:26] test your faith and and make you
[16:28] stronger you know because the trying
[16:30] your faith you know builds patience and
[16:32] so forth but the other cases many times
[16:34] in the Bible you see incurable it's
[16:36] children of Israel forgot the god of
[16:38] their salvation. It was a rebuke to uh
[16:40] backslid and Judah it was rebuke uh to
[16:44] against the rebellious Israel and to
[16:46] Nineveh even. So in many cases, maybe
[16:48] eight or nine of them that I found where
[16:50] you find the word incurable. So I would
[16:52] say to that, make sure you're right with
[16:54] God. If something comes on you and it
[16:55] seems to linger, just say, "Lord, is
[16:57] there something I need to make right? Am
[16:58] I am I messing up somewhere? Am I coming
[17:00] short somewhere in my repentance? Is
[17:01] there something I didn't think about?"
[17:03] But once you know that you're right and
[17:04] you're walking in God in sanctification
[17:06] and continue on with with your journey
[17:07] with the Lord, then just believe God and
[17:10] wait for it to manifest and just keep
[17:12] confessing your healing. So there is no
[17:15] incurable disease. Just remember that
[17:17] hereditary on the box of rattlesnakes
[17:20] given to me said hereditary on it. Satan
[17:22] said, "Look here." He says, I says,
[17:24] "Dell Bonnet, that's your grandpa." And
[17:26] I said, "Yeah, Satan, I know he I know
[17:28] he has it. He's had it most his life."
[17:30] And then he said, "Uh, look at there.
[17:32] Broo Bonnet, that's your sister. She's
[17:34] got it." I said, "Yeah, I know Brooke
[17:35] has struggled with it all her life, but
[17:38] it's not mine."
[17:40] I don't know where we're not
[17:41] understanding each other here, saying
[17:42] it's not mine. I set it down there at
[17:44] the altar. I don't care if it's
[17:45] heritary. I don't care if I inherit it
[17:46] through my blood. It's not mine. So, you
[17:49] just stand there and say, "I don't care
[17:50] who all has it. It's not mine." Period.
[17:52] Chronic. Oh, you're you're going to have
[17:54] this the rest of your life. They said at
[17:56] the start of this when I was diagnosed,
[17:57] they said, now this is something you'll
[17:59] die with, but not that of. So, good
[18:01] news. It's it's not going to kill you. I
[18:02] was like, uh, I'm not going to have my
[18:05] whole life. I'm sorry either. Okay.
[18:07] Chronic. That's that's a lie, too. So,
[18:10] but he that shall endure to the end, the
[18:13] same shall be saved. And again, that's
[18:15] Matthew 24. Again, save there means uh
[18:18] in salvation, but also diseased to make
[18:20] well or heal or restore to health.
[18:24] Romans 10:9, I confess uh uh quoted this
[18:27] one a while ago. If thou confess with
[18:28] thy mouth the Lord Jesus, thou shalt
[18:30] believe in the heart that God hath
[18:32] raised him from the dead, thou shalt be
[18:34] saved. For with the heart man believeth
[18:35] into the righteousness, and with the
[18:36] mouth confession made to salvation.
[18:38] Again, there as I said, saved means
[18:41] saved and healed. This is talking about
[18:43] both. So keep that same process for both
[18:46] healing and for salvation. Believe in
[18:48] your heart, confess with your mouth.
[18:51] Brother Bannon says they are Christians.
[18:52] As long as you believe that, all right,
[18:54] but the minute that you begin to think
[18:56] that you're not, that's the time you
[18:58] start sinking right there. That's the
[18:59] time your testimony is negative. Divine
[19:02] healing lasts as long as your faith
[19:04] lasts with it. your salvation the same
[19:07] because everything God of God is by
[19:09] faith and nothing of God's can be proven
[19:13] by
[19:15] natural perfect faith uh brother Benham
[19:17] says love and faith has to go together
[19:19] they're kin folks they they love love
[19:22] produces faith that's where I let down
[19:23] on my testimony when Iva was dying when
[19:25] she was born she was 3 days old and she
[19:28] was fixing to pass away and uh my rebuke
[19:31] that God gave me was through 1 John 4 he
[19:34] who fearth is not made perfect in love
[19:35] instead of looking at God's promise and
[19:38] and trusting him that everything is well
[19:40] with the baby even if she dies. His
[19:42] point was to me even if your baby dies
[19:44] just believe me and confess no matter
[19:47] what because fear has torment you know
[19:51] he who fear is not made perfect in love.
[19:53] I realized then that my love with God
[19:55] wasn't what it should be at that time
[19:57] because if I loved God like I should I
[19:59] would just trust him have confidence
[20:00] he's in control. I was in his hands and
[20:03] if he takes her, it's for a purpose. He
[20:06] knows best. When Satan tempts us, we are
[20:09] to resist him in a perfect faith and
[20:11] perfect word. We're already quoted that
[20:13] one. Sorry about that. As I was with
[20:15] Moses, I want to ask you this question.
[20:18] Now, if you believe it, it's an
[20:19] impossibility impossibility for you not
[20:22] to be
[20:23] healed. It's totally impossible for you
[20:26] not to be healed if you believe it.
[20:30] That's really strong. That's that's a
[20:31] quote that if you don't have anything
[20:33] else, you can stand on that quote. I
[20:34] mean, for crying out loud, that's that's
[20:36] as strong as it gets. Take the foxes,
[20:39] little foxes that spoil the vine, for
[20:40] our vines have tender grapes, says Song
[20:41] of Solomon 2. Don't let down your
[20:43] confession. You will spoil the vine of
[20:45] divine healing. As I said a while ago,
[20:47] well-meaning family members will ask
[20:49] about your diagnosis. Just tell them all
[20:51] is well. It's what brother Bham did uh
[20:53] to his own parents, I think, when he had
[20:55] that stomach problem. Um, salvation
[20:57] lasts as long as faith last and divine
[20:59] healing lasts as long as faith
[21:01] lasts. Don't let down on your testimony.
[21:05] Um, you don't go by your feelings. I was
[21:08] never saved by my feelings. I wasn't
[21:10] saved because I felt good. I'm saved
[21:11] because I met God's promise. That's it.
[21:14] Devil can beat you around, stamp on
[21:16] feelings, things, thus say the Lord and
[21:17] condemn it. I've done what Jesus said.
[21:20] I'm saved tonight because I met God's
[21:22] requirement. I'm healed tonight. Um, he
[21:24] now here's brother Bannon's testimony.
[21:26] Uh, I think this is the start of it. I
[21:28] thought there was a another picture in
[21:30] there leading up to it. I'm healthy and
[21:32] strong tonight because I believe God
[21:34] said so. Look at his word. It's all your
[21:36] faith in God. The only thing that'll
[21:38] stagger that's only thing that ever heal
[21:40] a sick person is their personal faith in
[21:42] God. Refuse to see symptoms or anything
[21:44] else. Walk by faith. Just the just shall
[21:47] live by it. Let no corrupt communication
[21:49] come out of your mouth. I want you to
[21:51] think about the phrase refrain and
[21:53] maintain. Refrain from a negative
[21:54] confession at all times. Maintain a
[21:56] positive confession at all times. Okay?
[21:59] Those two go hand in hand. Don't stand
[22:01] here in church on Sunday and confess
[22:03] you're healed. Then Monday a co-orker is
[22:04] asking you how you doing. Well, you
[22:06] know, I just I'm not sure about the
[22:08] doctor. He said, you know, just go on
[22:10] confess you're healed anyway. Say, all
[22:11] is well. You're not lying. You're just
[22:14] looking at the promise of God and
[22:16] they're meaning well, but you just smile
[22:18] and say, I'm good. I'm doing good. How
[22:19] you doing? Doing great. Um, corrupt
[22:23] communication. I'm not going to go into
[22:24] that, but that's just more elaboration
[22:26] on that scripture testimony. Brother
[22:27] Brandham, now here's our prophet's own
[22:29] testimony. As some of you know, he had a
[22:31] stomach problem. You remember when I had
[22:32] a stomach trouble regurgitation and what
[22:34] may your brothers told me that not even
[22:36] one earthly chance, not one chance in 10
[22:39] million to live and my stomach was
[22:40] nothing but just one raw bloody ulcer.
[22:44] Wow. And then here's his confession. He
[22:47] got tired of living on a uh liquid diet,
[22:50] basically barley, water, I think, and
[22:51] something else. And and he was he was
[22:53] tired of it. He said, "Well, if I'm
[22:54] going if eating food kills me, I'm just
[22:55] going to eat food and die, you know? I'm
[22:57] to that point. I'm just tired of living
[22:58] like this." So, he ate some against the
[23:01] doctor's word. The doctor said, "If one
[23:03] bite of food, if you eat one bite of
[23:04] food, it'll kill you." So, he said it
[23:06] tasted good. And when I swallowed it, as
[23:08] soon as I swallowed it, it was just like
[23:09] a lump of fire heating my stomach. And
[23:12] here it come back up. I held my hand
[23:13] over my mouth. I said, "Uh-oh, you're
[23:15] going to stay right. You're going to
[23:17] stay right there." I swallowed it back
[23:19] and come up again. I swallowed it back.
[23:21] Come up again. I swallowed it back. I
[23:23] said, "Now you stay there, cuz here's
[23:25] another one coming." It just kept eating
[23:27] food, swallowing it down. It hurt. It
[23:29] was coming back up. It was an awful
[23:30] experience. I'm going to tell you, I
[23:31] I've sat in front of the in some of the
[23:33] most horrible symptoms over the last 20
[23:36] years. at times by by the way for the
[23:38] record in 20 years 90 or 90% of the time
[23:41] or better not experienced any symptoms
[23:43] at all but the few times it's come back
[23:45] up I've sat in some horrible symptoms
[23:48] not told anybody here and uh and just
[23:51] sat there and said God thank you for
[23:53] healing me and it feels kind of weird to
[23:55] say that when you're miserable
[23:57] absolutely miserable and then sitting
[23:59] there saying thank you Lord for healing
[24:00] me and then the devil lingers right
[24:02] there for weeks months and maybe even a
[24:04] year or more you know and pop This is
[24:06] his dad. I guess he's talking about how
[24:08] you feeling. I said, "Wonderful." Kept
[24:09] on chewing. He wasn't lying. He was just
[24:11] confessing the promise of God. Swallow
[24:13] it again. Here it come. I hold my hand
[24:15] over said, "Excuse me." I was belching.
[24:17] It was ugly. And them beans coming up. I
[24:19] just kept on eating like that. And I
[24:21] left the table. Mom called the doctor.
[24:23] She said, "Why? He ate beans and
[24:25] cornbread. He's he's been reading the
[24:26] Bible that he said that God healed him."
[24:29] The doctor didn't like that at all. So
[24:30] he said, "Well, I'll be in here pumping
[24:32] his stomach, you know." Anyway, but he
[24:34] was healed. Uh testimony of Iva. Just
[24:37] one little brief comment about that in
[24:41] 2014 when she was dying. The doctor said
[24:43] she was dying. The doctor northeast
[24:45] Georgia said, "Your your baby's vital
[24:47] organs are fixing to start shutting
[24:48] down. We need to send her to Egleston."
[24:50] And on the way down, she almost died
[24:52] twice. The medical personnel working on
[24:54] her, the paramedic said, "I almost lost
[24:56] your baby two times on the way down
[24:57] here. They passed us with lights and
[24:59] sirens in the ambulance. We we were
[25:00] ahead of the ambulance and they passed
[25:02] us an emergency style, you know. And
[25:04] then the doctor down there, first thing
[25:06] she said to us, "Hi, I'm Heidi Carpin.
[25:07] Your baby's dying." And I stood up here
[25:10] a few hours later right in that spot and
[25:12] told y'all I was playing the drums, you
[25:14] know. And I I stood up and I testified
[25:15] and I said, "I was doing fine. Just keep
[25:18] praying for her." Did I tell anybody she
[25:20] was dying? Nobody here knew it. And
[25:23] weeks later, we still didn't have her
[25:24] baby. They're like, "You had somebody
[25:25] said to us, you had a baby, right?" Cuz
[25:27] she was still in the hospital. You know,
[25:29] it took her a long time to come out of
[25:30] that, but we wouldn't confess it. We
[25:32] didn't even use the D word between me
[25:33] and Gabby. We wouldn't say she's dying.
[25:35] We wouldn't confess that. We were told
[25:37] three times and we said,
[25:40] "No, just pray for her." And that's all
[25:42] we said. Almost 11 years later now,
[25:44] she's downstairs in Sunday school.
[25:47] Perfect faith. No matter what the thing
[25:49] looks like, no matter what anybody else
[25:50] says, you know what's happened. You know
[25:53] that it's finished. Love and faith has
[25:55] to go together. See, that was my main uh
[25:57] lesson to learn in that trial was trust
[25:59] and love God no matter what. If you
[26:01] really love him like you should. You'll
[26:02] trust him that all circumstances are in
[26:04] his hand. Everything that happens to you
[26:06] is in his hands. He's completely in
[26:08] control. If something bad happens, it's
[26:10] for your good. Trust him anyway. If you
[26:13] musicians, y'all can go and make your
[26:14] way up, please. And then, Brother Bam's
[26:18] testimony about uh John Ryan as I
[26:20] started a quote from that a while ago.
[26:22] Uh there was a woman a few u minutes got
[26:24] a ger hanging on her throat and while we
[26:27] was praying for her went away here here
[26:29] come John Ryan back pushing through all
[26:31] the ushers as after he already come up
[26:33] one time for prayer coming back again
[26:35] and man was helping him in prayer line
[26:37] and uh said I want to see that preacher.
[26:39] So they brought him up there and he said
[26:41] to me you told me I was healed. I said
[26:43] you are. He said well if I was healed I
[26:46] could see. He said oh no that's had
[26:49] nothing to do with it. And he said, "You
[26:51] told me you believed." He said, 'Well,
[26:53] you said I was healed. You said you
[26:54] believed. I do believe you. Then what
[26:56] are you doubting about? Well, if I was
[26:58] healed, couldn't I see? Obviously, a
[27:01] man, I think he had a Catholic
[27:02] background. He didn't understand that if
[27:04] I'm healed, shouldn't I be able to see
[27:05] now? You know, and he said, "Well, you
[27:08] will see. God showed me a vision that
[27:10] you were seeing. It has to happen." I
[27:11] was as a Catholic. Never been taught
[27:13] anything like that, but I don't
[27:14] understand. What should I do? And he
[27:15] said, "Well, the only thing you do is go
[27:17] down the road." He got cut off. He just
[27:19] went on to say, "Confess it." basically.
[27:21] So, um the point was keep confessing
[27:25] your healing no matter what. John Ryan's
[27:26] eyes did come open as y'all know the
[27:28] testimony. He went on testifying in
[27:30] church and and uh selling newspapers. I
[27:33] think saying extra extra read all about
[27:34] it. Thank the Lord for healing me. His
[27:35] eyes were still closed naturally
[27:37] speaking at that time. He could see
[27:39] taste smell here those symptoms but his
[27:42] eyes did come open and that barber chair
[27:44] and Barbara went chasing him down the
[27:46] road. So point is just maintain a
[27:48] positive confession. And that's my main
[27:50] point. Just keep positive confession and
[27:51] believe God no matter what. God bless
[27:54] you. Thank you.
[27:56] [Applause]
