I want to S to you to see you high and lift shining in the light of your glory pour out your power and love we sing Holy Holy hly amen I and lifted Shing in the light of your glory pour out your power and love as we holy holy holy amen and amen holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy I want to see amen and amen and amen you want to see him we just look around and you'll see him amen it's good to see everybody in the house of the Lord if you'd like to turn in your scripture turn to Romans 8 and Genesis 2 Romans 8 Genesis 2 and we'll try to get into our thought we was trying to take up this morning but having a lot of company then that way we kind of drop back and we can move on you know and and do the best we can but we appreciate company we're glad to come and be with us and let them hear about the word of the Lord and all and we just pray one for another amen uh remember the announcements uh sister Johnny still sick with the the old uh Ivy there Poison Ivy and sister Kathy was having a lot of trouble and all their sick stomach so remember all of these remember the ones that are not here I think Brother Dean down preaching for his brother to remember them and just keep the keep us all together in your prayers we thank the Lord for touching our wife she's doing a whole lot better and and able to uh to do and things and and uh she uh when when she feels better I work cuz she gets things arranged and says we got to do this so you know and I'm glad to do it I'm not making that remark wrong I told her the other day I said I'm glad you're feeling better because you know I understand and all and I enjoyed that song there and but while I was sitting there thinking about it and the sister was singing I thought yep she done it y'all didn't know what sister Anna done did you she sneaked her picture up onto the thing her face on the where that Brother Anderson could see her out in California nobody had that on their mind did they look at sister Anna her face is red she knew what she was doing she was singing to Brother Anderson you know and it's all right I just thought that okay Romans 8 and Genesis 2 you know I U you know I don't know everything and there's not always a knowledge of everything but I knew something would be different this morning and so you know you just wait and see because I I didn't know how much company was coming but uh you know you'd have to be me to understand sometimes I know exactly what's doing but then sometimes I I'm just not right I thought something wrong you know why why why can't I be free to move on and in my speaking well see company coming then the Lord will let you know not to do that and know you know I knew it in the night last night and and this morning and things it just like okay all right I've learned on that to just say all right we take whatever comes and and we'll work from there okay so we'll try to pick up our thought this afternoon right Romans 8 Genesis to Heavenly Father we thank you for your grace and your love unto us thank you Lord that you can speak to us that you can burden Us in certain ways and and open our eyes in other ways and we pray that you'd help us and we believe father that we we try to do the best we can so just just take us and use us for what whatever Lord and and we thank you for letting us know sometimes ahead of time when things are going to be different maybe uh somebody's sick something's wrong but we we know that you're with us and we thank you have your way guide us now as we read your word and speak about you keep us in Jesus name amen Romans 8 we're glad that brother dick sister Gail didn't get to go to Florida too you know they might not be but but we are okay Romans 8: 2028 and we know that all things work together for good to them that love God to them who are the called according to his purpose for whom he did for know he did also predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many Brethren moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called and whom he called them he also Justified and whom he justified them he also glorified what shall we then say to these things if God be for us who can be against us amen let's go over to Genesis now and we'll pick up uh we'll just start with verse four of Genesis 2 these are the generations of the heavens and the earth when they were created in the day that the Lord God made the earth and the heavens and every plant of the field be before it was in the earth and every herb of the field before it grew for the Lord God had not caused it to rain upon the Earth and there was not a man to till the ground but there went up a mist from the earth and watered the whole face of the ground the Lord God formed Man Out of the Dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life and he became a living soul and the Lord God planted a garden Eastward in Eden and there he put the man whom he had formed amen you may be seated the Lord had his Blessing to the reading of the word now we know that uh we've been through it and uh it did give us this morning a little bit to back into the natural and and speak sometimes of things instead of I'm kind of more or less a push on push on sometimes I have to divert around and that's good it helps me helps you so you know we all get to benefit but we've been studying quite a while about the the Genesis 126 and 27 man the uh spiritual man uh the as we call it the the Son of God the uh God creating his own children and not uh being a creation but to be you know it's not something I I hope you followed the message so far uh we're not talking about God creating his children we're talking about God bringing his children into being cuz there's a lot of difference in the understanding of of creating something because then you begin to get the thoughts of of uh you know the uh uh something that didn't have any be I mean that had a beginning something that has an ending and stuff like that and you can get away from that and get into the understanding of seeing what's really taking place because that man that was created there was what was it it was God bringing forth the uh part that we were to be the the being and all and and being that but yet uh it's only one man now when we get back kind of towards the end of the message we we will get back to this where brother BR says God created a man he said now not all man right see this is not talking about the creation of all people right this is talking about a special creation of God himself to be made manifest on Earth in a form called the people of God you know and and being and that way it's a it's not a beginning it's a bringing forth It's a changing of form that we've been through over and over and over because that way then see he didn't have to create a man when he said let us make man in our own image it didn't mean that there wasn't that and then he created that it's meaning that he's bringing into being as we were trying to discuss at the Bible Study last night that you know this is to me is God revealing himself that's right the whole Bible the whole plan everything is God revealing himself right all right now for us we're on this side of it the recipiant or what you call it the receivers of Salvation right and I believe that eternal life that you have in you today by the new birth that that eternal life never had a beginning right right but I believe you and I had a beginning amen but now we're going to talk about Adam now the natural man Adam is will cover he had a beginning his body was not Eternal all right because he was created but the part that was placed within him we'll find as to be the part of God all right and we we you know we try to look at those things and follow it in a line see the natural creation of man took place on the sixth day you know the physical creation but the spiritual creation or the spiritual man just why what can you use what words can you use can I leave creation out of it no there's no way to talk can I leave beginning out of it no there's no way to talk but to people who understand what you're doing then see you can say he's the beginning of the creation of God but that's scripture and the prophet of God see said we are the rest of that creation well right now every how that Jesus Christ would be the beginning of the creation of God and I know that goes into the physical part of the body right which will be as we try to cover in the rest of the message today if we can to get down to you and I that our bodies one day will be made Eternal also but he was the beginning of the creation of God that was when God be to reveal what he was doing this is a revealing of God this is not a physical happening as I was explaining to him last night about the the uh Revelations 5 that's not a physical happening that's the acts or scene of a play you know and it what it's doing is is showing how God is revealing himself amen he's making himself known to you and I right well to make yourself known to you and I we are going to have to be of the same supernatural being to understand because the natural man cannot comprehend the things of God all right and in in doing that then see we had to have something so watch it in a minute Now watch how we we come forth not as the beginning but we that have eternal life today and I believe you must receive eternal life I don't believe as the people of the message teaching that you come into the world with eternal life I don't believe that even now watch Even Adam never came into the world with eternal life that's right God had to to breathe into his nostrils all right now if anybody would have started with it looked like Adam should have but the man Adam had to receive eternal life all right so if you and I have eternal life now that eternal life never had a beginning amen right but you and I did amen we had a time we have to be born again but now watch how wonderful it ties together with the understanding because as we read there in the scripture it says that God breathed into the nostrils of Adam and he become a living Soul now that's a wonderful thought a living soul we'll find in a minute that that was eternal life amen but you and I as a baby when a baby is born into the world God has to breathe into that baby's nostrils and it becomes a living soul all but it doesn't become an eternal one it's not like Adam you remember my point this being that when God begins doing something he doesn't begin it full grown I mean as a baby It Begins full grown all right so then if we watch Adam then we can see what to expect in you and I okay because Adam coming forth would be an example to you and me so let's watch him as he comes into being a and the doings and all and what God does to bring this man into being and then we can understand what would happen to bring us into being you know in the in the bases of what we're seeing all right so then to think about it the first man was made a spiritual being in in the image of God a supernatural being he was a leader of the animals in the garden all of those things we've been through it how that he comes down to that position and there's only one that would have eternal life so the eternal life that God would give to Adam would not be a beginning but would what would be the word what is a good word for that an extens a multiplication of God or or bringing forth you know as God just bringing it into being and not creating it we get away from those words creation or get away from the word beginning cuz you can't read the Bible correctly then cuz you read in the beginning was the word well there's a time when the word begin in the beginning was the word so the time the word begin and the word is with God so God began you see what I'm saying those are human terminologies but are not expressing the understanding of what's taking place because God never had a beginning that's right it never had a ending you say but yet that's talking about uh the flesh no the Bible's for sick in the beginning was word where with God the Word was God then verse 14 says and the Word was made flesh right and dwelt among us see that spiritual man come down to dwell with natural man amen that spiritual man of almighty God came into being to come down and dwell upon Earth in a body called Jesus Christ all right now let's watch how that comes into being and then think about ourselves and consider our own s eles in in the things that we're doing so now Man was created on the sixth day physically he was created before the foundation of the world as the spiritual man the 126 man as I said a moment ago that's not everybody that's only one man there's only one man that's ever had or ever will have eternal life right he said wait a minute now he can give eternal life yeah but you didn't understand what I was saying eternal life is God that's God's own life if he imparts it it's still what he done all right but think about it now this spiritual man in the image of God the Loos the opony ETC Son of God was not another being separate from God right but was a part of God Amen right now that's what we've been trying to get to point to you a part of God all right then that supernatural being being a part of God then it had no beginning right now I'm not talking about Adam we're going to get to that just a second Adam the flesh man had a beginning all brother Brown says on the future home paragraph 431 32 he said that the tree of life was in the garden to remind Adam that his newth youth was continually going on even the way he was placed even to bring into Adam as we'll read in a minute that supernatural being even into Adam and doing that still that didn't make that body Eternal right just because we have eternal life in our soul does not make the body Eternal am even the body of Jesus it was not Eternal it had a beginning that's why I brought around and said you see Jesus had a beginning he said but God had no beginning he said Jesus had a beginning he said he had a mother and a father we know his mother and father was almighty God the word all right now but coming down to seeing what we doing and looking at Adam as God beginning him as full grown he gives an example of what he wants all of his children to be an example in Adam that spiritual man had control of the earth he ruled the animals now once he was put into flesh he didn't lose that ability he could control the animals and even in his lost estate the animals are still afraid of mankind and are easily uh trained by man you know because they recognize him as their ruler and any animal that there is wants you to be not mean to it but it wants you to be dominant ating you know it wants you to be in command see because they say that like a horse that it can tell whether or not you're scared they can tell and if you're scared the horse is scared that's right but if you're not scared then see it becomes to the bases it knows you're in control all you take a dog and it can be vicious but yet to some people that dog is not vicious at all cuz he knows they're in control and he'll respect that person now he might attack other people because that's the feeling that that in some way it knows whether you're in charge or not all right but now think about it Adam's Body was not Eternal so when it says you know he created a man we know Genesis 1 was the spiritual creation Genesis 2 is the physical creation of mankind all right and God breathed into his nostrils the physical creation and he became a living Soul now I want you to watch that watch that part and he became a living soul and you'll see that that we wasn't born with eternal life we must receive eternal life amen amen and to receive eternal life we become a living Soul that's right you say well now brother Dale do you mean that the other people that are not born again or or not a living no but they're not that kind of a living Soul there're a living Soul because they are given life right yeah but only those who have eternal life can be qualified or counted as a living Soul so you following what I'm saying because the Bible says they're dead while they living Paul said you were dead in sin only those that are born again so now here's what we're going to get to so so I'm going to say it and then back up get into the message so when God breathe into your nostrils eternal life by the new birth are you listening by the new birth and only by the new birth can you and I be Eternal so when he breathes into our nostrils you might be 10 years old 40 years old 80 years old whatever you know until that time you're not a living Soul well come on just get off of it just listen to what I'm saying I've explained that a second ago when God breathes into your a baby's nostrils it becomes a living person a living soul but it doesn't have eternal life so when you receive the new birth you then become a living Soul that's the way we should have come y That's right right we shouldn't have to went through the fall but we did so when you receive the new birth you become a living Soul you have eternal life now follow that point because see what happened to Adam Adam was both male and female right and even in the spiritual creation we've covered that that even when Adam was put in flesh Adam was lonely because Eve was still in theophany until God created a flesh taken from Adam and place within her that part that she was to be amen that theophany that Soul cuz I believe your soul is your theophany right I believe a sinner soul is his theophany it's his body that he's going places he's going downward but to a true Christian is going upward all right but see God took that part that he see I use the word set aside that makes another Point see the human mind I believe in the expanding of God and I believe that's what he's been doing right that he is expanding himself and as I've tried to explain to you see we want to take great father up here and he want to make a logos over here and a this over here and a man and and and we want to R this out put this over here I never have believed that I believe the more that God unfolds of himself even to the foolish virgins the people given eternal life I believe that's enhancing him am not doing away with what's here that's what we want all God was he p in and all Christ he we see then you're running out of God see that way it takes a revelation amen I listen we was the other day to brother random and he's talking about I would he said it's got to be revealed when the lady asked him one you one of the questions said you know how could he be two people and all like that he said it's got to be revealed one God has got to be revealed what I'm talking about today has got to be revealed to you I'm not talking of the little six and seven sermons of other people I'm trying my best to get you and I to do as the prophet said he said when the Bri bride realizes who she is and what she's here for right then she'll be able to speak things into existence that's paraphrased it in my language then she'll be able to be used of God but until that time we're not we're not at that place right we're in the growth development all right and I don't believe all God poured into to the church is completed until all the members of the body of Christ coming in it's all right so we're in a process all right now so follow what I'm talking about before the foundation of the world God said let us make man right and he made a spiritual being eternal life right that was a part of his life part of him not like a part of him like a part like a leg or an arm or what a part of God is God you you can't have God in Parts well he's here part no no it's that's why John could represent the bride of Christ on the a of patmas why because he had eternal life right so anyone with eternal life can represent all the rest of the body right right all right now that's what I've been trying to get you to see but look what happened this natural man came into being natural man Adam there was no man to K the soil all right so he put him in the garden brother brand said there he stood said I can you see I read it to you the other day there stands Adam coming up out of the earth that his feet sticking into the very Earth did he come from yeah but what's he doing see then God breed into his nostrils the Bible says and he became a living Soul all right now so what happened was that God put the spiritual creation right into the physical creation right all right making him Adam with eternal life he put into him the things so go ahead and pick up number six now and we'll try to get started and uh this is taken from the deity of Jesus Christ paragraph 49 11 uh 12:25 but there was no man to till a soil so God made Man Out of the Dust of the earth and that man he might have given him hands like a monkey he might have give him feet like a bar whatever he did he just throwed it together and made a man but this man what he put this Immortal Spirit That Never Dies into this man and he become more than a brute he become a man he put this spiritual man as we'll read more quotes he put this Genesis 12 126 man into Genesis 2:7 right orever what it is two two yeah seven right all right then it makes you an I remember the prophet said he said a man without the Holy Ghost is nothing more than a brute an animal all right so he's expressing he puts this Immortal Spirit That Never Dies into this man and he become more than a brute he become a man right going to the next one which is one that's preached in 1962 uh to1 paragraph 145 146 see nothing has a soul but man you go through the things that sheep don't have no you don't know God put he's an an he's an animal form that's true but he put a soul on him that's what made him different from the animals he know right from wrong when his soul come on him but he remember when God created man in his own image and then he become a living Soul see he become that knowing right from wrong so now remember we are talking today only of Adam right right right do everybody with me will you agree with me or what you do you remember what I said this is talking about Adam this is not the creation of all mankind Adam was the first man of the Earth all right this is not talking about when you come into the world and what you get this is talking about Adam and how everything begun all right so keep that in mind now what we're talking about look at number eight uh questions and answers 6 uh 54 516 5:15 paragraph 280 and if God made man in his own image what kind of a man did he make then a spirit man in Genesis 2 there was no man to tell the soil and God made Man Out of the Dust of the earth not in His image but in the image of animal and he put the spirit of man in this animal here and he become a living soul mhm right now that's the difference between a man and an animal as I said now keep in your mind we're only talking about Adam I've explained it over and over to you that even the man in the natural estate of being lost he still has a superiority over the animals but he's talking about putting this Spirit of this 126 man man into the Genesis to man right now follow him on then the cruelty of sin the penalty that cost man which is uh 53403 paragraph 55 made him out of the Dust of the earth now not in his own image he had already made the man right he didn't make the Genesis two Man In His Image he made him image of an animal he already created a man right then he breathed into him the breath of life now and he become a living Soul so the soul of man is the nature of the spirit so he breathed into him in other words he put Genesis 1:26 into Genesis 27 right and Adam became a living Soul that's what made him a living Soul it would have done no good to just gave him natural life he gave him eternal life that's what we're going to read all right so that's going to the next one this is questions and answers on Genesis 53 729 paragraph 46 now but then there was no man to tell the soil Genesis 2 no man to tell the soil and then God formed man Genesis 27 Out of the Dust of the earth and we follow it he formed Man Out of the Dust of the earth and put this Supernatural spirit all right I'm just trying to establish a point in your mind what happened in the garden God put to Genesis 1 26 and 27 man into the Genesis 2 man and he called him a living soul but this living Soul had eternal life we'll read that in a minute watch now we'll get to this one also he comes on down and he's jump things he he breathe breathe the breath of life into him he become a living Soul now he began to move on and move on he become a living Soul when he breathed into his nostrils all right now let's read we've read this before but did you follow it let's read Blasphemous names of what he says about this man all right so let's start and just read we got a whole bunch of reading from this but I want you to follow the thought this is taken from uh blasphemist names paragraph 184 through about 191 somewhere in there now Jehovah Witnesses in their book it says that the breath that you breathe is the soul now now that cannot be right the breath that you breathe is not Soul if it is you're you're one time you're one kind of a soul next time you're something else as breathe that soul look where you'd be see now the breath is the wind and the wind is where you breathe into your nostrils now they take the scripture from back and look what they use and God breathed into his nostrils and he became a living Soul that's the scripture because remember ever Doctrine has a scriptural background I didn't say the scripture background every Doctrine starts from the scriptures of what people interpret it to be right not that's what that's what Run's explaining that's not what the scripture is talking about all right now they take the scripture from back and God breathed breath into his nostrils and then became a living Soul words that's their way of explain it that you become a living Soul when he breathe so then when you breathe your soul goes out somebody else breathes in I'm me today I'm brother colie in the second I'm backwards and forth he said that's not the soul right amen now watch it then now I want to ask you something if he was a man what kind of breath was he breathing before God breathed his breath of life into him see what kind of breath he was a breathing living man well then if that be so then every animals a living Soul cuz they breathe a human soul and our soul and all together so now you're saying that not just people breathe in each other Soul now the animals would bre breathing and get into if you want to study something something without getting massively confused go into the the uh strong concordance and pick up the word soul and follow it in comparison with the word spirit and you'll find that it's a total interchangeable word right and it's numes or something like that it's I forgot how to pronounce it I don't really you know and I couldn't even spell it but it's something to that it just means life life see that's what man thinks of a soul life you know no life eat it life right so we can breathe in and out life no it's it's the point I'm telling you read it the only defining of between Soul and Spirit in the Bible is Hebrews what is it 4:12 the word has to divide because in the the strongest concordance even where it uses Spirit there is only one definition of spirit and when it says holy spirit it's the same definition as is the spirit of man right because they couldn't Define it but what have I always said what the text that it's talking about right explains what it is if it say in Holy Spirit it means the spirit of God if it says man's spirit it's just man's spirit all right we' tried to be through that through the years to help us to understand but watch see he said Brothers the arguments don't stand look read the human soul and our soul together then Jesus wouldn't have had to Die the animal sacrifice would have been sufficient if it [Applause] just you know in everybody's Soul then the animal sacrifice would have been sufficient because the animal would be breathing there need to be a soul where it says AR the scripture if you notice it says and all of the souls in the sea died or he gave up the souls that were in the sea or something well now what that means is they got this little place made down here no it's just meaning animal life right the animals in there but an animal down in the ocean don't breathe like we breathe now there is animals that has to come up to breathe and go back down okay but now follow me all right he said brother now the argument don't stand look but what God did he breathed the breath of eternal life now listen he amen he became a living Soul a soul that can't die he's talking about Adam right go we'll call his name in a minute he'll read his name in a minute watch now watch we're going to get into honey plumet elbows breathe the breath of eternal life into his nostrils and he became an eternal soul Who's it talking about Adam now watch because God breathe not what nature done but what God did God breathed the breath of life into his nostrils and he became a living soul and you say to me Adam died brother brandom watch you but remember before he died he had a lamb that redeemed him all right those who he fornew is called he got a lamb to redeem him he was a type Adam fell then the lamb was provided for ad Adam watch because already in his nostrils had become the breath of the Eternal God already in Adam's nostrils when he breathed the Breath of Life what he done he put to Genesis 126 man over into the 27 man right he put the spiritual man over into the physical man and remember he started in full grown now keep that in your mind watch because already in his nostrils had become the breath of Eternal of the Eternal God so how could God let Adam fall right so you're going to redeem him okay and he become a living Soul he was a Son of God not his breath as the African word I don't know what the Greek word is for right now but the African word they call it amoya which means the wind are an unseen Force animals breathe amoya Sinners breathe the Moya then why would we struggle for eternal life if that's the Eternal Soul breathe into us by breath why would we try why would we struggle for it why would we struggle for eternal life it backs fars brother it just can't do but God specifically upon Adam especially excuse me especially upon Adam breathed the breath of eternal life and he became an eternal person with God he took the 126 man and put him in the two7 right remember Eve was in Adam in 27 right that we've done cover Eve was in Adam in 126 right amen come on now look he had power was God he was an amateur God he was God of the earth not God of the heaven watch now God of the earth and someday the sons of God will have again become Gods am Jesus said so is not it written into your law you're gods and if you can call these who be called God who God visited how can you condemn me saying when I say I'm the Son of God now we're getting into something deep now watch this when we drive it on down go ahead think about it now especially into Adam and he become a living Soul he's not talking about the rest of us because as I said he made man not a man but he didn't make man all of us with this form or ability some people will never have eternal life right right right so now listen to what I'm saying and you'll get the point of what I keep driving at so God puts the 126 man into the 27 right right he puts the spiritual man into the physical body now you tell me that's not exactly what he done with has done with the new birth right amen the new birth puts the spiritual man the eternal life that the offy of God the Eternal into you and I then we become a living soul but he began Adam as a living Soul everything after then we just get life permitted to prophit L let's see uh and knoweth it not I'm pretty sure he said he permitted us to be born the way we were born he didn't make us to do but he permitted it cuz he had to bring into natural people but look what he goes to questions and answers in 62 527 just to cure the thought on God created the whales and the Sea he done everything and made the creation made man in his own image man not a man whole man all of them in his own image he didn't do that he didn't make all of Man In His Image image follow him see you're reading scan over fice you just read all of them in His image you see everybody's In His Image no only those who have eternal life today in their soul are in the image of God right if nothing else we're brute beasts made to be destroyed right amen but the children of God have eternal life so he didn't make just all man with eternal life in God's image sure we know the message I preached it to you even in man's a fallen estate he's close to the image of God but remember image means exact likeness everybody don't have eternal life that's what I'm want to drive down only Adam received eternal life in his soul because when sin entered the picture nobody else could come with eternal life because you would have an eternal sinner sensible right you don't have eternal Sinners so everything after adamy begin him full grown now watch that in a minute and let's see if we can come the same way but look what he says Made man his own image made man not a man whole man all of them in his own image so you didn't do that he so well you're reading that one way I'm reading it the other way well you read it the other way and let's see what you got come on you read it in your language what you got you got an all man born with eternal life now you got the people of the message running into and even they don't agree I've never heard anybody agree that all men come with eternal life have you I mean always has got to bride the little select group they never cover all man with eternal life so then back up and read it again read it from your revelation God took the Genesis 116 man which was eternal amen or eternal life he put it into Genesis 2 and Adam became a living Soul right when God G gives you and I the new birth our soul becomes Eternal why because the Genesis 1 126 Man part that you was to be brother dick is put into to you at the new birth not born into you naturally if it's Born Into You naturally then everybody's saved we just all go into heaven let's have a good time no no no no no they don't fit the Redemption how can you redeem you don't talk about Redemption if everybody's saved you remember Jehovah Witness Doctrine the devil wanted to save everybody so that must be his Doctrine right but are you listening Blasphemous names tells us Mormons excuse me Adam was the only one that received eternal life and remember that even at the time Adam received eternal life Eve was not in existence you know physically she was in Adam amen she had to be removed from Adam and then she was still in theophany remember and wasn't complete because part of him was still in the you remember all the quotes now we're looking at that man being put into flesh Eve's in that man but her soul is still in God because it had been brought into being as Eve remember it wasn't brought into beginning as Eve either right Eve is the Fallen name her name was not Eve it was woman her her name was Adam come on Eve's name was not Eve until the fall when she become to fall it says then she's the mother of all living her name was Adam right okay our name is Miss Jesus are we still in the Redemptive her name is not Samuel D you know James col whatever her name is Miss Jesus amen that's why we don't have a name the Bible says the denominations have a name Revelations three or two they have a name that they're living but dead that's right why because it's a Baptist Methodist Presbyterian bromite Lula HUD the ites whatever you want to make them long you got the ey on the end of we messed up Israel was fine until they become Israelites but are you following me into Adam we read from Blasphemous 9 especially into Adam he breathed eternal life so he never breeded into any other mankind I'm going to say this and then I'll have to hold it for a second one day there was a little body born that was a creation and had a beginning and that little baby stepped forth from its mother and when it did he breathed the Breath of Life into Jesus and he became an eternal living Soul amen right right so you see what we're going to right go ahead with the next what we got and then lost my count of where we're at oh we're already on 13 man we're doing good with life and about all of these add-ons and things but listen think about it think about what he's done so then the man Adam the man Adam was a beginning you know an example cuz God begins all of his Creations as full grown now you watch because you say but now wait a minute Jesus become Jesus was an example of you and I that would start as a baby and that's why the Bible says we receive the earnest of our inheritance right which is eternal life all right so he would have to be the example child to come as a baby and grow up to full grown but when he become full grown he was recognized right so it brought it into a condition existence that you and I can dwell in but I want you to think about it if Adam was the example son then all of God's children will follow the example of Adam you go with me we follow the example of Adam because even Jesus would be following the example of Adam as we've covered that God could breathe into that little baby when he was born from Mary the breath of eternal life he didn't have to receive eternal life later he was given it as a baby Adam was a full grown man because God would begin his creation that way he wasn't a baby that growed up and then God breathed into his nostrils Adam started it off okay let's read something here then this is also from Blasphemous names paragraph 23 32 the church is a mystical Body of Christ born of the Breath of God oh did you get it did you get it the congregation is supposed to say Amen the Church of God is born of the Breath of God right so now we're fixing to come into being just like Adam came into being on the day of Pentecost the Holy Ghost came the soul of God right right divided among the people so on the day of Pentecost he put into to the church come on the part that they was to be we call him Peter James John but he calls him his offspring and remember the 120 in the upper room were already not what would be called capped off headstone people but they had three and A2 years of training so they wouldn't little bitty babies he's going to start his church off the same way he started Adam Off full grown okay now brother uh if I quote this wrong I get it um brother Henry green I believe now if I miss it forgive me he quoted brother brandham as saying one time and I wasn't there and heard it but I've heard people say he said it that God started his church off the way he wanted it he wants the church to be the way he started it I can see that right he wants you and I to be the way the church started he started it the way he wanted it and he wants us to be what he started in the manifestation great wonderful opportunity in this last days so the church is a mystical Body of Christ born to the Breath of God a Church of God is born to the Breath of God God breathed into the nostrils spiritually of Adam I read and he become a living Soul did you know the Pentecostal or the true Pentecostal church is born of the Breath of God right you don't have to pull up the just run it on up brother Rich because you don't have to pull up John cuz we had John but leave it leave it down just a little all right cuz this is John 20 you know that where he says this at cuz you can read John 20 if you want to because this is where it said it let me read you something just a minute that's on it let me see just a minute St John I believe where I'm going to we'll find out whether the Church of where the Church of God is or not in other words where it's born to the Breath of God or Not St John let's see I believe that's about 1619 which is really uh John 2022 right there is where you begin all right here I believe we'll have it right here all right let me read you and see whether the church is born to the Breath of God or not like Adam was in the beginning so you and I are going to have to be born or come forth like Adam did or we're not the church okay follow it and the same day at evening he starts quoting the scripture being the first day of the week when the doors were shut and the disciples were assembled for fear of the Jews Jesus came and stood in the midst of them and said unto them peace be unto you now this is after the resurrection of the Lord Jesus amen right if I can read it this is after the resurrection of the Lord Jesus this is not while he was in the life with him amen this is after his resurrection okay look what he said he said unto them he showed them his hands and his side then were the disciples glad when they saw the Lord and Jesus and then Jesus said unto them peace be unto you as my father has sent me so send I you now what did the prophet say that that meant he said God came came down and went in Jesus he said that's the way God and Jesus was the same right he said how does he send his church he comes down and goes in his church making her and him one right okay now watch the father that sent him went in him and Jesus when he descends as disciple he goes in him same one sent God and when he said un said this he breathed on them and said receive ye the Holy Ghost amen now watch it Church born to the Breath of God now you better notice where he puts it to right because you remember [Music] now when the Holy Ghost fell on the church at Pentecost it fell on tutored Sons and Daughters of God brother random according to Statue of perfect man he said the holy ghost that fell on on Pentecost put them at brotherly kindness right okay but said when we Reed the new birth we start at Faith why because they were tuted and trained for three and a half years right so he started his church full grown right right when he breathed on the upper room people was full grown now let me give you an example because of the rest of what I'm doing uh was all 120 with him when he breathed on them and said receive you the Holy Ghost I don't know whether they would or not probably wouldn't but that didn't make no difference but what if he's talking to 3,000 people and he breathed on him and said receive you the Holy Ghost you see where you got to have a revelation to follow things because only the 120 in the upper room would have the capability of standing amen at brotherly kindness rest of them couldn't stand there it didn't mean that God didn't speak to them but it meant a difference like I've always said the Bible said that Jesus after his resurrection read your scripture was seen of over 500 Brethren right not called them Brethren and they could have come on and become Christians but how come 120 is all that made it to the upper room okay and when do we get to the next part where we'll read what brother Brown says this means so just follow with me Church born to the Breath of God when this stature has molded itself up there in condition right this is what the disciples had in the upper room Holy Spirit they didn't have the headstone brother run said they didn't you when they had a portion don't go into all of that just say what he says they didn't have the headstone cuz he said The Headstone hadn't come yet amen he said it was to come in the last days what when the church is molded up into the condition all right so Follow Me Now Church born to the Breath of God when there stature has molded itself up there in condition God's Breeze breath upon them receive receive the Holy Ghost then you are a son of God you can join anything you want to I love that you may not like that to a lot of people you know what they said brother brandom say it you telling me to come out of them denomination brother Brandon said I can join anything I want to that's right that's what he said right you got his word words but see you failed to listen to the others where he said go ahead and stay there he said let your light shine and they'll throw you out so evidently a lot of people ain't been letting their light shine they still there I say brother Dale in the end time message go ahead and run with all these churches you want to you know believe this two Souls Two Lord 700 this presid but let your light shine and you'll find out you won't be there long right I was not throw out of the Baptist Church they wanted me to stay but I've been thrown out of this message the only two churches I've been in since I've been got thr out of them not because I fussed and argued with the pastor but it's because I didn't agree with him so you see that's just personal okay he says molded himself up there in condition God breathes breath upon them receive ye the holy Holy Ghost and you're a Son of God you can join anything you want to but you're born into the Church of the Living God born by the Breath of God God breathed upon them and said receive ye the holy receive ye we the holy ghost oh my there you are and he talks about coming up with the soup suppers and going all the time but when you become a child of God you are born by the Breath of God Amen better leave it alone right there now all right so the disciples come right here and we're born again right there where it says holy spirit born by the Breath of God when we come into the body of Christ we come into the body of Christ at Faith being the earnest of our inheritance but you're still born by the Breath of God you're just not molded in stature the new birth is the new birth it's the Breath of God when you receive eternal life right here at at Faith you don't have to grow all the way up here to get eternal life that's the difference in the day of Pentecost it like it took years to express and explain on the day of Pentecost the 120 were right here only the spirit but the next message outside they were born again at Faith cuz they never heard the message but yet they were born babies but the disciples wouldn't born babies that's why none of those babies of the 3000 was chose to write the word right Apostle Paul was the only one that wouldn't have of the room of the ones that was chosen because God don't trust his word with a novice okay Church born by the Breath of God like Adam was was especially into Adam he gave him he took the 126 man he put it into Adam amen Adam was a full grown man on the church on the day of Pentecost he took the 126 man and put it into the church on the day of Pentecost Peter James John Etc breathed upon them before he remembers after his resurrection I pull up the last quote and then we'll quit look what he says what about this brother Dale did they receive the Holy Ghost so that be a good Doctrine wouldn't it be a good Doctrine in these end time people that believe you come into the world with eternal life and always was was eternal doctrines and two Souls Two Lords and all kind of things and they'd say see th he breathed on them and said receive you the Holy Ghost now you just destroyed your own Doctrine that's mean I know it see when you say he breathed on them and said receive you the Holy Ghost it evidently meant he didn't have it before then so if he was even going to use that you'd be in bad shape right did they get to Holy Ghost the day Jesus breathed on him brother brandom questions and answers in 64 book 4 64 8:30 evening paragraph 60 dear brother brandom what is the difference between when Jesus breathed on the disciples and said receive you the Holy Ghost and when they when they had to go to the upper room to T what's the difference brother BR it was a promise he gave them he never gave them the holy ghost that day the day he breathed on him he never gave him the Holy Ghost read it it was a promise he gave them breathed upon them his promise and said receive the Holy Ghost it was a promise they went to the upper room to wait for the promise to be fulfilled amen right now folks what have we been doing 40 [Music] years we believe we have eternal life by the new birth as I said Upper Room experience was 120 of have been tutored and that put them where it says holy spirit on the pyramid the 3,000 that come later started as babies you know why because Jesus started as a baby right you ever heard brother randam said he was an example to everybody he said he was a baby to the babies he said he was a teenager to the teenagers right he said he was an adult to the adults you haven't heard him say that if you need it call he was example of all things he received eternal life as an example as a baby just like you and I receive eternal life when we're first born again you know what happens then God puts the 126 man into the two into the 27 you know amen when you receive eternal life by the new birth that is the 126 man cuz that's only one man the man Christ Jesus amen all right then he puts that man when you receive the new birth into you in baby form and I baby form m a growth development begins and we start up the stature of a perfect man and when this image is formed into being when that image back there that man Christ Jesus when he come into maturity God spoke from heaven and said this is my beloved Son in whom I'm pleased to dwell right right and when the finish of his ministry for three and A2 years he grew in Grace and knowledge the Bible says and then in Matthew about 17 it says another time happens this time that time he was out in the public this time he was drawn away that only Peter James and John saw it and he was taken up right and he said this is my beloved Son in whom I'm pleased to dwell hear you him he adopted his own son into the family when you and I come to the position Church of being adopted and that's what's going to bring to pass the Rapture is an adoption of the Bride of Jesus Christ all right right not because we believe the message or shout Glory Hallelujah that's right it's when God has seen his own life in you and I he will adopt his own life he don't adopt an immature son right and he only adopts those who have stood the training tutoring and become into the manifestation that supposed to be Romans 8 says the world is waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God waiting on you and I God gave us a new birth he breath into our nostrils put the 126 man into us right but we got to grow up amen right right right grow up into him the scripture says and then he can breathe upon you and adopt you same way Jesus you see Adam started full grown so he didn't have to come up and be adopted right the church came on a day of Pentecost and full grown they couldn't make it up to adoption why cuz you and I wouldn't there is that sensible and neither was the full word to come for Redemption born by the Breath of God he breathed on us and we become a living Soul you may be 10 years old 20 years old 70 years old 80 years old but when you're born again God breathes into your nostrils eternal life he puts that 126 man that you and I to be into this human flesh and we become God's Offspring I don't see what's so secretive or mystery or deep things when it's so simple that it ties together every scripture in the Bible but yet are we like one man told me one time or was in my presence he said that uh that adoption is simple he said that statue of perfect man is confusing I thr on God that's my pastor that's what I thought that's my pastor can I go any further than that no while I'm here because adoption and stature of perfect man is the same thing right but yet to him one of them was simple and one of them was deep you see why it's always a climbing coming out of and in to if you find any place any further advanced in what word is being preached and you have here let me know we'll be there the next Sunday I'll pay everybody's way and we'll see what that is you tell me any preacher that preaches any greater than thoughts and I'm not saying I'm the top get it off yet I'm saying if you know of anything can help us let me know I'll be glad to call them and fly them in from West Africa India China or the moon if it takes it because I want us helped what you see if people can take that Jesus breathed on them and they become a living soul and Jehovah Witness and make that the soul of man just be in the hour you breathe let's be careful of the doctrines we hear right let's be thankful for the truth and to do the best we can let's stand we're going into the communion go ahead brothers and
