TRANSCRIPT
========================================
could be announced before today it's gonna have all of us like I say I didn't have a home Thompson Thompson there you go I meant I was gonna say Thomas because next unit maiden name that's why I keep going over in my head oh no Dean Thompson oh not a wife not a doubting Thomas how to down a Thompson and I believe in not a believing high so we've been on the book of Revelation here for the past few months and now we're on Revelation chapter 5 but we'll go back to chapter 4 just for a minute after this which is after the church changes we were talking about last Sunday just for a background behold the door was open in heaven first voice which I heard was a trumpet talking to me and who's me means the bride means John okay so it's us which said come up hither and I will show thee things which must be Hereafter so as we know that's the type of the rapture and that is the rapture that we take because afterwards and as I was saying something be careful the property God tells us something right here that from chapter 4:1 the bride leaves the earth and she's not staying until revelations 19 and she comes back as a wife she leaves her the bride comes back to the wife right or person how much word lady right and there's three and a half years we know that we go to matched up religion that fulfills part of Daniel seventy weeks but this is all to the Jews so from revelations for one to revelations of 1921 is all to the Jews said oh by the way we got regulations 10700 them in the natural part is to the Jews they're still living them you know they got to go through the natural opening of the seals they got to go through the natural beast rising up out of the ocean and this all the different things go through they're going to go through that naturally even revelations 10:1 is a natural happening because he's going to descend to the Jews everybody I think but when we get the revelations 10 if if they had not been for revelations 10 7 inserted in there it would be I'll do you saw what about them they get Christ the same as we do that mighty angel that comes down to revelation 2:10 1 is the same by the angel that come to us a man when William rat on me with the Holy Ghost right all right so that's cue me but we see that he also when we leave he goes to the Jews and his Christ to the Jews right because we will look at bankruptcy we'll get to it and this is interactive if you want to prep off you want to stop and ask a question or make a comment go right ahead Freda sure does know so but we can converse back and forth this is not just me this is a this is a Sunday school if you need anybody needs to stop and some doing that's ok I like that because it so it helps us on my parents report school teachers all idea oh boy well you don't have to raise your name just go and so anyway so we go up after this after the church ages we leave and we're gone where we're over here in the 8th day if you're born again today you're already in the 8th day but we I like this word we physically no no no no we physically go into another dimension but we're changed here we're change here no then we physically take our physical bodies there are change glorified and we take it into another dimension while God does his work to the 100 well because he's not going to deal with us and them at the same time alright so they're waiting on us to get out of the way so that he can deal with the Jews and fulfill all this scripture in between here and the natural because remember Jews have to have something natural they have to beat by sight they have to be by touch we as Gentiles were supposed to take it by faith not by sight all right but the Jews are built on Darius coming touch my daughter come and do this go and do this but the Centurion siz up I'm a man of authority you're a man of authority amen if I say it and I have a hundred people and you know what he was saying he said if there's a hundred if there's a hundred diseases sir they're at your control whatever you say to them it'll happen it's done you're an authority that's the government of the man of authority you're a man of authority he noticed in Jesus that's some kind of power that nobody on that anyone that he had another soldier standing behind me I believe he had a revelation because you and I have to have a revelation of the same thing so we believe to see knots need to believe but now the Israel sees do believe they have to have a prophet standing on the earth they have signs they have to have this they have to have all these different things and we don't have to have that all right so now get out a party after this I looked over doors over to we go in a rapture but now remember though revelations for is they seen in heaven because he's going up hill but he's going to show him a revelation so he's going to show us a revelation this morning had to send us a prophet to show us as brother Andrew did a perfect job Sunday talking about symbols but those symbols have to become reality that if not they just a symbol the cloud the statue of a burning man all these things it that the property God brought us the church agents and how to position all this and put it all together without that we're just probing we're just sticking here and we're thinking maybe this will happen brother Brown said we can't be in other words presuming that's been chirring without authority but he brought the authority here not just to bring it here and then leave with it he brought it here and distributed it to us so that we at the time of John can take these mysteries and as brother Brown said take the big done he brought the big nuggets you know we have certain length of time to preach the message and then the 500 makes me breaks it down for the people to understand right because let's just listen imitates it's nothing that's your big nugget it just keeps to be a big night but he wants us to break it down and have a personal revelation my revelation is not that we've grounded them revelation my revelation is that God told me through that man and I have a revelation now you know what it does though it coincides with his revelation and it definitely better coincide with God's revelations of these perfect and brother Brown only Noah brought a perfect work he made mistakes he made slips at the time we know that he was a human being but when they come to the pure word and all the doctrines of the of the Bible he was never wrong amen so I mean it was in a spirit so now we're in the spirit so he worried we're in a spiritual realm now and then we saw all this happened last Sunday round about the throne with form 20 elders which is the white 12 apostles and 12 patriarchs aren't in the Old Testament but John must have been really happy because I don't believe there was an empty seat there he stole a cell sitting there all this 20 is a 23 and once he missed that he saw 24 seats and 24 people sitting and John was one of them all right so that's why that's why he keeps me I'm happy if he gets over to Revelation 5 he said I screamed out in the whole world hurt me why he knew he made it okay he saw herself but remember John was the Jew he needed to see and around microns for 26 and upon the seats I saw four and twenty elders we know who they were in white raiment and had crowns of gold on her head so the there's been up there in a position of authority and then out of the throne proceeded lightnings Dunnan there were seven lamps of fire burning before the grommets of the seven spirits of God now remember the seven spirits of God for the seven churches and the Seven for take messengers that were commissioned to give us no listen it wasn't it went Paul Irina's Martin climbing all them standing there it says the spiritual seven spirits of God so it was the characteristic of every church a okay characteristic but remember brother Brown says he took the characteristic of the age and fit it to the man right so the man fit the characteristics of God the spirit of God he fit that for that agent I look brother rather than fit I ringing Irene it's been Iranian property God he's been where he was that night so there's seven spirits who got before the throne sealed glass the midst of the throne round about throwing for peace no one of the four beasts the lion off the man the eagle full of eyes before and behind so in other words it doesn't matter where they turn they all were seemed they knew they had revelation and that to them that we know that's the baptism of Holy Ghost you have all four of those in you today working as a bold lion coming to churches and hops every Sunday and get nothing read your Bible and come to church on windy hope you don't have to get up and come to church or anything but you forget about your chair he comes turn home wait but that's the opps that's the labor that's the burden you know what that's your overcoming power right then you got the intelligence of man which is not man's knowledge but this knowledge this is the knowledge of God not the knowledge of man now the demand will do what presented but the knowledge of God cannot present the knowledge of God is straightforward and true and then of course the Eagle is this aids now which is higher hmm which is the higher revelation you see further and as I've always told you before Chris did the other days the man I still use that what you said in my church but you look at your for combat beasts the lion starts out he's a meat eater but he doesn't start out a mediator he starts out a milk drinker the Ox doesn't start eating grass the whole baby that was born the other night the Coco he's after that milk right now now he will rebel ate himself into eating grass the man sure we love to eat meat but when we start out as no babies drinking milk but now eagle does not know there is no milk bangs and an eagle it's all me own ministry cheers it up and I wish we could poke it down your throat but they do but when they're really young you know they're opening a mouth mama goes shut it down in there that's what we're trying to do now so that you can grow up and give it her heart did you ever study verse 7 appearances Hill rings but the faces of a lion on tap a man Alex people yes yes and Ryan had a problem with that because it says they are always moving forward how can you move forward with four sides well it just it turns and in a revelation you need they may not need the man's knowledge you may you may need some you may get up in the morning and need some ox so the officers are going to go forward it's not just a somebody standing with a face of a man facing them it was turned that when you need listen doc don't go sideways or backwards God go forward so if you need the Eagle anointing is forward it's right if it comes to the forefront of your of your of your whole ego go does yours thank God anymore that's right brother Graham said this is my God gave it to me he said it's now mine he said God gives me the Holy Ghost he said it's mine because he won't ever take it back once you give it to me so a lot of us man an eagle whatever you need for your journey is right here I step forward you may not need the intelligence today he may be back here somewhere you know not not hanging around but you may need that bonus of a line you may need the Hawks to get up out of bed to the church you may need the intelligence of man we'll see he's right here the whole time he's not having to twist he's right here he just comes to the forefront of your revelation he has come to the forefront you listen the Holy Ghost is that you remember we were we were I wish I want to try to find that where they at the Wailing Wall you never see them a true Orthodox you be still there doing this now they're not doing this because they just are bowing no they're doing this because they say that God is always in motion their God is always in motion even though they believe he ain't come yet you know the Messiah even though they believe in our area they believe he's still in motion in the way they do this when he woke up that wall they're saying god I'm in motion with you in other words when the Bible says be still and know that I am God man go sit down in the corner somewhere yeah I've always told us that people say well God give me a job and then they go home and sit down in the in the bedroom and don't get out for three or four weeks you'll still be there in three or four weeks because God wants you to do your part well that's the part you do when you step forward you're putting forth and ever yeah you're wanting to do something for God I don't come here and do this because I have to I come here because I want it I uh I'm a postal carrier I deal with all kind of goofy stuff and dirty during the week and I don't want to deal with Christian people all right then we know they had six wings and they flew us I can't get the revelation it's 5 min so in other words thou art worthy so now here revelation 5 this is - this is a scene in heaven but this is the whole plan of redemption in one chapter that's my brother around said this is the most sublime scripture in the Bible this one right here there's one that's the most important which is been Daniel but this is the most sublime script from the Bible one because it shows us and the total plan of redemption and it shows us down here a little further because remember John wept John taught the bride because no man was worthy but now wait a minute when we get on down here it says right here where to say right here and that's made us unto our God kings and priests we went from crying babies not know what's going on don't know anything about the plan of redemption we just know we're lost - right here and just nine verses please went from sniffling and crying to God making us not making ourselves as here that's made us a number we our self some 100 unto our God kings and priests and we shall reign on and that's also interpreted in Europe because you gotta reign here first before we can rain on a listen you gotta you gotta rain in here you gotta let dog rain here first before he allows you but look only in 9 verses we went from somebody that was unworthy to somebody that was worthy to even rule the world back to where Adam was in the Garden of Eden and brother Graham tells us he says if we're going to be kings and priests we got to be have something to rule over come the stage for a rule and reign and a different scripture says will rule and reign over the earth all right which is back to the Garden of Eden back to where Adam ruled all of God said hey I'll take care of the University you take care of here well he mixed it up but the second one didn't and now that the second one's inside of us there's where the rulership comes from we're promised in this last trkage an intimacy that no other church aids God weren't to sit in the throne his strum not our own throne were to set him his strum as he said in father from John 17 he says father I pray that they be one as we are one all right that's true one that's yes that's true one that's true oneness it's not worth like a personal God that's our problem that's why we're still here that's why we've been here for 50 years we think that Jesus is over here we're over here I thought the Bible says my hair isn't going as I thought he just said John 17 he prayed that we be one with him like he's one now how many are they between him and his daddy him at the Father 1 so I pray that we be one even is your honor one amen that's the problem we've got this thing where we're a second person we're going to wear another substance no we got it but we will see the new birth we have to realize we are these seven sons of God not a life substance inside but we go back to that what brother Dale have been talking about this 10:04 we gotta go I got one moment and I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice who is worthy to open the book and to loose the seals thereof and know and in heaven or in earth neither under the earth was able to open the book neither to look upon it and I went much because no man was found worthy to open and read the book neither to look thereon we'll stop what they're looking for god bless you thank you for I can't do this Oh Florida
