giving us an opportunity to see this blessed message and to be a part of it something that the world you know the world's looking for it they just can't find it Satan puts everything in the world I was thinking while I was watching brother Michael we I watched him since he was a little boy and he's a young man now and I pray that God keep his hand on him cuz he's got a work to do all of you young people you got a work to do cuz we are getting older we were talking yesterday at the post office and somebody said something and I said they said well you're just you know you act like a 30 year old you just you know I run circles around them I got one girl in there she's about 25 years old and I don't think she has a second gear just first gear is about all she's got but listen brother Tony if you got a transmission and ain't got but one gear you can't make a second gear she just don't have a second gear but we've seen those and and I told them I said well I said that's pretty good I said but you know I said to Lord terries I only got about 20 good years left I'll be 84 in 20 years so they and they all the whole the whole yeah well some of your older ones bless your heart but uh I mean when you think of it in that aspect you you time is short when you're 25 and 30 years old you do not think about uh Social Security and and which I'll get my first check next month and June June's already drawing hers so you'll be laughing she's older I mean she's um decided to draw hers before it all runs out but but when you look at it in that aspect you really don't have but about you know if you're 64 you may be 20 good years left even to be on this Earth and when you look at it that way I want to think about something greater I want I want to think about something that that carries us just like just like Abraham got the promised son took him 25 years to get it but he did get it so we've had a promise in the end time of a body change and of a resurrection and of going in a Rapture and going to another dimension for a little while to till God cleans this nasty Earth off then we're going to come right back down here and we're going to live here not in heaven on a cloud John saw the city coming down out of Heaven John was on Earth so we're going to have a city here this is where we're going to live God made this Earth to be inhabited he didn't make this Earth to be destroyed he made it to be inhabited he loved this Earth so much is where he put us he could have put us somewhere else brother Dy he put us right here in this Earth this is his and this is listen this is is our domain that's right Adam lost it Adam had it he was the god of the earth so what are we going back to Brother John you God can't change his mind we're just going to Loop right back around and we're going to be God of the Earth again amen but let's let let's see a little bit of it I was looking at Watching Sister Jessica in the back and I don't know if all of you know but sister Jessica's uh grandfather was one of our Pastors in at brother Homer Mansfield down in Athens some of you I don't know if some of you went to church there or not but I think Julie did and Janet but different ones but we started here in Gainesville and then we went to to her grandfather's and I've known her family longer than she has but here here we are full circle come back around and here the granddaughter stands in the church singing and uh we sure appreciate sister guest and brother Chris and sister Jessica all and we appreciate them we would have liked it if they' have brought some boys into the mix cuz it looks like all we got girls coming in whatever chromosome that is we ain't been able to figure out how to get a boy chromosone in this church but some of you can start some of us can't but uh but time's fleeting and we got to take every moment that we can for the Lord we've got to we've got this thing is going to end up with a group of people on the Earth called a bride and a bride of the end time a bride that has the message of the end time not a message of the first church age of the second church but a bride in the end time that has the message to call the dead out of the ground it's not going to be a two two two we know that it's going to be a voice and that voice is going to be in the bride and it already is in the bride we just got to get to that all right and and we're striving for that H let me read you what one more quote here look um can't remember who said this but it says nothing ever goes away until it teaches us what we need to know think about that nothing ever goes away until it teach teaches us what we need to know because listen we're Christians and we're Progressive right not Progressive like the world we're Progressive in God that he's always moving and if God's always moving we better get in there with him all right and and these trials we don't stop at trials we go through trials we go through them when we go through them the test it becomes a testimony at the end and then the scars that we have they do not compare with the scars he took for me and you that's right no he physically was nailed to a cross you and I have not had that happen yet but we do need to Bear our cross as Christians and pick up the cross and follow him so God bless you uh brother um Aaron will be speaking for us Wednesday night remember next week end Friday Saturday and Sunday 73 and 9:45 we'll have a meal also remember April the 14th uh will be one service and then after the first service need all the men to stay in the sanctuary but my lovely wife told me a few minutes ago she said that a way to a man's heart is to his stomach so y'all go downstairs and eat first then come back up here on April the 14th and we we just have the men come up here and y'all will have a full stomach so instead of grumbling out of your mouth you gr I mean your stomach you can I I didn't say that right I'm sorry but that's not what it's going to be but really go ahead and eat something and then we'll come back up here at about 1:00 April the 14th that's a few weeks from now so uh if you're not like I said if you're not going to be here let me know and we'll run a copy off for you to listen to brother Joe we'll not put it online but we'll have it for just for the church okay uh we love you we love you with the love of the lord we love your soul flesh every once in a while I don't know but brother Dale's always said he said what he said I'm talking to your soul if you can ever get that soul to respond then he's got something to hold on to you can get happy in the flesh you can get all kind of feelings and emotions and that could be the devil but when God Burns that thing out of your soul and he comes and inhabits your soul you are changed for the rest of your life into eternity amen so that's what we want to do we want everybody if listen if Ephesus was a powerful Church everybody with me say Amen if e Ephesus was a powerful church it's only 12 but they were were 12 men that all had the Holy Ghost so now in the end time the Omega bride has to have a group of people I believe that's a powerful church and that includes sisters and brothers a powerful churches everybody with the Holy Ghost and all the problem no they may stay but well we won't have as many we'll know how to handle them all right I think that's what it was I don't think the early church just was they was on a you know bubble dance no they had their issues they had their problem they had their sons of ska they had their there Simon the the Tanner they had all these different ones that were you know they all were trying to combat the the early church and same we have the same here but listen we're Overcomers right through what through Christ that strengthens us all right so we just pray that uh uh we're praying for brother Aaron on Wednesday night and we appreciate these brothers uh doing the job that they do God's God's called us a good a gr group of people and I believe they're they're solid and we uh uh brother Dutch asked me last night he said I don't have nobody when I leave I have to call somebody in I said well you can't have none of mine I said he wanted him April the 14th and I said no I need to have him here on April the 14th but he's going to get somebody but it is pretty rough if you don't have a a minister brother Dale he he worked 8 to 10 hours a day led singing and preached every service they want to minister in here but colleag was one the first one really I think that that ministered a good bit that helped Dad out and uh we appreciate that cuz it really it's it's burdensome when you have to do it all by yourself you know and brother colie come in different ones um and helped out and we sure appreciate that brother colie L singing one time except for for a while didn't you buddy yep sure did you want to do it now okay he said I'll just do responsive reading okay just do responsive reading that'll be fine we appreciate all these all these Elders in the church amen listen they've been through a lot so if you need some wisdom talk to somebody who's been through it before don't talk to somebody who's not been through it before talk to somebody who's been through things before but um we appreciate you let's buy our heads and we'll get started with the church a next new church AE dear heavenly father I pray that you'd be with us sanctify us for this journey bless the ones that are sick bless the ones that are sin sick Lord call them to you father Lord In the Still of the Night Lord call their name and Lord may they call your name in Repentance and come to you father it's getting late late hour as we said before we don't we we're we're we're bumping up against time here and we're all getting older Lord and I pray that you just help us to do the things we need to do strengthen us keep us all well and strong we ask these in Jesus name amen Revelations one I was in the spirit on the Lord's day and heard behind me a great voice as of a trumpet saying I am Alpha and Omega the first and the last and what thou seest right in the book and send it into the seven churches which are in Asia Ephesus Smyrna we're getting ready to talk about Smyrna pergamus tharra Sardis Philadelphia Lea I turned to see the voice that spake to me and turning to see The Voice he saw seven golden candle sticks he saw something maybe he wasn't looking for but when he looked to see Jesus's voice he knew his voice he turned to look he saw a scene and that scene is the whole Gentile dispensation he saw every bit of it and that's me and you we're included in that we're included in this Vision I don't know if you know that or not we're included in this Vision you're standing in it today and the loudy in church J We're not in it we're we're not of it but we're in it and in the midst of the seven candlesticks one lik un to the son of man clothed with a garment down to the foot and G about to PS with a golden girdle he that had in his right hand Seven Stars and out of his mouth one a sharp two-edged sword that's the message now let's read and so the angel of the church in Smyrna write these things sayith the first and the last which are dead which was dead and is alive I Know Thy Works in Tribulation and poverty I look he didn't say I'll get you out of the right he did not say I'm going to spare you I'm going to get you out he says I Know Thy works I Know Thy tribulation I Know Thy poverty but Thou Art rich and I know the blasphemy of them which say they are Jews and are not but are the synagogues of Satan we know all Jews are not Jews right all Israel is not Israel fear none of those things which Thou shalt suffer behold the devil shall cast some of you into prison that you may be tried and you shall have tribulation in 10 days be thou faithful unto death and I will give thee a Crown of Life he that hath in near let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches he that overcometh shall not be hurt praise God of the second death you may be seing the Lord as his Blessing to the reading of the word as we've been saying before I want you to understand this this this whole um excuse me this whole message that we're on of the seven Church ages is complete and final revelation of Jesus Christ to the Gentiles we get nothing else we don't get the 144,000 message that's right we get the message that's given in this age through the mouth of God are this as we say the announcement in heaven it came out of the mind of God and if you don't know what that word logos is that word logos is speech in other words God is Elohim God's not even God until he created angels hello God is an object of worship God is not even a name right all right to be a God you have to have something to worship you so God was not God until he created something to worship him then he became God but he didn't want to stay God he wanted to talk and in order for him to talk so that we little PE brains can understand it it was called as the scholar say the logos or the speech or the word of God is coming forth in other words he's saying something that you and I can understand that's right amen I mean how can this guy that and I say guy cuz he's a man how can this guy that knew everything from from way back before he even created the world he knew every Gat and how many triple billion zillion gats there would be in this earth and brother Brown even goes closer he says and how many times a little na bad at his eye he knew that how you going to understand that guy you can't you can't even understand eternity cuz you know what you're going to look at you watch in a few minutes and say he sure has been going a while but time is what we have to live in some of us preachers step off into eternity every once in a while and preach a few hours but that's okay you can sit and watch a ball game for a couple hours out of the mind of God comes a logos so in other words it don't stay in his mind because remember if he thought it but never said anything it's not going to come to pass same way with you you even us as finite beings listen even us as finite beings we have thoughts in our mind and like brother Gary's walking in the door now but he somebody gives him a plan to build a house well if he looks at that and says that's a good plan then he turns around goes back home never go to the job site well it's in his mind it's a good plan it look like a really good house right somebody really did a good job with these plans but until he goes and says hey I need 2500 TOS logos I need this I'm instructing someone to bring me these things right then he goes I am the Builder I'm going to build this house according to these plans that's the way God is he built us come on and the solar system and everything we do he built it from his mind cuz he can't change he can't have a different thought like I said before don't ever say God don't love me no more if God ever loved you one time praise the go oh come on somebody if you just catch that if he ever loved you he can't un love you that's right he can't I don't even think he wants to he don't want to change his mind his mind's solid you know what so we can depend on our finite brain can Now understand a little piece of his infinite brain right that he's brought it down to me and you and this is the mind of God living out right here in front of everybody abely but it was sealed up at one time Paul's message was sealed up in God even when yeah all right I'm going to do it real quick so when God had this thought in the Old Testament now what did Brother R say he said that Moses he took Moses up into heaven right showed him the Tabernacle and how to build it but he showed him Jesus Christ which would be outter cour in cour holy of holy the pattern well Moses comes down what catches the mind of God comes down builds the Tabernacle but when he come over into the New Testament they said well God said sacrifice and offerings I would not I don't want no more of this it stinks you've made it a mockery but a body thou Hast prepared me now that Tabernacle that Moses saw that was a literal Tabernacle out of court inner Court holy of holies is now standing in front of you today you walked in with your Tabernacles whatever you got in your holy of holies it may be Unholy that's right but it can be holy right out of court you got Sun shine you got rain you got Gentiles coming in you got Gentiles going out you got animals being slain you got all this Blood and Guts everywhere but then you go back into the next compartment and you've got a Candlestick and You' got a little shoe bread but only a certain group can go back into there then then the high priest takes everything from there and goes into the holy of holies one man amen quietness when that curtain rocks could you imagine knowing that God's fixing to appear and you're the only one that's going to see him you have that in you right now right every day of your life if you're born again you have what Israel longed to see was they wanted to see that sh sure they could see the kind of they could see the cloud they could see the that the cloud dropped down into that holy of holies we got a picture of it back there where that cloud goes right down in the holy of holies they wanted to see who that was you are who that was what you got inside of you is the same thing that met Moses that met Aaron that met the different ones that went in the holy holies you possess that now that's why God wanted he didn't want that he wanted to prepare a body and he's prepared a body called a bride now but he stepped her through seven Church ages so the so that we can understand amen right like I said before you start studying irenius and I can see in just a very short period of time that I that I researched irenius what a great ministry he had what a what a separated Ministry he had well listen Paul was separated if Paul was separated irenius has got to be separated Martin's got to be separated Columbus got to be separated Luther's got to be separated West remember Luther was separated from the Catholic Church see brother R come out of Pentecost he didn't want nothing do with denominations he had to come out yeah so they're all separated so why me and you trying to stay in I don't mean I mean why do we try to go back the answer is not backwards the answer is [Music] forward that's why we were brother dut and I were talking last night and and I you see the deception of the devil because you take people's been in this message for 30 40 years preach the message preach the message and they walk away that's still got to be going through their mind but somewhere Satan has got that thing so callous until they don't even think about it anymore how in the world could you come from out from under the sh glory and go back into the filth you never got the sh of Glory in the first place is what it was so you make sure you got the Shak of Glory because remember the Bible says even the elect could be deceived but brother brandom thank God for a prophet he said no she will not that's right she will not be deceived why cuz she's got the one listen you'll be deceived if you got the deceiver inside you but if you got the revealer inside of you the deceiver is not there that's right so there's the one you hold on to that's that Anchor Holds and that's the The Bu land that we've been singing We Sing about all these things like that but when you start singing bu land it's like brother um Michael said he said don't you want to go there why you want to stay here I want to go there I want that to come here thank you listen this is truth this is truth there is no other truth in the world there's part truth Baptists have part truth B everybody's got part truth and like I said before God don't just talk to the bride he talks to a lot of people okay and and he anoints and inspires people but there's only one bride right one she don't have he don't have two wives he divorced Israel for what she did and he married a bride and he's not going to divorce us because that's why he divorced her because she went whing and we're not going to we're the Bride of Jesus Christ The Virtuous sinless bride of Jesus Christ you said oh I sin every day yes you do but God through that filter of grace and mercy can't see it he hears your voice God I didn't mean to do that amen God I didn't mean to do that I am so sorry and he know where whether you're sorry or not cuz there's a difference in getting being sorry cuz you got caught come on somebody and being really sorrowful Godly sorrow the Bible says leads what leads to repentance Godly sorrow leads to repentance all right I don't know why I got on that but that won't charge I won't charge anything for that so a mystery is unfolded in other words it comes out of the mind of God the reason I'm going over this this is so miraculous God did this God did it not not not somebody that that might be true not somebody that might have it right this guy was right from the beginning yes sir and he's trying to give us a piece at a time cuz we can't take it all at one time we go crazy so he gives it to us first church age then he gives to Second Church age and then here we are though in Lea where much is given much is required we're required to see all that to be be able to see how God moves up to your day right here and we'll read it in just a few minutes what brother R says he brother R even says the evil that was in the first church age lapped itself over in every Church age and came right down to this age right here so we didn't leave the evil we didn't leave it down in that first church age no if it was in the first church age it's going to be in this one Grievous wolves Grievous wolves falling away from the Faith Falling Away from the faith same thing so a mystery is unfolded to the star of the age which is one messenger One messenger to each age not four five not 15 or 20 that's right one and that piece matches exactly what God saw and when it did boom then there you have eternity the logos Paul was not Paul was so much a prisoner he said I'm not of my own self I need I got to have the mind of Christ right he tells you you got to have the mind of Christ amen and the way it's called heresy do I serve this God crazy every once in a while it's not bad to go crazy stay that way might have a problem but it doesn't hurt but every once in a while get a little crazy and that's all right if you want to run the aisle go ahead if you want to shout if you want to praise the Lord you'll go right ahead as long as of God it'll get you somewhere like that old guy said that the guy was running the aisles and he run over the you know he was in Pentecost and he was running through the he run over the bench and fell and broke his leg and he said he did it for the glory of God and that old man said God wasn't in that or you wouldn't have broke your leg okie dokie then thank God for people that can tell the truth so a trumpet sound so a message is brought Paul brings a message we going look see irenius is fixing to bring a message but it's look it's a distinct and declared message is for that age this age and all the other ages so it starts a spiritual war the true word versus the false Doctrine cuz false Doctrine listen who was true first God then Satan comes in and perverts always Satan is not an originator of anything except sin I got it but he takes what God he takes the true and makes false out of it so the true word had to strike the Earth and then the false word come right behind it all right everybody with me so that's going to be all the way through all even in this age amen remember brother Ram come out and he had he had the signs and the Wonders and then they started doing the oil in the hands and doing and they were hitting and missing every once in a while that wasn't a God that was an imitation we don't want imitation we want the truth right so then the messengers is laid away or taken off the Earth as we were um talking about the other day he didn't let Paul continue on he didn't let brother random continue on cuzz everybody looking at the messenger looking at the messenger looking at the messenger you better be looking at Jesus Christ your messenger that's right now he uses a voice he uses a distinct person to bring that message but it's God if it's logos then it's got to be logos now all right so look people will accept it or reject it as we were talking about free will this morning it brings a temporary judgment or a plague what the ones that turn it down get a plague the ones that receive it we get a blessing he that overcometh you know they had one thing to overcome you know we in this age we have all those things to overcome but listen God equipped us to do it that's right amen he knew we'd be here there's listen there is no time God said oops I didn't mean to do that everything he has is a purpose for you and me not for him he's Eternal he need me he don't need air to breathe he don't need an earth to stand on but he wants you cuz you were in his mind you were very part of him and he wants to express you in this time of the darkest most evil time that ever was is right here today amen and you're sitting in it and tomorrow you're going to go into Monday which is the devil day anyway especially at the post office I don't know about y'all but uh God's still there amen God's still working he don't he don't take vacations praise God so the next stage comes there's another announcement then out of the mind of God comes the second part or a sealed up message comes and and irenius is I I'm sure listen that's what surprises me because Paul I don't think Paul ever sit in his study one day or prison he spent a lot of time in jail Paul Paul spent a lot of time in jail he was a prisoner but he was a prisoner to Christ he wasn't a prisoner to to them cuz they let him go wherever he wanted to but I don't think Paul sat there and was writing and and he was writing to the Corinthians and different ones and I don't think at that point in time he said I'm writing the Bible no he was writing to the Corinthians because they were doing some bad stuff he was writing to the Thessalonians he was writing to Timothy telling him some things he needed to do but it developed into it was the whole time it was God working and Paul why am I saying this cuz whatever happened then is got to happen now I don't think Paul ever said now now I think I'm the first church CH messenger he probably didn't even know nothing about see remember he died before John went to patmas and had this Vision now God may have revealed stuff to Paul different things but I don't think he said well now I'm Church agent number one and irenius is coming that was left to me and you and the end time that was left that the book will be open yes they would be able to see from cover to cover there you go Paul said I look to a glass Darkly he could see something coming but he just didn't know what it was but we praise God that he's give us time in the end time time in the end time to pick these things up and say man there was Paul the Great Mighty Paul wrote 80% of the Bible they actually call it a Paul Indian Bible in different places so he wrote 80% of the the New Testament not the Old Testament but New Testament and then here we got irenius and we see in a few minutes his powerful powerful message that irus uh brought and he still held on to one God and he still had on to held on to water baptism the name of Jesus Christ because he was under that lion age of the combat Beast the lion ox man and Eagle the lion age was the first three Church ages one two and three so we're in the second Church age but they were bold where have we lost our boldness we have lost it that don't mean to be arrogant there's a difference in arrogant and bold am okay so remember that everything started with the age of Pentecost we'll look at it in just a minute on the chart the messenger was the Holy Ghost then the alpha age started or the Ephesian Church age started about ad 53 and then Paul died around 64 to 67 ad they don't know exactly what year they didn't keep really good records back then from 64 to 67 he was killed because that's the time that Nero was was on U Throne whatever he was there in Rome so the Ephesian Church age though ended around ad 170 so Paul left the scene in 64 65 66 and then it went on another what 150 years almost or 50 years almost well more than that that somebody had to pick that message up and sweep it to irenius but what happened was the original messenger was gone only a certain group of people picked that up and carried it what happened was the Grievous wolves took it in this direction the false teaching took it in this direction cuz we're going to see here as we go through the church ages that was 170 ad well now 325 ad is when they had the U um Nan Council there in N Rome and that's when everything started turning into into into just mush they took everything out of the Bible and put it on a pope all right but we'll see that in just a little bit so the Ephesian Church AG ended around 8170 but what happened is is we're going to see this chart and I'm going to read you the Bible um if you look at that chart you see Pentecost this is all your seven Church ages there's your stars Paul irus Martin Columba Luther Wesley and then you got the Holy Ghost like it was over here and then you got the Elijah of the end time which carries us over into eternity all right we'll explain that in just a little bit maybe not today but you got Paul you see that blue over there it says Paul I don't know if you can see it in the very back but it says Porters what happened now on in Pentecost Paul was not the spokesman of Pentecost the Holy Ghost was the spokesman of Pentecost all right but then Paul comes along in ad 53 and establish a church in Ephesus starts bringing his message so brother R makes an outstanding statement we're reading here in just a few minutes he said each messenger comes at the end of the age well now look if Paul listen if this was the first age everybody with me this is the first age if Paul came at the end of the first age he'd have come right here and he' have missed his whole everybody over here but Paul came at the end of Pentecost of ad30 to ad 53 or 56 Paul brings his message and he brings a message dies the message carries on but then it starts going down but there's an overlap here or an open door where it laps over literally these things right here should be everybody seen the uh what is it the Olympic rings how they're all connected these should all be connected right because they don't abruptly end and another one began everybody with me this is chart was made where you can see it's Church individually but this church age lapped over in this overlap where a porter comes in that we were talking about this morning we'll read the scripture there in uh I believe it was in John but then Paul comes at the end of the Pentecostal age brings his message then irenius comes at the end of the age he doesn't come at the end of his age he comes at the end of Paul's age which is Ephesus he comes in and brings the message to Smyrna so now let's I'll pull it up on this screen you don't have to you don't have to go to it brother Rob said look now each Church age had its messenger we know that Paul was a first messenger and when the first trumpet sounded the first seal tore loose Paul was the first Messenger as we found what did he do declared a war on the Orthodox Church for not believing the Messiah sign that Jesus had produced to them while they should have known it they should have known him remember Paul come at the End of the Age so what age did he come at the end of end of Pentecost all right from 8030 to 8050 something he comes at the end of that age that Pentecostal age all the messengers come at the end of the age it's at the end time when these things are brought forth so the end time is when it ends it all up all right everybody with me let's go to John 10 let's read about this Porter ver verely I say unto you he that entereth not by the door now who is the door the door is Jesus Christ it's not another man that's right it's Jesus Christ I am the door he said I am the way the truth and the life yes so the Porter is not the door the Porter is the introducer to the door everybody with me but he's got to have the mind of what the door is and what's behind it for him to be a porter right in other words pick up the mind of God the logos and tell you what's in there in that as we were talking the rich Caron or wherever you want to go to a motel but if you don't come in by the door if you climb in some other way you're a thief and a robber but he that entereth in by the door is The Shepherd of the sheep now entereth entereth in by the door is The Shepherd of the sheep you got to realize one thing sheep need a shepherd and as a Shepherd being the pastor of the church you're the shepherd but listen we got a chief Shepherd amen we got a Shepherd that we all got to look to and which is the door Jesus Christ if we keep him the center of everything we are good do not ever put something in front of him that's right so if you'll keep it that way and keep your line up then everything's fine that's why people couldn't keep it they couldn't see brother brandom as a porter they saw him as a door hello they saw him as God he's not God he's a porter to introduce you to the door but he that ENT by the door is The Shepherd of the sheep to him the porter openeth all right look to him in other words who's coming in the porter openeth so there's an open door between each age and we'll look at it in just a second and look and the sheep hear his voice now remember I like what brother Brown says about a pastor you know a pastor lives with his people people and being beekeepers um we were talking about last night you can put 10 hives across that wall right there and you can put 10 different sets of of bee colonies and 10 different queens and this one right here won't fly into that one if he's supposed to be or she's supposed to be in this one why there's an odor their Queen gives off an odor different from the next one they go by smell sheep go by smell they don't know their Shepherd by name they're not humans right so you got to smell the same as your sheep I don't know where that came from cuz if you don't smell like if you don't smell like a sheep what's the Sheep going to do that ain't my shepherd right so you go by smell and literally we have had 10 hives and and there's no they call it drifting a little bit but 99% of those bees if she comes from this direction she's supposed to be over there she'll fly straight over there them other bees are going to go to their High because of the odor that the queen gives off this different or pheromone that she gives off that's different than the rest of them so same way with the Sheep the shepherd lives so much with the Sheep he smoks like the Sheep we'll stop on that right there to him to him the Porter openeth and the sheep hear his voice and he C look he calleth his own Sheep by name all right and leadth them out and when he put forth his own sheep he goes before them and the Sheep follow for they know his voice and a stranger will they not follow but will flee from him for they know not the voice of strangers wow my sheep hear my voice amen now the Greek lexican tells us that that word Porter which is Thor Roose which is through it's also a watcher or one that keeps the door he's not the door he's The Keeper of the door everybody with me he's not the door he's The Keeper of the door but he knows what's behind the door God has give him the uh um give him the mind to know what's behind that door all right if you take a porter that's never been in a rich Colton and you put him in front of the rich Colton he's a porter but he don't know what's behind that door CU he had listen to that part of what the shepherd to know what's behind it so you got to be at the right place at the right time all right put the right Porter in the right place and he'll tell you about the door so let's look right here and see again that Paul comes at the end of the age of Pentecost which there's a lap over time then when Paul is finished and his message is starting to dwindle brother Brown says his message starts to in other words what there's divisions factions everything starts listen the only person that likes to divide and conquer is who the devil all right God doesn't stick together so that Porter comes then at the end of the Ephesus or Ephesian Church age irenius comes on the scene at that period of time and he brings a message all right but there's also some lap over between Paul and irenius and I'll show you here in just a minute that lap over as we were talking this morning to me that equals grace of God to not just say abruptly all right you've heard brother brand I see you can't hear him no more you either take it leave it or done no there's a lap over time a lot of those Pentecostals were still Pentecostals when brother ROM was preaching amen they were still Pentecostal after he got finished preaching but there was praise God there was somebody heard the right voice they heard the right voice and they said oh he's not the door but he's the one that's going to introduce us to the door we're going into the right place at the right time amen that's right only the hand of God can do that how'd he call you how'd you get here some of you have heard other voices some of you may be hearing voices now and I'm not talking about the ministry here I'm talking about the message of the hour yes when God called a group of people you had to respond that's right if there was nothing in you to respond you ain't going to respond and we know one thing for sure there was nothing in us that was eternal it was the thoughts of God that come looking for me and you amen knowing we would accept it and when we did would give us a new yes birth the seeds the word of God you had to hear the word of God not only hear it you had to accept it that's right abely I heard the word of God for 20 years every once in a while right we come on Christmas and Easter Mother's Day every once in a while and I heard a preaching but it went but there was one time when it was my time he called and I answer same way with you there's a time God called and you answer and you heard that Porter tell you here's the door come here's the way and what's behind that is what Holiness yes sanctification what's behind that is a clean living yes what's behind that is no letter to get in the church what behind that door is how to get baptized how to live right how to talk how to go to church how to do the things of God inside of there not outside here not in the outer Court sir people going up down the street never even pay attention to that building but somehow you got to that building and you said yes amen okay tell me what this building's about I see this door This Man Called Jesus I've heard of this over here I've heard of this over here I've heard of super eight I've heard of um what's one to leave the light on Red Roof in or whatever Tom bodette I knew I'd get you to laugh sometime before you laugh I knew you would but Tom bad don't have the light that's left on the message of the hour is what's got the light the on but we went to these different motels we went to these different places but there was one time we go walking down the road and something goes stopah he said stop and you stop millions of others just walked right on by and he may have said stop and they didn't pay him any attention oh we don't want to do that we heard what's behind that building you got to live right we we'll go over here to this super a where you don't have to live why am I using Motel where you well you don't have to live right over here sister you praise God in life all you want to you're good you're good good to have you with us good spirit about you appreciate you but it's it's not an example it's the truth millions of people go rushing up and down life and never even look right God's got him like where's where's Louise Netflix that's true he says you don't have an account but I'm going to talk to him about that I'll talk to him before he gets back but we did There's billions of people go up and down the road of life and never even pay attention and here's a man standing at a door the door's here that door is Jesus Christ they stand right here and this man is compelling them remember the the Bible says go into the highways and compel them to come in in other words now the Porter's out in the middle of the road he's saying come in I don't care come in come as you are but you're not going to leave as you are if you really get something everybody all right I really didn't mean to use the motel but that's really what it is I mean the porter stands at the door right and you've seen I've seen them in the movies you've seen them they stand there with a really nice coat and they they're presentable so anybody can walk up to them that wants to but do you really want to know oh I heard about that I heard about that that religion them cult people them cult people they follow a man everybody follows a man my God Jim Jones got 500 people to kill herself don't drink the Kool-Aid but can you imagine he duped 500 people into commit murder willfully why can't we get God to lead us into the truth if he can lead that group of people into killing theirself because of religion listen it he was a religious man he was in brother R's meetings you'all know that Jim Jones was in brother R's meetings yes he was he sure was but you see what he done he took his own twist and took the people off and they all died that's right but how many people spiritually died since they turned the message down it wouldn't go through that door cuz you know what that door is not so illustrious it's not so beautiful the Bible said there's no beauty that we should desire him he's standing there little short guy he's got a crown of thorns on his head brother but he's the most beautiful thing you'll ever see in your life if you become a Christian amen that's the most beautiful thing you'll ever see in your entire life if you look at those nail scar hands and know he did it for you but you had to have somebody tell you about him I didn't do it that way God set it up that way God set it up that you would hear seven Church age Messengers the people of those ages depended on irenius to bring them a message the people of Martin when irenius passed on we'll look at in a minute irenius actually passed on the same time about in the middle of the age we'll see up when we get to Columba he died before the age even started but his message amen it's the message that carries this thing on not the person amen it's the message the voice it's looking at looking sometimes you got to look past the porter he may be not the best looking thing in the world but he's your Porter he's your introducer to what's behind the door and that's what these Church ages are listen brother B says that the seals there was a seal there's a seal over that door but see he wants you to go through that door well he breaks the seal back and says hey come on in come on in come on in and enjoy enjoy Christianity don't make it a drudgery enjoy Christianity enjoy going through trials you know we hate to we not get up in the morning and go what's next but we should get up in the morning and go what's next I got to quit hauling I'm gonna get one of them things like Andrew's got sticks in his ear where he talk like this all the time but gets excited I'm 64 but but there was an open door or an overlap that went from Paul's age to aras's age all right so now let's watch let's read this everybody with me I you're not asleep today boy nobody's going to sleep praise the Lord I'm going to I'm going to pull this out I told him the other day you know with Dad um we have to kind of follow him around during the day and to get my sermons this sometimes this is way I have to get them careful Dad don't get on there or either I got my tablet out and I'm looking up some quotes you know during that time but you know what praise God it works oh oh I unplugged that sorry I hope I didn't mess it up help I need a porter thank you all right let's let's read this let's look at this real quick everybody okay all right it's hot up here the Philadelphian Church age 1960 brother R said look now there's one of the Striking things though keep bearing in your mind that these Church ages start and whatever is in that one Church age it goes all the way through every Church age and each one of the church ages lap over one another now if you don't know what a lap over is Brother Gary does because you build stairs all right stairs are not hung out in the middle of space you started a base right you put a board up you lap over this board then from the on this board you lap another board you don't put it on the side you put it right on top of it right brother Gary put it right on top of it pretty much CU what it supports itself there's a support going all the way up and that's what this is this is a lap over you've lapped over the stairs so that you can get to another church age brother I'm going explain it in a minute and each of the church ages laps over another if you study the history Clos close with the book you'll find out it's like laps like this laying over each other and one Church age is going out the angel that comes in between there right well get back to my now what the Angel's going to do I'm going to read the quote but I'll I'll ver not verba him but what happens is this messenger picks up the mind of God the logos of God but what does he do he rebukes these back here from falling away he understands that there's something going on that the people are getting cold and Irene says they're getting cold I'm going to begin to proclaim a message that brings them out of that in the overlap and then brings this group of people in listen it must be perfect cuz God God's W done that we didn't all right amen so now one Church age's going out the angel comes in between there it's to call back that church to Faith that it once lost it's always been that and I didn't realize this I'm I'm pretty smart guy but I didn't realize this right here took a prophet did you know where the book of Jude is placed in the right place in the Bible watch what brother Brown says look at Jude the last book in the Bible in other words before Revelation till you hit the Revelation there Jude Jude said I write unto you wrote unto you that you might earnestly contend for the faith that was once delivered to the Saints the lapping over between the apostles H Corinthians Hebrews Timothy all those right Jude comes on the scene and writes a lap over to lap lap us into the Book of Revelations thank God for a prophet and he's telling them declaring them to earnestly contend for the faith that was once delivered to the Saints in other words back here now watch what brother Brown said the lapping over between the apostles and the coming of the Revelation because most of the apostles were dead see they were gone on there was only one living and that's John and he's going to be the porter or the one that's going to bring us into the Book of Revelations he's the one that Jesus was talking about he said some of you won't die until you see my coming where did he see his coming at chapter one I turned and looked and saw seven oh Hallelujah seven golden candlesticks and there's a bride and John's like waa that that's what he meant that's what he meant he's coming back in the bride cuz there one thing for sure John had the Holy Ghost and the Holy Ghost wrote the word had to correspond with the Holy Ghost that was in John and that's why John in Revelations 5 screamed out and everybody heard him we ought to try that sometime when you see your name on the book you ought to start screaming and Shout cuz there's a lot of people don't have their name on a book oh they have it on a book book of life but I'm looking at the Lamb's Book of Life The Eternal section the part that God put totally aside no one can touch it that's right cuz remember in the other parts you can have your name erased cuz Judas was in The Book of Life he was in the Lamb's Book of Life but not the Eternal station brother R said his name was marked out he was given a chance in other words he was G there's not a great big book up there come on people when we go to the white Throne judgment there not going to be dust go everywhere it ain't going to be James klie cuz he ain't going to be there he's going to be standing back here but so and so and so and so no ain't going to be that where is your book written today right here in your actions that's what the old phrase say sister tell me I can read you like a is she a book am I a book no I'm not book but I am the book I'm the book it's written the Bible says written Epistles known and read of all men so Hallelujah you're looking at the book and I'm looking at the book and if you got eternal life today I'm looking at the Eternal section never can be taken out you'll never sin enough to be taken out cuz you know what if your name's in there like that you won't sin like that pretty simple the lapping over between the apostles and the coming of the Revelation because most apostles were dead then see was gone on one living at that time that was St John the Divine which is the Revelator or writer that got the Revelation from the angel of the Lord to write the Book of Revelations remember he didn't get it from an angel he got it from Jesus Christ the angel if you read your Bible look at the Book of Revelations there's a lot of red letters in there that usually constitutes that Jesus is talking thank now you see they laap over one another so now I guess you've noticed that and picked it up coming down as I've been mentioning it how that here in the Sardis age he's talking about the Sardis age that was the marriage age actually the church never really come into full existence until thyra but he got married in Sardis Sardis means being a marriage now we'll read this later on cuz I I'll explain what he just said there is an explanation for that the church Ain started in Ephesus but I know what he's talking about and I'll break it down for you when we get to the sardian church age now if you notice it married here and then lapped over into that age there and you notice Luther last night come out with a dead name a name of dead and then Escape one see it had the dead Church from back here the escaping of the little Remnant that was brought out in this age here we'll get to that later then tomorrow night when it goes out just at the end now watch notice the angel appears right at the end time just at the end time to rebuke the church now who did Brother brandham rebuke the Pentecostals more than any body he rebuked them for falling away from their first love he really didn't do much I mean he called out Baptist in different once but he was in that Pentecostal rank he said you Pentecostals he said you you shouted it out he said you stopped God's moved on could you imagine being a staunch Pentecostal that's why they didn't want to hear him later on right right yeah the angel appears right at the end time just at the end time to rebuke the church for it losing its first love and how it got away from God like they did down through there the ages same time the messenger thing same thing the messenger does tonight the angel messenger comes back to rebuke them each age like that for what they had done so that makes a lap over in one in each of the church ages just lap right over one another like that like climbing up a step it's laying in laps like that in other words like this all right L say in church age Paul comes at the end of the age and on down End of the Age the lap over the lap part that's when the angel comes that's when the messenger comes at the end of the age and the lap over as we were showing in the chart end of the age that what M that's what makes it lap see to the angel speaking what was this laps over here to the angel at the end of that age see picking up right here made the lap like stair steps going up the seven Church agents now listen watch this right here every evil that was in that first church lapped over into the next one in other words we didn't leave him back under he came right on up and he lapped over too he sent his Porter and his messenger just kept going on down until finally it ends up in complete in complete apostasy in the last age every evil just keeps lapping over in each church every little ISM that started out like in Genesis Divine started growing it weaved its way through the church and comes out in the last days no wonder the Bible said blessed are they that escape in that day yes sir that escapes all these things and here's where I wrote I wrote look the lap over equals Grace it was the grace of God that the people in Paul's age were getting so lacked and so laxidasical they they quit going to church all the time and and it sound like now get laxidasical you you well there's they probably ain't nothing you know brother Wade's probably going to preach for a couple hours and we're going to have to sit there and man if I shut my eyes he's going to scream at me well if you wouldn't shut your eyes I wouldn't scream at you kind of takes care of that but uh you know brother brandham he raised his voice too remember the bride got out of Step he said I woke up from the dream with my hands out like this saying get in line amen right amen right so if the prophet messenger can say get in line we should be able to say get in line most of our problems are originate by not being in line then like I said before then you trying to you want this magic fairy or you want this magic prayer to be prayed or you want this this magic switch to be flipped come on there is one it's called you it's called doing what God said if you sit down I promise you you sit down your chair when you go home and I'm going to quit right here you sit down magicians come on y'all don't sit down come on you sit down in your chair if I say sit down if I don't finish this I'm going to forget it you going to sit down at your house today and I want you to do that just for about 5 minutes sit down somewhere and say God am I doing everything I'm supposed to do to progress further with you just just give yourself five minutes do I have ought against my brother do I have all against my sister am I not going to church because I don't like the person sitting beside me I'm just standing over here I I wasn't condemning I was just standing here I thought maybe he didn't hear me Susan said I like you brother collie did not say anything back I like her you like her too okay but let's be honest sometimes like we said before sometimes we want that magic pill we want that quick get rich quick scheme but remember Christianity it's not a microwave it's a Crockpot a very slow crockpot you know when you turn it on low it takes all day to cook in beans but boy at the end of the day and beans are good so you ask yourself today let's all stand you ask yourself today am I doing every thing I need to do for God to move in my life if you say well I can't I can't I can't I can't I can't can't quit this and I can't quit that I can't all right it starts with you amen remember I said the other day the Bible says that little small scripture says resist the devil and he'll flee from you now wait a minute I didn't say assist I said resist I like that song the things I used to do you know have seeing it I do them no more why I'm a different person I've Been Changed we're looking for a change it started the day God entered your soul AB you started your change of your body cuz it starts from the inside it's not going to be some switch you flip it's going to be when the inside guy takes over the outside guy sometimes we let the outside guy take over the inside guy because of the sin that's all the way around us and the things we know we shouldn't do we do them anyway that's called iniquity so don't blame the preacher don't blame the deacons look in the mirror blame that person I told my daughter one time she was saying she she does this because of this I said well let me tell you something I wasn't there to pour that alcohol in you I wasn't there and shoved them pills down your throat I said you took them in your hand and you put them in your mouth you open the bottle and you drank it nobody forced you you did it on your own you did it yourself now there are times when I understand you're forced to do things but no not like what I'm talking about no you can't blame nobody you can't blame nobody but yourself well I you started with the right word I listen we're all here to help but we can't help one person that don't want help you cannot help somebody that don't want help you know what brother Ram said when when brother Ram was standing in a line he cast a demon out of a sister right a few days later he's telling the story he said a few days later the minister comes back and said brother r that woman was doing the same thing she was doing she's got that devil back on her he said she liked it so it came back on her so whose fault was it it was hers she liked it sometimes we like Misery we like sorry but we do we're human beings but we got to be transformed amen turned around right by the renewing of the mind that we had before we are renewing the new you old things are passed away behold All Things become new you say well no that's when I get a body change you better start now you better start now you better get Soul cleaned up hallu don't worry about your sister don't worry about your brother don't worry about well Julie got wrong so I'm going to I'm going to I ain't stay I ain't going to church I'm just going to start taking pills cuz Julie got wrong by her sister she knows that's not true but we make those excuses no get yourself right that's right brother look in the mirror and say it's your fault and get you a big one not one of them round ones get you big big old mirror one of them you need a real big one get one of them real big mirrors and stand in front of them and say you're my problem right remember what I read you you cannot control what goes on out here but you can control what goes on in here you're God's you can change a situation by your testimony by the word of your mouth you can change things by your words you'll be what Justified and by your words you shall be condemned that's what he and it's a it's a word of God so it can't change by your words he didn't say by the preachers words and say by the drum player's Words which is the Deacon I like that shirt but it's by your words God's going to God's not going to listen when you go to the white Throne judgment if you have to pray God nobody has to you go to the white Throne judgment then ain't you in a group of people that's right it ain't you and your friends well they may where are they oh they're in line they got to tell their own story right you'll stand up there by yourself and give an account of what they done no count what you done let's sing a song God bless you I love these Church ages I like to see the way God developed but he

now oh how I love him how I adore him my My Sunshine My All In All oh the great Creator became my savior all God's fullness dwelling my breath My Sunshine there's probably I don't know how many people die in a day but there's probably 25 or 30,000 people around the world die that's not going to live past today their last breath is going to be drawn on this side and if they ain't made a decision yes as the tree falls at the tree leans that's how it's going to fall we're not guaranteed one breath that's right not not even one yet every day we just breathe in and out it's just an automatic process your body breathes out your cells do the work it gets rid of the carbon dioxide it brings the oxygen in you got all the impurities that go in and out you eat and all the different things and you're and people spit in God's face oh how I love him he created your body gave you life now what are you doing with it what are you doing with it what are you doing with this gospel that all those people down through those Church ages we know there's one thing for sure during the Dark Ages there was 68 million Christians killed that's on books that's not just saying well I think it might have been no in the martyrology you read Fox's book of Martyrs Catholic Church put it out they killed 68 8 million people for being Christians and turning the Catholic Church down and we have a bad day and we go crawling under the sheets and say oh God I'm so you've left me he said I'll never never what oh never leave you nor forsake you like I said before he can't turn against you if he loved you from the beginning he's going to love you all the way the body change and he's going to love you I I just before we go I I had a a friend of ours uh past away not too long ago and he was a very good very good person he wasn't a Believer but he was so good to the family so good to us and different things and you know we always wonder why does why does he was probably you know 40 something years old 45 years old why does God take somebody like that well if he's going to be given eternal life because of you one day God did him a favor he ain't got to worry about nothing else to the white Throne he ain't got to worry about bills he ain't got to worry about getting sick again he's not going have to worry about going through that awful tribulation that's coming God has took him and preserved him let me give you a little secret he preserved them for you he preserved them for you that's how much he thinks about me and you even the people that we associate with is good to me and you the Bible says a couple water in my name will not be forgotten here or there so we've seen people that's been in our in our families and different things been really good friends and you wonder why Lord did he did them a favor he took them out of all this and he's got them preserved in a place and they're standing there waiting and it's the white Throne judgment God knows they going to get eternal life because of you and what you represent boy don't ever listen folks don't ever sell ourselves short that's right we're the Bride of Jesus Christ we're not arrogant and we're not but we can be boastful about what the Bible says we can boast in what God's done for us we can boast that we are in this Bible and God's going to take care of us brother John he's going to take care of us he's going to take care of our family he going to take care but remember go home for about 10 minutes and just sit down and said look God am I doing everything I need to do cuz remember brother random said look he said when you've done everything you know to do what' he say run off quit Church don't do he said stand right there stand right there and he said see the salvation of the Lord ain't that what Moses told him when is at the Red Sea he told Moses he said you tell them he said you tell them stand right there don't go running off now if any went running all over the place God had never produced what he produced that great miracle the part in the sea but he said tell them to stand still and see the salvation of the Lord I'm telling you today stand still yes on whatever you got going on in your life you stand right there and say God now listen he knows if you've done everything you need to do so don't tell him say God I've done everything I need to do he'll probably remind you about some of the
