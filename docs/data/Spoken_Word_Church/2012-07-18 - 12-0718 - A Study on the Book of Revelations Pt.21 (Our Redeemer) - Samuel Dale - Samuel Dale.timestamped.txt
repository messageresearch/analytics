[4:01] else? Remember to pray one for another
[4:05] continually because we always need each
[4:07] other's prayer. All right. Revelations
[4:11] 1 Peter 1.
[4:13] Heavenly Father, we thank you for this
[4:15] day in your light and love that you've
[4:17] allowed to shine in our path that we may
[4:20] be able to see you. We pray that you
[4:22] would just have your way with each and
[4:24] every one of us. And Lord, most of all,
[4:27] that you'd forgive our sins, cover us by
[4:29] the blood, and Lord, that we may be able
[4:32] to walk in you. And as we try to speak
[4:35] about you tonight, Lord, you come on the
[4:36] scene in each one of our hearts and our
[4:39] lives and manifest yourself in a mighty
[4:41] way to bring forth your word unto us
[4:45] because we know and we've read many
[4:47] times. We can open the book but and we
[4:50] can speak about it but yet we cannot
[4:53] reveal it. So then it'll take you among
[4:56] us to do the work. So come tonight and
[4:58] and just manifest yourself each one of
[5:00] our hearts and lives. Remember these
[5:02] that are the ones that are not here, the
[5:04] sicknesses and things. Little Mark
[5:06] there. Remember him, Father. And just
[5:08] remember Brother Ryan's family there in
[5:10] the loss of the loved one. And just have
[5:13] your way with each and every one of us.
[5:15] Guide us now in Jesus' name we pray.
[5:19] Amen. Amen.
[5:21] Revelations
[5:23] 1
[5:25] 1-3. the revelation of Jesus Christ,
[5:29] which God gave unto him, to show unto
[5:32] his servants things which must shortly
[5:34] come to pass. And he sent and signified
[5:36] it by his angel unto his servant John,
[5:39] who bear record of the word of God, and
[5:41] of the testimony of Jesus Christ, and of
[5:43] all things that he saw. Blessed is he
[5:45] that readeth, and they that hear the
[5:47] words of this prophecy, and keep those
[5:49] things which are written therein, for
[5:52] the time is at hand. and what the time
[5:55] to understand
[5:57] should be surely at hand. Okay. 1 Peter
[6:00] 1:9.
[6:03] receiving the end of your faith, even
[6:04] the salvation of your souls, of which
[6:07] salvation the prophets have inquired,
[6:09] and search diligently, who prophesied of
[6:12] the grace that should come unto them,
[6:15] searching what or what manner of time
[6:17] the spirit of Christ, which was in them
[6:19] did signify, when it testified
[6:22] beforehand the sufferings of Christ, and
[6:24] the glory that should follow, unto whom
[6:27] it was revealed that unto that not unto
[6:30] themselves, but unto us they did
[6:32] minister these things which are now
[6:34] reported unto you by them that have
[6:36] preached the gospel unto you with the
[6:39] Holy Ghost sent down from heaven which
[6:42] things the angels desire to look in
[6:44] truth. Now what are we to do with all of
[6:47] that? Wherefore g up the loins of your
[6:48] mind be sober and hope to the end for
[6:51] the grace that is be to be brought to
[6:53] you at the revelation of Jesus Christ.
[6:57] You may be seated. The Lord add his
[6:59] blessing to the reading of the word.
[7:03] speaking from the book of Revelations
[7:05] and we've been trying to uh cover some
[7:09] things on it and just moving slowly as
[7:12] we gradually uh walk through the word
[7:15] and we've come through a point now to to
[7:18] be able to understand
[7:21] and and we we've looked at the
[7:24] book and we thank God that there was a
[7:28] prophet to bring the message because
[7:30] without him we would not have
[7:32] understanding of these things, right?
[7:34] But by his speaking the things of God
[7:38] and you know it's brought to our
[7:41] understanding at least a knowledge of
[7:43] the um you know what the symbols are the
[7:46] the things that are written in the book
[7:48] of revelations. So we can you know we
[7:51] can understand that and and follow into
[7:54] that line. All right. Now, you remember
[7:57] when we there and we'll read it in just
[8:00] a few minutes there in Revelations 5
[8:03] that it starts off by saying that there
[8:05] was
[8:07] a a throne, you know, one sitting on the
[8:11] throne. Now, that's chapter 4 about the
[8:14] throne. And in chapter 5, it comes forth
[8:16] and says, "And the book in the right
[8:18] hand of the one that was sitting on the
[8:19] throne." So we went through these things
[8:21] to try to cover them and without
[8:23] spending a lot of time to be able to um
[8:27] understand but yet to move on Brandon
[8:30] says paragraph 116 of the the seal book
[8:33] the breach that the book in the hand of
[8:37] the one on the throne was the book of
[8:40] redemption. Amen. And when Adam and Eve
[8:43] failed see then the book back went back
[8:45] to the original owner. Amen. which was
[8:48] almighty God himself. All right. And see
[8:51] then it would he would have it thou
[8:52] sitting on the throne in his hand. All
[8:54] right. Then we covered how that it was a
[8:58] sealed
[9:00] book. That was what we didn't
[9:02] understand. That was the one of the
[9:04] things in man's mind of trying to
[9:06] comprehend a sealed book when you can
[9:09] read it, right? You know, you say,
[9:12] "Well, how is it sealed when I can read
[9:14] it?" I I now can tell you especially the
[9:17] the the symbols and things cuz the
[9:20] prophet has brought it unto us. But
[9:23] until it's revealed to you and I, the
[9:25] book is still sealed. That's the point
[9:27] I've been trying to drive. All right?
[9:29] And you'll see in a minute why we spend
[9:31] so much time on that because, you know,
[9:33] we get over to the to the the dealing in
[9:36] the scripture there in Revelations. And
[9:39] we we we you know, we should at least be
[9:42] thinking a little bit
[9:44] about, well, why is all of this going
[9:47] this way when we know Calvary has
[9:49] already done
[9:51] this? You know, we know that Jesus
[9:54] Christ died for our sins
[9:57] at Calvary. He he purchased us and all,
[10:01] but yet still we we're coming to the
[10:04] book of Revelations and we find out it's
[10:06] a sealed book.
[10:08] Well, look like we would, you know,
[10:09] mankind would would really make light of
[10:12] us in our thinking. But it is sealed
[10:16] because if it wasn't sealed, why would
[10:18] the lamb be having to take the book and
[10:20] loose the seals, you know? I mean, what
[10:22] would be the the doings if it wasn't a
[10:24] sealed book? All right. So then we got
[10:27] to keep that in our mind that it was a
[10:28] sealed book. We covered that of how it
[10:31] was brought. And then brother Bradom
[10:32] covering how that the book is sealed.
[10:35] Page 75 of the the breach or paragraph
[10:38] 75. He covers that the book is sealed
[10:42] and you are sealed with the book.
[10:47] Now see then we better be considering
[10:49] what we're speaking about. As I said,
[10:52] we'd look at it and say, "Well, well,
[10:54] Jesus Christ done everything back
[10:55] there." Well, why would the book of
[10:57] Revelations be speaking of something
[11:00] seemingly in the end
[11:02] time? And then when we get over later to
[11:04] the lamb that was to take the book, it
[11:07] was a bloody lamb. Amen. We know where
[11:09] he he was crucified. But why would it be
[11:12] a bloody lamb to come over in the end
[11:14] time and have to do something, right?
[11:16] See, then there must be something about
[11:18] redemption that we don't fully
[11:20] understand.
[11:21] All right? Now, Jesus Christ paid the
[11:24] price. Don't misunderstand me. He paid
[11:27] the price. He redeemed us. All right? He
[11:30] gave us eternal life.
[11:33] All right? But that is only in the soul.
[11:36] That's right. Our body and our spirit is
[11:39] still in a realm of, you know, problems
[11:42] in life. Amen. Mortal problems. mortal.
[11:46] All right. But see, he
[11:49] promised a full plan of redemption.
[11:52] Amen. Right. So then we must know
[11:55] something about this full plan. Amen.
[11:58] That would involve not only the the soul
[12:01] of
[12:02] mankind cuz if we were just going with
[12:05] the soul being redeemed and everything
[12:07] was done back there, it was all finished
[12:09] and on all then we would be having to
[12:11] try to get us a new body. So that's why
[12:14] the world goes that way. See the
[12:15] religious world that they were going to
[12:17] get them a new body cuz they don't
[12:19] believe in this body being redeemed. But
[12:21] we believe in the plan of redemption for
[12:23] the body, spirit, soul, even for this
[12:26] world. Amen. That's right. That we live
[12:28] on. Amen. All right. See, but that was
[12:31] not made known back there. Right. All
[12:35] right. So then what is actually taking
[12:37] place?
[12:40] See, the emphasis is on the end time
[12:42] that we must have this. If not, then
[12:46] John was weeping trying to find a
[12:48] redeemer. Right. Right. That's right.
[12:52] Well, why would he be weeping when he
[12:54] already knew about Jesus
[12:57] Christ? Why would he be crying out for a
[13:00] redeemer? Right. That's right. That's
[13:02] right.
[13:04] when he was it was about
[13:06] 189596 and and John surely we believe
[13:10] that he was one of those in the upper
[13:12] room you know that's right about 1833
[13:16] somewhere
[13:17] when the Holy Ghost fell so then he had
[13:20] had the baptism of the Holy Ghost for
[13:22] quite a while right and he was chosen to
[13:25] write not only was he chosen to write
[13:28] the book of revelation he was chosen to
[13:30] write his own gospel right before he
[13:34] goes to Patmas. I mean, so he must have
[13:37] been very, you know, very knowledgeable.
[13:40] But why would he be coming over? As I
[13:42] was emphasizing the other day, why would
[13:44] he be coming over in the book of
[13:46] Revelations? See, wanting a redeemer.
[13:49] Amen.
[13:51] You know, why didn't he just jump up and
[13:52] say, "Glory, that was
[13:55] Jesus." Well, see, that's what the world
[13:57] thinks about him, right? That's what
[13:59] religious man thinks of. Yeah. Mhm. He
[14:02] doesn't consider anything about the book
[14:04] of Revelation. See, he can't comprehend
[14:06] it. Because why would you need a
[14:09] redeemer if you're saved, right? You
[14:12] know, and you can say to him, "Well, we
[14:15] needed a a redeemer for for the body and
[14:17] and the spirit. Well, we're going to get
[14:20] us a new one anyway." You
[14:22] know, but you see,
[14:24] church, the point I'm wanting to get to
[14:26] you tonight is one thing. And I've tried
[14:28] to make this point. And I want you to
[14:30] think about it
[14:33] now. There was something to take place
[14:35] in this last
[14:37] days that we need to comprehend. Amen.
[14:41] All right. Now, truly Jesus Christ paid
[14:44] the price. Amen. Amen. But he didn't
[14:48] purchase, you know, he didn't claim the
[14:50] possession. If you read the breach, I've
[14:52] asked you to to read the breach and read
[14:55] it and read it in that you'll find that
[14:58] he didn't claim the possession. He
[15:00] claimed the possession of your soul,
[15:02] right? Right. By the new birth, right?
[15:04] But he didn't claim possession on the
[15:06] body and thing to make it manifest. All
[15:09] right. Right. He claimed it because it
[15:11] was there, but he didn't take
[15:13] possession.
[15:15] These bodies and things are still in the
[15:17] domain of Satan. Right. Right. and and
[15:19] and you know they're they're not
[15:22] redeemed or not totally purchased at the
[15:26] time. Amen. Brought into manifestation,
[15:28] every how you want to say
[15:30] it. And that's what we're dealing with.
[15:34] All right? So then you would only have
[15:36] the part plan of
[15:38] redemption for the soul. You wouldn't
[15:41] have the plan of redemption for the body
[15:43] and the world and the things. You would
[15:45] just be dealing with the redemption of
[15:47] the soul. But see, nobody's ever had to
[15:50] face what you and I are
[15:52] facing the redemption of these bodies.
[15:55] Amen. And that's hard to bring to a
[15:58] place to explain to people, like I said,
[16:01] especially religious people. What do you
[16:03] mean? What I need to be saved for? I
[16:07] saved 40 years ago. My name is written
[16:10] on the
[16:12] book. But you you're dying. Right.
[16:15] Right.
[16:18] Right? Do you understand what I'm
[16:20] saying? I'm trying to to jog your memory
[16:24] about what you used to
[16:27] believe. You used to believe that you
[16:31] were saved in your soul that Jesus
[16:33] Christ done that. Right. Right. But then
[16:37] somebody say something about the body or
[16:38] something. Well, we're going to get a
[16:40] new
[16:41] one. And they wouldn't dare to say
[16:43] anything about this world being
[16:46] redeemed. Right. That's right. So then
[16:49] where would you
[16:51] go? See, that's just part plan of
[16:54] redemption. Right. That's right.
[16:58] You see what you'd be leaving out? Look
[17:00] where you'd be. You'd be a spook
[17:02] floating around up in heaven
[17:05] somewhere. Cuz then you could go through
[17:07] and prove say, "Well, well, Jesus had
[17:09] nail frets in his hand, so we're not
[17:11] going to get a new body, right? Is this
[17:14] his body redeemed?" Well, well, we'll
[17:16] just be floating on the clouds. We'll
[17:18] just be playing harps and and all kind
[17:20] of thing cuz that's what we all thought,
[17:22] right? But then the prophet began to
[17:25] talk about the plan of redemption.
[17:28] That's right.
[17:30] And he began even before the seals broke
[17:33] speaking of a kinsman redeemer. Amen.
[17:37] That would have to come and pay the
[17:38] price. Right. Right. Now, he spoke of a
[17:41] kinsman redeemer to come in the end
[17:43] time. So, that's what's made people,
[17:47] many of them think that he was God.
[17:50] That's right.
[17:52] Because he would be talking about a
[17:54] kinsman to
[17:55] come. But he wasn't talking about that.
[18:00] He was talking about the revelation of
[18:02] Jesus Christ. That's why we've been
[18:04] reading that from Peter there to be
[18:06] brought to you at the revelation of
[18:08] Jesus Christ. That's right. To reveal to
[18:11] you. All right. Now, see then the
[18:15] [Music]
[18:16] kinsman, the Lord Jesus Christ was our
[18:19] kinsman. Amen. Right. God came down in
[18:22] human flesh. All right. So, we know who
[18:26] the kinsman is.
[18:28] But what what is he what is John crying
[18:31] for in the book of Revelation?
[18:36] He crying for a kinsman. That's right.
[18:39] He's saying, "Is somebody worthy? Is
[18:41] there a man that can do
[18:45] this?" And yet we read, we'll and we'll
[18:48] read it a little more later on or maybe
[18:50] in the
[18:51] message. The elders said, "The line of
[18:55] the tribe of
[18:56] Judah has prevailed." Right? Overcome we
[19:00] have finished it.
[19:04] and he can loose the seven
[19:06] seals. All
[19:08] right. But then when John looks to see
[19:12] who's
[19:14] coming, he sees a
[19:17] lamb. One that had been slain. That's
[19:19] right.
[19:21] He knew who that was. That's right. He
[19:25] was there when he was crucified. That's
[19:27] right. All
[19:29] [Music]
[19:30] right. And that's what I've asked you.
[19:33] I've asked you to loosen your mind from
[19:35] your old
[19:38] thinking and see to try to think about
[19:41] what's
[19:42] happening. Well, we've been 40 something
[19:47] years since the leaving of the prophet
[19:50] and all the years that he was here with
[19:52] us
[19:54] preaching and preaching the plan of
[19:56] redemption. Right.
[19:58] Do we understand it now after all of
[20:00] these
[20:02] years? That's why I asked you a simple
[20:04] question. I said, "Is your faith strong
[20:07] enough to produce a lamb for you?"
[20:10] Right?
[20:12] Cuz it's got to be a personal thing.
[20:15] Right. Amen. Right.
[20:18] An individual affair.
[20:21] All right. Well, see, then we can look
[20:23] back at and we can say, "Well, cure
[20:29] Jesus Christ paid the
[20:33] price. But see, he didn't
[20:36] finish the
[20:40] work. See, it was to be finished in the
[20:43] end time.
[20:46] He went to the father's throne, right?
[20:49] Read through that
[20:52] to fulfill what he said in Revelation
[20:54] 3:21. He that overcome will sit with me
[20:56] in my throne as I've overcome and sit
[20:57] with the father in his throne. That's to
[20:59] this age. That's the the message to this
[21:03] age. See then by doing
[21:06] that he paid the
[21:10] price but he didn't take
[21:14] possession of the purchased product.
[21:17] All right. Right. So he's left us with
[21:22] time and time inside is God's worst
[21:26] enemies. Amen. And see in time man lost
[21:29] the understanding of even that Jesus was
[21:32] almighty God
[21:34] and come through with a trinitarian
[21:36] doctrine
[21:39] to believe in God in three persons
[21:40] blessed trinitarian you
[21:42] know co-equals and co-eternal when
[21:45] there's not
[21:46] sensible but see we came forth with
[21:51] that brother Rand preached a message one
[21:53] time said raising God from history.
[21:58] See, historical God won't save you.
[22:01] That's right.
[22:04] You can't be saved by something in the
[22:06] past. Listen. And you can't be saved by
[22:09] something in the future. Right. Right.
[22:12] That's right. You got to be something
[22:14] that's present tense. Amen. Cuz that's
[22:17] why that he said, "I am that I am."
[22:19] That's ever present for eternity.
[22:24] So what he done at Calvary is wonderful,
[22:30] but he didn't claim the possession at
[22:32] Calvary, right? He left that for the end
[22:37] time to where something would have to
[22:39] take
[22:41] place. See the book then remember how we
[22:45] went through it?
[22:47] You don't take a book and put a seal on
[22:51] it and close it up and sell it to the
[22:52] market and it'll be hypewritten.
[22:55] Right. Right.
[22:58] The book has got to be completed. Mhm.
[23:02] Then it could be sealed up. All right.
[23:05] Then you'd have something in the hand of
[23:07] the one sitting on the
[23:09] throne. All right. But see, then we take
[23:12] the other side. Now, let's just The one
[23:14] side of it is is looking at it as a oh,
[23:17] it's all finished back there. Don't know
[23:18] what y'all all talking about because it
[23:20] was finished back
[23:22] there. See, then the other side comes
[23:24] over here and says, "Well, well, look at
[23:26] here. What happened in the end
[23:28] time and they can't get the the the
[23:31] whole thing
[23:32] together. See, the plan of redemption
[23:34] was paid for at Calvary, right? He don't
[23:38] have to be crucified again.
[23:40] The purchase of our bodies was at
[23:42] Calvary. The purchase of the world was
[23:44] at Calvary. Right. Everything was
[23:47] purchased at Calvary.
[23:50] All
[23:52] right. But it wasn't applied. Right.
[23:55] Right. It wasn't applied to us. Had it
[23:59] been applied. See, it would have been
[24:00] done right
[24:02] there. See, we've
[24:05] had 2,000
[24:07] years. And like I said then in doing
[24:10] that we've even lost the understanding
[24:12] that that the one sitting on the throne
[24:14] was almighty God.
[24:19] We come up with a trinitarian ideas and
[24:22] all kind of
[24:24] ideas. And see none of that would be
[24:31] true. See the plan of
[24:36] redemption. The plan of
[24:40] redemption has got to be completed.
[24:44] That's right. Amen. When the lamb is
[24:46] That's what I ask you. I kept asking the
[24:49] question, do you believe redemption's
[24:53] over? I'm asking you seriously. Are
[24:56] anybody listening? Do you believe
[24:57] redemption's
[24:58] over? If you do, then the lamb can leave
[25:01] the mercy seat. Right?
[25:03] But he can't leave the mercy seat until
[25:05] redemption's
[25:06] over. That's why it couldn't be a line.
[25:09] See, the the elders said it would be a
[25:11] lion because he knew that it would be
[25:13] the line of the tribe of
[25:15] Judah. But when he looked, he was
[25:18] surprised because it was a lamb. Lamb
[25:21] has to do with salvation or redemption.
[25:25] Lion has to do with king or, you know,
[25:29] full inheritor.
[25:33] So then when it took place there, he
[25:36] could only be a lamb. It didn't say a
[25:39] lion come forth that was
[25:43] bloody. The lamb ain't
[25:48] bloody. Am I saying the the lion's not
[25:51] bloody? Let me say it right. All right.
[25:54] The lamb is the bloody one. Which means
[25:57] redemption. All right. But the lion is
[26:00] king. Right. When he leaves the throne
[26:03] of
[26:05] mercy, he is a lamb.
[26:08] Then he can become a lion. That's right.
[26:12] If you think redemption's over, like
[26:14] everybody, you know, half the message
[26:16] people believe redemption was over in '
[26:18] 63. Well, if it was, ain't nobody got
[26:20] saved since then.
[26:23] So, they'd leave out the biggest portion
[26:24] of us, wouldn't it? Amen. And the
[26:27] biggest portion of your families and
[26:28] things would be left out. That's right.
[26:32] But see, that's what I kept trying to
[26:34] make the
[26:34] emphasis. The book in the hand of the
[26:37] one sitting on the
[26:40] throne. That's the book of
[26:43] redemption. And brother R said there was
[26:45] only names written in that
[26:47] book. All right? It wasn't this kind of
[26:49] a
[26:50] do. This is what is handed to earth
[26:53] called the Bible. Amen. Right. The
[26:56] prophet called it the Bible in the hand
[26:58] of the one on the front. What's he
[26:59] saying? This Bible was written about the
[27:02] names.
[27:03] Right. That was in the book of life.
[27:06] Right.
[27:07] Right. Even to covering Judas and like
[27:11] that his name was in the book of life,
[27:14] but it was not in the eternal
[27:18] section. Right. That's right. Cuz he
[27:21] didn't get eternal
[27:22] life. All right. So then the the book of
[27:25] life has to be an eternal section and
[27:28] then it has to be a natural
[27:31] section. This Bible is a natural thing
[27:34] telling you what's happening on earth.
[27:36] But at the same time it's a revelation
[27:38] of Jesus
[27:39] Christ to reveal eternal life to you and
[27:42] I. All right. Now that being true,
[27:50] then why would it be that the elders I
[27:54] said would be calling for a
[27:59] redeemer? Someone that could take the
[28:02] book and loose the
[28:08] seals. Do not get my point. You'll
[28:10] understand why the prophet would be
[28:11] saying he said John was
[28:16] weeping not because that he wasn't
[28:19] worthy to take the book but said he was
[28:23] weeping that if somebody didn't take the
[28:25] book all would be lost.
[28:31] And so we know for
[28:34] certainty if you have eternal
[28:37] life. Are you listening to what I was
[28:39] trying to bring and bring it down to
[28:41] you? If you have eternal life
[28:44] tonight, then there is definitely a lamb
[28:48] to take the book, right? Are you
[28:50] following me? If you have eternal life,
[28:53] now if you don't have it, there's no
[28:54] lamb for you. Amen. You're just
[28:57] confessing something. Mhm. But you see
[29:00] what it was that when John was
[29:04] weeping, he saw the lamb and he saw the
[29:07] things. He knew Jesus Christ had paid
[29:10] the
[29:12] price, but he also
[29:16] knew that that old body was still giving
[29:19] the trouble.
[29:24] But you see when that lamb come forth,
[29:27] John stopped his weeping.
[29:31] But the elder said a lion would come
[29:36] forth. Are you listening? See, why
[29:38] didn't John said, "Wait just a minute.
[29:40] Wait a
[29:42] minute. I'm up here and I understand a
[29:45] little
[29:46] bit. I know he's the lion of the tribe
[29:49] of Judah.
[29:52] cuz that's where Jesus came for in the
[29:54] natural lineage part
[29:56] from Judah. All right. A lawgiver would
[29:59] come from Judah. All right. Now, we know
[30:01] it didn't come down to him. It come down
[30:03] to
[30:04] Joseph. But still, it was the connection
[30:06] to earthly
[30:09] forms. John knew the line of the tribe
[30:12] of Judah would be worthy. That's right.
[30:18] Come on. cuz he he he had lived his life
[30:21] with him. He knew who that was. Right.
[30:28] But yet when the lamb stepped out, John
[30:31] quit really weeping because he really
[30:33] began to realize, "Hey, wait just a
[30:36] minute. I was down
[30:39] there when John the Baptist stood out
[30:41] there and didn't say the line of the
[30:44] tribe of Judah, right?
[30:46] said, "The lamb of God will take away
[30:48] the sins of the world." That's right.
[30:51] Amen. See, then it all begin to come
[30:53] together with John.
[30:55] He wasn't going, "Wait a minute now. You
[30:57] just go stand over there. I still want a
[31:01] line." No, he knew then redemption
[31:04] wasn't over. Right. Mhm.
[31:07] So he knew as long as he stayed a
[31:10] lamb and stayed connected to that
[31:14] throne that salvation would be
[31:17] here. All right. Amen. And if we don't
[31:20] believe redemption's over
[31:26] tonight, then the lamb's still on the
[31:30] mercy seat. Amen. Right.
[31:33] Yeah. But brother Random when he
[31:34] preached the lamb left the earth. I've
[31:37] asked you to read. I've asked you to
[31:39] read if you
[31:41] will. Why is it people don't read what
[31:43] brother
[31:46] said? They asked him, "Was salvation
[31:50] over?" He said, "I never said nothing
[31:52] like that." Right?
[31:56] They ask him said, "We go out and
[31:59] preach." Cuz see they thought when the
[32:01] lamb left the mercy seat that it left it
[32:03] right there with brother Random and
[32:05] walked down and some even wanted to take
[32:08] from souls in prison where brother Ram
[32:10] was talking about the lamb taking the
[32:11] book and said climbed up on the throne
[32:13] and sat down. He said I'm the one that
[32:15] did it and people wants to take that as
[32:17] being brother Ram is the one that did
[32:21] it. See making him deity. Mhm.
[32:27] But are you listening right? Mhm. The
[32:31] elder had a
[32:34] line. He was looking for a king. Mhm.
[32:39] And he saw a bloody
[32:41] lamb. Amen. And then he
[32:44] realized what was taking
[32:47] place. He realized as long as that lamb
[32:50] stays on that mercy seat, you remember
[32:53] in the Old Testament the prophet would
[32:54] explain it. He said as long as a lamb
[32:57] was on the mercy seat, he said
[32:58] everything was okay. But he said if that
[33:00] lamb ever left that mercy seat, he said
[33:01] it become judgment seat.
[33:08] You say, "Well, I want him here today as
[33:09] a line." You better be careful, right?
[33:13] That means redemption's over if he's
[33:15] here as a
[33:19] line. Right?
[33:22] But you see church, what I've tried to
[33:23] get you to
[33:25] see, I was looking at something today,
[33:27] thinking about it about this lion and
[33:31] lamb. You know, the proclamation went
[33:33] out in the fifth
[33:36] chapter for a lion or the elder said,
[33:40] you know, behold the line of the tribe
[33:41] of Judah has
[33:43] prevailed. You know, that word line is
[33:46] not mentioned again until Revelations
[33:48] 10:3.
[33:54] Go on, read your
[33:57] Bible. Well, I don't know whether that's
[33:59] right or not. Well, go
[34:01] read and come and show
[34:07] me. He's a lamb all the way through
[34:09] there because even when we leave out of
[34:11] here, there is redemption. Right. Right.
[34:14] For Israel. That's right. True.
[34:18] True. Mhm. Right. But see, we want a
[34:26] line. If a lion is here, redemption's
[34:29] over and he's king. And brother Ren said
[34:32] he comes to claim right his possession
[34:37] as king. That's right.
[34:43] See, the lamb is paying the
[34:46] price. Yeah. The lamb pays for the
[34:49] redemption,
[34:50] but the lion is the king. Mhm.
[34:57] But you better remember too, now
[34:59] something I said to you. So you ought to
[35:01] go read your
[35:04] Bible. He's never mentioned as a li a l
[35:08] a line again until Revelations
[35:11] 10. But the lamb stays clean on over
[35:14] into Revelation 21. Right. Amen.
[35:23] read your
[35:25] Bible. That's right.
[35:28] See, because when he becomes
[35:31] king, the little bride is the only
[35:34] one that knows him as
[35:37] king. Sure, he'll be king of the world.
[35:40] King of all, so will we.
[35:44] It's like they say, you know, you know,
[35:46] the only thing out in the in the jungles
[35:49] of Africa that's not afraid of the lion
[35:53] is
[35:55] what? His
[35:57] wife. She loves to hear that sound.
[36:00] Everything else is scared. Elephants
[36:04] run. Big old animals, they just run from
[36:08] him. Why? Cuz he's king. But you know
[36:10] what? She's laying over in the bush and
[36:12] said, "That's my husband.
[36:15] I'm okay.
[36:17] That's right. I got a one that's my
[36:19] king. I can take care of every He'll
[36:21] take care of everything. I don't have to
[36:22] worry.
[36:24] But listen to that and just think about
[36:25] it sometime. Just let these things run
[36:27] through your mind.
[36:31] The call was for a
[36:33] lion, but a lamb comes
[36:37] forth to pay the price. Right. All
[36:41] right.
[36:46] Now, see, then in looking at
[36:52] it, what we're seeing is the plan of
[36:55] redemption being made
[36:58] known to the bride of Jesus
[37:02] Christ. Come on now.
[37:05] When we're reading the book of
[37:08] Revelations, the lamb is
[37:12] revealing the book of Revelations to you
[37:14] and
[37:15] I, but the world's not seeing it,
[37:21] right? Amen. Only the bride is seeing
[37:24] the book being revealed. Why? Cuz she's
[37:27] seal over with the book also, right? And
[37:29] she knows she's being revealed
[37:31] also. So now, are we back where I
[37:34] started at?
[37:36] Then show me in the book of Revelation
[37:38] Jesus Christ ever standing by
[37:40] himself. He's always in bride form or in
[37:43] with the
[37:44] bride. He's never by himself.
[37:48] It's a wonderful
[37:49] book if we just read it correctly.
[37:53] But now
[37:58] listen. The elders said the lion was
[38:05] worthy, but a lamb comes
[38:14] forth. That don't connect with
[38:18] him to see. As long as he's a lamb, he's
[38:21] redeemer.
[38:27] Redemption can't be over until the last
[38:30] name comes in. Right. Right.
[38:34] The nice name is brought to the
[38:37] earth and then redemption will be
[38:41] over. All
[38:43] right. Now if that's true
[38:49] then see then we better find out we're
[38:52] here in the end
[38:56] time. Why is the emphasis placed then
[38:59] upon the end time?
[39:03] Why did not John just write
[39:05] that the lamb of God when it said you
[39:08] know I can understand this part to where
[39:09] he said you know the line has is
[39:14] worthy I can see John as he maybe
[39:17] stagger back but he remembers that Jesus
[39:19] Christ has come from the line of the
[39:21] tribe of Judah he remembers that but he
[39:24] knows while he's upon earth as I said a
[39:26] while ago he was introduced as the lamb
[39:27] of God
[39:32] Right now, he's been the lamb for 2,000
[39:35] years.
[39:39] He's not the lamb
[39:42] yet. He can't forth can't come forth as
[39:45] the lion until redemption over. Right.
[39:49] Amen.
[39:51] Right. The book has to be completed.
[39:54] Right.
[39:56] Finished.
[39:58] sealed up
[40:01] and you and I are sealed with the book.
[40:05] So then the plan of redemption is being
[40:07] seen from Calvary and it's still going
[40:12] on. Are you following me?
[40:15] It's still going on, right?
[40:19] But yet we couldn't
[40:22] comprehend the full plan of redemption
[40:25] as I was
[40:27] saying. But see now after we've heard
[40:29] the message in order to at least bring
[40:31] it to our remembrance of what's going
[40:33] on.
[40:36] See, then there would have to be then in
[40:38] the end
[40:42] time, not the coming forth of a
[40:45] lion. That can't be done until
[40:47] redemption's over.
[40:52] But the coming forth of a
[40:54] lamb. All right. Amen.
[40:59] And without having to go into detail,
[41:01] but remember the last message we
[41:05] preached, you remember how I was trying
[41:08] to emphasize that we must be the word
[41:10] made flesh. Right. All right.
[41:16] Mary, brother
[41:19] Random says, "See not with a shook."
[41:21] It's also on
[41:23] masterpiece. There's two seeds not with
[41:25] a shook. One in the jail. And he says it
[41:27] on both of them. He said Mary was not
[41:29] the seed.
[41:32] He said she was the carrier.
[41:36] Mary had the seed within her. Right.
[41:40] But she was not that seed.
[41:43] Now that's not decianizing Mary or
[41:45] throwing her away or it's telling the
[41:46] God's honest truth about her.
[41:50] She was not God. Right. That's right.
[41:55] Neither is she the mother of God.
[41:59] He just bared her womb.
[42:03] All right.
[42:05] But see, she's not God, so she's not
[42:07] that
[42:08] seed. But God was in Mary.
[42:13] Mary gave birth to the word, right?
[42:17] God Almighty manifested in human flesh.
[42:24] She gave birth to it. All right. Run
[42:27] around them in those messages said Mary
[42:30] represented a Zusa street
[42:37] Pentecost. He said Luther wasn't the
[42:41] seed. Wesley wasn't the
[42:45] seed. Pentecostal 1906 Zusa Street. I
[42:49] say that where you won't confuse me with
[42:51] the book of Acts cuz that was the word
[42:52] in the book of
[42:55] Acts. Right? You see those ages only had
[42:58] a partial realization of understanding.
[43:01] That's right.
[43:04] So they were not the fully matured seed.
[43:06] Now listen, don't misunderstand and go
[43:08] on. You read what he
[43:12] says. He said, "I don't know where he
[43:14] said." Well, send me word. I'll send you
[43:16] the copies of the I'll send you the book
[43:18] if I need
[43:19] to. Brother Rander said Luther was not
[43:22] that seed. What? He was the seed of God
[43:25] for the age he was in. That's right.
[43:27] Right.
[43:28] Yes, sir. But he wasn't a fully matured
[43:31] seed. That's right. He was a trinitarian
[43:33] baptized in the power of father, son,
[43:35] holy ghost and said the Jews were to be
[43:37] taken out and killed or something like
[43:39] that. Mhm.
[43:43] But you see the seed he had was proven
[43:45] and pure, right? Of the just shall live
[43:47] by faith.
[43:51] All right. So we used the corn of wheat,
[43:55] right? You know, stalk, tassel, etc.
[43:59] Shuck. That's what your prophet used in
[44:02] there.
[44:03] showing us then that the
[44:05] shuck is only the shelter which the
[44:09] shuck was
[44:10] Mary that gave birth to the word. The
[44:13] shuck was a Zusa street Pentecost that
[44:16] gave birth to Jesus Christ. Yes.
[44:19] And you and I by our new birth must come
[44:22] to a place of birth in
[44:24] Christ. But that's a baby form of
[44:27] Christ. Amen.
[44:31] Right. See, what I'm asking you is the
[44:34] same thing I did. Is your faith powerful
[44:36] enough to produce a lamb?
[44:41] Cuz see, the emphasis of the prophet's
[44:43] message in the Bible is pointing down to
[44:45] the end time that there'd be a group of
[44:48] people upon this earth that would not
[44:51] only give birth to the word, but become
[44:54] that word. That's right. Amen.
[44:59] This not for us to be Luther Wesley or
[45:01] anything.
[45:02] off. If I was back there, I'd been happy
[45:05] to be back cuz that would been the word
[45:07] for the age. But they were not the
[45:09] mature seed,
[45:11] right? Like I was saying there Sunday
[45:14] then. You don't go out and look at your
[45:16] corn, got some at the house, you go out,
[45:19] pull it, it's ready to eat. Boy, that's
[45:21] good stuff. You
[45:23] know, I I eat it sometimes just without
[45:26] even cooking it.
[45:27] [Music]
[45:28] Just raw corn. Yeah, kind of give you
[45:32] the belly ache, but still all right.
[45:34] It's
[45:35] good. But you don't dare take it out and
[45:38] plant it,
[45:39] right? Some of us here are old enough to
[45:42] understand, a lot of you young whiffer
[45:43] snappers, you don't know what we're
[45:45] talking
[45:46] about. Now, some of us old enough to
[45:48] understand, you don't plant
[45:50] corn.
[45:53] No, when it's
[45:55] green, you wait until it dries and
[45:58] seasoned
[45:59] out. Then you can plant it. And it's
[46:02] really got to be seasoned real good or
[46:05] it won't come
[46:07] up. You see, the prophet was pointing
[46:09] down to you and I. We must be the word.
[46:14] That's right.
[46:15] All right. See, then the book must be
[46:21] completed. The same thing I explained
[46:23] about the corn wheat coming down. You
[46:24] get a full ear of corn. And that's why
[46:26] Jesus called it, the full ear in the
[46:28] corn, you know.
[46:32] He's speaking of the end time when it
[46:33] would come down and we must become the
[46:35] word.
[46:38] All
[46:41] right. Now, let me ask you a
[46:45] question. You better be careful how you
[46:47] answer it. I don't want it out loud
[46:49] anyway. You can just do it to yourself,
[46:50] but be careful.
[46:54] Do you believe that we are to give birth
[46:55] to the
[46:59] word? Do you believe that we're supposed
[47:01] to have a new birth? Right. A baptism of
[47:04] the Holy Ghost, eternal life in our
[47:06] soul, and give birth to Jesus Christ,
[47:08] the word.
[47:10] All right. Now, if you believe that, I
[47:14] mean, truly believe
[47:18] that, then you can see what I'm talking
[47:20] about with the rest of the message. Cuz
[47:23] you see that lamb to take the
[47:28] book. Now I hope you understand what I'm
[47:31] saying. Jesus Christ paid the
[47:34] price, right? He done the work. The
[47:37] kinsman, he done it back there, but it
[47:40] wasn't applied back there,
[47:42] right? It'll only be applied in the end
[47:45] time, right? All right. So if you
[47:48] believe you gave birth to the word by
[47:49] the new
[47:53] birth and one of the quotes I've got in
[47:55] here somewhere said when when you see in
[47:57] the word you see in Jesus. Amen.
[48:03] Come on. Then there's no place for us to
[48:04] go.
[48:06] Now you'll hear these words if you'll
[48:08] listen to the prophet in that seed not
[48:11] ever the shuck masterpiece. He said
[48:12] there's no other stage
[48:15] for us to go to. That's right. There's
[48:18] no more carriers. He said,
[48:21] he said Mary was the life
[48:25] carrier. Pentecostus
[48:27] street 1906 was the life carrier of the
[48:32] word.
[48:34] He said there's no place for us to go.
[48:36] We ain't got a
[48:38] place. You know what? We got to become
[48:40] the word. Right.
[48:42] miss.
[48:45] We got to become the word,
[48:49] right? We got to become the book. Mhm.
[48:55] The book then is filled and we're filled
[48:57] with the book.
[49:03] Right. So then what's our
[49:08] problem? Now I'm going to ask you the
[49:10] question.
[49:13] Where did that
[49:17] lamb come from?
[49:24] Where did that lamb in Revelations come
[49:25] from? That's right. Now, I'm going back
[49:29] over it again because I I know how the
[49:31] mind
[49:33] wonders. The lamb of God that takes away
[49:36] the sin of the world was introduced and
[49:39] died on Calvary to pay the
[49:42] price. But he's had to do the kinsman
[49:45] redeemer
[49:48] work until redemption is
[49:53] over. Then he can become the lion of the
[49:56] tribe of Judah.
[49:59] Where' that lamb come from?
[50:02] I know I've bypassed the quotes,
[50:03] brothers, back there, brother Anderson,
[50:05] but just if you will jump up to
[50:06] Revelations
[50:09] 5 and let's just read
[50:14] it. I give these brothers notes and
[50:16] things and sometimes I don't use them,
[50:18] sometimes I do. So, I'm
[50:20] sorry, but listen, just read it.
[50:25] And I saw in the right hand of him that
[50:26] sat on the throne a book written within
[50:28] and on the backside sealed with seven
[50:30] seals. See that that scripture right
[50:33] there is the basis of what most people
[50:35] in the message all they want to know
[50:37] about. Is it written in the book or
[50:39] what's on the book? Is anything added to
[50:40] the book or what's on the outside the
[50:41] book? What's what what kind of book is
[50:43] it? What's that? They spend their whole
[50:44] life talking about that. Never talk
[50:47] about the rest of
[50:49] it. Now come on. You tell me if they
[50:52] didn't. Look what he said. And I saw a
[50:54] strong angel proclaimed with a loud
[50:56] voice, who is worthy to open the book
[50:57] and to loose the seal dirt. And no man
[51:00] is not searching for a beast or a lamb
[51:02] or a lion or a dog or a cat or or a
[51:06] horse or anything. It's looking for a
[51:08] man. Right.
[51:10] Right. And no man in heaven nor in
[51:12] earth, neither under the earth was able
[51:14] to open the book, neither to look their
[51:16] own. And I wept much because no man was
[51:19] found worthy to open and to read the
[51:21] book, neither to look their own.
[51:24] He knew we had to have the revelation.
[51:26] That's right. That's right. Come on,
[51:28] read it. He knew we had to have the
[51:30] revelation. And how was we going to get
[51:33] it if they didn't a man come forth?
[51:36] Well, look, verse five. And one of the
[51:39] elders saith unto me, weak not. Behold,
[51:41] the lion of the tribe of Judah, the root
[51:43] of David, hath prevailed to open the
[51:44] book, and to loose the seven seat
[51:46] thereof. And I'll be held in low in the
[51:48] midst of the throne.
[51:53] and of the four
[51:56] beasts. And in the midst of the
[52:01] elders, you remember chapter 4, we went
[52:03] through all of these over and over and
[52:05] over. The throne, what is that? The
[52:08] father's throne, the baptism of the Holy
[52:11] Ghost, right? Who are the who are the
[52:15] the four beasts, the combat beast down
[52:18] through the ages and things, right?
[52:21] And who are the
[52:23] elders? The 24 elders. Who are
[52:26] they? 12 apostles, 12 patriarchs. We
[52:29] went through all of this,
[52:31] right? See, John didn't the lamb just
[52:34] don't appear somewhere else. You've got
[52:35] to connect back to ever every phase out
[52:37] on the way down. And behold, the Lord in
[52:39] the midst of the throne and of the four
[52:42] beasts. In the midst of the elders stood
[52:44] a lamb as it had been slain, having
[52:47] seven horns and seven eyes, which are
[52:49] the seven spirits of God set forth into
[52:52] all the
[52:54] earth.
[52:56] Now, what kind of a lamb is
[53:02] that? First off, he's bloody, bleeding.
[53:06] If you've read the breach, you heard the
[53:08] prophet say
[53:10] it cuz he was slain at Calvary.
[53:15] Right. Right.
[53:18] But that man that was hanging on Calvary
[53:21] didn't have seven horns and seven eyes.
[53:24] Right.
[53:27] He was the son of
[53:30] man who died for you and I. That's
[53:32] right. Amen. But said he died son of
[53:34] man. and said he raised son of God,
[53:36] right? And he's been son of God down
[53:38] through the seven church ages cuz he's
[53:40] not on his right throne. That's what
[53:42] Jesus was talking about. He that
[53:43] overcome to sit with me in my throne as
[53:44] I've overcome sit my father at his
[53:46] throne. Father's strong spirit is the
[53:47] baptism of the Holy Ghost. The son of
[53:49] God down through the ages. Why you a
[53:51] prophet would keep saying those things
[53:52] like unveiling of God, mighty God
[53:54] unveiled to read
[53:57] them. But look what he's saying. funny
[54:00] looking
[54:04] lion. Now, come on. Do you see what I'm
[54:06] talking about? First off, it says he was
[54:10] slain. All right, that puts it right
[54:12] back over there at Calvary where he paid
[54:14] the price, right?
[54:17] But why didn't he just walk out
[54:19] there and say, "I'm here."
[54:26] Where did the lamb come from?
[54:29] We'll show you why he's got seven horns
[54:31] and seven eyes. That's right. Amen.
[54:38] See, the horns and the eyes show where
[54:39] he come from. Right.
[54:42] Right.
[54:44] Cuz we know he was slain.
[54:50] All
[54:51] right. See, the lamb had been
[54:55] slain, but he had seven horns and seven
[54:58] eyes, which he says is the seven spirits
[55:02] of
[55:05] God. Now, I've been over this with you.
[55:07] I've got them laying here in front of me
[55:08] if you want to read them. There's not
[55:11] seven spirits of God, right?
[55:13] There are not
[55:15] nine no more seven spirits of God and
[55:18] there are nine gifts in the basis of
[55:20] it's the one Holy Spirit with nine
[55:24] manifestations
[55:25] right am I right now nine manifestations
[55:29] of the same Holy Spirit. So it's not
[55:32] seven spirits like God has got seven
[55:35] spirits. It's the spirit of God down
[55:37] through the seven church ages.
[55:40] The
[55:41] horns
[55:45] see is the Holy
[55:48] Spirit anointing a messenger. Horns and
[55:55] eyes. Come on,
[56:00] church. Horns means seven
[56:02] ages. Paragraph 204, Revelation chapter
[56:06] 5.
[56:08] Seven horns was the eight seven
[56:11] ages taken from the breach. Paragraph
[56:15] 231. Pull up number six cuz I love this
[56:20] one. Pull up number six and let's see
[56:22] what kind of a lamb you're looking
[56:28] at. He's tying it back to Jerubable and
[56:32] the eyes, the seven, the eyes of the
[56:34] Lord. Right? All right. Now watch when
[56:37] the seven eyes. Eyes means seeing.
[56:39] Seeing means prophets. Seers. This lamb
[56:42] had seven horns. And on each horn had an
[56:48] eye. Odd looking lamb. Is it horn
[56:51] sticking out? An eye on the end of
[56:57] it. And on each horn had an eye. Seven
[57:00] eyes. What is
[57:02] it? What is it? What are you looking at?
[57:06] Christ and his bride, right? Amen.
[57:10] Seven church ages. Out of there was
[57:13] seven prophets that went forth, seven
[57:15] seers eyes. So the last one must be a
[57:18] seer. All
[57:19] right. Each one of those ages would be a
[57:22] prophet in the basis of a of the age
[57:25] that they're in for the prophet. Right.
[57:28] Right. But around could call them
[57:30] prophets. No problem. But who is that?
[57:34] It's the
[57:37] lamb. The lamb of
[57:40] God. Where did he come
[57:45] from? Look at number
[57:48] seven. Taken from the breach. 1963 317
[57:52] paragraph 194. John hadn't noticed this
[57:55] lamb
[57:58] before. You know,
[58:00] here he hadn't been mentioned before.
[58:04] Right? Cuz there's a reading coming
[58:07] up. Nowhere had it been
[58:09] mentioned. John didn't see it all over
[58:12] the heavens as he was looking. But here
[58:15] it come
[58:17] forth. Now when the proclamation went
[58:20] forth for the redeemer, why didn't John
[58:23] see it? That's what he's emphasizing.
[58:25] Cuz he looked all over heaven. Brother
[58:26] Ram says, he said, "Heaven was scour and
[58:30] earth was round sack." One of the two. I
[58:32] know he use those words. And he said no
[58:35] man was found worthy. He said the
[58:37] prophets were all standing there. He
[58:39] said Moses was standing there. He said
[58:41] Elijah was standing there. He said all
[58:43] of those pro all of those born again
[58:46] Christians that had
[58:49] died was standing there. But they
[58:52] wouldn't
[58:53] worthy. Why didn't John see the lamb?
[58:56] Where had the lamb
[58:59] been? Look what he tells you where it
[59:02] been. All over heaven as he's looking.
[59:05] But here it come forth. Notice where it
[59:08] came
[59:10] forth. Where did it come
[59:13] from? It come from the father's
[59:18] throne. Where he had been seated since
[59:21] he had been slain and raised again.
[59:25] He raised up and sat on the right hand
[59:27] of God ever living to make
[59:30] intercession. Where does the lamb come
[59:32] from?
[59:35] Where does that lamb come from to take
[59:36] the
[59:37] book to loose the seven
[59:41] seals? We know there's only one lamb.
[59:44] Right. Right. The Lord Jesus Christ.
[59:48] All right. But we just read the quote
[59:51] prior to this one that brother R said it
[59:52] was Christ and his bride.
[59:57] So once we're united together, how can
[59:59] we be separated? And remember chapter 4,
[1:00:02] the bride goes up in the rapture.
[1:00:04] Chapter 5 is the bride in
[1:00:07] glory. You remember that was the
[1:00:09] question. We'll get to it later. That
[1:00:10] was the question they asked brother
[1:00:11] Brandham. He said, "No, that's not the
[1:00:13] bride." He stood there and he started to
[1:00:14] go on and he stopped and he said,
[1:00:16] "There's something wrong."
[1:00:17] Yeah, brother Ned Ison was one that told
[1:00:20] him said, "Read your question over
[1:00:22] again, your
[1:00:25] scripture." He went back and read it
[1:00:27] again. He said, "See where I'd have made
[1:00:28] a mistake." He said, "That is the bride
[1:00:29] and glory in Revelations 5."
[1:00:35] See, one of these days we'll understand
[1:00:37] the statement he made there in that
[1:00:39] message. He said, "This is actually the
[1:00:41] opening of those seals."
[1:00:45] You said, "No, that wasn't until later."
[1:00:47] And that's where you're missing what
[1:00:48] I've been trying to say. The bride is
[1:00:51] sealed
[1:00:54] up. She is those seals because she's
[1:00:57] Jesus Christ. The age you say, "No, wait
[1:01:00] a minute. It's Jesus." But where's he
[1:01:02] at?
[1:01:05] This lamb by itself, a bloody lamb would
[1:01:07] have been good. That would have been
[1:01:09] Jesus. But when you put the seven horns
[1:01:11] and the seven eyes on the same lamb,
[1:01:13] what have you got?
[1:01:16] That's right. You got him and his
[1:01:18] church. That's right. Him and his bride
[1:01:21] as one. That's right. You remember
[1:01:25] that's what I told
[1:01:27] you. Those two witnesses going to tell
[1:01:29] those Jews, you missed
[1:01:32] it. And the gentile people accepted
[1:01:36] Jesus Christ as their savior.
[1:01:41] and said, "Now they've gone in a rapture
[1:01:43] and you're here in the
[1:01:46] tribulation. They're going to preach us
[1:01:48] to
[1:01:49] them, right?
[1:01:52] They're going to take this message to
[1:01:56] Israel." And you know what this message
[1:01:58] is? You and
[1:02:00] me. We are the message. Amen. Amen. And
[1:02:04] brother Ram is part of the message.
[1:02:07] Amen. Are you listening? Amen. So then
[1:02:10] what was it?
[1:02:14] You come from the father's throne. The
[1:02:16] father strong is a baptism of the holy
[1:02:18] ghost dwelling in the life of the bride
[1:02:20] upon
[1:02:21] earth. Now don't do away what's in
[1:02:23] heaven. Cuz remember we got to be here.
[1:02:26] What is
[1:02:27] there? That's the key. We got to be
[1:02:29] here. What is there? Got to be on earth
[1:02:31] exactly what's in heaven. So what's in
[1:02:33] heaven? Jesus Christ sitting on the
[1:02:35] throne. How many is on that throne? Did
[1:02:38] the father get up, walk off, and the son
[1:02:40] came over, sat down?
[1:02:47] No. And this lamb when he took the book,
[1:02:49] what did he
[1:02:54] do? What did this lamb do? I didn't give
[1:02:56] these to the brothers.
[1:02:59] You've heard it. Souls in prison,
[1:03:01] 1963, 11:10, paragraph 149. And the lamb
[1:03:05] came forth, walked, took to him that had
[1:03:07] the book in his right hand, and received
[1:03:10] the book, climbed upon the throne, and
[1:03:12] sat down. Amen.
[1:03:15] Getting crowded on the
[1:03:18] throne. A lamb with seven horns and
[1:03:20] seven eyes sitting on one throne. Christ
[1:03:23] and his bride sitting on one throne.
[1:03:26] Amen.
[1:03:27] 1964 12:27. Who do you say this is?
[1:03:33] Behold, the lion of the tribe of Judah
[1:03:35] has prevailed. John looking to see a
[1:03:37] lion. He saw a lamb that had been slain.
[1:03:39] A bloody lamb come forth and took the
[1:03:41] book, climbed up on the throne, and sat
[1:03:47] down. You see,
[1:03:50] church, if Christ is not in our hearts
[1:03:53] in the right way, he's not on the
[1:03:54] throne. Right.
[1:04:00] See, we've got to see him correctly. We
[1:04:03] got to see that one true and living God
[1:04:05] correctly to realize what's in our
[1:04:06] hearts and our throne. What throne we've
[1:04:08] made him. Do you realize we make him a
[1:04:11] throne for him to sit on? We give him
[1:04:13] our souls to come and live in that
[1:04:15] provides a a a place for that lamb to
[1:04:18] live.
[1:04:20] And he's doing his redemption through
[1:04:21] you. Mhm. Come on, church. How many
[1:04:25] times do we need to preach
[1:04:27] it? Did the prophet say, "If you don't
[1:04:30] have enough faith for your children,
[1:04:33] I doubt you having faith for yourself."
[1:04:36] Do you need that
[1:04:41] quote? Why is it when we dedicate a
[1:04:44] baby, we dedicate to have everybody in
[1:04:46] the building to dedicate one baby? Why?
[1:04:49] Because you're dedicated to live before
[1:04:51] that baby, right?
[1:04:54] The mama and daddy raises the baby.
[1:04:55] They're dedicated to raising it. But you
[1:04:57] and I are dedicated to live a Christian
[1:04:59] life before it where it can see Jesus
[1:05:03] Christ. Come
[1:05:05] on. Where does that lamb come from? He
[1:05:09] comes from the father's
[1:05:12] throne. Brother Ramon said in another
[1:05:14] quote, he said he was here backing
[1:05:15] behind the throne. Said he comes
[1:05:19] forth. What's he talking about?
[1:05:23] What is he talking about when the lamb
[1:05:25] takes a book climbed up on the throne
[1:05:26] and sits
[1:05:28] down? Simple terminologies. He's
[1:05:31] becoming the one on the throne. Right?
[1:05:33] That's the way our understanding ought
[1:05:35] to be. We not have if we look up there
[1:05:37] and send 10 thrones, we look back and
[1:05:39] say something's wrong, right?
[1:05:43] Cuz there's only one God, right?
[1:05:47] There's only one throne, right?
[1:05:50] We're going to sit with him in that
[1:05:51] throne. That kingdom, a throne is a
[1:05:54] domain, a kingdom, right? And we're
[1:05:56] going to sit with him in that
[1:05:59] throne, right?
[1:06:03] Where does the lamb come
[1:06:05] from? See, the body is there now sitting
[1:06:08] on the father's
[1:06:10] throne. Right hand power. All of those.
[1:06:12] We've been through
[1:06:14] it. And you know where we are? We are
[1:06:17] his power and authority here on earth.
[1:06:18] Right. We're his right hand upon earth.
[1:06:22] Right. We are the redeemed. And the
[1:06:24] Bible said, "Let the redeemed say so."
[1:06:26] Amen.
[1:06:29] Where does that lamb come from?
[1:06:33] It has to be
[1:06:36] reproduced by the only way that it could
[1:06:39] ever be. Because if you brought another
[1:06:42] lamb upon the earth in the end time like
[1:06:44] that lamb, you would have two gods. Mhm.
[1:06:48] But if you let that God come down and
[1:06:51] live in a people, Amen. and let those
[1:06:54] people become the horns and the eyes of
[1:06:57] the almighty God. That's right. Then you
[1:07:00] still got one God. Right. You know that
[1:07:03] brother Random said, I'm looking at him
[1:07:04] today. He said, "The Godhead is not
[1:07:06] complete without
[1:07:08] you." Father, Son, Holy Ghost, that's
[1:07:10] Godhead. Well, the Holy Ghost is in you,
[1:07:13] right? So he's not complete without you,
[1:07:16] right?
[1:07:18] You don't understand what he's saying,
[1:07:19] right? If you have eternal life inside
[1:07:22] of you, then the eternal life inside of
[1:07:24] you is a part of eternal life of God. So
[1:07:27] he's not complete without you. Right?
[1:07:33] Where does that lamb come
[1:07:36] from now? Can you tie back to what I say
[1:07:38] in Sunday afternoon? Can you tie back to
[1:07:41] what I went over just a moment ago? Mary
[1:07:43] was not the same. She gave birth to the
[1:07:47] sea. She was a carrier.
[1:07:50] But there's no more types and
[1:07:56] shadows. We have to be him. That's
[1:07:59] right. Make manifest. Amen.
[1:08:02] In bride
[1:08:09] form. So he's standing there in bride
[1:08:11] form in Revelations 5.
[1:08:15] Is that hard to understand?
[1:08:19] You see him, you see her.
[1:08:23] Right. That's right.
[1:08:28] Come on. You see a man, you see his
[1:08:30] wife.
[1:08:33] We got along. We started looking alike.
[1:08:36] Sorry,
[1:08:40] young. that everybody except Joyce and
[1:08:43] Danny cuz they're having problems in
[1:08:46] it. I don't know which one of them two
[1:08:48] have to change.
[1:08:50] But now
[1:08:53] listen, the lamb here in the acts of the
[1:08:57] play that we've been talking about cuz
[1:08:59] remember the prophet said Revelations 5
[1:09:02] is not a verse byvere description. He
[1:09:05] said it's the
[1:09:10] scene where there's a preparing he said
[1:09:14] for the opening of the
[1:09:16] seals. A
[1:09:18] scene. One of these days we get down to
[1:09:20] Revelations 8:1 and brother around said
[1:09:23] that's a scene. Right. Amen.
[1:09:26] A scene means something is
[1:09:30] happening. There's not a picture.
[1:09:33] picture of something has h that has
[1:09:34] happened a scene is something going
[1:09:39] on you see why I kept driving at it that
[1:09:42] lamb it couldn't be a line that lamb
[1:09:45] come forth and was crucified at Calvary
[1:09:48] that lamb that's come down through seven
[1:09:50] church ages that's right
[1:09:53] that lamb is still on the mercy
[1:09:56] seat right sir
[1:09:59] for you and Yeah.
[1:10:02] The axe of a
[1:10:06] play. The acts of a
[1:10:09] play around says that this chapter 5 is
[1:10:13] the most sublime scripture there is in
[1:10:15] the Bible. Amen. Yes, sir.
[1:10:19] I gave that to you the other day. 238 to
[1:10:22] the
[1:10:25] breach. You get the first one.
[1:10:33] Paragraph 92, Revelation chapter
[1:10:35] 5. He said, "This is the greatest
[1:10:38] chapter of all the book of Revelations."
[1:10:42] Amen.
[1:10:43] Chapter
[1:10:45] 5 is the greatest chapter. The most
[1:10:49] sublime thoughts that could ever be in
[1:10:51] the
[1:10:52] scriptures is to see what God
[1:10:55] taught of a
[1:11:00] people. Right.
[1:11:06] Right. Let me just cut the rest of
[1:11:12] it. Pull it up, brother Joe. what we
[1:11:16] talked
[1:11:17] about Revelations
[1:11:25] 5. All
[1:11:27] right. Now, remember the next one. Don't
[1:11:29] put it up
[1:11:31] yet. I'm going to use this
[1:11:36] one. I'm not going to get into what
[1:11:38] tonight. It'll be more Sunday.
[1:11:42] But look what he says in Revelations 5 6
[1:11:44] and 7. And behold, and lo, in the midst
[1:11:47] of the
[1:11:49] throne, and of the four beasts, in the
[1:11:52] midst of the elders,
[1:11:55] stood a lamb as it had been slain. Amen.
[1:12:00] Having seven horns and seven
[1:12:04] eyes, which is the spirit of God in
[1:12:08] seven church ages. Right. Right.
[1:12:12] And he came and took the book out of the
[1:12:14] right hand of him that sat upon the
[1:12:18] throne. Acts of a
[1:12:20] play. And what did he do? He climbed up
[1:12:24] on the throne and sat down. Amen. That's
[1:12:26] right. See, we think he come and took
[1:12:28] the book out of the hand on the throne
[1:12:29] and just No. No. He climbed up on the
[1:12:30] throne and sat down. That's right.
[1:12:31] That's right. That's right. Because he's
[1:12:33] got to stay on the throne till
[1:12:34] redemption's over. Right.
[1:12:38] What about a beautiful scene to see the
[1:12:41] bride of Christ that we read there a
[1:12:43] while ago that's seven horns and seven
[1:12:46] eyes is dealing with Christ and his
[1:12:49] bride.
[1:12:52] She's the one that gives birth to the
[1:12:54] word.
[1:12:57] The word your prophet brought has to be
[1:13:01] birthed. She is to be delivered. I'm
[1:13:03] quoting from Sunday of a new birth from
[1:13:05] according to Malachi
[1:13:07] 4. Well, Malachi 4's brother random he
[1:13:10] said the bride is to to give
[1:13:13] birth a birth of the word.
[1:13:22] What a beautiful scene to see what God
[1:13:25] thinks of you and I.
[1:13:26] Amen. that he puts us right on the
[1:13:29] throne with
[1:13:30] him. When he climbs up on that throne
[1:13:33] and sits down, he's on the throne of
[1:13:35] your
[1:13:37] heart. As he climbed up there and sat
[1:13:39] down yet,
[1:13:41] cuz we know in Revelation that's what
[1:13:43] he's, you know, we know up in heaven,
[1:13:45] that's what he'd already done, right?
[1:13:50] And he's waiting in heaven for us to
[1:13:52] manifest on earth. What he was what he's
[1:13:54] doing there to become the word made
[1:13:58] flesh. The fully matured word is not
[1:14:01] going to go to the ground this time.
[1:14:02] It's going up. Amen. All right. Let's
[1:14:05] take one more look at
[1:14:07] him. Let's take one more look at him and
[1:14:10] her. Go ahead, brother
[1:14:12] Joe. Revelations 1.
[1:14:18] Now look what he says. And I turned to
[1:14:20] see the voice that spake with
[1:14:22] me. And being turned, I saw seven golden
[1:14:26] candlesticks, horns, and
[1:14:28] eyes. And in the midst of the
[1:14:30] candlesticks, seven candlesticks, one
[1:14:33] light unto the son of
[1:14:36] man, glow with a garment down to the
[1:14:38] foot, and g about the
[1:14:40] pouch with a golden
[1:14:42] girdle. How many times have I preached
[1:14:44] on that? Perhaps it's
[1:14:47] feminish. That's not a masculine form.
[1:14:50] That's a feminist form. Amen.
[1:14:58] Huh? Go to number
[1:15:01] 11. We'll take this and
[1:15:06] quit. Why we are not a denomination. 58
[1:15:09] 9:27 paragraph 180. Now, if you notice
[1:15:12] in Revelation 1, we find Jesus standing
[1:15:15] in the seven church ages, the seven
[1:15:18] golden candlesticks. When he turned and
[1:15:20] saw one like the son of man standing
[1:15:23] clothed with a how was it? It was a
[1:15:26] bride standing in the
[1:15:29] candlesticks drawn out. Amen.
[1:15:34] Same
[1:15:36] picture from Revelations 1. Yep. to
[1:15:40] Revelations
[1:15:45] 5. And I wasn't the one that wrote the
[1:15:47] book, but I'll sure give you the quote
[1:15:51] later. He said, Revelations
[1:15:55] 10:1, standing with one foot on land and
[1:15:57] one on
[1:16:01] sea. He said that was the same as
[1:16:04] Revelations
[1:16:06] 1. I can find you that in a hurry,
[1:16:08] probably. They'll probably find it time
[1:16:10] we get through and put it up
[1:16:14] there. Shows the same. Revelations one
[1:16:18] shows Jesus Christ in his
[1:16:21] bride full
[1:16:24] manifestation. Revelations 5 shows Jesus
[1:16:27] Christ in his bride in a full
[1:16:30] manifestation of a lamb of God.
[1:16:34] Revelations 10:7 shows the line or 101
[1:16:39] shows the line and his
[1:16:43] bride.
[1:16:46] Right. Can you find it, brother
[1:16:48] Joe? Let's see if I can get Revelation
[1:16:51] 10. I can tell you where it's
[1:16:56] at. Somebody might remember it right
[1:16:59] off. I've used it enough.
[1:17:04] Revelations
[1:17:05] 10. All right. Be paid 7274 the seal
[1:17:13] book
[1:17:15] which that's probably the old seal
[1:17:17] [Applause]
[1:17:19] book. We'll have to translate that over.
[1:17:21] But that's enough. You know it. If you
[1:17:23] don't, I'll be glad to give it to you.
[1:17:25] He said Revelations 1. Revelations 10:1
[1:17:29] is the same as Revelations
[1:17:33] 13. But see, we want to make it some
[1:17:35] kind of a great something around them in
[1:17:38] the things. All right, you got
[1:17:42] it. I was thinking it was in the steel
[1:17:44] book, but it's not. It's in Revelation 4
[1:17:48] part 1 60 1912 31. The voice was the
[1:17:54] same voice that walked in the seven
[1:17:55] golden candlestick. Same voice. The
[1:17:58] voice didn't change, but the voice work
[1:18:00] was it when he heard it the first time.
[1:18:03] How many remembers in the first church
[1:18:05] age behind him? I was in the spirit on
[1:18:08] the Lord's day. Revelations 1 the 10 in
[1:18:12] the spirit. If you want to put that
[1:18:13] down, Revelations 1:10. I was in the
[1:18:15] spirit on the Lord's. That's still not
[1:18:17] the one cuz he was standing in the midst
[1:18:19] cuz he said it's the same as
[1:18:20] Revelations. I'll give it to you later.
[1:18:22] Don't worry about
[1:18:24] it. It's on page 72 and 74 of the old
[1:18:28] seal book. But just think about
[1:18:31] it. You and I have got to give
[1:18:36] birth to the word. That's
[1:18:40] good. That's a wonderful situation to
[1:18:43] give birth to the
[1:18:47] word. But see, that's not all the story.
[1:18:51] We must become the word made flesh.
[1:18:54] Right? That's what God is waiting on.
[1:18:59] He's waiting on us to bring forth a
[1:19:02] lamb. In other words, he's waiting on
[1:19:05] time to where the bride can become the
[1:19:09] word, the word made flesh, and she can
[1:19:13] stand up on the earth and not be caught
[1:19:14] up with all these doctrines and ideas
[1:19:17] and things running about the people of
[1:19:19] the message.
[1:19:22] you know, two soul, seven thunder
[1:19:23] virtue, perusia, river Jordan, all kind
[1:19:25] of things.
[1:19:29] It ain't going to be a denominational
[1:19:31] bride. Amen. Going to be a word born
[1:19:34] bride. Amen.
[1:19:36] Only the word born bride can give birth
[1:19:38] to the word. Right. Only the word born
[1:19:42] bride can be the word.
[1:19:46] That's why in 1969 in Athens, Georgia, I
[1:19:49] preached the message that in the end
[1:19:51] time, the bride of Jesus Christ would
[1:19:55] be decent of man.
[1:20:00] Amen. I still believe it more today than
[1:20:03] I ever have. Got a whole lot more
[1:20:04] mechanics to go with it. Right.
[1:20:07] But I've already showed
[1:20:09] you that was the first sermon I preached
[1:20:12] right here with all the quotes from
[1:20:13] brother
[1:20:15] Brown. The bride of Jesus Christ must be
[1:20:18] the word made flesh. The word made flesh
[1:20:20] is the son of
[1:20:22] man. You see, we only want to stop with
[1:20:24] brother Brown being. He's not the son of
[1:20:26] man. He was a son of man.
[1:20:28] The son of man is the Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:20:31] Right. But when you begin to see it like
[1:20:33] that and see it up in glory, the seven
[1:20:35] horns and the seven eyes home to the
[1:20:42] lamb. It's not you trying to type
[1:20:45] something. You are that.
[1:20:49] Partial realization must become perfect
[1:20:51] realization. Amen.
[1:20:56] You say, "Yeah, but that's just making
[1:20:57] too much." Cuz I I'm trying to get the
[1:20:59] idea that maybe you're saying that we
[1:21:01] are the lamb. No. And he's the lamb.
[1:21:03] That's right. We're the seven horns and
[1:21:05] seven eyes. But they're sitting on the
[1:21:08] lamb's head. And the lamb without the
[1:21:11] horns couldn't take the book.
[1:21:16] Come on. Amen. But the lamb with the
[1:21:19] seven horns and seven
[1:21:21] eyes can take the book. Right.
[1:21:27] Why? Because the book's finished.
[1:21:31] He's the same yesterday, today, and
[1:21:33] forever. Amen. Come on,
[1:21:35] brother. Think on these
[1:21:40] things. Hebrews 11:40, they without us
[1:21:43] cannot be made
[1:21:47] complete. Right? Word perfect is
[1:21:50] complete.
[1:21:54] You know, even those that are in glory
[1:21:57] today are groaning. I had a bunch more
[1:22:00] to bring, but
[1:22:01] I cuz they're wanting to be back here in
[1:22:04] their earthly
[1:22:07] bodies. Romans
[1:22:11] 8:23, 24 right through 22, 23. What is
[1:22:14] it? The world is waiting for the
[1:22:16] manifestation of the sons and daughters
[1:22:18] of God. And you know, then we're
[1:22:20] groaning,
[1:22:22] waiting to to
[1:22:24] wit to
[1:22:28] understand the plan of redemption.
[1:22:34] We're groaning for that. Amen.
[1:22:38] Every prayer I pray, I said,
[1:22:40] "God, reveal your word."
[1:22:43] Amen.
[1:22:44] Open your word that we can see
[1:22:50] Let me have the ability to preach it so
[1:22:51] the people can see
[1:22:53] it. The prophet of God said when the
[1:22:55] bride realizes who she is
[1:23:00] and what she's doing
[1:23:02] here, she'll be gone.
[1:23:07] I believe that I'm the bride of Christ,
[1:23:09] but I really don't know whether I'm
[1:23:10] going to make her change or not. Why?
[1:23:12] What's your problem?
[1:23:15] Well, I'm getting older. What's your
[1:23:21] problem? Read the other day where
[1:23:23] somebody was 114 years
[1:23:27] old. That means I got something like
[1:23:30] what 30, 40, two more years to go.
[1:23:38] What about it?
[1:23:42] You know, one statement I know of
[1:23:43] brother Brandham that I
[1:23:46] love, he said the biggest portion of the
[1:23:49] Old Testament scriptures of prophecy was
[1:23:52] fulfilled. Do you remember where? That's
[1:23:55] right. On the last hours that he was
[1:23:59] hanging on a tree. Right.
[1:24:02] The biggest portion of the scriptures
[1:24:04] was fulfilled the last hours he was
[1:24:07] hanging on a tree. Amen.
[1:24:10] What about it? Can you see yourself?
[1:24:14] Seven horns and seven
[1:24:17] eyes. The spirit of God down through
[1:24:20] seven church ages. And you see, he
[1:24:23] couldn't come forth and make it manifest
[1:24:25] with six horns. You know, got to be
[1:24:29] seven
[1:24:30] horns, seven eyes.
[1:24:34] Got to be the bride of Jesus Christ
[1:24:35] standing in the midst of the seven
[1:24:36] golden candlestick like unto the son of
[1:24:39] man. It does say the son of man stand
[1:24:40] says like unto the son of man. G about
[1:24:42] the
[1:24:44] ps in his
[1:24:47] form the wonderful bride of Jesus
[1:24:52] Christ. Will your revelation produce a
[1:24:57] lamb? Now you understand what I'm
[1:25:00] saying. So I could spend the rest of the
[1:25:02] night talking on that one
[1:25:08] talk. We
[1:25:12] illustrations say that they would take
[1:25:13] the Bible and they would would take it
[1:25:15] apart and give it out. I would and give
[1:25:18] the pages out of the Bible to each
[1:25:21] one. I said now what you got to do is
[1:25:24] you got to memorize that, you know, and
[1:25:28] then destroy it.
[1:25:31] But one of these days, we're going to
[1:25:32] come back
[1:25:33] together. And if you're not able to
[1:25:37] bring your portion of the scripture
[1:25:39] back, then we will not be able to unlock
[1:25:43] the key. Thank you. That's right. Right.
[1:25:46] Right.
[1:25:49] We're all dependent upon the fact that
[1:25:51] every one of us has got to be able to
[1:25:54] remember. Now, I'm just giving that as
[1:25:56] an illustration, right?
[1:25:58] But I'm the worst one with a memory in
[1:26:00] the building. So, you know, I'm have it
[1:26:05] illustrated. But you see, without our
[1:26:07] part, the book is not complete.
[1:26:13] You say, "But I don't have anything to
[1:26:15] do other than sit in a pew." That's what
[1:26:17] we're here for. Got to be somebody for
[1:26:19] me to preach to. That's right.
[1:26:25] Give it all I can do. Sell
[1:26:28] cars.
[1:26:30] Well, it makes a living for a lot of
[1:26:32] people.
[1:26:34] That's right. Yes, sir.
[1:26:38] What about it?
[1:26:40] And you see your part. Right.
[1:26:43] Now, if he's not complete without us,
[1:26:46] then we got to have our part complete.
[1:26:48] True.
[1:26:52] So if it's just a
[1:26:53] housewife, what it's supposed to be a
[1:26:58] housewife? That's where we're trying to
[1:27:00] figure out somebody else's position.
[1:27:02] Is that what the prophet said on
[1:27:04] adoption? He said it's not for us to
[1:27:06] figure out those things. He said it's to
[1:27:08] be what we're supposed to be.
[1:27:15] Ain't no way to figure this thing out.
[1:27:16] It's got to be revealed. Right.
[1:27:21] And you're part of the book. That's
[1:27:23] right.
[1:27:25] And you're being revealed.
[1:27:29] Do you know
[1:27:30] yourself? If most of you that have been
[1:27:33] here any amount of
[1:27:34] time, that's the thing that I've always
[1:27:37] tried to do is to get you to see who you
[1:27:40] are. Not to see who I am, right? And
[1:27:45] gifts and signs and wonders. Well, we
[1:27:47] believe Brother Dale because of this,
[1:27:48] that, and the other. Well, then don't do
[1:27:50] that. You're not doing no good. That's
[1:27:53] right. It's when he reveals himself to
[1:27:55] you, then you are becoming what I'm
[1:27:57] preaching.
[1:28:04] We listen to a man Sunday and I believe
[1:28:07] him. Talked about tattoos disappearing
[1:28:11] off of people's arm. Right.
[1:28:16] Yeah. I don't really know about
[1:28:20] that. Now, the reason you don't know
[1:28:22] about it because you don't have an
[1:28:23] experience.
[1:28:29] This is my experience,
[1:28:32] church. A long time ago, a man, and I'm
[1:28:34] not throwing off on him. I'm just making
[1:28:36] a point. A long time ago, a man preached
[1:28:39] for quite a while that he was going to
[1:28:41] kill a world record deer.
[1:28:48] One day he spoke and he said there's a
[1:28:50] possibility there may be another one.
[1:28:52] These are direct quotes coming from word
[1:28:57] of you know what I told
[1:29:00] him? I said if you can believe what I'm
[1:29:02] trying to preach I'll give you the
[1:29:04] second
[1:29:13] one. So, you're supposed to put her
[1:29:15] faith out.
[1:29:19] Why can't we speak our faith?
[1:29:22] Well, brother, you going to get See,
[1:29:24] that's what you're trying to figure
[1:29:27] out. I was just telling it how it
[1:29:31] was. If you believe God, he'll give you
[1:29:34] the desire of your heart. That's Bible.
[1:29:38] You better be careful cuz you might not
[1:29:41] want what you get.
[1:29:44] But he'll give you the desire of your
[1:29:45] heart. That's right. Amen. If you
[1:29:47] believe it. That's right. That's where
[1:29:50] the trouble will most people. They can't
[1:29:52] believe for their families.
[1:29:54] They believe for their family if it
[1:29:56] walks down the altar and standing cry.
[1:29:58] Oh yes. Oh yes. But what about believing
[1:30:01] for them when they're going worse and
[1:30:02] worse and worse and worse in the world?
[1:30:04] That's right. That's right.
[1:30:10] Why not stand up and say it? Amen.
[1:30:14] I told you way would be
[1:30:19] here. And I kept saying
[1:30:22] it. And I said then just like I'm saying
[1:30:24] now, I don't care whether you believe it
[1:30:25] or not cuz he didn't speak to you. I
[1:30:28] don't expect you to believe. He spoke to
[1:30:30] me.
[1:30:32] Well, you know, one day it came and I
[1:30:35] told you again. I
[1:30:37] said I was wouldn't even let my wife
[1:30:40] tell him because I didn't want to have
[1:30:42] anything to do with his
[1:30:44] calling. And I told my wife, I said,
[1:30:46] "Not only has he told me Wade's coming
[1:30:47] back, this is before Wade came back." I
[1:30:49] said, "Wade going to be preaching in the
[1:30:51] pool pit. You'll be preaching Sunday
[1:30:55] afternoon cuz we're going over to meet
[1:30:58] and back.
[1:31:04] Why don't you speak what you believe?
[1:31:08] You know the Lord might be waiting on
[1:31:10] you. That's right.
[1:31:16] Any problem with
[1:31:24] that? Joyce was pray for
[1:31:27] Daniel. I said, "Don't worry about it.
[1:31:33] Just quit worrying about it. That's
[1:31:35] right. He'll be here.
[1:31:41] Won't you say
[1:31:43] it? What if it don't come to
[1:31:46] pass? I got enough sense knowing God
[1:31:48] didn't say it. But if it comes to I got
[1:31:51] enough sense to know I didn't say it.
[1:31:54] Right. I got enough sense to know I
[1:31:56] didn't say it.
[1:32:02] But, Brother Dale, you're a preacher.
[1:32:04] What's that difference? That's right.
[1:32:06] That's right.
[1:32:08] You are the book I'm talking about.
[1:32:13] You're the book in the hand of the one
[1:32:15] sitting on the
[1:32:17] throne. Cuz you and God have become one.
[1:32:20] Let's stand together. We got Let's try
[1:32:23] 223 in the red book. 223 in the red
[1:32:26] book. Anybody have a need?

[1:36:20] Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat.
[1:36:41] for anybody
[1:36:45] else
[1:36:50] wondered about
[1:36:53] it. Everything was wonderful. All
[1:36:58] one
[1:37:00] experience I said one day out you don't
[1:37:03] have my hands you break out still
[1:37:08] great she said Sam said your hands are
[1:37:13] really
[1:37:15] good they're not broken at
[1:37:18] all he le three
[1:37:23] days you justifying what you do. You get
[1:37:27] mad. He said, "I'm going to make
[1:37:31] you. I'm going to show you your
[1:37:35] life. I'm going to make it work." You
[1:37:37] know what God said? Make it
[1:37:41] work. You'll see her testimony
[1:37:49] right on his
[1:38:01] right. Heat. Heat. Heat.
[1:38:25] Wonder just got an email from Gary CR.
[1:38:29] He's been sick for two days and Sister
[1:38:32] Julie said he wasn't able to come to go
[1:38:34] to work today and for us to keep him in
[1:38:37] our prayers. His stomach's acting up and
[1:38:39] he has had a violent fever, raging fever
[1:38:42] and violent chills for the past two
[1:38:44] days. Been better, but we still need to
[1:38:46] pray for him. Anybody hear that? Brother
[1:38:48] Gary France is real sick and needs us to
[1:38:51] pray for him that the Lord would touch
[1:38:53] him and deliver him from these things
[1:38:55] that's bothering him, a high fever and
[1:38:57] shields and everything else. So, let's
[1:38:59] just believe it and pray, right?
[1:39:01] And just ask the Lord to make his work
[1:39:04] and be right. Father,
[1:39:08] your our brother sent a word, Lord, for
[1:39:10] us to pray for him.
[1:39:13] We just ask you to come on the scene
[1:39:16] now.
[1:39:17] Go there and take away that pain and the
[1:39:20] agony.
[1:39:22] Take away the
[1:39:23] fever. Take away all of what's causing
[1:39:26] it.
[1:39:28] Because we know what Satan's doing. He's
[1:39:31] hindered in every form.
[1:39:33] for our brother not to be able to go to
[1:39:34] work, he must be really sick. And we've
[1:39:37] known him a long time and know that he
[1:39:39] works when he's feeling
[1:39:40] bad. But we just ask you, Lord, to honor
[1:39:44] his faith, to send a word for us, and to
[1:39:48] honor our faith to believe that you are
[1:39:49] the healer. You're the savior. You're
[1:39:52] the redeemer. You're the all and all in
[1:39:56] Jesus, Lord, is your name. Thank you for
[1:39:58] healing. We'll get a report back. It all
[1:40:00] is well, Lord. We love you.
[1:40:03] right here. Anybody else have a need
[1:40:04] before we go?
[1:40:08] Remember now, if you're going to try to
[1:40:10] all go together, whatever to the
[1:40:12] fellowship meeting, uh, make sure you
[1:40:15] let us know where we can make
[1:40:17] arrangements for vehicles and things.
[1:40:20] We'll be leaving at Wade's house at
[1:40:22] about
[1:40:23] 10:00 and that way then we have to have
[1:40:25] time going up there because it's a long
[1:40:27] ways up and everything to to get there.
[1:40:30] So, we don't want to push time and all
[1:40:32] like that. We try to to do as best we
[1:40:35] can. All right. Anything else before we
[1:40:38] go, brother Boyd? On my way to church
[1:40:40] this evening, there's a head-on
[1:40:42] collision right there by our house and I
[1:40:45] heard that there were minor injuries,
[1:40:47] but you know, I pray for those families,
[1:40:49] maybe someone we know, maybe family.
[1:40:52] Yeah, there's a tractor trailer in a
[1:40:54] car.
[1:40:57] Just remember that. Anybody else
[1:41:02] need? Father, we thank you for tonight
[1:41:05] and we pray that what we said is
[1:41:08] worthy. The Lord, this would be the
[1:41:10] least to say we've tried the best we
[1:41:13] could. That would be very
[1:41:16] much. But yet, we know a God that can
[1:41:18] take words,
[1:41:20] change them, fit them together, and make
[1:41:22] them to be what they're supposed to be,
[1:41:24] and reveal yourself unto us. We love you
[1:41:27] and we thank you. We ask you as we go on
[1:41:29] our way home that you'd help us to
[1:41:31] remember these things. And Father, just
[1:41:34] take care of everybody. Give us safe
[1:41:35] journey. May your love be made manifest
[1:41:37] in our hearts and lives. We love you and
[1:41:40] we thank you in Jesus
[1:41:42] name. You dismiss. This is
[1:41:49] the
[1:41:51] time. It's better than you think. Heat.
[1:42:06] Heat. Heat. Heat.
[1:42:27] Darkness.
[1:42:32] This world is not
[1:42:41] understanding
[1:42:45] God. He would
[1:42:49] be
[1:42:55] following the
[1:42:59] word.
[1:43:03] Yeah. Heat.
