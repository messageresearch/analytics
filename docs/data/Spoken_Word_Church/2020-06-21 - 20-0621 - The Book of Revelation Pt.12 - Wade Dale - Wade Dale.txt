========================================

three we've got full house I'm already a little set up if they come in around the little bit back there back so well we're we're speaking on the book of Revelation we went through chapter one two and three we just want the bride in its fullness and then we saw the last church age which was Laodicea and in the Lausanne Church age we see that that's the church age were him and the church age does not end remember hmm it does for us but it will not end until we come over past the Millennium if I got that because millennium it's gonna be in time there will be a seventh day millennium everybody got that yeah because you and I in typing we must have a eight today we're gonna talk about then when we get into these feast days you have an eighth day well the eighth day is the future home because that's eternity faith which is your symbol like this with no beginning and no end but it won't turn it like this it makes it page 7 is completion but time is going to continue on for at least another thousand years after we leave actually a thousand years three and half years that doesn't matter to us because today if you're born again Paul was born again he become an eight and eight and they and they and they that's why the prophet of God said that the bride never was in the church age now you take that literally he was not right but if you take it spiritually literally we're in Laodicea and we have all of the spirits of layout of sealed we have all the things we have to get through but in you're born again you're in an eighth day you're you're already eternal so that's why when we come back into millennium we're just going to be eternal people right here when we take a body change it'll make this thing an eight-day but now for right now sorry to tell you this is still in the old seventh day which is morning the evening as both Elise was talking about you know you come into the Riu regular days but now remember when we get to this eighth day future home bible says them need no life being the city why because we'll be glowing it's like we were talking about hmm Eloisa turned out wonderfully Wednesday is that when God said let there be light see the devil didn't put it out you just put a shield up in front of it called sin and we've had to deal with that all the way to where because remember the light inside here can be put out but when we come to this future home we will need light because you and I'll all be be light not hey like Satan can be a light don't remember instance he's he's sure he's a demon of darkness but he likes to become the light because the Bible said Jesus told the disciples Pharisees he said in that light in you be darkness how great is that darkness they thought they had like they were dark the world thinks to have light people this world you know litters think they're invincible they I'm gonna light their in darkness and you and I are in darkness unless you born again but when you born again you come up into an eighth day so here we see in chapter four it says after this in other words after the church ages behold a door now who is the door Jesus Christ is disorder alright good the door was opened in heaven now remember we're all under an open book open in heaven hi and the first voice which I heard was as it were of a trumpet talking to Mina what is a trumpet is a message and denote something going forth all right talking to who me so that's why the rapture is a revelation that's God talking to you when you get born again God has said I'm talking to you and you have been born again I'm talking to you now I'm going to use a five fold ministry I'm gonna use a layout team to speak to you but it's me talking to you because I didn't say the sound of a trumpet talking to them it's not a bunch of denominations and not a bunch of this is how the other it's him it's God Almighty talking to you which said come up hither and every time we come to church over time we do press play and all the different things that we do as far as my full ministry and listening to the Prophet that's what should be is not a message of good will and good cheer and how to live on the earth which has got something to do with it while they're in our earthly journey but brother bill every morning and brother branham and on any of these ministers release enough they're telling you as soon as they open their mouth that should become a pillar because we're trying to get up out of this thing so that's John is the top of the whole bride and he hears the voice that says come up hither and I will show thee things which must be Hereafter so in other words he's going to give you a revelation that's not just gonna birthed you into his body and then say I think for yourself no that's why we've been on this journey of a Christian for a long time and we're still even in these feast days we're going to be talking about the journey of a Christian because you have a spiritual journey just like Israel had a natural journey just like Abram and Abraham Journey Ruth and Esther had a natural journey that they went through to help you that you can read in the Bible say man I went through that right there I'm going through this right here let's see what extra set of Madilyn c13 so it's a Bible sit down write to show thee things which must be Hereafter now obviously he was in the spirit lift it up and after almost a heaven in 3 set on the throne 1 so the greatest revelation you can ever have is one true and living God and that that same God created the world created you and burped you died for you rose for you came back on heard that Pentagon for you and he's sitting on what's wrong oh oh brother he's up there somewhere and he's got this great big ugly throne no he's sittin in your throne he's either sitting in the throne room or one to get in your throne room alright so immediately I was in the spirit are caught up in the spirit because remember nope you got to see revelations is in layers right even your revelation is in layers you get a revelation 1 through Lynn with God and then you hear a few things like brother weeks is bringing out a couple playing win tonight I then I had it's not that I didn't see it that way it's just to die never saying it that way good y'all need to tell these people like like I said before if a preacher says all I don't need recognition then he's a liar even brother branham said that the brown said that man was a liar he said I like somebody pat me on the back then I did so anyway go for him again and if it was God speaking to you then he just got out of the way and let God speak so what a gift that's to me that's the greatest gift in the world if you get out of the way let God do the work so behold a throne was set in heaven and one sat on the throne now this is a look at me this is natural John John natural John is writing remember when he said way back over there right what you see right right what you see John and send it to the churches heard behind me a great voice as of a trumpet verse 10 hello verse 19 write the things which you see and the things which are and the things which shall be Hereafter because John's fixing to right after after chapter or not after chapter 4 but in chapter 4 he is writing things that have not happened yet on this physical earth if I got that say man on the physical earth but when John was caught up he was like brother branham like in the Eagle age he was caught up and he could see and so all the way to this right here all the way in this 8th day man that's why John rejoice that's why you can you can hear nothing but John yelling you think I'm loud all haven't heard John when he screamed I saw his name in the book and saw this whole plan of redemption coming in coming into view just the one man John and he says write the things which thou say the mystery of the Seven Stars and the Seven golden candlesticks the seven stars are the angels we understand that so we went to the church ages and here's the door in heaven Amina Helen in the spirit behold a throne was set in heaven and one sat on the throne now this is what we have to prove from this point forward you got a think we're looking at a natural scene and then we've got to look at something happens in the spirit a spiritual scene ok if I got that because when we're this is what confuses most people in the message is this quote and I'll probably try to bring it next Sunday if we're brother Adam says that the bride goes up in chapter 4:1 and it's not seen until revelations 19 well they it just throws everybody into a tizzy all this revelation in between that is not even for us well no it's not but yes it is just right we're not going to naturally be here when the plates well we're not going to naturally be here when these things some of these things happened everybody got that revelation chapter 13 window when the United States beats for the beach we better not be here all right so all but it has symbols and it has a revelation in there because we got to get caught up in the spirit not into the natural thing because I'm gonna throw you a little loop here if I ready come on brother jokes didn't know he's not ready you ready man okay great a man hi revelations 10 1 through 6 it's not to it we're gone I just told you were gone I'm in Revelations for one look for one we go up and come across and here's revelations 19 when we come back riding in the Millennium Ram we're not here this is to the Jews because what's going to happen in Revelations 10 1 they're going to get the literal body angel through two prophets are going to go to Israel and preach to them and bring a people out but then you bring in and interject revelations 10 you should all I stopped at 7 because that's 7 Turk ages and this is still a church a but on chapter 10 verse 4 6 I mean verse 7 you bring in but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel these things back to revelations for will be made known now remember made known by prophecy the brother Branham prophesied one off this thing everybody got that right so now we can see their revelations 10 1 through 6 is the mighty angel coming to see us don't do away with that that mighty angel did come down from heaven this standing from heaven with a shout what's up an archangel that's why it is confusing if you can't read a book of Revelation then I mean if you can't understand the book of Revelation go back to this right here revelation 4 is a scene in heaven alright it's not gonna happen on the earth John's caught up the relations for and revelations 5 everybody got that revelations 5 is the scene in heaven it's the scene that's eternal because it goes all the way back from the Redeemer all the way to where we are kings and priests and where we came to 300 here okay see we're not we're not that here we're gonna see that in our feast days way down the road that we're not kings and priests right here right the thousand-year millennium is to the Jews so that Christ can rule and reign on the throne the twelve we don't ring we don't have anything to do with twelve products we don't even know no I mean sure listen we don't know how to rule Jewish rule if I got that just like the temple we could you go over there right now build the temple no but I'll guarantee there's some Orthodox Jews over there that could go over there and tell you how the whole dimensions from memory the whole dimensions were to put the pot where to put the Labrador to put the Holy of Holies where but we can't why because it's not to us we put all that in here in our temple right it's not pots and pans and these days this we're fixing to talk about but God give them feast days to honor him because we're gonna Street it this afternoon they're not Israel's feet no we're no Bible it talks about Israel's feast every time God mentions it he said they're my fee yeah they're my feet they're mine I'm gonna allow you into my feet and then this is what you're gonna do a man comes remember but now see us is Gentiles think about this them as Jews even back through here if they didn't receive the Holy Ghost a lot of these Jews are going to be given eternal life you got your fifth seal Jude you've got all these different kind of Jews that are that go all the way back to Jesus's time you stay June yeah Nicodemus Brown said Nicodemus and go man you will be given eternal life for what Nocturna Christ down but they didn't accept him code at one time so there's a place for these Jews in the Bible so that's why you've got the Old Testament and that's why you've got this Revelation chapter four and five because remember you're going to get in Revelation six there's your seals we get the spiritual part of the seals now we don't get to the natural part of the sea we get the spiritual part so we're in the spiritual point here and we'll go through that as we go along but just keep remembering two things in your mind this is to the natural Jew or on what I would say is 144,000 mm-hmm because we're going to read in here several places in Revelation 7 or somewhere in there where it says they sang a new song that no one can sing but them right why because our redemption is different than their Redemption yeah yeah it is our Redemption is different to a degrees the same Holy Ghost but we perceive it as Gentiles here they're receiving it while we're gone and they're not bright anymore Christ put them away they're not pride but they do have a place that's why I've got put in the word 144,000 would be saved 12,000 from each tribe would be saved because God's not going to forget Israel listen it looks like sometimes that God just forgot Israel when he come on the day of Pentecost he just forgot natural Israel he never forgot naturally even they continue on today the old or thought should you continue to do sacrifices they continue to do but they just don't have everything in place yet so now as we see this revelations for one we go up and then in revelations 19 the bride comes back because we have to go somewhere to let all this happened naturally on earth some stuff tell us like I said it's not to the bride the bride doesn't have a feast day and the bride doesn't have a holy convocation as they have one house is spiritual we celebrate the feast days and our new birth you went through these stages of even the seven feast days because remember there's only there's only justification think kissing baptism goes but you got the four full restoration and then we talked about the other day going up the statue of perfect man again not again you don't want to mean but you justified it hey justify saying five baptism holy goat then you start going through the same thing again right that's the case of that getting baptism holding up and you get up here in the headstone the real you didn't do it you're sanctified completely and then you've become the bride complete the total headship of Christ and which Christ is the head guess what when the head the head tells you what to do the head tells the whole body what to do and that's what we're heading toward and heading to is that great point to where we now remember because when we come back were what were or we ride over here this is the bride but I hear she's the wife I'm a tour so let's get into this remember but then don't say well that's nothing applied to me you make sure every part of the Bible don't ever kick any part of the Bible out cuz it applies to you yeah but maybe it don't apply to you naturally nobody got that that's right alright so the bride goes up in Revelations for one and John tops the bride but see you and I get to look at this scene watch this thing right here and he that set was to look upon like Jasper and sardine stone there was a rainbow around the throne in sight like an emerald now brother Brown tells us that all we see on natural earth is what we see half a rainbow because the coven that's not totally fulfilled yet if I got that understand that then you look it up in a church a book you ready to turn to a book you read that because you get a half but when he's sitting on this throne when we're caught up it says round about the throne in other words completion insight like an emerald now we're brother round talking about that life being an emerald life it was a round light why because God and eternal God's eternal name when he connects us together guess what thanks you're eight alright just a little symbols to look at and round about the throne were four and 20 seats aren't here is your seat for 24 people oh my god that 24 people and upon the seats I saw four and 20 elders sitting clothed in white raiment and they had on their heads crowns of gold now remember what are these 24 people they are twelve patriarchs in the Old Testament and your Twelve Apostles in the New Testament so John was one of them right so John in simple I John saw itself sitting there and nod he said it is 23 and I'm number 24 he said there's 24 seats he but now remember he's had a vision brother Brown saw itself in the vision when you have a vision or a dream you see yourself in it so there's no problem with it when John to look and see his self but here's my revelation of this John saw itself right here didn't you go to revelations 5 and he sees itself again because there's 24 elders there and to me by the time the end of that chapter 5 we're gonna see John that the heavens can't contain his voice why he knew he made it he knew he made it he knew he made what God had told him because remember Jesus stood on earth and he said someone among you will see me coming in power in other words at the end time so remember the thing went around they think was somebody not gonna die before they saw the Lord coming back in in the second coming but they misunderstood that he was talking directly to John but John didn't know it until I believe John went to the Isle of Patmos and that's a pretty horrible place to be but he's like man this is what Jesus was talking about right so he saw himself sitting there so his other brothers the other 12 11 apostles he saw them in James John Matthew Mark all did not work but - anyway - 12 Matthias and all the different once he saw that Peter he saw them set them and itself setting their because he's looking at a vision television right and out of the throne proceeded lightnings thunderings and voices so it wasn't a very silent place and there were seven lamps of fire burning before the throne which are the seven spirits of God now there's interchange messengers they were there okay inform inform okay they weren't there in person don't get it in your head that brother Brandon was sitting there and he knew where he was that no good you can't make pre-existence of soul brother Brown how in the world that's people don't understand it they put brother Brown I'm standing here talking to John on Patmos they make him either Mormon or Jehovah Witness right because y'all the witness believe that we were in heaven or Mormons believe we were never talking to God and the devil was sitting there right I'm actually you look it up online you want them and and they're all sitting here when it shows pictures of people sitting around the table and then then Lucifer shows his plan and it's a wonderful plan and then Jesus shows his plan and it's a better plan so God the Father except Jesus is planned anything God sends us all to earth and then the devil gets mad and he takes his people and brings them down here to get back at us now that's a doctrine so if you got brother around standing on the Isle of Patmos in in some form of theophany are they brother Brown himself is standing there you've got three distances all you got a Jehovah Witness doctrine or a more doctrine and I just don't believe that brother Brad said what were you before you were born he said you were nothing from except in the minds of dr. Amen right except in the mind of God that you were an attribute yeah but we weren't standing there watching this whole note you know why cuz John stood there watched it for us that's just I just got there I just got to him because God was that John represented the whole bride so now we can go see John see what John saw and what song what dogs off but see it took a prophet to tell us that John top the entire bride because nobody in any commentary would ever tell you that John tops the entire bride but brother Brown comes down to thank John top the entire bride because we went back and Jesus told them said something you've done it one of yous gonna stand here and see me coming in in other words the second coming and there's John standing there but now as we see and he said John right what you saw and send it to the churches why because the churches need this we need this all right and then below we can see this in simple form and see the seven spirits of God we know it was Paul all these right here forever we know it was these people but it wasn't these people it was the seven spirits that was allocated for that church ain't everybody got that right and before the throne there was a sea glass fluid right here and then we'll stop we can never get there we improve they've in the Millennium and before the throne there was a sea of glass like in the crystal in the midst of the throne and round about the throne were four beasts full of eyes before and behind the three just right here because we've been talking about the line ox Mountain Eagle explain next Sunday the first piece was the line second piece of CAF are an ox the third beats the face of a man and the fourth beast was like a flying eagle that's where you get your so what's around about the throne the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost moving around the throne we're going to remember gods and movement all the timings in movement moving around about right and what is it it's a symbol of a line simple up adopts symbol of a man and simple I'm not an eagle sitting on a limb he's flying right you can see more when you fly think you see more when you fly you feel awful when you flies to the second on top of a tree alright so we'll stop right there it's 10:00 11:00 so let's go ahead now make sure we go out this door because there's people said still sitting in the middle Trevor some dreams and new people that are here and they don't mind
