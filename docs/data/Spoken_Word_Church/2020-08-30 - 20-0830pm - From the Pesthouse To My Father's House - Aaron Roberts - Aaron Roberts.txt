eyesight and this hour by his grace so we can see him and i want to see more of him yeah amen god bless you this evening good to be in the house the lord again and i'm not gonna sing but uh may sing later but i just uh thank the lord for all his blessings on us and i want to say on behalf of our family we appreciate the church and and the prayers and the everything that was done on our behalf with the passing of dead and this is kind of y'all may think this is a little bit of a funeral service today but it may it may sound a little a little odd today but when a child of god goes home it's not a it's not a sad time it's sad for us but you know it's a celebration you know paul wrote to us in first thessalonians and he said i would not have you be ignorant brother that we should not be we should not sorrow we should sorrow not as those that have no hope you know he didn't say that you wouldn't have sorrow he said not to sorrow as those who have no hope for jesus christ we have hope we have an assurance in our in our day and god has a better place for us amen and uh like brother bob was talking about this morning starting to get leaky so we're gonna we're gonna do the best we can but uh you know it's it's a great time to realize that you know as the song uh we sing just a little while to labor just a little while to wait yeah you know you know we're just gonna be down here for a little while longer for us to struggle and walk in this path that's straight you know but you know soon that our troubles will be over you know we have that we have that promise and uh you know that's what i it's gonna it may sound a little simple today but you know what if it's real to you i tell you what it it means the world to me because we don't know how much longer we've got but i don't believe it'll be much longer but i'm looking forward to the the splendor of heaven and the glory that shall be revealed in us because there's going to be a you know we're looking for a resurrection but you know that's our that's our responsibility all the ones that run their race before us now it's our responsibility to run our race to finish the course to fight the good fight because without uh we cannot they cannot be made perfect it's all the body work and if they've done their part then it's our responsibility to do our part and that's what god's called us to do to be as as brother bob was talking about this morning it was it was very timely i thought yes because you know what it's time for us to check up on what where we're at are we walking where we need to be not just not just claiming to be a christian or not a message a believer but are you walking in the path that god has called you are you walking in the light that god has called you to are you walking in the fullness that god has for you amen we need to lay aside every weight and everything that so easily besets us and run this race as god has set before us i just appreciate this morning's word brother bob it was it was good but uh before we get into all in the scripture and everything and look at these things let's just all bow our heads and speak to the author our gracious heavenly father lord jesus we thank you for this day lord that you've given us another opportunity to be in your house lord lord father another opportunity to look into your scripture lord to open the words the pages of this book lord anybody as the prophet said any any person can open this book and read the words their own but it takes the holy spirit to come and speak to each one lord to come and take take these words that are written in a book and lord the notes that we have and different things lord lord but touch the people lord to feed their souls lord lord give comfort and lord i just pray today that you'll just come help me get out of the way lord that we can speak to you can speak to the people lord it's following my lot lord to stand here and i just pray that lord i just be what you'd have me to be lord a servant lord that you can use me that today and lord we just committed all to you and lord for each one that has a need today lord we've we've read the requests and lord we've seen the uplifted hands lord you know each need each desire lord and lord you said that if if we would seek the kingdom of god first and all these things will be added unto us lord we just want to draw closer to you lord lord we want to be molded in your image lord your prophet told us lord that we have been invited to be molded into your image lord lord we want to receive that invitation lord that you come and do all the the work that you have have to do in our lives lord or matter what how painful it may be lord how hard it may be lord jesus lord if we come forth like gold lord it'll be all worth it and father we realize that it's a late hour we don't know how much time we have left lord but we just want to be faithful in all that we do hello we're just so thankful lord that we have this opportunity to gather and we just pray for the ones that can't be here today lord jesus but we pray lord that we'll all be back together but lord we realize that you said wherever two or three are gathered in your name you're in the midst lord so each one that's listening in today lord in their homes lord wherever they may be i pray that you bless them today lord just give them what they have need of lord blessed brother dale by the way as they travel the different ones lord we just commit all things to you in the name of jesus christ we pray amen we're gonna read from first corinthians chapter 15 and then we're going to read from saint john 14 it's very familiar and brother louise likes my title sometimes he said he i i come up with some pretty good ones so uh from the past house to my father's house uh that's that's brother branham actually talks about that in the message things that are to be he talks about being delivered from the past house into my father's house and so that's where i got that from first corinthians 15 verse 39 says all flesh is not the same flesh but there is one kind of flesh of man another flesh of beast another fishes and another of birds and there are also celestial bodies and bodies terrestrial but the glory of the celestial is one and the glory of the terrestrial is another there is one glory of the sun and another glory of the moon and of the glory of the stars for one glory different from another star in glory so also is the resurrection of the dead it is sown in corruption it is raised in incorruption it is only dishonor is raised in glory it is sown in weakness it is raised in power it has sown a natural body it raises a spiritual body there is a natural body and there is a spiritual body so it is written the first man adam was made a living soul the last adam was made a quickening spirit how be it that was not first which is spiritual but that which is natural and afterwards that which is spiritual the first man is of the earth earthy and the second man is of the lord from heaven as is the earth these such are sorts are they also that are earthy and as is the heavenly such are they also that are heavenly and as we have borne the image of the earth thee we shall also bear the image of the heavenly now this i say brethren that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of god neither doth corruption inherit incorruption behold i show you a mystery we shall not all sleep but we shall be changed in a moment of twinkling i at the last trump for the trumpet shall sound and the dead shall be raised incorruptable and we shall be changed for this corruptable must that's powerful for this this corruptible must put on incorruption amen and this mortal must put on immortality so when this corruptible shall have put on him in in corruption and this mortal shall have put on immortality then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written death is swallowed up in victory oh death where is thy sting o grave where is thy victory the sting of death is sin and the strength of sin is the law but thanks be to god which giveth us the victory through our lord jesus christ therefore my beloved brethren be ye steadfast unmovable always abounding is that always abounding in the work of the lord what is the work of the lord that's what god's called you to do you know it's to be faithful and even in the small things whatever god's called you to do that's all he said always abounding in the work of the lord for as much as you know that your labor is not in vain in the lord and then we go to john chapter 14. very familiar he said let not your heart be troubled you believe in god believe also in me in my father's house there are many mansions if it were not so i would have told you i go to prepare a place for you and if i go and prepare a place for you i will come again and receive you unto myself that where i am there you may be also and whether i go you know and the way you know thomas said unto him lord we know not whether thou goest and how can we know the way jesus saith unto him i am the way the truth and the life no man cometh unto the father but by me amen god bless you this evening god bless the reading of the word be seated brother in the message the identified christ of all ages brother branham says a man he knows he comes from the beyond and a dark shadowy curtain that hangs between him and where he was before he come here and he knows he must go behind that curtain and he is always wanting to know where he come from what he is and where he is going he said we have millions of books millions of volumes that's been wrote on i suppose on the subject but there is only one book and that's 66 volumes of in itself that can tell you where you are where you come from who you are and where you're going and that is the bible it's the word that tells us he tells you where you come from who you are and where you're going so that's what i want to look at because you know there's a lot of things that can be said but i i'm so thankful that god made a made provisions for us yes because you know if it hadn't been for god we wouldn't know who we are where we come from where we're going we wouldn't we would know anything but it's the grace of god that he's that he's allowed us to know these things and he spoke to us and you know as uh the different brothers have been speaking on and you know you know where did where did we come from brother dale's been speaking on that and you know that we we came from god and we're going back to god you know when when god started in the beginning you know he had attributes that he wanted to express he wanted to display his attributes and you know you and i were an attribute of god and and you know that's what we're this displaying today is is that attribute of god that he wants to be expressed in the earth and you know he said before there was anything in the earth and and it was elohim by itself yet we were part of him and you know what we've come back to that place that we where we started we're always a part of god and you know you know we know that when he began to express himself and and began to create and he began to speak these things into existence every part everything that came into existence was an expression of himself you know brother branham said that uh you know there's different different things you know brother ram said at one time he said the first thing was created you know was god himself he said one time he said the first thing that was created was light so one time the first thing that was created was angels and you know all the different things but everything that he created when he began to speak everything was that was spoken was an expression of himself and yet and then but then as he began to express and he began to create the earth and and speak the things upon the earth and it started to come as brothers has talked about you know we saw the light come and then he began to create all the things the botany life and and all the sea life and all the things that he began to express and everything that we saw was an expression of himself but he did not have this full expression of himself that he wanted until man came until he until genesis 1 26 and he said let us make man in our own image and after our likeness and the one thing that he said was he was given man was given a commission he said for us to have dominion we were given dominion over the earth we were given this dominion why because he said he was made man was made a lesser god we were given the the uh dominion over the earth to express god because we were a lesser god so we were to express god in that form on the earth and so we were he said and to subdue it and and to multiply and replenish the earth and you know all these things that god had in his in his perfect order that he had everything they had laid out just as perfect that way he wanted it done and he and he put man here and and man had control of everything that was upon the earth and everything to take place and you know adam was able to come and god put him in flesh and then he was able to uh roll over the earth and everything but you know man got away from what god had put in the place that god had put him god god gave gave man the uh free moral agency to to do as he wanted to do and you know that he was able that he got away from what god had given him and how we've gotten away from these things but yet you know brother branham was talking one time and he was talking about uh man see man and he talks about the earth and and we see how the earth acts today and you know the earth is still following the laws of god and he said he said well it's because the earth is still submissive to the will of god to the word of god it still does the same things every single day and he said man would be would be the same way if he was still submissive to the word of god but the problem is is man's got away from the word of god and they're not submissive to the will of god they're not submissive to the word of god and they wonder why things are in the condition they are but you know when god began to speak everything into existence it was a divine order that was laid out for everything and there's still a divine order in which everything is supposed to go about in this earth and the thing is if you and i still have that ability to reach out and accept and see what the divine order is you know many people have have god has spoken the word into people's lives he's speaking the word to people and you know many people stand up today and they say oh you know if i could have though if i could hear the lord speak to me if i could have if i could hear a word from the lord and people are seeking for things but the problem is is they don't know where to look to find the word of god or to to find the answers from god and and and that's it it's so amazing how how god has tried to reach people and and people don't realize that god is speaking to people and they don't and they just walk right past it and they're just deaf to what he's tried to say to him and you know many times people are looking i'm trying to i want to find a word from god i want to know what god has for me or you know i'm trying to find an answer and i tell everybody well how much time have you spent in this have you looked into the word of god because you know people don't people because he said man should not live by bread alone he said but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of god and you know you're not going to find it anywhere else you're not going to find it on some street corner you're not going to find it in some self-help book you're not going to find it anywhere but you'll find it in those 66 books that that brother brown said that he said it tells you where you start where you're going and where you came from all the answers that you have need lay right here but the problem is is do we read the scripture as we just as brother branham said they read it as a as a historical book and they they read it as a book of philosophy like you know they they're studying uh confucius or or some some great philosopher you know one of the great philosophers of time but you know they don't read it as that is speaking to them they're not reading it as it speaks to you and i this word right here is written to you and i do we read it as that or we just read it that we're going to try to as brother talk about you know we get into the word we're just going to flip back and forth and we're going to try to skim this or that and you know and we're going to try to slice and dice and get what we want out of it instead of reading the scripture for what it says because what it says is what it means there's god god didn't stutter god didn't he's not double-minded he's not he's not confused on anything what he said is what is what he means but the problem is is we will we submit to that and wait for god to speak to us because many times people have read through the scripture and and satan has come and what satan's job is and what he's really good at is getting people confused on what the bible says and many people are still we're still reading it through a carnal mind we're still reading it through carnal-minded eyes and we're still confused on what the bible says we're still reading it through a denominational eyes and so you know we're still confused on but the problem is is there's a way that's made that you and i can come that we can overcome that that we can that god can speak to us through the scripture that we don't have to be confused about what it says we're not to be confused by that i thank god because you know as as brother brahm talks about this is uh this is a love letter this is this is a letter of love that was written to you and i and you know the thing is if it's written to you then you know what then god wants you to understand it then if he's written the scripture to you then then his desire is for you to know what it says so the thing is is you know i don't have to be confused and i don't have to be scared and i don't have to be worried about things i don't have to because you know what god's going to lead me through that god will make known what he has for you but the problem is if i get to the place where i try to figure it out on my own and not wait on him to let me know what it says is for him to speak if i try to figure it out on my own then you know what i get confused i get messed up i get i get displaced everything gets out of out of the wac but there's one thing i can do is have confidence in god of what he's come to do and what he's called me to do and what he's called me for is he's going to bring me to this place that i can have confidence in these things that you know i'm not going to be lost i'm not going to i'm not going to be taken away i can't i can't be separated from god because the scripture tells us that when in romans there he said you know what can separate me from the love of god you know what can separate me from this and he said father who can separate us from the love of god who can separate he said he said will my trials separate me from the love of god he said well there anything is there anything in this world that we know of he said no height no depth no nothing nothing created not not there's nothing seen unseen no matter what it is no matter what comes or goes there's nothing that can separate me from the from the love of god he said he said we've been made more than conquerors through him that loved us so we can have confidence in what he's done why because he he has come to take us all the way through because when when man fell you know what he didn't leave man off by himself somewhere just to deal with things but you know what he came to man and you know he'd already made a provision for man before he fell that there would be a way made and then when then he came to man when when adam and eve fell and they separated themselves from god god didn't stay away but he came looking for adam and he come been calling for adam and it's the same way with you and i you may walk away from god but if you're a son a daughter of god then you know what he comes calling for you he's calling for you he's wanting to have fellowship with you you may try to separate from him but you know what you can be separated from him a true son or daughter of god cannot be separated from him i tell you what like like wade says if this don't stir your soul your spoons fell out of your bowl yes that's right i'm happy to know these things see god in the message messiah brother branham says now when god made man and in genesis 1 26 it shows he said you're putting down scripture genesis 126 he said it shows that man that god made man to be a god to begin with man was made to be a god a lesser god he was made to be in the image and likeness of god he had hands like god he had feet like god eyes ears and intelligence like god his whole fiber because he was a son of god and jesus referred to him as god and so he was talking about he said how can you condemn me saying i'm the son of god is it written your law that you are gods and if they call those gods who the word of god came to how can you condemn me when i say i'm the son of god he was referring to the prophets the anointed ones lester anointed jesus was so anointed that he was more than a prophet jesus was so anointed until he was the fullness of the godhead bodily he was god the prophets had the same kind of anointing only owner only in a lesser condition and jesus in genesis 1 26 when god made man he made him a god because he gave him dominion we and he had rulership he had power over the birds of the air the cattle over the the winds the waves the fishes i see everything he had dominion over everything he was a ruler anointed a ruler because he was in the likeness in the image of god with an earthly domain that's why the bible says the earth is groaning crying waiting for the manifestation of the sons of god the world is waiting for the man to come back into his right estate so god made us god made man to have a dominion over the earth you know because god has you know because if you if you're made in god's image and god is ruling things and then when he made us when he made man to be a ruler also then you know that's that's the expression of god is to be to have that dominion over over the earth and and to do the things that god has called us to do to have that dominion but you know if if we don't walk in that dominion then you know we're not walking into what god has called us to be in that and to have that dominion over over the earth and and you know we see the condition that everything is in today and it's because man has fallen god man has walked away from god but you know he made he's made provision for man to come back and you know we still see all the things that have happened today all the sin and the sorrow the condition that the world is in today we see the falling you know every death that's taken place every heartache all the things that have taken place all of the turmoil the chaos everything has happened in this world it's all because man has come out of from the position that god called him for because you know god called us to be a pos come into a position to be just like him and you know there is no there's no chaos in god there's no confusion in god there's no there's no a mess in god but you know but man has created this mess because he because he wants to be like god just like satan wants to be like god but he doesn't want to follow in the divine order that god laid out and so god is trying to call us back to the place and that's what the word has come as brother bob was talking about this morning the word has come for we can see what the divine order is that we can come back in divine order that we can be just like jesus christ but you've got to come into the headship of the word that you can come to that divine order so god has called us to a position god wants us to be in a certain place and so when when he came when when jesus when he spoke of that one what he told adam and eve when he said he said there would one come and he said he said that he would be the woman's seed would come and he said that he would bruise his head but he said you'll bruise his heel speaking of an atonement that would be made and so you know when you see that what what he came to do the scripture tells us he said that he said for he hath made him to be sin for us in second corinthians who knew no sin that we might be the righteousness of god in him so when there was when there was a fall took place and we were separated from god god came that he loved us so much when we were unlovable that he made a way back that we could be exactly what he was that he became what we were who was no who was not sinful who didn't have any didn't have any faults didn't have any any failures but he came and took on the form of sinful flesh that he could come to be just like you and i that we might be just like him that we can be the righteous brother i'm saying the very righteousness of god in him and many times you know we wonder if you know people don't get the grasp the concept of understanding just exactly who you are because you know jesus didn't come from from glory and lay aside all of the splendor and all the things of heaven and come down to be to be born a virgin in in a manger laying on in over a manure pile to come and feel the heartaches and the pain and the sufferings that you and i have walked to walk the all these years upon the earth and and be the scourge of the society and the community and and not and have a terrible name and all the things that he had suffered and then for to go through all of that and yet he's preached the word to the people to understand there was a kingdom there was a place that he wanted to bring the people he said in my father's house are many mansions and he said i've i've gone to prepare a place for you that where i am you may be also and when he went through all of that and then when he went to calvary and he took those stripes upon his back and he took all that to be beaten to unrecognizable as a human and he took all of that and he carried that cross up the hill to be to be crucified the worst the worst punishment that anyone could suffer when he went through all of that on the cross of calvary and then he wants then he wants us to you and i to come to a place and wonder if we're not worthy well you know what you're not worthy but you know what he loved you so much that you are worthy why because he wouldn't have suffered the way he did he wouldn't have done exactly what he did he wouldn't have come that way and suffered the ridicule and all of the pain and all the agony and everything else so you and i can be to wonder if we're not if we're not if we're not second-class citizens no he came god from heaven the eternal elohim came into flesh and suffered as a human that he could become that we could become the righteousness of god we have become the righteousness of god and you know what he's preached the invitation to you and i to become exactly what he was do exactly what he is you know because you try to share that with people you know what because people do not see who jesus is and people wonder you know satan has sold people a bill of goods that you know trying to make people think they're lower than who they are they think that they don't have access to that but he said come boldly before the throne of grace that if we to make or not our petitions known to him see people wondering so you know why you know what we don't have to be sick we don't have to be afflicted we don't have to why because he took them away from me i don't have to suffer why because there's something inside of me that burns and we need to tell people you know what you don't have to live the same way that you've always lived you don't have to live the way the world does i don't want to live like the world i want to show the world that there's that jesus christ that came when when he suffered all all of the things that all of the humiliation and everything when he was on the cross i was on his mind he wanted me to come to that same place he was he came to if he didn't come to redeem nobody else he'd come to redeem me and and so i want to accept exalt that he hasn't made it in provisions he's made for me i don't i don't want to you know because if we don't accept what he's done for us if he went through all that and you don't accept what he's done for you then you devalue his his sacrifice you devalue what he's done because if he come to do all of that and you know he come to bring you into fellowship with him that you can be a son that's right he's the scripture tells us and romans said that we have become heirs of god and joint heirs with christ well then if we become heirs of god then when we come to the scripture to see what god has done for us then you know what it's ours so when i look in the scripture and there's so many people that when they talk about the atonement and you hear people preach and they and they're trying to they talk about well you know healing is in the atonement but but that's off some somewhere else when when in the sweet by and by we're going we're going to do what all sickness and disease will be done away with and we're just waiting on that great glorious day in the future and all that will be taking place but you know what i don't have to be sick today and you know what i get healed today and be sick tomorrow but you know what i can still be i can still be healed the next day no matter how many because you know we're not we're not immune from problems we're not immune from sickness but the problem is is you know we can be healed because that was that was his that was god's great plan is that he said that when when he came then he wanted those attributes to be displayed so guess what when we get sick then he can be a healer well when we have problems he can be he can be our deliverer when we have all these things that happen he can be he can be our answer he can be he can be our comforter he can he can be our god he can be everything that we have need of he can he can show us everything but that's what he wanted to be displayed so you know if we get sick then everybody's like well you know christians don't get sick christians don't have problems no they don't make us immune from all of that because that's not what god wanted so he because if if he was he couldn't show his attributes if we were if we were free from all that but the thing is is when we have those problems when these things come and guess what we can be brought and be made free from those things see that's what god he wants us he wants us to see if you if you're sick or if you have a problem whatever it is if you're if you're seeking for the baptism of the holy ghost or whatever it is that you're that you have need of then you know what god wants you to know that it's available brother branham said he said if you were sick today he said he said he and you asked him to heal you he said he couldn't heal you more than he's already done he because he said the price has already been paid the purchase has already been made he said the way has already been made he said but the thing is is you and i got to realize that and accept it why because he said hey brother i'm saying that he would want to get he wants to give us the baptism of the holy ghost more than we want it for ourselves you know sometimes that's hard that's hard to imagine that he wants to give it to us more than we want because sometimes we sit and we struggle and and we and we wrestle with things and we try to figure things out and you know what we don't let god move that's right because we're trying to figure some way that we've got to wrestle or we got to do this so we got to do that but you know we don't walk with god and just trust him because you know what if and it's everything it's it's the whole journey of a christian just walk with god amen and if we just trust him then he can lead us i was thinking about where brother is talking about uh women trying to get trying to have children and you know he said sometimes they get so worked up that there's no way that they can receive right yeah and you know they and so they try to have children and they can't so then when when they end up not pregnant then they then it gets worse and it just becomes a compound problem that they deal with because they get their body gets so worked up because their emotions are so tore up right and he said he was talking about women and sometimes you know they'll you'll see people they'll go out and they'll uh adopt a child and then all of a sudden you know something takes place well all of a sudden she gets her mind off of that sometimes when they adopt a child then all of a sudden she's she's spending time with this child and she's bonding with and everything and then all of a sudden the next thing you know she ends up pregnant well why because she's able to get her mind and her body back to the place where she can receive yeah that's right and many times we get the same thing is you know we're trying to find an answer from god and we're and we get so worked up and we're not putting our faith in god we're trying to work something up physically or mentally you know we're trying to work on this thing we get so worked up and it's like we're not trusting god can you just trust god you know because if if if we can if that is that is the thing about the new birth it's entering into that rest so everything when we when we have a a promise from god then we can rest in the promise of god because if we you know many times people want to pray about things and we want to pray and we just want we want god oh lord to do something for us and we just want to pray pray and we're just trying to work things up and many times we have no communion like brother dale always tells us you know if the lord wakes you up early in the morning you wake up you know sometimes like okay lord you know talk to me but you know there's no communion you know it's it's like talking to certain people you know you you call somebody on the phone and and they do all the talking which i was talking to brother matthew bray you know the it's probably the last time i was down in his church but anyway i saw about you talk to brother matthew bray he gets on the phone he starts preaching and it's like it was really good and i was like i just enjoy listening to him i don't have to say nothing i just let him talk yes that's right so brother matthew told me he said well the next time he said you call he said i'm not going to say nothing i'm going to let you do the talking i said no i call because i enjoy it but you know there's times when when when you talk to people you know it's that way that they do all the talking right and many times people think well that's that's what prayer is and it's like no we we pray and you know so when you pray and you want to commune with god there's times that i just pray and and you know i talk to the lord and the next thing i do i just sing i don't do nothing else i just sing and you know there's times when i'm just singing that's when the lord will give me something sometimes it's just a word but sometimes you know it's something that you enter into that you make yourself available that god can come speak to you and not and not just try to you know you know a lot of people they want to they want to pray like you know they think that praying is uh praying the king james prayers you know we got to use all the dyes and the dowels and the vines and and they and you know all and they they think they're they're praying some holy prayer because they're using certain words and it's just like you know lord help me you know because god knows what's on on your heart you don't have to try to to make a flowery prayer to god god knows what's on the heart he knows he sees he sees more than you know from the inside so you don't have to try to try to uh impress him we're not trying to impress him but we just make ourselves known that he can he can speak to us so jesus came brother braham says he said this is is it not it is i be not afraid brethren said he said then one day there came another great warrior he was the warrior of all of them jehovah manifested in flesh jesus christ his son he came down and told them that there was a land far beyond this land there was a land where men didn't die no more and he said there is life after death and he told it for three and a half years then one day he came to kadesh barnea where he stood the judgment for all for us all the judgment seat of god where god poured out upon him the iniquity and the penalty for our iniquity the wrath of god upon him and he bore in his body our sins and he crossed the river that we called jordan death but on easter morning like joshua he came back with the evidence man lives again after death they thought it was a spirit they said feel me a spirit doesn't have flesh and bones like i have said you have something to eat and they gave him fish and bread and he ate it and he said i'm i'm going to give you the earnest of this land but i'll wait up there at jerusalem until you get the down payment he said so they went up and they up there and waited and the earnest was sent back at that of that land and dave and today we enjoy that we are now reckoning ourselves dead and buried with him in baptism we are raised with him spiritually speaking we are now tonight setting in heavenly places in christ jesus raised up with him we are now in the body of christ first corinthians 12 said we are by one spirit we're all baptized into one body by what that's the earnest of our inheritance we already got the down payment on it but we know that we've passed from death unto life we look back and see where we once were and where we are now there's sin in the world down there we've raised above it sitting with him our king in heavenly places in christ jesus what an evidence and not even death itself when a great warrior paul come to face it he screamed oh death where is your sting oh grave where is your victory but thanks be to god who gives us the victory through our lord jesus christ amen i'm so thankful that we've been given that victory so you know he came and we conquered he conquered these things and he come and to bring us eternal life to carry us but and he's given us the evidence of this he said it was the earnest of our inheritance and so you know i'm so glad that we know that we we are sealed until the day of our redemption because you know he took up all this upon himself that he can come back and he wants to show us and and proved us that that we have overcome and that's what you have to do and you know we see the we wonder why we have problems in the different things that come our way why because it's god showing us who we are and what god has done and you know and you know we see that the world the condition the world is in today but i thank god that god has made a way to show us that we've overcome all these things and you know you know people people wonder how you know the condition that the world is in and how things are going but i'm so glad you know i i we have an evidence we have an assurance that you know what this is not the end and you know what i thank god because now is the time that the world is falling apart and it's getting close but god has made a way for you and i to see that we have and we can have that assurance that you know we don't have to stay here we don't have to live under the under the curse of the world and and all these things why because god has brought us to a place and he's made us daughters and sons of god and he's brought us above this and we are sitting today now in heavenly places the weekly that we can sit in heavenly places in christ jesus so we see these things and you know we see how the the world has come into the condition that it's sin and all the things that has happened and but you know god has has brought to us his life and you know when you when you see that the life of god has come to you you know there's a there's a there's a journey that a christian goes on to you know god carries you on this when you when you first hear this hear the word and and realize you know you're not who you are supposed to be that you don't you know many there's many people in the world today and and you see them and and people grow up and you know they are out there and they they say well you know i have always grown up in this family and you know and they said well you know i don't look like anybody in the family and you know and so they they wonder why things are so they they don't have the mannerisms that people do and you know they have questions about where they came from and you and now everybody does dna and you know many times you'll find on on the news where people you know they wonder why why i'm not like a certain person you know they say you know they have these questions about things well you know all of a sudden they take a dna test and you know they've lived in a family all these years and they've known these people and they've been called by a certain name and all these things and all of a sudden one day they take a dna test and come to find out you know what they're not related to these people you know they're not they don't have the same last name all of a sudden they come to find out they're somebody else you know they have they have another family and and they they realize hey you know i look and all of a sudden they meet somebody who's like hey you know what i look like them i talk like them there's all these connections to these people one because they who where they grew up that wasn't who they were you know as brother i'm talking about that eagle in the in the chicken yard there was that that eagle walking around you know he didn't understand anything about digging in a manure pile he didn't understand about that thing he didn't understand that mama chicken clucking he said it didn't it was not a language that he was a familiar with it didn't speak to him but you know you know it's the same way with you and i there there's a and and you know as brother bob was talking about this morning everybody wants to say that it was just you know we just come to a realization what we always were but you know there was a day that you realize you know what god spoke to you and you realize you know what i'm not where i ought to be there comes a day you realize you know what i'm a sinner i realize today that that i am not in the right fellowship with god that you know what god made a provision for me god made a way for me that i don't have to live in sin there was a way that made that covered that chasm between man and god and his name was jesus christ and he came to make a way that i can become what he is and so that i can receive and i realize that you know my sins can be covered that i can become justified and there's a way that that i can repent and and be baptized that's right because the scripture tells me he said to repent and be baptized in the name of jesus christ for the remission of sins that i can see you know what there was a way made and i realized that i'm a sinner and that i can change that i can become a son of god that i can repent and be baptized then brother branham said after that the holy spirit begins to work on you and realize you know what you need to get rid of the things of the past the old nature that you have has to be gone and he begins to work on you to get rid of the old to become sanctified to do away with that old man for you to overcome that and then when you come through that place a journey of sanctification then he said the baptism of the holy ghost will come and fill you that you can be filled by the holy ghost and then when you realize that you've come through that journey that you recite realize that the same life that lays inside of you today is the same life that walked in on the shores of galilee was the same life that lays inside of you is the same life that stepped out on nothing and began to speak and say let there be let there be and created the world amen and you know what he came to you that you might be what he is [Music] that you and i can be the sons and daughters of god what does that mean what does it mean to be a son what does it mean to be a daughter what does it mean to be the offspring of god what does that mean it means that you are what he is so when when you know you know he never walked in a place when when jesus walked down the earth you know what there never was a funeral he raised the dead right you know what there never was a time that he was defeated by the devil by the word when the pharisees and and and all even when satan come to tempting and when they when he brought the word to him then you know what jesus brought satan right back to the word and told him he said man shall i live by bread alone but by every word of the percent of the mouth of god he showed it he said he said you know and when he talked about showing him the world and all the things that was going to take place and all of the all of the great worlds and the kingdoms and everything that was going to take place why jesus jesus wasn't going to bow to satan in that time why because he realized he was already the one that made it and he was already the ruler of it amen well satan satan was just here for a little while sure satan what brother brahm said satan jesus knew that he was the ruler of the world he was the king of the world he was ruling but you know what he only had a space of time in which he's able to do his and then after that it goes right back to god see he wasn't going to fall for satan's lie why because he knew he was already going to be the ruler of it see satan and satan trying to trying to put something over on jesus jesus realizes satan there was a day that satan's going to be bound and then he'll be done away with you so you know we don't have to bow down and worry one because he's just a bluff see death is just a bluff well because when jesus died and he rose again then when he rose what'd he do he said i conquered death hell in the grave so when he took the keys of death hell and then he didn't satan don't even have a key to his own house he hasn't he has no more dominion who allows him to have dominion who allows him to have rulership over anything there's nothing that can come to you as a son or a daughter of god unless god allows it that's right and the only other time that god is that satan is able to allow to touch a son or daughter of god is when we get away from the word when we when we step out from behind the fortification of the word then satan has his way with us but you know as long as we have as long as we stand fortified behind the word and what god has given us then you know what satan has no power over us why because he comes to buffett us he comes to press us but he can't overcome us so we can overcome we are overcomers but we have to realize that you know satan is coming and he's going to press you to see what your testimony is going to be to find out what you're actually going to believe you actually stand and claim what is what your god-given right is what god has given you are you going to claim that brother brown says this is from things that are to be and he was he speaks and says scroll down see yeah just keep on scrolling down we're going to skip some of this he said the likeness and all the things that he did expresses the things that are to come just as the body gives you here just as this body he gave you to live and only expresses that there is one that is greater yet to come see if we bear we have borne the image of the earth we have also we will also bear the image of the heavenly which holds no evils in this one that is to come now this one does hold evil and sickness and sorrow and he's talking about as he was preaching in transferring the power of transformation but if you skip down he says but the world had sinned so the penalty of sin was death and he had to die and that's why god was manifested in flesh so he could take sin on him to pay the penalty there's nothing i see there's nothing to come back it's not earmarked it's absolutely freely paid all the debt is paid it belongs there it is belongs to him now and we are delegates of his kingdom assembled here together tonight in the name of jesus christ settingly sitting in heavenly places so you know he's he's paid the debt for us and he's brought us into this heaven and heavenly places that he's brought us to but you know even because because of the fall you know god has taken up residence on the inside the soul of man but you know we still the devil still has that that attack on the flesh he can still buffet the flesh and he can still still put things on the flesh and we still live in this world and still uh have to be subject to the things of this world you know brother brown talks about living in a pest house and he was talking about you know a pest house is you know a place where they put diseased people and you live in and you're living in this pest house and we've many times have always talked about living in this pest house here we are living in this in this realm living in these bodies and still getting old and and all the things that we have to go through to get tired get hungry all the things that we have to face in here but he said it was just showing us that there's a land well you know what we're not going to get sick anymore we're not going to get tired anymore we're not going to have any more heartaches we're not going to have any death there because because we're going to be free with all from all of these these things that living in this past house but he said he said but i've gone to a place to prepare for you a place in my father's house because you know there's a place in my father's house he said you know it's a perfect place and he said there's a perfect place and he said perfect people go to live there and he said you know all the things that are perfect there and you know and everything is is just absolute perfection and and he said you know then we we have this place that there's a perfect bride that's going to be living in a perfect place and he said where i've gone he said he said i want you to know that he said i'm going to prepare a place for you that where i am you may be also and you know that's when thomas asked him you know lord where where is this place and how are we going to get there and jesus said i am the way he is the way and you know what if he started out on this journey and he's brought you to this place and you know what he's going to carry you all the way through because he started you on this journey that you're going to go all the way through from beginning to end and so you know if you've started on this journey and he's brought you to this place and he's put you in in this place of heavenly places or you're standing today in heavenly places that you that you can go from here and he's going to continue on because if he started this good work he's going to continue on with it and you know we when we see that we're living in this pest house but you know what there's a there's a day coming where we can lay down this this pest house there's coming a day when you know these all these earthly things are going to pass away you know as the scripture tells us you know it's not it's not a it's not a bad thing if if a believer passes from here you know because paul said you know in first thessalonians you know he talks about he said you know i don't want you to be ignorant of those that sleep yeah and he said those that are asleep in jesus so you know you know there is no death to a saint when when you've already died to your old man the old man has died you've died to yourself that he might live that he's taken up residence in you through the new birth and you know what there is no more death because death death may come to you but you know what their death can't take you death can only carry you into the presence of god so there is no there is no you know because you know brother and talked about you there's a lot of fear and things that are associated with death but you know what a real true son a daughter of god there is no death there is no fear because you know what he'd come to take all that away from us because he wants us to realize you know if we pass from this realm into the other realm then you know what it's just it's just one breath here and the next one we're in their mortality there's just one breath here and we're stepping into incorruption you know there's just one breath here and then we're stepping into eternity and you know what it's just we're walking from here to there and many times people worry about what's going to take place but you know what there is a trust there is an assurance that we have in him it doesn't matter whether we have to go by the grave or we can just walk by through a body change and leave here but you know what when we go through that thing then you know what it doesn't matter god has made a way and god has always has already made the way and made it perfect for us to pass through you know you know as we were in the hospital with dad and you know dad really couldn't communicate with us or anything like that but you know you know it's it's a it's a great thing to realize that when when you know you don't want to lose loved ones but you know what it's a wonderful thing to realize when they get ready to cross over they know where you know where they're going when they can when they step up to that jar that place you know there is it's a it's a sad time and there's heartache and everything like that but praise god there's a place where you know what when you when you get ready at the end of your journey and you get ready to cross over let me tell you there's there's the wonders and splendors of heaven there's things the bible tells us that i have not seen ear not heard never neither has it entered into the heart of man our mental faculties cannot imagine what how great it is when we step out of this realm into that realm people don't realize how great it is and you know what when we when we leave here we go over there and they're waiting on us then praise god you know that's a wonderful thing you know because you know what there's no more sickness there's no more disease there's no more heartache but you know what i you know if we do that then that's wonderful and i praise god that we know where the saints are when they step into that sixth dimension but you know what it gives us it gives something to me because it puts a fire in me why because it's it's stirring me why because it's you and i we've got to come to the place that we are going to fulfill all that god has for us to do that we can walk and walk in the word and realize what god has done for us and given us the word that we can take a body change one because it has been spoken you know if the if this if this body goes to the earth this earthly house of this tabernacle is dissolved he said we have one not made with hands eternal in the heavens so we've already he's already got provision made for us but the thing is is have we made the provision you know because people you have to know as brother bob was talking about this morning we need to know where we stand with god you need to you need to have the assurance brother ram said you you need to make sure that you have a reservation have you made reservations for that place because you know we can we can walk have the assurance to walk in that to continue in that we need to walk in what god has given us can we continue in the word and he said he said because he's given us this word and he's brought us to a place that you and i can have assurance of where we stand he's already he's already conquered and he's made it away and then we can hold on he said a true believer holds on to the word that god has given us we have that assurance to hold on to what god has given us do you hold on to what god has given you and realize you know i can i can hold on i can walk and be confident in what god's done for me because it's not what i've done it's not it's not the goodness of me it's the goodness of god that he's brought us to this place you know if we come to this place and we can have assurance of where we stand and then you know we just walk with god and if we come into that places brother bob was talking about this morning when we come into that place where god has called us to and we have that assurance that we stand to know where we're standing at today that we're sons and daughters of god that we have been sealed until the day of our redemption then we begin to walk with god and if god is leading us that god will lead us as he was up talking about the statue of a perfect man you know then then you know you just add to your faith virtue and virtue knowledge and all these things is god is leading you through these things he's leading you and adding these things to you and then he said he said for an entrance shall be ministered unto you into that everlasting kingdom so there's a you know because these things is what's going to carry you all the way through is to continue in the word as long as you're here god the reason god has you here is for a reason god has you for a reason here when you finish your journey it's god's going to take you home but the thing is as long as you're here then you know what we're supposed to be walking in the word and and adding adding through this every day you know stepping into the end of the perfect image of jesus christ not and not taking a step back or not trying to stand still but to continue walking in that continuing the walking in the word and seeing one because god if god's called you then you know there's a place that god has called you to come to then you know what that's what you and i have to do is keep walking be faithful in what god has called us to do you know you know we don't know how long we're going to be here what god's called us to but you know we don't all have to come to the same place but the one thing we do have to do is be faithful in what god has called us to do the same place that god has called us that we can walk and be faithful in what god has called us to be because god has given us his life to lead us so if god has given us his word he's given us his life then you know what the life that he's given us will may we'll make it we'll make be made manifest you know because he said as brother i was talking about you know the different different ones he said you know if i had the spirit of beethoven then you know i would do the things that beethoven done and and the different ones but he said you know if i have the spirit of jesus christ if i have the life of jesus christ then you know what the things that jesus done will be made manifest then you know what if if i as paul said it's no longer i that lived now well you know what if i just allow because you know we try to we try to wrestle with things and and we get in god's way but you know what if we allow the life that's inside of us then you know what we can overcome that jesus christ be made manifest the same life that that spoke walked out on nothing and spoke everything into existence the same life that came and never had a funeral service the same the same one that all through the scripture that came and done all the all the miracles and all the things it's the same life that so if it was the same life that come into you and i then you know we don't have to live below our standards god has given us this that we have come to this place so the thing is is we have to continue to press the battle god has called us from the pest house but he's called us to his house he's made to prepare a place for us that we can we can leave here and all you think you think all the years that that has been going on and you know god has a desire for you to come to the place that he wants you to be he wants to fellowship with you you know there's a day that you know you think about eternity god living in eternity here he is the the great eternity and then there's this one little expanse of time that we're here we came from eternity and we've come down here in earth we're spiritual beings living a a natural life in time but we're going back to be spiritual beings again going back to eternity you know what and we don't we don't know how long it's going to be but we know it's a short time but you god wants us to come that's what god's calling us home god has a desire for us to come back for us to to you know we have to live in these pest houses and do all these natural things but you know what god wants us to get ready because you know if you if you have you know you think even having children you know and your children are gone and you don't see them for a while or whatever you know there's a desire to see your children and you know you can you can talk to your children on the phone and you can facetime them and and everything like that but let me tell you what when your children are gone there's nothing like having your children with you and how much more with jesus christ you know because he's one day you know we all get to be just like him and we can all fellowship with him and you know there won't be any more time and won't be any more heartaches or anything like that because we'll be just like him we'll have a body just like under his glorious body see this is from god making a promise brother branham says a real born-again child of god looks to heaven and knows that father holds the reigns of all things he does all things well and there's neither death nor sorrow for a christian christians doesn't die there's not one scripture that says a christian dies very vice versa jesus said he couldn't die if you believed on him so he has no death and that is the greatest thing that put fear over man was death jesus died for us and death is swallowed up in victory so when coming to the end of the road like saint paul said o death where is thy sting o grave where is thy victory but said thanks to be to god who gives us the victory through our lord jesus christ and from the from the next quote there from number 12 this is from a message from that time and he's talking about when a bee stings deeply it loses stinger honey bee insect things got a stinger when it stings the flesh anchors and pulls the stinger out when death met god's death lost its stinger and now death has no stinger it can buzz and make a noise and say i'll take you i'll kill you i'll do this that or the other but it has no stinger it lost at yonder and calvary he said no wonder paul could say when he was coming down the end of the road oh death where is your stinger oh grave where's your victory but thanks be to god who gives us the victory through our lord jesus christ how that from that time death has no stinger for the believer christ took the sting of death out for the believer there's where he was wounded for our transgressions bruce for our iniquities and the chastisement of our peace was upon him with his death we are healed from that time satan was stripped of everything that he had he's nothing but a bluff death is a bluff it's just a bluff it has no stinger and you know you know we have we have been blessed to realize you know satan's a bluff and there there is no death for for a christian and you know what whether whether we like paul you know we're going to the grave and we lay this body in the grave you know there is there is no victory in that because you know what he can't hold us he can take this flesh but he can't take he can't take you and i he can't take the real person and you know and also to realize that you know even even if we're we're not we don't go to the ground but you know there's a group that's going to come to the body change and you know what that stinger still doesn't have an effect on us you know even if you go if you go by the way of the grave if you if you make the body change you know what death has no victory in it satan has no victory he hasn't he has no hold on a christian and you know we have been given the victory through jesus christ and so to realize you know there is no there is no death uh victory and death you know where where is your where is your sting where is your victory there is no victory why because we have the victory through jesus christ we have overcome so you know we realize when so when we realize that death is just a bluff the last the last enemy to be destroyed is death the last enemy and we're going to realize that you know what death by the word that has been brought to us by the word but through jesus christ we have received the word that would bring us to a body change that you know what death has no hold on us why because it has been purchased it has we have been made free and that's the next thing is to re to uh to receive a revelation to understand that god has made us free from that death death has no hold on us has no victory in over us we are free and yes all the way down through history all the different ones yes he was a bluff and took them down but you know thanks be to god that we live in this day in the end time this is the day in which god brought the word for us to receive a body change is uh first thessalonians 4 says very familiar says but i would not have you ignorant brethren concerning them which are asleep that you sorrow not even as others which have no hope for if we believe that jesus died and rose again even so them also which sleep in jesus will god bring with him for this we say unto unto you by the word of the lord that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the lord shall not prevent them which are asleep for the lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of the archangel and with the trump of god and the dead and christ shall rise first then we which are alive and reign shall be caught up together with him in the clouds to meet the lord in the air and so shall we ever be with the lord wherefore comfort one another with these words i'm so thankful that we have we have received that why because you know you know so many people in this world have have been you know looking for something and but you know i thank god we've had a prophet in our day come and tell us you know because we have received the shout we have received a message in our day and it has brought us to the place to realize who we are where we came from and where we're going we have received this word and this word is going to bring us through because we are going to come to this place to receive a body change amen kind of the community the musicians coming you know he said to comfort one another with these words we received the message in our day to bring us to this place and he's come to make known these things and i'm so thankful that god has given us his word we live in a we live in a pest house but god has made a way that we can go to a place that he's prepared for us i thank god it's so good to sit and think about what you know because god doesn't want us to be here you know because this is we have no continuing city here but we're looking for a city whose builder and maker is god amen i just thank the lord for that you know it's good to realize where you're going you wake up some mornings and just realize you know just a little while to labor here just a little while to wait but you know we know that eternity soon will unfold and i'm looking forward to that you know we lose our loved ones and and they go from us but you know you realize that you know they're not that far away they're just in another dimension just a faster dimension but you know what it won't be long we'll see them again i'm looking forward to that i you know it's a it's a good thing because you know it encourages me you know because if every time a soldier finishes their race you know it it ought to stir us to fight the fight to continue to run however whatever we have to do god let me be faithful in all that you've called us to do and you know each one has done their part now let's do ours amen god bless you let's all stand we'll have brother michael lead us into a song [Music] wonderful wonderful [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music]
