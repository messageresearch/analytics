here this morning I thought I seen one or two okay God bless you and U we're going to read the scripture and let you be seated just in a moment and um uh ask brother Dale and brother Wade uh if they trusted me and they yeah I said well I tell you what I'm going to do I'm going to receive an offering tonight then how many would give if I us to receive an offering well what I'm going to what I'm suggest you we do is uh everybody put in your clocks your watches and your cell phones and we'll take this clock down right here you know put it the basket and if everybody pull if everybody pulls real good then I'll give your watches back after oh my I believe that we can just get in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus amen already passed from Life unto death into eternity and well um I'm kind of like the old circuit riding preacher I like to think I am sometimes he went into this store building and he swept it out cleaned it out he's going to have a Revival for the first time and so he hung up his shangle you know Revival and and he announced around and whenever they got ready to have service well there was just one old sheep herder came into town and came to the meeting and so uh the preacher stood around nobody else come you know he talked to that old farmer and Rancher and said well I guess we can't have a meeting ain't nobody coming and the Rancher said well my goodness you know he said you know if I go out to feed my sheep and there just one old sheep comes up I at least feed that one sheep and so the farmer he said well I mean the preacher thought maybe he's hting I better preach you know he want he wants to hear something he come for some sheep food so he preached and he preached and he preached and he preached and he preached and finally he closed up and shook the man's hand said how'd you enjoy it he said oh man he said I'm full up said I I really did enjoy it you really fed me that was real sheep food said but you know what said when I go out to feed my sheep said if just one old sheep comes in I don't dump the whole load on one sheep so I'll try not to dump the whole load tonight amen all right I've got two place in the scripture I want to read first Luke Chapter 2 and this will kind of maybe tie it in with what we had this morning amen and uh just a little portion here of Luke 2 and then we want to go I believe it's 2 Corinthians 12:10 or uh 12:7 um I wondered who that was that sung is this the brother back here that sung the is that brother Tom my tell you what brother Tom is say brother Tom if you ever come over to South Carolina I sure want you to sing that song okay that was 83 years old my my I hope I'm perking like that that 8 don't let me forget that brother there you bring him and he said we want we sure want him to sing you know what singing a song when you're inspired of the Lord is kind of like delivering a message makes you feel like you're part of what's going on am and you know all of us in this together aren't we and it's wonderful to see a church where you want everybody to play their part brother it's not no big eyes and little you it's all pulling together amen now yes I'm not this but I told out there we come in I said I really do enjoy that preacher preaching I said he he you know we're on the same way like Brother Sam yes thank you brother God bless you I appreciate you saying that thank you brother Luke chap 2 and verse 41 now his parents went to Jerusalem every year at the Feast of Passover and when he was 12 years old they went up to Jerusalem after the custom of the feast and when they had fulfilled the days notice it didn't say the p Passover was fulfilled right right right when they had fulfilled the days see as they returned the child jesus carried behind in Jerusalem and Joseph and his mother knew not of it but they supposing him to have been in the company went a Day's Journey and they sought him among their kin folks and acquaintance and when they found him not they turned back again to Jerusalem seeking him Y and it came to pass that after 3 days amen must have been in the fourth if he after 3 days after 3 days right they found him right in the temple sitting in the midst of the doctors both hearing them and asking them questions and all that heard him were astonished at his understanding and answers and when they saw him they were amazed and his mother said unto him son why hast thou thus dealt with us Behold thy father and I have sought thee soring and he said unto them how unto them say Joseph and Mary both there probably and uh how is it that ye sought me wished ye not that I must be about my father's business they understood not the saying which he spake unto them and he went down with them and came came to Nazareth and was subject unto them but his mother kept all those these sayings in her heart and Jesus increased in wisdom and stature and in favor with God and man right now one more little portion of scripture I believe it's second Corinthians that I want and if I'm not mistaken it's verse 12 verse 7 may be First Corinthians let's see here 127 uh yes 2 Corinthians maybe 12:7 uh this verse of scripture starts in be uh uh 2 Corinthians 12:7 this is one of the few verses in the Bible that begins and ends the same way and God doesn't use vain repetition right so he's trying to emphasize something here to us right notice and lest I should be exalted above measure it's the great Apostle Paul writing through the abundance of the revelations there was given to me a thorn in the flesh the messenger of Satan to Buffet me lest I should be exalted above measure right and uh listen let's pray and uh just before we're seated Lord Jesus tonight we are asking once again that you will uh just add to Lord uh our understanding the eyes of our understanding might be enlightened and that we'd be able to come a little rung higher up Jacob's Ladder be drawn closer to thee climbing up the pyramid Mountain as it were Lord and God that when we leave the service this evening we would uh be able to say as they that walked with you on the road to amus did not our hearts burn within us as he spake to us along the way and opened unto us the scriptures help us Lord may you do the same because you are the same in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen God bless you may be seated tonight again we want to maybe just take another little part of what we had uh this morning uh up to the yes up to the fullness of the stature of Jesus Christ staying with the word amen and bringing that word to full maturity now the prophet of God taught us uh that there's only one reason for God's displeasure right have I got your attention right only one reason for God's displeasure with you as an individual or a group or church there's only one reason for God's displeasure with any individual you or me or anybody else and that is for you or I to leave the word right and there's only one remedy to regain his favor right and that is for you and I to come back to the word we read this morning from the message how can I overcome and we learned that there was only six in the days of John the Baptist is that what the prophet Tau us only six others offered their offerings and so forth made their sacrifices kept the ores thousands of them perhaps millions of them but these were the elected right amen these overcame right exactly six Overcomers in the days of John the Baptist now you don't overcome when you're passing notes and chew and Bubblegum and all these things in church if you want to be an overcomer you got to come to the word and let the word come to you is that right and so if you will just uh help me now and the more you help me the faster you help me the faster I can preach and the faster we get done and not just we're not here just to get done but we want to get somewhere is that right get get uh you know and um uh find the expression of the word find the expression of the spirit what is needful as we said this morning it has to be a word in season that has never been in season before amen and so let's uh pray that the Lord would just speak to us I need him to speak to me amen right I unless he speaks to me I can't speak to you that's right and so if we have the right attitude and approach to the service I know you might be a little bit tired and so forth but we don't want to entertain that is that right we want to just uh just do our very best put our best foot forward and let the Lord speak to us right now remember every true and fresh Revival comes when men and women have gotten back to the word of God for their age Joseph and Mary left the word right Joseph and Mary were elected and ordained to bring the word to maturity but instead of bringing that word to maturity they left the word that's right when the word itself was coming right to maturity amen the most important time for them to stick with the word right and they had left the word right now listen you don't have to leave 100% of the word all you have to do is leave one word Mary uh uh Eve excuse me did not doubt or misbelieve a whole sentence right or paragraph yeah she only miss one word right amen and if God put Adam and Eve out of the garden for misbelieving or disobeying one word he is God and he won't let you and I go back in right exactly disobeying one word we must come by the way of the word amen amen God's God right he's no respect of persons and so I want to emphasize this tonight staying with every word and letting that word bring us to maturity see it's not you bringing the word to maturity so much as it is letting that word see bring you right and me to its maturity and so we see that uh I want to just read a little something here to you from the church book that comes to me I think I have it marked here somewhere yes page 251 and um then I want to say something uh very positive about the five-fold ministry because a lot of people take this quotation here and they say something negative about the five Ministry or try to do away with it but listen to this is it uh it is not enough that he is a son Associated himself with the whole church which we saw when he was sent seen standing amongst the seven golden lampstands nor is it even enough that we see the fivefold ministry of Ephesians 4 Apostles prophets teachers evangelists and pastors for in each age the church goes astray and it's not just the leoty but the clergy group shepherds are wrong as well as sheep right then God brings himself on the scene right as the chief Shepherd glory in the ministries of these seven men to lead his people back to the truth and the Abundant power of that truth amen God is in his people all of his people for If any man had not the spirit of Christ he is none of his I just read a portion you get the the context of that if you'd like but now see uh God wants us to stay with the word and here myself as a shepherd and a minister God forbid that I'd ever say anything to reflect on that because that's uh you know it one of the most profound things that I ever thought of or could ever see and I seen it years ago is how that somebody claiming to be a preacher part of the fivefold ministry get up and suggest there is no such a thing talk about a self- disputing preacher self- condemning message yeah you know what I'm saying that that we don't need none anymore oh my and you know I I was reminded again what the prophet said in question answers on the seals brother Brenham he asked the question should the would the bride have a Ministry before the Rapture he said why sure that's what's taking place right now amen it consists of Apostles prophets evangelist pastors and teachers is that right but it' be so simple he said amen now so as we see that uh this we want to acknowledge that shepherds are wrong as well as sheep right okay amen and th so we see that God brings himself on the scene through the ministry of these seven Messengers right right well if the seven Messengers have come and gone God must have come in uh as the chief Shepherd y right is that right as I said this morning and we were reminded of what taking place in 1933 when the pillar fire moved down and the Holy Spirit said as John the Baptist was sent to forun my first coming your ministry your message however you want to say it was sent to forerun the second coming then John the Baptist could not be taken off the scene until Christ was introduced right we are in a repeat of that same thing in this day and unless we see that and realize that we're not walking in the light of the Revelation that's right we've got to realize the full word has been birthed back into manifestation again today as it was 2,000 years ago and that it is coming to maturity right when this word begin to come to maturity then uh we see that Joseph and Mary got out of Step a little bit but they got back in life amen you know the church had left the word down through the Dark Ages and when it that's why it went into darkness right but after Luther after Wesley after Pentecost we found the word restored after 3 days and now we know the full word has been birthed back into full manifestation again and God has personified Jesus Christ has personified himself Among Us that's right amen amen right oh my see now brother Brenham said no man will ever reach the plane that Jesus reached I've got the quote right here if you want to read it no and he says it twice in the same paragraph in him was the fullness of the godhead bodily right he said you receive it by measure is that right and even himself he said I I receive it you and I receive it by measure but Christ without measure amen is that right amen but see we see the manifestation of the alpha and omega ministry and it was Jesus Christ manifesting through these seven Messengers re bringing himself on the scene as the chief Shepherd first to appear and then to come see the appearing of the Lord right amen and he appears uh and has appeared and uh we see then in the last few years this manifestation to bring the church to full maturity now we look at Paul Paul was an overcomer in his age you believe that had to be the first church Angel messenger amen but here the great Apostle Paul before he met Christ he had got exalted above mejor oh he was riding a high house and he was persecuting the true church amen and breathing out threatenings against the true church oh brother he'd kill everybody get in his hands on you know or having stoned or putting jail or something and he's seeking more power and more Authority CU he was religious and he was very zealous about his religion right and these a bunch of Cults Jesus name Cults and all these he was getting rid of them he's trying his best to scatter them is that right God was allowing Paul to do it true yeah that's right it was fulfilling the program of God right sure it was Amen Let and the more he scattered him the more the the word went out like like wart is that right right but while Paul was on his road down to Damascus you know what he ran into the pillar fire and U it's hard for thee to kick against the Pricks why persecutest thou me Saul Saul and he got a name change and God took the fight out of Paul right he blinded him for three days exactly y knocked him off his feet talk about humbling him and we're reminded how then concerning that brother bam said anytime you and I are you awake everybody awake rise above that Damascus dust you raise above God that's right amen the Latin word for uh humble the English word humble comes from the Latin word humus yeah which means dust dust y dust Thou Art Y and dust thou returnest amen and you should never forget that amen see and so we see that Paul even after he was converted by the abundance of these true Revelations he wasn't receiving false Revelations right Paul was receiving true Revelations but because he was receiving so many of them yeah abundance through the abundance of the revelations he was having a tendency to be exalted above measure yeah now Satan was perfect in the day was created how many knows that the angel CH that cover God's right-and man to fellowship with brother B said coequal with God in every respect except to be able to create God wouldn't let he was an archangel all Revelation went through him handed down to the angels y he trafficked trafficked in Revelation y he wasn't a drug trafficker he trafficked in Revelation amen but through the abundance of those Revelations God allowed him to get exalted above measure right y right Lord and he got a false Revelation that he wanted a false notion of is our and he said I'll exalt my throne above the stars of God listen brothers and sisters may we never try to exalt ourself above these Seven Stars this message come from God God has brought him on the scene through these Messengers see right and don't you ever think to exalt yourself above the prophet I want you to see something here this evening six Overcomers in the days of John the Baptist and you'll notice how the word had to correct Joseph and Mary yeah and the word had to correct Zachariah you ever stop thinking about that brother brandham said Zachariah was praying for a child yeah zachar Elizabeth was but she was old and Barren yeah and God heard his cry that that Gabriel said your prayer has been heard God heard his heard him and now remember he's one of the Overcomers when God calls a pastor he calls his wife with him so Elizabeth is identified in the ministry with him zachari and Elizabeth all right and uh Joseph and Mary a type of the leoty natural people Carpenter right zachari and Elizabeth a type of the ministry fivefold see but here's an and Sime Simeon and prophet and Prophet as brother R said is that right but it's Christ and the church Christ and the church but three categories of these six see uh three categories and all each one of those categories is a type of Christ in the church see me and Anna as you study that oh it's beautiful right am and uh but we see here that the word had to correct Joseph and Mary and here we see Zachariah you know what he was he was a message preacher yeah that's right he was a message preacher because he receiv received the message the same Angelic visit visitor the same messenger the same Angel messenger that went to Mary right 6 months earlier had going to Zechariah right that's right and by the time Mary got the word from the angel Zachariah was dumb Zachariah was D for at least nine months a minister in the House of God and he remained of course once he finished up his ministration there probably pretty quick after he spitten dumb he went home and Elizabeth conceived but you see he questioned the message of the hour that's right he he doubted it it looked kind of like Mary had questioned but Angel the Lord knows the heart she wasn't doubting she didn't say how can this be sing I don't know man but uh the Lord knew her heart and he just explained to her how it be the Holy Ghost but when it come to Zechariah now here he's been praying for it and God answers his prayer and hear the Angelic visitation tells him what he's going to do and still doubted it exactly how can this be I'm old and Elizabeth's old you know he was doubting a little bit that's okay to doubt if you doubt your doubts right it's okay down a little bit if you just doubt your doubts see that's what brother brand quoted brother bossworth it must be okay okay yeah and so but see he literally doubted and so Gabriel said I tell you what I I'm I'm Gabriel I come right from the presence of God you're doubting my word oh I'll just give you a sign in you want a sign you can't just take it like me saying I'm going to give you a sign you'll be smitten dumb you won't be able to to speak a word until my words have made fullfill cuz you doubted my word right right amen right a dumb message preacher right we got a lot of them thank you Lord I'm glad we got a few that's got their mouth open amen they might slobber like a horse eating tall Clover or something like that sometimes you know and if you sit on the front row you might get baptized or sprinkled but at least they got the mouth that can make some kind of noise but he couldn't make he couldn't speak a word right that's right all he could do is just write you know he just it all had to be in in symbol form letter form whatever he tried to get across is that right right he didn't have the spoken word right exactly he didn't right but amen when he no longer wanted to call the church after his name but the name that Gabriel gave him to call him right they wanted to call him Zachariah or something like that he said no sir his name's going to be John soon as he obeyed the message and acted on the word he the first case of Divine Healing in the New Testament that I know of right in the house of God right amen when they he'd come back see right when he was smitten dumb his administration was finished he went home and the word of the Lord was fulfilled y Elizabeth conceived did you ever stop to think Zachariah might have been there this morning we had a Mary going down to the house of Elizabeth her cousin and there's Zachariah and here's Jesus and here's John the Baptist yeah oh my Zachariah maybe couldn't enter into the Revival like them women could didn't hear him shout too much there no record of him saying a thing exactly he's dumb during that time remember right right oh my but we see when the word of the Lord was fulfilled and he obeyed the word wrote the word oh his tongue was loosed you talk about a shou and good time they had there oh my amen my at the naming of the Prophet M see but but see no where I just said that to say this I'm not suggesting that Simeon and Anna now didn't need a little correction in their life I'm sure the Holy Spirit corrected them but you don't find in the Bible where the word corrected the prophet right right brother Ram said when a major prophet comes on the scene nobody judges him right you don't have to correct him now five-fold Ministry Prophet or something like that you know gift of Prophecy supposed to be judged for it comes to the church to my understand standing a church amen not only the person who gives the message uh where it's tongues or prophecy whatever is supposed to be written down and then U the two or three judges they put their name on it too and then let the pastor read it he don't have to question it just read it but then if it don't come to pass not the pastor's fault right but that man who gave the message and the man who interpreted and the two or three that were supposed to have the wisdom to judge it they all got a lineing spirit on them let him repent before we get anything else from him is that what he taught sure as Church order but you don't judge the major prophet nobody he don't stand in front of nobody exactly and let me tell you something I just said that to say this God didn't send me to correct brother brandham that's right he didn't send the fivefold ministry to correct the major prophet but the other way around he sent the prophet to correct me do you believe that oh yes Moses had to wash and the priesthood before they could Minister Moses was that prophet he had to wash and clothe that priesthood and we have to come under the opes of this word that's been birthed into full manifestation through the ministry of Malachi 4 that which is perfect is come the perfect interpretation of the word of God with the vine of indication oh what an hour we're living in amen listen think about this folks who then would have the the power of infallibility brother Brenham did not claim to be infallible but let me tell you something about the power of infallibility he asked that question who then would have the power of infallibility which we know would be necessary because this last age goes back to receiving the perfect word of God as it was perfectly given and perfectly understood in the days of St Paul exactly and he goes on and says now I'll tell you he'll have it he'll be a prophet right he'll be more thoroughly vind than any of the prophets from anoch forward cuz he's got to bring that word to full maturity oh my let me ask you this what good would it do for God to send us a perfect message if he didn't also give you a perfect understanding so your Revelation would be perfect God don't give no per uh imperfect Revelations he don't give immature Revelations but the Holy Spirit see brings us to that see perfect now he that is true right full Revelation as contrasted with partial Revelation rapturing Revelation that's the our we must mature to this place right see we want to see this Bride come up here to the fullness of the stature of Jesus Christ in full maturity this is what we're speaking on just for a little bit here now and then to being careful young or old man or woman lay person or Minister that we be not exalted above measure through the abundance of these Revelations because we're receiving the same Revelations that Paul received or something's wrong with us right and if he a great Apostle had a tendency to be exalted above measure what about you and I oh yeah right sure through the abundance of true Revelation right exactly Satan was exalted above measure is that right God allowed him you know to fall but he won't allow his elect to fall right that's why he has to Humble us that's why he has to crack the whip that's why he has to pull the rug out from under us some sometimes oh my my my my we don't want to be exalted above measure is that right that's right amen right brother just see how little you can be brother R said right don't see how big you can be right and if you can't say something good about somebody zip the lip you'd be better off like Zachariah is that right sure don't say anything at all right is that what we've been taught amen all right now so here in this now as we look at this we see how that the bride in this age has to come to a maturity right and um uh here in Sturgis Michigan in 56 they was talking about some Theologian jumping on brother B said why the all the apostles any case that was brought to them they never failed a case they never missed a lick said uh let me see you do this let me see you do that I said wait a minute brother we're just in our infancy we're Rising don't worry right when we get all these Fanatics and unbelievers out of the way we'll move on up into Perfection after a while and you'll see signs and wonders but we're just babes crawling just give us a little while right now that was 56 yeah all right and uh then here in spiritual inspiration uh he says it again in 56 uh and this man said well the disciples they always they never lost a case anybody they prayed for what about you and this that and the other brother B said well my eight-year-old daughter better not you better not ever ask her to tell her that she'll make you ashamed of yourself you don't know no more about the Bible than that that's a hard blow wasn't it talking to a theologian said why she knows better than that why what about the case when Jesus come down and the disciples one come to him with the um uh epilep epilepsy and and his disciples couldn't heal him and they had to bring him to Jesus I said what he said what about that and what about the time when Paul had to leave his buddy Luke 6ck right what about that you know and he said uh we're just in our infancy we're moving up and as quickly as we get you a bunch of formal Fanatics out of the way we'll be doing that see amen and but he was showing see that the bride was still somewhat in its infancy yeah and I want you to see this further in the message communion then 62 we see that the astronomers are predicting something in the early part of the first of the month now this is February of 1962 okay beginning on the 2 or the fifth or somewhere along this month the Indian astronomers predict that the world would blow to pieces and the American newspapers make fun of it I do not believe the world's going to blow to Pieces but I do say it's wrong to make fun of it because something's fixing to happen one of these days something similar to that and when the five planets Mars Jupiter and Venus and so forth comes into their uh they never did it oh they claim maybe 25,000 years ago but who was back there to know it see and I predict that this has a spiritual application right all right now watch this where was the first Bible written in the stars right that right now here's a prophet on Earth I don't suggest you try to do this because we got a greater Bible today and not so much that's greater but it's a different order so we don't want to go back into astrology but here's the prophet of God on Earth can inter what's taking place in the Heavens to us all right I predict that this has a spiritual application I believe it's the coming of the issue of God right now if you're going to have a a word to come to maturity first you've got to have the hemoglobin yeah right you got to have a conception you got to have a birth right you before you can have an infant is that right an infant so the issue of God is the hemoglobin of God and the hemoglobin of God is the word of God in the beginning was the word and the word is with God the Word was God now so we see then that he's saying I believe it's the coming in of the issue of God that the great revelation of the word will be open during this time Glory y then he goes on see and and remember that great message he preached uh s is this the time right right see before the seals was open he seen that and he he predicted it right actually later he calls it a prophecy and when he brought it he brought it in the form of a question right sir is this a time but later he called into prophecy for those who could catch it who had the answer they claim it was three stars back to this quote now in communion 62 uh remember they claim it was three stars came into the orbit when Jesus was born and this is five yeah right five is Grace the number of Grace Three is the number of perfection five is the number of Grace j s s g r a c e f a i t h and so forth number of Grace God ever sends his power to the church it'll be his grace amen It Won't Be The Obedience of the people exactly oh that's not to suggest you go out and disobey he's not saying that at all no and Isaiah said in the 40th chapter oh I was just reading that right praying and preparing here last week brother Dale for these Services right cry to my people and tell her her Warfare is accomplished her sins have been paid double for her she's pardoned that's what I Come To Tell You Folks it's finished it's finished it it you know the the actually the marriage license and the whole Plan of Redemption and the book The Abstract title lead is put back in your hand now and it's open to for you to see your name in it right it's finished see we just got to accept it and believe it amen Isaiah said to uh chapter 4 how to cry to Jerusalem that her Warfare was over yet she was guilty of ID idolatry but it was God's grace that was sending it right God sends anything to us it'll be his grace and not merits right right so it may mean something I predict that there will be a change I don't know what it will be but I believe it's fixing to happen we're on right on the eve of it now and if any man hungers let him come into me and thirst If any man thirsty let him come un to Christ he quenches The Thirst he is the satisfier of all our thirst and hunger now just in the next month then uh March of uh right of the same year 62 March the 19th third month 19 days now what happened end time seed sign now what happened we see a roar in the paper across the television across the Nations where five stars just fell into light he spoke of it before it happened and now right after it happens he reversed back to it five stars just fell into line with the world what's five a number of Grace every time those stars come in something happens on Earth what taken place five stars fell in what was it a introducing of what since then just look what taking place Germany almost washed off the map right some of the Magi said that the world would burst like a watermelon every stressful things prophesied by them for the last days look what's taking place England the other day had a storm that blowed away 70,000 houses in one day not seven houses not 700 7,000 houses in one day in England right am right right disasters everywhere California Los Angeles like the worst into the ocean what is it the beginning of Sorrows right that's Bible yeah Matthew 24 exactly what is the beginning right right he didn't say the tribulation is already here but I tell you what the atmosphere is being said the atmosphere is already being set did you know he also said the wrath of God is already in the land absolutely now it's still s with a little Mercy now but when the bride's taken brother I don't want to be here do you no sir it's listen it's going to get worse worse and worse and worse and worse what is it the beginning of Sorrows earthquakes is picked up everywhere why is it five stars just come into line Grace God's grace what happened an infant Church you listening y we're talking about bringing the word to maturity and bringing the bride to maturity an infant Church Hallelujah a bride infancy that the power of God has begin to fall on her right she's taking form right of Bride for the bridegroom amen that three stars meant his Perfection of the heavenly father of the Trinity coming into one on earth Among Us God's office becoming one office 2,000 years ago what happened now what happened now it's the Church of the Living God coming together under the word of God and the astronomic heavens Heaven is announcing her approach three stars announced his approach three becoming lined up they just saw one because he was in line with the earth now they just see one again when they really lined up but it's announcing her approach three for the bridegroom and five for the bride announcing her approach what is it it's the coming of the Lord right see the out Al and the Omega the bride and the bridegroom Christ the Creator the beginning of the creation creating himself a bride amen that's right amen might not believe that but it's the word just the same yes sir amen glory now what's happening um I I I might say this friends the church is coming forth God's going to have a church without spot or wrinkle and she's predestinated God said so he would have it that makes it right who's a member I don't know I'm trusting to be myself I'm trusting you are a member but he's going to have a body without spot and wrinkle and I believe that these latterday signs and things that's happening every one of them is peeling together like bouncy uh to show that Christ is ready to come for his bride it's God in his word made manifest in a man a perfect man so if God and His word coming again making himself manifested in a bride exact not will do like Eve did hi bre it to something else but the unadulterated word of God will be be born in into the church into that church and she'll stand like Jesus Christ did with his Spirit anointing in his word amen I believe it's the announcement now right oh my Hallelujah isn't that wonderful to realize right amen skip on down here just a little bit now what is it now we see see that when Jesus rode into Jerusalem he was introducing himself as the king the Creator he didn't go out and steal a horse he didn't rent a horse and he wasn't no horse thief and he wasn't teaching his disciples to be a horse thief but he was obeying what the father showed him and he was presenting himself as the owner of the horse the cattle on a thousand hills belong to him all the donkeys belong to him and he just said go get him right he showing himself he's exercising his authority of as a king and he he gets his disciples and the Bible says see Zechariah 9:9 behold th King cometh riding on an ass The Cult of full of an ass and so forth and meek and lowely brother BR said tradition tells us it's a white donkey that he wrote on foreshadowing how he was going to come riding on a white charger in the end time amen amen oh my see Revelations see I ain't got no pet Doctrine or anything so don't don't anybody get scared but see it was foreshadowing something to us you understand what I'm saying foreshadowing something to us there amen and uh in that then see coming first as a lamb coming second as a lion is that right right EXA the second the first coming and the second coming first coming to be the sacrifice then coming see to be the judge the lion of the tribe of Judah bringing an indictment against the ungodly that reject the message of their day right exactly see they reject the blood right Mercy's extended y Mercy burn nothing left but judgment amen see right that's why he said I indict this generation for the second crucifixion because the full word had been birthed into manifestation again and rejected once the seals was opened the full word right he's predicting it here and we see it coming see and um me just uh hit this a note here from the church age book said no for in every age the church has been governed by hierarchy a priesthood and Apostolic secession yeah closing the door of mercy and Grace To whom it will and instead of assuming the love and responsibility of the church it has with mercenary lust prayed upon her and destroyed her the clergy lived in luxury while the poor Church fed on the husk of abuse yeah now then he goes on I'm skipping down a little bit here but um he shows how that every denomination has the same Spirit every denomination swears that it has the key to the government of Christ uh uh government of the church every denomination claims to open the door but that is not true it is Jesus alone he sets the members in the body he endows them with their Ministries he puts the gifts at her disposal he cares for her he guides her she is his sole property and he has no other one but her right amen if the denomination send you let him take care of you but if God sends you he'll provide for you he has no one but her God's whole purpose is the church he said in the message knoweth is not knoweth it not his whole purpose purpose now see this three-fold purpose of God revealed he preached the opening of the seals uh in March and then here he comes back in in in July the seventh month Christ the mystery it's just like a continuation of the seventh seal and he talks about that great secret amen it was once hid in the back part of God's mind he said but now in the heart of his believing children right down into the church oh made known see and he said uh it's in every type that's in the Bible what is it it's the coming of the Lord Glory see it's that great climax it's that thing that Jesus said no man knoweth y right save the father only not even the son at that time see right oh my now you all know the seventh seal uh any mystery has a element or any you know uh of uh mystery to it despite the Revelation thereof and so part of this uh seventh seal see the activity is taking place on Earth right that's why one of the reason why there's silence in heaven the activity is down here amen see now St John 3 here he is on Earth standing on the roof rooftop talking to to uh Nicodemus and said uh no man ascendeth up up into heaven save he who come down from heaven even the son of man who is now in heaven and here he is standing on Earth yeah brother BR said I put that riddle before my church yeah said showed that he was the omnipresent God Amen am that's right oh my amen how is he here then he's here in word form he's here in spirit form amen he was in body form then but today his body is the bride but we'll meet him in the body form in the air oh how wonderful see kind just changed back around a little bit today to hide yourself from the eyes of the wise and prent see morphia God masking himself in uh the second Eve way the prophet called us the second Eve the bride but this eve will not be deceived she will come to this maturity that she's ordained to come to oh my she'll stay with the word Now Eve see now just one word now I I had some other little quotes here but maybe the Lord uh is leading in another littleit different direction I'm just going to paraphrase some things here and then you search it out but in the message Harvest Time okay in the message Harvest Time brother Brenham said that you don't have to get this I'm just going to throw it back behind me here uh brother brandom said that man's Eternal destination is determined right there's where it's determined by one word right right am I have a little section of chain and I've got a weak Link in it you just cut it and then just have a link in the middle you know and then when you pull it it'll come apart and I'll being overseas and different places I'll use that chain and have my interpreter hold the other end of it I said now you brace yourself maybe sometimes the platform will be 3 4 foot high and I'll swing out over the platform holding that chain yeah I said now remember as the prophet said your soul is hanging over Hell by the chain of God's word and no chain is any stronger than its weakest link one word is all Eve missed right exactly amen what am I saying in order for you to come to full maturity you got to stay with the word and if you ever left the word you better come back to it is that right amen you got to Mary and Joseph did in order to bring that see he was just 12 years old he had some more maturing to do and they had a lot more maturing to do too we we heard Mary this morning said she had a lot more maturing to do is that right she had to she had to go to the cross with Jesus she had to go to Pentecost right amen with John right that Jesus put her under the headship of John then she had to go over to the church of Ephesus and help John get the word compiled oh my bringing that word SE to maturity but the emphasis on the word watering them camels you know it's going to carry her that's right oh my see are you still with [Music] me oh my what an hour to be living in amen see now I'm just going to refer to some of these things and you can search it maybe if nothing else I'll wh your appetite when I paraphrase something uh that means I'm not quoting it verbatim but you'll find the same truth you understand be saying the same thing maybe in a different way right okay but you go search it out now here Jesus coming in and uh uh he had the disciples get this little uh donkey that had never been rode on by man before right oh the bystanders might have said oh we're going to have Rodeo now we're going to see a rodeo yeah and but you know what they done they took the garments off the disciples Y and that anointing on them disciples was now on the donkey and the donkey becomes covered with God's dresswear brother brandham said God's dresswear is Apostles prophets evangelist pastors and teachers exactly so God gets a straddle the Creator gets a straddle of his creation and he rides right into his creation right on the dresswear of the fold Ministry amen sure did sure brother BR said that's what's going on right now you know brother BR was part of the five-fold ministry oh yes he was oh he was more than that too but he was still part of it amen you're I'm right in here with you he said sure amen oh my now not to lower his elevation or anything you understand what I'm saying but see I'm identified right in there with you that's what's going on right now Apostles prophets evangelists pastors and teachers amen sure so Christ now riding on this donkey what you're looking at here's a donkey just a donkey now what if that donkey you know what oh that donkey never been dressed like that before he was a donkey of the cloth now I'm talking about a man of the cloth and you know what you know who's riding on me my if that donkey had any Horse Sense he had donkey sense now he didn't have Horse Sense he he didn't try to elevate himself up to something higher horse a little bit higher than donkey he stayed humble donkey didn't have horse sits and he sure didn't have no human sense but if he had had natural human sense he thought oh my look at me you he'd throw them ears back you know and they're say hosanna in the highest hosanna in the highest they're talking about me and you know what they wouldn't even let that donkey's hoofs Hit the Dirt or the Cobblestone exactly they put the rest of the disciples garments up there for him to walk on right and then when he' walk on that section had run behind him and get put him in front again and Palm leaves was broke off for him to walk on boy don't you know he did I'm something else now i' I've been elevated yeah and all these glory and the highest and hosana he could have really if he had the human sense but no he just subjected himself right he didn't Buck he didn't snort right exactly he was bringing that word right wasn't he see he was bringing the word he was just you know try to get yourself out the way as he were the word right right see he wasn't exalted above measure right he stayed in his place abely amen amen but now the king riding in to his kingdom the Creator coming into his creation right amen what is the attraction that day in Jerusalem right oh who is this what's taking place brother BR say it's just a little bitty handful that recognized he was the Messiah right right rest of them was saying who is this what's going on just a little bit handful was saying hosana th son of David they recognize that history is being fulfilled Zechariah 9 and9 their King was coming right and all the rest of them just got infuriated and jealous is that right right and then the discip or the Pharisees and everything say tell them shut up don't you know that they're making too much noise here and they're calling you the king he said listen if I made them shut up the rocks and the mountains would start crying out why the rocks of the mountains would have to recognize their creator now we look at Joshua Joshua was a great man he had great faith and he made the sun stand still and the Moon Over the Valley agel but you know what blind barus off the beaten path brother B said Jesus did not hear the words of barus but he heard the noise barus did of Jesus and his disciples in the crowd coming yeah now it was a little different day not while he's on the donkey but Jesus one day was passing through there and z uh barus said who is that and they said why it's Jesus coming oh he begin to holler he's blind he's way off off the beaten path but he heard about it and he began to cry out in his heart and he began to cry out with his voice oh th son of David have mercy upon me oh th son of David have mercy upon me right nobody heard him Jesus somebody heard him but Jesus didn't brother man said but here they are all lot of noise way up on the road somewhere and all of a sudden Jesus Stood Still right everybody else is moving and but Jesus Stood Still amen only place in the Bible right Jesus Stood Still right exactly right now I want you to see something here Joshua stopped the creation by his faith right but barus by his faith stopped the Creator himself is that right am one stopped the Su in the other stop the here is the creator of the son himself and his faith stopped him and he got what he was wanting exactly is that right he got his healing got his Deliverance right oh my that was before the cross folks right if he could do that before the cross what can we do after the cross oh my before the atonement was even made what can we do with our little faith today amen see we need to see this word coming to full maturity that's right think about it what was the attraction down there in Jerusalem prophecy being fulfilled right and then brother Brandon preaching on this and he said what taking place what was the attraction on Mount Sunset right what was the attraction on Mount Sunset he said three years ago this was a prophecy but now it's history right right am hallelujah what happened on Mount Sunset right three years ago S as this the time he says that's what he's referring back to that message he preached serves is the time see that's where he proph predicted it prophesied it 3 years ago this was prophecy now it's history right what's history the prophecy has been fulfilled this day the scripture is fulfilled what was it Christ coming back into his church again hallelujah oh my yes coming back the full word birth in and manifestation right amen never a greater anointing he said all my Ministry than for the opening of this word the come on oh my right think about it something happened with God in Simplicity and humility opening those seals amen and they didn't even recognize what had happened right amen that's right think about it all my Ministry like uh Waters rivers of water singular Rivers plural different anointings one anointing for the healing of the sick first PLL second pull another anointing for the Discerning and the thoughts the in his heart great anointing but he said in all my Ministry I've never reached into a realm like this what's the third pull for the opening of the word the revealing of the word who is the word Christ is the word see oh bringing back the word see so you can have the word to overcome with letting that word bring you to maturity am amen see oh yes yes then he could say you know the bride has thus said the Lord that's right she has the word of the Lord she has the mind of Christ and she knows what he wants done with that word amen amen see it takes the mind of Christ to know what he wants done with the word of Christ right now in that also he put it like this we have the answer to the devil's question now I don't want to sound like a show off up here but if the prophet said we have the answer to the devil's question I want to identify with that we I want to identify with that we so we might be a wee little bunch you know zachus was a we little man I still want to be identified with that little we right we see the bride she sh sh she has thus say the Lord and we have the answer to the devil's question and that's what the devil is howling about because his his tactics has been exposed and when the devil is exposed he's powerless talk about exposed those seals absolutely did you realize the first four seals was just exposing the devil in those the form of those first uh four horses and the Riders of the first four horses sure he just exposing what he had done and what he's going to do and so forth amen we see that's what the devil is howling about he said we have the answer to the devil's question and he goes on to say what is it in that sense it's the headship of the word back in the church once again am the headship of the word see back see this headship right see remember uh the cloud right see when those seven angels ascended it Formed that white wig right what was it showing the headship amen and in that same message Christ the mystery he said oh the headship and the body has become one unit right not did not will has right right amen that's right in other words Christ himself has come to take control see is it not written the government shall be upon her shoulders right his shoulders brother B said what is his shoulders it's the church on Earth God's Earthly strength the strongest part of the body on the earth is his church his shoulders amen and the government shall be upon his shoulders the church amen God's Earthly strength he has no no hands but yours right see no hands but mine and feet see oh my what is it again in morphia God hiding himself in a humble little group of people that Malachi for produced do you realize that we are the very manifestation of Malachi 4 the very fruit of the ministry of Malachi for we are his victory that's right oh oh this is the very proof that Malachi 4 didn't fall or fail right the word coming to maturity oh my I wish you all would preached me a little bit brother Dale said uh brother Wade said why don't you just turn loose tonight they sure make you feel free here and uh I I appreciate that but again I don't want to dump the whole Lo to one little sheep one time one [Music] second oh my is the Lord good to us word come to maturity God's not willing that You' be exalted above measure God's not willing see Power without character is what power without character that's what Lucifer has permitted to be exalted above measure and there and there's no Redemption for Angels no nowhere in the Bible you find any Redemption for Angels Fallen Angels No Redemption they can't sing Amazing Grace they don't do you realize you're made on a higher order than Angels what would God hear the quickest brother B ask the question uh uh Angels or a son of God with the word of God you said a son of course angels are only ministering Spirits sent forth to minister unto us who are heirs angels are not Hees come on we are the heirs that's right brother was singing this morning or last night maybe was I'm going to take a trip and a good old gospel if you're ashamed of me I'm still in eror see we need to recognize what we got who we are where we come from where we're going we got to be able to say just like Jesus did I come from God and I go back to God and we need to recognize that our origin is our destiny Y when you realize your roots where you come from you know where you're going oh my yes that's right oh my yes listen do you realize then as this Bride come to maturity and um then she recognizes that the abstract title deed has been placed back in her hands you know when he redeemed the book exactly he didn't redeem it for himself our kinsman redeemer redeemed it for his church right right amen and he didn't keep it for himself he handed it into the hands of his family he done it for his family put it in the hands and the five identifications of the third pull showed it was back in the hands of man again right just like it was 2,000 years ago nature was controlled the storm is that right the resurrection right all of these things was manifested showing the third pull is among us at the end of Christ the mystery said the end end of look at the clock 2:00 for those of you spiritual he said the end of the second poll well if that was the end of the second poll he said also the third PO is at hand seventh month of 65 uh 63 63 July 63 the third pull is at hand then later he showed how it was the third pole was identified Among Us and all these things see y amen now we just see a little bit of it you understand right as compared with what it will be amen when the squeeze begins to come I I don't know about you all but I seem like we're feeling a little bit of squeeze oh my but you know if the third pull is at hand it's still Among Us it's still here don't live at the Holy One of Israel amen that's right what is the third pull identify with the new ministry right which is Matthew or or Mark 1122 if you say under this mouth right amen well brother brandham spoke to a whole chain of mountains is that right and they're all going into the ocean be thou removed and be thou cast into the sea it's got to happen folks it's got to happen it's going to happen thus sayth the Lord amen sure when I don't know but it's it's going to happen amen amen and uh whatever your Mountain might be if you'll just speak to it and believe a desire in your heart see when you pray believe it's already happening believe it's happening just soon as you pray your ass already happening that's right see perfect Faith the faith of God might just be one little grain of sand moving from that mountain don't you doubt don't you look at the circumstance perfect Faith looks at the promise never the circumstance that's right is that right that's right you'll have whatsoever thing you desire right amen all the Simplicity yes sir now what am I saying coming down to a close here tonight so be with me just a little bit longer give your undivided attention in my 20 years of uh talking with the angel of the Lord and uh the pillar fire uh that would have been 5 3 53 I believe 33 43 53 1953 in um Jesus Christ the same yesterday day and forever I believe it is but brother said in my 20 years of talking with the angel of the Lord yeah and and the and the pillar fire and so forth he said I've learned two things stands out he said that's faith and love Faith and love and when faith and love gets married you can ask what you will right right ain't that what we're looking at here right faith on the bottom love on the top when that becomes one unit amen ask what you will sir that's for every individual he ask what you will sure what's that with the third pull working SE sure heyen oh my marriage see but there has to be a marriage in the maturity see the maturity he wants me to come to maturity he wants you to become to when I was a child I spake as a child I understood as a child but when I become a man he wants us to put away childish things he wants us to put away these childish things you know amen why because that which is perfect is come that's right amen right it's a perfect interpretation of the word of God with Divine Vindication isn't it wonderful to realize amen oh my brother my sister thank you Jes am in closing Jesus see was the Passover Lamb right and there they left him there the Overcomers the elected ones who had the responsibility of bringing the word of maturity left the word the Passover Lamb himself at the Feast of Passover where Jerusalem God's only provided place of worship in that day there they left him and only as they return to the word y amen but when we come back now every generation has opportunity for a fresh and new Revival and every fresh and true Rev Bible comes when men and women boys and girls have gotten back to the word of God their age if there's any portion I'm closeing my Bible if there's any portion of this word that you spurn or that you have left or you're not giv preeminence to right remember those that threefold purpose first to reveal your then to gain the preeminence and then to restore back one three-fold purpose and this is the great mystery yep that's it but we must let him have the preeminence it's got to be to the place like the little boy when he went into the blacksmith shop and his daddy had a an old cold horseshoe over there and he took the tongs and put it in the fire on those hot coals and you know that old black horseshoe turned white hot just like the coal all around it and the little boy said daddy where is the Horseshoe is the fire in the Horseshoe or is the Horseshoe in the fire and that's the way it's got to be with you and I we've got to be so in tune with God in such a Harmony and so fill of the spirit of God Amen to where he has the preeminence did you know one place here when brother BR was preaching on that he said the church has the preeminence right because he and the church is one oh oh my see it's okay for you to have the preeminence if you're surrendered to him and one man one woman one boy one girl one man fully surrendered into the hand of God is omnipotent right do you know what I was teaching that very same thing I said that to a an old veteran in Lithuania B news Lithuania one of the former Soviet Satellites and you know he he miss he he he couldn't believe it he couldn't accept that yeah I said do you know the prophet said that one man fully surrendered now fully surrendered don't forget that part one man fully surrendered in the hand of God is omnipotent right abolutely talk about full yes sir you know what that same man called me a communist he did hey D he call me a [Laughter] com I love him anyway I love you oh my glory that's true though man right do you believe that the we can be so mature in the word come on see sure we have to come on up come on up a little

or something Isaiah Isaiah 52 you know Isaiah is a Bible in itself just by itself but 52 and8 y you all love this I know you've probably seen it before but just something stood out uh in this to me Isaiah 52 and eight here it is thy Watchman now he's talking about God's Watchman in the context not talking about the devil's sh Shepherd thy Watchman shall lift up the voice right with the voice together shall they sing right for they shall see eye to eye when the Lord shall bring again Zion right restoration any time you see the daughter Zion brother talk said it's talking about the bride

abolished amen that's old timers that makes you throw your shoulders back a little bit oh my I see a few gray whiskers and and gray heads around here they say when you hit 40 you know you don't start you don't exactly lose your hair it just starts coming out your nose and ears and it makes you look pretty pretty crude and unusual but oh we don't have anything to worry about we haven't lost to one of them have we they're all right there waiting for us and God by his own faith has already seen you in a glorified body if you doubt your own faith that's okay but don't doubt God's faith he already said it he only gives one faith is that right oh those he has for new predestinated also and then he called him then he justified him and he hath already glorified it's a finished work in the mind of
