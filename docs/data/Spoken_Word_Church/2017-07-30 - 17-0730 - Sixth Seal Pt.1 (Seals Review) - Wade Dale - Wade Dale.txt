prominent brother Quinn will be coming back with are coming here Saturday next Saturday and he'll be speaking Sunday and brother his name is Rolando Genesis he was with brother context but he was with

would just break one because they're going to be traveling around and doing I need peace minute I don't have my braces they become damaged depending with it we need to know slower good water holiday where your rights are right upstairs when I used it up there all right so let's cover just to just to background a little bit because let's start with six seals fifth seal remember we're going to read it right here big deal and we had opened the fifth seal I saw under the altar the souls of them that were slain for the word of God and for the testimony which they held right and they cried with a loud voice saying how long O Lord holy and true dost thou not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth and white robes were given unto every one of them we'll send the demo that you dressed for a little season until their fellow-servants also and their brethren which that means it's the same people okay that should be killed as they were should be fulfilled now we saw that that fit seal we know one thing's for sure there was no combat beast that said come and see come look all the other seals one two three and four and when you open the fourth seal I heard the voice of the fourth beast say come and see I heard the voice of the third beast say come and see I heard the voice of the second beep now we know those combat beasts or what - man Eagle so this fourth one is the Eagle that fourth beast would be Eagle come see and healed them the fourth seal or so jointed write it down I don't want to say open it but he he give it to John Choi debriding alright then we look right here and we see him when he open when he who he's a lamb we know we know cracked his jaw one he can open a seat okay he's the only one who can open the ceiling right and when he had opened the fifth seal I saw under the old offer he immediately sees something he doesn't have to go through a combat B so we know one thing's for sure there was no combat beef so the prophet of God tells us that on the fourth seal that the rapture takes place okay that's to take place on the fourth seal because what is the four combat beta the holy oh right the believer the Holy Ghost in the believer is the louts man an eagle so it so the property guy goes one thing for sure there's no combat base so the bribe was the Holy Ghost must be gone somewhere cuz there's no combat beast to say John coming three because immediately John looks and like I said he looks into another dimension okay he walked he steps into another dimension in he sees I saw it wasn't that the for combat beasts led him anywhere he saw in other words his revelation had come waste now I'm not saying he didn't need to come back big but he to me John having the baptism of the Holy Ghost he has those combat bees inside of him dr. maestra eagle but he did have the eagle in northern because he was a prophet and he was looking at things that man's done well that was written 2,000 years ago the man still talking about it now but when he opened the fifth seal I saw under the altar another dimension the souls of them that were slain for the word of God so there somewhere not in this dimension so he had this he had to by revelation go into another dimension right so now we show to that just for just for background just vowels been a little bit and several one but look when we went through these seals so this is the way I see the seals the seals were given for the redemption of the body the seventh seal is not for redemption of the salt Jesus Christ died at Calvary for the redemption of yourself the purchase for that Nikko he purchased you a gallery right he probably purchased the whole thing expected okay but it hasn't been applied but one of the seals break God's getting ready to apply it to a group of people is that all right okay all right don't want to get the fridge in here - let me get back still sent oh come on no not not here not here a ban we got up there to go bro all right so we saw the first seal the first seal was the Alliance anointing they're not lying Ryan li oen lyin okay we see the revelation one true and living God because we see the first deal with a white horse rider riding out away from something and he was false but he had to be riding away from something that's true okay and many people teach the sealed is just the revelation of the Antichrist sure it makes him known but I thought it was the revelation of Jesus coming okay because Jesus Christ is going to change our body number that that is totally contrary to what he wants to do okay that's why the seals have to be a revelation it's not just reading not just the ability to read like the properties are pity to that your ability to read right okay but we want to see the revelation the hidden part the mystery so we see truly that the white horse shows now we're going to talk about this for just second because we'll go over it again there is three stages of the new birth right judge occasion sanctification about digital Holy Ghost gives you the new birth right I believe that I don't believe you just was born here with it I believe you had to go through these three stages yeah go run around and get your home which is the wonderful three to future home he says the herb goes through the same thing and he said thank God I taught this when I was young and I'm still teaching it now is these three stages of grace yeah okay which is justification sanctification the baptismal holy go right so how does it ties into the sealed well justification when that white horse rider rode away from whatever that was he rode away from that whoever that is see you got sin - it's great he's all I have a good prophet that's good it's got to have to meet that wild horse rider which is the falseness appearing real appearing right has got right away what was that is that that in other words what is happening Satan has listen he's here now he's all around you but if you're born again he's not in you he can't catch your soul but he can touch your body in your spirit ring right okay through memory reason conscience faith imaginations that's our problem we have too much memory reading conservation and that's what bothers us right okay I sold of the bother me if I'm going all right it is sealed off train can't get in that's right Gogol back out dynamo back out right it will go free to begin stop already well when you see the great when you see the seals oh when you see them in this way kind of reader tell me one time when I did this someone for them he's right never mind I've heard okay freak on seals being you know a type of your Christian journey I said well what in the hell everyday is you think it was you know me did you think brother and preach the greatest message of his whole life in Greek seven seals and it was to reveal the devil please people call degrees then this message a long time we got to get we got to get down to the to do it's like a total brotherhood yesterday we get to the essence of the message right you heard me say that one hundred thousand job if the end this right here Paul said okay to you the letter right if I have if I had a good one on him I'll kill you and that a rafter nobody right that'll say nobody but the revelation contained in this will Raptors and gets out here so we're looking at your revelation so now I'm promise you one thing all these people saying I'm wrong here and there you try taking it back to the Bible he was a byproduct and if you can't put it in the Bible yourself if you have to say brother Reynolds is all the time you're in trouble yeah go say you can say the same identical and that's what he's doing with all these doctors will rather Brown said well brother Rumson yeah okay well what did Jesus said eat my flesh and drink my blood and then he left yeah and it's an Apollo about ten years before he wrote grampians and explained was using prophet they bowled over that for ten years because somebody had a revelation today he's talking about the communion and then eat my flesh drink my bloody walked away come on now he walks you somebody walked up read that you know the Messiah tell you that you'd be worn at your numbers I promise you but the revelation has come though the seals have opened so that we can be into these things and eNOS the seals are for the redemption of the body because everything else is ready yes your soul if you're both now that's a big word little word the thing where if you're born again your soul is just any kernel is gone you got the new birth you've got the word working in your life you're heading toward a body change right but your body and just have to be James we literal I've been remaindered that would be somebody like I told that brother yesterday I said the resurrection message was not spoken by dead people dead people can't speak resurrection it has to be alive somebody not one person but a live body right to declare the resurrection He is risen was not told by their people right it will cold somebody alive all right so it was a lot of word that went somewhere so we got down with a live word to what bring the sixth dimension here bring all the dead Saints here and it's in Christ like I said yesterday you should see it watch these little analogies because we know that Boaz type Christ right yeah Ruth with a mole like she talked to us and then the only her mama was an older lady she topped Israel right old Israel Solo has dandruff sure he did the right of redemption he what'd he do he purchased Naomi's land right right he got Ruth the Gentile bride but now that's not the end of the story they produce a child that's right and they handed that child right back to Naomi the old is rule Act what we gotta do we don't just birth Christ we gotta give him back to the Jews without giving back to old Israel so that what so the debt can be fulfilled right the 1260 days of preaching of a part of the day in 70 weeks all right according to the Bible 1250 days of preaching to bring the hundred forty-four thousand and give them the new birth mhm but also it's going to help get these people out what roads were given to the Fitz's you right so now let's get back to what we were talking about this per second then we'll we might not get anywhere but we background I'm never going to be able fresh by next Sunday police turn on the sick seal so now the first seal what is justification chopping off your past sins in other words what happened when that white horse rider rode away he rode away that was your sin that's right riding away okay now now remember though this gasification baby form we call it beta form justification jumped off your past sins but once you did you continue to do right give me this one that thing from Sonny says the things I used to do I do them no more that is correct that's a new birth because you get justified yeah those things are gone and in the stem does forgetfulness buddy you're going to keep sinning because one it made your sin is still here that's right yeah so the things I used to do I feel good that's a in digest McCadden all right but not born again okay so here the justification the white horse wash off your walk white lighten up your bass in red three ready to fly right so the wild horse now we come and see the opening of the second seal which was the Ox flavoring and what was off opps with a sacrifice and what did he do when they sacrifice that it was a blood sacrifice so what a sanctification always represent is the blood cleansing all right sanctification their clean spirit goes out of a man and book there you know while to dry places and please rest - none comes back into the vessel because look even at sanctification the unclean spirit goes out okay you're heading towards something but guess what if you don't fill it with the Holy Ghost guessing it don't come back I won't make it real big legal breakdown of seven of his buddies with it right and if I was is the state of the man is worse than when he got started that's why I tell you sanctification is one of them worse places to stay Jose I'll tell you you got it your friends will tell you you got it how many people have even in the message so why don't you know you're boarding in LA quit drinking smoking and I started going to church dang I knew what the hole was that fun of that dismal ocean not one thing same though their woman he goes dirt when you don't yeah that one ended here when you're not here easier when you're late oh that's for me so he says he can he can mimic all those things but he cannot be filled with the holy because remember Judas was in this condition but now let's go back to the truth though cause when you're truly sanctified the word cleans you out that's the rate members of the first seal that's why red right black and gristle are our mingle table right okay now so you've got your white writers listen if you're justified and you got dropped off you pass them and you pass away for requests from there you're made like you're given eternal life you're not to ride to be given eternal life okay but now listen nobody in this room will fall under that so you've lost that part of privilege sorry you know too much you go do Mario during your journey - just say why just got my sins dropped off and if I die tomorrow okay no now you know too much but we move on to the next seal break it which is the second seal which is what I said read the Red Horse symbolize what red is always strength defying cleansing the odds remember that what the red heifer right the red and brings it down with us just the part number the red half rule is do the red heifer could only have three hairs in a horrible body beep like very different color that's why they're trying to replicate that off now or the red heifer off center day they're trying to replicate the red heifer right and because Israel know that I have it for sacrifice code it was the waters of separation it was a sanctifying factor but God says the Holy Ghost burns all that out with what sanctification husband spirit goes out right that was that red horse rider riding away you say the word you ride ride away from you this elder to you that's right he's riding away from you because it says right here look well and what was did to know something could come see you over the white horse and he to sell another boat he went forward he went forward do you laugh wherever he was residing he left we're going to use this alright yes all right the second one was red I'm trying to cover a bunch of stuff at one time but just something that's food for thought for next time because we got to raise up a little bit higher because remember this justification and this justification we are explained it's two different it's the same but it has two different places in your vineyard and your journey right using thanks vacations the opposite now we'll go to the currency third beat with what man intelligence all right the intelligence of man now here comes an uber then you say well what's that got to do with black because it was white red and black horse black horse well if you have the new birth today you're a dead person that's right you're dead if any part oh you alive then the things I used to do I still do but the things I used to do I do them no more coat the Deuter is not in there and this goes on refrigerator by the way round one to explain that distilled over pre-draft it's the only thing it just sticks on refrigerator door pickled up now thank you very appreciate that I'm sure Gabby has a lot to do with that she smiles its own though thank you sister Gabby for giving it to Ryan three years of me okay I think he's got several over to give to other people in anyway the third seal was the third base which was the man annoying remember that come under Lutheran Wesley the intelligence the literal intelligence which put books together and we had a great time after the after the Dark Ages coming out of the Dark Ages into the intelligence of man but you have a dead nature you have to be dated right now your shows not black you can't top up but you guys the old you must be black black and out dead gone and then and then what this comes the new man the new birth the things I used to do I do them no more that new person comes in the person of the Holy Ghost comes in and what kills your own nature right fur seal so we're killing the old nature and now you're born again you're just as eternal as God is in your soul but she doesn't stop that he's all brother what about the fourth seal with a fourth seal here's why pale horse now why is the pale horse and I told you I took paint you take white paint red paint and black paint and mix it together you get a period chunky ugly pale color but if you take the justification of sanctification and the baptism of a whole adult in you ply the word to it you get that mixture and it may look pale to the world and it may look bad to them but not to me and you the glorious time because we come now to remember the fourth seal the rapture takes place there's a body change take place in that for seven why because the word has been bought may live that pale horse rider is death and he'll you know boy you can't take a body change with death and he'll residing here death and he'll got to leave all right man now becomes as a fifth seal which we were just on there's no combat be so the rapture takes place in the fourth seal it's in another dimension at that point in time white robes were given they were all Jewish because it was their brethren all right because brother Graham cities did all the sawing the officer the soldiers in were slammed with work on for the testimony was to help he said they didn't have the testimony of Jesus Christ because they didn't believe you to drive with my father but God give that why this seal for me is the greatest showing of grace he give the new birth to a group of people they didn't even know who he was but because of what happened because Boaz looking at Naomi he didn't want her he had to redeem her to get Ruth that's we blinded the eyes of the do to get his Gentile bride but he didn't forget that Naomi you didn't forget that purchase in other words the referee gave it right back to her but he gave her a job then she couldn't have these these are here just haven't you birth while roads were given after they did I mean because if you don't get the new birds and you burp it's a new birth of a new person inside of a live person it's not in it you can't get the new birth after you did you stuff em unless you have to be given eternal life right in our purchase on this side it's the purchased possession that we have on this side but if we die without the new part we've got to we've only got one hope and that ain't very much I guarantee you I know what it is though the Bible tells you says you will be judged by your words I don't ever want to be goodbye my work you read it revelations when the books are open those people are judged by their work don't ever let me be doing my work they're filthy rags I felt this one homicidal happen alright so this is the great seal because he's giving eternal life to a group of people that don't even want it amen it's the first revelation for the body change to this justification times two because remember if he looks and sees these people in the form that they're in on the earth he can't kill he's got a killer that's right but he literally listened he literally has to look through the blood and see this group of people and it got me some white somewhere there's got to be some sort of justification that he gives these people right sees as the justification because the real them whatever did it hey Naomi was a Jew okay she didn't deny that she was Jewish she had an inheritance right but she lost it I'm in the Bible she lost the inheritance right did you block their inheritance because God told them in the old days would your met a lot I'm married to you Israel but I'm going to divorce you because you went whoring in the world all the things of the world I won't divorce you but I'm not going forget you that's right he divorced her to take the Gentile bride beautiful time beautiful time but this is justification time to brother Ron said I'm leaving soon maybe I think I want sex I don't want to be wrong but he says there's a higher form of justification there's a higher form of sanctification because it's justification only chopped off your past things I did but this justification right here the real you didn't do that if you didn't do it at all sit as if they never feel Jesus Christ because if he had to look down not through the blood and see these people he has to kill they put him on the cross but looking through the blood he sees that the in other words this is why I say if God has not blinded rhymes will never come in and God did not blinded her eyes that are never putting a little cross and they would have took a rafter and they went to bed no Daniel seventy weeks whether it was a tent out in the middle it would have been able to took their rapture they would have had their 50th Jubilee and they were the start in the Millennium not just way out there okay I know that's way that we see it here so but he had to break it so that we could come in you know the 1970 weeks you see those two brackets you know you see the turk ages well if you slide them together that's all the Israel we were injected because Ruth was married in a mall that woman was married into she was she had no inheritance genuine herebut but she was part of Naomi's family by marriage and that's who both had was hired he wanted Rose didn't want Naomi but he knew had to redeem though now let me give her okay I just to me it's a wonderful thing it's a fifth seal it's a special group of people because this is all Jewish will file a new birth we're all Jewish men we're all Jews by birth a new birth that's right okay and so what the grace that they did that's what we get so the fifth seal is to me is a feel of grace that that there's unmerited favor there's nothing these people did they're earning her life now listen there's nothing you did either you're just like this fifty of you you put him on the cross a man but being a Gentile we accept the cross and him being the Messiah they have it right that's the difference but it's still taught the same way you and I you know Christ along your crime you did not grow up in your life going for welcome Jesus in my life no they think I did it they taught the things I did right all right I did over and over without Apple in the world I liked it right yeah you know why cause it giver wasn't there to turn me around but one day he spoke and I asked you and the things I used to do I'm doing tomorrow paper so see the seals is not just showing for horse riders and v build you know there's a there's an underlying meaning that we're not getting because it's been 60 years since he preached all right greatest man did you say - yellow priest and nobody can understand really what he said yeah some say it's close I'm sad to open I think that there's a tree if you say it's closed it's closed yeah keep that open it can be open to the Confessor because when you closed your mind off you can load the book I thought revelation 10 came with a bull go use the one it closed it back right all right God brought it over the opened the book all right for us to come in so here's the here's the lion ox man Eagle just gave the same case best in the whole goat and the word remember program and money and restorations of bribery he said four or four and I'm sorry for that for bug stage for bug stage well is it homework I can't ever give homework a word or caterpillar luggage okay for messengers eat it down well it's got to take for life messengers to bring it back up now we know in your birth is on this three-step process but you have to put that in there because if you're born again you will go straight through the word that's right that's right the word will be more important to you than ever go away some kid could catch them that is correct that to me that is to get that that caps it off for you in your soul is that the word continues to be made alive sure we have a route some men yeah I love what some might say the other day said it takes two valleys you make one level so you guys don't think twice as many valleys it's too late 1002 to make one big mountain so you're gonna have to wife is being problem but there is the mountain back okay that's the mountain why the proper Harrington oh that's great it probably had to come number one because it's in the Bible number two the brother brother came because nobody ever I mean they just kind of went over the seals and class barking probably got clothes and this was not close but there was no perfect message until he came to bring a perfect message okay and he didn't bring it that's Bowl ad himself came amen to getting this right and I'm not saying we're different from the other bride but we are different from different from the prize because they're all and upgrade they don't have that word to get them out of the grade yet but we have enough work to get them out the grade hey come on come so sealed one three four one two three and four and then we have a rapture right you said well what's five six and seven oh well if we go to four CS and all this must be just used it is in its natural form you hear me naturally this is going to happen this is not a fancy land or something that might happen no it's going to happen there is that gives you somewhere in another dimension there's going to be giving eternal life and they gotta wait until their brethren is killed which is during this 1260 days then they're all going to come back into the Millennium I see that more now than ever that bit field you there cuz cuz the millennium is to the Jews and not to me in you somebody's asking somebody that sends a week so named Bob we're talking about you after look Dan same weeks to the Jews it doesn't matter if we have a green idea we're suffering we got time when I went on time anyway brother I understand there's a there's a marriage supper going on during this time right like I mean at the past eight weeks in the Bible says that there's one week left after the rapture I don't care what anybody says pretty our prophet he can't say any name Pastor Bible teacher make a covenant with many for what one week and brother Brown said that can't be Christ with those Christ's don't break covenants and he said we're here he said we've missed the record right if we're here when I coming up with the Jews it's made with endicott we've missed it so the rapture takes place in their blood well seven years one week go back to I will read it the other day Rachel and Jacob Jacob has a work seven years to get Rachel and he says he fulfil her week that's true listen brother grounders didn't get this he did pull this out of the air people okay it was in the Bible before he got here he just took a prophet just did what dig it out and make it known to the people that's what brother rounded he never he never had a hidden mystery in here remember they told him I said you with your revelation you can write a 23rd chapter revelation pieces that shout is it he said can't add one word can't take one word out all right so I and like I said forth I mean one song that you've got explained by level it is a Jewish time to millennium is to the Jew you and I are already eternal were eternal over here this one we're in new eternity with time it's no longer does but remember and Daniel it says what he said to my angel put one foot on land one foot on sea raised his hand to heaven and said for a time times and a dividing of time three and a half years to watch to finish the medicine Jesus Christ not to finish that's correct that's why if you don't get the sad damage in the week right you cannot place them in these seals okay not and people go bonkers anyway that your aspartate placed on the fourth day I bought five six and seven four five six and seven will lapse back over here already home care for the redemption of our body this is your soul Redemption this is your body redemption because it's going to take what grace it's going to take us realizing that they're real you didn't do it you have no more against you good morning in the mark you have now is what Satan is going through your brain with your memory reads incontinence I've spit all over myself all right did I have my header on use on how you here yesterday well this is good it ain't good that all right we like to have still have a little fun but we get into the sixth seal now we're heading toward something else we're heading towards sanctification times two and I say Thomas - yes just tell them higher form of single issue because the metropolises I died a there's a daily sanctification when there was still us as member of adèle some of the angular does this chair of the sermon wants to keep the worshipper Clinton keeps them clean don't make them clean blood Jesus Christ what makes you clean not an angel but that angel tastes the burner thanks to the cold off of the altar and what comes to every day and sanctifies you yes not your soul your soul just hardly done it sure it's your spirit that he's working on we ain't got that yet our soul is not up and down that's right I so it's not we believe the word one day and we know we see this know that your memories encaustic mental because brother Graham said you either favor valuing yourself there is no gray area is that it's already record even you're sold already Raptor synonym replaces it's already done finished completed there's not enough to be done amen but your spirit is what that burner comes through and burns that out that old what that old Fox is the old box that you have he burns them out all right so we'll get in a big sale and we'll read it next Sunday let's go that's great god bless yet [Music]
