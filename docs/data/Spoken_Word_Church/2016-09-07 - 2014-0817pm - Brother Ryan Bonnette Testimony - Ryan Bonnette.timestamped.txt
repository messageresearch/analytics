[0:00] pretty much different variations of all
[0:02] the same name right so I said hm
[0:04] something significant here I didn't know
[0:06] what I texted it out to several people
[0:07] Brooke texted me back said that name
[0:09] means pure p u r e and I thought hm
[0:13] that's neat sounds pretty two days later
[0:16] it finally struck me what that means
[0:18] look up pure it means untainted it means
[0:20] free from disease free from Ill see God
[0:24] he works through nurses he works through
[0:25] doctors he works through medicine but
[0:27] God is the Healer God was beginning to
[0:29] purify our baby from the severe lung
[0:30] disease beginning to draw it out of her
[0:32] because that was her diagnosis by this
[0:33] time was severe lung disease he was
[0:35] cleansing her and why four because three
[0:38] is a witness three would have got our
[0:39] attention but there were four of them
[0:42] don't get ahead of
[0:44] me now he's already got me figured out
[0:47] I'm sure four is God's number of
[0:49] Deliverance in the Bible there the
[0:50] children of Israel were 400 years in the
[0:52] land of Egypt in bondage when they were
[0:54] delivered that's right Lazarus was 4
[0:56] days in the grave when Jesus resurrected
[0:58] him and delivered him from Death right
[1:00] on
[1:02] and the children of Israel I'm sorry
[1:04] let's see the Hebrew children there you
[1:06] go he mentioned it this morning the
[1:07] three Hebrew children in the fiery
[1:09] furnace uh and the fourth man seen in
[1:11] that fire was their
[1:13] deliverer okay four is guys's number of
[1:15] Deliverance through four nurses whose
[1:17] name means pure which is a four-letter
[1:20] word God was beginning to purify her
[1:22] baby and cleanse her from the sickness
[1:24] and watch this she was born she was
[1:27] delivered from the womb if you will at
[1:28] four minutes till
[1:30] midnight and by the way a side note that
[1:33] was the best delivery best that gab's
[1:35] done so far everything went so smoothly
[1:36] I believe the other midwives were
[1:38] anointed but this time more than ever
[1:40] because I stand there praying you know I
[1:41] have to believe it and four minutes till
[1:44] midnight is when she was born she went
[1:46] into the NICU just a couple hours later
[1:48] and all day Saturday all day Sunday or
[1:51] excuse me all day uh Thursday Friday and
[1:53] Saturday she got worse worse and worse
[1:57] and Saturday night she was at the point
[1:58] of death but on the fourth day which was
[2:02] Sunday the Resurrection Day the day we
[2:04] honor and celebrate the resurrection God
[2:06] began to raise her and heal her from
[2:09] that
[2:13] sickness and I'm not done she's our
[2:15] fourth
[2:16] child and you know God delivered me from
[2:20] Fear on our fourth child
[2:23] Lord and she has a four-letter name IA
[2:28] her middle name is a four-letter name
[2:29] Jun
[2:31] now watch
[2:34] this what was the next thing I didn't
[2:36] write any of this down I just practiced
[2:38] it a
[2:38] lot four and four okay
[2:42] and uh my forgot it it'll come to
[2:47] me four and four all the four is in her
[2:50] name now watch she is her name
[2:54] means uh God is gracious did I say that
[2:57] at the start of it I don't remember God
[2:58] is gracious is what ia's name means it's
[3:01] a Hebrew name God is gracious and all
[3:03] through this trial God was gracious not
[3:04] only to deliver me but gracious to
[3:07] deliver her from the sickness God's
[3:09] grace was manifested over and over and
[3:11] over amen and
[3:14] um and there was just so many other
[3:17] things just one thing after another I'm
[3:19] trying to jog my memory because there
[3:20] was four I know there was another four
[3:22] in there uh but God was gracious and let
[3:25] it be said of IA from this day forward
[3:28] whenever you think of IA remember that
[3:30] God is gracious to to deliver God's
[3:33] grace is sufficient to
[3:35] deliver okay and um if I remember that
[3:39] other thing I'll just have to come back
[3:40] up and say it later oh yeah here it is
[3:42] oh it's a big one hang
[3:44] on it's a big one see anytime God gives
[3:47] you something The Devil Makes You doubt
[3:49] it so immediately after this the devil's
[3:51] making me doubt and I said okay big boy
[3:53] we'll see you come the next trial we'll
[3:54] find out if I got delivered from fear or
[3:57] not the next trial came a couple weeks
[3:59] later it was last Sunday morning brother
[4:00] Quinn was preaching Ula laid there on
[4:03] her back
[4:05] asleep and Gabby and the girls were in
[4:07] the bathroom and and uh the devil
[4:09] thought H this pretty good opportunity
[4:10] to sneak in and cause some Mischief
[4:12] cause some trouble I was holding IA my
[4:14] hands were tied okay and YULA was laying
[4:16] there on her back asleep and her arms
[4:18] began to flail like this about once
[4:21] every second with the heartbeat you know
[4:24] and she was asleep now I thought maybe
[4:26] it's just a nightmare but it'll just go
[4:28] away but no she kept doing it and then I
[4:30] noticed she's not breathing so I went up
[4:32] to raise her up she was just as limp as
[4:33] could be not breathing she opened her
[4:36] eyes and her her eyelids okay and her
[4:38] eyes were rolled back in her head she
[4:39] was having a FAL seizure her seizure had
[4:42] spiked it was up to 103.5 and she was
[4:44] not breathing now I just all I did I
[4:47] handed off the baby to Terrence and and
[4:50] took Ula picked her up and carried her
[4:51] out and said Lord bless my baby and no
[4:53] sooner than I did that that she coughed
[4:55] all that out and she began to breathe
[4:57] and it was in just within moments the
[4:59] brother Aaron a whole host of other
[5:00] people and our two of our church staff
[5:02] nurses were out there assessing her
[5:04] people are surrounding us with prayer
[5:06] and and praise and it wasn't too long
[5:08] after that she came out of that and
[5:09] she's perfectly normal and well right
[5:11] now but here's the thing I didn't
[5:19] fear I just simply went and picked her
[5:21] up and acted I just prayed and carried
[5:23] her out and said Lord if you take my
[5:24] baby she's yours the lord giveth and
[5:27] Lord blesses the way the lord giveth and
[5:28] lord taketh way bless the name of the

[13:11] in bring them
[13:14] in bring a little to
[13:21] Jesus amen and amen and
[13:24] amen that's what we do we bring the
[13:27] little ones to Jesus
[13:30] you know a lot of churches they do
[13:32] different things but remember in the
[13:35] scripture they brought the little
[13:37] children that's right to Jesus and he
[13:40] blessed them yep right it's not a thing
[13:45] that we call it a baptism or anything
[13:47] it's just a basis that we bring them to
[13:49] the Lord we hand them into the hands of
[13:51] the
[13:53] Lord and ask the Lord to take care of
[13:56] them that's right right he's been
[13:58] gracious to have done all so far so we
[14:01] know he'll finish the day but how do we
[14:04] also
[14:05] do we also do one thing the family
[14:11] standing see when we come to a baby
[14:13] dedication it's a little bit different I
[14:15] guess and most people and like I said
[14:17] it's not an infant doing things it's not
[14:20] a saying they're saved or anything it's
[14:22] just we've come to dedicate them to the
[14:24] Lord give them into the hands of the
[14:26] Lord and then you know what they would
[14:29] take them to Jesus he'd bless them he'd
[14:31] give them right back to them cuz you
[14:32] know who raised the children Jesus
[14:35] didn't raise the children it was the
[14:37] people the ones around that raised and
[14:40] we always say even to the
[14:42] church that everybody in this church
[14:44] today is
[14:46] a a people that are dedicated to one
[14:49] thing for you to live a
[14:52] life that this
[14:54] child would have an
[14:56] opportunity to be able to see Jesus
[15:00] Christ that's the point of all of it the
[15:03] whole thing is the dedicating right but
[15:05] the dedicating of the people that are a
[15:08] witness to all of it that's right that
[15:10] now we're to live before this child to
[15:13] where the child could have an
[15:15] opportunity of seeing Jesus
[15:18] Christ that's all we try to do and
[15:20] that's what we try to bring them to the
[15:21] to the Lord
