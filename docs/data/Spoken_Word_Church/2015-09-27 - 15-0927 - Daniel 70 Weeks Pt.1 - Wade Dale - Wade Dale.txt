TRANSCRIPT
========================================
to have a document man knows that the fourth dimension is ready away it's everything your television signal your radio signal your cell phone signal the internet everything runs through that fourth dimension which is ready away hey listen though we have a lot of fun it's no different than radio that we had back when it's just it's capturing more of an image nobody understand why they brother Brown said this was the worst time to live because why do you know if I can take my phone out which game to cut her first I take this thing right here I can mash about four buttons and we can watch a pornographic movie right here so where is it is it way out yonder no it's running right there there that's why them demons brother robin said travel affords me that's why you should now television that television is a portal internet to say is a portal to that fourth dimension the bottle says handle has expanded their get its gates one if you go back to that thing and i'll try to find it and i'll bring it remember when HD came out high-definition you analog analog filled up they have filled that fourth dimension so full they had to have more technology so now is high definition because it used to be analog everything without a lot for years it would all hell up and it showed the radio waves every and you know what the government hasn't allotted set up ready away you can't get on their signal they have a certain radio frequency that you can't get them all right well the devil's got a certain radio breathe until the fourth dimension when I told them I said would they come out with HD now they had analog he's filled up now that go HD HD snap from huge devil we used to watch a little television about that big look at the things that got now you go down the road and you look and you see these TV screens are as big as this room up on the Billboard you know yeah well man has broke into that fourth dimension so much we got let me get through the dimension hope the question that fourth dimension is radio wave something you can't see there's body's going through here right now that's words going through the lookup think of all the vulgar cell phone conversations that's going through this room you say how can you pick it up just pick your cell phone out if you can dial into who balloons that they were going to do you can listen to it right there so the fourth dimension is already a way to something you can't see the fifth dimension is where the center dead go if you guys Center you go into the fifth dimension that's why I said you know you say well they're in Hell burning right now there's no such thing as that they're not at Hell burning right now they're sitting somewhere in a dimension their soul is in a dimension somewhere they're not in the grave they're in a dimension a place of holding which is the fifth dimension which is the dead people when they die and they haven't give their heart to God and they haven't become a Christian they go in the fifth dimension and that's where they are held until what until the white throne judgment they you know they don't come up anymore see now the sixth dimension okay the sixth dimension is the bride the sixth dimension is all Christians Paul is in the sixth dimension them Peter James John brother Brown all the ones that died from them too right now brother Gary Gary Atkins is now when heat when he passed away his soul just went right over in that sixth dimension and he's more perfect now than he was here okay that's why Christians don't die hopefully their body sleeps but then he's not sleeping he's over there rejoicing while we're still worrying about bills and I go to work tomorrow cares why see how creasing is supposed to rejoice when the Christian passes away he's broken this veil of one two and three dimension and he's broke over into the sixth dimension where it's all eternity now you say one more dimension number seven there's only one man in that dimension right now I said right now and that's the Lord Jesus Christ okay why brother round I mean the Bible says no man has reached a mortality at seven Jesus Christ now immortality means that you were mortal okay you were moral this is mortal you have died come back and picked up this mortal body and become immortal that's why my brother drowned I don't know if you know it or not but the property God when God let him go into that sixth dimension he actually didn't go into the fifth dimension remember and saw hell he went over into joy sobbing women with mascara and cut hair and all that stuff then he went over into the sixth dimension and saw the saints that had passed on right and then he said well where's the Lord Jesus I want to see him what it what did the angel telling them he's higher in other words he's in another dimension number seven so what's that what what's going to happen in the resurrection is Jesus is going to come Jesus Christ that has a now a immortal body that he lived in on earth now it's immoral there's no I like that six dimension they don't have their flesh over there right they're not eating they're not drinking anything they're sitting and waiting and I'll promise you they're not bored they're not bored okay but you know what though brother Brown said they were what waiting because they're not complete a man they're perfect now listen that's that spirit that we talked about before they're in a spirit realm sure they have a body that looks like a flesh body but he has no flesh like this the flesh they were born in all right Jesus is in the flesh he was born in so to get back in the flesh he was born in we're going to have to get Jesus is going to come and pick up that sixth dimension all the saints can bring a run back here to this earth connect with their body you're not going to see graves bust it open that's an old wives tale cuz i heard i thought it was a secret catching away now what if you walked out in the tenth big old cemetery and you see these graves popped open you know something has happened but what a great thing that that's sold in that six dimension which went to a wall we have clever Gary out the door the other day you don't mind if I you the right I didn't think you would but brother yeah you didn't have to let him out the door for a soul to leave no it just whipped over in a faster dimension just stepped right over and he's more real now than he was then we got to start realizing that more real now than he was then because this is what this is not real this is vanity vanity of vanities Jesus is going to come from the seventh dimension pick up all those in the sixth dimension they're going to step right back into this dimension pick up their bodies you can say well they got to go down again whatever it don't matter to me you're just not going to see an empty you're not gonna see a gray popped open that body is going to come out of hand he just didn't have a problem walking through all over with his glorified body d but what a mystery though when the Bible puts a little thing in there and Jesus said give me some fish he went hungry he was just trying to show the disciples that he was in a human body again he said give me some visibly eat it well it didn't hit the floor when he ate it it went somewhere because when he went back out that wall I don't I don't wanna start preaching when he went through that wall he took that winning right so there's something he was in a glorified condition so there's your glorified body coming back to this dimension then what are we going to do we're going to go what back into another dimension whatever one aisle six dimension if you want to herself does that mean it was for me doesn't mean ever because we're gonna have a marriage supper while all this is being blowed up down here right but the people it's going to be killed down here after the Millennium even the foolish spurgeon are going in a dimension and they're going to be held there for a thousand years because they didn't give their heart that God didn't Oh God didn't owned their soul alright so if you don't own something that's not the earth you can't come and get something that's not yours alright but they're going to live they're going to stay in that dimension for a thousand years and then they're going to have to be resurrected and give an account for what they did on the earth that's when the Bible says you'll be judged by your works and I don't ever want to be judged by my work a Christian is never judged by his work we're already just the Bible said a man we're already judged we don't have to be judged again that's why we don't that's why that you know most of your denominations and all say that we have to be judged we don't have to go to the washroom Jetta the Bible says there's one sitting on the throne and thousands upon thousands upon thousands ministered with them what the bride's going to be sitting in judgment with God so I hope that to help you out so you got seven dimensions so we're going to tame this dome we're going let's read this real quick and Jeremiah 25 and this will kind of set a basis but I want you to let's just start with verse 10 that will I want to read it all but let's not look look at verse 6 now watch Jeremiah he's telling the people I'm sorry let's go back to two we got it we got to cover this verse to the wish Jeremiah the Prophet spending to all the people of Judah now who are they juzt okay Jews and to all the inhabitants of Jerusalem saying from the 13th year Joe Simon son of a lion king of Judah even to this day that is the three and twentieth year one third year the word of the Lord have come into me and I've spoken to you rising early and speaking but you have not hearken the Lord has sent until you all his servants the prophets rising early and sending them but you have not hearken or incline your ear to hear they said turn you again now everyone from his evil way and from the evil of you're doing and dwell in the land of Thor have given unto you to your father for ever and ever and going on after other gods to serve them and to worship them and provoke me not to anger with the works of your hands and I will do you know her God's telling them you do what I tell you to do her right therefore thus says the Lord of hosts because you have not heard my words okay you have not heard my words behold I will send and take all of the families of the North said the Lord and Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babel in my servant and will bring them against this land against inhabitants thereof it against all these nations round about and will utterly destroy them make them an astonishment and hissing in a perpetual desolation moreover I will take from them the voice of mirth and the voice of gladness the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the ride so now I'm going to be bride anymore and they're not going here from Gregory the sound of the mill strong and the light of the candle and this whole land shall be a desolation an astonishment and these nations shall serve the king of babbling 70 years there's you promise all right and it shall come to pass when 70 years or accomplished now that this is the natural time when 70 years are accomplished that I will punish the king of battling we'll get into that and that nation said Lord for their iniquity of the land of the child we'll make it perpetual desolations that's the natural happening of Israel and I will bring up on that land all not work which I pronounced against it even all that is written in this book Kris Jenner might have promised I'd against all nations pretty serious business in it okay but we're going to read that a little bit later on now let's turn to 28 and what happens is Jeremiah comes up and let me just give you a commentary real quick then we'll start on that next week but Jeremiah puts a yo cuz remember prophets sometimes use you how brother Brown took them you know you threw a stone up in the in the skies that does that the Lord you know the judgmental strike the west coast national in the 1964 alaska earthquake like the song alaska right sometimes profits have to do things you watching them in the bible they do they do something for a sign before God brings judgment well what what Jeremiah did and we had timely go back read it but what he does he puts a yoke around his neck and says it is Roble Bo with the bondage that we just talked about here all right just to make a long story short but now what happens is there's a man comes up in chapter 28 named pen and I Hananiah is also a profit all right having out as a prophet now what does Hananiah did Hannah 9 in other words let's go to let's see verse says the jest of the whole thing is is Jeremiah they're standing together in a room and Jeremiah's got yoga around his neck had an eye comes in and says no no I don't think that's that the Lord said told me it was only going to be two years before we get that 168 plus to make 70 they will way back before the 70 years started okay if I got that same app until they're standing in Jeremiah's prophecy on the future event he puts the yoke around his neck says Israel will be yoke for 70 years nevertheless here thou now this word that I speak about ears and in the ears of all the people the prophets that have been before me and before the up d before me Jeremiah and the pennine of old prophesied both against many countries against great Kingdom the war of evil and pestilence the profits with prophesize of peace when the word the prophet shall come to pass then show the Prophet be known that the Lord has truly set him that's the challenge it might be spoken in soft words but that's a challenge Jeremiah saying you and me one of us is right and the other one is wrong and God's one this gold shall left and then shall the Prophet be known what to the people that the Lord have truly sent him to what happens you got to profits down here a true intent of false hope all right this is where the preacher have got mad out you got mad at me for bringing this out I said well if you don't get down in 70 weeks right the Bible says you gonna die okay because Hannah and I did he got two ends in two weeks wrong Daniel staying 70 years captivity we're going to be in battling for 70 years with a yoke he's yoked itself then handing out of the Prophet took do from off the Prophet Jeremiah neck and drove the thing down broke it and say let's live watch this now and had a nice baking the presence of all the people saying thus saith the war hmm even so will I break the yoke of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon from the neck of all nations within space of two four-year not 72 and I didn't have a revelation he got caught up in his own self and it probably Jeremiah went his way now Jeremiah didn't jump up them scream stomp like a baby Jeremih just went on then the word Lord came unto Jeremiah the Prophet after they had a night of the Prophet had broken the yoke from off the name of the Prophet Jeremiah saying i'm going to tell hannah and i said thus says the Lord balance broken the yoke of wood but thou shalt make for them yokes of iron in other words him breaking the yoke did one thing for sure it made it rougher on Israel than it would have before right but that's that the Lord of hosts the God of Israel I have put a yoke of iron upon the neck of all these nations that they may serve in the upcoming every Kingdom battling they shall serve him and I have given him the beasts of the field also then said the Prophet Jeremiah had another prophet here now heading out of the Lord have not sent dick he's pissing get pretty Stern here but they'll make us this people to trust in a lot therefore thus saith the Lord behold I will cast thee from off the face of the earth down it's not saying that he stand to hell he's just not gonna live talking the way he's talking therefore this theft or build on Cassidy from off the face of the earth this year thou shalt done because thou has taught rebellion against the Lord so how now the Prophet died the same here in the seventh month okay that's right now we're reading just a little bit in 29 verse 8 the bottle says with us that the Lord of hosts the God of Israel let not your profits and your diviners that be in the midst of you deceive you neither hearken to your dreams would you cause to be dream but they promised I'm falsely unto you in my name I have not sent them stay aboard sent the order this Jeremiah dust at the horn that after 70 years be accomplished at Babylon I will visit you that's what God is telling them and perform the good word towards you and causing you to return to this place and I underlined this real thing because where were they they were intruding so they're gonna bring run back to the roof right let's go read that chapter 28 and 29 again I rush through it but we'll study on global
