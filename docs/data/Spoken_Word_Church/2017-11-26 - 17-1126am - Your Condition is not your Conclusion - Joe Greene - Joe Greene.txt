Word of God I like for you to take your Bibles and open with me to the book of 2nd Kings this morning chapter 20 and you just pray for us that the Lord will help us to his brother Theo Erasmus used to say getting the butterflies flying in order this morning amen before we breed this morning we'll just spill more than a word of Prayer Heavenly Father truly this morning Lord we counted a great privilege and a great honor to stand before the purchased of the blood of Jesus Christ or do you thought that we were more precious than your blood because you spilled your blood that we might be redeemed that we might be saved out of a lost estate of sin and God this morning we come before you with humbleness of heart Thanksgiving in our soul this morning Lord Jesus for all the many blessings that you bestowed upon us God we thank you for health and happiness we thank you Lord for the revelation of the word in this hour that's let us see Lord not only who we are but what we are and God

blessings in a supernatural way have you will away now Lord as we commit herself to you in the precious name of Jesus Christ we humbly pray amen let me just say lest I forget we certainly appreciate brother Sam opening the pulpit and allowing us to come this morning and we're we're just so honored to count you all as our friends this morning not just friends but family because we're all bought by the blood of Jesus Christ this morning birthed into the family of God and you know I was born into the family of greens some 56 years ago didn't have to join it but I was born into the family with all the rights and privileges of being called a green a man but greater than that I was born about 40 some years ago into the family of God with all the rights and privileges this morning and all the blessings that he has bestowed as we look together this morning second Kings chapter 20 begin reading in verse number one a very very familiar story to us no doubt this morning in those days was Hezekiah sick unto death and the prophet Isaiah the son of Amoz came to him and said unto Him thus saith the Lord set bone house in order for the I shall die and not live then he turned his face to the wall and prayed unto the Lord saying I beseech thee O Lord remember now how I have walked before the in truth and with a perfect heart and have done that which is good in thy sight and Hezekiah wept sore and it came to pass a for Isaiah was gone out into the midst middle court that the word of the Lord came to him saying turn again and tell Hezekiah the captain of my people thus saith the Lord the God of David thy father I have heard thy prayer I have seen thy tears behold I will heal thee on the hill V on the third day thou shalt go up unto the house of the Lord and I will add unto thy days 15 years and I will deliver thee in this city out of the hand of the king of Assyria and I will defend the city for my own sake and for my servant David's sake and I say I said take a lump of figs and they took and laid it on the ball and he recovered and Hezekiah said unto Isaiah what shall be the sign that the Lord will heal me and that I shall go up into the house of the Lord the third day and Isaiah said this sign shalt thou have of the Lord that the Lord will do the thing that he had spoken shall the shadow go forward 10 degrees or go back 10 degrees and Hezekiah answered it is a light thing for the shadow to go down 10 degrees nay but let the shadow return backward 10 degrees and Isaiah the prophet cried unto the Lord and he brought the shadow 10 degrees backward by which it had gone down in the dial of Ahaz may the Lord had his blessings to the reading of the word is you have your seats this morning like to speak for just a little while and kind of an evangelistic message this morning if you will your condition is not your conclusion how we want to take a few minutes this morning by the help of the Lord and deal with some conditions and all of us have conditions all of us have sickness all of us have circumstances we have problems in life and you know if you're here and you don't have problems of life please stand up and tell me your secret a man because you know we're all born in sin shaping iniquity we all have problems we all have circumstances we all have things that we have to deal with and you know as long as we live here on this earth we're gonna have problems amen but I'm so glad that there as we said at the beginning you know when we have a problem that lets us know that there is a solution because as we said God has already provided you know that the scripture tells us with every temptation he has already made a way of escape so we know that God is by our side and he has provided what we have need of sometimes we just need a little encouragement to build our faith as it were to reach out and take hold of what God is already provided for us this morning amen and I heard the coming already about faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the Word of God and we look back and we we see whenever Moses got ready and got to the point to where they were fixing to come out of Egypt with the children of Israel and whenever he began to rehearse to them by the Sam and tell them all the miracles and all the signs and all the things that God had showed them and and bestowed upon them and the reason he did that was to build their faith and to encourage them and to strengthen them to believe God that God was going to bring them to the land that he promised them amen and confirm his word that he had given to Abraham and if we look in this day we find that the prophet of God has done the same thing amen he rehearsed all the miracles he rehearsed all the signs he rehearsed all the wonderful things that God did amen and and he told us if thou canst believe all things are possible and I believe this morning that God has not changed he's Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever amen and if God did that for Moses he and he did it again and this day I believe that this morning as ministers of the gospel we are to rehearse those things and to help our faith be increased this morning amen now every one of us the scripture says has been dealt the measure of faith it's and what is that measure it's just enough for you to receive what you have need of amen now my dad used to talk about practicing your faith or putting it in action you know sometimes a lot of people say well how do I do that how do I make you work well you put God to the test amen how do I do that brother Joe just begin to believe and believe and believe and believe and wait until God gives the answer this morning amen so many times we want our pie and we want it now we don't want to wait a while amen but God sometimes he says just wait a little bit amen because he sees the big picture this morning we're looking right here at the circumstances at the situation but God is looking at the big picture and he knows that sometimes if we get certain things or we do certain things and he allows us certain events to happen in their lives it might not prove to be exactly the timing that we need that or our would be beneficial to us then as it would be down the road so God is is mindful of all of these things this morning amen now we need to understand as Christians this morning that whatever condition that we may have God already has a remedy for that and I know I'm I'm kind of repeating that this morning but we got to understand Amen it's not what you have but what he can deliver you from this morning amen we in this age and all the teaching and all the denominationalism it's put a limit on what God can do Amen because it's taught to people well miracles don't happen anymore that was for the Apostles that was for them that was for those back under but I want to tell you the Bible tells us Jesus price is the same yesterday today and forever he has not changed this morning if he has healed somebody before he will do it again amen the Prophet told us if you meet the same conditions and come with the same faith this morning God is obligated not to you but to this word this morning to accomplish and to bring to pass what you have need of to bring the healing to your body because why he's already done it amen and if we come under the same faith this morning under the same circumstances God will do it again amen so we got to realize it's not our condition that we're in but it's what God can do for us this morning and when we comprehend that and recognize that then we can begin to see the things that God would do for us and begin to be recipients of what he has in store now brother Branham tells us in the ten virgins in 144,000 Hughes he said now that that's a type of the gospel trumpet he said you might have served the devil all these years in Chains with drinking smoking gambling and sin dirty things no matter what you've done but when you hear the gospel trumpet sound it's a sign that you can go free you can go faith cometh by hearing a man hearing of the word of God now you've heard the FEU gospel you don't have to stay bound any longer now we look back in the Old Testament whenever amen the day of Jubilee the year of Jubilee and whenever those those people had been in bondage they had been enslaved maybe they they gotten a financial bind they had to endure themselves or to enslave himself as it were to a a wealthy individual to make it through and to to survive a man but whenever that year of Jubilee came there was a trumpet that sounded a man and whenever that trumpet sounded it didn't matter whether they were in the garden ho and whether they were plowing the field whether they were feeding the ox or or watering the the animals or whatever they were doing if they were in the house serving and cooking a meal when that trumpet sounded and they heard the voice of that trumpet as it were amen freedom was theirs this morning amen and it's the same thing with the gospel trumpet this morning when you hear the word of God and it quickens to your heart I have heard the voice of God he met the trumpet of God the word going forth and that word declares to me that I am free I am healed I am delivered I'm set free amen whatever you have need of this morning when you hear that word and it quickens to your heart it's the same as that Israelite here in that trumpet sound and it declare damn you are free this morning and you can lay down your whole you can lay down your dishrag you can lay down whatever amen has bound you or whatever you've been doing lay it aside because now there is a freedom that God has given you this morning and we've just got to walk in that freedom Amen my brother madam tells us in questions and answers he said you may think you're tied to brother sister that wrote this question you may think the devil has got you tied down there but he's lying amen there was one time a man came to Jesus Christ the Son of God he untied you don't you believe it you don't have to stay down there no sir you're free that's right he died in your place to take away your sins you just believed him flop your wings and fly away with the rest of them don't stay in that pit of the devil no sir we all we all look at life and wonder how did we end up here and what can we do to get out of this and into our destiny today we're going to move you from your condition to your god-given conclusion amen and I like that this morning because that lets me know Amen that whatever I'm faced with in life there is a conclusion to that and my condition just like Hezekiah Amen Hezekiah was a man just like you and I a man but he got a word from the Lord set your house in order Amen you're going to die in léo a member Hezekiah amen he had a reality of something this morning that he could touch the heart of God he turned his race to the wall and he began to pray and call out to God and say Lord my I've got things to do I want to finish this project I want to build this or whatever the case was and God heard his cry and before the prophet got out the door hardly Amen out to the middle court God spoke to me and said go back and tell him Amen that the condition is not the conclusion Amen I've heard his cry and I want you to know this morning God will hear your cry if you'll just call out to him Amen turn your face to the wall as it were and say Lord I need you to move in my situation I need you amen to change this circumstance because I don't know what to do amen so many times we get in problems and circumstances we don't know the answer but I know one who does this morning and that's the Lord Jesus Christ amen now we've got to realize this more than to have a victory there has to be a struggle amen the winner of a war can't win unless he fights a battle amen unless there is a skirmish or a fight there cannot be a victor this morning amen so we got to realize until you you can't be healed until you're sick I know my father-in-law some years ago maybe 30-some years ago now a man he was diagnosed with with cancer and and you know whenever the doctors came in and told him that morning said mr. myko said you've got cancer and you know it's it's in this condition and so forth and brother Rex said well praise the Lord how do you know God can heal it if you never have it amen and I want to tell you he lived for nearly 30 more years after that amen and God gave him strength listen he went to the doctor he took their radiation he went through their tests a man he never lost his hair he never lost his teeth only they told him that he might lose them but so he had them pulled he never lost his beard man and and you know just had a wonderful beautiful head of hair and I can say that this morning amen but you know God took care of him this morning how do you know God can heal it if you never have it and you can't get healed until you go through the sickness this morning but I'm so glad Amen that God has already said by whose stripes you are healed by whose stripes you were healed it's already done this morning it's just our faith has to walk out and take hold of what God has already said and already declared for you and on a man we got to realize this morning where we're at and we got to know our status and understand who we are amen I believe brother Branham said when this bride recognized this what she is this world will not be able to hold her she'll go in a rapture and that's what we're striving for this morning Amen I don't know about you but I'm longing to get out of this world I'm looking forward to the day that I'll have a change Amen that something will sweep over me and I won't be Amen bald and yeah and you know and and and overweight I'll be a man a perfect specimen of what God has declared that we would be this morning Amen now you look up here and say well brother Joe I just don't know about that well amen let me tell you this morning I believe what the Bible said I believe what the prophets said this morning a man he said will turn back to the 18 to 21 year old somewhere in that range Amen just like Abraham did listen when you see Abraham and you hear the story how that God had come on the scene that promised him a child and so forth and then after 25 years later here Abraham was running around described it was walking along with his king Amen stoop-shouldered and just trying to get around the best he could and then all of a sudden after that visitation of Melchizedek amen and if he had the bread and wine with Abraham a man and Sarah's secrets were discovered and the and Melchizedek said why did Sarah laugh and you know the story this morning amen and then after that something began to happen to brother Abraham and sister Sarah now abraham believed a promise all those years and he staggered not Amen but sister Sarah had to get her own revelation this morning and when she did things begin to happen and it wasn't just a little while until they wrapped the baby in their arm a man oh let me tell you this morning when we get our personal revelation of what the Word of God has said it won't be long until we receive the benefit of that this morning and we hold the promise in our arms or in our body or in our situation this morning because God has declared that it would be today amen why little Bethlehem brother Benham said and another great event that I wouldn't forget to call that was when David was in his worst of time when it was a fugitive he'd already been anointed he knowed what he was to be he was to be king God said so and yet he was hated he was standing in between two great deep fires here was the Philistines on one side after him here was Saul on the other side and he was a man without a nation just as the church stands today the true living Church of God without a denomination or anything else she stands alone but yet she she's had the anointing poured on her she knows what she is now we know it intellectually we know our brother say I'm up here in their mind but what it's got to happen is has got to drop from here about 12 inches down in our heart this morning amen and recognize and realize that as a man thinketh in his heart so is he it's not what we know intellectually it's not what we can conjure up in our mind a member when it drops down as a revelation from God to you just like Peter whom do men say that I the Son of man am jesus said and some said you're lying you Jeremiah this one that one the other amen but Jesus said but whom say ye that I am and Peter with a divine revelation of God he said thou art the Christ the Son of the Living God and Jesus said flesh and blood didn't reveal it to you but my father which is in heaven and it became so real to Peter Amen that he realized this was more than just a man and I want you to understand Amen you are more than just the people you are sons and daughters of God you are deity in flesh this morning walking around little Messiah it's according to the word of the Prophet hey man we are God upon the earth this morning hey man and when we comprehend that Amen not up here but down here and when it becomes so real to us and then what's going to happen amen we are going to become amen the fullness of the manifestation of God in this hour amen you forgive me this morning we got to understand our condition we need to first understand that God has already declared my end from my beginning Isaiah 41 26 who had declared from the beginning that we may know and before time that we may say he is righteous yay there is none that shows you a there is none that declare with you a there is none that heareth your words but it is God that hath declared not men a man you know denominations they want to go and they want to make some men elevate them and you even you know in the Catholic Church they want to elevate men to certain positions and make them a man as God upon the earth and and they've got you know they've got a bit of truth there but it's perverted a man by the sound they they they try to to make it a man-made or a man lid situation which we realize they man as as my dad used to say God started his church like he wants it and now he wants it like he started it how did he start the church on the day of Pentecost he poured out his spirit in those believers amen and that's how God started his church and that's what God wants to see today a church that is full of the Holy Ghost and fire a church that can be led by the Spirit of God not some hierarchy out of Rome or Chattanooga or wherever it might be Cleveland Tennessee amen God wants a church that's led by the power of God and by the Holy Ghost this morning because God Amen is he is the leader he is the God this morning he is our instructor and that's how he wants his church to lead in this hour that we're living in isaiah 40:8 and 3 i've declared the former things from the beginning and they went out of forth out of my mouth and I showed them I did them suddenly and they came to pass now knowing this morning that he has declared our beginning it helps me to understand what is said in Jeremiah 29:11 said for I know the thoughts I think towards you said the Lord thoughts of peace and not of evil and to give you and expect it in do you realize God knew this morning exactly how you would end up look back at the children of Israel and we refer to them a number of times this morning but the children of Israel brother Louise when they came out of Egypt do you reckon God knew that they were going to murmur and complain and backslide God knew that he knew that they were going to grumble and carry on and and murmur against God against Moses and against Aaron he knew a man that they were not going to go into the Promised Land God knew that cause he's an all-knowing God this morning a man he knows the end from the beginning a man but yet knowing that what did God do did God cast him away no did God destroy them he did naturallyspeaking Hey but there was a seed amongst that group this morning that God preserved amen there was those that God knew amen that they would hold fast to the Word of God and I believe in this our God knows there is a people a man that will stand by the Word of God they will not deny they will not fall away amen they will not back up from saying well I'm not sure if he's a prophet anymore I'm not sure about this and about that there is a people that has declared from their heart this morning they meant by divine revelation and they understand a man that God takes a man a man and uses that man that man is not perfect a man that man has mistakes just like Abraham just like Noah just like Jacob just like all the men that God used well I hope this is all right this morning a man that God takes a man an imperfect man and he covers him by the anointing of the Holy Ghost this morning amen and whenever that anointing speaks through that man it's not the man not the imperfect man that's speaking but it's a perfect God that speaks through that man this morning Amen so we've got to find a man a balance and realize he's just a man but God uses the instrumentality of man amen he takes our imperfections a man that he brings through us the perfection of God this morning amen the declaration that God has made of us it gives us peace to know that our condition is not the conclusion amen the things we're facing now it's not the outcome that God has expected for us this morning amen it's just the beginning of the situation to get me to the where the conclusion is amen now understand that God has a plan for your life this morning and in that plan he wants you to know that the condition is your release to your conclusion Amen as we said earlier you can't get healing until you've been sick you can't have victory until you have a war or a battle you can't have deliverance until you've been bound this morning amen all of these conditions are just the forerunners of the conclusion that God has for you and listen this morning what does God allow these things for he allows them to mold character in you they meant to shape you and form you into what he has expected for EURion this morning and he knows amen what what good is if we take our children this morning and we give them everything they won't they we let them do anything they want to do that has that hasn't in but it's not the end that you want this morning a man but I think we want to train them in the way that's right and let them see and understand there is a right road to follow and if you follow the wrong road Amen it's going to be trouble and destruction in the end this morning and that's what God is doing for you and I as his sons and daughters he's leading us and listen just like little children or young children or adult children sometimes they make the wrong choices well maybe them Georgia you don't have that problem maybe that's just in North Carolina amen sometimes sometimes we as adults make the wrong choice but I'm so glad this morning a man that when we get ourselves in those conditions and sometimes when those conditions come upon us at no fault of our own or no direction of our own that does not mean we have to stay there that does not mean that that's how it's going to turn out this morning it just lets me know a man that God is mindful and that God has something in store down Road for you and I this morning it will just put our confidence in him and recognize a man that he hasn't expected in for you and I and as we started to say we make our mistakes we make our faults and their failures amen and God is aware of that he's mindful of that this morning and he knows a man he knows what we're going to do you know I can't help when I think of these things a little cap I used to have a little ball cap and on that cap it had a little boy with a slingshot in his back pocket he had a cat by the tail and the slogan on there said God knows all about me but he loves me anyway I'm so glad sister Becky that he does this morning Amen because he knew my ends from to my beginning and listen he knew the road I would travel he knew the wrong I would do he knew the right I would do and he knew the choice I would make a man when he come down and life was presented to me and salvation was presented to me he knew I would choose that he knew in the end I would do the right thing hey man and I'm so glad this morning that when he saw and he looked brother Joe at me and he saw he meant what I was and what I would turn out to be without His grace amen he didn't leave me there amen there was another conclusion that he had for me this morning and I'm so thankful for that in this hour now understand that the condition does not kill you well brothers Joe I know this one had this condition and and and they died from it and they had that condition they didn't survive it or whatever the case might be but I want you to understand even though you go through a condition you go through a sickness if your heart is right if your heart is right brother Danny and everything is all right between you and the Lord and this body passes away what's more important this flesh that's gonna rot in the ground or that man on the inside amen we think about the rich young ruler he came to Jesus what must I do to to be saved or to inherit eternal life jesus said amen keep the commandments he said I've done all there hey man that's wonderful amen we all do that we try to hey man but jesus said you like one thing go sell all that you have and give to the poor a man his heart wasn't a ride he meant and brother madam told us later that inhale he lift up his eyes amen and they saw that great go fix the neighbor Hammond on the other side and and he wanted some relief from the condition that he was here he passed up the relief that a condition that he was in he turned it down and wouldn't accept it and because of that brother Sam amen he had a different conclusion but I'm so glad this morning when we don't turn down the medicine if you will the salvation then our conclusion Amen it's not the condition that we're in when it's all said and done and we look in Isaiah chapter 54 and we realize that it releases hope in knowing that God did not make a mistake in choosing you to deal with this situation going back to my father-in-law how do you know God can heal it if you never have it God knew brother X would have that kind of faith and listen as we said brother X lived oh by the way I forgot to tell you when he was taking those radiation treatments he was working in a sawmill and I know you country brothers down here know a little bit about how hard work that is it's not easy but he never missed a day's work he'd Drive about 25 miles down the ray to take his treatment he had turned right around come back and go right back to work amen God blessed him God honored his faith amen and he as I said he never lost his Harry he never lost his strength until years later hey man when when it flared up again amen I and they never did find the original or the main trunk or the main source amen but you know God kept him all those years amen now isaiah 54:17 as we refer to no weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper and every tongue that shall rise against the in judgment thou shalt condemn this is the heritage of the servants of the Lord and their righteousness is of me saith the Lord I want you to realize there whatever weapon the devil forms against you it will not prosper Amen how can you say that mojo because I know what he's already said he has an expected end for me Amen he knows what its gonna be in the end he knows that that that my life is not going to be destroyed by the devil he knows that he's going to bring me through he knows he's going to heal me he knows he's gonna bring deliverance in my life amen and no weapon that the devil forms against you whether it be cancer whether it be lies whether it be deceit Amen whether it be circumstances whether it be a lost children that you know and the devil uses that worse than anything I believe against us parents when we see our children and we see them going the way of the world and nothing tears it our heart more than our children well maybe you're not as concerned a parent as I am I thank God for what God's done for Nathaniel he's serving the Lord and now I'm beginning to speak a little bit so I thank God for that but you know I deal with people and you know whenever they come and their hearts disscourn because their children is doing this and the children is doing that and the children is doing the other thing amen and it just breaks their heart it just pulls at their heartstrings and and you know just just they just don't know what to do or have a handle it well the thing to do a man is we dedicate our children to the Lord when they're little bitty babies and we don't baptize them we just dedicate them to God and when they come of age and recognize they need a Savior then they repent then they're baptized then God fills them with the Holy Ghost amen but what we do we give them to God and say Lord they're in your hands amen you have promised me you shall be saved and your house man now how God does it that's not my business when God does it that's not my business but my business is to take what he said you shall be saved in your house this morning Amen well brother Joe they have to be saved they have to be born again absolutely hey man but I want to tell you this morning God has it in control amen how he does it that's not for me to worry about my worry is to believe what he said this morning and to claim that promise of God amen and understand today Amen that he is a big enough God to take care of his word this morning amen now this condition is a weapon that the devil forms against you amen but the scripture says it cannot prosper amen what is the condition that the enemies formed against you this morning that you have to have to be back stepping into fear and oppression and that's what the devil wants this morning he wants to get you oppressed he wants to get you depressed he wants to get you in a spirit of fear well praise the Lord again maybe this is just for a North Carolina folks but you know maybe y'all just in do it this morning maybe somebody on the internet hear it hey Ben but he wants to get you bound by fear what's brother Ernie say false evidence appearing real amen it's not true evidence this morning you know a couple years ago I had to sit on the grand jury for the state of North Carolina for about a year's time and we'd have to sit there and they'd bring in their cases and well we've got this much evidence we got this and we got that and we as a jury have to decide is there enough evidence to bring it to trial amen well I want to tell you this morning friend if we believe the Word of God amen there is evidence against the devil and his tactics this morning amen there is evidence that will prove that he is a liar that he is a deceiver that he this morning a man is one that will try his best to intimidate you I know this is simple ABC this morning but it's what the Lord laid on my heart amen he tries to intimidate us to bring us to a position to where we are so bound by fear that it's hard for us this morning to take hold of the promises of God amen because listen we are human this morning a man that we go by what we can see taste feel smell in here and many times what does that do that hinders this morning faith in our hearts and causes us a mentor to look at the circumstances instead of the conclusion this morning oh my but if we could ever just grasp hold of that conclusion and realize God has promised us the victory this morning amen and he sold us in the book of Revelation to him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne even as I have overcome and set with my father in his throne now do you think he would have made that statement if there was a somebody going to overcome this morning Amen no he knew that you would be overcomers he knew that you would be victorious this morning he knew that because he knew the conclusion to your condition this morning brother Branham tells us in the message job he said oh sure you're giving him everything he wants got him all hedged up and everything said no wonder said sure he can serve you making plenty of money plant got plenty of cattle got everything in life said sure anybody can serve you like that said if you'll let me have him I'll make him curse you to your face and what did God say I don't believe it the devil comes before the Lord that says Lord you got Joe green down there and he's out there preaching faith and he's out there preaching that you have done made a way of escape and you've done you've done brought victory in his life and you've done helped him to overcome and and say if you'll just let me get at him if you'll just let me put sickness on him furious let me take his little houses and his little land and all the little things that he's got if you let me do that he'll curse you to your face and I trust that God sitting there on the throne and said now now he won't do it I've got confidence in John Green and you think well why am I going through this why not you every son that cometh to God must be chastened of the Lord amen well brother Joey's at chase think no not always sometimes it might be but not always sometimes God looks down and says there's brother Boyd you know brother Boyd has been testifying of how good I've been to him and how blessed he is you know I'm just gonna let him have a little hardship and just let's just see if he really means that well brother Joe do you think God's that kind of God absolutely absolutely Wow because he loves you and he's got confidence in you and he knows a man that you have an expected end and that expected in is not a end of defeat and gloom and despair but that expected him by the Lewis is a end of victory of joy of peace of happiness of our blessings of God and God knows that this morning Amen so what what do we do we look at the circumstances and we say oh god how am I going to get through this well how am I gonna get through it is he's gonna bring me through it this morning amen how romans 8:28 tells us and it's a very very familiar scripture this morning he says and we know that all things but then used to say all is all-inclusive without exception everyone I was preaching down to Mexico brother Dan was interpreting for me and I used that illustrates him and I said a three-letter word and brother Dan said uh-huh I said Oh a three-letter word he said uh-uh he said I can't interpret that as a three-letter word because in Spanish help me brother Louisa if I if Spanish all is nosotros is that right ok no ok it's more than three words three letters anyway hey man it's more than three letters I spent a long time ago a man but it's more than three letters he said I can't interpret it as being a three-letter word amen so you know but whatever how many letters it is all-inclusive without exception every one anything that you're dealing with amen it's working toward your good let's go back to the script here and we know how many knows this morning that all things work together for the good amen of them that loved the Lord a man to them that love God to them who are the called according to his purpose and we know his purpose is to have a spotless bride Oh mom that should have made a Baptist shout to have a spotless bride is his purpose amen and who is that this morning amen that's you and I and his purpose will be fulfilled and everything that I go through it's for a purpose this morning to bring me to that place where I can be a part of that spotless bride this one now understand that the Bible is declared to us that no matter what the condition is this morning it's working for my good why because I love the Lord and I am called according to his purpose amen now we realized this morning that these things are formed and they leave a condition but it's all worked out for my good this morning understand that we have to know that this condition is for the glory of the Lord amen Paul the Apostle said in second Winston's 12:9 he said unto me my grace is sufficient for thee now listen Paul was a man that was shipwrecked several times or a couple of times that beaten several times and lift for dead and and despised and rejected of of his peers and of the Church of that day amen but what did he do he said listen I know that these things are for my good they bring me to a place that where I put my confidence in God and his word amen and I know that these things are not going to move me no weapon formed against me shall prosper and God has promised me that I will be victorious this morning ow he's in in his confidence there he said in verse 9 he said unto me my grace is sufficient for thee my strength is made perfect in weakness they meant most gladly therefore will I glory in my infirmities that the power of Christ may rest upon me Paul knew that these infirmities in these hardships amen they was molding him they meant to a place to where the power of Christ could rest upon him and that Christ could be manifested through his life now as we move on we want to look and see how to approach God in the middle of your condition and approach to God a man is going to be important you know you see somebody going through a trial and you know they come up and they still God why God why did you let this happen and why is this going on in this situation a man and how you respond to the situation is how God responds to you Amen the condition of your prayer this one is going to open or closed doors Amen and listen we must get the first statement Amen in order to release or we don't forget the first statement I should say in order to release our faith to believe that our condition is the opening for our conclusion what we're going through lets me know that there's something better in the end amen second Timothy 3:16 and I'm trying to Terry this morning he said all Scripture is given by inspiration of God and is profitable for doctrine for reproof for correction for instruction in righteousness that the man of God might be throughly a lot of people read that as thoroughly but it's throughly throughly furnished unto all good works amen the word coming forth you know lots of time we sit there and we say why in the world is the preacher preaching on such a subject is that why is he dealing with that situation why is he preaching about this they meant well Amen somebody needs to hear it this morning hey man if the man of God is in tune with the Lord a man that God puts things on his heart it's not just that to back the air this morning Amen God uses them instrumentality of men amen he takes the fivefold ministry and he comes along and it deals with situations in our heart this morning in our lives amen and if we listen to the Word of God God always provides the answer this morning amen that we might be throughly furnished made perfect furnished unto all good works now according to the prior that Hezekiah prays in second Kings 20 that we read he appeals to God as the son has not finished his labors amen and and he bends on the grace of his father to grant him amen the time that he needs to complete his project a mentor whatever he's doing there and we got to take note that Hezekiah did not allow his condition of impending death I mean thus saith the Lord you're gonna die he didn't let that faze him he turned his face to the wall and he said God I need a little more time can I just share a personal testimony with you this morning I am one son out of seven children and my dad always wanted to see myself and sister Rex and have a child we were married 11 years thought we weren't going to be able to have children and prayer was made and prophecy was given and within just a little amount of time since the wreck Sam was expecting by the Sam and here is the result of that almost 28 years ago in just a few days amen but you know whenever we we we got the promise and then during the time of the the pregnancy dad had his first heart attack and it was October the first Sunday evening never will forget as long as I live October the first that evening the aunts brothers and Louie were singing at the church and and dad and brother Dan had just come back from Costa Rica and dad had some sickness and so forth and as you can understand from drinking the water and different things and and so forth so he come in he was in the the on the platform while they were singing they come back in had to go to the restroom and and he's he come back by the sound booth there in the old church he said son come and come out here and pray for me I just feel terrible I just need a touch from the Lord so we did and then after the service of course he ended up going to the hospital with a heart attack but anyways Nathaniel was on the way he hadn't arrived yet and this was in October in US and he was born in December and you know when dad knew that that child was coming he never did say it's gonna be a girl he said when my grandson gets here you know he's gonna carry on the name and you know Israel he was real excited cuz you know we were the only Son and carrying on the name and so forth and then when he was born and then of course dad was so thrilled and so excited and you know just spend as much time with him as he could and and all those things and then you know two years less than two years I guess it was actually after Nathaniel was born dead passed away November the 22nd in Nathaniel was not hard at two years old but several weeks and months before that dad would just sometimes he'd be played with him he's I wish I could just talk to him and have a conversation with him and so forth and you know I believe that the condition that dad was in when he had that first heart attack if it hadn't been for the hand of God I believe dad would have went home at that time but I believe like Hezekiah my daddy turned his face to the wall now you might say well brother Joe I don't believe it well that's okay it didn't happen to you it happened to me amen I believe that dad knew that he death was imminent he knew that his time was short and just from conversations and all the things that happened he knew that God was gonna take him home amen and he turned his face to the wall as it were and he prayed he said Lord let me see that grandbaby amen let me see that child amen and God allowed him almost two years to enjoy that grandson amen and then God took him home amen now you might say well brother Joe that's that's foolish well I have a Bible example and God does not change this morning amen God is still the same Jehovah Jireh he is still a prayer answering God amen and and dad turned his face to the wall and he got to enjoy that grandbaby then God took him home amen and you know this morning amen have we in our faith in our condition can look to God amen and recognize that he is what he says he is and he will do what he says he will do Amen then our condition does not have to be our Cluj in this morning now as we look in James chapter 5 verse 16 the Bible declares the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much and we can see what happened in Hezekiah day we can see what happened in brother Henry Greene's day amen we can see what happened into profit of God's day a man and I trust we can see what's happening in our day this morning and recognizing that he is the same yesterday today and forever amen so when we have that understanding this morning a man that we condition ourselves to pray effectually amen and that word effectually means sufficient to provide a result a man sufficient to provide a result when we pray enough and when we pray with the right frame of mind but probably God said the right mental attitude toward any promise of God will bring it to pass this morning and when we come with that kind of an effectual prayer then God will honor this morning and hear our prayer and we've got to come with an expectation to believe that he will this morning amen it said that expectation is the breeding ground for miracles Hezekiah didn't pray just to hear himself pray amen he didn't pray just to say well God I'm praying and I I'm hoping Hezekiah expected God to hear his prayer amen he didn't not know when God would answer but he knew had to be before his death this morning amen because he asked God to let him live he didn't ask God to raise him from the dead he asked God to let him live you know some of the brothers sometimes they'll say what we need to do is pray specific you know we pray in general god bless the brothers in the church God bless the sisters in the church God bless the mission program god bless all the missionaries around the world but sometimes we need to say God you see brother Sam down there in Georgia Ulf out there in the country you know but he's going through a test lord I don't know what he's going through but Lord maybe he's going through something Lord just go down there on sagres Road and and help brother Sam and encourage him and strengthen them specifically for him this morning amen but you know so many times we want to generalize it but if we could ever just come to realize Amen that God wants us to pray specific this morning amen I'm thinking of a story but I can't think of it of how you know somebody prayed and you know that they asked for certain things I know what it was we were in the Philippines a couple years ago or a few trips back brother Dolan myself you know we were on the island of Palawan and it was hot and we thank God that they had some fans and a little breeze of blowing but we got a call or the brothers did from some brothers on another island which was about a five hour boat ride across the Pacific Ocean from one island to the other and those brothers said the waves are so high we want to come to the meeting but we can't get there because of the waves and their little boat that we have to travel in and it's just not safe said would you brothers pray that the wind will stop and the waves will settle them so we can come so we prayed and brother Danny we prayed Lord stop the wind and let the waves settle them so those brothers can come to the meeting and my goodness we prayed and God heard our prayer and just in a few hours here come those brothers and they made it across the sea and they had a tuna about this big here and about that big around God blessed them with that they could sell that and pay for the gas to make the trip in the boat but we'd like to roast it because we didn't pray God's settle down the ways but let the wind still blew over here now that might be silly but that actually happened amen and we'd like to have roasted not only did the winds die but the electricity went out and we didn't have no fans but hallelujah anyhow our brothers got to come and God bless them with a big fish amen and help them to pay the way to get there amen stopped the wind amen so what what happened amen their condition was not their conclusion a man in our condition wasn't our conclusion either but thank God it was a blessing to them and we saw the hand of God move this morning Oh let me tell you God is still real this morning he's still alive and well and we realized that Hezekiah wasn't the only one that had conditions if we check through the Bible amen in the log of the history of men Amen you'll find many others have suffered from conditions and circumstances and because they had an expectation their conclusion was great this morning amen what is expectation it's nothing more than having faith to believe God for a testimony amen the Bible declares in Revelation 12:11 they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb and by the word of their testimony amen so you know a lot of people say well how can I test if I've been healed if I'm still sick because you're not looking at the condition you're looking at the conclusion and the conclusion says by whose stripes you were healed amen overcoming conditions by the blood of the Lamb and Romans 4:17 and call it those things which be not as though they were amen and believe in God now in my conclusion this scene as we come to a conclusion here by saying that no matter what your condition might be it does not have to be and it is not your conclusion whether you're conditioned be drugs or alcohol and I know we're believers here this morning smoking their sex or lust or pain or abuse or or our oppression or depression or discourage some of whatever it is this morning that's your condition but it does not have to be your conclusion God says it's not your conclusion it's just a trick of the enemy to make you feel that you'll always be bound can you imagine brother Joseph way back down there in the dungeon in Egypt you know he talked to the butcher and the Baker and said when y'all are restored or when the one that's restored remember me don't forget about me but he forgot about him and here he was did you think he meant days went by that he didn't sit there and think oh god I'm gonna rot in this dungeon how many years did he spend there quite a few amen but that was not his conclusion because he had already had a vision or a night dream amen that saw his parents and his brothers bowing to him and and him in a position of authority God had showed him this dungeon is not your conclusion but all my the circumstances no doubt many times made him doubt and made him worry made him concern amen but the end God's time and in God's season what happened God brought him out of there and placed him to where his father and his brothers had to come to him and listen to that friend amen you got to realize that why do the people in the world call you and ask you to have your church to pray this morning because they know they have seen your testimony and heard your testimony of the results of your prayers and you're calling out to God and they know that you are able to touch God where they are not this morning we can't come and say well grandpa had it great granddaddy had it and granddad had it and daddy had it and I guess I'll have to deal with it to know somebody has to break the cycle somebody has to break the change and who is that going to be it's going to be me this morning a man I'm gonna say you don't matter if daddy had a they don't matter if granddaddy had a they don't matter if great-granddaddy Eddie and don't matter of great great great great great great game there they had it I am defined that thing this morning I'm telling it get behind me Satan I'm not gonna deal with that or I am gonna deal with it I'm gonna put it in this place and say it's not mine I don't claim it this morning I refuse to walk in that I refuse to live with that why because I know I am a son of God amen and I have been given the authority to put the devil in his place this morning remember what God said through them the Apostle Paul who said Corinthians 4:17 for our light affliction which is but for a moment worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory amen our our afflictions and our conditions amen it's it has a purpose as God is molding us and shaping us and bringing us this morning to a place to where we are totally completely submitted to him a man Moses had a condition he was a murderer Exodus 2:12 and you look this way and he looked that way and scripture said and and when he saw that there was no man he slew the Egyptian and he hid him in the sand and that was the condition and Moses had to flee for his life but that wasn't the end of the story God got him into a place to where he can wash all of that knowledge of Egypt out of him and all that Pharaoh ism' out of him and put in him a ability to speak to God and to hear from God and and that God could take that vessel and use it to bring about the deliverance for the children of Israel naman had a condition he was a leper but that wasn't his conclusion amen even though he balked and even though he said ain't there better rivers in in his country and then Syrian can I go there amen but sometimes we just got to listen to the Word of God and to be obedient to that if when we do then our condition changes tonight and their conclusion it's not what the condition was brother Branham says in the ten virgins 144,000 he said now that's the type of the gospel trumping you might have served the devil we read this in the beginning all these years and chains with drinking smoking gambling sin and dirty things no matter what you've done but when you hear the gospel trumpet sound it's a sign that you can go free you can go faith cometh by hearing hearing of the word of God now you've heard the full gospel you don't have to stay bound any longer thirsting for life so you see the same God with Florence Nightingale there is the same God that's right here he's the same one and the only thing you don't have to wait to be prayed for the only thing you have to do is just believe that the work is done if you're a sinner you don't have to wait for an altar call right where you're sitting while Peter yet straighten these words the Holy Ghost fell on them that heard the word they were ready it's a condition of the heart it's a condition of the people who listen this morning if there's someone here that has a condition there's someone here that has a circumstance I want to tell you that is a condition but it is not the conclusion that's not what God has in mind for you that's not what God wants you to be God wants you to be healed he wants you to be delivered he wants you to be free this morning he wants you to be happy and joyous he wants you to rejoice in the good things of God this morning you don't have to remain there and in order not to remain there you have to walk in faith and believe what God see it and you can have the results this morning stand with me if you will just remember you're not at the end you're just at the beginning of your conclusion right amen and when when when you when you walk in faith and look to God for that expected Ian that he has for you then God will honor your faith to signing to him that believe us what the scriptures say all things are possible amen maybe this morning is we bow our heads you're here and there's a condition that you're dealing with a circumstance a situation sickness whatever it is this morning God is able he sent his word the scripture said and the power of God was present to heal these are not things that brother Joe just made up these are things we've taken from the word from the message of the hour and we believe it's true this morning we believe it's accurate we believe it's right and we believe that God will keep his word if you've got a need this morning just lift your hand if you would God knows every circumstance Heavenly Father as we bow our heads before you this morning Lord we know that your word has declared that our condition is not our conclusion and Lord we we believe this morning that as the word has gone forth that the power of God has been present to heal just like the scripture we read their Lord less Peter was yet speaking unto them the Holy Ghost fell upon them and Lord we believe that as the words have been spoken this morning that your healing virtue can fall it's already been paid for Lord it's already been provided your deliverance your salvation your victory your joy it's already been provided this morning then we believe as the word has gone forth God it could fall and it has fallen and it's spoken two hearts and quicken to them they're free they're walking in deliverance this morning they're walking in victory because Lord is as the one of the earlier songs that was saying this morning victory in Jesus and we believe that this morning with all of our hearts that there is victory there's there's joy there's peace there's deliverance Lord in the name of Jesus Christ and we speak that name this morning Lord above over this congregation of people and Lord through that name may victory reign in every heart in every life touch ever sick one this morning Lord God we can lay hands upon them if they so desire but Lord that we know that God your word has been delivered and by faith and that word we can walk away with victory this morning we thank you for this morning bless your people Lord meet ever need God touch ever sick every condition every circumstance Lord and God let your children walk into that conclusion this morning we pray we thank you for father we believe it so in the precious name of the Lord Jesus Christ we humbly pray I heard an old old story how a savior came from glory how he gave His life on Calvary to save a wretch like me I heard about his groaning all his precious blood toning I repented all my sins and won the victory [Music] all victory and Jesus my Savior forever he sought me and he bought me with his redeeming blood he loved me and all my love is to him he wants me to victory do you believe in victory in Jesus is he a man he's promised it to us if he could just reach out and take hold of what his word has said a man maybe we could sing another chorus rather tell if you'll lead it and if you got need we we we believe that the laying on of hands they shall lay hands on the sick and they not lying maybe not hope to but they shall recover forever he saw me he bought me with his redeeming blood he loved me ere I knew him and all my love is to him he plunged me to victory beneath the cleansing flood I heard about [Music] how we made the lame to walk again and cause the blind to see and in the crud dear Jesus come here my broken spirit as somehow Jesus came and broke to me the victory all victory and Jesus my Savior forever he sought me and he bought me with his dream is love [Music] if I have a date y'all start from your confessions to victory and move on to murder their brother with yes built for me and I heard about what about it we've heard of the future home [Music] millennial reign days we used to wonder about how about the we've heard about see it's just right ahead and it's all in the conclusions we see we toss that gonna be a compulsory here the inclusion of the man who sees that finishes see step out on the Word of God and believe it geez so it's really me II love me [Music] he plunged me to victory Amen let's give our brother a good input I believe I believe it I want to know the conclusion beginning Garay but I like the conclusion I want to be there when it's all finished if I have to go by the grave that's fine I don't no problem but I'd like to finish this race I'd like to finish the race to see what its gonna be like God we spoke about it for a long time I just like to see it when you make sure you tell her brother how much you appreciate the message we believe it you'll be ministering this afternoon so just practice Lord and rest him up and everything to be fine you know and let everything be great amen so just pray to see the conclusion what we've heard should bring a great expectation into our hearts and life well we've been able in this day to see and to walk in but I want to see the conclusion I want to see the finish of it don't you father we thank you Lord our hearts is stirred to think about an expectation that we've seen and heard that we want to see the conclusion of the matter we want it all to be finished and we believe it'll be done in our day and we thank you Father so as we move on in you we were just holding on to you and your word that has given us the promise we believe the promise cuz there's one thing we know for sure your word is true there is our conclusion is what you say it and we believe you thank you Father in Jesus name you dismiss tell her brother how much you appreciate him Jesus is the lighthouse and from the rocks of sin for he has shown of my around me and I clearly see
