where that we passed them out uh you know their Wednesday and explaining some of those things and we will not uh spend a lot of time trying to explain it because we'd never get through with the

grace and kindness that you would extend unto us a people that are Unworthy of anything that could be thought of in your ideas or points but it was not on our worthiness it was on what you said because you come down to save us it wasn't us trying to save ourselves and Lord what we must do then is depend upon you and what you say so we ask you now that you would just bless each one that as we read your word that you will come on the scene and honor your word and bless those on internet that are listening live today and things father we don't want to forget them because they're part of the ministry also that if they're listening then they can hear about you we ask you that you would just have your way guide us now and keep us in your loving grace in Jesus name amen Psalms 118 I've been reading this now 15 services so we'll get through it one of these days open to me the gates of righteousness ver ver 19 I will go into them and I will praise the Lord this gate of the Lord unto which the righteous shall enter I will praise thee for thou Hast heard me and art become my salvation the stone which the builders refused is become The Headstone of the corner this is the Lord's doing it is marvelous in our eyes this is the day day which the Lord hath made we will rejoice and be glad in it save now I beseech thee Oh Lord oh Lord Lord I beseech thee send now Prosperity Blessed Be he that cometh in the name of the Lord now remember that's the scripture we've been reading because blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord it it would if someone is coming in the name of the Lord then that's the Lord coming right they may be sending another one in a servant or a for but that's fine but that's still his coming see we have blessed you out of the house of the Lord now let's go over to Zechariah I hope you've been reading these uh scriptures and uh you know meditating on them and I know I'm very slow in my preaching but and also repetitive but I it took me a year and a half to finish the first grade not because I couldn't hear and all like that but that is one good point you know I had to learn it over and over and over but uh once you learn it 1+ 1 is still two algebra geometry trigonometry whatever it is it's still got one bases what 1 + 1 equals two all right now we'll read in Zechariah and the angel that talked with me came again and wait me as a man that is wakened out of his sleep and he said unto me what seest thou and I said I have looked and behold a Candlestick all of gold with a bowl upon the top of it and set his seven lamps there own and seven potes to the seven lamps which are upon the top thereof the two olive trees by it one upon the right side of the bowl and the other upon the left side thereof so I answered and spake to the angel that talk with me saying what are these my Lord then the angel that talked with me answered and said unto me knowest thou not what these be and I said no my Lord then he answered and spake unto me saying this is the word of the Lord what is all of this what was these candlesticks and these olive trees and what are these all right he said he tells him what it is then he answered and spake unto me saying this is the word of the Lord unto zerubabel saying not by might nor by power but by my spirit sayth the Lord of hosts who art thou oh great Mountain before zerubu thou shal become a Plaine and he shall bring forth a headstone thereof with Grace with shoutings crying Grace Grace unto it moreover the word of the Lord came unto me saying the hands of zeru will have laid the foundation of his house his hands shall also finish it and thou shalt know that the Lord of hosts has sent me unto you now you'll know it when it's finished right for who ha despised the day of small things the prophet said God in Simplicity for they shall rejoice and see the plummet in the hand of jerub with those seven these are the eyes of the Lord which run to and fro through the whole Earth Earth then answered I and said unto him what are these two olive trees upon the right side of the Candlestick and upon the left side thereof and I answered and I answered again and said unto him what be these two Olive branches which brought the two which threw the two golden pipes into the golden oil out of themselves and he answered and said unto him knowest thou not what these be and I said no my Lord then said he these are the two anointed ones that stand by the lord of the whole earth you may be seated the Lord at his Blessing to the reading of the word now as I said the ones that were not here Wednesday get those and I hope there's a copy there's four four things there we're going to uh do a lot of reading today I hope to finish this morning but if not we won't worry about it now what were we what was the point we were trying to get across Wednesday okay now Moses was told in Exodus 25 about verse 31 I think it is and he was in also over in in um chapter is chapter 25:31 when he starts telling it you'll also find that over in Exodus U 37 but he was told to build a Candlestick now we know what the prophet has gave us the definition that it is not a candles stick because candles burn out all right but it is really called a lamp stand all right now in doing that he tells God tells Moses how to build it if you're looking there in Exodus 25 you'll notice verse 40 it tells him says look that thou make them after their pattern which was showed thee in the mount all right now over in Hebrews 8 and5 Paul refers back to the is and talks about how that Moses was told to make this lampstand Candlestick you know and bring it down now I told you Wednesday that the catch to what we need to see is that you for you to try to draw that he would have a horrible picture of trying to draw out what God told Moses cuz he told him to make uh shaes and branches and bowls and Knots which is B bubs and flowers and you got six branches here and six branches here and you got this to be done here and you got this to be done there and if you tried to draw that out You' go Haywire cuz you got bubs and you got um things made like pomegranates you got flowers in it you got all kind of things all right now that was what was told to Moses to build now to you that wasn't here if you're look on the back you'll see the uh seven uh lamp stand the the drawing you know that is made of the one that is uh the only one that I can find now there's others that are made uh you can buy them off of Internet you can order monora as they call them and uh like I told him Wednesday don't look up manora m a n o r right look up n m e n o r and you know but it's pronounced manora and in that is the the drawing of what Moses made you say well how do you know that was the one that Moses made because it fits what was told to build right and we went through that Wednesday I'm not trying to show you how intellect I am I'm sh trying to show you how perfect the word of God is all right so he W say we don't need intellect BL we need Revelation well let's hear your Revelation about the lampstands and all of the things you know if it don't fit what was draw they're made right all right so Moses doesn't go up there and build a whole bunch of bows you know build this build him a bowl build him build him a this building there he comes down and makes a lampstand and he makes makes it out of pure gold and it has no joints or nothing and it's solid one solid piece and I told you even if you think that you could screw out the middle and pour oil down in it I would forget that cuz it's one solid piece go ahead pour it in the bottom of the bowl and you know let it take care of but see Moses was told to build something natural all right to put in the temple okay now he was told to make cherubims but what did that do that only represented right he was to put a cherim over here and a chair them over here and with wings and all this that and the other and they were everything made out of gold it said it that David brought in 666 talet of gold a year and man we weighed it out done the best we could go the Old Testament give you 75 lbs to a talent and the new test to give you 200 so you know you got a lot of weight there anyway but they made those things and Moses was told to build it after the pattern if he hadn't seen it he wouldn't have known how to build that's my point all right see but then once he got it built then everything therea must fall back to the pattern that was given him all right now if you'll notice in Reading in Exodus he doesn't mention L the uh the uh two olive trees he do doesn't mention that in in Exodus all right it's mentioned in in in Zachariah now the point I'm trying to get you to see is one man makes a natural thing but that is only a symbolic that he made so was it with the fact that you'd build a cherubim you'd build this and you'd build that and you'd put this there all of those is only symbolics you know something to look at all right but Zachariah picks it up and as Zachariah is is doing it he's looking at the lampstand that Moses made cuz zachariah's way on over P Moses right and he's over there and he can look back and see what Moses made but see Zachariah is told to build or to take this and and to put it there and what it is see then he the seven golden candlesticks we read in Zachariah okay but in Zachariah then he's talked about the two olive trees well if you made that out you'd have a tree over here and a tree over here two olive trees you know I mean you you would try to make things out but why the point of it is if I don't mention this about 10 more times today I want you to remember one thing the olive trees is where you get the olive oil from all right so it's showing you where you get the oil from now hold on to that for a few minutes all right trying to get up to where we're at in a hurry okay now but he's shown the two olive trees that Moses was you know you'd add two more olet trees to your drawing but that won't work why why fool with it Moses had already been using the Candlestick the lampstand for hundreds of years before Zachariah come on the scene they were already using it in the temple that was to be put in to there and they had more than just one one king that ordered 10 at one time I remember reading and they were more than just one and they were only like three according to record that was kept Burning uh 24 hours a day some of the others were actually put out right and you know and because the symbolics of what you're holding but now listen to what I'm getting that Zachariah sees that Candlestick that's what he's shown he's got it in front of him maybe maybe he's in the temple when you know our part because Zachariah the restoration of the temple cleaning off and getting ready Ezra Nehemiah all but that's what I was trying to get you to see Wednesday night that once Moses built the Candlestick the lampstand you don't have to make a whole bunch more drawings right right from then on you're getting the Revelation and Moses then saying one thing build a lampstand that lampstand was made it had holes down through all those pipes running down in to the bottom all right Moses does not tell in Exodus what to do to get it to burn and that was what I was trying to get you to see Wednesday olive oil have would have to be put into the hundreds of hundreds of degrees to be able to make it light right okay you you you know what I'm talking about oil like that is not gasoline we're not talking about kerosene we're not talking about uh coal oil we're not talking about you know gas Under Pressure we're talking about you know olive oil okay now H I told my why something the other day some of you probably never thought of it you're going to gasp when I say it but even gasoline it it it's got a problem most of the time it's put under pressure and then you light it but if you ever made a flambo out of a plastic jug with gasoline you know a burning light flambo burning light right you can take a h you can take a gallon jug cut it in half pour it full of gasoline except don't let it roll run over don't let it run out pour it down in there very carefully couple of inches deep you strike a match and just stick it to it you're not going to blow the world up you're only going to light the center of that gas try it sometimes see if I'm wrong just make sure now I said don't spill none around don't let it get into where the vapors and things of that pour it in real carefully and you can just light it and it just sit there and burn for hours the only way that'll burn the plastic is when the gasoline is finally burned out you know you can boil water in the plastic bag right sure all right but now listen what I'm trying to get you to see is Moses didn't tell all the whole story he only Built what God told him but he knew the rest of the story how do you get the olive oil up to the top to be able to burn it all right I gave you the quote from the prophet he said what you do you put a wick in it right am all right now we're old enough brother George and us are old enough to remember the old lamps you know and we were burning and and you put the coal oil down in the bottom and you know the kerosene and you you had to have a wick you didn't like the kerosene it wasn't burn that way right gas will but kerosene wouldn't burn right off you got to get it hot all right so you put a wit down through and it was made out of wool or some kind of flax see the best was wool and you put that down in there and then you can just light that thing well you know it'll just keep burning cuz it's drawing that oil up out of the bottom of the bowl well look at your Candlestick the things you're looking at you just let them run right down in there and you light it brother R said you're the wick right I gave you the quotes I'm trying to get in a hurry all right he said you're the wick he said the wick is a Believer and that believer has to be able to walk with the word right all right now and in doing that see it would come out to show you that you would need some situation or existence to get the oil from so Zachariah is shown what he said this is the word of the Lord unto zeru the seven golden candlesticks the the uh two olive trees is the word of the Lord to zeru now what's Zachariah s he s the seven churches ages because there's your liand that's right amen your laand is your church ages and he's showing that and he's showing him where the olive oil comes from all right now we'll get back to that in a minute but I'm just trying to to move over real fast and not lose those that were not here but remember now Moses is not riding put a wick in it that was something else it came along right amen Moses is not talking about two olive trees that's something else that was coming on right that was things that would be brought into showing us the Revelation everybody understand what I'm saying now it would be something to show us the Revelation it continually unfolds because that lampstand back there was only to speak of the seven Church ages we'll get to it in a minute where the Prophet said they was seven in the old and seven in the new all right amen now so it shows the church edes it's showing I'm talking about the second coming of Jesus Christ what is the second coming the bride coming of Christ coming out of the church all right that's what your Prophet says and it's been taking place since the day of Pentecost amen that's right well you mean the second coming well that's where he started amen that's right it's going to be finished in this age and the most wonderful thing because no age outside of this age that's right would ever understand how that the Revelations 1 about 13 1213 that you'd see one standing in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks like unto the son of man G about the pouch which is women femish with a golden girl nobody could understand that until it's shown later see each one is unveiling it as each person sees it they're writing it like I said non he saw chariots josing in the street what do you see BU o mobiles running into each other down the highways running like lightning with torches in other words let have on that's what your Prophet said he saw he saw this day but how could he describe it chariots droping in the streets Ezekiel said he saw fire falling down out of Heaven nuclear destruction right he saw a wheel in the middle of the wheel draw that big old wheel Brother D With A Little Wheel in the middle yeah what do you mean you got two wheels what are you talking about see the Bible is unveiling the revelation of God that's why I preach that message there how that his coming is revealed in the Bible the prophet in Christ of mystery said it's revealed in every verse right all right now is everybody caught up a little bit from Sunday that missed that I mean Wednesday to where we can go on see Zachariah then is shown the candlesticks we got that the lampstand okay now he picks up in verse three he's shown two olive trees what is God showing Zachariah the word of the Lord amen all and what is he showing him where does the lamp get the olive oil from The Olive Tree amen and there's two of them you said well I understand that brother Dale that's most mes and Elijah okay that's all right but is that all of it is that all you see is that will that fulfill all of the things in the Bible or just Moses and Elijah because remember Moses and Elijah is to come after the Rapture so now what are we supposed to talk about okay now I want you to notice something I want you to read it here in in in Zechariah and then I want to turn over to the Book of Revelation chapter 11 so we'll pick up on these two ol trees now look in Zechariah 4 and 14 then said he these are the two anointed ones that stand by i y the lord of the whole earth now I tell you A lot of times I try to give you secrets and try to help you and and I don't believe you get it when I say write this down you know now like in school you know okay now when he in school and the teacher come along and the the teacher went through the book going you know read but it was your book and the teacher told you said if I was you I'd underline that word right there right right now you went to school right especially College people right now what do you mean well all of that she read was what was said in that one word right remember that one word so you're going to have a key so you don't have to remember I it said when the test come by you write down that one word now that's what I try to get you to see here the other day I said I said I'm going to say this four times how many remember what I said I was going to say four times in one sermon I want you to write it down am the quote was what that you'll never any be any closer to the fulfilling of God being visible Among Us than the headstone coming to the church right and how many of you wrote it down and thought on that that'll be very valuable about two messages later see I try to get you to see something the Bible run around and said don't have to be corrected he said it says what it means it means what it says right okay now Zachariah said these two anointed ones stand by B why Circle that b why okay now let's go over to Revelations and read it and you'll see that brother Dale is not an intellect he preaches by Revelation amen but you got to have the Revelation there's only one way to get it by the intellect that's right and you tell me how you're going to get it without it first being intellect okay so look at Revelations 11 verse three and I give power unto my two witnesses and they shall prophesy 1,23 score days clothed in sackcloth the these are the two olive trees now what two olive trees the two olive trees that Zachariah saw okay but once these are the two olive trees and the two candlesticks and Zachariah on is saw one Candlestick so added Revelation is coming two candlesticks but he keeps the two olive trees look where it's at though these are the two olive trees and the two candlesticks standing before not by right before the god of the earth well brother Dale that's just some two witnesses cuz that's what you're reading right there the two witnesses yeah try to draw that draw what is shown in the Book of Revelations and you got two candlesticks and you got two olive trees but why worry about that just think about adding God adding Revelation it's like Moses added a wick to bring the olive oil up into the top where you could light the wick the olive oil will only go into the wick and you light the wick and it draws the olive oil up through right that's your life I'm trying to show you the candlesticks the lampstands and seeing that it is Jesus Christ in the bride okay but now look how can this be fulfilled that one man sees him standing the two ol trees sees them standing by the Lord the other one sees it standing before the Lord now where in the scriptures can you find two olive trees standing by the Lord so you better find out what the olive trees are okay now keep in mind what does that mean I'm not being sarcastic nor hateful I'm trying to get you to think keep in mind Moses built what God showed him right but God didn't show him that that was the church ages God didn't show him the two ol trees God didn't show him the bride standing in the candlesticks those were things that unveiled as it's going on right like the the uh uh cherubims and cherubims wound up to be Angels later then Chans wound up to be preachers then Chans wind up to be people see see what Moses saw in the mount he built right now we asked the prophet because only by way of the Prophet can we get the symbolics right you agree y oh we got this symbol the uh I can show you go to scoffield and scoffield said that these two olive trees was was the two two witnesses over in Revelation because he could run the scripture you think he understood the denominations teach uh Revelation 6 that the six seal as a tribulation period do you think they know what that is so you can read Natural Things once you get a key you can just go from one to the other so if you got over here two olive trees and Zar you got two olive trees in the Book of Revelations and you say hey that must be the same too and these two are the two witnesses going to Israel so hey we got it well now do you have all of it remember these two over here are standing before they're not standing by the Lord okay all right prophet it we have to ask you we know by your understanding that Zachariah Moses this only put it formed as a top of it Zachariah begin to unfold unto us to be able to see uh the candlesticks and how they would represent things and then uh the seven over in the Book of Revelations you would pick up and you would find the the revelations one that there was the seven golden candlesticks and you'd find out that the scripture says that that is the church down through the seven Church ages that by the spirit of God all right so Zachariah know what he was talking about he saw it as the word of the Lord coming to zerubabel which zerubabel is a Tope of the end time messenger is what your Prophet said to bring the word of the Lord unto you and I right all right so we're taking the prophet's definition and putting it right back in Scripture it's all right now we have seen the church ages and what they are okay now the prophet gave us some great understandings if we would just follow those understandings so right now prophet of God what are these two olive trees well quote wait a minute let me get over a little further before you get there look what your Prophet had to say now we'll start reading some of our notes and if I have to I'll take this evening on this I don't worry about it so long as you get it we'll repeat it and if you got questions and answers we'll have that too I want you to see what I'm talking about right cuz only by seeing what it's talking about can you understand the Revelation well we don't need that all we need to know seven Church a represent right well did you know that before the prophet said it no well then the prophet said a lot of other things right amen amen so we need to know that now watch what your Prophet said on number 14 of your notes and watch him how how he's got this because over in in Zachariah you've got two olive trees and one lamp stand one Candlestick go back and read it but in Revelations you've got that we've just read verse 4 114 these are the two olive trees and the two candlesticks so now you got two candlesticks well brother random what does those two candlesticks mean we know you have told us the two olive trees are the Moses and Elijah right but see you didn't hear scoffield and them explaining about these two candlesticks CU they don't know what it means brother random what does it mean invasion of the US number 14 on you notes paragraph 39 PR 1954 509 in the Old Testament if the Lord will maybe in the coming Services I'd like to show how that the seven Church ages tyed out in the Old Testament how that they begun just exactly like at the beginning of the church ages of the Gentile church and went down through a similar Dark Age and come out into the Glorious time of Pentecost now he's talking about Old Testament all right I remember one time he was talking about Pentecost he said can't you see maram uh taking their tambourine and running down beside when they had conquered and went across and Miriam running along speaking in tongues he said you can coming down to the Pentecostal age he said talking about the coming to the Pentecost at the falling of the Holy Ghost in the new in the early church and then coming out Jewish dispensation all right now let's go on Matthew two or three Witnesses let's go down to the next one so we'll tie it all together patas Vision paragraph 153 196 1204 evening I just give you what's underlines you read the rest of it to make sure it's right he talks about the prophet sees it in a vision what does he see the two olive trees now what kind of what did they burn in those lamps in the Bible times does anybody anyone know oil what kind of oil olive oil two olive trees what is it the old the new and the Old Testament standing by it not before the old and the New Testament you said well how's it old how can it be old and new testament I thought it was just the two prophets cuz the old and the New Testament is where you going to get the oil from and the oil is the Holy Ghost am right all right so we're getting some keys to be able to understand a little bit going down to number 16 page 50 of the patmas vision which is 50 of the church age book He's explaining these two olive trees and what they are and he says it is Burning Brightly because it has plenty of oil which it's getting from the two olive trees now watch where he's getting it from which stand on either side see by the Lord Zachariah okay the two trees represent the Old and New Testament and of course the oil simplifies the Holy Ghost well now brother Dale you read one in invasion of the US in 54 so brother randam in 54 he just understood that it was you know was Old and New Testament well if I was you I'd go check the year the church AE book came out because the church AE book I just read out of in page 50 was only put out in 65 so don't say well that was he had this and he had that who alone can give light the light of God to the people the angel who spoke in Zechariah was as much as saying this is what you see means that the the church cannot accomplish anything by its own might or power but by the Holy Ghost right amen for that amen all right now but brother brandom you go on now to continue the understanding and what are you saying it where do you get the oil he said from the two candle the two olive trees and the two olive trees is the Old and New Testament you get anything outside the old and new Testament what do you got garbage can right what do you got man's interpretation what do you got denominationalism because you'll sputter and splat and won't work because it's not pure olive oil right pure olive oil will only come from the Old and New Testament does everybody understand that partner right do we need to stay on that cuz I can stay on it the rest of the day it doesn't matter to me I just want to make sure you understand do you understand the two Al Tru Prest represents the old and the New Testament well I just thought it meant Moses and Elijah well where does Moses and Elijah get their oil to bring to the church you know the 144,000 after the Rapture they get it from the old and the New Testament because by that time there will be an old and a new testament that's why that it's represented in the point of the opening of the word that there was seven candlesticks in the old test test there's seven in the new there was a bride in the Old Testament there is a bride in the New Testament right and they stand by the Lord yeah so brother randam let's continue on now where is it or what is it that we can see about these two prophets how that they will be the olive trees all right number 17 on your notes question question and answers 1964 8:30 the morning service paragraph 11:03 question 345 does Zachariah 4 and Revelations 11 3-12 speak of the same being what down the same being see Zechariah 41214 in Revelations 11:4 they signed her name right let's see Zechariah 4 oh yeah that's the two Olive Tree yeah the two olive trees and Revelation 11 is oh yeah that's it sign thing that's them both that that is Moses and Elijah the two olive trees cuz how's Israel going to get the message from the two olive trees right are you fathering go on down while we're reading we'll get a few out of the way still on questions and answers of 64830 the same book same thing but it's 11:25 question 370 and when Moses and Elijah comes on the earth which is Revelations and Zachariah brother comr your your your sister's question here was in the same when Zechariah 4 and Revelation 11 them two olive trees and so forth which is Moses and Elijah when they come on Earth they prophesy hund and so many days okay now don't look on down on the other notes and read them all right yet all right stay with me cuz you start reading you won't hear what I'm saying now you tell me you can I tell you can't but now listen can't we see then that Zachariah is shown three things y he shown lampstand he looks back to Moses he sees it he shown two olive trees showing Zachariah where the oil was going to come from was from the olive trees right which would be the word of God all then he shown something to take up another step he's shown where that's at he shown that it's going to be in the Bri right now he might not have understood all he was talking talking about about the bride but yet he was understanding right right now we can see then that Moses and Elijah can be the two olive trees we see then that the uh Old and New Testament is the two olive trees right now we are the bride the wick that burns in the light of the age that were living to bring light to the world right okay we must get that from the two olive trees so we don't get all we get from The Book of Revelations right we get the whole book right we're the only people that understand that we get the old and the New Testament you know you were told don't read Genesis cuz you can't understand it don't read Revelation because it's too much in symbolics brother R said the reason the devil don't want you to read those things is because Genesis shows his beginning and Revelation shows his ending he don't want you to understand that right he don't want you to understand the lampstands and the two witnesses right and the old and the New Testament because it was what now old and new so now you got two olive trees now the old and the the New Testament let me put this ahead of time the old and the New Testament understood in the correct order will be standing by the lord of the earth Zechariah The Book of Revelation said it's standing before so I'd hang on to that by for a minute now brother random where is there a place that this can all be fulfilled the Zechariah could see one lampstand and two ol trees and Revelation can see two olive trees and two lampstands one could say it was by the Lord the other one could say it was before we know for a certainty that the lamp stands would represent Israel as well as the bride because Israel was the Bride of the Old Testament she had seven Church ages I wish I could place all of them there's only just a few that brother brandham covers like I did there a minute ago you know that that showing it all right but he's the one that says it all right now notice something real careful okay cuz it has always bothered me you remember the other week I told you some things that bothered me it always bothered me how that the two olive trees would be the two witnesses but yet I knew the prophet had said that the two olive trees would be the Old and New Testament all right then the key come into being that the two being the old and the New Testament would be as Zachariah saw it by the Lord now was not his arm stretched at Calvary right for what reason the old and the New Testament right right amen are you with me I knew that it represented that I knew Zachariah said that this is the word of the Lord unable well we knew then after catching the message and coming into it that our dependence would be upon zerubabel as to be who he would be that it would be the end time messenger that would bring us to Revelation and the key was as I told you before when I read the Bible the first time in the Baptist Church and really reading it for me myself got converted 1958 in the Baptist Church and I began to read the Bible and when I came to Malachi 3 and Malachi 4 I told my wife I said according to the Bible here there'll be two prophets come before the end of the world I had not heard of The Prophet's message at that time I was only reading what the letter says but I always believed in Reading what the letter says these people talk about it already between the lines brother Dale yeah but if it's different from what's on the line then it's not right what's between the line cannot be anything different that's what I'm trying to get you to see Moses built exactly what God Said then God could add to Zachariah and understanding to open up to see more that it was the word of the Lord coming down through the people right who was the coming of the lord of the Old Testament oh Jesus Christ but it took Abraham Isaac Jacob Joseph Masterpiece I'm quoting to build a foundation look at that Foundation exactly what you're looking at that drawing on the pyramids you got a foundation there on I mean the drawing on your Candlestick you got a foundation he said but the prophets built the body so look at the body being built in the Old Testament but finally Hebrews 10:5 finally a body came into being was produced by the Old Testament I thought we believe that the New Testament would start off with the foundation Apostles and proph Jesus Christ being the Chief Cornerstone and that's why the book of Acts would be the foundation our standard right all right and then we would start through the church ages to bring the church ages and the theight in the end time of the church ages would would be that God would send Elijah so I asked brother mod I said what does that mean when he begin to talk to me about the message of the hour of Miki 4 I said well who's Malachi 3 he said well glad let you ask that I'm glad I run into a man that know the scriptures cuz always love to read and when he began to tell me the scriptures and telling me in Luke 1:7 how that John the Baptist was to come and fulfill and turn the hearts of the the the Old Testament people toward toward the New Testament message see and then he would tell me there and I could read the Bible that it didn't go on and say that that same Elijah turned him back and brother said see there if he did cuz that's what I asked him I said you know did it turn back he said cuz see that's what it was taught in organization if you read that scripture where it says and the disobedient unto the something they'll use that scripture there in Luke 1:17 and they'll say well see there he turned him right back brother Mo said if he turned him back said he turned him back to the Old Testament said where would you have salvation said John turned him from the Old Testament to the new right said this Prophet has to turn us back to the faith of the father amen I said thank you I got the scriptures right that's right I knew who the two prophets were not two what was it Spirit of Elijah spirit amen okay now but the old and the New Testament stands in a perfect position because it stands on either side of the of the god of Glory right but Z but Revelation says that they stand before well now according to my understanding is I'm walking over to them on tape and I'm looking at something out here in front of me that means it's before me that little thing there that holds where they sing from it's before me all of them instruments are before me but see that wouldn't give the idea so where in the Bible can you read a a position or a situation right where can you read a situation in the Bible to verify that the old and the New Testament was standing beside the Lord do you know write it down write down your answer CA this was a thing I told you that always wondered about the old and the New Testament and the two witnesses but there was more that I wondered about I wondered about something that happened in the Bible go to Matthew 17 okay and let's read you got it and after 6 days Jesus taketh Peter James and John his brother and bring them up into a high mountain apart okay and was transfigured transformed in other words before them and his face did shine as the sun and his rment was white as the light and behold there appeared unto them Moses and Elias talking with him now you see I know what this scripture means your Prophet knew what it meant too let's read what he said look back at your notes see we take Matthew 17 as speaking of adoption and hear ye him right this is my beloved son in whom I please to dwell here ye him that's what we cover but that's not the right angle of the scripture that's not the right sense that it's in let's read number 19 on your notes Here your hymn 1958 0301 and he's going to preach on adoption but watch it and now we could take a lengthy time on this and we could take it from many different angles truly the right angle to take this from is by way way of the second coming of the Lord you see where I've been preaching for 15 sermons to get to this okay so listen today please I got something in there if you need it laying on my desk if you need something to keep you awake it's a piece of pepper about that long did you want to go eat it I'm sure you won't go to sleep okay now watch that right angle to take this from is by way of the second coming of the Lord but brother Dale it's it's only adoption hold your point and listen you out there that hear it hold your point and listen read what your Prophet says he knew this was the order of the second coming he knew it that's what he's saying and perhaps maybe your pastor has taught you this many times on how that the order of the scripture how perfect it is the second coming of the Lord first the Moses and Elijah and then he looked and saw just Jesus only all for shattering or picturing the coming of the Lord the second time but tonight we want to approach it from another angle so he goes to adoption okay look at the next one here ye himn 58 328 so we find him here going up to the Mount as we call it Mount Transfiguration always like to look at it in the real sense that it is wrote in look at that most all ministering Brethren approaches it as a type of the second coming of the Lord and that is true but there is not one scripture in the entire Bible but what will dovetail and connect with the next scripture every bit of it every bit it is one great big picture all the way from the Garden of Eden and the way of Calvary back to the Garden of Eden just one beautiful picture talking about a jigsaw puzzle down below it all right let's read number 21 while you have 1955 225 Jesus had just been taking Peter and James and John they went up in a mountain to show the coming of the Lord he said now notice what he said to show the coming of the Lord he said some stand here shall not see death until they see the kingdom of God coming in power now the only one that saw that was John right come on your Prophet said that John goes to patmas and sees the climax the coming of the Lord all right cuz he said there'd be some standing here and he went up and showed them just what would take place in the mount what what's going to take place the things pertaining to the second coming of the Lord and when they did the first thing they saw what did they see Jesus glorified that's the next thing the church will see here on Earth is the coming glorified Jesus amen number 37 on your notes at the end of it you'll find brother random saying on the Easter seal don't turn over and read it cuz we're going to read these other one that he says that glor the adoption glorifies Jesus Christ okay let's read on down here yeem 1957 5:19 and now as he comes and then this had another meaning to it I know many of you my brethren the clergymen you apply that to the coming of the Lord that's right night it was applied there the order of the coming Christ and they looked and they seen glorified Jesus they looked again and seen Moses and El the two witnesses Revelation 11 and they look back and seen Jesus only exact with the order order the the coming glorified Christ of preaching to the Jews then Jesus coming with his bride okay hear ye him 1957 807 and the real correct approach to this text tonight is the order of the second coming of Christ how that first he saw Jesus then Moses and Elijah and then Jesus only truly that is in perfect harmony with the second coming of Christ and he had said just previous to this many stand here that shall not see death till they see the son of man in his glory that was a prefigure of his coming in glory hear you him 196 3133 I believe as perhaps all ministers are many of them knows that this setting meant the coming the order of the coming of Christ the first thing they saw and how the order was they seen Jesus which was to appear then they seen the coming of the glorification and Jesus was to appear and then they seen the coming of the glorification and Moses and Elijah the very order of the second coming and when they look back they saw Jesus only trying to read to you a bunch what brother Rand had to say about it who is this Mel chz 1965 221 evening service number 21A on your notes there was a man man named Moses everyone knows that's a prophets called the eagle in the Bible and there was a prophet named Moses and one day God called him and wouldn't let him go over the land and he he died on the Rock the Angels took him away and buried him there was another man an eagle didn't even have to die he just walked across Jordan and God sent a chariot down and this robe of Flesh he dropped and he dropped and rise and CAU the Everlasting price 800 years later 800 years later on Mount Transfiguration there stood two men Moses body had been rotten for hundreds of years but here he was in such a form till even Peter James and John recognized him amen if this Earthly body be dissolved if you're an attribute of God express your own Earth you got a body waiting for you leave waiting for after you leave this world there was there they was standing on Transfiguration in their theophany for they were prophets to whom the word came to now if you look back over at verse three of re of Matthew 17 you'll find a good key and behold there appeared unto Moses and Elish talking with him talking with him wouldn't you like to know what they were talking about well you know what they were talking about they were talking about to him that he was going to Calvary they were talking to him about his second coming that he didn't know when would take place it was withholding from him right they were talking with him you say them talking to God yep because they were already entered into their theophany he was glad to talk to them that's right he was the word they were the word right amen oh you know well let's read it then adoption 1965 22 evening all right I tell you one that wasn't which Jesus was referring back to something that happened Jesus Took Peter James and John and went up to the Mount Transfiguration one time and was standing on top of the mountain and Jesus who was placing his son like I'm trying to had the other night placing son and when they did they looked around and found out there stood Moses and Elijah they were talking communing not little white flags floating around or little white clouds rather floating around but they were men talking Moses had been buried in an unmarked grave for 800 years and Elijah went home in a chariot 500 years and here they both was till just as much alive as they were ever was alive standing there talking to him before he went to Calvary Hallelujah now he said with brother Dale why would that thrill you so much why would that uh break your heart we know about this we know about that we know about the two witnesses but you see this is the only place in the Bible that Moses and Elijah was standing not before but they were standing by the Lord John sees them later standing before Zachariah showed a beautiful picture right I not understood what it was all about but he says these are the two that stand by the Lord say well that's over there the second coming and all these that and the other see that's where you're tied up at that's where all of us was tied that's where I was tied that's why I couldn't understand sure I've preached on these things many times but if I was you I'd listen sometimes I've always tried to make the statement to you that when I preach something over again it's because I've received further Revelation not to reh hatch the same things because if you know I've never preached Daniel 70 weeks again if you notice I've never preached the seals again you know in an order of 1 2 3 4 I didn't feel it needed to be I'm trying to bring you something from my heart these two witnesses stand before the Lord at is coming I see you got his coming out you under you got his coming to Israel in the tribulation is that not true why would brother brandom take a thought like this and say I know this scripture here and I gave you quote after quote is talking of the second coming of the lord it's the order of the scriptures it's the placing of the scriptures he said he said I want to give you another point I want to use it in a little different way what's he talking about okay patas Vision 19612 1204 number 27 on your notes taken up to the mountain well back up above there he says everything had to be established in the mouth to three Witnesses so he took up Peter James and John for the three witnesses to see what was going on they take up Jesus on the mountain he take him up and he was transfigured before them transformed his realm and Shine Like the Sun in the middle of its strength and there appeared unto him Moses and Elijah what is this son of man coming in now the first will appear Moses and Elijah right okay keep reading and notice before Jesus returns to the earth now this is a little ahead of time but the spirit of Elijah will return back to the Earth and turn the hearts of the children back to the fathers right the Bible said so Jesus saw him here are you reading Jesus saw him here the apostles saw him here the order of the coming of the son of man glorified he's to be glorified coming back first thing before they saw him what was what was what Elijah then what Moses Israel returning Yonder the lawkeepers and then the glorified son of man Hallelujah do you see the order of his coming the spirit of Elijah are the witness of the Life Church age see coming in power to manifest him right so what is Matthew 17 talking about the coming of the Lord that Elijah is going to come first right the number four time to the Gentile bride right remember he comes five times the other time he comes to Israel okay 70 weeks of Daniel 1961 806 he talking about the two prophets what they do Moses and Elijah they rise on the scene they'll tell those Jews they're mistake and out of that Jewish Bunch that there's now to be 144,000 God will call with these prophets what is it the spirit of Elijah off of this Gentile church amen will just continue right on into that Jewish Church go right on in and call Moses with him now brother brandom's not the one going to Israel right but the spirit off the Gentile church is the spirit of Elijah hallelujah amen brother ROM say this who who did he say Elijah was he said it's the spirit of the Lord Jesus Christ Elijah of this day is the Lord Jesus Christ right see what are you saying brother Dale we'll get to it in a minute all right number 30 on your notes now in Matthew 16:28 which is page 62 of the patmas vision Church AG book now in Matthew 1628 prefacing or coming before Matthew 17 1-13 Jesus said there be some standing here which shall not taste death till they see the son of man coming in his kingdom right now watch it and the three Apostles did see just that the order of his second coming they saw him transfigured there on the Mountaintop his rment was Blazing white and his face Shone like the sun in its Zenith and there appeared stood Moses and Elijah on either side that is exactly how he's coming again listen truly Elijah will come first come and turn the hearts of the children bride back to their father's Apostolic word Doctrine so are you catching it here are you hmn 57125 31 on the notes and perhaps maybe I'm going to take it in a little different angle it really represents the coming of Christ a second time on the appearing of Moses and Elijah and then Christ only but it represents something more what does it represent the second coming of Jesus Christ in the spirit of Elijah that's the only time in the Bible that you'll find Moses and Elijah standing beside the Lord Jesus Christ someone show it to me the Book of Revelation they're standing before Zachariah know exactly he said it exactly listen here you himym 1957 310 32 in your notes now my brother theologians I know the real meaning the significance of this was the coming of the Lord the order of the coming Moses and Elijah to appear and then they look back and saw Jesus only but tonight it's approaching it for tonight let's approach it for a few minutes under another way cuz all the scriptures ties together there's no loopholes can you see what I'm talking about well let's read the next one here you himm 1957 807 but we want to take a new route on this tonight another way around because every word of God DB tals together there's no contradictions in the God's word it's like to see the scripture that con I'd like to see the scripture that contradicts itself that cannot be straightened by the same scripture if it is written surely in Parables because it is purposly did that way to confuse the wise and pruda that God might reveal it to babes such as would learn you see why that it thrilled my heart God I always knew that Matthew 17 had something to do with the second coming of Jesus Christ not just his first coming his second coming and what about his second coming I've tried my best to get it over to you that second coming started on the day of Pentecost is going to finish in this last days what with the spirit of Elijah that come forth to bring us the word and a little old Prophet when he died he didn't take it with him cuz your Prophet said the spirit of Elijah all of the Gentile bride would go to Israel I know that's hard for some people to swallow I didn't say it your Prophet did argue with him it's true but it perfectly fits because the spirit off of this Gentile bride is the spirit of Elijah which is the Lord Jesus Christ right see Moses and Elijah standing on Mount Transfiguration is the keyn note to tie the whole Bible together cuz it takes the new and the old right amen okay and brings it together so they can stand by the Lord because Elijah's got it had to come before Jesus could come before Moses could go to Israel and you know that the Jews actually believe that Elijah will precede the coming of the Messiah you don't believe that I'll give you some names to get a hold of it'll tell you about it the Jews believe that the that Elijah will precede the coming Messiah abely amen that's exactly right he just preceded it his message amen but you and I must be that message am amen not talk about it right be the message amen cuz it's not a talked about word that's going to Israel they'll take this message to Israel it will not be as one brother preached years ago that the two witnesses would be a gentile prophet and a gentile bride I told him then no brother Randon said he' be two Jews of course he didn't like what I said that's all right I just told him what brother Randon said brother man said there' be two Jews he said they won't receive it now you said well now wait a minute Elijah was a gentile well I can't explain that I just tell you what he said he said it'd be two Jews and go to Israel because they wouldn't accept nobody else see that's just the way I am I just read it and I see it that's why I do it I read the Bible I see it that way I read it for what it says I don't read it in Baptist GES or Methodist or two souls or seven Thunder virt PR River Jordans or whatever right I read it for myself but but that RAR has bothered me that I knew that Matthew 17 had to do with the second coming of Jesus Christ but I couldn't see how it would tie together until I saw those two prophets standing by the Lord and that's the only place in the Bible they stand by the Lord is on the Mount of transfiguration There Was Elijah to come to the Gentiles to bring the word and there was Moses that will go to Israel amen and this Spirit of Elijah will just come right off this Gentile bride and go right on with Moses amen finish up the Bible of what Moses saw in Exodus 25 when he saw seven golden candlesticks Zachariah saw it as the word of the Lord Matthew saw it is the actual coming and those two witnesses talking Moses and Elijah talking to Jesus John we don't want to be over there where he saw it it means we missed it come on Brothers take on these things sorry to be a little bit lengthy this morning I generally cut off a good bit before now but I'm sorry but I wanted to get it to you of the order of his second coming now I'm going to say it all right you got your pencil I'm going to say it okay don't come upside I didn't hear you say that well your brain was shut off or something happened cuz I'm going to say it there is no second coming of Jesus Christ outside of a mount Transfiguration experience of adoption that is the day that we're living in is the adoption time that's why the brother brandham knew that listen he said I'm going to take it from another approach you don't think he was just using the scriptures because it had hear ye himym in it he wanted to use it hear ye himm is the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ write that down adoption brings Jesus Christ on the scene as much as he let ever be here before we meet him in the air so brother brandom said I'm just going to take it from this but he was showing the greatest mystery of all the Mysteries that a bride of Jesus Christ is going to be adopted in the last days not a play pretty come on let's anybody would you sing a verse or two cuz it's not 2 minutes till 12 and I'm sorry let you have heard ofes you heard a Fearless David and
