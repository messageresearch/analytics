you're just a part of us because we don't have anything to join we don't have it like that we're just a group of believers and all but we say to you welcome and we're going to have a baby dedicated station in just a moment and and i want your the people at lula and on the internet to look around when you see this and see how many people has come out for this baby dedication even from california and texas what new jersey all over the whole united states to come for the dedication of a baby now that's what i call being a family's you know i i honor that i cherish that because of of that being but you know we're glad to have everybody remember now there will not be any evening service this afternoon we will be uh eating together and fellowshipping together downstairs and all and just having a good time doing that and uh rem let's see brother aaron will be preaching for us the lord willing wednesday so remember that and pray the lord would bless all right i guess you can be seated for a moment and we'll have the family if they will if brother dick if you'll sing that bring them in we'll have the families on both sides to come up and there's going to be more standing up here today for the dedication of this baby than there was in this church when we first started but all of you come up all both sides now come on not just a few kids and all everybody come up even to the future back there that's trying to we was laughing yesterday there's one of them he's trying to impress his future father-in-law or something and he's trying to get by without having to give too many goats for a diary but every how you say those words but we're glad to have all of you here and you just come and gather around bring them in bring them in bring the little ones to g he says bring them in just gather around on both sides cause it'll take bring the little ones to jesus amen we don't believe in infant baptisms that's what a lot of people believe and they got their ideas but we believe that it's just like the lord jesus done you know they brought their little children to him and he blessed them well then that's one thing that we believe in doing we believe in blessing them and believing in putting them under the blood of jesus christ and that way then you know we can not have to be worried we can depend on him to to take care of everything with the child and and everything will be all right okay so we come to that point and we have like i said we have the we call them here we're kind of funny southern we call them in-laws and outlaws you know i mean that's my mother's saying and her saying was not right we think she counted the kids to be the outlaws all right and the daughter-in-laws and son-in-laws to be the the good ones that was just her way of doing it but we are certainly glad to be here and do this let's just have a word of prayer before we go into the dedication all right heavenly father we thank you for this day an opportunity to be able to come together

around talking and and having a good time in in fellowship and we pray that the lord would bless you can go ahead musicians can go ahead and be seated you know but uh as we come to our scripture time let's all stand together now and we'll we'll read our scripture and uh going into the part of the service we're going to read from john 20 11-17 and let's just pray before we read the scripture father we thank you for this day and we praise you in your great name we know that this is the time that everybody will be fellowshipping today around the resurrection and truly it was the time that you proved who you was because no man had ever been able to raise themselves up we know that elijah and then different ones could have could have had a part to do with you and using him to raise the dead but no man had ever been able to raise himself but yet you raised yourself up out of that tomb and walked forth and we thank you for that and we come to the time now to where that we is we dedicate a baby to you lord but we dedicate ourselves as a new under the resurrection and to walk in the newness of life we love you and we thank you in jesus name amen john 20. we just read this part of the about the resurrection you know this was the first day of the week that they came and said verse 11 said but mary stood without it the separation weeping and as she wept she stooped down and looked into the supplementer and see if two angels in white sitting the one at the head and the other at the feet where the body of jesus had laid and they say unto her woman why are we pushed out she saith unto them because they have taken away my lord and i know not where they have laid him and when she had thus said she turned herself back and saw jesus standing in you not that it was jesus remember he's turned back to be a young man he wasn't standing there with a bloody robe right he wouldn't the resurrection is about what he'd done for you and i but that's what he'd done for us he wasn't standing there with a bloody robe on with scars all over the only thing he had left was the nails in his hands to where we could remember that so just remember that part and knew not it was jesus jesus saith unto her woman why we forced out whom seeketh doubt she's supposing him to be the gardener saith unto him sir if thou have borne him hence tell me where thou has laid him and i will take him away jesus says unto her mary she turned herself and saith unto him rabboni which is to say master jesus saith unto her touch me not for i have not yet ascended to my father but go to my brethren and say unto them now listen to this i ascend unto my father and your father to my god and your god mary magdalene came and told the disciples that she had seen the lord and that he had spoken these things unto her you may be seated the lord add his blessing to the reading of the word now we don't have to worry today you know because we're not speaking we are speaking to people who know this message and know what we believe so we're not you know the families know of the things that we believe in the you know and have been following the message themselves and we appreciate that but you know we're in a world in a time when there'll be a lot of services held today around the world and a lot of beautiful sermons and things will be done and in all and we just you know we we appreciate all of that and there'll be a lot of things said about the resurrection and said about because of this and because of that and this happened and that happened and great descriptions will be made and churches are putting on all kind of programs to show you know what is is what they believe and that's all well and good and uh the churches will be filled with great uh beautiful flowers and and things to you know talk about a resurrection and all like that and there'll be many people in church today that won't be back in church the rest of the year but at least they're there today so that's that's good on that you know to do it uh and you know and i appreciate all that i i'm one that really believes in us you know being the christians to show what we are but i'm kind of i'm a little different a lot of people as i said will approach the resurrections and the things and i've just never been a type of preacher to preach a sermon about you know whatever the event is i'm not that away i'm always you know in in this take whatever i get and i preach from that you know but we we have more visitors with us today that you know that are we're not of the uh the family and dedicating of the baby now genie over here and good to see her and we have some a couple of brothers up here we're glad to see you and uh you know just make yourself at home you come back we won't have a service this evening but you come back again you won't be welcomed that's not worth saying anything you come one time you get welcome it comes second time you don't get welcomed no because you just become a part of us we don't have anything to join up with uh i've been in dale for 74 years and they never did ask me to join the family matter of fact they probably tried to put me out of it but you know that's all right but i want to just read a scripture and take a little thought and talk for a little bit to you about what's on my heart of of the things of where we've been related in what we've been speaking on and bringing it through the scriptures so go ahead brothers and pull up malachi 3. i love this scripture as we read it and you know it says something that's very impressive to me that you'll see in a minute will relate to the resurrection because if i'm a firm believer if this part of the scripture is true this part of the scripture is true you know i don't believe that god comes this way and then he comes different over here i don't believe in a changing god i believe a god that is unchanging in all of his nature his ways and his doing and in doing that then you know we can depend on it and i love this scripture so watch what it says it says for i am the lord now notice capital lord means a lot to me because that's the way that i preach and and try to help you to understand that when you see the lower cases and the upper cases in the bible you have a great understanding if you'll follow it that way because one can be lord here on earth the other is the god of glory all right but just think about it now watch what he says look look at what he's talking about the kind of god that we believe in he said for i am the lord i change not all right now mankind has always tried their best to change god right try to make him fit what they are their ways their concept or whatever you know are doing but he he says and notice now this is malachi which is malachi is the last chapter of the old testament all right so as it winds up he says i am the lord i change not now well i love that next part of the verse therefore you sons of jacob are not consumed remember old testament he's ending it the sons of jacob you know all right so you think about it if god changes what can you depend in you know what can you depend on is he like us you know we're in a day in a time of changing changing changing and a lot of good things with a lot of bad things you know we we came to church this morning and in good air conditioned cars and it rode real good and all but you know wasn't very long ago we were riding in old rough a models and beating up down the road and hoping we was going to get there you know you know but times changes but you know god doesn't change now that's wonderful that he doesn't change right see if we can depend on that and anchor that down in our thoughts then you know it says that the sons of jacob therefore are not consumed do you realize if god changes what's that saying if he changes there's a possibility of you and i being consumed we don't have no hopes if he changes but if he don't change if we can find his ways and we can find in the scripture what it declares about him then we can at least have hopes of not being consumed or destroyed you know done away with all right we can depend on that and we can we can do it but you notice that it said it's the capital lord that comes from the greek word and i'm not a scholar i just read a little but it comes from the word elohim which means a self-existing one now that self-existing one he never changes all right now you've heard the prophet make this statement many times if god ever does one does something one time he has to keep doing it the same because if not see he's changing all right see and if he saved one person by the blood faith in the blood in the old testament he had to save everybody faith in the blood he doesn't have an old testament salvation and a new testament one now he changes his form and the way he does things may go on into different and it does the old testament you know they were the people of god back there but jesus christ had not come and died so they could not have the eternal life dwelling within them in their soul that you and i can because that would that was the old testament form but it's not a changing of gods you know it's the same god it's the way he's dealing and what he's dealing with all right so then now the old testament winds up saying that he's the lord now we don't believe in trinitarianism i mean if you do that's your choice but i've just just you know i've been around too long i was telling them yesterday they said how long i've been preaching i said 45 years well after 45 years i want to be able to tell you what i believe you know i've had a long time to practice it and to learn about it and i believe in one true and living god all right and then that one true and living god as the he doesn't change now see if you say oh i believe in a trinity all right then look what you've got you've got the possibility of him changing from one person to another person to another person well i don't believe it that way dover the dale i i just believe it's god in three persons well now you're right back to the old trinitarian concept or thought you're just deceiving in your words because according to the webster's dictionary a person is a personality personality is an individual individual is a person so if you've got three persons in god look what you've got who's the oldest you know who created who come on brother i mean i'm sorry i'm southern i'm country as cornbread it can be i guess but i'm just plain at least you not deceive what i'm talking about you can at least say well i heard him say it that's what he believes all right see i believe the old testament declares one true and living god the first commandment is what the old oliver the lord not god is one all right see then he can't come up and have a different god in the new testament because he'd be changing all right see then as it ends in the old testament that i'm god and i change not all right see then we can make a depend you know depend upon the fact of saying the old testament declares the great eternal god to be won all right now we have a lot of people in the world today who try to come up with different words of yahweh jehovah etc uh what his issues whatever others from the old testament forms that you know they want to try to make a fancy statement or make you think they know something by telling you all about it but i'm just plain old country boy you know i i just believe that i'm a father i'm a son and i'm a human being i'm a pastor of a church i retired from general motors i have many many titles but only have one name right see my name being samuel i just have that one name i don't have now my wife though she does a lot of times she called me daddy you know cause we're all that but but see i'm not her daddy to her i'm her husband all right to my children i'm their father to the grandchildren i'm their grandfather the great-grandchildren see i have many many titles to me but i still just have one name well they've all developed here so everybody here at the church you know they they don't even say brother dale most of the time they call me poppy because that's what i am it's just to everybody it doesn't make no difference because you know and we one little boy we were having a testimony meeting one night and you know this little little black black boy he got up and he said i want i want to thank poppy for letting me call him poppy well he meant it he meant it and he knew that i mean it too uh you know but now get what i'm saying now the old testament then doesn't declare one form of one god or some way in the new testament another it has to declare the same and that way we can depend on it and we can surely believe then as i said i'm ought about because talking about a resurrection all right now i'm like this if that old testament god was not the god that raised in the new testament what have you got a new testament right you've got another god you've got another being you've got something else to deal with and you're trying to satisfy both of them and you don't know how to handle it but if we believe that the jehovah the old is jesus of the jew his name was never pronounced back there not saying that the word jesus was never used no because they used it but remember he said well he was jehovah but remember he said during the scripture he said by my name jehovah was i never known i quoted that to the jehovah witness people one day you know kind of shocked him i said he said by his name jehovah he's never known because jehovah's not a name it's jvhv or the different ways of bringing it and in doing it they could not pronounce it because it had no vowels or what you call in it you know to make it come out so they pronounced it jehovah which means like father with his family all right and there was a time that he was those things but times changes people but it don't change god right now that old testament god when he came over here he said standing on earth one day jesus said unless you believe that i am he you'll die in your sins now who's the he that he was speaking of right see the bible don't declare one god this away and another god that way that's man's concepts and ideas it declares to god to be the same all right and it required then that you know that he would have to come into the world and we got that old concept that there it was before the world you know and all and the father son and holy ghost was up there and and you know the father looks around and says who's going to go pay the price we we've got sin so the son steps up and said let me go daddy you know well that's a good thought but now suppose that you were standing in that situation and there you was and your son was standing there and one of you is going to have to die right you get the point you know one's gonna have to die you say goodbye son that's not too good of a dad right that's right would there be any choice in your mind would there be any thoughts about you or to say well okay you go boy no see that's what we think and we don't realize the confusion we get into the trinitarian thought that god sent his son sure we read scriptures but scriptures are deceiving i can read you one scripture that says judas went and hung himself right i can read you another and said you go do likewise now i quoted you the scripture but see there's something wrong with you you've got a god that changes i'm talking about it god that does not change and as that old testament ended it ended if i asked most people today you know in the religious realm you ask them and say where's the first book of the new testament and they'll turn to matthew that's not the new testament the law was still in existence while jesus christ was alive the first book of the new testament is the book of acts right come on because that's where god came back into the people to prove the resurrection had taken place he proved it by coming and living in the people the same god there was just no way that old testament form of god could be in the basis of giving life to people like we needed it so he had to come into flesh the bible said in him dwell up the fullness of the godhead bodily john 1 1 what in the beginning was the word word is with god and the word was god and the word verse 14 was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld him as the only begotten of the father what god hebrews 10 5 what did it say a body thou has prepared me see that old testament people lived their lives and things and brought forth god into a way that he could finally step on earth into a human body and dwell here with us in that human body see then that was the one that would come over and be able to give his life nobody else couldn't do it there's no man i don't care how much you think you could do there's no man could die the way he died if that wasn't god we're the worst deceived people in the world because there's no way that man could do what he went through and still keep his sanity and keep his point till all he had to do was just say end it stop it that's all he had to say he didn't have to say just move his hand the bible said a legion of angels would come to his aid it didn't take but one wormwood to destroy the world with water so what would you need with thousands of them you understand what i'm getting at i'm talking about that god there had to be the very god that would come into the new testament and live in the in the world with us and then he could say unless you believe that i am he you'll die in your sins all right i believe that's who he was helped you see see you can't have a god of the old testament and the god of the new and turn out to be the way that we believe it or in point all right so if the old testament ended with declaring you know that i'm god and i changed not you know i am the lord and i change not then we get over the book of revelations which would be the final book written in the new testament and he declares there he says i'm the alpha omega the beginning and the end right it would have to be the same god living or else we've changed somewhere all right now i love this scripture so pull it up hebrews 13 8 i love that if you really just looked at the scripture just look at it and read it and always say you know we're not making jokes or making fun of nobody but you know these glasses belong to me uh you know well i used to read by somebody else's glasses you know what i mean when i was in the baptist i had baptist classes right because for some reason then words changed according to what i was reading through how about you but then one day you know i got me a pair of glasses of my own yeah i was able to read well read the bible for yourself look what it says jesus christ the same yesterday and today and forever translate that into thinking of our modern ways of saying jesus christ the same yesterday even today and even forever the word and can be translated and or even right now what about the new testament declaring that type of god wouldn't that be perfectly sitting to where he would be saying i'm god and i change not right now he's if he's hebrews 13 8 that doesn't mean that it started in jesus standing on earth that's the way we want to translate that we translate hebrews 13 8 as saying when he's come on earth that was yesterday you know and today and forever no in simple language if he was yesterday that was the beginning and then all the way through would be now and the ending up he would still be the same when you get to heaven what are you going to see you know if you're a trinitarian what are you going to have you're going to have one sitting on the throne and you're going to have a halo of light floating around over this way and you're going to have some kind of dove that they try to explain and all and then you're going to have a father sitting over here this old looking guy a young guy you got it all confused to me i'm just that's beyond my thinking jesus said unless you believe that i am he philip one day said show us the father that it suffice or satisfy us what did he say he said philip have i been so long with you and you didn't know me he said if you've seen me right he said you've seen the father why because god was living in that flesh or else he was lying you know i mean come on he said what is it now if he's the lord and he changes not then that same lord would have to be the one that would be saying the same yesterday amen old testament today when he was living on earth and forever he will always be the same and he'll never change we're not going to get up to heaven and find out we're looking around trying to find jesus why because you're going to see jesus and know who that is right amen i'm a firm believer in a world of brothers asking some questions yesterday about the millennium i'm a firm believer in in being human i mean these musicians they got it on me i can't play well we got up to heaven there wouldn't be no thing as passing out instruments to play right you know what i mean i couldn't play anyway i just said give it to somebody else but everybody thinks we're gonna sit on the cloud float around play harps all day long now i'm sorry that'd be boring to me i think we're going to have a good time we're going to be able to fellowship we're going to be able to talk about this world and how we lived and how that the brothers flew from california when come down from new jersey just to get to see the grandbaby it was dedicated to the lord he said well you're a funny fellow will you tell me what you think heaven's going to be right i mean even the old ending didn't believe in god and the way we talk about it he had a happy hunting ground he had a place to go to i want to be human don't you it'd be wonderful we won't have to eat but we can eat if we want to right you don't have to worry about all the things of the world there won't be nobody hurting anybody there they won't be all those things be a beautiful day and i'm looking forward to that right to have a wonderful time and what about you know i can sit down and talk to you for a million years and just be a split second yeah that's right of earthly time you know it'll be a wonderful day that's the kind i believe but you see if he's if he's hebrews 13 8 all right then we can depend on the new testament declaring him to be a god that does not change and then if we go to john 1 as we were quoting then in the beginning was the word the word was with god and the word was god you know that word created all things according to hebrews 1 john 1 colossians 1 the word was the creator you know that james tells you who that creator is he said it was jesus christ all things were made by jesus christ now not made by the flesh jesus that was a human element that element had to be made eternal in the resurrection but the god that was living in there was the very god of glory see then all he done was just change his form to where we could comprehend and he moved over into a form if you want to call it or whatever and he began to say let there be let there be and the world came into being but that same god could stand on earth and said bring me some fish right bring me some fish you got anything to eat yeah we got a few pieces of bread and a few fishes he said bring him he just stood there and multiplied it out proving to be the same god amen all right but you know one day he really proved a lot of things we can go through because in exodus when moses met the burning bush he said go down there and tell them tell them that i'm sending you he said wait a minute i know and he reads it read it in there he said i know you're the god of abraham isaac and jacob moses knew that because of what he was looking at but he said i'm not going to egypt without a personal experience or something that i can be sure of myself he said what name should i say he said tell them i am that i am moses gets his sticks goes to egypt he had all he needed was something personal to himself about god you know it's amazing how that over in john 8 and 15 58 when jesus was standing there one day and talking to him about abraham he said before abraham was i am not that flesh no the flesh had a beginning but the god that was in there was speaking and i was quoting a while ago when he said philip have i been so long with you he wasn't meaning philip you see this flesh no you were talking about the one that was inside of there but see it took a death burl and a resurrection to bring forth this person that we talk about but see wherever changing has said the prophet of god said it like this one day he said man has changed the one god into three deceiving the world by their doctrines and ideas see if he is god then let's respect him as god and let's believe him as god whether he's not let's eat drink and be murray because tomorrow we die and forget the whole thing but we see that he changes maybe his form that he does because that's in colossians he said he was in the form of god that word form is like in morphe the prophet says changing from one form to another so like i said about my wife i'm i'm her husband the kids i'm their daddy the grandkids i'm grandpa see i've got many forms and god has done that through time to reveal himself to mankind but that's what i want to end the whole talk with today of thinking about the greatest time if i ask you if i ask you today what would be your thought of the greatest uh time event or whatever took place you know the flood crossing the red seas the the whatever you know the water turned to wine the different things what would you say is the greatest of all to prove that malachi is right when he said i changed not and hebrews is right when he says i'm the same yesterday today and forever revelation ends it up saying that i am the alpha and omega the beginning and the ending what would be the time of life that you would pick sure there had to be a time when a baby was born that's good sure we believe that that baby was emmanuel god with us we believe that but you know it when he was born he couldn't die for my sins are you listening when he was three years old he couldn't die for my sins when he was 12 talking to the to the lawyers of scribes affairs he couldn't die for my sins even when he started out in his ministry he could not die for my sins at that time because he had not been brought to the place yet but one day he came to a place and he walked into a garden and he said lord he was a human being you know the man outside he said if it's possible let this cup pass from me but he said but nevertheless i do thy will he was yielding himself to the one that was inside of him he said when you do that well don't you talk to the one inside of you brother hans used to say the only time he carried on an intelligent conversation when he was talking to himself that's a thought you don't ever talk to yourself come on i've even said seth come on straighten up you know hey cut that out you know but you see he was submitting himself and when he died on a cross many good men have died i've witnessed that in and they've had it in gainesville just the other day but i witnessed that on good friday in in the philippines when a man has been on the cross 14 years in a row there and they actually put the nails to his hands they were real thin small like this but they actually nailed him to the cross and for 14 or some years his presence i guess still doing it he would they would put him on the cross there's been many a good people died many good stories you could tell in the war days of how that some would just run and jump over the top of a hand grenade or something to try to save their people there's been many many people have died but there's never been but one that said destroy this body and i'll raise it up never been but one could do that so he's got to be that same god that change is not all right then he says go ahead go ahead put me on a cross i could stop the whole time it's what he told uh pilate wouldn't he he said the only power you have is the power that my father gives you you know i could call 12 legions of angels you know but yet he willingly went to that cross and he died to give his life to you and i could have eternal life see then to me that was the proof of his messiahship because we know the messiah in the bible is promised right pronounced through the old testament you know that a virgin shall conceive bring forth a son it was promised right all right but you see he had to be more than just say a body he had to prove his messiahship he said well the dead was raised the sick was healed all okay yeah that's right and we believe the same god still does the same today but when he hung on that tree he knew that he had the ability to walk off of there his life's statement was what john behold your mother in other words take her take care of her you know talking about his mother fleshly speaking because it wouldn't we know she wasn't his mother he always called her woman because she was only an incubator we're in the day when they've got test tube babies and things you know that they they can take an egg out of this one and a sperm out of this one put them together in a tube and put them into this one and i'm going to relate it even as far as where it looks but you can have a child but you see church all that's well and good to talk about a baby and talk about a savior and talk about a person who could do all the things he could do in his life but when he went to that cross that to me is the greatest proof that he was the jehovah the old that he changed not what about knowing in your life what about knowing he knew in his life that he was going to have to die on a tree he knew the horrible things he was gonna have to go through he knew it wouldn't that be like sitting on death row for about five years and then going through all the police of court you know i'd rather go ahead and pull the switch because it bothered me the whole five years and you know but listen he proved who he was when he raised all right when he raised from the dead he proved who he was that's right because he said you destroy this body i'll raise it up he proved that he was the unchangeable god amen when you see church we have the opportunity to be proof of his resurrection right if hebrews 13 is right 13 8 is right then we have the opportunity today to prove that his resurrection did take place you know how because we can just doubt ourselves and come let him come and live and then we can show the world the god we believe it's all right to argue doctrines right but arguing doctrines has never settled anything right right but when you come to the basis you say listen he made the statement in his resurrection he said i go to my father and your father he didn't have any problems relating the believer to his family because that's what he come for and he said i go to my god and your god you know we have the same father you know we have the same god then he hasn't changed right see i i know we're dna human beings and i know everybody's different and they can run that back and chase you all the way back to the garden with their dna abilities but you know i believe every born-again believer has the same dna i didn't get a blood transfusion as we sing that song through my blood runs this and you know and all that no that's just songs there's there's no such thing i didn't get a blood transfusion today i got born again i got a god to come and live in my soul to make my soul eternal to give me eternal life and all he expects out of me is just i don't have to do anything that's what everybody thinks they think you got to give up so much to be a christian what do you got to give up drugs alcohol smoking carousings when you know that's a bunch of garbage to start with it may look like sin in beautiful for a time but the next morning you got a headache guys used to when we were kids growing up you know they say man i got so drunk yesterday i didn't even know what i'd done i said you're a stupid idiot i didn't care i said i know what i'd done yesterday see if all that stuff ought to be what is it but to even be even to be saved from that which is a good thing alcoholics anonymous is a great group but they can't get you born again right but you see if that same life that he said the life paul said that i now live in the flesh i live by the faith of the son of god you know the way that i know that god doesn't change now we read and we see on the side of roads you know god's not dead because i talked to him this morning people talk to totem poles right people talk to totem poles they claim totem poles fall talk back because they hear voices or something is that the only way you can say that god lives is because you talk to him this morning well that's good but that's not all to me you see if that same god ain't living in you then the resurrection don't mean anything to you it doesn't mean a thing but if i can say the same god that was there is living in my heart that he's hebrews 13 8. that we were talking about the things the other day and had the testimonies about some of it in this little group of people that you're sitting here looking at we've seen five or six times that the dead has been raised we've seen healings of all forms and signs that we do not credit to ourselves but credit to almighty god right that's right we've seen all forms rain call for and it would come rain took away when the divorce of a person that would say it we've seen god live that's why i believe hebrews 13 8 to be right that's why i believe he doesn't change because he's still doing what he was doing back there now i'm not going to serve a god that can't help me come on i'll get me a totem pole and i'll rub it a while right it'll be no different and if it's just because i talked to him no i want him to talk back well brother dale have you ever heard audible voices no but i've sure heard a lot of inward voices and a lot of times he had to tell me why don't you straighten yourself up right you know you say oh no if i hear the voice of god i know cause it's sweet and humble and oh no you could defuse you're right in the trap of the devil a lot of times god tells you sit down shut up and behave yourself quit acting like a baby and grow up oh no that ain't god that was the devil what kind of god you got your god changed mine didn't change i can still stand here today and say and that god standing back there in that old testament he said i shall have no other gods before me you're not to worship idols you're not to do this thou shalt not commit adultery i shall not lie thou shalt not steal unless you honor i still believe that today but you know what i believe it in a higher order why because that god has come and lived into our hearts and lives the greatest proof of the resurrection is god living in you is there any hard thing to do you know i mean is it a hard thing to serve god you know i mean if it wasn't nothing but just the material things come on musicians if it wasn't nothing but material things look where america is at in my lifetime of 74 years we went from a horse and buggy to astronauts and beyond that in my lifetime when we kids i was the youngest of 13. i had three brothers older well i got a lot of hand-me-downs you know what and a lot of my patches had patches on the patches you know not saying that's wrong we were just poor old country people because that's what we all were we walked to school we worked we'd done everything we could do for ourselves to try to make a living these kids out here i was seven years old playing a mule out in the field all day long because we had to make a living but that was all of america that was all of the south and the things poor we throw off on slaveries and things like that yeah and i don't believe in it i believe we're all human beings and we're right but we never had any racial problems around here we were all just trying to make a living you know what it didn't matter if the neighbor was black white green brown what color he was if he got sick we went and raised his crop we worked but you see during all of that look what god has multiplied in america and it's made us to the point you know until we're rich people until the foreign countries even think that money grows on trees told you about that time in jamaica and that man he said is it true y'all have gold cards you know cards and i said he said this man said y'all had gold cards i you know i talked for a minute and then it hit me i said he's talking about a gold colored card that's you know a credit card i said yeah i've got one but i won't take it out because it wouldn't have it long if i took it out see and uh he said see there they've got gold carts we'll see it's still thought we had gold cards but if nothing else look what god has done for america look what god has done for you and i look where he's brought all of us to gave us the riches of the world that we can enjoy it he's been wonderful to us why wouldn't we want to serve him even for that reason if nothing else why wouldn't we not want to serve god just for the reason of the materialistic world that we live in today but we also know that that materialistic world has taken us to evil brought on every form of evil into our hands and land you see he said i'm god and i changed not amen so if you don't know him as your savior today remember that that you heard a man say one time did he believe that god didn't change and that if i can believe the same way that that first man believed for healing i can be healed if i can believe and do and follow the same that that first man followed i could be saved because these gardening changes we can depend on that can't but let's stand we're going to go downstairs and and we're going to eat together and have a good time fellowshipping together you know today and all and we want everybody to stay and eat with us and just do and we'll we'll ask the
