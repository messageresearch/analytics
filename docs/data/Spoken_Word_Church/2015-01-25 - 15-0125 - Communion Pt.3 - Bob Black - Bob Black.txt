========================================

so make sure this is working good morning good okay we go so let me just background for everybody that would have been missing and we got this nice little picture up here that I swap internet to kind of illustrate what we've been talking about the last couple of Sunday school lessons is communion and communion is is uh I'm I'm taking a different track than than the Lord's Supper because the Lord's Supper is is what we take in remembrance of our communion with the Lord is is you take it if you're in communion with the Lord but real communion is fellowship with him and and communion is what brother Wade has been talking about for the last year and a half is the statue of a perfect man and which ties together so many other other doctrines and that that brother brand brought to us that real commun sister Johnny God bless you Brother Lou asking you shall receive yeah it's good to good to see we're getting a full house back here wonderful but real communion is is bringing us back into fellowship with God because we uh in the Garden of Eden uh Adam and Eve took one word off and and that got them out of fellowship with the Lord so that they could not walk together and and you know uh communion is is uh is there's so many different things that go into communion communion is to know God's will communion is to be able to walk with the Lord think about all the scriptures and the little stories through the Old Testament and and even in brother R's life about walking with the Lord how how uh that story I told last time about how brother brand started his journey by writing a little message to the Lord in the woods I know you come I know you come by here I want to talk to you and then fast forward a few a few decades maybe and and one day brother Ram's up in the on the top of a mountain and comes the storm and the Lord comes down and says walk with me and he said it'll be the greatest privilege I have to walk with you and go back into the in the Genesis one after Abraham had completed his his little journey and and God says walk before me and be thou perfect and and uh and and Peter come walk with me on the water and and and and one that's really crucial is one that walked with God and was not found he walked with God and after he had made a monument to what brother Wade had been speaking on on the Statue of perfect man a monument to his Revelation that God had given him real communion and after he had that communion with God that he was able to walk with him then in he took a body change now uh and kind of the the the key point of what I've been talking about is in this this uh this quote that I've been reading from what was the Holy Ghost given for in 1959 where brother Brown says God poured himself into Christ correct Christ poured himself into the church therefore now watch at that day you will know that I am in the father and you are in me and I am in you at that day you'll know it for it's the whole thing is one Plan of Redemption coming down that God coming back to live in and dwell in and dwell with and commune to his people as he did at the beginning now now here's the here's the culmination then as soon as he gets his church in speaking conditions and you to get it to when you're in speaking conditions you know what God's will is you know what he wants you know who you are and you know who he is you know you're in communion because you're speaking the same language you're talking the same talk you're walking the same walk you're living the life that he lived you're in communion now then as soon as he gets his church and speaking conditions gets his church to a place that he can flow himself through and love and persuade and fellowship then there come an Eden now remember what brother Way's been bringing out that the stature of perfect man is Go is is is God moving in the church in you to get him to get you in a place where he can have total control total control over your body spirit and soul he'll take his church back to where it left him back in an Eden there where it fell in now now that's where it made its first start of fall that's where it'll take it right back with every with every Clean Slate of redemption so to so the communion to to have communion with God is to walk with God to have communion you you can't have a a real a real Christian relationship with God without communion because that's what the whole point of it is to have a relationship with God you say I'm going to I'm I'm going to go to church but I'm not going to pray I'm not going to have any private time with God I'm not going to I'm not going to spend time reading the Bible alone I'm not going to you're you're forsaken the relationship with God and that's what the whole the gospel is about that's what the ministers are doing is trying to bring the people into a communion with God and not a communion I don't if my goal is to bring you into communion with me then that's that's wrong you see that's what I'm going to be talking about in in a few minutes to know his will in Matthew 7 I'm just going to run through some scriptures real quick Matthew 7:21 Jesus said not everyone that saith unto me Lord Lord shall enter into the kingdom of heaven but he that doeth the will of My Father which is in heaven in Acts 221 13-4 it say brother Saul uh I think this is an brother Saul receive thy sight and the same hour looked upon it and he said the god of our fathers is Paul telling about his conversion the god of our fathers has chosen thee why did he chose Paul choose Paul that thou should us know his will and see that just one and should hear the voice of his mouth in John 4: 23- 24 but the hour cometh and now is when the true worshippers now this this is such a key scripture when Jesus is talking to the woman at the well and there's so many good things you can get out of the the story of the woman of the well how how she was in so steeped in sin but he came he found value in her life he he you know he was her pearl of great price his Pearl his pearl of great price he he saw Val in her and came to tell her about the gospel and and then he's telling her something about when the when the when the when the spirit and the truth are joined together on the day of Pentecost when the Believers have heard the truth and the spirit comes and quickens that then you're going to be able to enter into real communion with the Lord with me you're going to be real real fellowship and that's what he says the hour cometh and now is when the true worship worshippers shall worship the father in spirit and in truth for the father seeketh such to worship him God is a spirit and they that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in truth now that's kind of that's that's lay in the background so let's turn over to Matthew chapter chapter 13 cuz I I know I I cut off in the middle of a thought last Sunday school lesson and I I haven't forgotten about that hey you know I'm I'm going to try to stop saying I'm I'm going in this direction because every time I say that well I end up going in another Direction and uh and you know that's kind of what I I want to talk about is because we' got to real communion with the Lord is where that when the spirit begins to lead you and that's how the church the True Church of God is supposed to be a spirit-led church not just where um not just where brother Dale was only one Le the spirit but where every member individually that on the day of Pentecost that that great Pillar of Fire broke itself out and became little licks of fire on every individual member so it wasn't just the it's it's not big eyes and it's not where only the ministers have fellowship with God that's right and communion but it's where every individual has communion with God every individual with Spirit Le and has a personal revelation of the scripture amen so let's see Matthew Chapter 13 and we're going to start at verse 10 but but look at the first of this the first of this uh chapter is where he begins to talk about the parable of the S went forth the so um this the seed of the word is swn in the different kinds of Hearts it's on into some that will hold it and let it grow and some that are Stony and and and and we know that Parable all the all the different teachings of that but then we come down to verse 10 and it's important to kind of keep the context of these little Parables because when you when you kind of are grasping it what does this really mean well read around a little bit and you can get the get the get the the meaning of what it what it's trying to say and the disciples came and and said unto him now this is kind of what I've been getting at is real communion with God see Jesus go and teach a parable to the to the people at large and then the disciples maybe not fully understand their own self would take Jesus in private and say tell us open this up to me so that I can understand it well that's the same way you got to do you come to church and you hear the preaching over the pulpit that maybe you don't understand I I don't I don't know what he's talking about just the same way that they did when Jesus was preaching I don't know what he's talking about and they went in private and got along with Jesus and Jesus opened it up to them and plainly showed them and that's the same way he'll do when you get uh when you get in communion with God you take it back to your your your prayer closet or your little uh room where you you search the scriptures like the uh the ones in Acts uh whose Name Escapes me uh that that search the Scriptures Daily to prove what was in them whether they were right or not take take it back to your private place and and God will open it up to you cuz the communion is is fellowship with God it's it's a relationship with God it's not somebody um uh we're not just in school or something we're we're the the point of this is to be in communion with God he answered and said unto them in verse 10 and the disciples came and said unto him why speakest thou unto them in Parables he answered and said unto them because it is given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven but to them it is not given why was it not given he just taught the parable of the seed sew in the sea there's different kinds of Hearts some people will receive it some will say and I I was listening to a sermon where brother rown was saying why can is it that that that a Ministry can preach for years and years on dress and clothes and different kinds of things and all the things of the scriptures and some people will just sit out out there and and it it's just like it it's falling on Stony ground it doesn't there's no effect made there's no change made and there's different kinds of hearts that it falls into it's it's your desire it's based on your desire do you want it enough do you do you want to have communion do you want it bad enough to do like brother brandom did and go into the woods God whatever it takes I'm going to write a letter I only know how to approach it right but something's something's got to give and that's that's really the basis of communion is is whatever it takes whatever it takes to stay with God's word that's that's where Adam and Eve messed up is they uh they they failed to do to just to lay aside everything else of the world all all the ideas contrary to that they failed to laid aside and stay absolutely with God's word because it is given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven but to them it is not given for whosoever hath to him shall be given and he shall have more abundance but whosoever hath not from him shall be taken away even that he hath therefore speak out to them in Parables because they seeing see not and hearing they hear not neither do they understand now that's a Str strange thing whosoever ha not for him shall be taken away but if you got you'll get more now now what has brother way been talking about first be born again and once you're born again you'll get more right but if you're not born again if all you have is knowledge then that's going to be taken away from you now let's go over to Matthew 21 I was just reading of that thinking of thinking of Nicodemus coming and and and going so far you know Jesus taught all the The Parables of the talents you know that the different the men will be given different amounts of talents and one took his talent and hid it away I'm I'm not going to do nothing with it now now you know you think about we're in a place where the the message has been laid out so plain for us all the means of Grace into the entrance of the Kingdom of Heaven have been laid out so plain and for us to not take it to take it and just like pull on shelf somewhere and say I'm not I'm not I'm just going to keep it over there and and not really do anything with it God don't want God wants you to put it into action God wants you to to not like Nicodemus or um some of the others in in the Bible that failed to go on right but it's a continual moving you know brother Way's been bringing out I keep quoting brother way because he's been bringing out some good stuff that uh you can't if if if you just if you just stop and don't go on from justification then there's something wrong is if you're just a justification for two or three years then then there's a problem or or 10 years let's say to make it even more dramatic that you got to keep you got to keep moving on don't just hoard up your your uh your knowledge your teaching you and we've got have have been given so much especially at this church you know where it's been it's been laid out we have no excuse to say well well I just I just don't understand it so I'm just going to put it up on the shelf and we should do everything we can that's right to stay with God's word and and and and get in communion with him and um uh through stammering lips and other tongue y'all forgive me I'm stammering a little bit but so Matthew 21 let's that's where we're going Matthew 21: 42 and 43 ah yeah let's say let's start um let's start at verse 41 they say unto him he he will miserably destroy those wicked men let's end in that last Parable then verse 42 Jesus saith unto them did you never read in the scriptures the stone which the builders rejected the same has become the head of the corner this is the Lord's doing and it is marvelous in our eyes therefore say I unto you the kingdom of God shall be taken from you and given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof and whosoever shall fall on this Stone shall be broken but on whomsoever it shall fall it will grind him to power now I got 15 minutes to get into something so uh what I what I was thinking on it now you know we know where the Cornerstone is and The Headstone or brother way is going to be teaching on that in a little bit really what what The Headstone is but we know that the Cornerstone of faith that you're born again at Faith and adopted you know brother W has explained all that but now now think about this now that stone that came out of the mountain destroyed everything that was set up well let's go let's go back I I'm going to go back to Genesis chapter 9 where this image that's destroyed first starts being set up really this babylonish image it kind of change the way change change the the tone a little bit and in Genesis chapter 9 verse one and God blessed Noah and his sons and said unto them be fruitful and multiply and replenish the Earth he tells them he gives them a mandate to multiply and replenish the whole earth they just go out into the whole world and now and and then skip over to Genesis verse 10 uh chapter 10 verse 10 verse 9 and 10 we've got somebody coming on the scene named uh Two Fellas Kush and Nimrod let's start at verse 8 chapter 10 verse 8 and Kush begat Nimrod he began to be a mighty one in the earth he was a mighty Hunter before the Lord wherefore it is said even as nimra the mighty Hunter before the Lord and the beginning of his kingdom was Bible and Eric and aad and K in the land of Shar out of that land went forth Asher and build in Nineveh and the city reoboth and kala so we got two fellas named Kush and Nimrod they started something back there when when uh I got into reading hops 2 babblin and and uh you know a lot of hops 2 babblin is quoted in the churches book and and um the his too batt and talks about who who Kush really was and it's there's a lot of many many proofs and a lot of citations and things in that book but to to make a long story short kosha goes by the name of baale who baale means Bel L not b a a l but Bel means the confounder say and and B Kush set himself up as the uh is The Interpreter of the Gods what he what he wanted to do was say well uh you know the the whole land the whole earth was after the flood was kind of in one Accord uh maybe as as close to communion as you could get they they believed in one God they they believed in you know they uh they were they were moving along right in the right direction and then Kush Rises up and says I'll tell you what God really wants to do and he wants to he wants to set up he wants to record we want to record our knowledge and and build this he built this uh he started the move to build the city of Nineveh and the Tower of Babel which his son carried on Nimrod uh who who uh goes by another name uh that uh I've got written down somewhere but I'll get to that in a minute so The Interpreter the The Interpreter of the Gods starts uh he he starts what he's doing is trying to get people out of communion with God and bring them into communion with him so now you can see that that move in the church today is it instead of being a Spirit-filled people he was trying to get them into more politics and humanism where they were you know church will always go off course if you get to where you you put in a pastor or uh uh deacons or whatever because of who is the most popular and who is the most friendly who is the nicest and the sweetest and who Rubes your your further right way because a lot of times you you is edifying the most edifying and the most needful to be sometimes to be delivered the word in in a scalding way you know in a way that burns your high a little bit may you send you home uh thinking about things because uh that what the the purpose of the purpose of the ministry is is to build up an a stature of of a perfect man to build up a church in God's image to bring Us in the communion and sometimes the best way to do that is not with with maybe uh uh slick talking and and a nice haircuts and things and and kissing babies and and doing everything just the way it seems for us to do but a real spirit filled church will will be led completely of the Lord and and and and and that's that's kind of what I'm getting at is that Nimrod you can see that Spirit everything that started in Genesis just carried on right all the way to Revelations you can see it all the way to Revelations is that and and and many churches today you know it's it it's just frightful when you go even to message churches sometimes and see like little Thrones set up and things like where where somebody in high Authority sits and then you got lesser people and then lesser people under that and then then then we're going to put the lady off like like they're nothing and that's that's exactly what Nimrod and Kush were trying to do was trying to separate the people from the ministry in such a way that the ministry is is some great people and and the L is nothing at all right Lord Jesus said that's why he had washing feet the ministry is actually uh really L because you know everybody's it's like waiting tables you're sitting down and and and I'm serving you that's right bringing you food and and it's actually the opposite the way the way many people think it it's not um I remember years ago I heard a little somebody uh was was staying with um uh some a couple of ministers while they traveled and he said he told me man they just all they do is read the Bible they're just it's like they're they they're laboring and and and really that's that's what it's about it's it's laboring to try to get and we get all motion excuse me trying to get people into God's image amen so because uh now now now how do you I'm not really trying to talk about Ministry so much but but now how do you remember we were talking about conversation one of the previous Sunday school lessons what is your conversation and we look at the word conversation cuz conversation you can't have real communion without a conversation the conversation is is uh uh in the Old Testament the old the Old Testament Hebrew word and the and the Greek word for conversation one of the one of the big meanings of that if you look at the strong concordance is is it your it's your way of life and and the Bible uses conversation a lot of times to mean the the of your life and now I ask really uh how do you tell if if the ministry is is not a nimrod it Nimrod and Kush were set up to they just had their own ideas and they and their message was it doesn't matter what God's word says but uh let's just do what feels right and and opposed to the real Ministry who uh the evidence of the real Ministry is in Hebrews 13:7 which we we like to quote Hebrews 13:8 but Hebrews 13:7 says remember them which have the rule over you cuz you know God does put by the spirit put people over you to see you into the Kingdom of Heaven to move you into the communion with God remember them which have the rule over you who have spoken unto you the word of God whose Faith follow considering the end of their conversation now that moves right on into Hebrews 13:8 because the end of your conversation has to be Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever but that's not just words right your conversation is your life that's right because it does not matter you know really Ministry is is just there's like an hour behind the pulpit but Ministry really starts when you step off the pulpit because nobody really it doesn't really matter what you say right it matters like a thousand times more what you live cuz you can I I can see that just looking around it's ministers that that don't live the life or or say things that cause people to question Christianity that has more of an effect than anything you could say that's right cuz people are looking at the life and that's what brother Wade has been talking about this is a life it's the a The Life of Christ brotherly kindness godliness patience Temperance how can you have those things unless you are growing in Grace and knowledge with God unless you're growing into a perfect commun with him that's right it's God's life in you that's right and that's what excuse me he's here right now amen the life is what caused Paul to be converted it wasn't so much the pillar of fire but he saw the life of God in stepen yeah yes right when he said no man by knowledge can say father forgive them hold not these things to their charge it had to be God in flesh amen and and that's why this cannot be impersonated you can't impersonate the life made manifest now we we we come to church and we hear we hear the truth and we hear that we all these talents and things have been given to us like at The Parables all these different things have been given to us so that we can grow and come into the perfect knowledge the perfect Faith a perfect stature of Christ and perfect communion and I'm going to stop right there I didn't even get halfway I didn't even get to my slides
