rain and uh we're getting ready to come leave the house and brother joe i saw a text message from brother joe there was an accident on 95. um he said possibly there could have been a fatality there so you remember that family or whoever was in that accident um but so we had to take a different route get on 85 get on exit 40 come come down pass by your house by the way [Laughter] and uh to get here so to avoid that but we thank god for bringing us again on this wednesday night um so we're gonna go ahead and just go to the lord in prayer and uh um and let's just by our heads our heavenly father we thank you lord once again for the opportunity that we have lord to meditate upon your word lord father god we don't want to take that lightly lord jesus because it's your word father and that same word lord created father god the heavens and the earth lord jesus that same word heavenly father creates the animals lord that we see all around us and that same creative word father is creating and shaping us father in this hour lord father god through your holy spirit and we just thank you for that we ask you lord that you would just have your way here tonight lord forgive us for all of our sins and iniquities cleanse us lord if if there's anything father that we may have done or said or even thought about lord that was contrary to your word lord we pray father that it be placed under the blood lord that it would not hinder us from receiving father from your word and let his father lay aside all the weights and the sins that would so easily beset us lord and help us father god to be able to run this race of patience granted lord jesus meet every need amongst us father and bless those that might steal on their way we comma commit this time into your hands i i yield my my members to you lord have your way here this evening in jesus christ's name amen amen praise the lord jesus let's turn to philippians chapter four philippians chapter four i know we we i wanted to continue on this thought on this thought on think on these things this is part three of think on these things and i just want to say beforehand before we read i i i may touch on a subject tonight that that it might it might be a little might be a little bit uncomfortable to touch but i think it's needful to be to be touched upon and so um you just pray for us and uh and just let the lord have his way amen and that that we would just say things you know that that it would it would it would uh it would uplift us and they would it would help us because i you know when i think when i when when i when i think about this this topic i'm mostly thinking about our young people and and of course it affects us all right but i think about our young people a lot because they are constantly bombarded with thoughts even more now than than ever than we have ever faced because let me tell you us older ones you know we had one line of thinking only one source was maybe bombarding us but now they have multiple sources bombarding them from every angle from every angle and so now it's it's a whole soup of different things that they have to deal with that we didn't have to deal with when when when you know when we were growing up so um so i think it's important to to to touch upon these things so uh in philippians chapter 4 verse 4 we'll read the scripture and and then you may be seated it says rejoice in the lord alway and again i say rejoice that is a commandment rejoice let your moderation be known unto all men the lord is at hand be careful for nothing now that doesn't mean you know don't take care of yourself or don't be careful it means don't worry be careful don't worry about anything but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto god amen god remember what we were talking about the other day god wants you to approach him with your requests amen he wants you to approach the throne what with boldness right and the peace of god which passeth all understanding shall keep your hearts watch and minds through christ jesus and then he says continues to say and this is i love this scripture verse 8 finally brethren he's talking to brothers now all right brothers and sisters whatsoever things are true whatsoever things are honest how many like to to hear truth how how many like to to have people tell you false things i'm the only one reason how many how many like it when people are honest with you all right well this is what paul is telling us that whatsoever things are true whatsoever things are honest whatsoever things are just whatsoever things are pure how many love pure things whatsoever things are lovely i love lovely things or you do too whatsoever things are of good report in other words whatsoever things have a good testimony right if there be any virtue if the union of anything has virtue or if there is anything that that is worthy of praise think on these things all right and that's a commandment from paul he says think on these things these things which you have both learned and received and heard and seen in me do and the god of peace shall be with you you may be seated this afternoon praise the lord jesus amen as i said before you know this scripture has has helped me out in the in the last two three years you know i've really tried to put my my my concentration on this on the scripture more than i have in the past because um i i think it's needful i think i think in the last two or three years we've been bombarded with all kinds of information from left and right all kinds of propaganda from left and right and all kinds of things that that that have uh that have come to manipulate the the the behaviors of people people are not acting the way they acted three years ago uh people are walking now in fear people are now walking in in in it you know leery of one another now you know and and what's this guy you know what you know and worse than that they you were put behind masks and things like that which makes you look like you know you're even more leader you look like a criminal well criminals are the ones that wear masks because they don't want to be seen you know they don't want to be seen the fruits of darkness that they're in so that is the society that we live in now in this day but you see as christians and as and as the people of god we have been freed amen we are free people we we we are free by the holy spirit how many can say you've been freed by the holy spirit the word frees you in this hour amen and the word the word frees your your your thinking in this hour you don't have to think like the world amen you don't have to think what like what they're trying to feed you you don't have to think that way praise the lord jesus you can think the thoughts of god and the thoughts of god are holy pure amen true and just and righteous and will and will uh cause you to behave certain ways you know you you walk down the street or or you're driving down the road and and and and you see the you see people right and the way they they talk the way they they walk the way they they look it tells you what information or what things they think about and what jesus said himself whatsoever you think amen whatever is in a man's heart that is what's going to come out of the pan of the person you see amen praise the lord now in romans chapter 12 we read this as well and uh and i'm just kind of reviewing it a little bit and then we'll get to the to the part three part here and he says in romans chapter 12 he says i beseech you therefore brethren by the mercies of god that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice now he says for you to do it he doesn't say that god will present your bodies no he wants you to do it yourself so there's something for you to do in this hour there's a dying out for you to do in this hour that's the reason why bro brother wade and brother dale we've been they've been preaching for years in regards to the stature of perfect man amen that's for you to die out to this to this flesh to this spirit man praise god because these things aren't born again your soul is born again praise the lord your soul is sitting in heavenly places in christ jesus amen you are your soul is redeemed amen but this body still you still have to work on it right amen how many have how many how many can say that every thought that you've had this week until now has been good thoughts nobody can therefore that means that you still have to work on yourself right i can't say the same thing either right we all still working and that's the reason why we are still feeding on this on this word that's helping us now i want you to keep in mind that you can you can understand the stature of a perfect man intellectually but if you don't let those attributes of those things come out amen then it's not anything it's just knowledge and knowledge puffeth up but we want to see knowledge being performed we want to see knowledge amen pass from just being knowledge and and and thoughts to doing amen we want we want to be not just hearers of word but we want to be doers of the word praise god when god spakes his word amen he's it's a thought expressed and it has a man it has those are capsules or containers right of of of his word and those things go out and they're there they got they got a mission they're going to do something they're going to cause some sort of change they're going to they're going to they're going to create something god doesn't speak anything just to speak it he did not create anything that you see created just because it's been created oh they say oh you don't need your appendix god created it it's there for a reason or whatever that part is is it the appendix it's there for a reason god has a purpose for everything that he does amen praise god so paul says here he he wants you to present your body as a living sacrifice you present it holy acceptable unto god which is your reasonable service and he says here in verse 2 and be not conformed to this world in other words don't be molded into this world you see we come into this world and this world has has a mold uh you know a different you know how for example on an ice tray right those are molds where you can place water and the water when you put it in the freezer it freezes up and it and it it forms into whatever the water was in and that shape and so when you take out the ice if it's supposed to be round ice you don't expect it to come out in squares or in cubes right you expect it to come out round because it got molded to what it was and so that's what is paul is trying to say don't mold yourself or don't conform yourself to this world you see the world has all kinds of molds you can look you can look and act and and and talk like anything you just pick you want to look like a rock star you they got it you want to look like somebody you know them anime characters and all that kind of stuff them koreans you know with all the all the the the different uh attire that they wear you can look just like one you wanna you wanna look like a hip-hop rapper you certainly can look like one they're all moles but amen the christian wants to look like christ amen this is the mold that we want to look like amen praise god amen but you have a choice you can pick whatever mold you and look just like that but he says here but be ye transformed so instead of looking conforming yourself to the world instead be ye transformed by the renewing of what he didn't say by the renewing of your soul he didn't say by the renewing of anything else he said by the renewing of your mind because your soul is born again but your body and your spirit is not therefore that's the part that you need to work on that's the part that you still need to be transformed by the renewing of your mind and i and it's interesting that paul uses that word transformed how many know how many have seen when i was younger in the 1980s i watched the cartoon called the transformers brother joe knows about it brother aaron all of them and then later on in the 2000s they made movies with them and so the transformers they were these robots that that supposedly you know there were to be they walked like humans they and they they talked they talked they had robotic voices but they talked and but then all of a sudden when it was time for them to get into war or or or battle or something they they'd form and transform into a car a helicopter or a plane completely different from the original form that they were amen and that's what paul is trying to tell us here amen he's trying to tell us amen that you don't need to be the way you came to this earth amen you can be transformed you can be different by what by the renewing of your mind praise god so how many believe that we need mind renewal amen we all need it i need it because you just told me that you all not all your thoughts were pure thoughts this week therefore we all need that mind renewal all right i like the way that the new living version says it says don't copy the behavior and customs of this world yeah it says but let god transform you into a new person by changing the way you think you see the only way that you will change is by changing the way you think about things right if you see god in a certain way or if you think about god in a certain way that's the way you're that's the way you're gonna head if you're very loose in your life about about serving god that's the way you're gonna act but if you're very tight you know some of us can be overly tight right then that's how you're gonna you're gonna approach god that's the way you're going to look god all right so we were talking about in the last two parts we were talking about that that you know thoughts thoughts how uh thoughts are very important thoughts uh are are we we don't put as much attention on thoughts like the way we should and in reality when you read the word of god when you look at the word of god these are god's thoughts in book form you believe that every single thing that you read here is a thought capsule from god for you and so when you're looking in the in the mirror of the word amen when you stand in the mirror in the mirror every day and you look at yourself you you you're looking at yourself and you're you're you're you're coming to a conclusion about the person that you see in the mirror right i'm too fat oh i gotta lose some weight you know where uh man i don't know what's up what is this that i got down here i got these bags under my skin now under my eyes and i got it i got to do something about that you see we all come to all kinds of conclusions amen but the christian amen when he looks in the word he's supposed to see christ right you're supposed to see and then and then when you look in the word amen and you read what how it's supposed to be or how christ acted amen that that puts in you hey i want to be just like that right in the mirror of the word amen so the word of god transforms our thoughts praise the lord jesus the problem is is that we don't get in the word much that's the problem we don't we don't get in the word much in order for the word to transform the way we think amen amen praise god so we we talked about how uh you know thoughts relate to words and and words they're they're they're highly important how many believe that words are highly important praise god what you'd say or or don't say amen is is very important and a word we know brother brown told us that a word is a thought expressed or or a thought capsule or thought containers amen praise god brother branham tells us he says here you know sunday how we got into it that when god speaks it has to be so there's no way at all to get away from it god says let there be and it has to be the very word itself and the word was a thought right and the word was a thought god when he before a word is an expression of a thought that's why when you're talking to somebody and you're like you know what why'd she say that sometimes you know people show what they're thinking about about what they expressed through their mouths right oh no no i don't think that way but why did you say it then it means it was in your thoughts right because we don't all just just speak just to say things you know we don't just at least you shouldn't right just just blurt out whatever you know brother boyd's talking to me about car cars and i start talking to them about helicopters you know i'm not you know or just whatever you know or just some random thing amen but but but you see that's that's not how we're supposed to approach things amen whatever you thinking amen that's what you're going to express that's what that's what god's thoughts are a word is an expression of a thought god thought in his mind spoke it into existence all right and then here's an example that he gives we read this now if the blood of bulls and goats could give a power to moses to go out there by the commission of god and stretch forth that rod and say let there come flies he had the word of god and he spoke that word and when he did it it become and when he did it become from god's thought a word is a thought expressed right and so then when god thought it and put it in moses's mind and he spoke it it become a word right because god moses couldn't speak anything unless god put it in his mind first to speak it right and i like this part it says and moses turned around and went back maybe not a fly in the country in an hour from then maybe one old green fly began to buzz around in a half hour there was 10 pounds per square yard what was it the creative word of god that was spoke by the lips of a mortal man amen and that is the exact same thing that god wants to do with you he loves it what's the reason why he loves his word and your lips amen and when you confess his word because his word has created power you can change the atmosphere with words about what you say or don't say you can change an atmosphere with silence too amen sometimes we need to practice that more often some of us but words change atmospheres right just as god changes things and creates things when his word goes forth amen you believe that praise the lord jesus how many love the lord amen all right all right let me just skip skip all this here and let's continue here and um and then we talked about examples of bad thoughts turning into action you know amnon raping his own half-sister and when you read it in the life of david how did that happen did amna just wake up one morning and said i'm just gonna rape my sister no it started as a thought that was pr that that that was produced and it was he was just still thinking about it and we couldn't go couldn't let go of it until it finally it came to fruition you see that's how satan came to to to eve the serpent came to eve amen and it was introducing his thoughts to her he didn't you know he didn't tell her come on and just let let's lay with each other no he just he started introducing thoughts all right you know he started introducing little things like while brother burley says that he took her to the chat room yeah and started started just chatting with her just just just talking things you know amen and from there we see the whole thing what happened right it's all starts in little chats that's why young people we need to be careful amen we need to guard ourselves amen about what we how we express ours ourselves uh with each other online you know we we just nowadays is different because uh uh you know i've i've talked with brothers about this back then you know you wanted to talk to a girl you either called her or you wrote her right you wrote her or a letter or you called if you knew the phone number and it would not ring a cell phone it would ring the house phone that means that mom or dad or a sister or brother or somebody or grandma in the house would might be a possibility to just pick up the phone and if they had caller id they didn't know what it who it was but they were going to pick the phone right and then you had to say is is susie there who is this not oh oh it's john uh you know or whoever i'm not saying you know from from school oh okay all right and now the the father could start maybe so how did y'all meet you know or how do you know my daughter you know but nowadays it ain't like that young people got phones and they get to chatting on there it bypasses the the father bypasses the mother bypasses the sister the grandmother they don't know what's going on that's why it's your responsibility as parents to watch those things in your house because you your young people your children ain't going to tell you dang they ain't going to tell you and so it's up to you to guard things like that amen and of course judas is selling jesus out that was another thought that he had that started as a thought and it came into be we know that that had to happen but amen so what is a thought and then the definition of a thought is a something that is a thought such as an individual act or a product of thinking and then it says a developed intention or plan a developed intention or a plan now remember god's word is god's thoughts right that he has an intention or plan with that word and it's to create amen whether it's a physical something physical or whether it's something spiritual in you and me but it's gone it's not gonna go void it's not it's not gonna return to him void it's gonna create and it's gonna do exactly what he said his word to do amen praise the lord that's why sometimes you know we think that that maybe we we didn't we didn't make an effect on someone when we're talking to someone or or even sometimes as preachers you know they're like man that people didn't hear nothing man they just slept the whole time but you sometimes we just think we don't know that maybe a year down the road i remember brother louise talking about that i remember that and then they put two and two together because somebody else gave the extra element to it another preacher or somebody said something and then there it goes amen so so it's almost it's it's hard sometimes but we gotta trust god that god's word doesn't return void amen god's word will not return void so the word that your children heard amen the word that that your family member heard and if they're not here amen that word won't return void and you but you got to believe that you got to stand on that because god's word is god's thoughts and their creative thoughts and then when you put those thoughts in your mind amen then it'll make you a man to be uh connected with that word amen praise god he won't return back void praise the lord jesus it's also reasoning power the power to imagine praise the lord jesus and we talked about how the uh reading in the scripture here let's go back excuse me for just a moment in genesis 6 5 genesis 6 5 says and god saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth and that every every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually can you imagine that everywhere that noah you know noah and his family everywhere where they were at all around them all there was was people with every imagination of the thoughts of their heart was only evil continually that's right amen you know we don't live in a society right now that way but it's getting that way where people just constantly you know they're getting to just want to think about continually evil continue evil all kinds of evil i mean hell is just open up it's opening up in different kinds of ways and there's just evil coming at us you know the bible talks about 200 million demons just unleashed upon the bride and so you better be fortified behind the word of god amen so what noah being in this type of situation and him and his family the only ones that didn't have evil continually thinking in their heart that's the reason why god said that i felt noah found grace in the eyes of god can you imagine that wow and in this day god there's a people that's going to find grace in the eyes of god amen even in the late hour that we live in praise god and you better just think that that that that's you amen that that's you praise god when you look at that word there the imagination of thoughts it relates back to the word is the hebrew word yet sir which means to fashion or to frame or to form or fashion it relates to to when a potter is building a a a a vase or or or something he's fashioned in that thing and that's what the people were thinking about fashioning something evil constantly fashioning something making something evil at all times praise god amen all right so there is a little background there and we we we mentioned a few of some some thoughts from god amen that you can cling on amen jeremiah 17 14 amen it says heal me o lord and i will be healed save me and i will be saved for you are the one i praise you know i'd rather be quoting that amen than quoting some some negative thing when i'm sick you have more of a chance to be healed if you quote that amen because god wants you to not just receive the thought and then speak it and when you speak it it has the same creative effect that it had when it came out of god's mind because that's the reason why we're little creators right right we're little creators but we're not little creators by ourselves we have we're only little creators because we we hold on to the word of god through the word amen praise the lord jeremiah 30 17 says but i will restore you to health and heal your wounds declares the lord exodus 23 25 worship the lord your god and his blessing will be on your food and water i will take away sickness from among you isaiah 53 4-5 surely he took our up our pain and bore our suffering yet we consider him punished by god stricken by him and afflicted but he was pierced for our transgressions he was crushed for our iniquities this is a different version but saying the same thing the punishment that brought us peace was on him and by his wounds we are healed praise the lord jesus those are those are god's thoughts amen those are god's thoughts for you in your hour of need amen cling to these thoughts you know about wayward loved ones romans 12 12 says rejoice in hope be patient in tribulation be constant in prayer amen don't be constant and asking why why lord why me why is this happening to us amen be constant in prayer all right romans 8 28 and we know that for those who love god all things work together for good some people say well that's easy for you to say well i'm saying it because the word of god said amen and if the word of god says it it's got creative power behind it for those who are called according to his purpose proverbs 14 26 in the fear of the lord there is strong confidence and his children will have refuge and then psalm 89 4 thy seed will i establish forever and build up thy throne to all generations amen praise the lord jesus all right so now let's let's start here and uh i don't know if i gave this to the brothers or not but in psalms 92 5 psalms 92 5 he says here david says here oh lord how great are thy works and thy thoughts are very deep amen praise god and thy thoughts are very deep yeah why is david saying mentioning it like this he's putting it that like this is it is it is it that his thought is it that god wants us to have his thoughts that we can't understand no god wants us to understand his thoughts why do you think he gave us his word if he doesn't want us to understand it right he wants us to understand his word praise the lord jesus he wants us to receive the benefits of his creative word his creative thoughts amen praise god but the thing the the thing is is that they're they are deep they're very deep because when you start thinking about just one of god's thoughts just one of god's verse it leads you to a rabbit hole right i mean us as preachers that happens to us we start thinking and looking and breaking down just one verse and it leads us to different avenues and different things amen i'm so thankful for for different resources out there that have you know uh uh you know different different resources that could lead you hey you know you're reading a verse and then you can read a quote that brother brown talked about that verse or vice versa you know just different things like that but you see it can legion you can be on one of god's thoughts for hours and if you really love god and if you really enjoy hearing about god and if you really enjoy his word his thoughts those hours is just nothing for you this is like lord give me more amen praise god give me more so that's what david is saying oh lord how great are thy works and thy thoughts are very deep amen yeah his thoughts are so deep uh and and and and they're they're they're wonderful praise god to us and god gave us the ability to think those same exact thoughts you know the the the animal kingdom doesn't have that ability they don't we are the only species that have the ability to choose what to think right you you can choose what you think well you say well the devil made me think about that no the devil didn't make you don't the devil presented something before you you decide if you want to continue eating on that or thinking on that right as they say you know the bird bill the bird may fly over a man but he doesn't have to build a nest right you just look get the bird out right and the best way to get the the bird out amen is through god's thoughts praise the lord jesus christ amen you're still with me hallelujah amen and so we look at here and when we look at god's thoughts amen you know with regards to understanding the scriptures you know you know we've we've read before we think we think oh my we uh we we read those scriptures and and and we think oh it may not change us right away but you continue chewing on that on that word and you continue taking everything out and and fully getting everything that you can get out from the front from the word of god that's what god wants us to do with his word not just passively look at it praise god praise the lord jesus amen now imagine comprehending the the thought of the word of scripture amen the thought of the thought of god not just not just now but not just now but but but throughout all eternity can you imagine that that same thought in the beginning god created the heaven and the earth that that that that is an eternal thought that you're going to take with you throughout all eternity amen amen the heaven and earth will pass away but god's word will never pass away amen amen so the more we ponder on his thoughts amen the more we we start seeing ourselves in them amen you start seeing yourselves in those thoughts praise god psalm 139 17 says how precious also are thy thoughts unto me o god amen do you feel that god's thoughts are precious to you i hope so amen amen how precious also are thy thoughts unto me o god how great is the sum of them and if i should count them they are more in number than the sand when i awake i am still with thee amen you know satan may have bombarded you with a certain thought may have ruined something in your life but if you just take one of god's thoughts what took satan amen 10 20 years to destroy amen god can change it overnight one of god's thoughts can change it overnight amen what took satan amen 30 years to do amen god can do it with his word overnight and we get surprised about it but we know that it can the problem is is that we don't express and we don't practice amen but we don't believe enough our unbelief causes us it leaves us with our mouth open but you should know better that god can do it praise the lord jesus you know we all have different testimonies and different things of how god has changed situations you know praise god and and such in such uh unimaginative ways of of the way we think about it but god's ways are are his ways amen praise the lord second corinthians chapter 10 let's read here in verse 5 it says he says here casting down imaginations imaginations that means imaginations is is not any something real all right it can be or it cannot be but most of the time it's not most of the time us as human beings we worry about things that probably will not happen and you know when those thoughts start coming to you more when you get down to pray how many have had that you start thinking about things that you did not even think about from when from the time that you woke up thinking about the oil change in the car how it needs to get done you start thinking about how you need to go here and then you need to go to the grocery store and and my daughter got piano lesson on thursday and and that's just monday but you're already thinking about the piano lesson on thursday and god's like all right you know you were here with me for about 10 seconds and now you're just diverting yourself i'm still here you're diverting yourself you're thinking about the washing machine how you it needs to get replaced and you're thinking about you know all kinds of things and how you gonna get home you know uh such and such a day and you know you need to pick such and such a person up or whatever it is lately for me it's been picking people up in the airport and things like that going back and forth and you know and you can't er and it's it's hard for a while because our that's when satan really comes in he wants to block you amen from expressing and praying to god amen praise the lord but he says casting down imaginations casting down casting down is not just just laying them down i'll lay down that imagination you know no he says throwing it down he says throwing it out casting it out hey man you don't just lay down the trash you throw the trash out right you throw it in that in that bin and you hurry up and close the lid because that thing stinks right you cast it down that's what paul's saying here in every high thing watch and every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of god now paul didn't say that god would do this for you he's telling us to do it again it's working in this man right here and you can't do it on yours by yourself that's why you need the holy spirit the holy ghost amen will read this word and we'll say yes lord i received that let me start putting it into action god help me because that's my desire my desire fits your desire of your word your creative word your thought now i want to put it to action that exalted itself against the knowledge of god and bringing into captivity every thought every thought to the obedience of christ to the obedience what is the word christ it means is the word anointing amen to the obedience of the anointing amen we as christians we have an anointing on our life right praise god we gotta if we can just keep our thoughts under that anointing it's hard to do but it can be done because paul says so that we can praise god now in first timothy chapter four going a little bit quicker verse 11 it says these things command and teach let no man despise thy youth i'm speaking here to the youth a little bit here but be thou an example of the believers in word in conversation and charity in spirit in faith impurity till i come give attendance to reading exhortation to doctrine he's telling here timothy paul is telling here timothy a young man this is what you should do till i come you give attendance to reading to exhortation to doctrine and i'm sure he wasn't telling him to read his pinterest account or to read his facebook posts or another or his text messages constantly right or his facebook messenger messages that come in right no i'm sure he's talking about the word right watch neglect not the gift that is in thee i want you to understand young people that god has placed gifts in your life and not and not just young people but older ones here as well maybe it might not be a gift to minister or do something in the church but it's it's for something to help someone else right and that makes you a minister because a minister is one that serves so god has called each and every one of us to serve right amen neglect not the gift that is in thee which was given thee by prophecy with the laying of the hands of the presbytery verse 15 meditate and i watch this meditate upon these things upon what upon giving attendance to reading to exhortation to doctrine and give thyself half-heartedly to them doesn't say that no give thyself holy to them watch that thy propheting may appear to all god wants you to profit god wants you to walk like you're a rich man i mean you may not have a dime in your life amen but if you got the word of god amen you are a rich man you're a rich woman you're a rich young man you're a rich young lady praise god amen and people will see that right i think about i think about that testimony that brother branham gives about about blood about the blind man that he prayed for amen and and and he said he's you know he could have god could have given his sight right there and then when he prayed for the man but the man just kept going and he kept repeating i believe he kept he kept saying that i am healed i am healed i'm healed he went to the barbershop and he declared that to everybody he he everybody was seeing that that's why he had profited from amen he's believing amen and eventually it came to pass even though that he was getting negative walls and things were being placed in front of him eventually it came to pass praise god because he stayed wholeheartedly meditating on those things and giving himself holy to them praise god do you think that if you if if you're not constantly looking at something repeating something reading something meditating on something that you don't become that right now that is in now that is for example in the positive now how much more in the negative way whatever you feed on whatever you look upon whatever you think about on amen eventually you become that because a thought can't just stay spiritual right a thought has to express itself physically a thought has to manifest itself physically praise god so that's the reason why we all all of us and and i i'm not speaking to the young people we we have to watch what we listen to we have to watch what we view praise god because let me tell you things the things of this world the things you view the things you you you listen to they mold your thinking amen to think a certain way and to express yourself in a certain way amen do you believe that yes amen amen i can say that for myself my testimony i was an mtv junkie when i came to the united states my mom and dad they had cable of course you know everybody that came to the states back then you think that you needed to have cable and get in debt because that's what that's what you know the people in the third world countries think that here in america you know that's what it's all about you know you make money yeah you make money but but then but then they start getting in debt and you know and now that's just part of life so we had mtv in the house and i was just feeding on that mtv all day long well maybe you might not know what mtv is music television i watched videos and all kinds and whatever i watched whatever those things the music that i'd listened to amen i i wanted to copy those styles amen if if amzie hammer was doing the running man on on television you asked my mom and dad i was there right there in front of the tv doing doing the the running man [Laughter] if you know the name of different artists you know if if axel rose was doing this you know i was right there doing that right and eventually amen that starts hindering you in your life praise god amen so so the music you listen to and and the things you watch amen those things will mold you music that you listen to or fashions that you follow amen they will shape the way you look and feel oh no no i only have those on my pinterest account they're only just pins on my pinterest account then why are you copying them huh praise god all kinds of different things you know here's the problem young people today and you know maybe us during our time we do things and we don't think about where those things come from or in other words the spirit of behind them see we start dressing certain ways or we start looking or talking or saying things certain ways and you don't realize that you know you don't you don't look at where did that come from where is the influence of that from because everything has a certain origin everything has an origin it just didn't just come out out of thin air it comes from someone's thought and there therefore however you you you you dress or however you you talk or however you conduct yourself that is you expressing that person's thought and in reality it's not you expressing your own thoughts it's it's you expressing somebody else's thoughts now i i you know that because because you know yeah i get it you want to you want to look cool and you want to be you know into style or whatever but amen do you want to express your own way or do you want to express somebody else's thoughts because somebody else is somebody else thought of that first let's take a look and see where did that come from where did that come from where did that thought come from can i take it back to the word of god you know from genesis to revelation you know that that that that style or or or that music that i'm listening to can can i see it in the word of god right then it'll help you to choose the things that will mold your thoughts in a spiritual way right praise god praise the lord jesus and you know is it's whatever whatever you whatever you have you know and you say always just pins you know for those who know what pinterest is you know it's just my pins you know i'm not gonna meditate i'm not gonna i'm not gonna act like that but amen there's something in you that would desire that otherwise you wouldn't have pinned it right you pinned it means like you bookmark it you know like you bookmark it maybe i can't do that right now but maybe in the future that's the things get born again and you don't have to look like the world you don't have to be like the world praise god amen i ask you this if jesus was looking through your pinterest account what would he or she think if jesus was looking through your instagram account what would he or she think oh i'm sorry he what would he think would you be confident to show jesus your your your pinterest account lord look this is what i've been saving you know i've been saving all these quotes and these different you know or whatever you know maybe something else you know or would you be ashamed to show him would you be ashamed i want you to think about that young people amen can you freely show somebody here at church what you look at i'm not saying that any none of us i don't it's between you and god but can you freely say i can show you what i look at or can't or you can't you know the videos that you watch or even the people that you follow would you be ashamed if brother dale came to your house and saw the youtube video on your on your tv screen and it wasn't anything godly all right more than brother dale jesus what would jesus think oh we'll be hurrying up changing that station the evening night evening evening like tabernacles today you know spoken word church youtube channel hurry up brother dale's coming right and i just say not just this for young people but also us adults hey we all carry these devices god knows what you have on your device that's between you and god and us as parents you know we we give freedom to our to our kids and they get to a certain age that's between them and god right but young people i want you to understand that those things mold your thinking amen they mold your thinking all right just real quick i just want to i just want to hit this hit this real quick i want to talk about pornography for just a moment amen become very prevalent let me just read you something here real quick you know this might have been a taboo subject to talk about 15 years ago it it shouldn't be anymore because it it is it's become a problem it's become a problem not just for young people but also for adults as well this is just from may it is estimated that 40 million americans watch pornography regularly and and and that 35 of all internet downloads are related to pornography while some limit pornography to only movies or videos we would like to suggest that it also includes books pictures stories and other media also audios as well displaying sexual content used to incite arousal it's not you you look at a pornography site don't make you want to pray it it's what it's inciting is arousal to do something that you you shouldn't you shouldn't be doing you know or to go out and do something that you shouldn't do until you get married sexual behavior in other words porn has become a widespread phenomenon among young and adult populations as it is accessible through all screens through all screens although more accepted in today's culture pornography has led our society to over sexualization and gender of objectification what does that mean in other words men now don't look at women the same way we look we look at them as objects as sex objects if you engage in pornography because that's what the porn world will make you want to think about women that they're just objects to just be used and disposed of afterwards does is that god's thoughts does god want us to think about the woman in that way but yet these sites that is exactly what they portray for man to think about women in that way or even young girls you know there's there was a documentary that that i downloaded about two years ago and it just it brings you know this into very it's a very good perspective of it and and and and it's it's more now there's more abuse in pornography now where like it's just beating the woman and and and things like that it's you know just just she's just trash and now it's the other way around too so it's satan trying to destroy god's image so that you can get some sort of sexual high and that is that is that is just a perversion so often creating addictions and dysfunction in real life relationships marriages and families the numbers are startling 47 percent of families report that pornography is a problem in their homes 47 of families in america teenagers who have frequent exposure to sexual content are twice as likely to experience teen pregnancy infidelity increases by 300 percent infidelity means that when a man or a wife or or husband are cheating on each other it increases by 300 percent when pornography is used 68 percent of divorces involve pornography or obsessive interest in sexual content you don't think that those things affect your mind affect your thoughts why are the why are these things happening then because remember they have to come to the thinking first then they do them and then 58 of sex addicts suffer financial losses because of their addiction somebody that's just addicted to that and you go to some of these websites and and and they charge for it and they know that they're going to make money because people are willing to pay for that you know back when i was growing up and when brother wade was growing up and some of us you know you you you'd go to uh you know like the you know in greenville south carolina we had over there called a little a little town store called the garden spot and you'd go in there you know you want to go in there and get a pack of cookies and some milk or or a soda or something but over there in that corner behind behind the beads there or at the movie store you knew what was behind there and you didn't go back there it it was it was it was you knew what was there and you it was forbidden and if if the if the store clerk or whatever the person in charge you know sees you as a little you know whippersnapper going in there he like son yeah something get down here get out come on i ain't getting in trouble for you tonight no i ain't getting the police calls for you but see nowadays it ain't like that because now everybody has the capability of carrying that beaded place that beaded corner in their pockets even the church you have the ability to view any website you want no matter where you are so now the indian tribes down in in different places or or or wherever you go that have cell phones now they can view it down down there you don't think oh you know god's spare know i wish i lived up in the mountain and in peace and they take those cell phones out there and they gain the same issues that you and me get down here in the cities it's satan trying to change the way we think amen look look at this as of march of this year i was i was just looking at it as of march of this year the top 50 most visited websites in the world and four of them are adult websites or pornography sites one of them is in the top 10 in the list which gets this is staggering 3 billion 94 million 991 895 average visits per month youtube.com how many like to go to youtube well i like going to youtube all right well i mean we're streaming this on youtube right now youtube gets which is the second most visited website in the world gets 35 billion 159 million eight hundred eight six thousand fifty seven average visits per month i mean that's just mind-blowing staggering now we gotta you can't even fathom that the first most visited site is google.com which gets 90 billion 751 million 889 and 638 visits per month now watch this biblehub.com biblehub.com which is a place that i like to go to when i'm studying only gets 27 million 718 495 visits per month million the other ones got billion now tell me if thoughts are not being changed around the world why is society the way it is since the advent of the internet people's thoughts are being changed people's thoughts are being molded and they're molded highly the difference between the visitorship of google.com and biblehub.com is a whopping 199.9 percent the difference the difference between the visitorship of youtube.com and biblehub.com is 197 199.7 percent and the difference between the visitorship of the adult site that i mentioned and biblehub.com is an astonishing 197.3 percent you think people aren't receiving thoughts through these sites amen they are you know imagine if the bible hub site was visited the exact same amount that the porn site was oh my that would be a different society amen it'd be different would you think it'd be different it'd be different amen i'm saying it's no wonder this world is falling apart if it was falling apart in brother branham's time how much more now you know technology is good the knowledge the internet is is a bite off the the tree of knowledge amen that's the reason why apple has their logo you notice that their logo is biting off the fruit i'm just saying well see they're still deceived because they think it was an apple they're still deceived but you can you imagine can you imagine if if if our thoughts if god if everybody's thoughts was was was about the word of god then you see it back in noah's day they say that they had technology like we have now why was the evil in everybody's hearts continually it had to spread a certain way right and internet has become that way of spreading things but at the same time the the tree of knowledge of good and evil right is good and evil it's a two-edged sword it's a double-edged sword so it can be used for good but satan has turned it amen to be able to to for for bad and it's and it's hurt more people praise god i'm not taking away your internet or your devices but god god is telling us amen you watch how you use these things right because i believe a holy ghost man amen can can overcome those things amen let me tell you young people you open your mind to just one of those images one day and it will change you i know that for a fact i know that personally i was introduced to that at five six years old and it has been something that you have to it's a it's a battle it's a battle that that god won't god god can take it away from you right away but it's you have to overcome as paul as paul was was telling us it's something that you have to overcome yourself and then if you're not careful you bring that into marriage life and it becomes a bigger problem so let us let us watch what we're being molded with online because and parents put do whatever you need to do do whatever you need to do i know that when they get to a certain age that's between them and god right but you when you while you can control it do what you need to do don't just give free reign to the internet and say oh i know my daughter and my my son they're gonna pick the right things no they won't they won't no he won't yeah so you have to be why did brother brown say that us we have to be their holy ghost up to a certain age until they get the holy ghost and so when you get the holy ghost then it gives you power to overcome that tree of knowledge of good and evil right to keep a balance on it amen praise god our meditations amen should be uh on his word should be day and night let's let's finish with this right here in psalms chapter one verses one two three blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly in other words that doesn't walk in the influence of the ungodly nor stands in the way of sinners nor sits in the seat of the scornful but watch his delight is in youtube.com all day long his delight is in pinterest.com all day long but how are you going to be blessed is if you make his your delight in the law of the lord and not just for one minute not just for 30 seconds not just when you go to church but in his law doth he meditate day and night in other words constant meditation constant meditation sure sometimes you know we watch the news sure we watch the weather sure we watch but we fall back that's not our absolute man amen we fall we put everything back on the word that's what helps the state stay stabilizes us amen that's what anchors us right and watch watch when you do this and he shall be like a tree planted by rivers of water do you think a tree planted by the water is going to be all dead and dry just all just leaves falling and every every tree that i've seen planted by rivers of water they've been nice and green and lush that bringeth forth his fruit in his season his leaf also shall not wither and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper amen i love that in other words it's what jesus said amen seek ye first the kingdom of god and his righteousness and all these other things will be added unto you amen praise god so saints you know we are bombarded with all kinds of all kinds of voices now amen we start talking to somebody and then they just want to start talking negative amen you have the freedom to just close your your at your ears and say i'm not hearing that i'm not hearing it gossip comes around you amen let's start talking about fishing let's change that subject you have the power to make those changes right sometimes we want to affect change and we want to say something positive and then here comes some negative word coming in but you have three two one one two three what in the world is bothering me stay calm yeah the word of god because sometimes it's better just stay calm i'll tell my daughter last night you know sometimes sometimes you know we just have to let people vent just let people vent after they vent they're fine after that let them say what they need to say but you can keep your mouth closed you don't have to reply respond to the venting right you you you you you can receive you can receive those thoughts and as they're coming to you and man they're just falling right off i'm not amen it's like you got that filter of the word right here all right right on your ears right let them say what they need to say and then you just move on you don't even have to reply anything back to that because it'll just keep going it'll just keep going it'll just keep going and there won't be nut it won't stop praise the lord amen but when you when you're with somebody and you're talking about god's thoughts amen i've received those all day long give me god's thoughts all day long amen and what it will cause you to talk about his thoughts as well praise the lord jesus you love the lord amen amen guard your hearts guard your your minds young people amen and and let me let me say this let me say this if you have fallen in those things there's mercy and grace amen there's forgiveness there's there's there god's god forgives you don't have to be a debtor you know sometimes we fall into even and it just doesn't have to be pornography or it doesn't have to be just you fall into something amen know that god is ready to forgive you all he's waiting for you is just to humble yourself and ask him that's all you got to do repent repent and you don't have to stay wallering in that because that is the lie of that is the thought of satan that wants you to just keep hot watering in that because because he's given you the thought that he won't forgive me for this i've been doing it too much i've been that's a lie that's not god's thoughts god's thoughts want to forgive you god's thoughts want to give you grace god's thoughts wants to give you mercy but he wants you to ask for it he wants you to know that you have the need for them and then he can give them to you amen praise god how many love the lord amen amen so think on these things praise the lord as we as the musicians come let's just
