got back afternoon i couldn't even get close to where it was going we're going to start over on the resurrection morning the saints arrive and let their voices ring he will be changed in a moment we'll hear the shout the trumpet sound and i shall sing as i stood beside the gravesite of a loved one like planting seed to wait and watch for spring when christ returns with all his power and glory he'll call for death to come to life and i shall sing when the shall sing on the resurrection morning the saints arise and let their voices ring those that remain will be changed in a moment we'll

name for your love that you've made manifest in our our day and time that we have we love you and we thank you have your way now but more than anything forgive our sins and keep us covered by the blood that we may be your little bride upon the earth guide us now in jesus name amen romans 8. i'm going to start in verse 28 through 31 and we know that all things work together for good to them that love god to them who are thee called according to his purpose for whom he did for no he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many brethren notice i wrote this in my bible because i write it i like to keep things i was talking about this morning where you used the word are there you know what it was speaking of or the word is i like to keep up with those things and look at that 29th verse for we know for whom we he did for no he also did predestinate to be that's a future extent right conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many brothers now watch moreover whom he did predestinate that's already done you know so i do those things in my bible because i like to keep it you know it makes my my learning stay that way anyway all right moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called already happened and whom he called then he also justified already happened in whom he justified them he also glorified all of those is past tense all the way through that verse what shall we then say to these things if god be for us who can be against us all right let's go over to ephesians 1 pick up verse 11 in whom also we have obtained an inheritance being already happened done finished predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the council of his own will you may be seated the lord add his blessing to the reading of the word now to back up just to hire this morning because you will see what we're trying to do the lord willing throughout this message and you know i say this is still a background for what the point i want to bring out or the thought so we may stay in this part for a little bit you know because the title will be for a while probably how does god predestinate all right now how does he predestinate then what does that mean so we will be tying with that but backing up like we were talking this morning of doing you know the the message the way i've tried to bring blessed is the man to whom god will not impute sin we found that that really the man that god won't impute sin to is the man that's not guilty you know he's not guilty because if he's guilty he has to deal with it so it's to the one that's not guilty all right and the man that god won't impute sin to is the lord jesus christ i hope you get that in your mind and keep that thought because he's not guilty he's guilty in that he took my place my guilt and took it upon himself to go pay the price for it but the real man that god won't impute sin is the one that's born again and there's only one born to get experience right all right so then you you see what i'm i was driving at right the man that god won't impute that too is the one that we read after life to those that are in christ jesus and that that seed remaineth any man he cannot sin what that seed cannot sin the person that that's dwelling in even though we have eternal life in our soul still in the rest of our being we can still do wrong and we'll do wrong because we are of that nature in ways because you're not born again in your body you're not born again in your spirit you're only born again in your soul the reason we're still here is that reason that's the reason we're still here if on the day of pentecost everything had been totally made manifest then they walked right off the earth and you and i wouldn't be here so you better thank god for the truth that god didn't do it that way i heard the other day somebody was talking about you know that they were already redeemed well i believe you're redeemed i believe we're redeemed i believe the price has been paid but it's got to be applied and it not being applied then we're still in bad shape israel was redeemed at calvary there's not another calvary to redeem israel there was redeemed but they are not even in their redemptive plan at this time so then we must hold it to that point and think about what we're doing all right now see then it'll it'll tie together that you'll see that this man in the bible is the man christ jesus i've preached to you for many many years wade's preached it good many times about genesis 1 26 26-27 you know let us make man and that was the theophany man that was christ i believe every born-again believer every born-again believer there's just one theophany and that's christ but i've got one up younger well that's what i said about our doctrine see instead of listening to what somebody says we're already as quick as something said we we click and you don't hear the rest of it uh i said three times recently that we were leaving at 10 o'clock yesterday and sister trudy came at 10 30 and so their divisor away to determine tennessee is 10 o'clock everything else is 10 30. so that's not throwing off on her just making a point you can say something over and over and over but people their mind is drifting they're looking they're doing something scratching out doing something writing something doing any and you can't listen when you're doing that i mean there's no way for you to be able to understand what's being said if you're not listening so i like for you to listen then make up your mind i like to do that i give everybody the benefit of the doubt i hear preachers say something that you take they're very wordy that they say and they're totally off the message but in a minute you let him bring his point right and you'll see it it's all right well let's let's get to point sit down and listen and cut off all your computers you know them things that's running that keeps you going out ahead of me and just listen well a background that there is a man that god will not impute sin to and that man is jesus christ and that man is now living in you by the new birth so that seed cannot sin that's remaining in you right now we're going to get down to some things later about this but we're going to try to hold it and just gradually go along like i said now this is a background so listen to the background let me read one i had left over from this morning go ahead brother and pull up the 1a i guess we called it let's listen to brother branham say something about this man that won't be imputed sin too and listen to what he says about it this is taken from the serpent seed 1958 9 28 evening paragraph 91 did not david say blessed is the man who god will not reconcile and impute sin too god don't hold the sin against this creature the one that's not guilty that's strong that isn't skinned milk but that's the bible god will not reconcile to the righteous god by his grace through predestination not willing that any should perish but all might come to repentance but being infinite and knowed who would come and who would not come he could predestinate everything to work to his will if he didn't do it you know if he didn't know if he didn't do it why did he permit sin in the first place when he was a savior i mean what the reason he promised because he's a savior all right if he'd never been a sinner he'd never been a savior their attribute within him could not be pulled out all right so then we're tying predestination into the man or this creature that sin is not imputed unto and remember the thought this morning it's in christ if we're not in christ they don't even worry about anything you know might as well forget it but if we can get to the point of understanding you know these things maybe we can get a better understanding but i'm asking you the question now there's a lot said about predestination there's a lot said about it this way i'm talking about in the message people used to target organized religion you know one way one way back and forth but even now in the message of the hour forgive me my sinuses keep acting up on me but i'll croak it out if nothing else but there's an argument over predestination and you use the word predestination but around said it's a bad word used before an untrained congregation but he said i use it you're a tabernacle so he was meaning there was or to be trained right right and i shouldn't be speaking to people today that is not trained at least to know some things about predestination and how it is and what it is but i'm asking the question how does god predestinate you know and how can he do it without being a respecter of persons does he pick some people and reject others all right so to me now it's very simple once the prophet explained it and i would invite you to go home take a computer run in predestination run in for knowledge and just read for days it's going to take you days to read the things that he says about but i want you to notice the connection so when we get started in a minute we'll be starting in the 50s and going through out the message through the years up to the 60s you know 65 to show that he kept the pattern and not as some people say well he believed this but he changed his thought here you know they say well we believe he was right before the seals broke but then after the scene you know was wrong before the seal bro and right after they broke and people even said the son of man had to come down straighten him out okay you believe what you want to i just don't believe it that way and that's why i like to give you quotes here and here in that way you can't argue the point about it but what do you think about predestination it was a major doctrine in the baptist and actually the church was split by two brothers over predestination and caused a great friction and divided the baptist church he came on into the presbyterian and they had a predestination doctrine all right let's come on over into the message and everything you know and people still don't seem to want to get it together because they work take the word predestinate and predestinate means to determine before go ahead and pull that up brother this is strong's concordance to give you the definition of predestination 4309 and what is it determined before ordained to predetermine to decide beforehand and in the new testament of god decreeing from eternity to for ordain a point beforehand now how can god predetermine something and not be a respecter of persons you know how can it be that he can do that and not be a choosing god you know to choose one reject the other and yet we read in about romans 9 there about jacob have i loved and he saw how i hated and that was before the bible said either one of them was born so how could god predetermine and deal with jacob bring him out to be israel and reject esau without a respecter of persons without a choosing factor that he would say i'll take this one and reject that one what do you think what do you think about it how that god runs his business i think it's a wonderful beautiful understanding but i think it needs understanding to get the house of understanding really we need a revelation understanding is only argumentative form you know you can argue over knowledge but you can't argue about a revelation that's a finished product as i say in today that means something present bless it is the man see now present all right revelation is not future tense nor past tense you can have a revelation of the future but revelation is really present tense eternity all right so we need a revelation more than anything but if not we're going to argue but at least we have one uh point or thought that organized religion didn't have we've got a prophet and we got his message all right see they didn't have an absolute type of form back there they didn't have something they could go back to they could go over here and say well luther said this others said well wesley said this it was just you know but we're supposed to have one message in one revelation all right now in doing that then how does god predestinate how does he make things work to bring out his will his thoughts it's like what we started with that had been not been uh sickness it was not been a healer and they'd not been a lost person they would not be a savior all right so if he was going to if it was going to be that away then he could predestinate if not then we're off the word because you just got him flimsy like us or something you know just doing it and i never understood it always the meanest kid in the crowd is the one that's loved the most you know you agree you got a bunch of kids and the meanest one always gets everything handed to him or her i don't understand that god don't work that away he doesn't run his business that way he he he doesn't do it all right but the main thing is do we believe that god is infinite do we believe that that there is a god and that there's no changing of his ways and he's eternal amen and he can never have a new thought his first thought is eternal and he can never have another one listen yesterday was or day before right around talking about that god can't give a revelation and then give something contrary to that he said now he can give a revelation and then he can add to that see like he first said you know in the garden i put enmity between that promise of christ then designate that that would come through abraham then designate it more in the word or open up the revelation that it would come to david and then come down to christ but that's not added revelation because you can't add to the revelation it's opening up of what was sealed in that revelation because revelation is eternal all right so then to look at it we have to first comprehend that god is real eternal there's no way to argue with him as it says in roman i believe it is how can the thing formed say why did you form me this way my brother methodist minister he said god made him a sinner and could not judge him for being sinful i said god didn't make you a sinner i said you made yourself one see we want to blame adam and eve for making us sinners that's not so we're the sinners we are the ones that just set in motion a situation it would fall down upon us but we are the sinners that way everybody stands before god as a personal being and he's not judging as a group that's right amen he's judging us too we are see we must first believe if you think that he doesn't know everything then there's no nobody talking about anything right there's no need to talk about anything in the bible if we don't believe god knows everything but how does he predestinate how does he do that he said well i believe it's this way let's just read some things go ahead with number two it's 1956 1207 and this is gifts e 15. now the first place the bible said that gifts and callings are without repentance it's something that god by sovereign grace put into the church i'm not going to deal with that subject of gifts and callings i will deal with it later in a message but get what he's saying it's what give some calling of god being without repentance you don't repent to get a gift you're either born with it you don't have it that's one way or the other you know you either got it don't have it it's something that god by sovereign grace no i believe he did predetermine some things we will get back to that later but just to get the thought in your mind see god does that himself it's a work and an act of god by foreknowledge he predestinates these things to happen now as i say god is not willing that any woods one should perish but in the very beginning god knew it would be saved and who would perish now did he know it as i said god is not willing anybody to purse but in the very beginning god knew it would be saved and it would be who would perish for knowledge let him know that if he's the infinite god why he he certainly cannot he's not willing that any should perish but he knew from the beginning in your fly ever flee every person that would ever be on the earth he knew them before the foundation of the world because he's infinite all right you agree with that now he knew everything he could predestinate his worker and act of god and by foreknowledge he praying estimates these things to happen all right now you immediately see that we're going to tie together for knowledge in predestination because the only way you can approach it to me now i made a statement there we'll come back to it later not dealing with gifts and callings of god but dealing with the fact that god did predetermine some things look at the next one and we'll get that point then we'll get back on our thought harvest time 1964 1212 paragraph 122-124 then god after adam had failed tried by the word and fail that's what happened to adam god continued in his creation and once to find a man who would live every word now look he's tried to find a man that is live the word of his age now you see god scattered his word out right because he could and we'll get back to this just so long as you won't jump too far on me we will get back to this it is not the person that comes predestinated eternally from god he said it's the word or seed all right so hold that in your mind now but he done it because he could so he scattered his word down through the ages it's not a haphazard thing that moses fell here jeremiah fell here ezekiel fell here you know and all of those built the body of christ all right that's not coincidental and it's not coincidental to have a luther or wesley of pentecost and the word to come down to the ages he is infinite and he is he is omnipresent now watch it he's omniscient therefore he knows all the time he can't be present everywhere right so god is not in our terminologies of the word omnipresent you see what he's god no he's a person he's a being do i need to go through those he probably said he's not like the wind he's a person so if he's a person he can't be omnipresent yeah but you're saying god no i'm not limiting god he did his own i didn't have anything to do with it he's not omnipresent in that he's not ever were always say he's not up on the moon today because as far as i know there's not supposed to be any anybody up there you know so he doesn't have to be there so he's a person all right now he's omniscient we're going to read these which means he knows everything and being omniscient he can be where he needs to be are you with me see then he's not on the present he's a being he's a person he's just not a spirit which oh god is a spirit he's just every word is floating no that's what i said if you don't believe in god correctly don't worry about predestination all right see watch them he is omnipresent omniscient therefore he knows all that he can't be present ever by being omniscient knowing all things then he can be present everywhere right all right because that's the way he predestinates us by foreknowledge not because he desired that this person should be saved and this one lost but he knew he would be lost and who would be saved see therefore by his full knowledge he can predestinate he makes everything work to his glory that's what his attributes are doing explaining to his glory one vessel of honor one of dishonor but it's god that maketh it not him that willeth or him that runeth but god that showeth mercy all right now the way he predestinates my foreknowledge he knew who would be lost and he knew who would be saved okay now he says he doesn't will get to it he doesn't pick one lose the other so that does away with the doctrine of the people of the message that you know i'm the certain seed i can be saved the people of the message it split over that point a lot of the preachers believe you're then adam you can be saved but if your genealogy within the beast you can't be now i want to see that in the bible or the prophet's message that would be putting it where he would handpick that would put it that were we say serpent seed can't be saved what is serpent seed i'm looking at the seed of the serpent i know the preachers don't like that one but i'm looking at you are you looking at me we were all brother brown said born between eve and the serpent what he says now you need to quote now i know that there was a lineage that comes from the beast we know that there was cain his descendants etc there was a lineage that come from abel right coming down ourselves as you'd say taking it home but when you start trying to deal with it what are you going to do when brother ryan said when it come to the flood it was so intermingled until no one could decide what i mean see that way it comes up with all these doctrines that they teach well you always was eternal that comes from predestination that you could be saved but other people couldn't well i think i've got it in here where jacob and esau but around him i'm pretty sure i got it he said both parents holy that's what he said said both parents holy and one of them comes a rascal the other one becomes seed that's what everybody does once they want some kind of a tantalizing thing to hold with the people oh ain't that wonderful i was always a seed what kind like everybody says brother brandon saw me there well remember he was in hell and beyond the curtain of time and he saw faith in hell and he saw people in heaven now which one are we well what do you mean i was in heaven yeah but do you understand yes it's not that he desired that this person should be saved or that person should not be saved but he said by his foreknowledge now i love this one because there's a lot of these if you'll run it in a predestination looks back to poor knowledge for knowledge looks to destiny but just to pick one we've got one the power of god praise in 1955 said the word predestinate that's not a good word to use the word for knowledge is better predestination looks back to foreknowledge and foreknowledge looks to destiny but god not making set in order a little hole that you have to go through and can't go no other way but god in order to be god you know the end from the beginning so he could predict it and set things in order to happen now predestination looks back to foreknowledge and foreknowledge looks to destiny all right now the way i look at that i look at that with a thought in mind predestination here i am here looks back to foreknowledge okay i'll move over here to illustrate right that's predestination this is for knowledge so if predestination looks back to foreknowledge which one's first you know we're going to do away with all that predestination doctrine amen we're going to talk about fore knowledge so if predestination looks back to foreknowledge and foreknowledge can look to your destiny then which one's first did predetermining or predestination come first ordered for knowledge for knowledge was first carnal illustration with a good thought see so don't worry about predestination be concerned about foreknowledge now according to webster foreknowledge is the fact of knowing before so then there's got to be a foreknowledge first and then there can be a predetermining because of that foreknowledge okay so if it's for knowledge then predestination looks to foreknowledge for knowledge looks back to destiny we back up to foreknowledge and when we look at it in four knowledge foreknowledge is the fact or act of knowing before any problems the actual fact of knowing before all right now what did he know before what did he know before that he would predestinate by what he knowed not predestinate by his desires but the bible said your desire to all be saved so you're going back to foreknowledge and foreknowledge is a fact of and the infinite god that is not choosing but he's knowing that's right amen don't you think god knew what we'd do before we got here on then get away from predestination that's what brought around said it's a hard word or a bad word you'll call it why because everybody's locked on it predestination that's determined before so god determined this so then that person didn't have no hopes because god made it that away that's determining we back up to foreknowledge right we'll get down to where brother brown says it what i said brother branham where were we he said before the foundation of the world in god's mind said where we spirits back there he said no we wasn't nothing it was only in god's mind now you mean to tell me that we believe in an infinite god that can save our souls that can heal our bodies that will be able to change us and and all the things that we try to believe of salvation but yet we're serving a peanut brain god that didn't know before the world now we get back to the attributes of god attribute of a healer savior etc now he had them in him before there was any foreknowledge god didn't gain attributes as he came down see you know first you needed a savior then you needed a healer and you needed this or that no he had those attributes within him but he's going to get him displayed now how can he do that and not make you a sinner you gotta have a center right right you can kind of deal it down around about the sickness you know when you come to salvation you can't deal it all dally you got to look at it front up how could he make you lost and it display his attribute that would be determining beforehand well let me back up what a storm i want to go predestination looking to foreknowledge back to it for knowledge look into destiny the destiny was already determined but not by predetermining factor about foreknowledge how does god predestinate without being a respecter of persons he predestinates by his foreknowledge but in his foreknowledge he knew do you need these quotes he knew that if he made us we'd fall you need that that's what your prophet said he knew we'd fall by making this way he did so you see him in the eve right we want to blame me for every bit of it but he made adam with all the products and everything for physical reproduction didn't want to blame me for the whole thing just remember the bible says an adam all die so let's don't harp about the women too much let's get it straight he made them the way he made them knowing they were going to fall right did the fall bring into being uh products within the body of even adam to reproduce children no the only thing that adam and eve didn't have the rest of us got was a belly button they didn't get the belly button you've never come with one god creator just like adam no belly button rest of us no problem we got a belly button big ones little ones ugly ones pretty ones belly buttons all right do that to make your life a little bit get you shaken but now are we dealing with predestination as determining beforehand are we dealing with foreknowledge that is way back behind the predestination factor see the bible said that jesus christ stood as a lamb slain before the foundation of the world that was before we ever come into being upon earth right and he says your name was written in the lounge book of life before the foundation of the world it will never be written in the lounge book of life book of life you can argue not two books two sections of one book invisible union you just got two reading one leads out to the other all right but see we want to go with it and try to predetermine it without going by foreknowledge but it will go by foreign knowledge we've got the problem solved that's right you know why because predestination has got to be out here in front of four knowledge right i kept walking backwards and forth to get you to see that right predestination looks to foreknowledge foreknowledge looks back going by his predestination to a foreknowledge all right now and in doing that little brother said he he done it so in order to be god he couldn't be a savior couldn't be a healer it couldn't be all of those things had it not been for the fact that mankind was going to fall now here is where we go well if he made us knowing was going to fall we didn't have a choice were you messing up you're going to predetermine and leaving foreknowledge out of it now did jesus physically die before the foundation of the world you know no two thousand years ago now had two thousand years ago not taken place there would have been no writing about that he was explained before the foundational world see before the foundation of the world there was no plan to save you now i hope you understand me because even once man sinned those old testament saints could not come into the redemptive form of the new birth so thereby there was no way to make the full plan of god effective in the old testament would have to come to the new testament to be able to bring it out now just remember he said brother dale you're only confusing me i'm not confusing you i'm exposing your confusion i'm just letting you know that you're confused right has any problem with that no well see i get blamed for confusing people i can't understand him he's so deep deep of what i just read what the prophet said amen amen yeah but you illustrated it well what are you going to do i'll give you a fulfill let you illustrate it see church we think we know what we're talking about i'm going to go ahead and put this in the reason we're here today 40-something years after the prophet was going is because of our mass confusion because of our organized religion remember we preached the message i didn't really realize it was going this way but i knew i'd hit it somewhere but that's all right and we emphasized a couple of messages that brother branham says on the feast of the trumpets that the holy ghost had been bound for two thousand years at the door of creeds and dogmas now if it's been bound 2 000 years you count on your finger it's only been 2 000 years since calvary right so the holy ghost was never loosed the way he wanted to you said well boy you're throwing off a great book about you've got all evening for us to go through the book of acts and see all of them denominational doctrines it was already in the book of acts philippus naiminius was teaching the resurrection was already pissed in the book of acts paul was having to rebuke peter in the book of acts right there was james trying to get everybody circumcised in the book of acts so the holy ghost has never been loosed but he said it would be loose by the end time message then said be loosed by the prophet be loosed by the end time message that he brought where is it going to be loosed at in you and me well brother dale it sure don't look like it because you know there was some of them saying a little bit about it last night you know bad times right i went out there i just couldn't help it i don't say too much so i just said well look the bible says when the enemy comes in like a flood the spirit of the lord will raise up a standard i see that's bible i'm happy to be here i'm glad we're in this bad economy you're glad yeah because it means god's here the church always will probably said done better under persecution we'll bring it on we've either get better or worse one that's right he said well why in the world all these things happening the bible said that's one army that i sent among you to try you can't come by or locust caterpillar read your message read the bible that wasn't god's army they didn't come from god he permitted it that's right to come among us to trust he said this bride would prove to satan that she wouldn't fall like eve all right bring it home you see yeah but you may be calling your own death well i hope for certainly one thing if they come and get me somebody will step up here and still tell you the truth amen i've never been concerned about that why because he can't get me until god gets through with me when he's too with me i need to get on out of the way maybe we'll get old enough one of these days we'll do that another 40 years and hear that did you honey here look at the next one my point is to get you to keep looking at that predestination looking back to foreknowledge but then for knowledge looking totally on to your destiny just going but back and totally back up price predestination this is from where i think pentecost failed 55 11 11 um e 28. now the word is usually here in the fifth chapter predestination predestination is not a very good word for an evangelistic or minister to use because it kind of confuses people when you say predestination why does it confuse people for you to say predestination because they already got their ideas about what predestination is right it don't confuse anybody that doesn't already know what they think about it right i mean the first time i heard predestination didn't bother me at the baptist church that's so good that's for knowledge see i didn't have to correct all that when i come to message i could see it back there because i could read the bible some people don't like that though predestination speaks looks back to foreknowledge for knowledge looks to destination predestination goes back to foreknowledge so you see it i was saying it now i'm reading it okay for knowledge goes to destination in other words here is a prophet explaining what he says right in other words god didn't say now make this man to be this and i'll make this man to be that he didn't say that but in order to be god he had to know the end from the beginning so in order to foreknowledge that he knew he could say this would happen and that would happen because he was god and knowed where everything would be placed and therefore he could ordain certain things for certain ages you believe that that's fully scripture he ordained in the days of martin luther the message of the just shall live by faith by foreign we're going to get it in a second before knowledge he knew that message was following luther no not for the world he made luther no you done predetermined him too much get the story look at the next one the junction of time 1956 e37 did you ever read over there in romans 9 how that he said before either boy was born he saw in jacob and said i hate one and love the other how can he be just and do that yeah that's what he said by four knowledge he knew what a rascal esau was and he could predestinate he could say that old boy's going to be a rascal why because he knew what he's going to do right now just say the word pretty it's not a good word to you it's for knowledge because he wouldn't just at deliberately turn you away because it's because you have he wants you to go he wants you to go away now he's not saying read it what i'm saying sometimes you read what brother brown said and you say well he said it he's not saying that he wants you to go away that's his point that his mind is moving backwards and forth like we all do see he wouldn't just deliberately turn you away because it's a because yeah he wants you to go away no he don't want you to go away why he's not willing that any of you should perish you see he's not saying it the way we they say just what he said you want to quote with me a little bit he said luther denominated and died and went to hell you need that quote he said you mean the prophet said that that's what he said but he ain't talking about luther right who's he talking about the lutherans who denominated and died well now you're putting well put yours to it you got yours on it he's not willing that any of you should perish but by foreknowledge he knows what you'll do even before you ever come on the earth sure for knowledge he's infinite he's god he's omnipotent i'm the president omniscient see he knows all things all wisdom and all time covered all's facing power he's infinite and if he isn't that he's not god if he is an almighty god he if he can't ju if he can't do all things he's not almighty god but if he's almighty god he can do all things see so that's the way we have to believe him all right he doesn't want anybody to be perished you know to purge or anything so then we'll we'll probably cut here and continue this wednesday all right with a lot of the quotes but i want you to get the point because the point is what i'm after for you to get what i'm talking about predestination is a destiny determined beforehand all right now foreknowledge is back before the predestination see we want to make him predetermined and then foreknowledge it no no we can't do it you're backing up predestination too far you're putting it predetermined without having full knowledge god by foreknowledge now i got a quote in here even the word wrote around said he knew where that spirit would fall like the little woman at the well he said how could that predestinated seed work out into that person brother you believe in a predestinated seed i sure do if you don't you got a problem a predetermined seed yeah we'll get down to that but i want you to get to mine thing how does he predestinate by his foreknowledge then he knew before the world begun who would be saved and who wouldn't be saved even though we had not even come into being as a spirit or being or anything he had those attributes in him to be savior healer etc so he would have to predestinate the prophet said somebody to be lost right right great brother don't mind saying it like that in order to be god he'd have to predestinate somebody to be lost well that means he's making them be lost without giving him a choice no because we've done backed up to four knowledge see as long as you keep it in four knowledge you can let him set back before the world when he wasn't even god because god is an object of worship and it wasn't anything to worship him and you could see him sitting there knowing that when he made the world what we would do he know jacob would want that birthright now honestly what don't you think in the illustration of jacob we know what that types but you know jacob didn't give a hoot about heaven you mean the birthright to jacob was going to make him go to heaven no the verse right to jacob was going to make him rich on earth that types the point of you and i see we take it and we say look at that jacob wanted this esau didn't want it we want to try to make it some salvation when jacob was just concerned with getting that natural birthright because my understanding of it was a double portion because remember esau got a blessing too he saw that a lot too you know but it was a double blessing double portion to the one with the birthright jacob wouldn't talk about going to heaven he's wanting all his sheeps and goats and and land and to be able to rule over his brother you know he's still a shyster but yet he had a desire about that birthright that would mean somebody would come down here see and have a desire about the birthright of the baptism of the holy ghost jacob wasn't talking about the baptism of the holy ghost amen he was talking about natural properties and natural things that would speak of what you and i desire all right now then god would look down and he could see that jacob would be the way he was and he sort of be the way he was so before the world he could go ahead and predetermine it that's right not now here's where we got to get it not that he took these two put them in a position and made them do what they'd done come on he didn't make jacob be there he didn't bake he saw me there if he did he's guilty right that's right he's guilty of a being a respecter of persons see that's where the people in the message they like to get it all make you just feel so good and you just shout oh it's in case you just see this together he was born with that seed down in there and in case you just see that seed down in there oh i just feel like it's something yep napoleon did too you remember that guy you know napoleon thought he was uh come down from some other you know he's been here before you know maybe you don't even study your history with all that but listen if god picked one over the other as a priority or a specialty or because he liked one better than the other one he can't judge us for being sinners then we'll see i can see them on computers ron see people in their mind they just run them the bible said he know good and evil he said he created good and evil now how could a eternal god create evil if he created evil he can't judge evil for being evil he knowed when he created it it would be evil not that he created it wrong see we've got all of that we think we know i'm sorry it's like i said i don't preach to try to tear you up i preach to try to straighten us all up get us to think yes but brother dale you just don't believe that there was a predestinated seed up in heaven i've done preached on it to you and i'll get back to it maybe some of you didn't catch then and then maybe you slept a little so we'll get back to sometimes what happened before the world ever begun i like what the old black brother said about that don't you you remember the first one brother brown heard the old guy with a little rim i heard an old man with the old wolf coat and led him up to the pulpits brother and said he took his text on what happened in glory and brought it down to earth he said everybody else was dealing with what was on earth i'd love to heard that old man preach god if you know what you're doing you could rejoice with him but do you understand what i'm saying brother dale he made me wrong he didn't make you wrong he gave you a choice ever even it doesn't matter after the fall or whatever every baby is born with a choice that's why you have an age of accountability right because that's when the person starts making their choice now i can't help it he put me he didn't put you in the pawn shop i preached a couple of messages about 10 years ago on that he didn't put you brother dick in the pawn shop you put yourself in there you started sinning and that puts you in the pawnshop god didn't make you go to the pawn shop see we saw oh he put me in the pawn shop i can't have it no he didn't put me there i put my own self there by the choices i made in life but you see what i'm talking about yes foreknowledge is the greatest thing that we could ever think of and why's the doctrine always been about predestination right have you ever heard anybody preach their doctrine of foreknowledge no they preach on predestination before knowledge is before predestination i just got through an hour and i have proven it to you right then why couldn't it be that god before the world that he knew when he made us that we'd fall but he didn't make us fall he just made eve with the ability to and you know adam could have still backed up and said no way no way make me another one i'm losing ribs but get me some more but he didn't do it god knew adam was going to do what he done like my mother said my daddy she's talking to him on predestination and said they're speaking cotton then my daddy said i don't believe that predestination you know she said i believe you know she told i believe god you know predestination no he said does god know i'm gonna pick up bowl of cotton she said yeah you know he said okay i'm going around it see i thought he pulled something over on him he just went around the bowl of cotton left hand how many did that change god no just left a bowl of cotton but you see church why is everybody dealing with predestination and nobody's dealing before knowledge amen god before the world stood as a lamb slain jesus christ and all names was written in the book lounge book of life before the foundation world that's right because god foreknew those who he foreknew we're gonna get down to some scriptures what does it say those who he foreknew he did predestinate it doesn't say those he predestinated one day he's going to know about him listen folks i'll end it by saying it this way we brother tom had a good point years ago he used a little odd way of saying it he said brother dale i see it he said we trigger our predestination i said that's a good way of saying it you know see we were the ones that made the choice god didn't make me make the choice but you just laid it down in front of me he's ah i just can't see it that way don't brother there because there's paul doing everything he's doing wrong and god just dropped down and saved him it didn't matter what you mean the guy that's explaining poor knowledge and predestination right nobody else explained it right that's right i mean none of the others use it for knowledge predestination in the writings you know all together and he is the one that you would think that god said i'm going to save him it don't make no difference he just knew how to get his attention so he slapped him off the horse but that wasn't the first attention that's all we know that wasn't the first attention god got him paul when he saw stephen being stoned to death and seeing stephen saying lord forgive them but around said that bore on his mind and he said he wanted to die because of what he'd done but we think he was just on the road to damascus got knocked down by great bright light and this all happened that's catholic doctrine catholic doctrine is that you ordered make people be saved whether they want to be saved or not and they say look at paul he was there and they god smote him down and made him get saved he didn't make him get saved smiting paul to knocking him down didn't give him the holy ghost come on he didn't get the holy ghost because he slapped him off the horse why would he send what ananias he sent him down there he said you go down there paul gets up and he gets baptized and then and i says god's going to show you what you're going to go through with he's going to send you to the gentiles paul gets the new birth and he's ready to go see we want to make predestination a great thing why not back up to full knowledge well brother around and we'll say it we'll get to it he said if you wasn't in that word a part of that word before the world you never will be he said if you wasn't in the mind of god you never will be well judas was in the mind of god every person in the world is in the mind of god but the mind of god knew that jacob would want that birthright and that esau would reject it he knows exactly what our choices we make and we can't blame him for anything blame your choices brother done a good job life's not talking about that the choices we make in life we choose the wife we marry you know the work we do the line of work whatever we do we choose everybody left then we turn around and say lord he was the woman you gave me he said i didn't give her to you you went and got her put up with it right moses it was japora he said you got sephora and you live with her oh boy look around said there was some mighty hot-headed fights going on out right on the backside of that desert and then she comes up there one day and saves his life because she's hot-headed because god was fixing to kill that prophet right and zepora grabbed a baby and circumcised it said daughter bloody husband hasn't been for her he'd been dead see we don't cover for knowledge we cover pre-determining one day we will get to a predetermined to understand that there was a seed of god yes brother brown said you come to that seed in you but what did he say that seed was come on he said it was representation and i'm quoting him from predestination he said it was representation of predestination those are laying on the desk at the house so somebody out there just listen a little while we'll get out to it but you see church then i can take everything right around save and i don't have to back up i believe in a predestinated seed amen but i also believe there's one quote in here i also believe that brother ryan said every person in the world every person he says was born with this desire in them to serve god sure does away with serpent seed don't but yet in the message see if you happen to be born of adam you can be saved but if you're born of the beast and eve you can't be saved well what are you going to do with jacob and esau coming from the same mother and the same daddy but yet i'm not popular because i tell it too straight everybody wants to feel good well i can get some ice and make you chill pumps if you want it we try to turn the thermostat down and everybody gets cold someone glory in the fact that we don't turn it down someone glory in the fact that we do and you'll never satisfy everybody like sister gayle said years ago she said get all them women going through the change of life and said you got problems well but you know what we don't have no problems i believe in predestination i believe by foreknowledge god knew every person that would be sitting here today but he knew who wouldn't be here and he knows why they're not here you see i get up every day believing in the foreknowledge of god but you know my foreknowledge is a little different than everybody else i guess i don't get up and say well what's predetermined to happen today what's presbyterian well i fell off that so that's over with i'm glad i got that done that was predestination and presbyterian i don't believe that i believe i'm walking around looking in and saying huh don't step down and go down this way god for knew i'd have enough sense to be able to use my brain to keep me from falling off of that foreknowledge is very simple has any of you ever had a vision or a dream of a future event a future something's going to happen later see a lot of people has never had that but if you ever have it you'll figure out god does know things you know he knows something's going to take place and he can say okay that's it it's going to be that way my wife and i were up in the garden one day was doing something picking beans or doing something i told her something's gonna happen i said if it don't happen i won't preach anymore. she said well you preached your life sermon what she was she was as honest as could be i mean when i was a teller it was impossible but i'm still preaching see if you ever have something to where you know where you're at you know god's foreknowledge is working because he's done shoji he showed that prophet a bride standing there dressed he saw that in the back parts so some of them was weaving in and out and wouldn't straighten up and i believe that's kind of where we're at and but you know what he showed him a bride well you come along and say well brother branham don't i don't believe it could be that way well you know what i might have messed up i don't think you could have convinced him i've had two or three incidents where i've seen it before and there's no way to tell me if the lord shows me that there's no way to tell me that it's not going to be that way i mean you're just wasting your breath why because i've already seen it that's full knowledge that's what god done before the world he looked down through time and saw everybody he knew who would want to be saved and who wouldn't want to be saved but he didn't go down through there i picked this one and i'll pick that one i'll leave that one i think now right by his foreknowledge he knew what you'd want i love him for that you know why because that makes me with a choice understand that makes me with a choice come on musicians foreknowledge how does god predestinate my foreknowledge which comes first predestination or foreknowledge for knowledge comes before predestination and for knowledge he can look all away and see the total end of the destiny was it not even job that when he saw it he said i know my redeemer amen he said i know i'm going through this but i'll come forth well because he had god's foreknowledge given unto him there is a predetermined word that falls in every age but there's a four knowledge people who received that word and walked there in what do we think about it what do we got brother oh we're going to do 523 in the spiral book up there i don't know where they can or not they're going to cry of course i got them up here i guess let's do it and put them up there first time we're going it's later than you think the pride is prepared for our lord all things is a people who is anybody you know what that combine is you really know what that combine is that's the world council of church what your prophet said don't you go out there in the field right now and you watch it they got a combine that's going forward that combine is taking the wheat putting it into a special place just cutting that stalks down it's binding them and sending that chap out into the field do you really want that combine to become it water valley you have a need for knowledge and god don't make anything happen but he knew it would why couldn't he send brother branham another way instead of facing that car out there in texas what about it very easy to see him down another road but when time and eternity met there was no choice for it to be no other way because that was the end of god's thought what about us father we know our brother got hurt the other day there and it because these problems and things to happen in the body now we just ask you to come down and take them away just let your love be made manifest you knew before the world ever begun it our brother would get hurt but you knew he'd be standing here today to be able to ask you knew that by your stripes he's healed and we thank you in jesus name anybody else it's later than you think a right you know i ran across a quote one time that of course all of it does but it thrilled me one day to read because we always thought about god being impersonal where they stayed up in heaven you know and off but brother brown said even after the fall and said with israel being at all that they were doing and all of their wrongs and everything he said god came down and busied himself with the people even though they're doing all the wrong they were doing he was still right there leading them home that's a great god why didn't he just say i know what's going to happen i'm going back up wait in heaven that's a good predestination doctor no but by knowledge he knew he needed to be there predestination would let him know where everything was gonna be that's fine but he wanted to be there don't you love him don't you love him for the word that he's given us the day and the hour that we're living to where we can understand father we thank you lord for your love this day we thank you for calvary thank you for all the things thank you for revealing that word unto us that we may walk durian and we pray now that you just help us as we come to an end of the service now and the people travel on the way home in may lord you take care of everybody you give everybody a safe journey and father we believe that even prayer can change things so if it's already dead set as we're taught how could prayer change the mind of a god until he would do other things but then he would know that we would be there to do that to start with and ask for that so it's just doing what you said you'd do i'll be with you alway even to the end of the world we love you and we thank you and we commit it now to you in jesus name amen you're dismissed moment you
