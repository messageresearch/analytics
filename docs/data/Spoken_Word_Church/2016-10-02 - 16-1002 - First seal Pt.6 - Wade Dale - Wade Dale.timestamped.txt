[0:00] yes thank
[0:06] you all right now we were discussing
[0:09] last Sunday we were talking about false
[0:14] bit on Christ what we were doing I hope
[0:18] you understood what I was talking
[0:22] about I was thinking more
[0:24] yesterday the being the greatest
[0:26] deception if you if you can't see one
[0:29] true Living God if you can't see means
[0:32] to understand right don't mean you got
[0:35] to see you got to understand one true
[0:38] and living God and that Jesus Christ is
[0:40] his name there's no other God before him
[0:42] nor other God after right but that there
[0:45] are three manifestations of that same
[0:48] God but if you watch the devil knows the
[0:51] weak part and the word's not weak people
[0:54] are weak right he knows the weakness
[0:58] what I was thinking about yesterday he
[0:59] knows every one of your weaknesses
[1:02] before you
[1:04] do before you know it so he has already
[1:07] developed a plan I say just like the
[1:10] Catholic Church the Catholic church
[1:12] plans 30 years in advance oh yeah
[1:14] governments plan years in advance I I
[1:17] think we sit here sometimes and we go we
[1:20] we make God so small and then we make
[1:22] the devil so small well yeah the devil
[1:25] is not he doesn't have any power but he
[1:27] does have to work to us and I was also
[1:29] thinking yesterday
[1:31] that um uh you know what does a Creator
[1:33] need with
[1:36] us he self-existing he needed no one to
[1:40] begin with that's right but his desire
[1:43] is just like our desire is is to have
[1:45] friends and family that was his desire
[1:48] so whatever God's desire is the problem
[1:50] with us we have a desire to do something
[1:53] and then we we you know a lot of people
[1:56] you say boy I got big
[1:58] plans I got these plant um and then they
[2:02] get
[2:03] Qui yeah a little bit but that's okay
[2:05] I'll step over here um you know I've got
[2:07] big plans but now a lot of times those
[2:09] plans don't come to pass why we don't
[2:12] know the future we don't know every
[2:15] Avenue but now not God his thoughts are
[2:18] Eternal so whatever he thought that's
[2:20] what's going to happen that's right and
[2:22] it's going to develop into a
[2:25] reality cuz listen God's not a
[2:27] fantasizer you understand what I'm
[2:28] saying in in the you know sometimes we
[2:30] sit and go boy what can I do with a
[2:32] million dollars and what can I do with
[2:33] see that's human thoughts and ideas and
[2:36] and fantasizing and things that that
[2:38] maybe never come to pass don't tell me
[2:40] you've never sat and thought about
[2:41] something that never come to pass oh
[2:43] yeah millions of times you know well why
[2:47] we're finite we don't know the journey
[2:51] you say what's this got to do with the
[2:52] seals that horse rider took a journey
[2:56] yeah right he rode where did he ride
[2:59] through
[3:02] me
[3:03] you he's not out here riding it would be
[3:06] wonderful if he was out here riding on
[3:09] the highway we would let him continue
[3:12] where he's going that's right but we're
[3:15] like Brother Gary Atkin said we we give
[3:17] him bows and and I'm telling you another
[3:19] thing this is this is for me we pull the
[3:21] rains and bring him back toward us yeah
[3:24] you know how you pull the horses range
[3:25] and you turn them around that's what we
[3:27] do we get that fellow like brother R was
[3:29] talking about riding away from us and
[3:31] then we go well no I don't know me say
[3:33] about that you bring him right back you
[3:35] know bring him right back but we must
[3:38] see that power go
[3:40] away and stay away now with God like I
[3:44] said with God he's in a
[3:46] journey predestination listen like
[3:49] Brother D has been talking about
[3:50] predestination is very simple and that's
[3:52] why the steals takes every Avenue and
[3:55] puts it right in line predestination is
[3:57] a predetermined destination
[4:01] that's what predestination means pre
[4:03] before you get here pre Destiny is a
[4:07] journey determination your determination
[4:10] has been destined by God but it was not
[4:13] just that God put you in a tube and
[4:16] pulled you through it and said you're
[4:17] going to do this and this and this right
[4:20] he gives us guidelines right to go by
[4:23] but he knows why do you think he put him
[4:25] out there why do you think he put the
[4:27] guideline out there somewhere down the
[4:30] road you'd need it that's why he put
[4:32] that in the word he put every scripture
[4:34] in that word to where if you have a
[4:36] problem you can go right to it well how
[4:38] do you know
[4:39] that he's infinite we are
[4:43] finite but heading toward an
[4:48] infinite amen heading toward you
[4:52] yeah listen if we have the mind of
[4:55] Christ I thought we had it already here
[4:57] that's right we have the infinite one
[5:00] inside of us that's right and having the
[5:02] mind of Christ we can look through and
[5:05] and not exactly listen we can't
[5:08] predetermine tomorrow nobody knows what
[5:10] tomorrow is going to be that's right
[5:11] humanly that's right but if we pray to
[5:14] God he knows whether we'll pray for
[5:17] something or not he knew before the
[5:19] foundation of the world if we were going
[5:20] to pray for a certain thing to
[5:22] happen or not pray for a certain thing
[5:26] to happen right so that way he could
[5:28] predetermine that destination by for
[5:31] knowing everything that's going to
[5:33] happen from your life to your death or
[5:35] change of the body of whichever happened
[5:38] first
[5:39] right so as God's in a journey Satan
[5:42] rides out in a journey also where did he
[5:46] attack first he didn't attack no you
[5:49] don't need to be a prostitute you don't
[5:50] need to be that no one
[5:53] God he knew if he could break that
[5:56] Doctrine
[5:58] down and see 606 ad they tried it in 303
[6:02] took 300 more
[6:04] years wow that's slow development but
[6:07] buddy when
[6:08] Satan put it out for the people they
[6:11] accepted it even the Christian Believers
[6:14] accepted
[6:16] it
[6:18] right so it must have been pretty good
[6:20] you know it's like brother R says he
[6:21] Satan presented his
[6:23] product he presented a product that's
[6:26] right and they bought it right because
[6:28] you know why he knows your Humanity just
[6:30] like God knows your
[6:32] Humanity why do you think he waited till
[6:34] Eve and Adam got put in flesh before he
[6:37] did what he did in the garden he
[6:39] couldn't touch them while they were in
[6:40] that theophany that's he couldn't touch
[6:43] them that was God that was God in
[6:45] another form but when God put him in
[6:46] human
[6:47] flesh to be attached to the Earth Satan
[6:51] said all right I found the weak spot
[6:53] okay I found a spot to get into now
[6:57] right so honestly to be to be real to go
[7:01] way back Satan started riding as soon as
[7:03] he fell from Earth it wasn't that he
[7:06] just rode in the church age no man he
[7:10] was way back he he was the one in the
[7:12] Old Testament in in U theila and and the
[7:17] Giant and all the opposition that was
[7:18] Satan riding and presenting his plan and
[7:21] program listen it's so good his program
[7:25] is so good till it did almost deceive
[7:28] the very left right
[7:31] right that's how good it is it's not
[7:33] that it's bad cuz we going to read right
[7:36] here you talking about false Christ
[7:38] Anointed with the true Holy Ghost but
[7:42] false now that don't make the Holy Ghost
[7:44] false that's right all those is true
[7:46] amen now what happens between the truth
[7:50] Purity um unprecedented truth that has
[7:54] that that never ever can be
[7:58] changed but one it's filtered through
[8:00] your
[8:01] brain and Satan's tactics they come out
[8:05] with a
[8:06] trinity wow to me that's what's
[8:09] outstanding about that first seal when
[8:10] it opened it shows me and I believe it
[8:13] showed the prophet of God and any True
[8:15] Believer it shows what's false and
[8:17] what's true you got to start with that
[8:20] first if not if you would have started
[8:22] with a white horse
[8:23] rider four seals
[8:26] later that's the white righteous Church
[8:30] that's Satan working no God had to
[8:33] expose him right at first right yeah and
[8:36] expose that doctrine of hey we got to
[8:38] get back to one true and living God like
[8:40] the Bible says about zerubabel which we
[8:42] know that that's the type with brother
[8:43] Rand he
[8:44] came he didn't make a New Foundation he
[8:47] didn't make a new Bible right what did
[8:50] he do he swep off that
[8:52] foundation and built on it all right so
[8:56] what was it was it Satan's Foundation no
[8:58] it's God's Foundation
[9:00] mind built on Satan's Foundation that's
[9:02] right got
[9:03] it and he was so intertwined with God
[9:07] that's what to me is is is hard for my
[9:10] human brain to understand how Satan and
[9:12] God can I I don't say they work together
[9:14] but but they're real close
[9:17] right him being the most evil of evil of
[9:20] evil of evil yet he can stand right
[9:23] there beside God wherever God goes He
[9:24] just moves right there next to him
[9:26] wherever God moves he just moves right
[9:27] there next to him I that's hard for me
[9:30] to see because of all the when we see
[9:32] filth and things it looks like it takes
[9:33] us further away from God right we we
[9:36] feel dirty I mean just the little things
[9:38] we do we feel so away from God but
[9:41] there's Satan he's causing us to do that
[9:44] well who's causing us to do that
[9:49] actually who listen who's the root cause
[9:51] of this whole thing we are we are okay
[9:55] so when you see a when you see brother
[9:56] Rand and and what an outstanding
[9:58] statement here's a lamb with a book in
[10:00] his hand he had the book of redemption
[10:02] now brother R was not Jesus Christ he
[10:04] wasn't God but he was a representative
[10:06] at the time the only Prophet on the
[10:09] earth God can only speak through a
[10:11] prophet right and bring a word which was
[10:13] a pure word it wasn't a it's like
[10:15] brother R said he said I don't filter
[10:17] this through my brain right God brings
[10:20] it and he said sometimes he speaks
[10:21] things that he don't even understand
[10:23] himself why because it was God passing
[10:26] right through all that yes
[10:29] stuff
[10:31] Humanity error
[10:34] um Trials of life things that gets us
[10:36] all muddled up inside when brother Bron
[10:39] preached those deals he knew that God
[10:40] was speaking see God was speaking all
[10:42] along but he knew right then that what
[10:45] something was happening right there that
[10:46] had never happened before right God had
[10:49] loosed something that had never been
[10:50] that had been bound the prophet of God
[10:52] said by Creeds and dogas what was Creeds
[10:54] and dogas Catholic Church presenting
[10:57] father Son and Holy Ghost um
[10:59] um
[11:01] Trinity hell was eternal you see what
[11:04] I'm saying he was tearing the word down
[11:06] but what how was he tearing the word
[11:08] down through
[11:10] religion he wasn't tearing the word down
[11:13] through prostitution ranks and and and
[11:16] you know all
[11:18] this he was tearing it down in the
[11:20] church you know why Satan knew that he
[11:23] knew if he could get into the church it
[11:24] would be real easy to get out
[11:27] there think of that if he can get in
[11:30] here it's real easy to get out there cuz
[11:32] they have nothing to combat it with I'm
[11:34] talking about the world they have
[11:36] nothing to combat it with so if Satan
[11:38] can get in that's why it talks about in
[11:41] uh we're talking about the seat of Satan
[11:43] where he's sitting in the temple of God
[11:45] sitting in the temple of God that's
[11:47] right that's
[11:49] right showing himself to be
[11:54] God but when that prophet of God that
[11:57] first seal open to him he saw something
[12:00] move away from him right see now he had
[12:04] the doctrine of one true and living God
[12:05] correct but I believe once the seals
[12:08] open that it it brought it down to me
[12:10] and you so that you and I can understand
[12:12] that there's only one true and living
[12:14] God cuz see brother R preach one true a
[12:15] living God way back in the 40s and the
[12:18] 50s right he said but he said serpent
[12:21] Sav one go all these doctrines were
[12:23] revealed in the seal you say
[12:26] revealed I say completely revealed okay
[12:30] it was imp partiality all the way up
[12:31] through okay he never listen he never
[12:34] came up to the first seal and said now
[12:36] what baptism I've taught it as father
[12:38] son Holy Ghost now I'm going to teach
[12:39] the Lord Jes no he T father he taught
[12:41] Father Son and Holy Ghost was false from
[12:43] the beginning yeah but remember in the
[12:45] seals if you're reading any of the
[12:47] seals in the second or third seal he
[12:52] says I've always wondered why I was
[12:53] against now he preached why I was why
[12:55] I'm against organized religion in 1959
[12:59] 4 years before the seals open he said
[13:01] but now I understand why I was so
[13:04] against that
[13:05] thing what did it do it revealed
[13:08] something to him right that had never
[13:10] been revealed before and then what did
[13:12] he do he passed it to you and I right
[13:15] right and I like what brother Clark said
[13:17] one time he said brother Bown said I
[13:19] can't keep a secret well thank God he
[13:20] can't keep a secret God knew he couldn't
[13:23] keep a secret that's why he told him the
[13:25] secrets of the Bible so he could tell
[13:27] you and I amen
[13:31] and we have it in Book and Tape form and
[13:34] then we have to take it and running
[13:36] through our filter because we're
[13:37] individuals that's right all right but
[13:40] you see what I'm talking about you see
[13:42] why that first seal opening was so
[13:43] important is to is to go ahead and
[13:46] separate that thing now that we see this
[13:49] separation we see that Satan is so
[13:54] close then when the second seal opens it
[13:56] should be easier to see that red horse
[14:00] him getting on a red horse and riding
[14:03] that second horse it should be
[14:06] easier cuz we know who he is we know
[14:09] what the horse is we know what all the
[14:11] symbols are but we just got to get that
[14:13] underlying meaning of that seal that's
[14:16] right you say well I've always belied
[14:18] one true and R of God can you sit and
[14:20] explain
[14:22] it you ought to be able once that seal
[14:25] broke brother Bram he was able to
[14:27] explain things that no had ever
[14:29] explained in their entire
[14:31] life okay you got to know how to you
[14:35] what the Bible say you got to give a
[14:37] reason of the hope that's in you you got
[14:39] to be able to tell people well we
[14:41] believe in one true and living God so
[14:43] does the Baptist they'll tell you right
[14:47] they got a song out now by Steven Curtis
[14:49] Chapman is the one true God Jesus Christ
[14:51] the one true God now that's that's out
[14:55] in the secular or the um yeah
[14:57] ecclesiastical world Right singing about
[15:00] one true God and Jesus is his
[15:03] name you see what I'm saying you see how
[15:06] close one word off I'm telling you one
[15:09] word off in all these seals I don't
[15:12] believe brother Randon was one word off
[15:14] he was spot on he knew what he was
[15:16] talking about he had the confidence that
[15:18] God was doing the talking and that he
[15:20] had nothing to do with it okay to me I
[15:23] believe that's why he said I'm working
[15:24] in such a spiritual realm mhm I'm just
[15:27] letting go and moving out of the way but
[15:29] Now look for years he had done that he'd
[15:32] always tell he said I got to get myself
[15:34] out of the way so he can come but that
[15:36] was for The Healing
[15:38] Ministry what about a man standing there
[15:40] with the baptism of the Holy Ghost the
[15:41] Manifest the Son of God and he still got
[15:42] to wait on something
[15:44] the an
[15:46] anointing to tell the people what their
[15:48] problems were well I was you know I was
[15:50] thinking I did a lot of thinking
[15:51] yesterday we didn't just do a lot of
[15:53] selling we did a lot of thinking I did a
[15:54] lot of thinking but you take that
[15:57] scripture where it says that the word is
[15:59] a
[16:01] discerner of the thought you think well
[16:03] that's brother
[16:04] brand is
[16:05] it did he just tear that piece out and
[16:08] take it with him we have when we bring
[16:11] in the true word of God that's what
[16:13] brother R was trying to do when we bring
[16:14] in the true word of God that word you
[16:17] don't do it you and I will make a
[16:18] mistake that's right exactly but that
[16:20] word will divide what goes on in your
[16:23] soul that's right you notice it said
[16:25] nothing about your body that's right M
[16:27] cuz your body is nothing that's right
[16:29] your body never boy when brother Dale
[16:32] gets into this I hope he gets into this
[16:33] real good cuz your body never sin that's
[16:37] right do like your preachers do they
[16:41] go amen preach it Brother come on your
[16:44] body never sin a day in his
[16:48] life oh yeah it did no it
[16:53] didn't Adam and Eve were told to
[16:55] multiply and replenish the Earth before
[16:57] they were put in flesh bodies now we
[16:59] know what happened to Satan what he do
[17:00] he perverted it right right
[17:03] amen but your spirit and your soul is
[17:05] the two most wi is it say that's why I
[17:07] was thinking why does it not say
[17:10] body the word is a discerner of the
[17:12] thoughts and intents of the heart
[17:14] dividing us under the soul and the
[17:16] spirit didn't say a thing about the
[17:19] body listen your body came here only as
[17:22] a product of sin to get your soul inside
[17:26] of it so that God can work on it amen
[17:30] just like I was talking about um uh God
[17:34] is was encapsulated in that flesh called
[17:36] Jesus
[17:38] Christ yes but remember the capsule that
[17:40] you take has a hard lining around it but
[17:44] what inside's good for you but you got
[17:45] to take it that's right for it to
[17:47] dissolve hello somebody for it to
[17:50] dissolve
[17:52] right but it's gotten dissolved once you
[17:54] take it in that outside piece has gotten
[17:58] dissolved and let what's inside out
[18:00] exactly that's been our problem but see
[18:02] Satan knows that's what's our problem
[18:04] right that's why he beats on this thing
[18:06] yeah all the time we're a product of sin
[18:10] don't get me wrong this is a sinful body
[18:12] yes but it has not sined that's right
[18:16] what's inside of me is what's making me
[18:18] Smoke Drink curse my vocal cords don't
[18:21] curse on their
[18:23] own right does
[18:26] it no it just lays there it just it's
[18:29] just there it's just like brother R said
[18:31] it's just twitching muscles cuz Hey
[18:34] somebody mentioned it the other day and
[18:35] I really enjoyed it an animal's got life
[18:39] right it
[18:40] breathes it thinks to a degree that's
[18:44] true right right it and you know what it
[18:47] was having um it was multiplying and
[18:50] replenishing in those bodies sure was in
[18:53] the garden yeah the animal kingdom was
[18:56] procreating before Adam and Eve that's
[18:59] right that's right okay and that you're
[19:01] right that was okay for the thing it was
[19:04] given for so what did Satan
[19:07] do Twisted it uhhuh he said B he said as
[19:11] soon as God puts him in that flesh body
[19:13] I know where I'm going okay I know where
[19:16] I'm going and that's what he did but now
[19:19] what we got to do we got to reverse that
[19:20] out right if our soul is
[19:24] redeemed right if you're born again your
[19:26] soul is redeemed that's right we're
[19:28] waiting for the the Redemption of the
[19:29] body what are we waiting for we're
[19:30] waiting for that to filter through the
[19:32] spirit to get to the body but really
[19:35] it's the spirit
[19:36] realm that's cuz this thing like I said
[19:39] this thing's not sinning right all this
[19:42] does is a
[19:43] mechanism for your spirit and soul to
[19:46] work
[19:47] through Daddy was talking about to it
[19:51] we're coming to I I believe we're at
[19:53] that place to it we are understanding
[19:57] the Redemption of the body that bring it
[19:59] to pass that's correct I want you to
[20:01] think of something else too the word wit
[20:04] does mean understanding but if you'll
[20:05] keep
[20:07] looking what's the first word first
[20:09] what's the first syllable in
[20:15] witness can I say it
[20:18] wi to wit or to witness we're going to
[20:21] be a witness that's what w is to
[20:24] understand witness is well if you're a
[20:26] witness of something what do you do you
[20:28] saw it you understand what happened and
[20:29] you tell somebody about it right you're
[20:31] a witness so wit starts it with wit the
[20:34] syllable wit so Paul could say both to
[20:38] understand and to witness the Redemption
[20:40] of the body now when you witness the
[20:42] Redemption of the body you're either
[20:44] being redeemed or you're lost okay but
[20:47] the lost ones are not going to see I
[20:50] don't believe they're going to see us
[20:52] now let me let me I'm getting off the
[20:54] mark a little bit but when our bodies
[20:57] when we're changed
[20:59] in the moment in twinkling of an eye
[21:01] right I don't know that will disappear
[21:02] but I don't think the world's going to
[21:04] be able to to to what I'm saying is if
[21:07] Sister Trudy gets she gets changed and
[21:10] we're waiting that 30 to 40 days your if
[21:13] if your sisters were alive or your kids
[21:15] or whatever if they don't get changed
[21:17] they not I don't believe they're going
[21:18] to be able to to bother us or cuz
[21:21] remember Jesus said don't touch me I'm
[21:23] not yet sended there was a process going
[21:25] on in that in that glorified body but
[21:27] now once he did they could touch him but
[21:30] remember he didn't hang around him a lot
[21:33] he disappeared what I'm saying is you
[21:35] get a glorified body and and it's going
[21:37] to be hard for somebody to be around you
[21:39] that doesn't have a glorify body that's
[21:41] why I believe brother rown said we'll
[21:42] all be gathered together now who who
[21:45] cares where it is but I think we'll all
[21:47] be gathered together before we go up I
[21:49] really do where who knows if we're in a
[21:51] glorified body we can travel like I
[21:52] thought anyway that's right okay you can
[21:54] take a trip to Alaska and be back and
[21:56] you don't even know you went that's
[21:57] right
[21:59] you say boy that's real that's real um
[22:01] that's what you call fantasy no that
[22:03] ain't fantasy that's
[22:05] reality but we're going toward the
[22:07] witnessing the be the beginning of the
[22:09] change of the body yes because if your
[22:12] Soul's redeemed God's working on your
[22:15] spirit and your body he he's not working
[22:17] on the soul the soul is redeemed that's
[22:19] right right right those who he has
[22:21] Justified he has already glorified now
[22:24] he didn't say now not your
[22:26] flesh that's right did he not did he say
[22:28] that he never said that that's right
[22:31] those who he justified he's already
[22:32] glorified so you went from a Justified
[22:35] condition in your baby form if you wish
[22:38] all the way through the stages and you
[22:40] know how we teach it here three stages
[22:41] of justification three stages of
[22:43] sanctification just a higher order of
[22:44] the same justification right all right
[22:47] we know we did it in this justification
[22:49] I'm doing this for the younger on we
[22:50] know we did it the justification when
[22:53] you got saved told God ask God to
[22:56] forgive you of your sins he forg gave
[22:58] you of your past right then amen but not
[23:01] your future sin right but now when you
[23:03] get born again MH then he starts working
[23:07] justifying you through the statute of
[23:09] perfect man and then now as brother Dale
[23:12] and we're getting in the seals talking
[23:13] about adoption you're going to turn and
[23:15] be able to look and see that scripture
[23:17] those who he has Justified he's already
[23:19] glorified and that justified is see
[23:23] yesterday there was a there was a bank
[23:24] robbing in
[23:25] Atlanta now this morning they called and
[23:28] said I did it mhm I was inaz for
[23:31] yesterday I didn't do it that's right
[23:34] right I was accused of doing it that's
[23:36] right so whose problem is it the accuser
[23:40] that's why I said with these seals once
[23:41] you see to me the seals gives you little
[23:44] more
[23:46] ammunition to know what the devil's
[23:49] coming at you with and you can fight it
[23:52] amen yes I believe that's what the seals
[23:54] are for because if the seals are for the
[23:55] Redemption of the body it's got to be
[23:57] working in that Spirit Realm memory
[23:59] reason conscience affection and
[24:04] Imagination that's what we got to deal
[24:06] with cuz like I said the body is just
[24:09] it's just a
[24:12] structure for your soul and spirit to
[24:14] live in yes sir yes sir I was just
[24:16] reading that Jesus said clearly he said
[24:18] it's not the things on the outside that
[24:20] def follow man but the things that
[24:21] within that's correct that the Father
[24:23] the man the fornication and everything
[24:25] comes from within the man that's right
[24:27] cuz he said he said you eat something
[24:28] and it goes out the drop goes you know
[24:31] natural thing see Jesus went right
[24:33] straight to our Natural Body he told you
[24:34] what you eat goes out to go out the
[24:36] bathroom part that's right he was pretty
[24:38] plain he said don't worry about that
[24:40] that's right right that's right that's
[24:41] okay and that's been permitted that's
[24:44] that that's why you were given that
[24:45] that's right okay amen but the inside
[24:49] person is the one that that's got a fact
[24:52] that's right is that inside guy all
[24:54] right so it's just it's it's really
[24:56] bringing it to me it's bring it more
[24:58] down
[24:59] to
[25:01] um focusing on what's going on in our
[25:04] spirit if you're born again now if
[25:06] you're not born again you need to get
[25:07] born again then God can work on your
[25:08] spirit cuz if not if you got Satan
[25:11] inside kind of hard for God to work on
[25:13] the spirit part that's right right it's
[25:16] real hard that's right okay but with
[25:19] these seals this like I said it's it's
[25:21] no more than your new birth amen being
[25:26] made manifest more
[25:29] than it ever has before that's right
[25:30] brother bram's New Birth was to me was
[25:32] made manifest so much more when he was
[25:35] bringing the the operation of the seals
[25:37] the Holy Ghost was operating through
[25:39] that Prophet bringing the seals and
[25:41] opening them up okay because if you say
[25:44] they're closed then see you can't talk
[25:45] about this that's why I said the people
[25:47] that say that that the seals are closed
[25:49] they can't talk about this if you say
[25:50] the seals are closed I don't know if
[25:52] you're born again or not you know you
[25:53] understand what I'm saying yes cuz you
[25:55] don't understand that's right
[25:59] you you read that two with of redemption
[26:01] of the body and you know what you do you
[26:02] go well one day okay that's right and
[26:06] most people most denominational people
[26:08] now not so much in me most most
[26:09] denominational people believe that
[26:11] there's just going to be a date on the
[26:13] calendar that God's going to
[26:15] come want me at least in ter talk about
[26:18] they have a new Left Behind to move so
[26:20] you going to be left behind
[26:25] twice I get money but's see money some
[26:28] but Kirt Cameron bless his heart he
[26:29] ain't made it to Heaven yet he's Left
[26:32] Behind twice but in the movie though and
[26:35] the way denomination say that there's
[26:36] going to be a Rapture
[26:39] mhm I guess of the ones that deserve it
[26:42] first I'm not trying to be faist I'm
[26:44] trying to understand what they're
[26:45] talking about cuz they have a Rapture
[26:48] then after that they had a left behind
[26:51] and these people get saved after the
[26:52] Rapture takes place before the
[26:55] tribulation the foolish yeah they
[26:58] they're foolish foolish version but now
[27:00] I don't know about this next layer I
[27:02] don't know about that left behind but
[27:04] you understand it we laugh about it but
[27:06] we should cuz they sincerely believe it
[27:09] Hey listen a sincere Catholic will
[27:11] outlive you any day as far as going to
[27:13] church and work right yes but watch
[27:17] Satan he's work work work work work work
[27:19] work make them work so they won't think
[27:21] yeah that's what it is really it is
[27:24] this's been in it she knows the whole
[27:26] system work with work don't worry about
[27:29] God let the priest worry about God you
[27:31] know what a lot of times we do the same
[27:35] thing that's right that's right yes
[27:38] brother Dale save our children brother
[27:40] Dale teach us A good sermon come on
[27:43] brother but I'm going to go home and
[27:46] anyway hello somebody they say hello
[27:49] somebody brother Keith read I like it
[27:51] when brother Keith start doing that and
[27:53] brother dick goes hello hello somebody
[27:55] di goes hello please answer me back he
[27:58] said hello somebody so he said but
[28:03] look watch brother brand watching go to
[28:06] Matthew 24 now that's where the seals
[28:08] are right that's where the seals came
[28:09] into be he didn't say that shise false
[28:12] Jesus is right right false Christ look
[28:17] what it says no you get a Pentecostal
[28:19] that's a real Pentecostal say itself he
[28:22] is Jesus no words he said you they ain't
[28:24] going to take
[28:25] it you get a false Methodist or a
[28:27] Baptist or somebody like that or one of
[28:29] the organization say we are Jesus they
[28:31] know better than that and who's they
[28:33] Satan and his demons they know better
[28:35] than that
[28:38] right they ain't going to do that but
[28:41] the Bible said it would be false Christ
[28:44] not Jesus's but false Christ they won't
[28:47] they wouldn't recognize say I'm Jesus Oh
[28:49] No but they're false Christ and don't
[28:52] know it right because they're contrary
[28:56] to the word that's right
[28:59] if you really read anointed ones of the
[29:00] end time it'll about scare you to
[29:02] death really that how close it
[29:05] is that it's so close that it could why
[29:09] would the Bible even you know put that
[29:11] sentence in there that it could deceive
[29:13] the very if it were possible and then
[29:16] brother Rand comes through here into the
[29:17] sermon and he says but it's not
[29:19] possible but now it is possible to
[29:21] deceive this guy and go into the spirit
[29:23] realm that's right he does that every
[29:26] day that's right hello somebody he does
[29:29] that every day but he can't get to that
[29:31] soul that soul is the most important
[29:33] thing it's like brother Lis is saying
[29:35] don't worry about the man that can kill
[29:37] the body right that's right worry about
[29:39] the man that can kill the soul there's
[29:40] only one man can kill the soul and
[29:42] that's God Almighty cuz he created Soul
[29:44] Satan can't kill us all he perverts it
[29:46] so God has to kill
[29:47] it got it cuz look I would that all be
[29:53] saved Bible says Jesus Christ came to
[29:56] save everybody on the face of this Earth
[29:57] but knew who would and who wouldn't
[29:59] that's right so there's a chance there
[30:01] an opportunity right but once they turn
[30:03] it down once Satan gets them to seal
[30:06] theirself away then God can't get to
[30:09] them anymore because he has to go by his
[30:13] law yeah in the Bible That's where this
[30:16] come from that shall arise false
[30:19] Christ right false anointed ones that's
[30:22] why he talking the anointed ones at the
[30:23] end time all
[30:26] right let's see there's one more want to
[30:28] reading then
[30:29] we I want to see if anybody has any
[30:31] questions there one I was reading this
[30:32] morning right here let's
[30:34] see right
[30:39] here all right now no they wouldn't
[30:42] stand he's he's reiterating what he said
[30:44] f Jesus if they wouldn't be stand call
[30:46] Jesus certainly not that's too plain
[30:48] anybody knows that anyone know it wasn't
[30:50] Jesus I don't care they had all on their
[30:52] back and blood on their hands and up and
[30:53] down their eyes and that was going on
[30:55] during his time yeah that was a man that
[30:58] that had U he had a a bile of oil
[31:02] underneath his U thing right there and
[31:05] he would he would shake it and there
[31:07] would oil come out on his hands you
[31:09] know but now look see that to me that's
[31:13] not that deceived a few but it didn't
[31:16] deceive the real Christian that's right
[31:18] okay it didn't it didn't deceive the
[31:20] real Christian it deceived others and
[31:22] blood on their hands well that's what he
[31:24] had the guy had a bow and had some blood
[31:26] that was like right here and he would
[31:28] break it you have a little bile he'
[31:30] break it and blood would run out on the
[31:31] hand and oil on the back now he saw all
[31:34] that anybody that's got good sense no it
[31:38] wasn't Jesus they would stand for him
[31:39] but they call themselves the anointed
[31:42] and they do signs and wonders almost to
[31:44] deceive the very elect but false Christ
[31:46] anointed one shall arise and shall
[31:47] deceive the elect if it were possible
[31:50] now don't miss this statement because
[31:51] it's worthy to listen so I think we
[31:53] ought to
[31:54] listen he's putting tape on the
[31:56] microphone notice not Jesus is false
[31:58] Christ they believe they're anointed but
[32:00] they know they're not Jesus right that's
[32:03] too plain if man went up and said look
[32:05] at the scars on my hand look at my brow
[32:07] I'm Jesus well now we know that's wrong
[32:09] remember Jesus Jesus never said that
[32:11] them guys them guys would appear he said
[32:13] they would appear false Christ Christ
[32:15] plural that's right meaning
[32:19] denominations and so forth it's not just
[32:21] denominations and so forth all right
[32:25] anointed ones Anointed with the
[32:26] denominational spirit
[32:28] IR now see a denominational spirit is
[32:31] what happened back here at
[32:34] 606 was a denom what's a common
[32:36] denominator it's a division it's it's
[32:38] dividing they ought to know right off
[32:41] that the denomination was a divider
[32:44] that's right right it was a division
[32:46] right that's right and so forth but they
[32:49] were deceived anointed ones Anointed
[32:51] with the denominational spirit and not
[32:53] the word you follow it not false jesuses
[32:55] false Christ then he's talking about
[32:57] three classes of people ham sham
[33:00] which is what the believer the mate
[33:02] believer and the unbeliever
[33:06] now the
[33:08] unbeliever is the one that we were
[33:10] talking about last Sunday that they
[33:11] don't have sin they're Sinners they just
[33:14] don't believe they don't believe yeah
[33:16] right but these people right here are M
[33:18] believing they're they're believe trying
[33:20] to believe something that's that's make
[33:22] believe listen where is a father son
[33:25] Holy Ghost any kind of Doctrine right
[33:28] anywhere in God's
[33:30] word
[33:32] anywhere but that's where they find it
[33:34] at when they're make believer that's
[33:36] right where do you see that there's um a
[33:39] trinitarian Doctrine in the Bible it's
[33:41] not written there that's right but yet
[33:43] they get it out of the Bible so they're
[33:45] mate believing that it's true what's a
[33:47] mate
[33:49] believer a mate believer is an impostor
[33:52] somebody that thinks they're this but
[33:53] they're not or even trying to act like
[33:56] that's true okay but now you you got the
[33:58] True Believer that now watch now you say
[34:01] well we're going to cast these away and
[34:02] we're just going to be Believers go back
[34:04] up where it said would almost deceive
[34:06] the very elect so that that Doctrine and
[34:08] that demon is right there
[34:13] right with the believer
[34:16] right that's what false anointed
[34:19] is that's what false anointed ones is
[34:23] that's right right here with the
[34:26] Believers
[34:28] yes two spirits in the framework of what
[34:30] this church cor that's right
[34:33] yes that's why it's kind of scary but
[34:36] when you get a revelation that that
[34:38] thing I say thing that demon part of
[34:42] that doctrine that you've had
[34:45] before is going away from you right you
[34:49] better have confidence in one thing that
[34:51] God is doing something in your life okay
[34:54] that's why I think brother BR when he
[34:55] saw that when he saw that Doctrine
[34:58] unfold where he had taught many years
[35:00] that the Holy Ghost was a was a white
[35:02] horse rider when he realized that that
[35:06] God come back and gave him a
[35:09] revelation contrary to what he had okay
[35:13] M right that that was residing so close
[35:16] to that
[35:19] prophet and he sees it leave him right I
[35:24] believe i' had a shot in
[35:26] that I mean really don't you think when
[35:29] you well when you see a revelation I
[35:31] know I know some people act different
[35:34] but and it excites you but it also
[35:36] humbles you yes you know why it humbles
[35:39] you because you know one thing for sure
[35:41] it wasn't the devil that brought
[35:44] itre so brother C you know one thing if
[35:46] you get a revelation then God it's like
[35:48] Brother D always said if you get a
[35:50] revelation of what's going on just claim
[35:52] whatever say whatever you need that's
[35:54] right cuz cuz it is true it's not a
[35:57] fantasy God is so close right there amen
[36:00] right cuz if he brings a revelation like
[36:02] I said the devil has to move out of the
[36:04] way that's right devil can that's one
[36:06] thing he can't stand he can't stand the
[36:08] word that's right now he can stand all
[36:09] of our little quirky ideas and all of
[36:11] our little things we do in life he can
[36:13] he can he can stand that that's right
[36:15] but when God brings a
[36:16] revelation which is the power of the
[36:19] word he has to move out and that's what
[36:21] brother Bram he said here stands the
[36:22] Lamb with the book his hand well that
[36:24] Christ had come down
[36:27] Revelations 10:1 the mighty Angel come
[36:29] down with a book in his hand that was
[36:31] open man and it wasn't brother brandom
[36:34] he wasn't Christ he was a filter he it's
[36:38] what he said he was a trumpet what does
[36:39] a trumpet do trumpet you sit it down and
[36:41] never makes a noise that's it right it
[36:44] don't make its own noise right that's
[36:46] right right but there is a capability
[36:48] inside that trumpet to make a noise if
[36:52] the person picks it up and blows it same
[36:54] way with brother Brown he and that's our
[36:56] problem we we're not able to be a
[36:58] prophet like he's being a prophet and
[37:00] get ourselves so far out of the way till
[37:03] it's it's God just
[37:05] completely taking over what to show
[37:07] visions and to show the thoughts and
[37:10] intents of the heart I believe we can
[37:12] still do that I mean we have discernment
[37:14] we there was a guy yesterday that was
[37:17] right beside of us and he's he's a
[37:18] nominal Christian guy but he said they
[37:20] were at a festival one time they were
[37:21] kind of in a a low place and he said and
[37:25] it was supposed to go on like Saturday
[37:27] and and it was Friday night and they
[37:28] were doing good and he said something
[37:30] spoke to him and he is he's a good
[37:31] Christian guy I mean tries tried the
[37:33] best he can real humble brother and we
[37:36] met him twice we met him up here little
[37:38] but um he um he said something spoke to
[37:41] me and said get out close your stuff and
[37:45] he said it just like a man spoke right
[37:47] in my
[37:49] ear he said I didn't know nothing there
[37:51] was nothing going on there was no storm
[37:54] he told his wife he said let's pack up
[37:56] and go to a motel M so they packed up
[37:58] one the motel that night it rained like
[38:00] 4 and 1/2 in flooded the whole CGR wow
[38:04] blowed everybody's stuff down in the
[38:06] river they had left their stuff there
[38:09] blow it down in the river and it took
[38:11] them days to find the stuff wow so now
[38:13] you say well he just a no God speaks to
[38:17] the people that will listen that's right
[38:20] that's what he and he was he was
[38:21] glorifying God he wasn't glorifying
[38:22] himself he was glorifying God that God
[38:24] would speak to him and say get your
[38:26] stuff and move
[38:28] and right where he was at just went down
[38:29] the river wow and all the people that
[38:32] didn't hear from
[38:34] God they lost everything they had so you
[38:37] know thank God for that that he moves
[38:38] but now take that though and bring that
[38:40] into a higher level for you and
[38:42] I but I'd rather listen and hear it here
[38:46] right yeah
[38:47] amen yeah not just in this building you
[38:50] understand but but when we go upstairs
[38:51] and we hear God speak to us that should
[38:53] be God speaking to us resonating
[38:56] resonating every week every day just
[38:58] have little thoughts in your mind I have
[39:00] become and that is the same way he's not
[39:02] a prayer Warrior and I'm not a prayer
[39:04] Warrior he don't study seven days a week
[39:06] neither do I but I'm always thinking
[39:08] about something something's always
[39:09] coming or something will happen like
[39:11] that man that's what I thinking about
[39:12] last night that guy said that and I said
[39:14] well if you can speak to that man yes
[39:18] and give him a revelation to move then
[39:21] you can speak to me and give me a
[39:22] revelation for the people today that's
[39:24] what I was saying so he's not a
[39:25] respected person he's not
[39:27] the guy humbled himself enough to where
[39:29] that that God spoke to him and he
[39:31] listened right that's the same way with
[39:33] this you
[39:34] don't if you're an unbeliever then
[39:36] you're lost we we got to categorize this
[39:38] thing if you're an unbeliever you're
[39:40] lost that's right you need salvation
[39:45] amen you don't need to move over in here
[39:48] you move over here you're a Believer cuz
[39:52] a m believer is somebody that believes
[39:54] they got it and they don't that's fa but
[39:57] there's so close see I Satan's Satan's
[40:00] Satan's not an unbeliever no no he's not
[40:03] an unbeliever he makes people
[40:05] unbelievers that's right but he's not an
[40:07] unbeliever he's a m believer that's
[40:08] right that's right but he really
[40:10] believes he's a
[40:12] Believer he thinks he can take God some
[40:14] way and you know go around the corner
[40:17] and oh got him but he can't that's the
[40:20] that's what you and I got to realize he
[40:21] can't do it false Christ will come they
[40:24] are here now that's right yes
[40:28] been here since Paul's day that's been
[40:29] 2,000 years and they've been honing
[40:31] their skillsa right for one word off
[40:35] that's what's coming to the battle the
[40:36] battle brother rown said it's not we
[40:38] don't go to the battle of Armageddon
[40:40] right right we don't have a a mount
[40:43] trans configuration battle Jesus fought
[40:45] that out right we have a Mount Zion okay
[40:49] battle what where was Zion on top of the
[40:51] hill that's right that's where we're
[40:53] going to have to worry right here when
[40:54] we get up there to where that that um
[40:58] uh God's going to start moving and
[41:00] either you're going to move in or you're
[41:01] going to move out and I'm not saying in
[41:02] and out of a building I'm saying in or
[41:05] out that's right okay or we're going to
[41:08] start like Brother D said we'll just
[41:09] keep going by the grave uhh because we
[41:12] are
[41:14] not
[41:15] um I say not believing enough they don't
[41:18] that don't make you an unbeliever that's
[41:20] don't call yourself an unbeliever cuz
[41:21] you say well I just don't see that no
[41:23] you just don't understand it yet yes
[41:25] that's right and I always say yet I put
[41:26] a comma never put a period put a comma
[41:28] that's right put a comma that's right
[41:30] cuz brother R was talking about
[41:32] something one time he said don't put a
[41:33] period there put a comma yeah that's
[41:36] right I believe one true Living God
[41:39] comma but there's more for me to there's
[41:42] more for me to understand that's right
[41:44] cuz somebody will challenge you if you
[41:46] stand up and say I believe in one
[41:47] through and Liv of God somebody's going
[41:48] to walk up and say explain that would
[41:50] you about how that a father can talk to
[41:52] a Son and the Holy Ghost is
[41:54] overshadowing and this then you see all
[41:56] these parts going into different places
[41:58] and what are you going to
[42:00] do okay that's what I'm not asking you
[42:03] you got to ask yourself that question
[42:05] what are you going to
[42:06] do because that false Christ brother
[42:09] Brandon saw that going away on that
[42:11] first Feld now next Sunday we'll take
[42:13] the second seal but we're going to lap
[42:15] back to the first and then go a little
[42:16] bit further on to the second so read the
[42:19] second seal if you wish but read anoyed
[42:22] ones at the end time it'll really make
[42:25] you realize that you know before we
[42:28] leave it's real obvious when we do
[42:30] things wrong yes yes right we're
[42:33] condemned we feel bad we we ask for
[42:35] forgiveness or or what more but what
[42:37] about those little things that are still
[42:39] inside of us that we don't that we don't
[42:40] know is wrong
[42:42] yet yeah like brother bandam he walked
[42:45] several years with that Doctrine not in
[42:48] his soul that's right not in his soul
[42:51] okay but in his his Spirit realm that's
[42:54] right his memory takes him back to a
[42:56] mighty conqueror okay Jesus on a white
[42:59] horse and all these things and he put
[43:01] that together himself okay God didn't
[43:05] but when you come to these seals God put
[43:07] it all together yes so what did it do it
[43:10] wiped out that part okay that's why he
[43:12] was rejoicing God wiped out a part that
[43:14] had a little bitty Black Spot somewhere
[43:17] that Satan had a little bitty hold and
[43:18] then now he's gone that's what you and I
[43:20] got to work on let's go
[43:27] oh
