[17:03] just like John was on Al palas I don't
[17:05] think we've got out of it we're still in
[17:06] the day of the Lord as it was back 2,000
[17:10] years ago almost yes sir it's the same
[17:12] day of the Lord amen you love the Lord
[17:15] you may be seated for a moment we'll U
[17:18] start in with the ordination if you guys
[17:20] want to go ahead and sit down leave the
[17:22] guitar available though cuz I think
[17:23] somebody's going to need it
[17:38] I believe the Lord has set in his church
[17:43] officers um to help lead and guide uh
[17:47] this is not a oneman
[17:49] show amen right this is an organism not
[17:54] an organization we're an organism we
[17:56] have moving parts and those moving parts
[17:58] are important and to keep a church
[18:01] healthy we need
[18:02] officers
[18:04] um if you don't if you don't need
[18:06] deacons then uh why did God put them in
[18:08] the
[18:09] Bible why' God put Bish Bishops in the
[18:12] Bible why did he put all these things in
[18:13] the Bible if we're not going to need
[18:14] them but we need them they're needful so
[18:17] we are in need of as brother Bob became
[18:20] our assistant pastor there was a he um
[18:23] became inactive as a deacon and so we
[18:27] had a uh an opening and
[18:29] I had um asked Brother Anderson if he
[18:32] would consider it and he said yes and we
[18:35] um so far we checked everything out and
[18:37] I've told a few uh the other day we
[18:39] talked about it at the meeting and I'm
[18:42] going to read you the scripture and and
[18:45] do like brother Brown I'm going to read
[18:46] you something that he said which is very
[18:48] profound but in 1 Timothy 3:8 they don't
[18:51] have it up on the screen but I'm going
[18:52] to read it to you says likewise must the
[18:55] deacons be grave not double tonged not
[18:59] given to much wine not greedy of filthy
[19:02] lucer holding the mystery of the faith
[19:05] in a pure
[19:06] conscience somebody asked brother ROM a
[19:08] question one time on questions and
[19:10] answerers says and he was dealing with
[19:12] that because you know he was coming he
[19:13] was coming with new doctrine but it was
[19:15] the
[19:16] truth all right so there were some of
[19:18] those old deacons that still believed in
[19:20] the baptism Father Son and Holy Ghost
[19:21] they still believed in trinitarian cuz
[19:23] they hadn't all come into the message
[19:25] yet well they asked brother random he
[19:27] said if if the if a deacon does doesn't
[19:28] believe what the pastor says he
[19:30] shouldn't be a
[19:31] deacon cuz the Deacon supposed to be the
[19:34] policeman of the church to enforce the
[19:35] rules not make them to enforce the rules
[19:38] of the church all right so holding the
[19:41] mystery of the faith in pure conscience
[19:44] and let these also first be proved then
[19:46] let us use the office of a deacon being
[19:49] found blameless even so must their wives
[19:52] be grave not slanderous sober faithful
[19:54] in all things and we have found that
[19:57] Brother Anderson
[19:59] he's been with us for a while he's grown
[20:02] in the
[20:03] Lord uh his family's grown he's he's a
[20:06] good man of his household he takes care
[20:07] of his family his wife takes care of the
[20:10] family and and we just feel that that he
[20:13] would make a good fit and uh to be a
[20:16] deacon of the
[20:18] church now this is I'll read you this
[20:20] real quick they asked brother Brandon
[20:22] one time this is the placing of a deacon
[20:25] 1958 they said one young man that they
[20:27] found was not exactly qualified not cuz
[20:29] he wasn't the right type of
[20:33] man but he wasn't
[20:35] married a deacon must be
[20:38] married
[20:40] okay he would be he would be okay to be
[20:42] on the trustee
[20:44] board but the pastor and I came together
[20:47] and asked the age of the young man he
[20:49] was in his early 20s honorable just a
[20:52] real man but he was single the Bible
[20:54] requires a deacon to be married he must
[20:56] be the husband of one wife
[20:59] and then another man which was a very
[21:00] honorable man very qualified for the job
[21:03] that would make a loyal man a brother
[21:05] suggested him then after investigating
[21:06] the case that brother had just recently
[21:09] come to the faith so a deacon must be
[21:11] mature enough to not somebody just come
[21:13] off a street and come into the message
[21:14] of the hour and cuz you got to have
[21:17] wisdom yes right to hold the truth and
[21:20] to to hold this truth to be faithful to
[21:23] this truth and that's what a deacon
[21:25] really brother R said you know Deacon's
[21:26] got a a more stringent uh
[21:29] a requirement than a than a pastor a
[21:31] pastor doesn't have to be
[21:32] married right but a deacon does because
[21:36] the Deacon is going to have to come to
[21:38] you one day and say hey your kids are
[21:40] and he remembers how his kids are or
[21:43] were right why you got brother Ryan and
[21:46] you got now um Brother Anderson brother
[21:50] terence's kids old enough to know better
[21:51] now so that we're we're we're through
[21:54] that season of Life same with mine but I
[21:58] believe he'll be a a wonderful Deacon a
[22:00] good a good selection and I really would
[22:03] like to bring him out and this is the
[22:05] way brother Ram did it so that's way
[22:07] we're going to do it so Brother Anderson
[22:08] if you'll come up here brother Terence
[22:10] and brother um Ryan would you come up
[22:12] here please
[22:28] he dresses up pretty good
[22:30] too he has on one of he has on one of my
[22:33] dad's
[22:36] ties so if you two would stand right
[22:38] here look this way Brother Anderson you
[22:40] look toward me CU we're going to take a
[22:44] vote and it's just going to be kind of
[22:46] an informal you don't have to write it
[22:47] down but if everyone would bow their
[22:50] heads except for the two deacons beside
[22:52] me and myself is there anyone in this
[22:56] congregation would see that he would not
[22:58] make a good Deacon could you raise your
[23:01] hand at the
[23:04] moment all right if there's none then
[23:07] 100% that would be 100% vote for then
[23:11] Brother Anderson turn
[23:15] around there's your new
[23:17] Deacon we have Deacon here we have
[23:20] Deacon here we sure appreciate
[23:23] you I believe that um I believe that we
[23:26] to move move forward we got to work as a
[23:28] team and and when you have a gap you
[23:31] have to fill that Gap up and then uh did
[23:33] you get get pick okay and uh also now
[23:38] thank you buddy give
[23:40] everybody give me one
[23:49] more God bless you give him the right
[23:52] hand of Fellowship not the right foot of
[23:56] Fellowship amen

[24:03] more don't go anywhere Joe Joe we got
[24:08] one
[24:09] more yeah okay so now also we believe
[24:12] that um I believe that since brother D's
[24:16] a trustee and brother Gary's a trustee
[24:18] that we need another trustee now
[24:21] trustees are
[24:23] technically uh not voted on but we're
[24:26] going to do the same I ask brother Danny
[24:28] Fountain if he would be a trustee and he
[24:31] agreed so if you would come up here
[24:33] brother Danny trustees you can stay
[24:36] there where you see come on buddy
[24:38] brother Danny's been here a long time
[24:40] that man has
[24:40] [Music]
[24:42] grown I'm proud of him I mean he's older
[24:45] than I am but I'm still proud of
[24:47] him we ain't as old as Joy so are
[24:50] we so D brother Danny has has agreed to
[24:53] be a trustee trustees are to take care
[24:55] of the of the finances of the church
[24:58] we're going to be using that office
[25:01] because that's what brother R said we
[25:03] supposed to do all right all right I'll
[25:06] and I'll read you a little something in
[25:07] here a little bit about it but but we
[25:09] don't need to vote brother Danny is just
[25:10] a outstanding guy uh I believe he
[25:13] handles his wife F I mean his family
[25:15] fine and
[25:17] uh and he's good with his finances so we
[25:20] sure appreciate brother Dane's been
[25:21] through a lot amen he's had a lot of
[25:24] health issues and and the Lord's brought
[25:26] him out of every bit of it and he
[25:28] believes we believe in prayer CLA
[25:30] Because he believes in them stuck
[25:32] everywhere around you know all over the
[25:34] place so brother Danny proud of you bud
[25:37] I love

[26:50] answers and I
[26:52] don't I depend on people now like
[26:54] brother
[26:55] Al brother Chris Long people that have
[26:58] been on the battlefield for
[27:00] years that has years of experience in in
[27:04] in this and like I said before I don't
[27:06] talk I don't talk about you guys to
[27:08] everybody but I do don't call your name
[27:10] I don't call your name but an evangelist
[27:13] can't doesn't know what a pastor knows
[27:16] there would be no way that I could go to
[27:17] Andrew Glover and say Andrew I've got
[27:18] this problem with so well he's not a
[27:20] pastor for brother Michael he is been
[27:23] one for 40 something years so it's
[27:25] brother Chris and brother Dutch Scott
[27:26] talked to him yesterday um about a
[27:28] certain thing and and you know I depend
[27:31] on them but I depend on you guys too I
[27:33] want you to be able to chime in and and
[27:36] give your you know voice your your
[27:38] concerns yeah about all the things that
[27:40] are going on but uh I I don't want to be
[27:43] Al I'm not going to be alone I'm going
[27:44] to be we're going to be around a group
[27:46] of people that knows what they're doing
[27:48] uh like brother Mike different ones
[27:50] they're
[27:51] successful they're successful pastors I
[27:54] don't care about business and all that
[27:56] they're successful pastors they've done
[27:57] they've they went through the hardships
[27:59] they went through the ups and downs and
[28:01] I sure depend on them cuz I got them all
[28:02] on speed di brother claw and different
[28:05] ones you know that's went through this
[28:07] that I haven't went through and and I
[28:09] don't want to I told um I don't know if
[28:11] it brother Ryan or somebody I told the
[28:13] other day I said you know dad had a dad
[28:16] had a a time that he could make a
[28:18] mistake and learn and you know for 50
[28:20] years you understand what I'm saying for
[28:22] being a younger man and he could flow
[28:24] through the mistakes and be better we
[28:27] don't have that much time
[28:30] we don't have that much time I don't
[28:32] want to make a mistake that that'll cost
[28:34] us spiritually or financially and then
[28:38] it then it take us 10 years to get it
[28:40] back there's not 10 years to get it back
[28:42] right if if God said he'd do a short
[28:45] quick work then he means he'll do it
[28:47] through
[28:48] us so I want you to be the spiritually
[28:50] minded people I want I want you to be
[28:52] able to be spiritually minded enough to
[28:54] say hey let's talk about this thing or
[28:57] let's let's this is is going in another
[28:58] Direction let's look at this but I
[29:00] really want us to look at that down the
[29:02] road I like I said we don't have time to
[29:06] Fumble
[29:07] around we we we ain't got we ain't got
[29:09] but man I'm telling you you look what's
[29:11] going on with
[29:13] politics and if and and you know Trump
[29:16] may be your man which is fine the other
[29:18] one
[29:19] ain't but just think about what brother
[29:21] Mike he said Constantine did the same
[29:25] thing he put church and state together
[29:27] called is self
[29:30] religious I guess this is on the
[29:32] internet but Donald Trump ain't a
[29:33] Christian that's right said he he's not
[29:38] he is not at
[29:41] all
[29:43] okay so why are we depending on him to
[29:46] get us out of here with but the nominal
[29:48] people will because they got that pull
[29:50] of that feeling of the even the foolish
[29:52] virgins going to be fooled I don't know
[29:54] why I'm preaching fooled because of that
[29:57] they're fool foolish virgins you and I
[30:00] are not foolish virgins we're wise
[30:03] virgins we're wise to the things of the
[30:05] world and wise and sure we watch the
[30:07] political scene and sure we watch all
[30:09] these things but we watch them we don't
[30:12] get involved in them right but you just
[30:15] watch this thing and watch this thing
[30:16] coming up you look at the stock market
[30:18] it lost a lot of money the other day
[30:21] it's getting ready to hit the
[30:23] bottom and you know I ain't making no
[30:25] predictions but usually October is the
[30:27] time the crash comes so maybe this year
[30:29] maybe next year but it lost like $1
[30:31] trillion dollar the other day in one
[30:33] day that a bother me cuz I didn't have
[30:36] nothing in it brother Donnie said I
[30:39] don't even know what went
[30:41] on but somebody's pension got knocked
[30:43] down some so you know but that look one
[30:46] day that morning stock market opened the
[30:49] day they CL the same day it closed as
[30:51] 1.7 trillion had been lost worldwide
[30:55] worldwide not in United States but
[30:56] worldwide just just because why somebody
[30:59] was watching the Monitor and saw stuff
[31:02] going up and down and got panicked and
[31:04] started selling and all you know how
[31:05] that all works but it's coming today
[31:07] folks we're going to have to trust in
[31:08] God more and more trust with trust each
[31:11] other more and
[31:12] more bind closer together more and more
[31:15] that's why I like to have a a team of
[31:16] people here that can uh can do what
[31:20] needs to be done now brother rown watch
[31:21] this he said
[31:24] look and that's what taken place this is
[31:26] in 1959 a super super sense and we'll
[31:28] call Brother George out let him sing a
[31:30] song and that's what taking place here
[31:33] with tonight with the brother Morgan
[31:34] brother William Morgan resigned as a
[31:36] trustee they needed another trustee and
[31:38] brother s was appointed that's why I
[31:39] said it's appointed as a trustee now
[31:42] watch he said it's official as long as
[31:44] the church in our church it's the
[31:47] sovereignty of the
[31:49] church the church moves or puts in
[31:51] trustees the church moves the pastor or
[31:54] puts in the pastor whatever it is it's
[31:56] the church in all that's
[31:58] Apostolic that's the way it has did in
[32:01] Bible times therefore we feel that no
[32:03] one person then is a dictator or
[32:06] something in the church we don't want
[32:08] that every man every person myself in
[32:10] voting in anyone you just got one vote
[32:14] right
[32:15] right and really I don't vote until
[32:18] there's a tie and then my vote would be
[32:20] the counted but other than that it won't
[32:22] be just one vote it isn't what I say
[32:26] it's what the church says what the
[32:28] church says in the body he said you like
[32:30] that oh yes I think that's very
[32:31] scriptural that's the way it should be
[32:34] done that was super s
[32:37] 1959 so we're going to stand to our feet
[32:39] we'll get brother George to come if uh
[32:42] sister EST would you just come and play
[32:45] uh Open the Eyes of our heart and we
[32:46] won't have to have all the musicians
[32:48] back up here we can listen to your
[32:50] beautiful plan all by
[32:54] yourself but you love the
[32:56] Lord I love brother George he's got he's
[32:59] got good him and brother Keith read too
[33:01] brother Keith had a lot of good thing
[33:02] points to bring out and it's just the
[33:04] wisdom of these people over the years
[33:06] that we all need to depend on amen amen
[33:09] seek counsel the Bible says seek
[33:12] counsel so that you can do what you need
[33:14] to do so let's sing Open the Eyes of My
[33:16] Heart as brother George comes speak to

[35:29] you'll tell you hard to mix see amen God
[35:33] bless you you may be seated praise God
[35:36] and um amen where this where this came
[35:40] from was um um when we had one of the
[35:44] sisters that go to another church but
[35:46] she she visited us she would have been
[35:48] here uh in our September meetings but
[35:51] she died of cancer and she was young and
[35:54] she was a real lovely sister a real real
[35:56] Christian real real faith and just it
[36:00] was her time to go amen that's all about
[36:02] it and I mean I'm sure you know the
[36:05] story about the little girl that died
[36:07] and brother Bram said God owes me an
[36:09] explanation but God doesn't owe you an
[36:11] explanation you don't and uh and then
[36:14] when he found out uh uh she was only 21
[36:17] or something and he found out that when
[36:19] she was two they were out camping
[36:21] somewhere and she fell into the river
[36:23] and and and the anel said brother BR
[36:24] that was her time to go right but but
[36:26] God spared her you got another 18 19 20
[36:29] years it so God works his own own
[36:31] patterns and his own own will and um we
[36:34] were certainly we went up to the funeral
[36:37] and we were certainly uh Missing offer
[36:39] but uh just before uh that I was up
[36:44] speaking for them and she she' passed
[36:46] away and um her mother's still there her
[36:49] brother's still there her husband's
[36:50] still there and and the daughter amen

[41:55] I looked up for um when the sister where
[41:58] are you that came with the Redemption
[41:59] him where are you there you are okay so
[42:02] I found that other song Amen and uh
[42:05] praise the Lord uh we were looking at
[42:08] the H Redemption and some of the the
[42:09] quotes we got from it this morning some
[42:11] of the hymns we mentioned uh but there
[42:14] was another little one that I love
[42:15] haven't got the words for it so I'm not
[42:17] going to play it but I'll tell you what
[42:18] when I was in India amen um uh I sang it
[42:23] with uh the pastor's daughter and we go
[42:25] back a long ways she was only born and I
[42:28] got the photograph over in Ireland 22
[42:31] years ago and we had the joy of of being
[42:35] a a help to her in her spiritual journey
[42:38] and uh Amen to see uh her dedication
[42:41] which I dedicated her to the Lord and
[42:44] here I am up on the platform of her
[42:46] singing amen uh come thy found of every
[42:52] blessing to what is that
[42:55] hungry Hearts you know beautiful song
[42:58] Amen and uh praise God uh the the the
[43:01] verse that I can remember most which is
[43:03] it's a uh think the third one it said
[43:07] prone to
[43:08] wonder Lord I feel it prone to leave the
[43:14] one I
[43:16] love take my heart dear Lord and see it
[43:22] seal it from thy courts above then
[43:27] there's another piece but that's all I
[43:28] could remember in my memory today and
[43:30] that's youve got that come th F of Every
[43:33] Blessing well thank you it's been a real
[43:35] joy to be here and it means all the
[43:37] world to me praise God much else doesn't
[43:41] uh apply anymore I just come for the
[43:44] people amen and uh for to be with the
[43:47] bread of Jesus Christ and I'm so glad to
[43:50] be here with with you today amen that's
[43:53] that's the lord it's just the Lord amen
[43:56] and you know when when you're when
[43:58] you're there and you feel that it's just
[44:02] where God wants you to be that's very
[44:04] important amen because I would not like
[44:06] to be on the mission field if God did
[44:08] not want me to be there you know Sister
[44:11] Jun so you really wouldn't want to do
[44:13] that amen and uh praise God my little uh
[44:17] tablet I I I just on the Hub I need a
[44:20] little bit of an adjustment with it to
[44:22] get to get the the the writing up again
[44:24] to me but I've got this all in print
[44:25] anyway so um praise the Lord um you
[44:30] remember this story brother Bram told
[44:32] where he was going through the the the
[44:34] forest and uh he looked down and he
[44:37] always said maybe he'd see sometimes a
[44:39] whiskey bottle or some somebody been out
[44:40] having a party and but this day he
[44:42] looked down and he seen someone had been
[44:44] smoking their carton of cigarettes you
[44:45] know I was telling brother Mark up there
[44:47] in uh Pilot Mountain if they've got the
[44:50] marathon uh gas station and it says up
[44:53] there you know a wow wow two packs of
[44:56] cart whatever I can't remember what it
[44:58] called two packs save
[45:02] $180 wow wow Save $180 I mean just kill
[45:07] yourself but you'll save
[45:08] $180 you know amen I I I I thank God you
[45:12] know I thank God that we're all
[45:14] delivered here hallelujah I tell you
[45:16] what if there was one person in here
[45:18] that would even think of smoking I tell
[45:20] you you get it right up here and we'll
[45:21] pray that off you amen we'll pray that
[45:24] off you sure would praise the Lord amen
[45:27] so um this is where this this message
[45:29] actually came from because he picked up
[45:31] that Carton and it says um you know a
[45:33] thinking man's filter and a holy man's
[45:36] taste and brother Brandon preached that
[45:37] as you know a thinking man's filter and
[45:40] a holy man's taste the word of God so we
[45:43] we we love that message amen and this
[45:45] this message is not that but it was
[45:47] something similar amen I don't know
[45:50] where I got it but I got it somewhere
[45:52] where I was I I looked I was looking at
[45:55] something or something come up and was
[45:57] about a man who was a fraudster a
[45:59] fraudster he really could Rob people of
[46:02] their money but not with a gun but with
[46:04] his tongue amen that would he rob them
[46:07] with their tongue and uh he just made
[46:09] people believe him like whatever he
[46:11] would say the way he just put it over it
[46:13] was so like the gospel truth you know
[46:15] they would do it you see and uh so uh
[46:18] sometimes he said he was a pilot and
[46:20] people believed him he was a pilot
[46:21] probably couldn't even flly playing and
[46:23] and and and other times he was a
[46:25] professional footballer you know and
[46:27] he's telling people and they would go
[46:28] for all this you know they'd go for all
[46:30] that there and he kept what you have to
[46:33] do you have to keep reinvented that's
[46:36] what the thing with science amen I I I
[46:38] preached a series brother we about
[46:41] before the beginning when there was
[46:44] nothing amen there was brother bam said
[46:46] there was nothing not an angel not a
[46:48] of nothing under H to know that
[46:51] there had to be something to tell us
[46:53] there was nothing amen and I'll tell you
[46:55] what and and there was something there
[46:58] which was eternal because everything
[47:01] that was created had to have a Creator
[47:04] amen so there was something greater an
[47:07] eternal spirit that had in all his mind
[47:10] what he wanted to do and he done it
[47:12] Hallelujah and praise God ear nothing he
[47:14] made something Hallelujah and so we're
[47:17] so thankful to that today that uh for
[47:20] for our young people and then of course
[47:23] at the beginning where uh he spoke the
[47:25] word in the beginning God
[47:27] amen I said and and and and let there be
[47:30] light and he spoke the word that's the
[47:32] highest form of faith and he believed
[47:35] his own word brother Bram said and and
[47:37] praise God as a wonderful thing to do
[47:39] amen and sometimes I've had the thing
[47:42] happen to me myself where you've you've
[47:43] said something and you say oh what did I
[47:45] say that for but you know you watch it
[47:47] and see how it comes out and and it was
[47:49] just it was just the Lord amen and so
[47:52] anyway so this this man amen um uh
[47:56] praise the Lord Lord he uh he kept
[47:58] Reinventing himself and uh continually
[48:01] deceiving people and of course he was
[48:03] making a killing out of it all and uh he
[48:05] was what you call a a proverbial or a
[48:09] professional liar he could lie but you
[48:11] know brother Bram said and it's true
[48:13] what he said he said always tell the
[48:15] truth because you don't have to change
[48:17] it you don't have to change it lies you
[48:20] do you're going to have to reinvent
[48:22] that's what I was talking about s
[48:23] they're they're always Reinventing their
[48:25] Theory oh no we don't believe that
[48:27] anymore but yeah this is what we and
[48:29] they're going and they're going and
[48:30] they're going and they still don't know
[48:31] where they're going amen all right but
[48:33] we do praise God it's brother we had
[48:35] said that am mean he mentioned truth a
[48:37] number of times there when he was
[48:38] speaking Hallelujah and so here he was
[48:41] and he defrauded people out of their
[48:43] savings and amen wow his whole his whole
[48:46] life as the story went and it's a true
[48:49] story his whole life was based on lies
[48:52] am mean I know another person whose
[48:53] whole life is based on lives has whole
[48:55] being amen and praise God uh you know so
[48:59] when your Life's a lie like that and
[49:00] you're defrauding people something
[49:02] happens sometimes where you're Reed in
[49:05] and you go to the court Hallelujah and
[49:08] uh praise God so it came to light it
[49:10] came to light and uh so uh when they
[49:13] were having the trial uh the prosecu and
[49:16] solicitor amen said about him he said he
[49:20] has no basis of truth from which he
[49:24] operates right so there he was doing
[49:26] doing what he was doing but he had no
[49:28] basis of Truth to to to to to from which
[49:31] he operates and I was thinking about
[49:34] that I said my Lord that's wonderful you
[49:36] need a basis of truth from which they
[49:38] Alit Hallelujah you don't you can't
[49:41] build on a lie amen you have to have a
[49:43] basis of truth from which you operate
[49:46] amen and this is where I got that praise
[49:48] God and and praise the Lord maybe
[49:50] there'll be uh just but let's pray just
[49:53] before we do speak and you can just be
[49:54] seated it's fine Hallelujah Lord Jesus
[49:57] we just thank you for this day Lord as
[49:59] the Pastor said amen it's just not 24
[50:02] hours it's the day of the Lord
[50:04] hallelujah the Lord's day amen and we're
[50:07] living in that in in that time lord and
[50:09] dear God we just pray father today that
[50:12] Lord uh or we go home to our own places
[50:15] that Lord you will speak another little
[50:17] word father that it'll all come together
[50:19] and Lord that you will just bless it to
[50:21] the people and Lord may we all get
[50:23] something from it today Lord from your
[50:25] from your wonderful uh uh amen table
[50:28] Lord we pray it in Jesus Christ's name
[50:31] today take full control do what you want
[50:34] Lord and father God we give it all to
[50:36] you and we give the glory to Jesus amen
[50:38] and amen praise God so Hallelujah when I
[50:42] was thinking this amen um where your
[50:46] treasure is there will your heart be
[50:48] also that's very very true amen very
[50:51] true and so what we classified or what
[50:53] we call the message was freedom and
[50:56] Truth amen freedom and Truth amen so
[50:59] this guy didn't have that his whole life
[51:00] was based on a lie now that's a strange
[51:03] thing because I I'm sure if I said you
[51:06] does anybody here know like a habital
[51:08] liar I'm sure somewhere between you were
[51:11] a kid and going to school and all that
[51:13] I'm sure you met somebody somewhere
[51:15] where you could say right that's them
[51:18] and and and I certainly can there used
[51:20] to be a boy in our Factory and honestly
[51:23] he could tell you a story you wouldn't
[51:25] believe it or you would believe you know
[51:27] he always had a story to tell and so
[51:30] praise God it went back to you know
[51:33] brother Bram says and and situations
[51:35] like that there was a point in his life
[51:37] when it happened there's always a point
[51:39] if you sometimes people went off the
[51:41] rails and you could actually go back to
[51:43] a point like the like the the girl that
[51:45] the brother Bram talked about and she
[51:47] had been delivered and then she's G past
[51:48] the the the dance hall and she stopped
[51:51] she shouldn't have stopped Hallelujah
[51:52] she should have just walked on Amen
[51:54] praise God that's my old life I'm not
[51:56] there anymore I'm a new creation
[51:58] Hallelujah and so anyway uh he he uh
[52:02] even when he was a child he was always
[52:04] lit for school and so amen the teacher
[52:08] would call him out amen and she'd call
[52:11] him out out by name Michael Michael come
[52:13] out to the front and so he come out says
[52:15] you're lit again like what why are you
[52:18] lit oh miss miss all all the all the
[52:20] Sheep were Ling last night me and Daddy
[52:23] was up to 4:00 and all this he was a
[52:25] liar and wonder nothing was happening at
[52:28] all but that was a story Hallelujah and
[52:31] that's what happens folks and the
[52:33] devil's like that the devil you got to
[52:36] when you realize that the devil when he
[52:39] speaks I preach the message on what the
[52:42] devil has to say and you take it the
[52:44] whole way through the Bible when he
[52:45] speaks and he's a liar hallelujah praise
[52:48] God he's just a liar amen so even bam
[52:51] and looking down at Israel said they
[52:52] couldn't be the people of God look at
[52:54] them all that carnality he's fire
[52:56] hallelujah hallelujah Moses and that
[52:59] group had the the sh of the king and the
[53:02] camp they had all the the Tabernacle up
[53:04] there and we're walking with God Amen
[53:07] and so praise the Lord that's the truth
[53:09] now so amen uh truth is a very important
[53:12] thing praise the Lord and actually our
[53:15] study is to bring out aspects important
[53:18] aspects of Truth amen because the way I
[53:21] would put it like this that each time it
[53:24] talks about truth in your Bible it can
[53:25] actually mean something a little bit
[53:27] different there's different aspects of
[53:28] Truth and you'll get to see that I hope
[53:30] let me see about five just after after
[53:33] okay praise God Amen so it's very
[53:35] important amen and uh uh amen like our
[53:38] reading Amen in John 8 and 31 let's see
[53:41] what it says said then said Jesus to
[53:44] those Jews which believed on him they
[53:45] were Believers if you continue in my
[53:48] word then you are my disciples indeed
[53:51] and ye shall know the truth and the
[53:54] truth will make you free Hallelujah so
[53:57] we're a free people we're in Liberty
[53:59] today amen and you shall know the truth
[54:02] and that truth will set you free praise
[54:04] God and and so that's where we are today
[54:06] hallelujah amen and uh praise God he
[54:09] says uh Jesus answered amen verse 34 he
[54:13] said Jesus answered uh truly truly or
[54:15] verily verily I say unto you whosoever
[54:18] committeth sin is the servant of sin and
[54:20] the servant abideth not in the house
[54:23] forever but the son abideth forever he
[54:26] says if the son therefore make you free
[54:29] you will be free indeed Hallelujah so
[54:32] thank God uh you know uh there was
[54:35] people in brother branham's day sitting
[54:37] at a table a breakfast table and brother
[54:39] Bram was having a little talk afterward
[54:41] and the next thing is he' say something
[54:43] maybe 13 people get up and walked out
[54:45] all from one denomination because he
[54:47] they he said something that they didn't
[54:49] agree with oh my my my my my so praise
[54:53] God you'll know the truth and the sun
[54:54] shall make you free and I'll tell you
[54:56] what we don't need any denominational uh
[54:59] like uh I've I've been in churches like
[55:01] that even Pentecostal churches where
[55:03] they would put up a big thing at the
[55:05] outside there and we believe this we
[55:07] believe that we believe in the Trinity
[55:09] and they'll give you all the reasons we
[55:10] believe in speaking in tongues as the
[55:12] evidence of the the baptism of the Holy
[55:14] Ghost well you ought to go to Africa and
[55:17] see some of them people you know dancing
[55:19] and and speaking in tongues and say oh
[55:21] they must have the Holy Ghost there amen
[55:23] you got to qualify things like that and
[55:25] you can't just tell people uh that that
[55:27] that said praise the Lord amen and we're
[55:30] certainly not against speaking in
[55:31] tongues you know that but I'll tell you
[55:33] what praise God certainly not but Amen
[55:35] to say that's a witness amen uh the Holy
[55:38] Ghost would fall Upon A group of people
[55:40] some people could speak in tongues may
[55:41] we never do it again in their life but I
[55:43] don't mean to say they've got the holy
[55:44] ghost that reinfor in the just on the
[55:46] unjust so amen and praise God and uh
[55:50] amen he goes on to say in verse 44 I
[55:52] don't know if it'll come up what it does
[55:54] but he said you are your father that
[55:56] devil and the lust of your father you
[55:58] will do he's talking to the Pharisees
[56:00] and he says he was a murderer from the
[56:03] beginning now where have you ever heard
[56:05] anybody telling us about serpent seed
[56:08] yeah where the Bri's the only ones that
[56:10] I know that really believe that amen and
[56:13] praise God it's the truth hallelujah
[56:15] it's the truth amen and and he was a
[56:17] murderer from the beginning I mean the
[56:19] serpent had to get that Spirit of murder
[56:21] from somebody and he got it from the
[56:22] devil praise God and he killed evil amen
[56:26] and so it says uh uh amen and he Abode
[56:30] not in the truth he abod not in the
[56:33] truth amen why because there is no truth
[56:37] in him amen hallelujah there is no truth
[56:41] had to had to take a notice of what he
[56:43] said about this coming election amen
[56:45] just there praise God you know I mean
[56:47] really if you believe Donald Trump as a
[56:49] Christian well you want to go and meet
[56:51] him then and you find out that he's find
[56:53] out that he's not you know you see them
[56:55] them kind of people have to be all
[56:56] things to all men that's right but thank
[56:58] God when he stands for Israel I say amen
[57:01] hallelujah He he'll not let Iran set up
[57:03] their missiles you know on the West Bank
[57:06] so as they can blow Israel apart they
[57:08] not going to let that and they won't let
[57:09] it happen either and so amen it says
[57:12] there b nothing the truth there's no
[57:13] truth in him when he speaketh now think
[57:16] about this young people all of us when
[57:18] he speaketh he speaketh a lie he is
[57:22] incapable of telling you the truth a
[57:24] professional liar bet a liar cannot tell
[57:28] you the truth they don't even know the
[57:30] truth as a matter of fact you get to the
[57:32] place and that's where the devil is
[57:34] today you get to the place where you
[57:37] believe what you're saying is the truth
[57:39] and yet of all us a darn right lie but
[57:41] you believe it's the
[57:42] truth you know if you had an interview
[57:44] with the devil and and asked him do you
[57:46] really believe that the bread's going to
[57:48] have a a Rapture he' probably say yes
[57:50] but we'll stop it or something like that
[57:52] because he's a liar he's a liar amen and
[57:55] thank God we need advice uh we certainly
[57:58] don't go to him to ask for it I'll tell
[57:59] you that amen and he's the father of
[58:02] Lies amen and that's why I hate to when
[58:05] I I've heard some talk with young people
[58:08] or whatever not you know and they've
[58:09] been listening to the devil you know oh
[58:11] God doesn't love you you only think he
[58:13] loves you and he'll lay it on like a
[58:14] real thick amen and he'll give you all
[58:17] these reasons why you know that God
[58:19] doesn't love you praise God he'll give
[58:21] you many reasons and yet you'd be going
[58:23] onto word you'd be have to go on word to
[58:26] believe that amen for God does love us
[58:29] and and you know he he doesn't forget us
[58:31] hallelujah amen he will never forget us
[58:34] amen and so hallelujah amen and then
[58:37] Jesus said to them he said uh and
[58:39] because I tell you the truth you believe
[58:41] me not which of you convince of me or
[58:44] convict of me of sin as if I say the
[58:48] truth why do you not believe me amen why
[58:51] do you not believe me now let's really
[58:53] go into this here hallelujah truth amen
[58:57] like our reading we you shall know the
[58:59] truth the truth shall make you free the
[59:00] word is used uh it's a it's a Greek word
[59:04] uh
[59:05] ala ala that's as much as I'm going to
[59:07] say about it but that's the word I'm
[59:09] going to use amen and that's what it
[59:11] means right there when it says you shall
[59:13] know the truth and the truth will make
[59:14] you free amen that Al it's a noun a noun
[59:18] is a person a place or a thing
[59:20] Hallelujah so that's what a known is
[59:23] very important and basically it means
[59:26] the reality the reality lying at the
[59:29] basis of the appearance amen now the
[59:32] real that that word you you look it up
[59:34] in Greek that's the reality lying at the
[59:38] basis of appearance now what does that
[59:40] mean in plain English or simple English
[59:42] amen just you take about like the pillar
[59:44] of fire well thank god we've got the
[59:46] we've got the photographs of it
[59:48] Hallelujah and and and and and and
[59:50] testify of that amen and so what is the
[59:53] reality of the basis of what appear
[59:56] years it's the truth amen it's the truth
[59:59] hallelujah it really happened amen
[1:00:02] praise God and I I I I later on I'll go
[1:00:04] into another little aspect and and we'll
[1:00:07] look at we'll look at that as well amen
[1:00:09] and uh praise God it's that's a good
[1:00:11] example the light was caught on the
[1:00:15] camera a camera can only take the light
[1:00:17] that it sees but this light was with it
[1:00:20] Hallelujah and so we know that and we
[1:00:22] know that the examination and I couldn't
[1:00:24] care less because I know that anybody's
[1:00:26] going to question that amen they are not
[1:00:29] going to be uh for it amen if they're
[1:00:32] questioning it they're not going to be
[1:00:33] for it and we know exactly what was done
[1:00:36] then nobody ever questioned that nobody
[1:00:38] when all around the world Hallelujah
[1:00:40] with the Full Gospel Busom as men and
[1:00:42] everything and and and we ac we accepted
[1:00:45] it then and we accepted George D lissy's
[1:00:48] thing on it so it's the truth hallelujah
[1:00:51] because that is uh that is the the the
[1:00:54] the the reality lying at the basis of
[1:00:56] the appearing amen so praise God and
[1:00:59] that's wonderful amen and uh that was a
[1:01:01] reality and it's the truth and and and
[1:01:04] may I say that if I spoke of the
[1:01:06] Miracles of our Lord Jesus like he
[1:01:08] performed like feeding the 5,000 amen
[1:01:12] and you and I know amen that's nothing
[1:01:14] to him praise God if there had been
[1:01:16] 10,000 people there that day they would
[1:01:18] all got fed Hallelujah and I love when I
[1:01:20] was in Israel because I tell you you'll
[1:01:23] never do God I don't care what way you
[1:01:26] want it you'll never right do them and
[1:01:28] when I was over in Israel with my wife
[1:01:30] and we went up to where that place is
[1:01:32] where the 5,000 were fed and um amen it
[1:01:35] was cooked it was cooked meat it was
[1:01:36] cooked bread cooked fish Hallelujah and
[1:01:40] uh on the movie there you know Jesus of
[1:01:42] Nazareth they were all big things of raw
[1:01:45] fish you know well nobody's going to eat
[1:01:47] that Hallelujah it was cooked bread as
[1:01:49] the little boy had for his lunch it was
[1:01:51] cooked fish amen now I guarantee you if
[1:01:55] you you were uh eating that amen we had
[1:02:00] our drinks today if you were just eating
[1:02:02] cooked bread and cooked fish you'd be
[1:02:05] thirsty and you say well he doesn't care
[1:02:08] we we've had a good food you know so he
[1:02:11] does care because when we got there we
[1:02:14] found that this is the fountain the
[1:02:16] seven fountains Hallelujah right there
[1:02:19] with that happened there was seven
[1:02:22] fountains Hallelujah and I said my said
[1:02:24] to my wife look at that look at that he
[1:02:27] provided water for them to drink after
[1:02:28] they had the fish and the
[1:02:30] bread Jehovah jar Jehovah jar all the
[1:02:33] time amen so praise God and you look at
[1:02:36] that amen what is it what is the reality
[1:02:39] lying at the basis of what you see
[1:02:42] praise God you know I said at one time
[1:02:44] that you know maybe if some of them phes
[1:02:46] had been looking over at that and said H
[1:02:48] I wonder how what kind of a magician
[1:02:51] trick is that there that he's trying to
[1:02:52] do that praise God but God doesn't
[1:02:54] operate with people like that Hallelujah
[1:02:56] you got to accept it by faith and what
[1:02:58] you get is real it's the truth
[1:03:00] hallelujah amen you could ask any of
[1:03:02] them people they made know all could
[1:03:05] tell you well he prayed for it that's
[1:03:06] all I know and it came to me and we had
[1:03:08] it we had a good we had a good lunch you
[1:03:10] know yeah and then we had the water to
[1:03:11] drink you know so praise God hallelujah
[1:03:14] that's the way it is amen and you could
[1:03:16] look at any of his stories amen uh the
[1:03:18] truth of Walking On The Water see what
[1:03:21] is the reality lying at the basis of
[1:03:23] what you see that's the truth he's
[1:03:25] walking on the water Hallelujah you know
[1:03:27] you and I know that he could do that
[1:03:29] Hallelujah and he did do it Hallelujah
[1:03:31] so praise God that was the basis of
[1:03:33] reality amen of verity or truth what is
[1:03:37] true in any matter under consideration
[1:03:41] praise God now you can look at your own
[1:03:42] life as as brother Ryan did this morning
[1:03:44] look at the little things and and really
[1:03:46] to know it's true Hallelujah it has to
[1:03:49] come into that word amen what is true in
[1:03:52] any matter under consideration
[1:03:55] Hallelujah so so that's very important
[1:03:57] amen remember when brother branam was
[1:04:01] talking there he went down to the right
[1:04:03] family and amen um this is uh what is
[1:04:08] true okay in any matter under
[1:04:10] consideration and there he was at their
[1:04:13] home and he spoke of the squirrels being
[1:04:15] created amen and that's a wonderful
[1:04:17] thing and he he was lifting up his hands
[1:04:21] like as if to to to show how he was
[1:04:23] shooting at it and he could shoot it
[1:04:25] right in the left die he was a marksman
[1:04:27] amen and uh and little how spoke up she
[1:04:30] said that's nothing but the truth amen
[1:04:34] well there you are you see what what is
[1:04:36] uh amen uh the the the the basis anim
[1:04:40] what is true and aner so we're talking
[1:04:42] about squirrels hallelujah what is true
[1:04:45] about that Hallelujah is that it
[1:04:46] actually happened it actually happened
[1:04:49] that's is true about it and and and I I
[1:04:51] think I told you before that when
[1:04:53] brother Chris was over from Scotland
[1:04:55] amen he went to Charlie Cox and they
[1:04:58] were just having fellowship and talking
[1:05:00] and and Charlie said you know them
[1:05:02] squirrels we at them that night okay but
[1:05:04] he said you know them squirrels didn't
[1:05:07] have a belly button they didn't have a
[1:05:09] belly button see now that that is what
[1:05:12] what she said that's the truth they
[1:05:14] didn't have a belly button they were
[1:05:15] spoken word creation that's as simple as
[1:05:18] that they didn't have a mama father see
[1:05:21] so so it's wonderful Hallelujah and and
[1:05:23] and what is true or truth in any matter
[1:05:27] under consideration amen and uh praise
[1:05:30] the Lord and of course the holy said
[1:05:32] spirit said to him give her what you
[1:05:33] wants you know you when you come and
[1:05:36] speak to God Like That by faith

[1:08:51] says who changed the truth of God into a
[1:08:53] lie and worshiped and serve the creature
[1:08:56] more than the Creator who is the blessed
[1:08:58] and forever amen now the truth of God

[1:09:04] concerning God or God whose existence is
[1:09:09] true amen that's what it could really
[1:09:11] and they've turned that into a lie well

[1:14:41] sincere man a sincere man a genuine man

[1:14:47] what he's asked to do by the grace of
[1:14:50] God Amen and and and we had a we had a a

[1:15:10] I got the tank all open you know and um
[1:15:13] I remember when we opened that tank and
[1:15:16] uh we were kind of scooping out the big
[1:15:18] digger was scooping it so this guy you
[1:15:20] know he was like a kind of smart like
[1:15:22] bird and he he knew what I was doing he
[1:15:25] knew what I wanted so I went over to him
[1:15:27] you know this big grin on his face and
[1:15:28] he's he's digging this big hole out
[1:15:30] right in front of where the pup was
[1:15:32] going to be and uh I said to him hey and
[1:15:35] what what I said you just man your own
[1:15:38] business and keep digging and I'll tell
[1:15:40] you when to stop Hallelujah he knew
[1:15:42] friend well we were going to put a
[1:15:43] baptismal tank in there and we did and
[1:15:45] the only thing is it's so deep down that
[1:15:47] we we we couldn't get it an actual um uh
[1:15:50] pipe out so we could amply it easy so
[1:15:53] what I have to do is I got my little
[1:15:54] pump and we pump it out and then we get
[1:15:56] it all freshed up again it's quite a
[1:15:58] little work for me and amen and getting
[1:16:00] out at the very end you got to scoop it
[1:16:02] out with the water H uh and and I did
[1:16:04] that got all the lovely fresh water in
[1:16:06] and the girls came down and they uh
[1:16:09] would come come dressed ready for the
[1:16:11] baptism so we had uh them from Dublin uh
[1:16:14] the pastor his daughters got baptized
[1:16:17] and then these two girls from letter
[1:16:18] Kenny the nigan girls are Nigeria and uh
[1:16:23] what I liked about them was was the
[1:16:26] sincerity then them girls you could even
[1:16:28] see it if if you looked on the the
[1:16:30] photographs we took you can see the
[1:16:31] sincerity am amen and that means
[1:16:34] everything and praise God they were
[1:16:36] really serious and I said to them look I
[1:16:38] I'll never I'll never force you to do it
[1:16:40] it's not in my agenda uh when God tells
[1:16:43] you to do it and the mother said brother
[1:16:45] George they've been talking about it for
[1:16:46] months now amen I said okay they're
[1:16:49] ready then we'll do it and we did it and
[1:16:51] I saw two sincere girls amen abula and
[1:16:54] Grace and they got baptized and it was
[1:16:56] wonderful day and I could see the
[1:16:58] sincerity of their hearts right there in
[1:17:00] that tank amen as each one got in and
[1:17:02] was baptized and and as I'm saying
[1:17:05] sometimes you say things that you and
[1:17:07] and there I was speaking to uh the
[1:17:09] parents from the the platform there from
[1:17:11] behind the pulpit and I said you know
[1:17:13] something a sister toyan brother P the
[1:17:15] father was there I said these girls will
[1:17:17] never give you a de's problem in their
[1:17:19] life that's what I said to her I said
[1:17:22] you watch and see if that's not true
[1:17:24] because they were their rage
[1:17:26] tenderhearted so receiving the Lord and
[1:17:29] getting baptized and amen and that's the
[1:17:31] truth praise God so that's going to be
[1:17:33] the way it'll be amen and uh Hallelujah
[1:17:36] so it's wonderful to be guided into all
[1:17:38] truth as the Pastor said today praise
[1:17:40] God we need help we're not a one man ban
[1:17:42] you know uh you know at that we we we
[1:17:44] need we need help Hallelujah and uh
[1:17:47] praise God in Ephesians it says if so be
[1:17:50] that ye heard of him and have been
[1:17:52] taught by him as the truth is in Jesus
[1:17:54] amen or you could read that even as
[1:17:57] truth is in Jesus cuz he is the truth
[1:17:59] and and that meaning is not merely an
[1:18:02] ethical thing amen but uh but it is in
[1:18:06] all its fullness and scope that's truth
[1:18:09] embodied in him amen praise God the
[1:18:11] truth that's what it really means
[1:18:13] hallelujah amen he was that perfect
[1:18:16] expression well it's true and you know I
[1:18:19] was I was reading I started off in
[1:18:21] Genesis and my I got going in Genesis
[1:18:23] and when I got to the book of Exodus had
[1:18:25] a new brother B them like that get on to
[1:18:27] the Book of Exodus excuse me would you
[1:18:30] bring us that water thanks milon and so
[1:18:33] I get into the book of Exodus and uh
[1:18:36] kept reading the way through the Old
[1:18:38] Testament thank you very much praise God
[1:18:41] God bless you forgot to bring it out
[1:18:46] amen yeah amen that's good and so um
[1:18:50] when I when I I was reading Ezekiel and
[1:18:52] you know if you read it's hard it's not
[1:18:54] e easy reading and you can say oh but
[1:18:56] what about the B of the dry bones and we
[1:18:58] all preaching that yeah it's true that's
[1:19:00] only one chapter oh what about go and M
[1:19:02] yeah 30 we know about that and know
[1:19:04] there's little places where even at the
[1:19:06] beginning where he talks about seeing
[1:19:08] the glory of the Lord and and as the
[1:19:10] appearance of a a man Hallelujah fire oh
[1:19:14] my but then you come to that D it's very
[1:19:17] hard reading in between after that
[1:19:19] because God is telling the people all
[1:19:20] the time all the time where they're
[1:19:23] falling short and and asking them to
[1:19:24] turn stop you can do it there's still
[1:19:27] room stop and I'll bless you but they
[1:19:29] never did stop Hallelujah and he took
[1:19:31] Ezekiel over and he saw them all there
[1:19:33] beside the temple worshiping worshiping
[1:19:36] uh what's her name asth or whatever
[1:19:38] praise the Lord breaking kicks onto her
[1:19:40] H H terrible terrible but you know so
[1:19:43] that's the whole way through that right
[1:19:45] into the the the um right up to Malachi
[1:19:49] and uh God always telling them hard to
[1:19:51] get right don't you know get right ey
[1:19:54] this is the time they never did and then
[1:19:57] I got un the New Testament and I thought
[1:20:00] wow what a difference praise God this
[1:20:03] man comes along Hallelujah we read about
[1:20:07] his birth we read about the mai we read
[1:20:09] about his uh Lage and all these things
[1:20:12] and then it just jumped into his
[1:20:14] ministry and praise God and he starts to
[1:20:17] tell them Hallelujah that they never
[1:20:19] heard in the Old Testament he said ye
[1:20:22] have heard it said but I say unto you
[1:20:25] Hallelujah blessed is the pur and spirit
[1:20:27] for theirs is the kingdom of God
[1:20:29] hallelujah and that was the difference I
[1:20:31] said what a difference what a difference
[1:20:34] hallelujah amen always telling them get
[1:20:37] back get back and the remant always did
[1:20:40] but my goodness here the Lord Jesus
[1:20:42] never a man spoke like he did Hallelujah
[1:20:45] never a man and I thank God for that
[1:20:48] amen n okay praise the Lord n Hallelujah
[1:20:51] so there that word amen even is the
[1:20:54] truth is in Jesus amen the perfect
[1:20:57] expression the representation or
[1:21:00] Revelation by language of Truth Yeah by
[1:21:04] language just like we said there it's
[1:21:06] true blessed are the poor in spirit for
[1:21:09] theirs is the kingdom of God the Kingdom
[1:21:11] of Heaven hallelujah amen and he said I
[1:21:14] have told you the truth which is in me
[1:21:16] not merely verbal but with sincerity and
[1:21:20] integrity of character he said which one
[1:21:22] of you can condemn me of sin he couldn't
[1:21:25] do it because he was sinless sinless
[1:21:27] spotless Lamb of God and that's what it
[1:21:28] means there the perfect expression the
[1:21:32] representation or Revelation by language
[1:21:35] Hallelujah of the truth amen and it's
[1:21:38] the truth hallelujah and so wonderful
[1:21:40] Amen in John 33 he said 33 he said he
[1:21:44] hasth received his testimony hath set
[1:21:48] his to his seal amen uh a witness that
[1:21:52] God is true amen God is true Hallelujah
[1:21:56] and it says amen uh that's wonderful for
[1:21:59] he whom God have sent speaketh the words
[1:22:01] of God that's wonderful and it's it's
[1:22:04] true all the way through the the
[1:22:05] Testaments it's true this this afternoon
[1:22:08] amen and I'll just leave that out I
[1:22:10] could say something there but the next
[1:22:12] the next word that I wanted to go on to
[1:22:14] that it's it's a not a known but it's
[1:22:16] spoken of you'll see here in a minute
[1:22:18] it's spoke enough of true true what is
[1:22:20] true what is factual and it's uh Ali
[1:22:23] Thea Ali Thea amen and uh Native amen is
[1:22:28] a word added to the known to give it
[1:22:30] quality to give it Clarity amen what it
[1:22:33] means what it means so amen what is
[1:22:36] manifested truth what what has been
[1:22:38] manifested hence actual true to fact
[1:22:41] hallelujah amen like crossing the Red
[1:22:44] Sea praise God and people could argue
[1:22:46] about that to the the CH come home I
[1:22:48] don't care anything I know how God did
[1:22:50] it but a strong East Wind and that was
[1:22:52] dry for them and they went AC cross ujah
[1:22:55] that's all and I know Moses spoke that
[1:22:57] word lifted up what was in his hand amen
[1:22:59] and thank God you know like the little
[1:23:01] woman Elicia said her what's in your
[1:23:03] hand she said well got all these empty
[1:23:05] jar she says some oil borrow borrow
[1:23:08] manyy borrow borrow you know and uh I
[1:23:11] think somebody was telling me sister Jun
[1:23:13] about brother um sharik there preaching
[1:23:15] about digging the ditches said no matter
[1:23:17] what anybody said keep digging if God
[1:23:19] says dig dig Hallelujah that's wonderful
[1:23:22] good it was really good amen and so uh
[1:23:25] amen that word means amen uh to give it
[1:23:28] quality it means uh true to fact like
[1:23:31] the crossing of the Red Sea is true to
[1:23:34] fact Hallelujah and and and means uh
[1:23:37] that truth is there Hallelujah so amen
[1:23:40] years ago I came up with a definition of
[1:23:42] Truth myself which really doesn't cover
[1:23:44] it all but it does cover a part of it
[1:23:46] and in the in this study today
[1:23:49] Hallelujah it says I I I I I came up
[1:23:52] with a thing uh amen that
[1:23:55] truth was that which is according to the
[1:23:57] facts now if you think about that is
[1:24:00] true praise God now if you said to me
[1:24:03] you know I came here this morning and um
[1:24:05] we had so and so for breakfast and and
[1:24:08] you know uh we got a nice Journey over
[1:24:12] and well I said is that true and you say
[1:24:15] oh that's true because it's according to
[1:24:17] the facts that's what you did and you
[1:24:19] can repeat it so if you go into the
[1:24:21] scripture it's exactly the same thought
[1:24:23] that which is according to the facts
[1:24:25] Hallelujah did he do these things or did
[1:24:27] he not did he say to the Centurion that
[1:24:30] day uh Lord if you come my servant is
[1:24:33] sick but but I'm under authority too and
[1:24:36] I've got a hund soldiers under me I say
[1:24:38] to the one come and he comes I say go go
[1:24:40] and he goes Hallelujah and he said I
[1:24:42] know that you've got Authority
[1:24:44] Hallelujah I know if you speak the word
[1:24:46] my servant will get healed Hallelujah
[1:24:49] and when he when he left amen and he met
[1:24:51] up with the other servants and he said
[1:24:53] Lord master master he they healed
[1:24:56] Hallelujah he said when did the fever
[1:24:58] break he said but such and such an are
[1:25:00] then he realized that was exactly they
[1:25:02] are he spoke to Jesus Hallelujah so why
[1:25:05] this word a AIS amen means that which is
[1:25:10] true to fact amen true to fact
[1:25:13] Hallelujah it really happened it really
[1:25:15] happened amen and you look at for
[1:25:17] instance when when brother Bram went
[1:25:19] beyond the curtain of time folks it
[1:25:21] really happened Hallelujah he could he
[1:25:23] could look at himself back lying on the
[1:25:25] bed like this Hallelujah and he's in
[1:25:28] another land he's in another dimension
[1:25:30] and it was real he said you could feel
[1:25:32] them hallelujah praise God and and I
[1:25:34] like oh I like this hallelujah amen
[1:25:38] brother Joy said it but he said do you
[1:25:40] know when when brother Bram went over
[1:25:42] there Hallelujah you notice he said they
[1:25:44] were clothed in white that's true but
[1:25:47] when you going to Revelation I'm not
[1:25:49] sure what the chapter is but it's it's a
[1:25:52] chapter where the the Jews are
[1:25:54] through the tribulation and through the
[1:25:56] Holocaust are given they're given white
[1:25:59] robes but we've got them Hallelujah we
[1:26:02] don't God doesn't need don't have to say
[1:26:04] oh I'm glad to see you there's a white
[1:26:05] Ro for you we've got them Hallelujah
[1:26:08] they are given to them but we've got
[1:26:09] them tonight we're clothed in white
[1:26:11] Hallelujah and that is that is awesome
[1:26:14] it is really awesome Amen so praise God
[1:26:17] uh amen and that's what I came up with
[1:26:19] so when Jesus walked on the water it's
[1:26:21] according to the facts he really did
[1:26:23] Hallelujah listen to this amen um
[1:26:27] amen praise the lord it's only when
[1:26:29] Peter walked on the water and took his
[1:26:31] eyes of Jesus he began to sink amen and
[1:26:34] Jesus lifted him up and he didn't say
[1:26:35] Well done Peter at least you got 10 fet
[1:26:37] he said why did you doubt why did you
[1:26:40] doubt praise God my when he gets a man
[1:26:42] or a woman that's not going to doubt the
[1:26:44] promise praise God hallelujah you you'll
[1:26:48] get something out of that there amen so
[1:26:50] then they were in the ship and they came
[1:26:52] they worshiped him saying offer truth
[1:26:55] thou artart the Son of God when brother
[1:26:58] brandham I told you about per green so
[1:27:00] I'll leave that there but of a truth
[1:27:02] Thou Art the Son of God they worshiped
[1:27:04] him Hallelujah and I'm getting on
[1:27:05] rightly so so praise God I hope not to
[1:27:07] hold you uh too much time amen so what
[1:27:10] is true in any matter under
[1:27:11] consideration Amen in John 1 it says and
[1:27:15] the Word was made flesh and dwelt among
[1:27:16] us and we beheld his glory the glory of
[1:27:19] the only begotten of the father full of
[1:27:22] grace and full of Truth hallelujah amen
[1:27:26] amen and and and he was Hallelujah
[1:27:28] everything he said everything he
[1:27:30] explained even on the cross Hallelujah
[1:27:33] he's still speaking the truth amen and
[1:27:35] they're scratching their head I wonder
[1:27:37] was that really a lger who was it they
[1:27:39] didn't know amen they didn't know but
[1:27:41] praise God he was full of grace
[1:27:44] Hallelujah and he was full of Truth amen
[1:27:46] and uh and the law was given by Moses
[1:27:49] but Grace and Truth came by Jesus Christ
[1:27:53] because there was a Heavenly Tabernacle
[1:27:56] and and God said to Moses now he
[1:27:58] couldn't have had all that in his mind
[1:27:59] there no way for every curtain every
[1:28:02] ring uh everything that was going to be
[1:28:04] in the Tabernacle that God just told
[1:28:06] Moses and he said all I remember all
[1:28:08] that he actually saw it up there
[1:28:11] somewhere the way it is with God
[1:28:13] hallelujah I'd love to see it too amen
[1:28:16] praise God the heavenly is much greater
[1:28:18] than the Earthly it's gone but the one
[1:28:21] in heaven is still there praise God and
[1:28:24] and we thank the Lord as we read it out
[1:28:26] from Hebrews this morning amen so praise
[1:28:29] God Amen that aaliah amen that which is
[1:28:33] true in any matter that you consider
[1:28:35] praise God and that is so true of our
[1:28:37] Lord Jesus amen and so then in Matthew
[1:28:40] 22 it says the the the herodians came to
[1:28:43] him amen always trying to trick him
[1:28:46] always trying to trick him they always
[1:28:47] thought that are more smarter than he
[1:28:49] was and so one time they said Lord what
[1:28:52] what should we give to Caesar they're
[1:28:54] really trying to trap him you know and
[1:28:56] if he says oh don't give Caesar anything
[1:28:58] said oh you're an enemy of Caesar just
[1:29:00] broadcast that if they say no don't give
[1:29:02] him nothing they say oh no he's he's an
[1:29:05] enemy of Caesar and if he says give them
[1:29:07] something they say oh he's supporting
[1:29:09] the Romans and they got him they had him
[1:29:11] they thought they had him until he said
[1:29:13] show me a
[1:29:14] penny just so simple God in Simplicity
[1:29:17] and there he showed him a penny H said
[1:29:20] who's that said that's Caesar amen I
[1:29:22] think it's Nero actually on about I
[1:29:24] might be wrong there but Augustus or
[1:29:25] whatever but anyway he said then you
[1:29:27] give to Caesar what Caesars and as far
[1:29:30] as we're concerned Caesar ain't got
[1:29:32] nothing that we want Hallelujah and he
[1:29:34] said then give to God what's his gods
[1:29:36] and they went away what did he say what
[1:29:39] was never heard anything like it amen
[1:29:42] praise God and so they said to him in
[1:29:45] this particular story they said Master
[1:29:47] oh Master teacher we know that thou are
[1:29:50] true oh yeah lovely yeah yeah yeah and
[1:29:53] you know just soft suing him you know
[1:29:55] and uh praise God and it says and you
[1:29:58] teach us the way of God and Truth he
[1:30:00] could have stopped him right there and
[1:30:01] said then why do you not believe me but
[1:30:03] he didn't so then they go on and uh amen
[1:30:06] so praise God uh that's what they were
[1:30:09] coming to amen that what is true in any
[1:30:12] matter under consideration and you care
[1:30:14] for uh no man for thy regardest not the
[1:30:17] person of man should we do this should
[1:30:19] we do that they were just trying to
[1:30:21] trick him amen praise God but they
[1:30:23] didn't realize
[1:30:24] that he was the truth praise God and
[1:30:27] embodied in human form amen and uh you
[1:30:30] know it says in Romans it says what if
[1:30:32] some did not believe shall their
[1:30:34] unbelief make the faith of God without
[1:30:35] effect God forbid let God be true and
[1:30:38] let every man a liar as it is written
[1:30:41] that thou may be justified in thy saying
[1:30:44] and mayest overcome when thou are judged
[1:30:47] amen so Hallelujah for that and I will
[1:30:49] get into a few quotes before I I close
[1:30:51] but there's so much of this that's in
[1:30:53] the scripture that I had to keep it in
[1:30:55] the scripture for a lot to to make this
[1:30:57] out amen and U he talks about in Peter
[1:31:00] about Sylvanas a faithful brother unto
[1:31:03] you as I suppose I have written briefly
[1:31:05] exhorting and testifying that that this
[1:31:09] is the true grace of God wherein you
[1:31:13] stand Hallelujah folks you know as the
[1:31:15] man said you got to know that you know
[1:31:18] that you know that's all about it
[1:31:20] Hallelujah you're not there no doubt

[1:31:34] and uh praise God he said the true grace
[1:31:37] of God in which you stand or that the
[1:31:41] grace of God the unate favor of God is
[1:31:44] true to fact amen so if you experience
[1:31:46] it that's the best way you know the
[1:31:48] scripture says taste and see that the
[1:31:51] Lord is good see there there you have it
[1:31:53] is that the truth is that according to
[1:31:56] the matter under consideration if I
[1:31:58] taste will it be good and he said yes
[1:32:02] you taste and see so when you taste and
[1:32:04] see and you a lot of you have done that
[1:32:06] amen that the Lord is good the Lord is
[1:32:09] good thank God for that I thank God Amen
[1:32:11] all of my life you've been faithful amen
[1:32:14] and then in John a new commandment I
[1:32:16] read unto you which thing is true in him
[1:32:19] and you because the darkness has passed
[1:32:22] the light shineth now shineth not only a
[1:32:25] light but the True Light that was to
[1:32:27] come into the world Amen and the
[1:32:29] Commandment is true Christ is true to
[1:32:32] fact Vindicated to be the truth and the
[1:32:35] light amen and Jesus said himself I am
[1:32:39] the light of the world that's the great
[1:32:41] lighthous Hallelujah that's shining amen
[1:32:44] the light of the world may I say it like
[1:32:47] this he said I am the light of the world
[1:32:49] may I say it like this I am that is the
[1:32:52] person of God Amen the person Son of God
[1:32:54] hallelujah I
[1:32:56] am the illumination of the world that
[1:32:59] means to see the truth brother Bram said
[1:33:03] the word of God is the light in this
[1:33:05] hour the revealed word is the light of
[1:33:08] the hour Hallelujah so praise God when
[1:33:10] you can see it you don't understand why
[1:33:12] you can see it but you can see it and
[1:33:14] you know it's the truth you've got that
[1:33:16] witness in your heart hallelujah oh my

[1:35:11] word hallelujah so praise God uh that
[1:35:14] which is true to fact actual amen and uh
[1:35:17] the thing is true amen he's the light of
[1:35:18] the world Hallelujah let me go right on
[1:35:20] and I'll I'll finish up just as quickly
[1:35:22] as I can yeah have not too much more to
[1:35:24] do praise God Amen and um Amen Let me
[1:35:28] see here yes uh in in one John five I've
[1:35:32] left out a few there but don't matter
[1:35:33] and we know that the Son of God has come
[1:35:35] and has given us an understanding that
[1:35:38] we may know him that is true and we are
[1:35:41] in him that is true even in his son
[1:35:44] Jesus Christ this is the true God this
[1:35:48] is eternal life Hallelujah so that's why
[1:35:51] we're not we're not pondering about
[1:35:53] brother Samuel or a Wonder we know we
[1:35:57] know Hallelujah where he is this morning
[1:35:59] or this afternoon praise God it's
[1:36:01] wonderful and we know also he wouldn't
[1:36:02] come back here say said brother George
[1:36:05] no I'm sorry I'm not coming today yeah
[1:36:07] right we're having a meeting up here you
[1:36:08] know it's very good hallelujah amen and
[1:36:11] we understand that I wouldn't call my
[1:36:12] wife back at her not for a million
[1:36:14] pounds no a million dollars wouldn't do
[1:36:16] it praise the Lord so praise God because
[1:36:18] I know where she is is a far better
[1:36:20] place than this amen and and and we know
[1:36:23] him is true that's lovely Hallelujah in
[1:36:26] Thessalonians amen there's another
[1:36:28] little word here it's a little change
[1:36:30] Ali Theos Ali not the alios and it has a
[1:36:35] little another aspect of of Truth so he
[1:36:38] says in one Thessalonians it says for
[1:36:40] they show us what manner of entering we
[1:36:43] have had unto us probably the the
[1:36:45] prophets and now ye turn to God from
[1:36:48] Idols to serve the living and the true
[1:36:52] God Amen and and to wait for his son
[1:36:55] from Heaven whom he raised from the dead
[1:36:57] even Jesus which delivered us from the
[1:37:00] Roth to come Hallelujah so praise God
[1:37:02] when it comes to Easter time when it
[1:37:04] comes to Sunday what do we do you know
[1:37:06] brother brandham didn't say it he said
[1:37:07] we come on a Sunday morning to honor the
[1:37:10] resurrection that we believe you walk in
[1:37:12] that door you're saying I believe that
[1:37:14] he's raised today I believe in his
[1:37:17] presence with us today I believe he's
[1:37:19] walking with me every day I believe
[1:37:21] we're on the King's Highway walking in
[1:37:22] the way Hallelujah and I believe one day
[1:37:25] we're all going to get to gather around
[1:37:26] a great big table Hallelujah thousand
[1:37:29] miles long and I'll tell you what a day
[1:37:31] that will be when every tear will be
[1:37:33] washed away hallelujah oh no more pain
[1:37:36] no more sickness amen hallelujah so this
[1:37:38] denotes truth in the sense of being real
[1:37:42] and genuine amen and it's used of God in
[1:37:45] Revelation 6 amen where it says and they
[1:37:49] cried with a loud voice saying hard long
[1:37:51] oh Lord holy and true Dost th not judge
[1:37:56] and avenge our blood on them that dwell
[1:37:58] on the earth amen and so what I said it
[1:38:01] meant there this denotes truth in it
[1:38:04] being genuine it's real Hallelujah and
[1:38:08] they're asking how long and he told
[1:38:10] that's where he gives them the the REM
[1:38:12] amen and praise God that which is not
[1:38:15] only by name and resemblance but the
[1:38:17] real nature corresponding to his name
[1:38:20] how long oh Lord truth oh always comes
[1:38:24] back to the name always Hallelujah truth
[1:38:27] Amen brother praise God and that's what
[1:38:30] they're saying oh Lord how long amen
[1:38:33] true and holy amen how long and and the
[1:38:36] the real nature corresponding to the
[1:38:38] name amen that this word and and every
[1:38:41] aspect uh corresponding to the idea
[1:38:45] signified by the name that the name real
[1:38:48] genuine but there's something else like
[1:38:51] Jehovah jera praise God now Jehovah is
[1:38:53] his name but then there's tagged on it
[1:38:55] Jara Hallelujah so what is it his name
[1:38:59] his nature his name is Jehovah his
[1:39:02] nature is that he provides so we're
[1:39:05] coming to a god that provides our needs
[1:39:07] hallelujah we're coming to a god that
[1:39:10] you know you might some of you might be
[1:39:11] saying it's all right for you to say
[1:39:13] that there but I'm going through a real
[1:39:14] rough time I wanted a little pity party
[1:39:16] here today you know but you not get one
[1:39:18] for me n of my people I don't believe in
[1:39:20] pett parties amen praise God if God
[1:39:23] taking you to a hard time he'll get you
[1:39:24] to a hard time Hallelujah just keep on
[1:39:27] trusting amen and so his nature is that
[1:39:29] he supplies our needs you know when you
[1:39:32] get really into a a real problem amen
[1:39:35] and uh the Bible says he's a very
[1:39:38] present help in time of trouble that'll
[1:39:41] go with this morning a very present help
[1:39:43] in the time of trouble so what have I to
[1:39:45] fear what have I amen I'm leaning on the
[1:39:48] Everlasting Arms with my Lord so near
[1:39:51] I'm leaning on the Everlasting Arms so
[1:39:53] what happens whatever happens it'll work
[1:39:56] for our good amen the whole purpose of
[1:39:59] it and that's the same with it I didn't
[1:40:00] even mention the C meetings but that's
[1:40:02] all work good for good to them that love
[1:40:04] the Lord amen because it declares what
[1:40:07] God fulfills by the meaning of his name
[1:40:10] amen he's truly God Amen he's truly mine
[1:40:14] Hallelujah and he's the opposite to
[1:40:16] fictitious to counterfeit to imaginary
[1:40:20] to simulate it or pretend it he is God
[1:40:23] the true God and distinction from all
[1:40:26] over everything that's false he's the
[1:40:29] true one that's it he says it in the
[1:40:30] book of Isaiah he said I am the Lord
[1:40:33] beside me there is no other other there
[1:40:35] false gods and all that but beside me
[1:40:37] there is no other I'm the one amen above
[1:40:40] all L on the highest the highest
[1:40:43] spiritual being the highest order of
[1:40:45] spiritual being it's in God it's in
[1:40:47] Jesus Christ today Hallelujah so amen
[1:40:50] and it says these things says the amen
[1:40:52] the faithful and the true witness amen a
[1:40:56] faithful and you know you don't want
[1:40:57] someone to come along and tell you lie
[1:40:59] they don't want you to do that you know
[1:41:01] somebody come up and say oh I know that
[1:41:03] you could buy something for you know
[1:41:05] maybe $2,000 and you're going to save
[1:41:07] 3,000 or something thinking you don't
[1:41:09] want somebody coming along telling you
[1:41:10] that amen oh I believe it oh that would
[1:41:12] be wonderful you know you don't want it
[1:41:14] has to be praise God a a faithful
[1:41:17] witness someone that ain't going to tell
[1:41:19] you a lie amen and I'll tell you the
[1:41:21] very few of them about but I'll tell you
[1:41:22] what you can you can prove it amen and
[1:41:25] uh praise the Lord that that that's it
[1:41:26] amen that we may know him that is true
[1:41:30] and we are in him that is true even his
[1:41:33] son Jesus Christ this is the true God
[1:41:36] this is eternal life Hallelujah
[1:41:38] wonderful and could have throw this out

[1:41:42] it okay and then I'll bring it back to

[1:48:04] God to go to but we've come to the real
[1:48:06] one the one that that made it all happen

[1:48:14] it happened amen and thank God for that
[1:48:16] hallelujah amen okay he said this is
[1:48:20] eternal life that you may know the only
[1:48:22] true God God and Jesus Christ whom he
[1:48:25] has sent amen okay let me just come
[1:48:27] right down to if I may praise God yeah
[1:48:33] yeah I I want to finish up just going to
[1:48:34] leave some of us but you've got enough
[1:48:36] you've got enough to to get my thought
[1:48:38] today now remember the fraudster he had
[1:48:41] no basis for truth upon which to operate
[1:48:44] you have every basis there is to operate
[1:48:47] cuz you know everything he said is the
[1:48:48] truth everything he said is the truth
[1:48:51] it's going to happen if he said it's
[1:48:52] going to happen it's going to happen if
[1:48:54] he says I'm going to bless you he will
[1:48:55] bless you praise something that there
[1:48:58] Hallelujah it will come to pass amen and
[1:49:00] uh so Amen brother Bram says this and I
[1:49:04] want you to notice this he says uh if
[1:49:06] this is my last meeting with you people
[1:49:09] he said the vision the visitation of the
[1:49:12] Angel is true amen hallelujah praise God
[1:49:17] and and and I remember it was Ronald
[1:49:19] that said it that caught my attention
[1:49:21] where where where where he said you know
[1:49:23] do you really believe that the the devil
[1:49:27] knows what happened in that cave do you
[1:49:29] really believe that the devil knows an
[1:49:31] angel appeared to brother brandham he
[1:49:33] said certainly it happened and you can
[1:49:35] tell where because when the prophet love
[1:49:38] young children and this little girl came
[1:49:40] up for prayer and her eyes were so
[1:49:42] crossed amen and and he thought about
[1:49:44] his own little girl amen that was dying
[1:49:47] in pain 10 months old oh my what a time
[1:49:50] that was and brother Branham could never
[1:49:52] explain that
[1:49:53] right that's one thing that he couldn't
[1:49:55] get from God why why that little girl
[1:49:58] why that little girl why did you take
[1:49:59] her Lord and he never got an explanation
[1:50:01] cuz God doesn't ow as an explanation and
[1:50:03] the best thing and I can tell you people
[1:50:05] this the best thing as I operate my life
[1:50:08] if you don't ask the question you don't
[1:50:10] need an answer it's only when you got a
[1:50:12] question do you need an answer but if
[1:50:14] you don't if you've got trust you say
[1:50:15] Lord I trust you I I I I just trust you
[1:50:18] amen that you're in this thing and was
[1:50:20] going to work out to your glory that's
[1:50:23] and so when brother Bram was praying and
[1:50:25] this nothing happened couple of times he
[1:50:27] prayed for her then he began to realize
[1:50:29] there's something going on here and so
[1:50:31] he took that little child up in his arms
[1:50:34] and he didn't he he had finished praying
[1:50:36] he just turned directly to the devil and
[1:50:38] he say you know an angel of God appeared
[1:50:41] to me in that cave and he said leave the
[1:50:45] little girl and bang her eyes
[1:50:48] just so that proves it that surely
[1:50:50] proves it amen that that that praise God
[1:50:53] he says the vision the visitation of the
[1:50:55] Angel it's true and I wouldn't even have
[1:50:58] time to listen to anybody to say oh I
[1:50:59] don't believe that okay if you don't
[1:51:02] believe it it's not for you just as
[1:51:03] simple as that hallelujah praise God I'm
[1:51:06] and among Believers today hallelujah
[1:51:08] we're among Believers we're Believers
[1:51:10] today not unbelievers not even M
[1:51:12] Believers we are believing what we've
[1:51:14] been told Hallelujah and it is true amen
[1:51:18] so he said if I die this moment it's the
[1:51:21] truth hallelujah and what about the true
[1:51:23] seed it will happen just as we have said
[1:51:26] the people of God uh are being made
[1:51:30] ready by the word of truth from the
[1:51:33] messenger of the age amen and Revelation
[1:51:37] 10:7 and he will be the fullness of
[1:51:40] Pentecost for the spirit will bring the
[1:51:42] people right back to where they were at
[1:51:45] the beginning Hallelujah that is thus
[1:51:49] saith the Lord hallelujah I love that
[1:51:52] thus said the Lord the only one that
[1:51:54] never said thus said the Lord was Jesus
[1:51:56] cuz he didn't need to say it he was the
[1:51:58] Lord hallelujah amen and what a blessing
[1:52:01] folks for us to see the godhead as we
[1:52:03] see it what a blessing Hallelujah you
[1:52:06] know and and and and the Simplicity of
[1:52:08] it is is that you cannot take Christ
[1:52:11] away from Jesus you just can't split
[1:52:14] them they will not split Hallelujah and
[1:52:16] you cannot take Christ away from God
[1:52:19] they will not split and there you got
[1:52:21] the whole godhead right there the
[1:52:23] fullness of the god H dwelling in him

[1:53:15] times it became flesh Hallelujah that's
[1:53:17] the Adon Adon amen and the lovely thing
[1:53:20] is that you could use that word of
[1:53:22] Abraham as he said my master Abraham or
[1:53:25] Adon my master see and and and it would
[1:53:27] be that way but you can use it of God
