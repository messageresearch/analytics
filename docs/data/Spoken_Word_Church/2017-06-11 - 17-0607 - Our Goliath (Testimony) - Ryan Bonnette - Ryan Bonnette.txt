========================================

good evening everybody so two Wednesday nights ago brother Terrence mentioned a request a praise report that we had about a tree that fell on our property and I wanted to give you the testimony than the pictures about that can you pull up the first slide please so because what happened was actually very supernatural so it's over the last 10 years gee that's can y'all see that you dim a couple of lights maybe four please so ten years ago Gabby now got married and moved into this little house that we live in and we've been keeping around on that big hickory tree because it's enormous and because of that little hollow place there at the bottom of the tree but it wasn't any real reason to be concerned right off just because it was a still very live tree very strong now I can't see brother Wade next slide please in March of this year though there came a big wind in the storm and the like a tornado force wind just for about five seconds it sound like a locomotive in our backyard and and we started seeking shelter and then all at once it stopped went out the next day and looked and there was now a big crack in addition to her hollow place down the side of the tree about the first 12 feet of that trunk so we started calling around and thinking you know now it's time to have the tree removed so we called several tree companies go back one side please and what we're just going to do is have them cut the limbs off the top of the tree that would remove the threat so it couldn't reach her house maybe 500 bucks is what I was thinking when they said two to four thousand dollars because they're gonna have to bring in heavy equipment so I said no thank you so they're looking into ways of doing it myself which is somewhat irrational because it'd be very dangerous but anyway in the meantime go to the next slide please just so you know what these are also temporarily is a measure to keep try to keep it from falling on house secured it to two other adjacent trees with log change but that really wouldn't keep it off our house permanently that was just in the meantime till I could get I'm done I next slide so here's the setup we've got next slide next slide there's so our house here this is on the back edge of our property can everybody see that okay so our house here oh that's better neighbor's house here other neighbor's house here our utility building us here barn down there so the tree is surrounded by about five structures so any way it would fall in that direction it would desecrate whatever it would land on because a very lively very heavy full of moisture tree so it would be very damaging I'll stand there all I was doing wasn't thing about the scripture I was standing about in this spot where this picture was taken from looking up at it studying and thinking now what can I do to take this down without hurting myself and all of a sudden the scripture came to my mind where Jesus said Luke 17 6 if you have faith as a grain of mustard seed you shall say to this I think it said sick of entry be thou plucked up by the root and be thou planted in the sea and it should obey you so I looked up at the tree and I thought now I can't fall anywhere over this way without doing damage but back on this side is a dilapidated chain-link fence it belongs to an adjacent commercial property already falling in they don't care about the fence evidently so I said to that tree I just slipped up in a quiet voice I said when you fall fall this way I didn't shout I wasn't anointed I wasn't like anything great God hides in such simplicity that sometimes it can be working through you and you not even know it okay God is really incredible in hiding in simplicity and so much to where you won't even realize when he's working through you well that was back in March or so and I went on and forgot about it now I should also mention that on this side of the tree facing our house most of the limbs are on that side and I'm not talking about little in some of these limbs are the size of a small tree themselves and some of them shoot 20 or 30 feet out over a yard so all the weights on that side of the tree if you stand here and look up it's got about a four or five degree lean toward our house and then the hollow place in the cracked place on that side of trees so everything every rational thought would tell you that that tree is going to fall on that house okay but I didn't stand there and rationalize about it those things didn't come into my mind I just simply looked up and said when you fall go this way you know there's a thing in the military I've never been in the military but heard this quote that I like a soldier's duty is not to reason why a soldier's duty is to do or die the desperate or perish but just simply obey what you've been told to do no matter how irrational it seems and the scripture plainly said Jesus didn't say wood the tree lean that way or make it fall the way it's you know wanting to fall in anyway he just said speak to this tree that's it we had a legitimate need we just needed it not fall in our house which wasn't me temps in God I wasn't testing to see what I could do so next slide please at the same time this was going on I didn't realize this but Gabby was inside the house during the same about the same time telling our kids they said mommy is it going to fall in our house they said and she said to them no this tree is going to be like Goliath you know in the story of David and Goliath he was struck in the front but he fell forward he should have fallen backward but I believe God had him fall forward because he was defying God the boss says every knee shall bow you know if you defy God he'll bring you to your knees and bring you down and the fact is Goliath I'll forward when he should have fell backwards so Gaby was telling the girls no baby that tree is going to fall backwards the weight was on the front of the tree search the salt should fall forward she said no it's going to fall backwards so she was making that confession and I was speaking to the tree and we didn't know that either one of us was doing that no but the veil told us to read the message of grace about a week ago I was reading through that about my third time reading that and I've never caught this before sure y'all knew this but this is the second time that brother Branham spoke squirrels into existence I always thought it's just that one time but he says I thought right here for God gave me them squirrels last year to speak into existence took off my hat again and said Lord God you're still the same Jesus you're still God somebody said to me how many do you need this time I said this to the other times limit and then I said I shall have this trend up before 10 o'clock today and strangely the same system there was a very bad mosquito area grows infested with mosquitoes and the kind of a swampland and the great big mosquito came to bite me right by my eye and I said not one of them will bother me this day so speaking the nature and then he went on to say fall into it and he said the Sun will shine within 30 minutes the brother phantoms speaking to nature three times he's commanded nature and if you read on all three of those things came to pass the squirrels came to resistance the mosquitoes went away and the Sun came out so what's happening here Jesus said the meek shall inherit the earth right this is there's a position we're coming to and I believe this is leading up to that now the next slide please this shows you that tree towering over our house it dwarfs the other trees in our backyard it's this middle one right here that's our Goliath okay and this is our little teeny-weeny house and just before I forget to say if the tree were to fall this way we later measure the tree and found out where it would land the top of the tree would be on my Nissan Frontier in our front yard it would have engulfed our house there was another storm that came to Tuesday nights ago 10:30 at night that tree fell now there's only one tree in our neighborhood that we know of that fell there was a lot of wind in a lot of areas I think a lot of damage in North Georgia Noah Green Street had a tough time there was a lot of trees fell on Green Street but in our neighborhood there's only one tree that we know that fell very odd the way this happened but that night the girls are already in beds they weren't stomping and running around making noise so there's no reason we should have not heard that tree fall see anybody ever heard of tree fall it's very violent and very awesome it takes down the tops of other trees with it it brings down whole other trees with it and breaks off the limbs of other trees it grabs everything grab on the way down the the trunk will pop and crack and twist and torque and then finally when it hits the ground it makes a loud thud and you can feel it in your insides shaking if you're within a hundred feet of it well none of that okay the girlfriend bed is sleep I was on this end of the house gaving I was off work that week so I was at home Gavin I were doing our quiet time on opposite ends of the house I was reading so I was well able to hear the storm and she was on this end in the back bedroom the most vulnerable position to be in if that tree should fall in the house and she was listening to brother Bob I think in one year she always keeps one ear open she has an earbud in one ear and she keeps other ear open to hear kids because together so we were both able to hear the storm there wasn't a lot of wind at our house it was done but not a lot and then you know just heavy rain and thunder and lightning all of a sudden we heard a pinging sound on the back of our house sounded like little pieces of bark or debris get in the back of our house where that thing snapped and then we heard Gabi said she heard a few limbs breaking so we ran to the back window and looked thinking that maybe some limbs fell off the tree pitch-black dark about that time to light and lit up the sky and we saw this huge void go to the next slide we saw this great big void where that tree used to stand and it fell exactly where we told it to fall down to the inch exactly the opposite way from our house and I'm telling you I don't know how much wind it would take to make it do that but to overcome the leverage of all those limbs and to write the tree in the first place because it was leaning and bend it backward like that make it fall back had to have taken a lot of land but there wasn't so next slide go back one go back to this previous slide I'm sorry we measured that next one in the length of the tree to be 95 feet we measured it twice we just walked down the length of the trunk on into that neighbor property nothing over there by the way there's a commercial storage building place down here but nothing else for it to hurt it didn't hurt anything except that fence back there 95 feet and we measured from the stump back this way to our house 60 68 feet so it would have completely consumed our home then now the next slide the closest thing came to is that little cheap metal building of ours real thin metal it came within inches of that just a big piece of the of the Barton splintered off of there Thanks slide I'm not a good photographer this the best I could do about getting a side view but basically this is only like the first 10 feet of the tree so with your imagination flip that over this way and then add another 85 feet going out that way toward our little house next slide this is just before and after shot of the light that's before he fell standing nice and strong and then after he fell and there's a little Pentecostal kid dancing in our front yard either because it was the last day of school or because the tree fell next time just a closer up view of the same thing and then the last one is a picture of my mom she came to claim the firewood for the next several winters she's got a fireplace so we're going to try to cut it up and haul it to her house but uh the most amazing thing about this is if you look back to the last sermon that was preached here before that happened it was on May 21st this the tree fell on May 23rd May 21st for the Wade the second sermon that day he preached the fall and he preached about the title deed and he was talking a lot about these things about us come back to the position that Adam was in before the fall have dominion with fishes exceeding the fowl of the air and so forth not a coincidence Jesus said the meek shall inherit the earth and you know what's amazing too about this is I'm not standing here to toot mine & Gabby's horn and say we did anything I'm saying all of y'all have done this before y'all but y'all spoken to storms at weather spiritual or natural and move things in your own life you know just don't overlook those things has got hiding simplicity if you really think you'll realize that God was there working through you and just remember the things because what God wants to forget when he does something is for purpose you know thank y'all so much for the time the Lord is he still God amen I appreciate that testimony but I I think we all do that all things are possible to them that believe you know better on I just appreciate their tests
