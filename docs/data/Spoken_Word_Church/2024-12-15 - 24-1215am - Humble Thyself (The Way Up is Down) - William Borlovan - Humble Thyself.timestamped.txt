[15:26] sister Janine you come up for your
[15:27] testimony
[15:29] [Music]
[15:35] good morning
[15:37] felle bear with me I hate public
[15:40] speaking
[15:42] um we are really blessed in this church
[15:44] to have the teaching and the leadership
[15:47] that we have and we're all aware of that
[15:50] and we're all grateful for that but I
[15:52] became aware of something really small
[15:54] to be grateful for for this
[15:57] church um our Christmas gift we get one
[16:01] every year it's just routine for us
[16:04] we're grateful for it and we're blessed
[16:05] to have it but we kind of expect to get
[16:08] something from the church I just thought
[16:10] that was normal for all
[16:12] churches but this the Monday after we
[16:16] got that from the church I was talking
[16:17] to a couple of ladies that go to church
[16:20] that I work with their churches give
[16:23] them nothing like
[16:25] Christmas and so they're always
[16:28] surprised
[16:29] when I say you know oh my church blessed
[16:32] me with this at Christmas this was our
[16:34] gift this year and they're like really
[16:37] and I was like yes and you know I really
[16:40] didn't think anybody I was grateful for
[16:42] it but I really didn't think anything
[16:43] about it Beyond saying thank you Jesus
[16:47] and but they're like they don't get
[16:48] anything from their churches they don't
[16:50] get a thank you they don't get a card
[16:52] they don't get fruit they get nothing
[16:54] from their churches from CHR for
[16:56] Christmas and it's like they get all of
[16:59] their TI give their ties to the church
[17:01] but the church really doesn't return
[17:03] anything to them extra they you know so
[17:07] I was like really blessed I just want to
[17:10] say that I'm grateful for that that that
[17:11] was really a big blessing that we have
[17:13] in this church that I'm really grateful
[17:15] for the second thing that I want to be
[17:17] blessed tell y'all been blessed with is
[17:21] the job that I was provided with when I
[17:23] moved to Georgia a little over three
[17:24] years ago it's really good company um
[17:28] they
[17:29] give us a merit raise it is in their
[17:32] things written up saying when you sign
[17:35] on from the company that they're
[17:36] guaranteeing you a merit raise every
[17:38] year and a bonus every year they don't
[17:42] tell you how much but they basically say
[17:44] that you will get a cost of living raise
[17:46] every year that's just the way it is
[17:49] which I'm really grateful for because a
[17:50] lot of companies don't do that but this
[17:52] year I not only got my Merit
[17:55] raise which was good I got a huge bonus
[18:00] above what the company usually gives
[18:03] which I'm really thankful for I was able
[18:05] to send that to Nicole and pay off the
[18:08] Disney trip that she asked me to help
[18:10] her take the kids on in
[18:13] February um and then on top of that I
[18:16] got a new job title and with that new
[18:18] job title I got another 4% raise on top
[18:23] of my
[18:24] Merit
[18:26] so I just really wanted to say that God
[18:28] not only bless me with a company good
[18:31] company to work for that has continued
[18:33] to appreciate me but every year God puts
[18:36] it in their heart to give me a little
[18:38] something extra that shows me that they
[18:41] appreciate me so I just wanted to say
[18:43] God thank you for that
[18:47] am brother Ryan you want to come on up
[18:50] FR
[18:57] amen for
[19:56] God bless you all uh sister June

[32:49] feeling all right and all of a sudden
[32:51] you get a certain pain and you go to the
[32:52] doctor and all of a sudden you've got
[32:53] four months to live what that what that
[32:55] does to you and how that tests you you
[32:57] know and God's been good with he's going
[32:59] I believe on like five years and God's
[33:01] been faithful God uses doctors
[33:04] amen there're certainly thankful for
[33:06] that brother Boyd is an example so good
[33:08] to see you our dear brother and how God
[33:10] uses doctors to catch things and and
[33:13] uses hands of doctors to pull us through
[33:15] things amen God anoints real doctors to
[33:18] take care of us so God bless you we're
[33:21] not going to keep you standing but if
[33:22] you just turn the scriptures to me with
[33:24] me rather we'll go to go to the word
[33:26] Matthew 18 ver verse
[33:28] one the second one will be in Matthew 23
[33:31] so we'll be in the Book of Matthew but
[33:32] we'll begin with Matthew the 18th
[33:34] chapter beginning there at the first
[33:36] verse don't you love the Lord amen he's
[33:39] so good to us that you know Satan would
[33:42] tell you he's not good to you but we
[33:44] know better he's good to us if you're
[33:46] here right now breathe in Air he's good
[33:48] to you amen the scripture reading at the
[33:52] same time came the disciples unto Jesus
[33:55] saying who is the greatest in the
[33:58] kingdom of heaven and Jesus called a
[34:02] little child unto him and he set him in
[34:06] the midst of them now notice Jesus
[34:08] didn't say bring me
[34:10] caiaphus bring me a
[34:12] Pharisee he didn't say bring come here
[34:15] Peter he said bring me a
[34:19] child and he said verily I say unto you
[34:24] except ye be converted and become as
[34:27] little children ye shall not enter into
[34:30] the Kingdom of
[34:32] Heaven whosoever therefore shall humble
[34:36] himself as this little child the same is
[34:40] the greatest in the Kingdom of Heaven
[34:43] think about that you got God in flesh he
[34:45] he brings a child and he said he you
[34:48] talk about a
[34:50] sermon all the the the great officers in
[34:53] the religion of the land and Jesus says
[34:55] except you become brother Bob as this
[34:57] little
[34:58] child you will in no wise enter the
[35:01] Kingdom of Heaven in Matthew 23:
[35:07] 11 but he that is greatest among you
[35:12] shall be your
[35:14] servant and whosoever shall exalt
[35:18] himself shall be a
[35:20] based and he that shall humble
[35:24] himself shall be exalted so we're fa
[35:27] with two
[35:29] choices if we exalt ourselves even in
[35:32] our own thinking God's going to make
[35:34] sure that we're
[35:36] humbled but if we within our own selves
[35:39] humble ourselves and we realize that we
[35:41] are
[35:42] nothing then God's going to come behind
[35:45] and exalt you amen amen let's bow our
[35:49] heads dear gracious Heavenly Father Lord
[35:52] how we love you with all of our hearts
[35:54] we thank you Lord for these moments in
[35:56] your presence we thank thank you for our
[35:58] brothers and sisters oh God that have
[35:59] gathered together Lord under Lord the
[36:02] authority of your word we just ask that
[36:03] you just forgive us of our sins speak to
[36:05] our hearts our hearts are open and if
[36:08] they're not may you open them Lord that
[36:10] the spoken word which is the Original
[36:12] Seed may come into our hearts and bring
[36:14] forth the fruit of the word we ask you
[36:16] be with each need Lord you heard every
[36:18] request and every concern and you know
[36:20] every burden that's on the heart father
[36:22] I pray that you grant meet each and
[36:24] every need Lord you heard oh God the cry
[36:27] about the prodical and father we just
[36:28] send your spirit and Lord many times we
[36:31] pray we may not see that you're working
[36:33] but just because we don't see it doesn't
[36:35] mean you're not we love you and we thank
[36:37] you in Jesus Christ's name amen amen God
[36:40] bless you you may take your seats in the
[36:43] name of the Lord Jesus Christ with the
[36:46] help of the Lord this morning I'd like
[36:47] to title this sermon humble
[36:51] yourself the Way Up Is
[36:54] Down you know the word of God is so
[36:57] often so contradictory to the human way
[37:00] of
[37:01] thinking because we think it's you know
[37:03] how can something how can I how can I
[37:05] put myself down and actually end up
[37:07] being up but that is the way that God
[37:10] has
[37:11] set in the in the sermon love brother R
[37:13] said we know so much God dwells in the
[37:17] center of humility and simplicity don't
[37:21] never forget that and you know in this
[37:25] end time God has blessed us and and send
[37:26] us a message M and there's so much truth
[37:29] and there's so much reality and there's
[37:30] so much Revelation there's so much power
[37:33] in this message it's important that in
[37:35] order that we harness and really benefit
[37:38] from all the power and the Revelation
[37:40] and the understanding and and the
[37:42] authority of the message it's important
[37:44] brother Ryan that we don't forget the
[37:47] basics because without the basics and
[37:50] you say well well preacher what do you
[37:51] mean by the basics the basics of
[37:54] love and how powerful love is
[37:58] and the the basics of humility and how
[38:00] no matter what God ever does for you
[38:03] whether he does for you in the natural
[38:05] realm or in the spiritual realm it is
[38:07] important that we always remain humble
[38:09] about it now to be humble is not to deny
[38:13] what God has done for you but in in in a
[38:15] way of how you perceive yourself of how
[38:18] we perceive ourselves we're always to
[38:20] make sure and we're always to double
[38:23] check and make sure that we remain very
[38:26] humble because as brother Bob even
[38:28] mentioned in the Sunday School lesson
[38:30] God hides in Simplicity but then he
[38:32] reveals himself in the very same thing
[38:34] he's hiding in Satan loves to make the
[38:37] new birth complicated he does he loves
[38:39] to make healing complicated he loves to
[38:42] make forgiveness complicated he loves to
[38:44] make it complicated for you to even
[38:46] forgive
[38:47] yourself brother sometimes we get so
[38:50] hung up on the past and what we did and
[38:52] it's already in the sea of God's
[38:54] forgivness but God's waiting on you to
[38:56] forgive yourself
[38:58] because if he forgave you and he does
[39:01] but yet you can't forgive yourself
[39:03] you're keeping your own self from
[39:06] developing and
[39:09] growing so it's time that we go back to
[39:12] Simplicity now Revelation it when
[39:15] sometimes whenever as as whether you
[39:17] hear the prophet or the ministry preach
[39:18] the word and it seems to be so
[39:20] complicated to you then it's not a real
[39:23] Revelation to you yet because Revelation
[39:26] is simple
[39:27] sir whenever Jesus came and he asked
[39:30] Peter who do you say that I the son of
[39:32] man am it was not complicated to
[39:35] Peter but yet it was such a deep
[39:37] mysterious revelation God hid it from
[39:40] the wise and prudent but yet he revealed
[39:43] it to Bab such as would
[39:45] learn and you see the order of the
[39:47] scripture where where where Jesus
[39:48] whenever Paul make or excuse me whenever
[39:50] Peter makes a confession and Jesus said
[39:52] you know Upon This Rock Thou Art Peter
[39:55] and Upon This Rock I'll build my church
[39:57] and the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail
[39:59] against it I imagine that made Peter
[40:01] feel pretty good you know he didn't have
[40:04] the new birth yet so he might have his
[40:06] his brothers might have been quite
[40:07] impressed that wow Peter's got some
[40:09] Revelation but you find that a few
[40:11] verses later Jesus is saying the son of
[40:13] man's got to go to Jerusalem to be
[40:15] crucified and Peter begins to start
[40:18] rebuking him and what does Jesus say get
[40:20] thee behind me Satan yes sir right well
[40:23] John might have looked and said Peter I
[40:25] thought Peter was revelated now Jesus is
[40:27] is calling him
[40:29] Satan but see Peter was whenever Peter
[40:32] was talking about Jesus being who he was
[40:36] and and Jesus clarified or or or
[40:38] confirmed that he was correct and Upon
[40:40] This Rock Peter was got in a spiritual
[40:43] Channel but then Peter got carnal again
[40:45] and Jesus wasn't calling Peter Satan he
[40:48] was calling the spirit speaking through
[40:50] Peter trying to keep him from going to
[40:52] the
[40:53] Cross now humility the the definition
[40:56] here just to to to make sure we all have
[40:58] the understanding is the feeling or
[41:01] attitude that you have no special
[41:04] importance that makes you better than
[41:07] others it's the lack of
[41:10] Pride that within ourselves we're not to
[41:14] walk around and think I'm better than
[41:16] them people I'm better than this person
[41:19] I'm better than that you're
[41:22] not I'm not if there's anything good
[41:25] about us it's because of him amen now
[41:28] the sincerity and humility go go right
[41:31] hand in hand because the sincerity is a
[41:33] quality of being or state of being
[41:35] sincere honesty of Mind freedom from
[41:39] hypocrisy so we're to be sincere and
[41:41] what did the angel tell the tell the
[41:43] prophet when he seen that the vision of
[41:44] the mama there he said you've got to be
[41:46] more
[41:48] sincere and if the angel of God told the
[41:50] prophet messenger he's got to be more
[41:52] sincere then I believe we have got to be
[41:54] more sincere more sincere is a briide
[41:57] more sincere as
[42:00] individuals now again humility does not
[42:03] belittle
[42:05] you or take away from who you are but it
[42:08] keeps the carnal perception of ourselves
[42:12] in check that's what humility does okay
[42:16] because there's a spiritual aspect that
[42:19] that we have to understand who we are
[42:21] that is what the ministry does and to
[42:23] preach and to remind the bride who you
[42:26] are but there's a special part of that
[42:28] and it's in him amen because in
[42:31] ourselves we're
[42:33] nothing so see there there's it's to
[42:35] keep the human Spirit and the Flesh in
[42:38] check to make us think that we're
[42:41] somebody but whenever we get in the
[42:44] spirit we realize that we're nothing and
[42:46] it's all about
[42:47] him when we get on the other side it's
[42:50] not about how big your crown is and how
[42:52] many gems it's got and how shiny it is
[42:55] and how loud oh you know
[42:57] the the the the Applause will be there's
[42:59] only one thing we want to hear it was
[43:02] well done thou good and faithful
[43:06] servant that's
[43:08] all it doesn't matter then as long as
[43:11] you fulfilled your God's desire and
[43:14] God's will in your life that's all that
[43:18] matters God's will for your life may not
[43:21] be to minister the word it may not be to
[43:23] play an instrument it may be to amen the
[43:25] word amen and and it may be your faith
[43:28] that God anoints you with and yet your
[43:30] faith you're sitting in the back corner
[43:32] and your faith is pulling on the gifts
[43:34] of God
[43:35] right and because your faith is pulling
[43:38] on the gift of God somebody gets their
[43:40] healing up
[43:41] here you see you have a part in every
[43:45] single
[43:48] service in every single service you have
[43:50] a
[43:51] part now this this this this constantly
[43:55] we have to check ourselves is for the
[43:56] young people people it's for the middle
[43:57] AG it's for the elderly it's for all age
[44:00] groups we must humble ourselves more
[44:03] than ever amen we must keep in constant
[44:06] check Lord am I pleasing
[44:09] you we have to open up every door of the
[44:13] heart now in the sermon what when he out
[44:16] to see brother R speaking he says now a
[44:18] lot of people has the wrong impression
[44:20] of Christ some people thinks that Christ
[44:23] was a Christ was the greatest of
[44:26] all men
[44:28] he was the example man Not only was he
[44:30] man but he was God man he was God With
[44:33] Us Emanuel he was humblest of
[44:36] men but you can be too humble you can
[44:39] get so humble until the devil would make
[44:41] a puppet Out of You Now understand this
[44:46] humility come on okay is this good all
[44:50] right thank
[44:51] you humility is not weakness on when the
[44:56] prophet is speaking of here is that
[44:58] people well bless God that Satan is
[45:00] trying to take away my my child from
[45:02] under under under under the token and or
[45:05] I'm claiming the token he don't have the
[45:06] Holy Ghost and Satan's trying to take
[45:08] him away but I'm just so humble I I I
[45:10] don't want to get angry at the
[45:12] Devil Satan is trying to attack my body
[45:15] with sickness but I'm just so humble
[45:20] God humility is not
[45:24] weakness humility is allowing yourself
[45:26] to be done wrong by
[45:28] others and Still Loving
[45:31] them and still forgiving them that's
[45:34] humility but yet when it came time when
[45:37] it came time for Jesus to fulfill the
[45:39] word he went straight to the Cross when
[45:42] it came time for Jesus to cast out the
[45:45] money changers he got right to work but
[45:47] yet he was so humble and he was so
[45:51] Meek he goes on he says he was humble
[45:53] enough to wash the disciples feet he was
[45:55] forgiving enough to pray for those who
[45:57] drove Stakes into his hands but he was
[46:00] man enough to Plat ropes and to run the
[46:02] money changers out of the
[46:05] house yet he loved he's our ultimate
[46:08] example When Jesus washed the disciples
[46:11] feet do you realize that Jesus washed
[46:13] Judas is the Kat's
[46:16] feet after he served the
[46:20] Passover and and no doubt none of none
[46:22] of the he Jesus even said this is my
[46:25] body which is broken for you and he
[46:27] began to go down the line of communion
[46:30] and Judas was there yet he had such love
[46:32] and such
[46:33] humility none of the other disciples
[46:36] Jesus told them Point Blank he who dips
[46:39] the soop that's who betrays me and they
[46:41] still didn't get
[46:42] it because of his love and humility and
[46:45] then he begins to to wash the disciples
[46:47] feet and Peter and John and Matthew and
[46:51] then he goes to Judas is a
[46:54] carat and washed his feet knowing that
[46:58] the next time them feet are going to
[47:00] move is going to be to betray
[47:04] him but he was no pushover Jesus knew
[47:08] exactly who Judas was he knew who Judas
[47:10] was when he called
[47:13] him so now there's a difference between
[47:15] hump being humble and a
[47:17] coward a coward is actually
[47:20] afraid but a humble person is brave and
[47:23] very capable and does what's necessary
[47:26] but they don't go about bragging about
[47:27] it
[47:29] right you look at Saul versus David Saul
[47:32] looked apart but he was a coward brother
[47:34] bam said so here you have David who was
[47:37] capable but after he killed Goliath he
[47:39] didn't go around he went back he went
[47:41] back to his father's
[47:43] house and then Saul would have him at at
[47:45] the castle or the palace and so forth
[47:48] but he didn't go around bragging about
[47:50] it so David was humble with it so that
[47:54] the the strain of Fallen man
[47:58] is always a desire the new birth that's
[48:00] why we have to be born again is always
[48:02] to have more or be better at something
[48:04] than the next
[48:05] person now playing in sports and
[48:08] competing and you want you know you're a
[48:09] good sport of course you're going to try
[48:11] to win this isn't saying don't even try
[48:13] and win but this is our approach to life
[48:16] we must always remain
[48:18] humble if God anoints you and you're
[48:20] anointed to sing or you're anointed to
[48:22] play an instrument or you're anointed to
[48:24] minister you're anointed to do whatever
[48:25] it may be
[48:27] we have to be humble about
[48:30] it Mary
[48:32] Magdalene there were seven Devils cast
[48:35] out of Mary
[48:36] Magdalene and brother Ram actually
[48:38] points out too as being pride and
[48:42] envy that she thought she was so pretty
[48:45] there was no one like her Satan knows
[48:47] where to try and hit
[48:49] you he knows where to hit
[48:52] you he knows where your weak spots are
[48:55] and he knows and and and that's the
[48:57] thing is that whenever like for example
[48:59] whenever somebody says something to you
[49:01] that's not very nice or you don't
[49:03] appreciate whether they realize it or
[49:04] not you have to let it roll
[49:07] off like water on a duck's back we've
[49:09] all heard that
[49:11] expression let it roll off because if
[49:14] you let it soak in then that begin then
[49:16] Satan latches itself on that because
[49:18] remember a cancer is a bruised cell and
[49:21] when one brother BR would say that the
[49:23] cell would
[49:24] backslide and when it would begin to
[49:26] backslide they would it would start to
[49:28] spread and start building on top of one
[49:31] another well that's what complexes do
[49:34] that's what even if it was genuinely a
[49:37] wrong word spoken if you don't let it
[49:40] slide off it will then become a bruised
[49:43] hurt cell in you're a human
[49:47] spirit and then Satan comes beyond that
[49:50] behind that and he'll attach this to it
[49:53] and then he'll attach that to it and
[49:54] then he'll attach that to it and before
[49:56] you know it you've got a
[49:59] network of of
[50:01] complexes so you have to let it roll Let
[50:04] It Roll right into the blood of Jesus
[50:06] Christ and keep yourself
[50:09] pure because if if if we keep things in
[50:11] our heart and then we come in and and
[50:13] and and we hear the
[50:15] word if you if if we have that on our
[50:18] hearts you cannot grow you'll stay right
[50:22] there
[50:24] unforgiveness will kill your prayers
[50:27] that's from the words of Jesus Christ
[50:29] himself
[50:31] right just like on the other side of
[50:34] that whenever somebody pays you a
[50:37] compliment and tells you you did
[50:40] wonderful appreciate
[50:42] it but then let it
[50:47] roll you're a wonderful singer you bless
[50:51] my heart you you touch my soul give God
[50:54] the glory
[50:57] let it
[51:00] roll that was the most wonderful sermon
[51:02] I've ever heard you're my favorite
[51:05] preacher give God the
[51:08] glory Let It
[51:11] Roll because just like complexes will
[51:14] build
[51:15] up so will
[51:18] pride and then Pride will then turn to
[51:21] arrogancy
[51:23] and then it'll go from that was such a
[51:25] wonderful song you did so great you sang
[51:28] so wonderful and you let it hold on to
[51:31] you and then the next time something
[51:32] else builds the next time something else
[51:33] builds and before you know it you're the
[51:35] best singer in the
[51:38] church how dare they call that person up
[51:40] there and saying they didn't call me
[51:42] don't they know that I get people
[51:46] blessed you see Satan will build on
[51:50] that we've got to keep oursel humble let
[51:52] it roll
[51:54] off because when you really get in the
[51:56] presence of God when you really get in
[51:59] the presence of God you will quickly
[52:02] realize it's all about
[52:06] him you will quickly realize that
[52:09] worship is not how well you can sing how
[52:12] if you dance or if you don't if you
[52:14] speak in tongues or if you don't you
[52:16] really realize that it's all about
[52:19] him amen church is all about
[52:24] him Heaven is all about him
[52:27] him it's all him like brother said he
[52:29] said get a cup of water and fill it up
[52:32] with water and then you put your finger
[52:34] in there and you take it out and see
[52:36] where the hole is he said that's how
[52:38] important you
[52:41] are that's how important we are
[52:45] naturally
[52:47] speaking in First Peter 5 P first Peter
[52:51] 5:5 likewise ye younger submit
[52:54] yourselves unto the Elder yay all of you
[52:56] be subject one to another and be clothed
[52:59] with
[53:00] humility this is Peter saying this Peter
[53:04] had to learn
[53:06] this for God resisteth the proud and he
[53:10] giveth grace to the humble humble
[53:13] yourselves under the mighty hand of God
[53:16] that he may exalt you in due time
[53:19] casting all your care upon him for he
[53:22] carth for
[53:25] you in the sermon perfect strength by
[53:27] Perfect weakness he said I hope that
[53:30] gets down deep to us both here in the
[53:32] tape world too that you realize that you
[53:35] you've got to become
[53:38] nothing not a know-it-all not a great
[53:41] somebody but a
[53:43] nobody you got to become dust you got to
[53:47] get to a place where you know that
[53:50] you're
[53:52] nothing and don't never rise above that
[53:57] for as soon as you rise above it you
[53:59] rise above God you've got to keep
[54:02] yourself in the dust and on the road to
[54:04] Damascus you've got to keep yourself off
[54:07] your high horse from the poorest of us
[54:10] to the richest of us from the least to
[54:11] the greatest we keep God out of our
[54:14] Lives because of our own selves I've
[54:17] often said the greatest enemy I've got
[54:18] is William brandham he's the one that
[54:21] gets in God's
[54:22] way he's the one that gets lazy he's the
[54:25] one that gets to a place sometimes where
[54:26] he thinks he can do something about it
[54:28] and when he does that shoves God right
[54:30] out of the picture but when I get rid of
[54:33] that guy when I get to a place that he's
[54:36] out of the way then God can come over
[54:38] and do things William brandham knows
[54:40] nothing
[54:41] about that's when God can use you that's
[54:46] that's when he can use any of you he can
[54:48] use anybody when we get out of his way
[54:52] but as long as we got ourselves in the
[54:53] way then we cannot
[54:57] this message does not teach us to
[54:59] exclude one
[55:00] another this message teaches us to draw
[55:02] a circle
[55:04] bigger remember that preacher that came
[55:06] to brother brandom and said well I I'm
[55:07] I'm drawing a circle and you're out
[55:09] because of his Doctrine what did the
[55:11] prophet say he said I'll draw a circle
[55:12] and draw you right back
[55:15] in because if we're if we're if we're
[55:18] drawing circles and we're trying to cut
[55:20] people
[55:21] out how do you know that you're not
[55:24] actually wrong
[55:26] right and the person that you're cutting
[55:28] out could help you if you would only
[55:30] make the circle bigger or maybe you
[55:33] could help them amen big you could help
[55:36] them if you kept the circle bigger then
[55:37] they don't quite see it like I do
[55:38] something that's
[55:40] it come on you see we have to Humble
[55:42] ourselves Lord if I'm wrong then you
[55:45] help me amen but if I can help that
[55:49] brother or sister then you help me help
[55:51] them and help me humble
[55:54] myself and not not you know not walk
[55:57] around with a spirit of arrogancy
[55:59] now brother speaking of St Martin he
[56:02] said talking about what a great man he
[56:04] was and he says yet in the very secret
[56:06] of his power was in humility before God
[56:10] that's the secret of power is
[56:14] humility and we find today that the
[56:16] church yet teaching its power and
[56:18] teaching the signs to follow the
[56:19] believer yet we find them puffed out big
[56:21] me little you it isn't like that in the
[56:25] early church they were humble kind to
[56:27] one another and sweet in understanding
[56:31] amen that if somebody is wrong if you
[56:35] meet them out in the street they're your
[56:36] coworker yet your atmosphere is so
[56:39] powerful and so convicting it draws
[56:43] them they may not have a clue what you
[56:46] believe but yet the the the atmosphere
[56:48] and the humility and the love that you
[56:50] walk in they don't know what you have
[56:53] but they want
[56:54] it it then begins to create a thirst in
[56:58] their lives that's true
[57:03] Christianity it's the the word of God is
[57:06] yes there's Doctrine and yes there's
[57:07] Revelation and it changes our heart it
[57:09] sets our soul on fire we're ready to go
[57:11] in the
[57:12] Rapture but yet at the end of the day if
[57:15] you if it's not shared in love if it's
[57:19] not lived out in humility then what good
[57:21] does it
[57:24] do it's got to have power behind
[57:27] it the word the the message has got
[57:31] power the message has got the authority
[57:33] the message is the life of Jesus Christ
[57:36] it is the gospel it is the Original Seed
[57:38] it's everything but yet in order the
[57:41] message has got to
[57:45] live the message is not to be weaponized
[57:47] and to cut one another it's to cut the
[57:50] enemy it's it's it's to be brought and
[57:53] believed in love and humility and to
[57:55] bring the elect lady in correction and
[57:58] in
[57:59] Purity it's to keep us pure the prophet
[58:03] said whenever we walk through the doors
[58:05] in case I don't get to that quote he
[58:07] said the reason that we should come to
[58:09] church is to find out where are our
[58:13] faults not will the minister entertain
[58:16] us today will my favorite singer be
[58:17] singing
[58:19] today will will the preacher preach
[58:22] something I've never heard before where
[58:24] am I falling short
[58:27] and how can I be more like
[58:31] Jesus because then if you realize that
[58:33] we're brother Bob if we are constantly
[58:36] Lord where am I falling short then we're
[58:38] not worried about where this person's
[58:39] falling short or that person's falling
[58:43] short it's where am I falling short and
[58:46] as the word Goes Forth if if that's why
[58:49] we have to come to church with an open
[58:51] heart because if we come with an Open
[58:53] Heart Lord show me where I'm wrong we
[58:55] could be doing something that's wrong
[58:56] and displeasing and have no
[58:59] idea we don't know but then as the word
[59:02] begins to come forth it begins to prick
[59:03] your heart if your heart is open because
[59:07] remember in the
[59:08] parable the F whenever Jesus is talking
[59:10] about the seed and how some fell on good
[59:12] ground and some fell on Rocky ground and
[59:13] all these things you you know the
[59:15] parable it's important every single one
[59:18] of us fall in one of them
[59:20] categories some fell on good ground you
[59:23] know some fell on
[59:24] rocks but it's important important that
[59:26] during the week we prepare our heart to
[59:28] hear the word it's important that come
[59:31] youall have a midweek service but in all
[59:33] week start praying for Wednesday night
[59:34] service on Thursday start praying for
[59:36] Sunday
[59:38] service because you're preparing you're
[59:40] tilling your heart if you wait till you
[59:42] walk through them doors to start getting
[59:43] ready for service and and you had a bad
[59:45] day on the job and a bad day with a
[59:47] neighbor and your your spirits all all
[59:50] crusted over and hard ground how's the
[59:52] seed going to get in there but when all
[59:55] week you we water it with praise and we
[59:57] keep it tilled up and we stay in the
[59:59] word and we stay under conviction of the
[1:00:00] word we're ready for
[1:00:03] church we're ready for the word to speak
[1:00:06] amen he said in the unwelcomed Christ he
[1:00:08] said you know what I've noticed this in
[1:00:10] my travels you usually find Great Men or
[1:00:14] little men now he he's talking about
[1:00:18] well you you you'll see he's not just
[1:00:19] talking naturally here I'll go around
[1:00:22] where there's great men really great men
[1:00:24] and I know they're great men but when I
[1:00:26] start to leave them they make you think
[1:00:28] you're the great man and they ain't
[1:00:32] nothing I guarantee you that if any one
[1:00:36] of us would go meet brother brandom if
[1:00:39] he was still here in the flesh you would
[1:00:41] leave after you spoke with him for just
[1:00:43] a few minutes brother Bob you would
[1:00:45] leave feeling like
[1:00:48] man it meant the world to him that he
[1:00:52] just spoke to
[1:00:54] me and Jesus is the same way he got that
[1:00:58] from
[1:01:00] Jesus to to to be like man I can't wait
[1:01:02] to to
[1:01:04] meet Jesus I I can't wait to speak you
[1:01:07] know you can imagine you were waiting if
[1:01:08] this was a brandom meeting and it is but
[1:01:11] if brother R Was Here In the Flesh and
[1:01:13] and and and he would come and you would
[1:01:14] just wait brother Bob to just meet him
[1:01:16] and shake his
[1:01:18] hand and yet when he spoke to you he
[1:01:21] felt like he was he would make you feel
[1:01:24] like he was the one waiting
[1:01:28] and that's not to exalt the man that was
[1:01:30] in his
[1:01:31] humility sir the love of God that was in
[1:01:35] him and that's in the bride then begins
[1:01:37] to raise you up you're actually the one
[1:01:41] that's edified when these brothers get
[1:01:43] up to preach and they're preaching and
[1:01:45] they study and they pray they find the
[1:01:46] mind of the Lord and they're all worn
[1:01:48] out and the devil has them tore up on
[1:01:51] Monday you're being you were blessed on
[1:01:54] Monday right you can go rejoicing on
[1:01:57] Monday what God did for you in the
[1:01:59] weekend when they had
[1:02:03] turmoil you see it was it's the spirit
[1:02:06] of Christ in them lifting by the word of
[1:02:09] the Lord lifting you up and you benefit
[1:02:13] from it because it's the body
[1:02:16] ministering to the
[1:02:18] body he said but you take a little 2x4
[1:02:21] don't know nothing he thinks he's all of
[1:02:23] it he ain't nothing to begin with he
[1:02:26] said it's great men are little men they
[1:02:28] never brag or take honor they make you
[1:02:31] feel that you're great that's great
[1:02:35] men and no doubt there's people and
[1:02:37] that's that goes for brothers and
[1:02:39] sisters there's people in our lives that
[1:02:41] we can look to and and and and and think
[1:02:43] about that maybe they already gone on to
[1:02:46] meet with to to be with the Lord but
[1:02:48] that's what kind of person they were
[1:02:49] think of the testimony and the Legacy
[1:02:51] that they leave behind athletes and and
[1:02:54] people in Hollywood and so-called
[1:02:55] influencers think they leave a legacy
[1:02:57] behind because of this score or this
[1:02:59] many fights won or whatever stats that
[1:03:03] perish a real Legacy is the legacy of
[1:03:07] Jesus
[1:03:09] Christ whenever you have a Praying
[1:03:11] Mother or a Praying
[1:03:13] father or a pastor that preaches for
[1:03:16] decades goes on to be with the Lord but
[1:03:17] the influence of what of his Works still
[1:03:20] follow that's a real Legacy brother
[1:03:22] Samuel Dell has got a legacy amen
[1:03:26] and here's the proof of the
[1:03:29] Legacy and you see it came through the
[1:03:33] word now God knows we we all how many
[1:03:37] fight a devil fight
[1:03:40] Satan we fight him every day he don't
[1:03:43] take a day
[1:03:44] off and neither should
[1:03:47] you Christians don't have days
[1:03:50] off so God will allow and he and he
[1:03:54] allows things in our lives
[1:03:56] and things that we have to fight and it
[1:03:58] may not be the same thing our whole
[1:03:59] lives it may be but there's always a
[1:04:02] battle why is there always a battle
[1:04:04] because you've got to always be humble
[1:04:07] amen that's right you know you start you
[1:04:09] start allowing yourself a to get uplift
[1:04:12] a little bit God will send
[1:04:14] something and then you got to start
[1:04:16] fighting right just like with Paul God
[1:04:19] gave him such Revelation he wrote most
[1:04:21] of the New Testament yet God allowed him
[1:04:24] a messenger of Satan to come and bother
[1:04:26] his eyes why he even admitted to keep
[1:04:28] him humble to keep him low unless he be
[1:04:32] exalted see it's still that human nature
[1:04:35] that we all have to
[1:04:38] fight because our soul our our excuse me
[1:04:40] our bodies and human Spirits are not
[1:04:42] redeemed
[1:04:43] yet so our souls that's that's where
[1:04:46] that's where where we have the weapons
[1:04:48] to
[1:04:49] fight so God allows things in our lives
[1:04:53] to keep us
[1:04:54] humble and some times things happen in
[1:04:56] life and it just Bob brother Bob it just
[1:04:59] takes so much out of you and but God
[1:05:02] ain't done yet he's still
[1:05:06] crushing and then more more oil comes
[1:05:09] out as it
[1:05:11] were more uh weakness or you know more
[1:05:15] more more tears more travail comes out
[1:05:18] of you and you say God I think I passed
[1:05:21] this but no you didn't not yet
[1:05:26] it's God humbling
[1:05:28] you it's God keeping you
[1:05:30] humble it's god making us
[1:05:35] humble now another sermon if you can
[1:05:37] listen to it is the perfect strength by
[1:05:39] Perfect weakness is very
[1:05:41] powerful but he says quite early on in
[1:05:43] the sermon he says the important thing
[1:05:45] one of the most important things that we
[1:05:47] must Master now remember this and
[1:05:49] especially you young preachers and lay
[1:05:51] members
[1:05:52] alike there's one thing we've got to
[1:05:54] master if we expect to fulfill God's
[1:05:56] desire in our life that is we have to
[1:05:59] master the thought of human
[1:06:03] ability I can do
[1:06:07] this I can do that you've got to master
[1:06:11] that you can't do it but yet you can do
[1:06:15] all
[1:06:16] things through
[1:06:19] Christ you see how you've got to do it
[1:06:21] through
[1:06:22] him he said and make he said if we ever
[1:06:25] get to a spot where we think we can do
[1:06:27] it with our own intelligence and our own
[1:06:29] abilities we've got to master in such a
[1:06:31] way that we get rid of that thing and
[1:06:33] lay it aside so that God can use
[1:06:37] us and it's a human struggle to conquer
[1:06:40] your own will and your ambition and your
[1:06:42] desires because as as humans we make
[1:06:45] plans we have Ambitions it's you know as
[1:06:48] long as it's in check it's good to be
[1:06:50] ambitious you most certainly don't want
[1:06:52] to be
[1:06:53] lazy that's terrible you want to be
[1:06:56] ambitious and L you know go out and and
[1:06:58] do things but you always want to keep
[1:07:01] that in check with God's will in your
[1:07:03] life and if it's God's will in your life
[1:07:06] even if you don't you know God Will Make
[1:07:09] A Way and then you can do all things so
[1:07:12] it so this idea and this thought this
[1:07:15] morning of humbling yourself and and
[1:07:17] realizing that we're nothing is not to
[1:07:19] put you down but it's to realize that we
[1:07:23] within our human abilities in ourselves
[1:07:25] elves are
[1:07:28] nothing but through him we're more than
[1:07:33] conquerors what is that John said
[1:07:35] greater is he that is in you than he
[1:07:37] that is in the world he didn't say
[1:07:39] greater are
[1:07:40] you the secret
[1:07:43] ingredient is
[1:07:46] him and he's humble and he's
[1:07:49] lovely and he's sweet and he's kind and
[1:07:52] he's corrective and he's the word and
[1:07:54] he's the truth and he's the way and he's
[1:07:56] the life but all these are secret
[1:07:59] elements and secret ingredients in the
[1:08:01] life of a holy ghost filled person that
[1:08:03] the world don't
[1:08:06] understand Jesus Christ was the rose of
[1:08:10] Sharon he was the perfect Lamb of God
[1:08:14] but he was crushed on
[1:08:17] Calvary his life his three and a half
[1:08:20] year Ministry was a
[1:08:22] crushing constantly crushing
[1:08:26] am they try to Stone him here they
[1:08:29] spread rumors here from birth really the
[1:08:32] Bible doesn't cover his young life but I
[1:08:34] guarantee you what do you see what do
[1:08:37] you think happened at school when he
[1:08:40] went what do you think the other kids
[1:08:42] said about him in
[1:08:44] school born of a virgin yeah
[1:08:48] right he had to deal with that his whole
[1:08:51] life his whole life all the way in his
[1:08:54] ministry
[1:08:57] the the the Pharisees and things mention
[1:08:58] it but he understands the oppression you
[1:09:00] have at school so that when you young
[1:09:02] people can go to school and you young
[1:09:03] girls get bullied or or get taunted
[1:09:05] rather for your long beautiful hair or
[1:09:07] your dress he
[1:09:09] understands when you little boys or you
[1:09:11] young young men get get you know at
[1:09:13] college or whatever stage or season of
[1:09:15] life you're in you may get ridiculed or
[1:09:18] ask questions he understands he's been
[1:09:21] through all
[1:09:23] that Paul said in Galatians 220 I am
[1:09:26] crucified with Christ nevertheless I
[1:09:28] live yet not I but Christ liveth in me
[1:09:31] and the life which I now live in the
[1:09:33] flesh I live by the faith of the Son of
[1:09:36] God who loved me and gave himself for me
[1:09:39] Paul also said that he died
[1:09:42] daily he dies daily we've got to die
[1:09:45] every
[1:09:47] day every day you've got we've got to
[1:09:49] die in Proverbs 16:18 Pride goeth Before
[1:09:54] Destruction
[1:09:55] and a hotty spirit before a
[1:09:58] fall better is it to be of a humble
[1:10:00] spirit with the lowly than toi than to
[1:10:02] divide the spoil with the
[1:10:05] proud our minds go to King
[1:10:09] Uzziah he was a blessed man an old
[1:10:11] testament King there during the days of
[1:10:12] Isaiah he was a blessed man and he he
[1:10:15] was in his place and God blessed him
[1:10:17] with riches and authority and he was the
[1:10:19] king over Israel but then he began to be
[1:10:24] lifted up
[1:10:26] the Bible would say when he was strong
[1:10:28] his heart was lifted up to his
[1:10:32] destruction God called him to be king
[1:10:35] and God blessed him in his place but he
[1:10:38] was so blessed and he would not humble
[1:10:39] himself so that then he began to be what
[1:10:41] else can I
[1:10:42] do what else can I do and as we know the
[1:10:45] story he he began he
[1:10:48] intruded into the priest's
[1:10:50] office and he went into the temple and
[1:10:52] the priest tried to stop him he went to
[1:10:54] go sa to make I believe it was to burn
[1:10:56] incense or to bring to bring yeah to
[1:10:59] burn incense and he was going to the
[1:11:01] priest try to stop him stop him but he
[1:11:02] said I'm King I can do what I want and
[1:11:05] he went in there and he he tried to
[1:11:07] fulfill the office of a priest and God
[1:11:08] struck him with Leprosy
[1:11:11] immediately and we know that leprosy is
[1:11:13] a type of
[1:11:15] sin so it's important that we stay in
[1:11:17] our place and that affect that affected
[1:11:20] Uzziah I'm sorry Isaiah so much that he
[1:11:24] that he had a vision
[1:11:26] the year that Uzziah died he saw the
[1:11:27] Lord sitting on a throne Isaiah 61 upon
[1:11:30] a throne high and lifted up and his
[1:11:32] train fill the temple see what when when
[1:11:36] that happened to Uzziah That Shook
[1:11:38] Isaiah up they were very good friends
[1:11:40] that shook Isaiah up so
[1:11:42] much he then begin to examine his own
[1:11:46] place before
[1:11:47] God and he begin to have a vision and he
[1:11:50] seen God and you know s High and lifted
[1:11:52] up on his throne he begin to see the
[1:11:54] order of the chair and all the worship
[1:11:56] that was going for him and the in the
[1:11:59] worship and in verse 5 then said I woe
[1:12:02] is me for I am undone because I am a man
[1:12:06] of unclean lips and I dwell in the midst
[1:12:10] of un of of a people of unclean lips
[1:12:13] Isaiah begin to Humble himself being a
[1:12:16] word Prophet he's the one that gave the
[1:12:18] prophecy of a virgin shall con
[1:12:20] see and yet whenever he seen God and he
[1:12:23] realized that it was actually all about
[1:12:27] him the seraphim the Train the temple
[1:12:30] the whole Temple that they had there
[1:12:32] where Uzziah went to try and was struck
[1:12:34] down with lepry all that reflected
[1:12:36] him Moses's Temple reflected him the Ark
[1:12:40] of the Covenant reflects him the Mana
[1:12:43] reflects him Moses was to build a
[1:12:46] tabernacle and he did after a pattern of
[1:12:49] what he seen in and what God showed him
[1:12:52] it's all about him
[1:12:55] whenever the 12 tribes were set in the
[1:12:57] wilderness they were gathered around the
[1:12:59] ark around
[1:13:01] him whenever he came to Earth he had 12
[1:13:04] disciples that were gathered around him
[1:13:07] it's all about
[1:13:09] him now there's so much power and and
[1:13:13] we're going to try and go a little
[1:13:14] quicker just for the sake of time here
[1:13:17] but the power of humility is so powerful
[1:13:21] when we humble
[1:13:22] ourselves that it even helps the the
[1:13:26] wicked you say what do you mean Ahab was
[1:13:30] became an enemy to
[1:13:32] God and he went and he stole nebo's
[1:13:34] Vineyard and and and and Jezebel went
[1:13:37] and Rose up false Witnesses and stoned
[1:13:39] and killed an innocent man a man that
[1:13:41] refused to sell his father's inheritance
[1:13:45] his inheritance the land of his fathers
[1:13:47] he
[1:13:49] refused to sell his inheritance amen and
[1:13:52] Jezebel and Ahab comes and he mopes
[1:13:55] around and and Jezebel ask him what's
[1:13:57] wrong he won't eat and he just got the
[1:13:59] wowy wowy
[1:14:01] Woos and Jezebel said you you just hang
[1:14:04] tight here I'll get that I'll get that
[1:14:06] that Vineyard for you and she went and
[1:14:09] had two worshippers of bail come and and
[1:14:11] and you know come up false witness and
[1:14:13] the elders they stoned Ahab and then
[1:14:16] Elijah he could they couldn't hide from
[1:14:18] God Elijah came and pronounced judgment
[1:14:19] and told Ahab that the dogs would lick
[1:14:21] your
[1:14:22] blood and the dogs would eat Jezebel
[1:14:26] and yet that that that because Ahab was
[1:14:28] an
[1:14:30] Israelite a backsliding Israelite and
[1:14:32] that prophecy he knew Elijah's prophecy
[1:14:35] was right he knew it was going to come
[1:14:37] to pass and he he began to Humble
[1:14:41] himself before God now God wasn't going
[1:14:45] to change his word of what he already
[1:14:46] said but Ahab humbling himself so much
[1:14:50] that God actually sent Elijah back and
[1:14:52] said because he humbleth himself before
[1:14:55] me I will not bring the evil in his days
[1:14:58] but in his son's days will I bring the
[1:15:00] evil upon his
[1:15:03] house so Ahab who became an enemy to God
[1:15:07] humbled himself and had a little
[1:15:10] reprieve how about when when you as a
[1:15:12] son or a daughter of God humble yourself
[1:15:15] before
[1:15:16] God God had humble
[1:15:19] Moses 40 years man put all that into him
[1:15:23] and it took God 40
[1:15:26] years to take it out of
[1:15:29] them and at the end of that 40 years he
[1:15:31] was finally ready to be an empty vessel
[1:15:34] and go down and fulfill the word of
[1:15:36] God in Second Kings the scripture tells
[1:15:39] us of a
[1:15:40] story by a widow woman let's read 2
[1:15:42] Kings
[1:15:44] 4:1 now there cried a certain woman of
[1:15:46] the wives of the sons of the prophets
[1:15:49] unto Elisha saying thy servant my
[1:15:51] husband is dead and thou knowest that
[1:15:53] thy servant did fear the lord and the
[1:15:55] Creditor is come to take unto him my son
[1:15:58] take unto him my two sons to be bondmen
[1:16:01] and Elisha said unto her what shall I do
[1:16:03] for thee tell me what H has thou in thy
[1:16:05] house and she said thine handmaid hath
[1:16:08] not anything in the house save a pot of
[1:16:11] oil then he said go borrow the vessels
[1:16:13] of all thy neighbors even empty vessels
[1:16:18] borrow not a few and when thou art come
[1:16:21] in then shalt thou shut the door upon
[1:16:23] thee and upon thy sons and and thou
[1:16:25] shalt pour into all those vessels and th
[1:16:27] shalt set aside that which is full so
[1:16:31] she went from him and shut the door upon
[1:16:33] her and her sons who brought the vessels
[1:16:35] to her and she poured out and it came to
[1:16:38] pass when the vessels were full that she
[1:16:40] said unto her son bring me yet a vessel
[1:16:42] and he said unto her there is not a
[1:16:44] vessel more and the oil stayed then she
[1:16:47] came and told the man of God and he said
[1:16:49] go sell the oil and pay thy debt and
[1:16:52] live thou on thy Children of the
[1:16:55] rest she had to find empty
[1:16:59] vessels and that's what God
[1:17:01] wants he wants empty vessels not he
[1:17:04] don't want half full vessels where we
[1:17:06] put in our own ideas and our own
[1:17:08] understanding and our own preconceived
[1:17:09] ideas he wants empty vessels and in
[1:17:12] order for us to be empty vessels we've
[1:17:14] got to Humble
[1:17:15] ourselves we've got to become humble
[1:17:18] Lord I'm
[1:17:19] nothing everything I think I know I
[1:17:23] don't now now when God gives you
[1:17:25] Revelation it's yours don't
[1:17:27] misunderstand me it is yours and you
[1:17:29] have that Revelation but everything that
[1:17:31] I I'm so revelated I think I know God I
[1:17:35] don't know as I ought to know help me
[1:17:37] fill me with your
[1:17:40] word the prophet of God said oh God's
[1:17:43] strategy is to take empty human vessels
[1:17:47] and shake the world with
[1:17:49] them he wants to take empty human
[1:17:52] vessels and shake your family with it to
[1:17:55] shake your community to shake your
[1:17:57] co-workers let us be that empty
[1:18:00] vessel empty and humble so that he can
[1:18:03] pour oil and then we leave church we're
[1:18:05] full next weekend or Wednesday night
[1:18:08] we're empty again fill us back up on
[1:18:10] Sunday we're empty again you humble
[1:18:14] yourself and that's how you move on with
[1:18:17] God that is how you reach because God
[1:18:19] can have a a will and he can have a
[1:18:22] desire for our lives but we get in our
[1:18:25] way we get in his
[1:18:28] way think of what God can do with us as
[1:18:32] individuals and in our individual lives
[1:18:35] if we would humble ourselves
[1:18:38] more and that's from the front to the
[1:18:40] back and from side to side that's all of
[1:18:45] us on the days of Pentecost and
[1:18:47] disciples after Jesus went back to
[1:18:48] Heaven they had 10 days to empty out
[1:18:50] they had to become empty
[1:18:53] vessels you can see how whenever Jesus
[1:18:55] went brother Bob on the mountain
[1:18:56] Transfiguration and and with with J with
[1:18:59] Peter and J James and John and and he
[1:19:01] was transfigured and he seen Moses and
[1:19:02] Elijah you can see how Peter was still
[1:19:04] full Lord let us build a tabernacle here
[1:19:06] one for Moses one for Elijah one for you
[1:19:09] he had his own ideas still but on the
[1:19:11] days of Pentecost he emptied out and
[1:19:14] when the Holy Ghost came he was able to
[1:19:15] then say this is that which was spoken
[1:19:18] of by the prophet Joel then he was able
[1:19:20] to walk by the by the lame man at the
[1:19:22] gate called beautiful and said Silver
[1:19:23] and Gold Have I
[1:19:25] none but such as I have I give to you in
[1:19:29] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ rise
[1:19:31] up and
[1:19:32] walk and you could be sitting here in
[1:19:35] your own condition and whatever it may
[1:19:37] be and it can be a lame condition you're
[1:19:39] not walking to your full
[1:19:41] potential but let the word of God this
[1:19:43] morning say silver and gold to fix your
[1:19:46] problems Have I None but such as I have
[1:19:50] the word of God I give to you in the
[1:19:53] name of Jesus Christ
[1:19:55] rise up and walk it may not be healing
[1:19:58] it may what it may be a mind battle it
[1:20:00] may be something that you need may need
[1:20:02] the joy of the Lord in your heart you
[1:20:03] may need the joy of your salvation
[1:20:05] restored but in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:20:08] I give it unto you rise up and
[1:20:15] walk empty
[1:20:17] vessels that's what he wants when there
[1:20:20] were
[1:20:21] 120 empty vessels waiting on him
[1:20:26] how that must have made God
[1:20:29] feel to have 120 empty vests was that
[1:20:33] when he came
[1:20:35] down he filled each and every one of
[1:20:38] them nobody left that service empty
[1:20:41] nobody left that service saying well I
[1:20:43] didn't get
[1:20:44] nothing why because they were all
[1:20:50] empty there's something for us in each
[1:20:52] and every service
[1:20:55] even if it's just a little bit and
[1:20:56] that's what you need to watch for it may
[1:20:59] be the the interpretive reading that the
[1:21:00] brother gets up and reads may be
[1:21:02] something in the brother's prayer when
[1:21:04] he prays it may be in the song that the
[1:21:06] sister sings or the brother sing it may
[1:21:08] be in what the minister says there's
[1:21:11] something for you in every
[1:21:14] service but we have to Humble ourselves
[1:21:17] to get
[1:21:18] it to get what God has for
[1:21:22] us he said you know people want power
[1:21:25] this is in the sermon humble thyself and
[1:21:27] really they don't know what power is
[1:21:29] they don't really know what goes with it
[1:21:33] the Way Up Is Down
[1:21:36] always Now understand P God gives
[1:21:40] gifts and he gives gifts sovereignly and
[1:21:43] they're without um they're without
[1:21:47] repentance but when a person has a gift
[1:21:50] in their
[1:21:51] life that requires that much more
[1:21:54] steadfast of
[1:21:56] humility because the gift didn't come
[1:21:58] from them but Satan will make try and
[1:22:01] make you think that gift did come from
[1:22:03] you and you've got to always keep that
[1:22:06] covered because to whom much is given
[1:22:09] much is required you think of the
[1:22:11] humility there was no accident that
[1:22:12] brother R was so humble or Moses the
[1:22:14] Bible specifically said that Moses was
[1:22:16] so
[1:22:17] humble but he talked face to face with
[1:22:20] God he literally had the pillar of fire
[1:22:22] come down the Finger of God and write
[1:22:23] the Ten Commandments and stone he's seen
[1:22:26] that he's seen he's seen the back part
[1:22:27] of the man he's seen so
[1:22:30] much be it he had to constantly stay
[1:22:34] humble the prophet of God would would
[1:22:36] see such things because of his gift he
[1:22:39] would have brother Ryan people come
[1:22:41] behind him and Pat him on the shoulder
[1:22:42] and say I love you brother
[1:22:45] brand and he would know they
[1:22:48] wouldn't but he still had to love him
[1:22:51] and no one ever
[1:22:52] knew brother Billy Paul testified one
[1:22:55] time he said I knew my dad so well he
[1:22:57] said when somebody invited him to go
[1:22:58] fishing go hunting or invite him to
[1:23:00] meetings he could tell by the prophet's
[1:23:02] response he could tell by the prophet's
[1:23:04] response if he meant Billy get me out of
[1:23:08] this Billy I'd like to do it Billy maybe
[1:23:13] or Billy get this done ASAP that's how
[1:23:15] he knew his
[1:23:17] dad that
[1:23:19] well but yet he said one thing I never
[1:23:22] knew is a different between his
[1:23:25] enemies and his
[1:23:28] friends that's
[1:23:32] powerful a man that was so gifted by God
[1:23:36] that he could that he could look into
[1:23:38] your life and he could know if you were
[1:23:39] really sincere he know if you're a real
[1:23:42] believer and he would know when a
[1:23:44] hypocrite would come and tell him how
[1:23:46] much he loved him knowing he despised
[1:23:47] him and couldn't stand them but he still
[1:23:50] treated him with
[1:23:52] such so cordial
[1:23:55] now I'm not here to uplift the man but I
[1:23:58] am up here to uplift the god in the
[1:24:01] man and I'm also here to uplift the god
[1:24:04] in
[1:24:06] you that you can with a God in you we
[1:24:11] can all humble ourselves
[1:24:14] more because the human element
[1:24:18] can't but the god element
[1:24:21] can see he says if you want Power
[1:24:25] see how humble you can get just get away
[1:24:28] from all your worldly thinking and just
[1:24:29] and humble yourself before God God and
[1:24:33] then you've got more power than the man
[1:24:35] that runs all over the building and
[1:24:36] makes a lot of noise because you've been
[1:24:38] able to conquer
[1:24:40] yourself commit yourself to Christ see
[1:24:43] to humble yourself before him that's
[1:24:45] really power you showed me a church
[1:24:48] that's humble not real humble not an
[1:24:50] arrogancy a church just a sweet Humble
[1:24:54] Church
[1:24:54] church I'll show you a church that has
[1:24:57] the favor and power of
[1:24:59] God that's why he said he'd rather have
[1:25:02] rather than having a church with all the
[1:25:04] nine spiritual gifts constantly working
[1:25:06] he'd rather have a church that's just
[1:25:07] full of
[1:25:08] love
[1:25:10] amen because if there's no love to
[1:25:13] control the gifts there'll be
[1:25:16] competition there'll be arrogancy
[1:25:18] there'll be Pride but if there's
[1:25:21] love God can use you God God can use you
[1:25:25] God can use you God can use you and then
[1:25:28] when he's done using you you realize
[1:25:29] you're
[1:25:32] nothing and if he wants to use you you
[1:25:34] realize you're nothing but Lord if you
[1:25:36] want to use me I'm here for
[1:25:37] you but it's all about
[1:25:42] you that principle has got to work in
[1:25:45] marriage too and in your family the
[1:25:48] principle of humility and putting others
[1:25:51] first if you don't have that when you
[1:25:53] get married you're for a very rough time
[1:25:57] right now there's no big eyes and little
[1:26:00] use in the body of Christ
[1:26:02] right just like you shouldn't we
[1:26:05] shouldn't love our children one more
[1:26:06] than the
[1:26:09] other there's no big eyes or big use
[1:26:13] it's all about him God is the one that
[1:26:14] ordains things to be done by certain
[1:26:17] people but it's all
[1:26:21] him we don't want to ever get an
[1:26:23] arrogant spirit
[1:26:26] we know that arrogance is whenever we
[1:26:27] think we're better than somebody else
[1:26:29] the realization whenever we come to
[1:26:31] church and we hear the word preach and
[1:26:33] we just latch on to that and amen praise
[1:26:35] God we realize that and we realize we're
[1:26:39] elect and that is you know you hear the
[1:26:41] prophet make statements about when John
[1:26:43] seen his name in the book that's how you
[1:26:44] see your name in the book your name in
[1:26:46] the book isn't every seventh letter
[1:26:49] every eighth letter from this chapter to
[1:26:50] this chapter I see my name spelled out
[1:26:52] like it's some code yeah you see your
[1:26:55] name in the book whenever you identify
[1:26:58] and you believe the word for your age
[1:27:01] Which is far greater than you know
[1:27:04] having your literal
[1:27:06] name in the days of William Aaron
[1:27:09] Brandon when he shall begin a sound the
[1:27:10] voice of the mysteries of God should be
[1:27:13] finished well how many William Mary and
[1:27:15] Brams would there
[1:27:16] be but there's only one that could come
[1:27:20] with the life and the ministry and then
[1:27:24] it's our and then it's our God's grace
[1:27:27] Upon Our Lives that makes us realize
[1:27:29] that's the
[1:27:30] Elijah just like when Jesus came to
[1:27:32] Earth it wasn't Jesus Christ of Nazareth
[1:27:35] there were hints dropped but it was not
[1:27:37] Behold a virgin shall conceive with
[1:27:39] Jesus Christ of Nazareth and then he's
[1:27:41] going to go here and he's going to do
[1:27:42] this he's going to do that there could
[1:27:43] have been carnal man that tried to make
[1:27:45] that happen but when he came yes sir the
[1:27:49] generation of that day that identified
[1:27:52] Thou Art the Christ the son of the
[1:27:54] Living God that proved their
[1:27:58] election so when we realize that it's a
[1:28:02] humbling
[1:28:05] experience that God out of out of seven
[1:28:07] billion people on the Earth not only
[1:28:09] saved me but he elected me to be part of
[1:28:12] his
[1:28:13] bride I can see this and maybe my own
[1:28:17] family can't my own co-workers people I
[1:28:19] love can't see it but I see it
[1:28:24] that is a very humbling
[1:28:29] experience because you realize who am
[1:28:33] I what about people that are more
[1:28:36] qualified what about people that came
[1:28:38] from a good home and here I came from a
[1:28:40] broken home I came off the streets I
[1:28:42] came I you know I I came from the worst
[1:28:45] condition and possibility there was in
[1:28:48] life right and yet you have people that
[1:28:52] were raised in the most perfect good
[1:28:53] homes that are living very evil lives be
[1:28:57] it God calls them from here and he calls
[1:28:59] them from
[1:29:00] there but you realize in
[1:29:05] humility that we're
[1:29:08] nothing we should have the ability to
[1:29:10] Humble ourselves and receive the word
[1:29:12] regardless of who it comes
[1:29:15] through if it's your favorite preacher
[1:29:17] or if it's your not favorite preacher we
[1:29:19] should have the ability to discern
[1:29:21] that's God speaking to me
[1:29:24] that you that that's
[1:29:28] humble that's humble God I don't care
[1:29:31] who speaks it I don't care if a child
[1:29:33] says something to me on the way
[1:29:35] up I don't care who says it I don't care
[1:29:39] if it's through a song but God you spoke
[1:29:41] to
[1:29:42] me the person never has to know you can
[1:29:45] tell them that'll encourage them I don't
[1:29:47] now don't get me wrong it encourages
[1:29:49] ministers to know that their seron
[1:29:50] blessed
[1:29:51] you remember brother B meeting
[1:29:54] was being complimented on a sermon and
[1:29:57] another preacher no doubt jealous said
[1:29:59] bless God I won't want them
[1:30:01] complimenting me and brother R looked to
[1:30:03] him he said there's only one difference
[1:30:04] between me and you I like he said I like
[1:30:07] it he said but there's one difference
[1:30:08] between me and you he said I'll admit
[1:30:12] it why but see again you appreciate it
[1:30:16] and you let it
[1:30:17] roll and the reason is
[1:30:20] because it gives whenever Minister speak
[1:30:23] speak something to your heart it
[1:30:24] encourages them to know that it spoke to
[1:30:26] your heart because there's plenty the
[1:30:28] devil tells
[1:30:29] them there's plenty the devil tells them
[1:30:32] the opposite
[1:30:33] way so if a child of God in all honesty
[1:30:37] and sincerity comes and says that
[1:30:38] blessed my heart
[1:30:40] today that equips
[1:30:43] them but then you let it
[1:30:48] roll because remember the
[1:30:50] wheat whenever it's still green
[1:30:54] it sticks straight
[1:30:56] up but whenever it begins to
[1:30:59] mature and all the greenness is baked
[1:31:02] out that head begins to Bow like
[1:31:06] this there was no greater man on the
[1:31:08] scene with more Revelation than brother
[1:31:11] brown but he was the most
[1:31:16] humble we don't walk around all puffed
[1:31:19] up and
[1:31:21] uplifted see the bride was been given
[1:31:23] very special
[1:31:25] Grace so we are to we should be able to
[1:31:27] be humble enough to give that Grace to
[1:31:30] others and not just to people in our own
[1:31:33] church but even to our neighbors and to
[1:31:35] other people we're not to walk around
[1:31:36] puffed up and uplifted well bless God
[1:31:38] I'm a message believer and all of you
[1:31:40] are Canon
[1:31:41] fathered that's not
[1:31:44] right this message is sent to the
[1:31:48] bride but there's lots tens of thousands
[1:31:51] millions throughout the ages that will
[1:31:53] be be there in heaven as
[1:31:57] saved there will be people in our
[1:31:59] generation that will be there saved that
[1:32:02] have never heard a tape right that I've
[1:32:04] never heard the
[1:32:07] message but yet God called you to escape
[1:32:10] the tribulation now they're going to
[1:32:11] have to go through tribulation and
[1:32:12] there's there's process they're going to
[1:32:13] have to be at the white Throne judgment
[1:32:15] and God's going to give them eternal
[1:32:16] life they're going to enter there cuz
[1:32:19] he's that kind of merciful god so that's
[1:32:22] you know you work with other people you
[1:32:24] act with people and they're such good
[1:32:25] people and they love God and they serve
[1:32:27] God the best of their abilities well
[1:32:28] don't don't cut them out they may not be
[1:32:31] bride but we should never put them
[1:32:35] down God has an
[1:32:38] economy in the scripture Jesus refers to
[1:32:41] a story between a Publican a Publican
[1:32:43] were Tax
[1:32:47] Collectors Tax Collectors are never
[1:32:52] liked brother John you're you said you
[1:32:54] were an accountant you're just a
[1:32:55] middleman
[1:32:59] there but the actual tax collector
[1:33:01] nobody sends the IRS a Christmas gift
[1:33:04] has anybody done
[1:33:06] that nobody enjoys it so imagine the
[1:33:11] publicans were many times Jews that
[1:33:13] actually collected taxes that made it
[1:33:15] even worse it's one thing that to be a
[1:33:17] Jew and you have to go up and you got to
[1:33:19] pay the Roman system taxes but whenever
[1:33:22] the the kid you grew up in school
[1:33:23] actually is now your tax
[1:33:26] collector oh man that that's hard they
[1:33:29] were looked on with contempt they were
[1:33:31] ordinary the the I looked this up online
[1:33:33] but ordinary taxes such as land taxes
[1:33:35] were collected by the Roman officials
[1:33:36] but toll taxes for transporting goods
[1:33:38] were usually collected by Jews under
[1:33:41] contract with the Romans they were
[1:33:42] looked at as Traders now that was
[1:33:43] Matthew Matthew was a Publican he was a
[1:33:46] tax collector and Jesus chose
[1:33:48] him so Jesus tells the story here about
[1:33:51] a Publican and about it was like a a
[1:33:54] religious person and one went down and
[1:33:56] he went and he he went to the temple to
[1:33:58] pray and he he went and he went there
[1:33:59] all arrogant he said God I'm so thankful
[1:34:01] I'm not a murderer I'm so thankful I'm
[1:34:04] not like this person I'm not like that
[1:34:06] person and I see a Publican over there
[1:34:08] I'm so glad I'm not like that guy man
[1:34:11] not a traitor to my country thank you
[1:34:13] Lord I'm not amen and he just walks out
[1:34:17] just his stuff shirt and as aun as ever
[1:34:19] but yet you have that Publican that was
[1:34:20] sitting there in the
[1:34:22] corner and he so humbled himself he felt
[1:34:25] bad for what he was doing and he so
[1:34:27] humbled himself the scripture said that
[1:34:28] he wouldn't even look up to heaven he
[1:34:30] was so humble he had his head down he
[1:34:32] said Lord I'm not even worthy to look up
[1:34:35] and Jesus said he said and the Publican
[1:34:38] standing a far off would not so much as
[1:34:40] lift up his eyes into heaven but smoted
[1:34:43] his breath saying God be merciful to me
[1:34:44] a sinner I tell you this man went down
[1:34:47] to his house Justified rather than the
[1:34:49] other for everyone that exalteth himself
[1:34:52] shall be abased and he that humbleth
[1:34:54] himself shall be
[1:34:56] exalted he humbled himself we're coming
[1:34:59] up on Christmas time and we know that
[1:35:03] Jesus wasn't born on Christmas day but
[1:35:06] we take it as a day of worship and we we
[1:35:08] just begin to appreciate we take time
[1:35:12] the prophet said you you could do it if
[1:35:14] you want to do it in April do it if you
[1:35:15] want but Christmas because of of the
[1:35:17] tradition and how it's been that's
[1:35:19] usually the time we really stop to think
[1:35:20] about it and it should be a day of
[1:35:22] worship and we thank God for what he did
[1:35:25] because had there been no Christmas
[1:35:27] there'd be no Easter and had there been
[1:35:29] no Easter there wouldn't be
[1:35:32] us but that is the he is the most
[1:35:35] ultimate example of humility as we come
[1:35:37] to a
[1:35:38] close you see as we read the vision that
[1:35:41] Isaiah had of him so holy the seraphim
[1:35:44] and how they worshiped him and and and
[1:35:46] you know holy holy holy constantly and
[1:35:48] yet a god like that would
[1:35:50] leave that environment brother Bob that
[1:35:54] all of
[1:35:55] Heaven to brother Terence to come down
[1:35:59] in
[1:36:01] flesh flesh is
[1:36:04] humiliating our flesh is
[1:36:08] humiliating and you especially realize
[1:36:12] that as you change seasons of
[1:36:14] life and Jesus
[1:36:17] aged he had the humiliation of of of the
[1:36:21] Aging he had the humiliation of sickness
[1:36:24] because he bore our infirmities Jesus
[1:36:26] got
[1:36:27] sick he might have just healed somebody
[1:36:29] of leprosy and he might have walked away
[1:36:31] with a with a
[1:36:34] migraine because he bore her infirmities
[1:36:36] but he came from glory to Earth so that
[1:36:39] we could go from Earth to
[1:36:41] Glory brother called it a super sign
[1:36:44] when he said Jehovah was crying in a
[1:36:46] Manger in a
[1:36:49] barn from glory to the barn
[1:36:55] he suffered pain he suffered
[1:36:57] disappointments sickness
[1:37:00] Temptation he washed the disciples Dirty
[1:37:03] Feet brother man preached a sermon
[1:37:05] called
[1:37:07] Pride whenever that Pharisee had Jesus
[1:37:09] come and invited him because that
[1:37:13] Pharisee was arrogant and he wanted to
[1:37:15] show all of
[1:37:17] his his friends all of his social
[1:37:20] standing that were very curious about
[1:37:22] Jesus they wanted he wanted to put on a
[1:37:24] show for them and he purposely left
[1:37:27] Jesus there with dirty
[1:37:30] feet Jesus didn't even leave he didn't
[1:37:33] storm up he didn't chew him out he
[1:37:34] didn't get in his face he didn't go even
[1:37:36] wash his own feet he just sat
[1:37:38] there
[1:37:41] humble because what you have to realize
[1:37:43] is Jesus didn't go there for Simon the
[1:37:48] Pharisee when he was sitting down there
[1:37:51] he was waiting that's he knew why they
[1:37:54] invited him you think about
[1:37:58] this to be invited to a
[1:38:01] gathering by people that were acting to
[1:38:03] be your friends put yourself in his
[1:38:06] shoes you're invited to go to a
[1:38:09] gathering and yet everybody's making fun
[1:38:11] of
[1:38:13] you everybody's laughing at you
[1:38:15] everybody's talking about you and you
[1:38:17] know
[1:38:18] it not only humanly did he know it but
[1:38:22] he was God he knew what the thought
[1:38:23] thoughts were but yet he sat there any
[1:38:26] one of us would just leave we might as
[1:38:27] well leave that but he sat right
[1:38:30] there in
[1:38:32] humility because he was looking for a
[1:38:36] woman and when that woman came she had
[1:38:38] to Humble
[1:38:40] herself she had to Humble herself now
[1:38:44] she didn't have to Humble herself in the
[1:38:46] way of bringing of I'm So Elite and I'm
[1:38:48] so high class she had to Humble herself
[1:38:50] in a way of I'm so
[1:38:54] dirty he's going to know how I got this
[1:38:59] money but yet she had to get past her
[1:39:03] fight her own struggle to fight past
[1:39:07] that to get to his
[1:39:08] feet right so she had to Humble herself
[1:39:11] in that way to say I don't care he's
[1:39:14] going to know where I got this money but
[1:39:15] I've got to do
[1:39:19] this she had
[1:39:21] church because she she realized whenever
[1:39:25] she was washing his feet she realized
[1:39:29] that it was just her and
[1:39:31] him and it was all about
[1:39:34] him it wasn't about how messy my hair
[1:39:37] was getting it wasn't about how dirty my
[1:39:40] face was
[1:39:41] getting it was all about
[1:39:45] him may we this
[1:39:48] morning ask the Lord to Humble us more
[1:39:51] than ever before amen
[1:39:54] am be more humble be more
[1:39:58] sincere have more love because Isaiah
[1:40:01] tells us that we are all as an unclean
[1:40:03] thing and all of our righteousness are
[1:40:05] as filthy
[1:40:08] rags the best thing that we have that we
[1:40:11] could give him is as filthy
[1:40:13] rags in Isaiah 648 he says but now oh
[1:40:17] Lord Thou Art our father and we are the
[1:40:20] clay thou are our Potter and and we are
[1:40:24] the work of thy
[1:40:26] hand in Jeremiah 18:1 the word of the
[1:40:29] Lord came which came to Jeremiah from
[1:40:32] the Lord
[1:40:33] saying arise and go down to The Potter's
[1:40:36] House and there I will cause thee to
[1:40:39] hear my words then I went down to The
[1:40:41] Potter's House and behold he wrought a
[1:40:43] work on the wheels and the vessel that
[1:40:45] he made of clay was marred in the hand
[1:40:47] of the Potter so he made it again
[1:40:51] another vessel as seemed good to the
[1:40:55] Potter to make
[1:40:58] it we have to be
[1:41:01] remolded but it takes humility to do
[1:41:04] it you say well how how can I humble
[1:41:08] myself I have the desire to humble
[1:41:11] myself but how do I go about doing it it
[1:41:13] begins with
[1:41:15] repentance because for someone to get
[1:41:17] saved the first thing they have to do is
[1:41:18] stop and realize they're wrong admit
[1:41:21] they're wrong and turn around
[1:41:25] repent because whenever we repent and
[1:41:28] and you can sit here with the Holy Ghost
[1:41:30] for 30 years and we still have to
[1:41:33] repent because by repentance it's it's
[1:41:36] God's gift to us that we can keep
[1:41:38] ourselves
[1:41:39] clean we constantly keep ourselves
[1:41:41] washed out Lord I'm sorry if and then it
[1:41:45] can be even be sometimes things you
[1:41:46] can't put your finger on you know maybe
[1:41:48] you've kind of allowed Satan to attack
[1:41:50] you here and attack you there and you
[1:41:51] got to get that under the blood but
[1:41:53] sometimes you may not
[1:41:55] know so we open up our hearts brother R
[1:41:58] preached the door to the
[1:42:00] heart and we want to open up every door
[1:42:02] and he always went to that door of Pride
[1:42:05] and he said that's the big door right
[1:42:07] there but I want to say in the name of
[1:42:09] Jesus Christ Lord I open up my door of
[1:42:12] Pride and may you go in there and may
[1:42:14] you go in every door of my heart may he
[1:42:18] go in every door of your
[1:42:21] heart now here's the thing about Jesus
[1:42:23] in
[1:42:24] doors he'll knock on
[1:42:27] doors but he won't kick them
[1:42:32] in he's not he's not going to kick your
[1:42:34] door in but he'll knock he'll knock at
[1:42:37] this
[1:42:39] service and then you don't open it in
[1:42:42] the next service he'll be knocking
[1:42:44] again and you know the wonderful thing
[1:42:47] musicians can come on
[1:42:50] up the wonderful thing about our lord
[1:42:52] Jesus
[1:42:55] is that whenever we finally open the
[1:42:58] door and give up we're always so happy
[1:43:01] we
[1:43:03] did then it's like Lord I wish I would
[1:43:06] have done it
[1:43:09] sooner he wants to go in every door of
[1:43:11] our heart you know he said the prophet
[1:43:13] of God said talking about healing and
[1:43:15] love in 1 Corinthians
[1:43:17] 13 though I understand all Mysteries and
[1:43:20] though I you know my prayer faith heals
[1:43:22] the sick he said if I don't have love
[1:43:25] I'm
[1:43:26] nothing and brother R goes through the
[1:43:29] Beatitudes and he he speaks of those
[1:43:31] blessed are the poor in spirit for there
[1:43:32] is the Kingdom of Heaven blessed are
[1:43:35] they that mourn for they shall be
[1:43:36] comforted blessed are the meek for they
[1:43:38] shall inherit the earth blessed are they
[1:43:41] which do hunger and thirst for
[1:43:42] righteousness for they shall be filled
[1:43:44] blessed are the merciful for they shall
[1:43:45] obtain Mercy blessed are the pure in
[1:43:47] heart for they shall see God blessed are
[1:43:49] the peacemakers for they shall be called
[1:43:51] the children of God blessed are are they
[1:43:53] which are persecuted for righteousness
[1:43:55] sake for theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven
[1:43:56] blessed are ye when men shall revile you
[1:43:58] and persecute you and shall say all
[1:44:00] manner of evil against you falsely for
[1:44:02] my sake let me even throw in the
[1:44:04] Forgotten beatitude blessed is he that's
[1:44:06] not offended in me he said you take the
[1:44:10] Beatitudes and you mix it with Mark 16
[1:44:12] he said then you you got your
[1:44:17] healing right because all these require
[1:44:20] meekness
[1:44:23] the entire Plan of Redemption was botted
[1:44:26] up in one God man the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:44:28] there never was a man as
[1:44:30] humble and God help us this morning to
[1:44:32] be as humble as he
[1:44:34] was and it's not manufactured hum
[1:44:39] humility you get the spirit of Christ in
[1:44:42] you and it'll make you
[1:44:44] humble but you know the human Spirit In
[1:44:47] the Flesh that fights constantly that's
[1:44:50] where our Wars come from ain't that what
[1:44:51] James said from within us
[1:44:54] you have to
[1:44:56] extract humility from that Holy Ghost
[1:44:58] that God's given
[1:45:00] you that's where it comes
[1:45:04] from Brother Bob and sister Monica took
[1:45:06] us over there I can't pronounce the name
[1:45:07] of the of the Town donga
[1:45:13] Dela you can always tell when somebody's
[1:45:15] not
[1:45:16] local we can stand to our feet but he
[1:45:19] took us to a m there and and they showed
[1:45:21] you know how they used to kind of take
[1:45:22] out the gold and
[1:45:24] it was some intense work you know
[1:45:26] brother Bob and I were talking you know
[1:45:27] no matter how hard you think your job is
[1:45:29] now that was it's a cakewalk to what
[1:45:32] them poor guys had to do then you know
[1:45:34] but all that go was in the mountain and
[1:45:36] all they had to do was just keep
[1:45:37] chipping away keep chipping away and get
[1:45:40] that gold out the gold of God Is In You
[1:45:44] by the Holy Ghost and by the new birth
[1:45:47] but we've got to fight past our own
[1:45:48] flesh the laziness of our flesh we don't
[1:45:51] feel like praying we don't feel like
[1:45:52] reading we don't feel like studying
[1:45:54] we've got to fight through that we've
[1:45:55] got to fight through the human spirit
[1:45:57] amen to get to that inside
[1:46:01] man God bless you this morning pray
[1:46:04] something will said that encourage your
[1:46:06] heart we certainly love you we
[1:46:08] appreciate each and every one of you we
[1:46:10] appreciate the ministry here we

[1:46:17] I extend my love and appreciation for
[1:46:19] each and every one of you we kind of

[1:46:22] ice so so we're not going to be able to
[1:46:23] stay too long after service but we love
[1:46:25] you with all of our hearts and we're
[1:46:26] thankful for each and every one of you
[1:46:28] amen God bless you turn the service back
[1:46:29] to brother
[1:46:37] Bob amen see what can happen when
[1:46:40] somebody humbles them themselves and and
[1:46:42] lets the Lord do something I I believe
[1:46:44] this morning we heard from the Lord
[1:46:46] speaking to us if we can just take those
[1:46:49] words to heart and humble ourselves I
[1:46:51] thinking while the brother was speaking
[1:46:53] that um Jesus Come into that that place
[1:46:56] where the uh Pharisee invited him and
[1:46:59] humbled himself like the brother was
[1:47:01] saying and did that because like the
[1:47:04] brother was talking about that he knew
[1:47:07] somebody was going to Humble themselves
[1:47:08] and come to him I wonder is if maybe
[1:47:11] just start playing something softly
[1:47:14] maybe maybe this morning God's drawing
[1:47:19] you think about all those times in
[1:47:21] scripture where to come to God you got
[1:47:24] to humble yourself like naamon there
[1:47:26] that dip myself seven times in the water
[1:47:29] go down in the muddy Jordan and dip
[1:47:31] myself but he did what Elijah told him
[1:47:34] to and he was
[1:47:36] healed the little wiow of zerath that
[1:47:40] you mean to tell me I got to make a cake
[1:47:42] of bread first but she humbled
[1:47:46] herself maybe this morning God is I I
[1:47:50] believe he's calling all of us to Humble
[1:47:51] ourselves
[1:47:53] and maybe if you've been putting off
[1:47:56] just emptying yourself out maybe now is
[1:47:58] the
[1:48:00] time see maybe maybe you thought church
[1:48:02] was over this morning but I think it's
[1:48:04] just getting started our brother was our
[1:48:06] brother was saying if you really want to
[1:48:08] have church if you're living to worship
[1:48:10] then humble yourself can we do that this
[1:48:12] morning humble oursel humble oursel like
[1:48:15] that little woman that knelt at jesus'
[1:48:17] feet when everybody was laughing at him
[1:48:20] and making fun but she humbled herself
[1:48:23] and broke that Alabaster Box cuz she did
[1:48:27] she wanted to leave everything behind
[1:48:29] and come to
[1:48:31] Jesus maybe the Lord is drawing you this
[1:48:34] morning and we've heard the word
[1:48:36] preached now it's time to reap the
[1:48:39] benefits so if you need something from
[1:48:41] God won you come step out in the aisle
