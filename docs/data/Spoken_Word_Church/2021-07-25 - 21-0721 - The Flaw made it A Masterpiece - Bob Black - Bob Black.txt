just get right into the word did you come expecting tonight gotta take for a title tonight the the flaw made it a masterpiece and we'll we'll just read in isaiah 53 before we before we go right into the word let's just go to the author in prayer lord god we're so grateful to be able to gather together around your word and lord we pray lord that the word the songs that are sung and the words that are said lord will be for to edify your people and to help with god and lord we know that many people here tonight lord jesus in the middle of the week or maybe come in here needy and have different

help me lord god to speak your word i pray in the name of the lord jesus christ and isaiah 53 verses 1 to 9 says and just kind of keep in your mind the flaw is what made it a masterpiece it says who hath believed i report and to whom is the arm of the lord revealed for he shall he shall grow up before him as a tender plant and as a root out of a dry ground he hath no form nor comeliness and when we shall see him there's no beauty that we should desire he's despised and rejected a man a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief and we hid as it were our faces from him he was despised and we esteemed him not surely he hath borne our griefs and carried our sorrows yet we did esteem him stricken smitten of god and afflicted but he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we are healed all we like sheep have gone astray we have turned everyone to his own way and the lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all he was oppressed and he was afflicted yet he opened not his mouth he is brought as a lamb to the slaughter and as a sheep before her shearers is dumb so he openeth not his mouth he was taken from prison and from judgment and who shall declare his generation for he was cut off out of the land of the living for the transgression of my people was he stricken and he made his grave with the wicked and with the rich and his death because he had done no violence neither was any deceit in his mouth he may be seated the lord had his blessing to the word amen now now as we read that scripture you know of course that's obviously speak an old testament prophecy of of jesus christ and how he came and and all of the things that he suffered for us and you know reading about that you can surely see that there's there's a lot of flaws there it looks like a lot of flaws he was rejected and he was stricken and he was smitten and he was despised and there was no beauty that we should just desire him and that was it seems like a lot of things wrong with him and really you know think think think about that the flaw the flaw was what made it a masterpiece and you know brother branham when he preached the sermon the masterpiece and the identified masterpiece of god when he preached those sermons he was really taking his context from from he went to this little place out in california glendale out there where they've got um they got this little fancy cemetery and uh where he he walked with a lot of ministers that's out there where they make they do a lot of hollywood stuff a lot of disney and all that but they had this fancy cemetery that he was strolling through and out there they had a a replica of michelangelo's sculptures sitting there in the in the in the uh the cemetery and he looked at that sculpture and he began to kind of think upon things that he would speak as he as he talked about the masterpiece and he looked at it and it's got you know it has a big a big foundation out of the bottom and and it's you know real big you can look at it and but central central to the whole thing was the flaw that it had on the knee and he said as you as you really studied this message out he said the flaw ends up being what made the masterpiece the flaw is the is the it is the main point you see and and brother brandon said he said as he was as he was looking at that masterpiece that michelangelo had carved of moses and he said he said i like art real well i like art and he said i believe god is in art and i believe god is in music and i believe god is in nature and god is everywhere in other words that you can look at the things that you see you can look at the flowers and the trees and and the way that the sun comes up and know that that god is actually representing a story there that you plant a seed and it goes down in the ground and it dies and it rots and then it comes up and and when the sun goes down in the evening it comes up the next morning because it's showing over and over again that the resurrection that when something goes down you can look everywhere and see god typed in his in his creation god is everywhere in his creation and anything he said anything that's contrary to the original is a perversion anything that's conscious of the devil god is in art to show something genuine and to show something real but the devil wants to get in there and pervert pervert things to show something to a perversion of the real thing isn't that true that that everybody is really looking for something genuine you think about you know the young kids they're they're looking for somebody genuine the old people are looking for somebody genuine somebody that will actually represent a genuine gospel you know i kind of been meditating on that line for for a while you know there's a lot of things a lot of fakeness in the world but there is a genuine there's fake preachers there's false preachers and false prophets there's there's false truths but there's a real genuine truth and real genuine preachers a real genuine gospel that god is actually in and representing himself in brother ryan said god is in dancing not the kind of dancing you do here but when the sons and daughters of god are in the spirit of god see that's dancing see brother brown said that god we believe in dancing in the spirit we believe in getting in the spirit of god and and worshiping god and and and do it like like for example when david came over the the and saw all of his enemy destroyed all the egyptians by or not not david but miriam they began to dance and then david when he was follow following the ark of the covenant as it was restored back to his place he began to dance and everybody laughed at you see god god brother and saying god is in there god is in an actual worship a real thing in something genuine he's in something genuine and he began to look at that that statue that moses had spent his whole life or michelangelo had spent his whole life a carving of moses and you know really if you go back in history and begin to kind of just think on the cost that it cost michelangelo michelangelo started carving that statue and the pope that he was working for didn't want to pay him and he had to run back and forth and argue with the pope trying to get his money and spent years of his life laboring and he had that vision in his mind that he was trying to achieve and brother adam said the cult but this and the masterpiece that michelangelo had made it cost him something to do that it cost him something to make that image it wasn't just something that he could just haphazardly go out and just kind of throw out some supplies and here comes an image but it actually cost him something to do he had to spend years of his life laboring to get to the point where he could do it he had to spend years of his life laboring and wiping and and polishing and carving and doing spending time and arguing over the money and all those things it took a long time to get to the place where he could look at that image and say there it's finished he said he was a great man and it cost a big part of his life because he was many many years and carving out i don't know how many years but if you look at the timeline it's just about most of his life most of his life was spent labored and told to get that image to a place where he can look at it and say now it's complete and brother adam said you might walk up and say to him that looking at michelangelo carving away and he say what what are you pecking on that for to the outsider who doesn't know what's in his heart it's nonsense now isn't that what the the preaching of the gospel looks like a lot of times you come into a church and see see what looks like ministers pecking away in foolishness and preaching something that they've got a vision of that they're trying to make manifest the foolishness of the gospel that brother branham preached his heart out for years and years to see the vision of the almighty god made manifest and people will look at that and say what are you picking on that rock for it looks like just a bunch of foolishness like a bunch of nonsense noah they're making his ark it looks like a bunch of foolishness there building the ark a place where he could go hide and rest in moses it looks like a bunch of foolishness leading the mid the children of israel out were just just by yourself nobody else to help looks like a bunch of foolishness but god was in it he said but to the man the sculpture himself he's got a vision in his mind what he's trying to make he's trying to make a vision a vision that when he looks at it he can see he can see himself reflected in it bill abraham said he's trying to reproduce what he has on his mind in the form of a monument that's the reason he's digging it out of the rocks you know that's why we come to church is to allow the gospel to dig at our lives and dig out the things that are supposed to be there dig and mold us into a place where god can get us to and dig and cut and and hurt and many times we don't want to come and we don't want to allow the gospel to mold us and cut and cut on us but that's the thing that's actually molding us to a place where god can look at us and look at our lives and see his reflection in us and in that in amos chapter 3 verse 7 it says surely the lord god will do nothing but he revealeth his secret unto the servants the prophets in other words he's revealing his vision to the prophets that's why we needed a prophet that's why they needed prophets in the old testament because god has a vision in his mind of what he's trying to achieve and he can he can get that downloaded through the prophet the conduit of what he wants done and then that prophet can begin to share it with others like you think of moses the conduit of god's vision that he was able to share it with all the all the other artificers and all the builders of the tabernacle and say i want you to build it like this i want you to construct it like this he was sharing the vision of god so that people could build it he said for in first corinthians chapter 1 verse 18 for the preaching of the cross is to them that perish foolishness but unto us which are saved it is the answer the power of god why is that what is the preaching of the cross the preaching of the cross is the preaching of the vision the preaching of the vision that was communicated down from a prophet whether that was the son of man jesus christ preaching for three and a half years or the prophet in the end day who caught the vision of god what he wanted to be built the preaching of the cross is build actually building that monument actually hewing out what god thought in his mind before the foundation of the world but brother brown said to do this to do this you have to start off right at the beginning and you have to follow the pattern you've got to stick with the pattern if you don't stick with the pattern then the building will not be built right it'll go off in some kind of denominational idea it'll get healed off in something that dies and falls apart it'll maybe build on sinking sand that they can't stand the test of time but if you follow the pattern it'll end up looking just like the vision that god saw in the back part of his mind you've got to follow the pattern he said see you can't get a little piece to start off we'll make it this way no i believe he said no he's got to have an exact pattern we're not building a pattern based on man's ideas or what we think it ought to look like or the idea that like denominations they run off with their own little ideas and go off into a little area and say now we've got it and they cabbage down and put a period on it on the end of it what we're building according to the pattern that god saw before the foundation of the world now moses when he went up into the mountain god gave him a pattern to build the tabernacle and he came back down because he was a prophet and the bible says the bible says in exodus it says look that thou make them after that pattern which would show thee in the mouth so he went up into the mountain and he got a pattern and he came down and began to share that pattern with others so that the construction should begin in hebrews chapter eight verse 5 it says who serve unto the example and shadow of heavenly things as moses was admonished of god when he was about to make the tabernacle foresee saith he that thou make all things according to the pattern showed to thee and the mount in other words moses went up into the mount and would showed a heavenly pattern that he could then reproduce in earth he was reproducing in earth what he saw a heavenly pattern for and this pattern is what was what was communicated to down through the prophets the pattern the pattern shows that there's a progression you start off maybe simply and you move on up like building building a monument you start off with a foundation and you move on up through the from the foundation to the body to the head and you wind up with a head and there you can stand back and you can see now i see i see what was in the vision of the of the sculptor's mind but you've gotta you've got to build according to the pattern and he said the pattern has got to come by inspiration he said now a genuine sculptor is inspired like a genuine poet or any genuine singer musician whatever might be so it's got to be inspired now now you know when you read the bible and it's not inspired you can read it and it'll actually end up maybe killing yourself you'll think well well i've got to save myself by doing things or i've got to save myself you can get all skewed up and it'll actually begin killing but if you read by inspiration the actual essence of what it's trying to communicate will pop off the page and you'll get what it's really trying to say many times we'll read the bible the wrong way and it's like like like beating ourselves with a hammer but if you read it the right way then you'll actually see the grace that's laying there for you he said michelangelo must have had the inspiration of what moses really looked like and he called it in his mind what moses must have been now if michelangelo the sculptor could catch the inspiration of what moses really looked like and then make make the image to look like what his inspiration showed then what what if we can catch the inspiration of what god wants us to be in that day and then match up match up with what god thought of us before the foundation of the world now brother burnham said he said brethren you never you see everything that we do has got to be by inspiration he said you never preached a sermon in your life the holy spirit preached through you a sermon that's right see we don't preach the holy spirit does the preaching oh me we might write out something and read it but that isn't preaching preaching is when inspiration comes and it's preached by inspiration and the holy spirit gives the unction do you remember when brother brandon preached what is the holy ghost given for that's one of the things that he laid out that is to give an unction an unction to preach an unction to speak an action to live it's the holy ghost that's powering us that's moving us that's actually inspiring us to match the gospel he said now we can read something and it just doesn't matter but when the holy spirit gets a hold of it and takes it out to the people then something takes a hold see and that's this holy spirit he said i may not be able to put it together right i only speak by inspiration and inspiration is just when you find it here you grab it and hand it out just when you find it inspiration coming and he's grabbing it and handing it out grabbing it and handing it out as inspiration comes and where is the inspiration coming from it's coming from the fountain of everlasting life it's coming from something down on the inside that's pulsing out something that you can give out listen when you give it out it'll give somebody freedom and liberty to lose somebody from their bonds because it's not coming from some man-made idea it's not coming from a broken cistern but it's coming from something genuine he said you reach and get it and hand it out it may be an old-fashioned sacrifice right way but it'll do you good if you'll keep it is that it'll stick to your ribs and hold you he said it save me and it'll save you now job 32 verse 8 says but there is a spirit in man and the inspiration of he's talking about job's talking about how that you think that a man that living a long time would have a lot of wisdom you think that somebody living for a long time would have would be able to know what they're talking about but he said but there's a spirit in man and the inspiration of the almighty giveth him understanding many times people that live a long time may not just by their intellectual knowledge may lack things that the spirit can teach you if you get in the spirit and stay in the spirit and get that inspiration that the spirit will bring that will bring true understanding in john 14 26 but the comforter which is the holy ghost whom the father will send in my name says he shall teach you all things and bring all things to your remembrance whatsoever i have said unto you in other words inspiration inspiration of the spirit and that's what we need is revelation of the word the revelation of the word is the most important thing in our lives the revelation is more important than anything else because it's the true inspiration of what is laying there in the letter of the page and brother brown said just think that vision on his mind for so many years to make it look just exactly to what it was he caught the vision first and how he had to work to that vision cutting off and making down and when he got to where he perfected it till it really got perfect he stood and looked at it when he finished up that morning with a hammer in his hand now you think of michael michelangelo stepping back from his masterpiece that he had worked and told that for all those years under inspiration with a vision of what he wanted to see and after all those years he stepped back with a hammer in his hand and he had a hammer and he said he was so inspired when he looked at it because the vision of his mind was standing before him in reality and then when it was completed he stood back with a hammer or sculptor's hammer in his hand and he looked at that monument and the inspiration of the vision that he had seen of how to do it inspired him so much till he the inspiration struck him till he got beside himself and struck it across the knee and said speak the inspiration that there what he had labored at for all those years was now in front of him and with inspiration he took that hammer and struck it and said speak and he said now now there's a flaw now there's a flaw on that great image on the knee on the right knee just above the knee about six inches is a place he said i put my hand on it about that deep and there's a broken place on the knee of moses there's a flaw and he said it made a flaw in it to me the flaw was met what made it the masterpiece the flaw was the thing that made it the masterpiece now look now look the way brother branham explains this as you run it through this sermon he kind of takes the flaw in different directions but now now let's take it in this direction now i want you to maybe examine your life as you look to your own life and you look back to your past and the things that you've done in your past that you listen i was talking to one of the young people one time and they were i wish that the things i had done in my past that i i'd never done and i wish that i could leave those things behind but you see god's put god's allowed things to go on in your life so so that so that to bring you to a place look he's allow he's used actually using your flaws so that you don't rely on yourself you begin to turn your trust and turn your faith to the one that can take your flaws and make a masterpiece out of you [Applause] now listen paul and in second corinthians you know paul had a flaw he had something that he labored with all his life and and he asked god over and over again he's will you please take this thing from me so that i can serve you but somehow god allow that flaw to remain and paul said so that i would not become exalted within my revelation in other words because god wanted me to put all my trust all of my efforts in him and to rely completely on him to lean on him for everything that i have need of now paul said for this thing i besought the lord thrice that it might depart from me and he said unto me by grace is sufficient for thee for my for my strength is made perfect in weakness think about that his strength my strength is made perfect in weakness that god actually wants you to be weak he wants you not to rely on your own abilities not to rely on your own self not to rely on anything that you can do but put all of your trust in him he's the one that's going to accomplish it he said most gladly therefore will i rather glory in my infirmities that the power of christ may rest upon me in other words make la i glory that that i'm not trusting in my own abilities it's not by my own self now now thinking about this now brother branham had a flaw his own self he had something that every seven years he would deal with a stomach ailment to the point where the doctor would look at his stomach and say your stomach the lining of your stomach is all hardened up and brother i'm gonna go to him and god deliver me of this and every seven years he would come back and he had it he had this ailment that he had to deal with over and over and then on the wings of a snow white dove one month before he passed away a month before he passed away in other words his whole life god let him deal with his flaw in his body and he said somehow i know i'll tell you before it happens the doctor is a good dog no doubt i think he's a fine man but i know i'm going to be over it it's done it's finished and i'm going to be well and we know the story i'm not going to lay it all out all the all the visions the dreams that he saw the the the squirrel thing that he crushed under his foot and all of those things but listen he he had a flaw that god was actually to put to put him to put that man into a place where he would not rely on himself you see you see if you can look back at your life and just let all the flaws all the problems in your life and say yes i've got flaws i've got problems but yet god is molding me into what he wants me to be amen why do we why do we have fault why are flaws permitted because listen one of the great secrets mysteries of the message is actually that the way up is down we think so many times and if i could just press myself into a great position in the church if i could just press myself into being an important person if i could press myself into being an important preacher in the message then then i'd really be something but the way up is actually down the way up is to go down to the dust down so far brother brown said that if you rise above the dust you've risen above god if we can get ourselves to a place that we're so far so far down in humility that god can actually do something with us something will take place listen in matthew 23 all these parables that jesus laid out for us about exalting yourself over and over he said call no man your father upon the earth father for one is your father which is in heaven neither be called masters for one is your master even christ but he that is greatest among you shall be your servant and whosoever shall exalt himself shall be abased and he that shall humble himself shall be exalted so if you put yourself up then sooner or later god's going to have to get a hold of you and knock you down a pig the way up is down and the way down is up in luke chapter 18 he says i fast twice in the week get telling this parable of of the of the public and praying and he said i press twice in the week i give tithes of all that i possess and the republicans standing afar off two two standing there praying and the republicans said the publican will not lift up so much as his eyes under heaven but smote upon his breath saying god be merciful to me a sinner god be merciful to me in other words this man was not standing there pointing fingers at other people and judging one another and saying i'm better than the other i'm better than the other church we're better than the other church we're better than the other people somehow within my own self something that i'm doing without my own self makes me better but he had humbled himself and he said i tell you this man went down to his house justified rather than the other for everyone that exalteth himself shall be abased and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted and luke chapter 14 10 to 11 but when they are bidden when somebody calls you to the feast go and sit down in the lowest room and then maybe they'll tell you to come up higher for whosoever exalteth himself shall be abased and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted why because we're not depending on our own abilities listen this is a great truth lay it in here in this in this message that it's not by your own works it's not by your own power that you're going to overcome but it's by his spirit now now brother brown set his toils laboring to see the vision become manifested he said his toils and wearies and long nights and housed away from the world for days and maybe eat a sandwich and rub on it and get back and no that's just not the way it was now it's got to come down to this and rubbing it and rubbing it some more done the old testament in the old testament talks about the prophets rising up early and working all day and just laboring constantly the prophets giving their lives for the people so that they could catch the vision that was actually god in them doing something god laboring to see his vision molded and made he said then when he saw it just perfect then he saw in reality the negative of the what was in his mind had become real it became positive therefore it sprung into him and it was so real that he must cry out speak to me it was a reflection it was a compliment to his work that his own work so inspired him that he would become it beside himself now think think of the almighty god st we're talking about michelangelo but think about god becoming so beside himself to see the image coming to the place coming the tabernacle coming to a place where he can look at it and say that looks exactly the way that i had it in my mind to smite it and to say speak that he would become beside himself to smite it and to say speak now brother brahm said i really like this part of this message he said now let us turn the page of michelangelo it's like reading out of a book of michelangelo he's got a book that he's reading from let's turn the page of michelangelo and close the book close that book and let's open another book and read of the great sculptor the almighty now this other book you see i i believe maybe we could put our own lives in that place up now now we'll close close the book of of our faults and our failures and close the book of all the places that we messed up and let's open this other book the other what book is it i believe it's that book that brother branham was referring to in the first in the first seal in paragraph 33 where he began to talk about a book that was open a book that you can look into and see yourself identified with it and then in paragraph 33 he compares that book with the bible who for years it was sealed up and nobody could read in a rev chapter rev the book of revelation and nobody could understand what the seven churches are but then you be it now it's opened up so that you can read the end to now we got a book that we can oh it's laying there opened up before us and we can look into it and read he said read of the great sculpt of the almighty and he said who before there was a world and before the foundations was laid he had in his mind what he wanted how now what what did he want he wanted you he wanted you to be part of this image he wanted you to be part of it and he wanted to make man in his own image he wanted to make something in reality of what was a vision to him what was in his thinking i said now to michelangelo that was an attribute of his thought to michelangelo that was an attribute of his thought but to god that was an attribute of his thought that he wanted to express and he said he wasn't like a man now a sculptor that has to take something that's been created to hew an image he was the sculptor of eternal things he was a sculptor that could create and bring into existence that which he has in his mind to do or otherwise he can make material what his attributes desired so in other words he's not sculpting with a chisel and stone but he's actually bringing forth by his word he's actually speaking something into existence and you see if that's how he did it then and he's hebrews 13 8 then that's how he's still operating today he's still working by the same pattern he's still moving the same way he worked according to this pattern by bringing up something from something simple and big from a foundation and working it up until there was standing in front of them the completed object and brother branham said and as he began to work upon creeping did you know that we actually believe in evolution not the evolution that's just haphazard where just some things happen that maybe god turned his back on it and and just allowed just things to just happen but we we believe in an evolution where god was actively involved progressing things from this point to this point to this point and brother brown said he began to work upon creeping things like upon the little animals upon the earth and then he began to bring it from that into something else higher then finally he brought it into the larger animal such as the lion tiger bear then he brought it into the life of maybe of monkeys and apes and so forth god working in a pattern he's working in a pattern that he's still working in today working from a foundation up up higher and higher moving higher until finally he said finally there came forth upon the earth a perfection and that was a man and then he could see in that man that it looked like him so now when he looked upon him he was a reflection of what his creator was god had now been able to achieve the thing that he wanted a man in his own image what's this masterpiece that we're talking about what's what's what are we talking about a man a man that matches what god thought of in his own mind a man that he could put himself in a man in god's own image and he said there was something about him yet that didn't look just right because that he was by himself so he struck a little blow over on his left side and there's that flaw again the flaw is what makes the masterpiece the flaw i wonder just maybe to dramatize a little bit i wonder ever since ever ever after that that god put adam to sleep if maybe he could look down and and maybe touch a place in his side and remember you know god left that flaw in jesus's side he could always thomas was able to put his hand in his side and touch that place where the spear went in and he was able to feel the flaw in his hands and touch that place where he had been nailed to the cross and maybe maybe you think about adam looking down and remembering my my my my help meat actually came out of me and god she's actually part of me she's actually bone of my bone and flesh of my spirit flesh we're actually one and he said from there he took the peace that struck off of it and made him a helpmate a wife then he wasn't by himself he struck a piece off of him struck a piece off of adam and there they too were one and there you got the true masterpiece a man and his wife there together in harmony a masterpiece family walking in the garden of eden together in oneness that you see what god is trying to bring us through us to a place where we're not at odds with our maker at odds with the vision that god saw before the foundation of the world but he's bringing us to a place where we can walk in harmony where two are not two but one two were brought together in oneness and harmony now see he said now first he had a masterpiece of himself but now he's seen that the masterpiece was lonesome like he was so he divided the masterpiece by striking it in the side and brought forth a help meet and now to make the 2-1 to make the 2-1 he put them like any great sculptor and a place that's beautiful he put them right there in the garden of eden now if you think about the garden of eden think about think about all the places in the bible that talk about going up into aham and moses went up into a mountain and and the amount of transfiguration and brother branham going up into a mountain and think about eden eden was obviously a high place because out of eden flowed a river that split off into four rivers that watered all of eden it watered at the garden of eden so it's got to be up in a high place so eating eden was the garden of eden was situated up and brother brown begins to explain now that when you've got something that you want to show when you've got when you've got a light you don't put a bushel over it you actually put it out there on display and so that's actually what god was doing with his masterpiece he took that masterpiece that he had made by his word and actually put it on display in a high place in the garden of eden so that all could benefit from that do you realize that's what he's doing with you with his little masterpieces he's actually putting you on display in your workplace and in your church and everywhere you go he's got you in this play because you you're the light of the world you're you're shining out the gospel so that others can see in matthew chapter 5 it says a city that is set on a hill cannot be hid neither do men light a candle and put it under a bushel but on a candlestick and it giveth light unto all that are in the house let your light show shine before men that they may see your good works and glorify your father which is in heaven he said he placed his masterpiece the two being one in the garden of eden the masterpiece is the stroke that marred san angelo's moses masterpiece and the monument and it was the stroke that cut the side of his masterpiece that brought out the bride and now we see them as a masterpiece family in the garden of eden how beautiful it was and it so pleased him until he took rest then he said i'll rest now now now you see there's a picture there the picture there is that the masterpiece is there in the garden of eden and they're walled up around by the word and they they're so fortified by the word because every day in the cool of the evening and on and on god is actually coming and fellowshipping with him and sharing with him his thoughts and sharing with him his vision and they're catching the revelation and they're able to adam's able to speak to the mountains and speak to the lakes and move things and move things out of the way why because they're so fortified behind the word they've got the revelation of the hour they know what god wants done with the word and they're standing there fortified do you realize if you've got the word you've got the answer to everything that the devil can throw against you everything that the devil can come again come at you with unless there's a question that's why we've got to get all the questions answered we got to nail the questions down because if there's a question about anything the devil can squeeze in and slide in and say well uh are you sure are you sure you're gonna die are you sure you're gonna die but if you're fortified by the word you you won't be like eve but you can say god told me that if i eat of something that i'm not supposed to eat of that i pray if i partake of a lie that i'm gonna die god told me that if you stay fortified by the word behind the staying fortified behind the word means when the devil comes and tells you something that's contrary to the word you're so fortified that you just throw the word back at him that's how you defeat the enemy by staying fortified behind the word the word is like a wall it's like a shield that you hold up and a sword and a helmet and a breastplate and the and the and all the all the armor that paul talked about because you can actually use it to ward off the devil amen brother ram said now notice this one thing i want you to bear in mind that god gave this man a protection he gave him he fortified him inside of his word because he told them what they could do what they could not do and that's the same basis we're set on today what we can do what we cannot do that's a stumbling quote in there the same basis he said no matter no matter how good we are how much we go to church or do this we got to be born again you got to be born again what what do i need to do you got to be born again you say it doesn't matter what i do you got to be born again you've got to be born again and see then that'll begin to settle everything because then then you've got the believer on the inside that can actually know the correct interpretation of the word and then you can believe it the right way and become fortified so that when the devil starts throwing his darts at you you've got an answer for him if you've got an answer for the devil then then when he comes and says i don't believe that the holy ghost is for you i don't believe that the blessing is for you i don't believe that you can get healed then you've got something to throw back in his face you've got something to give back at him and tell him to go away because nothing else is going to scare the devil but the word will the word will resist the devil every time the word is how you defeat the devil you know jesus told us how to defeat the devil by demonstrating with his own life he said it is written and is written and in his weakest condition after he came out of the wilderness fasting for what 50 days or hour low 40 days 40 days of fasting and he came out in his weakest condition he demonstrated when he could have called a legion of angels but he demonstrated how you and your weakest conditions can defeat the devil every time by staying fortified behind the word stay fortified behind the word and brother brown said and then the enemy come in by deceit and crawled through the walls got through the walls of god's word because the door was open to him why was the door open to him because there was a like a little question a little doubt a little gap in eve's mind that well maybe maybe he's got a good point do you see the purpose of coming to church and reading the message and reading your bible and so that you become so fortified behind the word that no matter what what false prophet or false teacher or anybody comes and throws something in your lap you stay fortified behind the word and said i know i know that the promises of god are for me i know that the benefits are for me i know that there's a promise laying in there in the scripture for me listen when the devil comes and tells you that you're going to get sick or that there's no that you're just going to have to stay that way you could throw back in his face that he was wounded for my transgressions you could throw back in his face that my strength is made perfect in weakness you can throw back in his face that the promises to as many as are called you could throw back in his face that hebrews 13 8 he's the same yesterday today and forever why because you're fortified behind the word and you know what god wants done with it now brother ram said and the conflict between god and satan he said after you become a christian then you are fortified by the word and any promise in the word he said didn't know i was going to say that you are when you become a christian you're placed behind the word of god see now there's your fortress your fortress safety your fortress not not a feeling or a sensation but staying fortified behind the word every promise in that is yours only thing you have to do is just reach and get it and go right on with it how you know what's going to work i don't know i was going to work explain to me i don't know only thing i know that god gave his children the best attack that they could have and the best thing to attack with because he knows the working of the enemy the working of the enemy is to slip through into your reason and get you to start reasoning about something that's going on get you to start thinking about thinking too heavy about something it's thinking about your own the all your own way of thinking instead of taking it back to the scripture and reason the reason according to the bible there ain't nothing wrong with reasoning as long as it's reasoning according to the bible brother brahman said in putting on the whole armor of god he said we're in a wrestling match we're wrestling not with fine intellectual psychology but we're wrestling with the power and the promise of god which can break any hold on any devil at any time now how is how is god going to break the whole of a devil he's going to do it by his word because his word will fortify you now now let's examine this for a little bit he said jesus our lord proved it when he was immanuel god himself made flesh among us and when he met satan to show that satan could be defeated by the word every time satan would come to him he said it's written it's written oh how i would like to take him here on some note i got right here on the things that he said how many times that he broke satan's power with us written how many times he broke satan's power with this written now if he broke satan's power with this written you can break his power with us written too it's oh my showing that that fortified person behind the word of god can scream out it's written turn him loose turn loose satan for it is written if you're staying behind the word if you abide in me and my words and you ask what you will that's right can't be wrong that's got to be right now now you see you see that's what the gospel was said the word actually looses you from the power of the devil now how does that do it how does it do it let's let's give an example i was listening to an evangelist testify about how he was in a service and he began to preach combating that idea that's so prevalent in the message that that if you are a bastard that you cannot be saved and he began to preach and he began to lay out all of these scriptures and you see what it was was that it was actually he began to fortify the young people in the congregation with the word so that they began to realize that the blood of jesus christ was more powerful than anything that the devil could do it's more powerful than anything that their mama and daddy could do it's more powerful than anything of this earth the blood of jesus christ is powerful enough to blot off every spot every wrinkle and he began to by the preaching of the gospel began to loose loose them from the bind that satan that got them in do you realize my wife and i were talking about this the other day she was sharing something that she heard in a message that the devil the devil actually the way he works is he binds you first and then he starts taking see he binds you he makes you think he'll get you in a place where you are you're drinking alcohol and then he starts taking your life from you he binds you to a place to real make you think that because of something that your mama and daddy did that there ain't no grace for you anymore and then he begins to take he starts taking your joy and taking your taking your hope and it begins to take everything but the power of the gospel is to preach it the right way so that all the stuff that the devil is binding begins to it actually begins to loose you from whatever the devil's bound you with whatever whether it's depression whether it's anxiety whether it's fear it's actually the word of god has given you hope giving you faith unleashing something within your life that god wants you to see [Applause] that's why the message that's what the gospel says in matthew 18 18 verily i say unto you whatsoever ye shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven and whatsoever ye shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven listen the gospel is actually looser it's the looser of them that are bound and it actually binds up the devil so he can't do any work anymore satan wants to bind the church and god wants to loose him so that they can actually worship him and praise him and servant and live for him the way that he wants them to listen people will say you the devil will say you can't be saved or god hates you or god is punishing you or you'll never take a rapture or you'll never be delivered or i i was listening to another brother he began to share how uh uh a a i'll say a false prophet i'm gonna say it like this began to tell him one day in a message he began to say i say unto thee i say unto thee and laid on him all these accusations have you got all these personality complexes and he went home and began to think oh god do i do i really have all this pride or whatever it was that that man was laying on top of you see what the devil wants to do is bind you and he began to he began to worry and he was bound up for like two weeks you see how just just a little flippant word so somebody can bind them up but then he said one day one day he came across the path of of a gospel minister that said all that man that everything he says is everything he said don't come to pass and it loosed him because he was telling him the truth the genuine truth will actually loose you from something that the devil wants to bind you with amen now brother roman said in the second seal the natural first bride of the human race before her husband come to her she fell from grace by listening to satan's lie after god had for fortified behind his word and she had stayed behind the word she had never failed now that's in the natural notice the natural woman and what was the curse the actual curse of coming out from behind god's word was death and so god started over he started over with he began his work all over again i know y'all are looking at the clock thinking this sermon is going to take a while now hang on start it over i thought i thought you were closing brother and brother braham said see the love of god after man had fallen and deliberately opened the door to the enemy after man had fallen and opened up the door so that they listened to the devil's lie and come in and marred him and set death in him and still god was not willing to be defeated still god was not willing to be defeated he came down and started all over again he was going to make that man again he said god went to work immediately to build it up again he wasn't willing that it should perish lay there like that all the time because he is god and he will not be defeated so he went to work immediately and began to build again unto his own image a man now listen to this first thing he starts off he starts off in the garden he said do don't do this do this but now he starts off with an unconditional covenant i'm going to do it now now you see you see grace really entering the picture here now he said now we find that the andalusian world come along and destroy the whole thing because the covenants that was made was made conditionally if you will not do this or if you will do that god the great sculptor seen that man could not keep a covenant could not keep a covenant so in other words you by the law you can't keep the law by your own work it's not by your own power that you run this race you can't do it you need something within you to do the keeping for you he said he just can't do it there is just no way at all and he said in abraham he started him on an unconditional covenant an unconditional covenant that god's going to make a way he's going to he just said i'm going to do it he said not not if you will i have i've already done it i've blessed you and your seed and so forth after you it was an unconditional covenant he started with abraham his workmanship again and now with his unconditional covenant then when we find out he based on abraham abraham and give him the covenant unconditional covenant unconditional with the promise now that's a lot that's really hard for a lot of us to grasp right before this sermon right before brother brown preached the masterpiece he had one of the only one one of the very few i don't know if there's any other personal private interviews that he had that he recorded right before this sermon and he recorded this this private interview interview with a little sister bruce and see sister bruce was wondering i believe i put it like this wondering about this how how is it by the things that i do or is god actually doing a work in me and it's not based upon my own power my own locomotion the on she began to look at her own faults now listen to listen to the way she words this we're talking about grace now he said but brother brandon i have so many things this is sister bruce talking about i have so many things that i know that's wrong now now how many of us sitting here today can say that i've got so many things that i know that's wrong so many flaws we'll say it like that so many flaws that we look at so many things that we can remember and and look at now even in our day-to-day life so many things that we did this morning he said i said but look sister you don't look at yourself it's just what your desire is and what you try to do see because when you get the new birth he's changing your heart down on the inside now where you once wanted to do wrong or you didn't care now on the inside it grieves you when when you make a mistake it grieves you when you hurt somebody's feelings it grieves you when you when you when you say the wrong thing or somebody or you or you don't you you misinterpret the word and find out later that that things need to be corrected he said listen look sister you don't look at yourself it's just what your desire is and what you try to do and if you really love the lord you try to serve him with all your heart and then all your mistakes is hid in the blood of the lord jesus now think about think how powerful that is all your mistakes all your flaws all your problems all your past are hid under the blood of the lord jesus now now you can't really read the personal interview and get the full effect of it you got to go listen to it and i'll tell you why it's not that long but if you'll go listen to it as she's saying i i feel i look so much at all the things that i'm doing you can hear the congregation out there before brother branham comes out to preach the masterpiece you can hear the congregation begin to sing louder and louder there is power in the blood there's power in the blood and they begin to sing that why why things don't happen just by circumstance she's wondering if it's by her own works and her own power and this congregation out that outside of singing there's power in the blood the blood is what covers you over and covers over all your faults and covers over all your failures i'm so glad tonight that we've got a covering that god's not looking at our faults and our failures he's not looking at my past but it's been covered over his sister bruce said i've made so many i make so many mistakes and i failed so many times he said that's why christ had to die so that you with your mistakes wouldn't be lauded to you wouldn't be lauded to you they're not allotted to you if they're under the blood they're covered over we got a covering this afternoon he said he took your mistakes your desire and your heart is to serve him sister bruce says yes all right that's what he died for so you could serve him see not your mistakes are not looked not allotted to you he is your propitiation he is your sin offering your sins are not known you're not a sinner before god christ took your sins and became you because your desire is to serve you listen that ought to lose to everybody from the bonds that the devil's got on you to know that he's not looking at your sin you know in the old testament they would take they would take that burn that sacrifice and they would burn it up and get take the ashes and pour it out on the fire throughout the camp and the smoke would go up over the congregation who assembled that god was not looking at their faults and failures but he was looking through the shed blood he was looking through the sacrifice and that's how he's looking at us tonight he's not he's not looking at your problems but he's looking through what he did for you to pay the price and cover over your problems you know so many times when we stumble and fall we start we start looking to one another for justification we start looking to one another to see did somebody else do the same thing i did did somebody else make the same slip with the same stumble that i did but you know if we'd stop doing that and look up and look up to what god is covered with that we've got a covering rahab at a covering with her and her prostitution and all of her troubles sitting there on the wall she hung that scarlet thread out there and it was a covering that when all the wall fell that little part of the wall that she was on did not and ruth ruth with her horrible lineage that she could look back on and all that stuff how the the how the tribe of moab started with all that incestuous relationship with with lot and all of his daughters and all that stuff she had a lot of baggage that she could look back on a lot of scars maybe that she could look back on but there her uh naomi told her to go out into the threshing floor and lay down at boaz's feet and he covered her over he gave her a covering and said you've been covered over by the holy ghost and god's not looking at you anymore cause you're covered over you see so many times we get to where we're looking at one another like brother branham did when he was sitting there in that restaurant and he began to look over and look over at that lady sitting there with all of her makeup on and look at her horrible what looked like a horrible condition and he began to judge her within his heart and he began to say he said he said i looked and i thought oh my ah he said i stood there said god you and your holiness how could you ever stand to look at that when it kills me to look at it my to think that a prophet of god was and nobody could point at him and say well you never did this or you never drunk alcohol you never nobody could you ever did anything nobody his life his life was correct and he was standing there judging standing there looking at that woman with scorn and the angel came by and said step over behind the door i want to teach you a lesson something said to me get behind the door and he said i went back behind the door and stood there he's talking about a covering now we got a covering we got a covering like ruth had a covering we got a covering like all these people in the bible had a covering on top our covering is the holy ghost a covering is the blood that christ shed for us on the cross and he said i i went back behind the door and stood there i waited a little bit of vision come i saw a world turning and around the world was a mist that looked like blood springing around and i looked in there and there i was doing things wrong there i was doing things wrong he called his remembrance my if we could just call our own if we could just realize that we're we're guilty of things every day he said every time i do something wrong my sins would start before god and god would slay me for it but jesus was standing there like a bumper he caught it i see the tears run down his cheeks and i'd do something else bad his blood would hold it keep it from touching me from killing me god would kill me the day you eat thereof the day you die the penalty of letting the devil slip in behind the fortification of god's word is death the day you eat the day you die but yet god's got a covering for us and he said i looked at it and then the vision i went up to him i said lord i'm ashamed of myself they're laying my book laying there they're laying my book with all kinds of evil wrote on it i said will you plea will you forgive me lord that i put you in that condition he reached back tapped his hand like this and rode across the book with his own blood pardoned throwed it over behind him then he did he opened up a new book he opened up a new book you see what will we do without grace we've all fallen short of the of the glory of god we've all there's none good no not one every one of us needs grace every one of us needs the grace of god what would we do without grace and we have no room to point fingers at others now listen i'm getting into something here hang on with me just a few minutes he said in john in john chapter 8 is the parable that jesus tells of the woman coming up the woman that had been caught actually in the act of adultery and the people drug her up before him screaming for her death or calling out for her death and so jesus so when they continued asking me he lifted up himself and said unto unto them he that is without sin among you let him first cast a stone at her let him first cast the stone who's without sin you see because we've all fallen short amen and they which heard it being convicted by their own conscience went out one by one beginning at the eldest even unto the last you see you see god has given us a grace in this hour by the opening of the word to actually overcome the accuser they came with their accusations came with all of their false charges and things came screaming for death screaming i'm going to share something with you now i remember probably 20 years ago somebody came to me with some accusations of somebody that they could not prove and i began to discuss with them what do you want to happen to this person they were they were very upset with this person ready to ready to ready to do you know so i said i said what what do you want to happen to this person and they said i want their life to be ruined i want everything that they stand for to be destroyed and i'm maybe summarizing you see you see when that when an accuser is is a is seeking death it just shows that something's wrong when an accuser is sinking seeking something like that it shows it and that's what the devil the devil is seeking our death the devil is trying to get us to a place where you see in revelation chapter 12 it said for the accuser of our brethren is cast down which accused him before our god day and night and they overcame him by the blood of the lamb and by the word of their testimony and they loved not their lives unto the death how did they overcome how do they overcome the accuser by the blood of the lamb by the covering that god gave to them by the word by the word of their testimony by speaking back what had been given to them by saying the promises that had been shared with them see my defense my defense is the word we're all guilty but he is our righteousness he is our covering he is our all now when the devil says you're guilty when the devil says you've done something he's our covering that we can look to that we can we that our representation that he's he's our lawyer and our judge and our advocate that we can look to to to realize that we're not guilty he said every time every time he would start a masterpiece satan would get it because the word but when he started with abraham he said i've already done it now this is unconditionally not that if you will i will but i've already done it i've already done it and so he began to work on the foundation now now see the foundation i'm i'm gonna wind up in just a few minutes don't get word here the foundation the foundation is a foundation with flaws he said now watch every masterpiece is put on a foundation a sculpture angelo's monument of moses is on a three or four foot piece of marble it's got a foundation so god and preparing this masterpiece he put he put it on the foundation of the patriarchs now you see this whole message is about grace it's about people with flaws that god has taken their flaws and making masterpieces out of them so this foundation is a foundation full of flaws so he's taking it but the devil likes to point at our flaws and say and accuse us of our flaws but but we've got a covering for those flaws see now abraham was the foundation of faith brother brahma said he said let's say it had four foundations but think about all of abraham's flaws he had a past full of idolatry he lied about who his wife was twice he went down into egypt due to phantom famine out of the promised land he he did all that he had a lot of counts against him but yet he god placed him as the foundation of this masterpiece the foundation of love was isaac the foundation of grace was jacob god's grace to jacob anyone knows that now isaac lied and said rebecca was his sister so isaac's got that flaw there he's got a flaw but yet god takes him and molds him into a masterpiece the foundation of grace was jacob jacob the little mama's boy jacob the the waste until his brother is all exhausted and famished to ask for the birthright it looks like everything he's doing is contrary to any anything that anybody would would teach you in just like a school of how to behave and how to act right deceives his blind and bedridden father and he and he's got all these flaws keeped up on him but and joseph was perfection there's where he could set the monument upon not the first foundation the second foundation the third foundation but on the fourth foundation and it looks like you could say joseph was perfect but joseph's got a flaw joseph's got a scratch he said to joseph there's nothing against him just one little scratch for the foundation must also be a masterpiece when he told his father the prophet say to pharaoh that your people are cattle raisers and not shepherds because a shepherd is an abomination to the egyptian so it scratched it see that's why it still makes it the masterpiece it's the masterpiece because the flaw is what makes it the masterpiece because he's making something that not by your own power or on by your own works but he's taking a flawed individual and making a masterpiece out of them and it keeps on coming down he said he was the fulfilling of all the prophets he was so perfect until god seeing this he smote him and his cried out speak as michelangelo did speak the perfect image the god man god and morphy had changed from supernatural to the vision and the vision was projected into the image and the image was smitten so that the supernatural could taste the feeling of death god's perfect masterpiece and now in order for this to speak he is the word and for the word to speak he must come into the image and then for the image to speak it's got to be smitten he comes into the image and then in order to speak the perfect redeemer he's got to be smitten so that out from his side can come forth a piece smitten to get a bride and brother ram talks about how he went to the diamond mine and he asked the man why why does that why does these uncut diamond why do they not sparkle and the man told him well they got to be cut it's got to be cut and sliced up to be to sparkle and and and see brother brown explain that you take a diamond and you slice that little cut off of it and then you could take that that little piece that looks like something that you would just discard and you make a make a vitrola needle out of it you could take that and make a record put on the needle of a record player and then it can catch the voice it can catch by inspiration he said the needle is what brings it out brings out the true interpretation of the word see the flaw is actually what makes the masterpiece and it makes the master the the the masterpiece submitting it yields a another piece that matches the original matching pieces he fulfilled the old testament now it's the new testament another another piece to boot fulfilled see the new and old as husband and wife and it taken the new the old to foreshadow the new christ come the masterpiece to fulfill that now his bride will fulfill everything that's in the new testament now i'm gonna i'm just gonna wind up right on there because brother the musicians can go ahead i'm gonna see the bride because god is building up his masterpiece again in this day brother he said the sculptor now had the word reflected in the masterpiece again called his son god emmanuel just think that a person so yielded until god identified himself in there in that body and he became him him and god became one i and my father are one my father dwelleth in me i do that always which pleases the father he said what if the christian today could have a testimony like that you would be a masterpiece right here and i'll say right here in lula georgia you would be a masterpiece i want could we can we sing there's power in the blood let's let's do i i wonder if we got any like sister bruces here in the congregation this morning that are wondering if they're going to be able to overcome by their own works and maybe we could just look up to our covering this afternoon let's let's stand to our feet and just worship him and sing that god taking flaws flawed people flawed individuals with weaknesses and making a masterpiece out of them [Music] would you be free from the burden of sin there's power in the blood [Music] [Applause] in the blood [Music] would you be free from your passion and pride there's power in the blood and the blood [Music] [Applause] precious [Applause] [Music] there's power in the blood power and the blood says [Music] there is in the precious [Music] there's power in the blood [Music] [Music] [Music] thank god for that kind of grace and there's that kind of power power and the power to take a power to take a a wreck on the side of the road and make a real christian out of them like brother i love that sermon perfect strength by perfect weakness because brother brown lays down that that god can take god can take flaws and make jewels out of them power there's power in the blood let's sing it one more time there is power [Applause] [Music] [Applause] in the precious [Music] [Applause] there is [Applause] [Music] and the amen lord god we're so grateful to you lord god for that kind of power lord and we just ask your blessing upon your people now lord as they go their separate ways and go home lord jesus that you'll protect them and be with them on the way home lord god and lord that you'll just manifest your your love and your power to each one of them lord god we're so grateful lord for your work in this day and for your word and for your the gospel message that we've heard bless your people now we pray in the name of the lord jesus christ i think brother wade has something to say so
