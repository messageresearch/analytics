and things and this would be like a regular service called we hate to miss the whole week the weekend you know we're not - what do you call it we're not commercialized or whatever or Christmas has got to be this and out of the other you know I mean I like presidents all year long I mean I like that I don't carry don't have to be Christmas it can be any day with a life at us at home you know and I tell them I said my lord you don't want to wear the Thanksgiving to cook a turkey I mean you can cook him anytime you know so we just have a good time all over year-round you don't know and just appreciate that okay father we thank you for this day in your grace thank you for the children Lord and then putting on their program for you Lord and to show that they love you Lord in knowing showing them that your grace is truly sufficient to have come down to mankind to can that we can talk about a savior and the Lord who the world is passing by and not seeing in the right way they're doing their thing Lord and that's all right but we just do hours to try to worship you and have a good time and you forgive our sins lead us Lord in your grace and love in Jesus name Jonah - and but I will sacrifice unto thee with the voice of Thanksgiving I will pay that that that I have vowed salvation is of the Lord now remember what it means salvation means deliverance all right you're captive you're delivered whatever it is see then we'll get into Lord willing Wednesday picking up into the basis of starting the new warden new testament at least but it said now verse 10 says and the Lord spake unto the fish and it vomited out Jonah upon the dry land okay now we read this the other day but I want to read it again and try to pick up the thoughts from Genesis 15 and we'll start with about verse 7 - just cut it down mean and he said unto him I am the Lord that brought thee out of ur of the Chaldees to give thee this land to inherit it remember we're in the Old Testament we're dealing with natural things it starts with dealing with land and things inheritance land you know giving you those things the Covenant then it'll move into thy seed and the seed then we'll get into the New Testament as it brings into the salvation of the soul but remember back Darnell their salvation was to follow what God gave for them and they had a salvation and that a place to go to if they died they went to paradise you know the Boozman with Abraham so don't forget those things and I keep saying it cause on the internet system somebody come along and say well this that or the other so at least they can pick up the thought alright what's what's now as he says and he said Lord God whereby shall I know that I shall inherit it land right he said unto him take me a heifer three years old and she go to three years old and around when three years old and a Turtledove and a young pigeon and he took unto him all these and divided them in the midst and he laid each piece one against the other but the birds divided he not and when the fowls came down upon the carcasses Abram drove them away and when the Sun was going down a deep sleep fell upon Abram and lo and horror of great darkness fell upon him and he said unto Abram know of a surety that I seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not theirs and shall serve them and they shall afflict them for hundred years and see you go over into Exodus when that picks up and you'll find it it'll say there say God remembered his covenant he made with Abraham you know the in other words telling exactly he said to be there for a year he remember there are four hundred and thirty years because they rejected just going out at that time so that calls from 30 years all right but still God's right is 400 years okay he said they'll serve the image will afflict in 400 years and also that nation whom they shall serve will I judge and afterwards he'll they come out with a great substance and I shalt go to thy fathers in peace that shall be buried in a good old age but in the fourth generation they shall come here there again for the iniquity Haman rights is not yet full and it came to pass that when the Sun went down and it was dark behold a smoking furnace and a burning lamp that passed between those pieces and in the same day the Lord made a covenant with Abram saying unto thy seed have I given this land from the river of Egypt and the great river the river Euphrates now watch what he said and in the same day the Lord made a covenant with Abram saying unto thee unto thy seed follow that as we get to it in a minute see he's not just dealing with Abram he's movin over and out - but he's not moving over the seeds right so we'll have to hold that point when we get to it in a minute father we thank you for this day in your grace we committed all to even Jesus name you may be seated now remember I thought remember what we've been dealing with remember how that we're talking about the fact that God made three covenants okay his first Covenant he made with Adam and he told Adam said now don't you eat of that tree of knowledge and everything will continue as it is they'll carry right along see that was this covenant to give a covenant always remember carry something with it - you know I'll give you the land well you know what you get the land alright so then he told him he said now everything will run all right said you just stay away from that tree all right now remember God saved Adam by grace he's not lost remember how we brought that out we brought the the grace coming before the sin you know God before the foundation of the world right all of that coming down remember the whole message we put into that point just to get your thought and then make anywhere you'll remember what I've been trying to say the atom was saved by grace okay God supplied an atonement alright then he jumps on over if you want to make sure of the atonement you'll find it will enter relate it in a minute with Abraham he jumps over to genesis 3:15 promises christ to come and show and then that truly adam was saved not lost but he didn't stay with what god told him so then it was a conditional covenant he had a conditional cut if you do this if you stay here everything's alright if you don't it's going wrong well he didn't stay and it went wrong all right the next covenant was made with Noah and he told Noah he said there's a salvation laying here he said I'm gonna destroy the world but he said now I'm just not gonna wipe I'm not gonna lie elated I'm gonna wash it off but he said now you build an ark and you get in that Ark and that'll be your salvation the grace provided an ark for the saving of the days of Noah I don't want you to get too far in thinking a lot of times see because I know how my mind runs and I failed to keep relating you think I keep repeating oneself I'm not repeating I'm trying to get you to think to keep your mind in the right channel see then Noah was saved by grace because any covenant everyone so ever anything has to be grace so when we talk a minute about in about Abraham and an unconditional covenant see then your mind will follow what about Adam well what about Noah alright so now we're covering that they were saved by grace through faith of believing what God gave them in Abram is same as Adam and Noah he could look to genesis 3:15 and see the promise of the coming of Christ the seed of the woman not seeds the singular seed of the woman to be able to bring forth their you know to deliver them alright cuz it'll all time when we get to Christ at all time you'll see he paid once for all for what was back there as well as over this way all right now so follow that order so then we see Abraham comes down he comes he starts Abram goes a long ways in his journey as the word Abram you know then we found that he started going through things because God had given him an unconditional covenant all right as I said it took a prophet to learn these things because the scripture we read we would just think Abraham went to sleep or Abram went to sleep no Abram was taken out of the way to showing what kind of what it would be that it would be an unconditional covenant all right now to start that off with I want you to think about what is unconditional name he said well it means no conditions that's that's fine that's that's good it means no conditions all right but you know what Webster says it means he said it means that it's not limited follow that later on is not limited it's an absolute now an unconditional covenant now when you talk about it now listen we'll get to back in just in a minute now what do you think about I wouldn't be listed unconditional covenant a covenant is a wonderful thing but do you realize that God to Abram gave him a covenant you know what he done then he doubled that covenant by swearing now we will read it in the scripture God swore that's all right for God to tell you something right but how much more sure can you believe anything when he swears you know I mean we're supposed to take our words you know and do and and everything but what about when somebody Swire's according to that well we can still file up ourselves but God cannot change his mind even though he justs made a covenant or made a thought but then he comes in swears by it what about that to go with it that's wonderful isn't it you know that the word unconditional actually means unqualified see when you're unqualified you don't have to qualify again that's the best way to say you know unqualified we think about his meaning that it's not worthy well that's right Abraham wasn't worthy nobody was worthy but now remember I thought reading to put that in there Adam was saved by grace he had a covenant but he broke the Covenant he didn't stay with it he went to that tree all right Noah had a covenant he built the ark he comes through in the ark but he turned over and went back to the tree of knowledge and died a drunk all right because that's the way that things are done but then when it's given to that just remember one time Noah and Adam wouldn't lost those grace had already provided all right now if that be true I asked you that question that Noah and Abraham and Adam will say by grace then how much more sure with the covenant be with Abraham and you know it's gonna be a grace covenant because grace comes before the law right remember the law comes wailing over in Exodus 19 all right so then just keep in mind that no matter how far you can go back grace goes back further than that to cover it all right now but to get us out if I don't get nothing else we'll get this talk why would God give Abraham an unconditional covenant we see and we know that man can't keep a covenant true your man can't keep a cone and Adam didn't do it nor didn't do it they couldn't keep the Covenant right but why would he give Abraham an unconditional covenant he puts him to sleep as we read there which means really the Prophet said he took him totally out of the picture to show him that he had nothing to do with it it wouldn't be anything there wouldn't be any point door of do's and dont's all right there's not a do's and don'ts in Abraham watch the point now hold it real tight because you'll find it in Abraham he says I'll give you this land he said I'll give you this seed I'll give you all of these things under no condition now there's where we fail now I'm not throw stones at nobody no problems of picking on churches I'm preaching here oh you go to a Baptist Church and they'll teach you a doctrine of basics called once saved always saved what now does that mean it now I didn't believe it back then see this back when I was there and then I spent 50 something years ago I didn't believe then that you could live like the devil and be a Christian I always thought the way you live prove what she was I mean that's that's just the basis of it if you live like the devil then you the devil but see I've heard it preached and you've heard people talk about it well I know that person was saved like I said that guy that killed all them children and everything if he was a good Baptist and standing in good with the badness they might have been embarrassed about it but when they preach that God funeral they would put him in heaven you said oh no they wouldn't well then they'd have to deny their own doctrines but what does it mean to have an unconditional covenant well it means there's no conditions in it then you can live like the devil and get by with it no yeah but you just don't understand I know I don't understand our way of thinking god I never thought that to start with brother Branham didn't have to straighten that out with me on the basis that I could live like the devil and still die and go to heaven I went through too much of that I know that brother didn't live too good but he paved the parking lot and he believed he confessed he might have been a pervert but he's in heaven now come on Church you remember where you've been and the places you walked I may have emphasized it a little heavy but it is to make you think about it but what does it mean an unconditional covenant well God saw that Adam couldn't do it and he saw Noah couldn't do it so he just come on the scene with Abraham and just you solved the problem and just said go live like he won't - it's gonna be unconditional and show me that in the Bible or this prophets message show me any were mister prophet had ever taught you could live like the devil and still be alright and show me any pointer any thought you could even try to think about something like that we see here is what we are you have a brother Dale we all have problems we all have troubles you know well none of us are perfect this was a good one they used to say and be on a bumper sticker I'm not perfect but I'm saved I thought if you saved the saving is what made you perfect and I don't sound good does it when we analyze what people are saying about it they're saying I'm not perfect in you out and you know how do you think you perfect you know what I begin to the basses are playing to people to say that to me the Bible says that I am the Bible says because I'm a born-again Christian I'm perfect and the Prophet said I'm just as perfect as God is by being in Jesus Christ is that brag in our do it well then brother daily don't make no deals what you're doing you're going to heaven anyway you've got a lopsided view of Christianity because I thought Christianity was to deliver us from our problems I didn't know that it okayed the problems what do you think you're perfect you live a perfect life nobody in Jesus Christ he made me perfect because that's my atonement I am a human being with the mistakes that's why the Bible says then to the born-again Christians that you're going to give an account of the deeds done in the body whether good or bad now show me anybody in the Bible that ever went on the basis of they don't matter what I do see when you start talking about it don't matter what you do then there's something else talking there besides Christianity something else is in boiling in your thoughts this is the way I believe it and this is the way I appreciate always have on one time you realize becoming a Christian brings more conditions upon me as a human being than it would be if I lived in the Old Testament because if I lived in the Old Testament I could probably qualify pretty good you know I mean I could be like a rich young ruler I could say all of these I've done from my youth see that didn't save the man what are you understanding listen to the point what does it mean unconditional you said this means no conditions to it is that all you can believe is that all you can do then nobody's going to hell they're gonna have to do away with hell that's you know comes nobody ain't going have you been to a funeral lately as a priest it's a person going to hell nobody's going there anymore it's done away with my because well you can't condemn me for being wrong cuz you're wrong too but you see when you start using excuses you admitting you do not know what you're talking about well it really don't matter what I do because I am born again if you're born again I talk now that maybe the Prophet was wrong when he said maybe he was wrong maybe the Bible was wrong when it said you know the things I do I would not the things I would not this I don't do Paul was bringing you know what I mean and he said then it's not me that's doing those things as soul and being but he said in my flesh there's nothing no good sure we're human beings in flesh we do wrong right we better believe in an unconditional covenant but we better believe in it right and not believe that it gives you a right to live like the devil and you're still going to heaven you ought to be more concerned today about your salvation than you ever have in your life if this message doesn't bring into view a greater understanding of salvation and things and what it really is you know and the truth of it well you've missed the message could you never hear the Prophet said it's okay if you do that we all understand because we all have problems you never heard him say that you never heard the Bible say that but you hear the Bible speaking of it you hear the prophet speaking that the way I live the way I live is displaying what I am right then where would he give you a right to go out and do anything wrong why would it not be then we ain't even got to Christianity yet I'm dumb that new Tesla we're still an Old Testament why would David come forth from the bed of Bathsheba Ron cuz reach about well that's where he's coming from and he said the Lord restore unto me the joy of thy salvation and why would God say I gave you these offerings to make and told you how they were doing what they would do but said my nostrils that follow your offerings and sacrifices but said I would turn understand a contrite heart that's what David had why didn't they kill David for taking Bathsheba well who's a king no don't don't do none of those time that prophets very first words as quick as David said bring that man here I'll kill him that's done that he said David you won't die the very first words read it he said David you won't die cuz I prayed for you God made an acceptance through that prophet was no difference with David or anybody else but an honest and a contrite heart why would any thought be in our mind that we could get bow at any time well I don't have to tell my wife about running around because nobody knows it but mean mm-hmm yeah what about it what does it mean unconditional to you does it mean something like that did he doesn't matter what you do cuz I got another question coming behind this we might take another message but why would God give to Abraham and his seed a covenant but he never made it with mankind he never made it with all the seed of Abraham I'm quoting brother Branham we'll get to that one we'll get time did God just say well it don't make no difference what Abraham hears all this I'll just grab him he's a pretty good when I'll pick him up so you're not listening the Prophet said it like this and I got him here in front of me he said God knew he could trust Abraham to teach his children oh he just picked him up one mm-hmm we'll get to that in a minute just remember this covenant was never made now listen he made a covenant with Adam he didn't make the covenant with the world he made it with Adam come on he never made the covenant with the world he made it with Noah in his seen his children when he come to Abraham he never made it with nobody but Abraham and his seed singular which is Isaac what does it mean then the unconditional covenant can you just live like the devil and everything's okay you know that's the basis of what mankind teaches and one way or the other cuz come on if you get down to the base this people will say you think you perfect we all have problems don't we you know where you're eating off huh you're eating off the tree of knowledge because that's what mankind teaches that's what your churches teaches that's not what the Bible teaches the Bible says you've given account for every idle word or deed brother to hell no you're not gonna be lost we just remember another point right here if you live like the devil you're not saved anyway if you think you can get by with anything without God knowing it or anything like that then you're eating off the tree of knowledge then you're dooming your own sail you sure don't preach a good salvation message I'd like hear you preach it but I thought the the Bible in the message said Abraham was unconditional now number two question why did he give it to Abraham never the whole world full of people right probably as many peoples are now maybe not as far up to Abraham coming but it'd be pretty close they'd probably a few billion by the time Abraham come on the earth at least a few me young why do you pick Abraham remember where Abraham come from read you Bible he come from the earth Saudis which was a heathenism and your prophet verified death and he said Abraham come from even you know the Abraham wasn't a Gentile no he was a Jew boy you know a lot about your Bible don't you Abraham was a Gentile a healer and worshiper in God one day said Abram just get your family and head out of here to a land that I'll show you you want to talk about unconditional covenant you answered that question to me why did he choose a bride I'll put another question on the end of that why did you choose you oh now we've got a little more down whoring think about it right now we got to the point where we won't enjoy it a little bit why do you choose you hmm that's one of the people this message don't understand predestination the random said I'll give it to you the minute he said only the predestinated are considered in Redemption only the predestinated he said are considered in redemption there's an unconditional covenant that he made Wow so your thoughts runs on what I can get by with and can't get by with or do this is out of the other and how can it be done mine ain't even running that away mine's running why did God choose him got that down some races were choosing a Brian he wasn't the only good guy in lamp why'd he choose him after he chose him why'd he give him an unconditional covenant what'd he give it to him cause he he was gonna save him he's proving he's saying you can quote brother branham the remember there's a lot more to be said then once you're quoting you can find what you want in the message and justification of anything you think about can be found in the message but I don't mean this right so we're dealing with it on what an unconditional covenant that means you just do anything you want to if that's your thoughts of unconditional you don't matter what I do now you quote brother Branham Lee you're a good cool you no matter what I do is what he's done right but remember if I don't set what he done he can't do anything for me remember an unconditional covenant would mean he not save everybody in the world you ain't listening if he gave Abraham an unconditional covenant that meant there was no conditions no thoughts no ideas of anything whatsoever the way you're thinking then why didn't he say the world come on will you I thought I understood that until you started talking about you explain it to me is it okay for Abraham to do anything he wants to and God won't condemn him but everybody else gets condemned for doing any little thing I have to admit sometimes it looks like that until you wait on God to give the answer because that was David taking a man's wife away having the man killed to get his wife to cover up his sin condemning his own self and said bring the man here I'll kill him how many other people in the land got killed that year for doing the things David done come on grace stepped in grace said David he won't die cuz I prayed for you what if the Prophet had never said that David would have died because the law would have commanded it remember any mark against a high priest or anything like that automatic death why would God spare David then seemingly change the entire course of his word and his the way he had been with everybody you don't understand and that prophet not said what he said David was a dead man but he said David you won't die cuz I prayed for you got a lot of why's the main point is why would our thoughts of unconditional want to run into a situation they don't matter what we do we can get by with it now quote your prophet now quote the Bible the Bible says only Christians sin I'm quoting brother Branham down with it the Bible says only Christians sins because the sinners condemned on a higher level he just out of it may I quote you another one your prophet said you sin a sin as a Christian what'd he say come on some of you that steady the message that I what's the rest of that quote you sent us in as a Christian he said you'll reap a tubful I thought is unconditional I thought it's unconditional well now if it is unconditional how come he kill the other man you know you're gonna run real quick I know the human mind okay that works because if you said that to me I'd run real quick guys how many minds run that way this then he tried to justify some thought because he had run over here grab it say but he didn't make it with everybody he made it with Abraham now we're down to a point why did he make it with a brow you would have run that far with me I'll run with you not sarcastic I'm just trying to tell the truth what I'm trying to tell you is if you stay with the Word of God don't you worry about it in straight not ever little isn't and schism and whatever we've got if we'll believe it you sent us in as a Christian you're gonna reap a tubful out of it is it alright if you just go out and live in adultery and have kids and all kind of things and run all over the country as prostitutes and peel heads and and everything in the book but just you're gonna help me anyway could I believe in God I call I thought the new birth we'll get to it when we get there I thought the new birth was to come inside of us and live in us I thought that was the thing that could not happen in the Old Testament so now you've got an unconditional covenant in the New Testament that I just give you a couple of conditions with see the scene as a Christian reputable that's a Christian only Christian our sins giving the counter these done anybody whether good or bad that's New Testament that's telling you in the New Testament we can't live like the devil God don't live like the devil I thought the way we live was feeling what we were and then how much worse could it be how much worse could it be to live like the devil didn't do wrong and then try to use that to justify this unconditional I'm saved anyway if God saved me if you ever heard that one if God saved me this is his job to keep me clean it's your job to get in the bathtub all right you got a little bit do with it ain't like mama was mama wouldn't let us go to bed with the kids out playing in the dirt no we didn't get to go to bed until we washed our feet of course that was only about three or four inches at all you had to wash didn't matter about the rest of it they'd wash our feet before we went to bed listen church this has been on me for months and months so I got to get that part out at this point here what do you mean unconditional well he made a code with Abraham unconditional now let's see if we can put some thoughts with Abraham just a minute and run a little little thoughts in her mind first off God may have never made the Covenant in Abraham with the whole world he only made it to Abraham now come on you show me any words else what if he made right for him he made what everybody no way no no way you're out of the word you're out of the message yeah but you're trying to make yes that's what I'm trying to make it I'm trying to make it to a point that there was one man you won't talk about an unconditional covenant there was one man got an unconditional covenant right not the whole world God never made the Covenant with the whole world he only made it with Abraham you said in your mind and drive it down I know somebody it's backing out from because you can't father what I'm saying but listen he never made it with the whole world listen to brother branham go up to number one let's read it call Israel in the church listen to once your prophet had to say all right we find then taking the church back just as for a little preview found out that God promised Abraham he would save him and give him an unconditional promise what unconditional covenant he would save him and his seed not all his seed so the Covenant was not made with nobody but Abraham transmitted to Isaac I used the word where I wanted to brought down to Isaac if small was his son with no covenant now let's read what he said he gave you an unconditional code and he saved him and his seed not all his seed but his promised seed Isaac know what Abraham had eleven sons you know that only one of them was the promise through Isaac that's the reason Paul now watch him ain't chritmas scripture said in Romans and not chapter that all that are Israel are not Israel what did Paul say all the Israel is not Israel because there's only one chosen come on but through Isaac shall thy seed be called now then God through Isaac represent in Christ we noticed Christ was in Abraham and Christ was in Isaac Christ was a Jacob no so now you're coming down to the final point but just remember God never made to Crete never made an unconditional promise or covenant with nobody but one man well you sure don't give us the change I didn't write the book I wasn't a god it made the statement show me in the Old Testament where anybody outside of the seed of Abraham now listen the seed of Abraham through Isaac the seed of Abraham to East small had no promise oh yeah I'll give him a land I'll make him a nation I'll do these things yeah I'll go to you yeah I'll call these Abraham physical seed but there wasn't no promise made to nobody in the days of Abraham but to Abraham and then it said unto his seed not to 12 not to a small list through Isaac know if you've read your Bible then you surely should know but yet you say an unconditional covenant oh I understand an unconditional come why did God give the covenant to Abraham and him only now we're gonna hit a little line called predestination we're gonna see if we understand predestination not predestinated I'll make it but if I predestinated I'll guess I won't make it that's pretty good sense that's don't take a lot of knowledge does it if you is yes if you ain't you ain't what so this going out live like it know what that brother Dale I never thought about it I never thought about it it was just made with Abraham I thought it was made with the whole world I thought it was made into Noah for the whole world it would have been if they had accepted it walked in it it would have been to Adam if they'd accept it and walked in it it would be to the Israel if they would accept it and walk in it but they won't walk in it because then they're gonna prove whose seed is who okay go ahead and number three thy seed shall possess the gate of the enemy then when God seen that he had a man he could put confidence in he said I swore by myself now who's this guy he's got confidence in he's owned down here okay why did God choose Abraham then when God seemed that he had a man he could put confidence in he said I swore by myself for a man always takes an oath to someone greater than he and no one was greater than God so he swore by himself that the seed of Abraham would possess the gate of the enemy oh my he swore to God by himself swore that Abraham's seed would possess the gate of the enemy he goes on said and he proved it what about it drop over to 15 now and jump away over to Macy's right to the end 15 which is the message called the faith of Abraham you got it Darfur this is from the message of faith of Abraham what therefore by election he chose Abraham no it's unconditional he just picked out who he wanted you don't listen we just got through reading one quote in seeing that Abraham was chosen for a certain reason we're putting conditions on an Old Testament situation what are you believe it or not I'm not doing that your prophets doing this therefore by election he chose Abraham for he knew what Abraham would do you remember when he called him out there and said he'd he'd not keep the thing a secret from him when it was going down to destroy Sodom and Gomorrah he said for I know that Abraham will teach his children I know it God Himself I know that Abraham will send this message on down from one to the other generation but God for knowing that and knowing that Abraham would do it then he told Abraham in the beginning that he would save him and save his seat after him Oh give him the unconditional covenant that he made with Abraham not because Abraham was good that because God was good what about it seems now we're pulling a little bit in the Old Testament of finding for some reason not that God just give it to him at an unconditional no but there's some reason he chose him go Ahead's the next one 15a I guess you got it listed on there you can see it 4:15 there's a lot in between here so I'm Bob - Hall now Abraham was called by-election Abraham was election Isaac a justification Jacob was grace and Joseph is perfection now in the beginning when God called Abraham he called him not because he was a good man but because God foreknew Abraham God knew what Abraham would do he knowed Abraham he said I'll know that Abraham will raise his children to fear the Lord God knowed him God knows you but I don't understand an unconditional covenant it just means there ain't no conditions to it now we've got a prophet explaining predestination about the way God chose and how he chose Abraham how did you choose you wrote down I can't put it on nothing but unconditional in my life because then you don't fit with Abraham and remember now got him laying here in the scriptures and everything if you don't believe it raise your hand from Abraham the promise was made I gave it to you the other day from Abraham the promise was made to his seed after him and he said not as unto seeds then the same promise I read it to you life son or Wednesday or Sunday everyone else preached the same promise come from Abraham to Isaac and he said to Isaac your seed the seed of Isaac the Bible brings the seed of Galatians 3:16 and unto thy seed which is Christ all the way from the promise to Abraham by faith brother Dale then it would help you've left us all out because you've only got the condition with Abraham I didn't write the book now we got a long ways to go only you'll need separate 5 o'clock instead of that's not as you hope there's enough know in my mind of feel that length of time you see church as we leave the Old Testament form of talking we've got to remember one time ain't be any difference back dar then he is over here is that been the constant statement you can't make him one way here another way over here so here he is in the Old Testament with billions of billions of people in the 4000 years of the Old Testament you know what I mean everybody in the world and it reproducing and dying and going away and billions of billions of billions of trillions of people and yet God made a covenant with one man because that was the only man that he found in the earth that qualified to be his seed Abraham was the only man that qualified in any connection to be able to link to Jesus Christ I didn't write the book we made one of these days find out the Bible's right when it says fear not little flock we might find out like it was in the days of Noah when there was eight people saved out of a world full of billions we might find out that there was a handful of believers believed in Jesus Christ and it was you're walking the shores of Galilee well yeah we're all believers believers of what come on brother brother Brown don't say about predestination he said it wasn't that God chose one and didn't choose the other no one he said it's not that God puts you in a pop now I'm gonna let here feel me to read him raise your hand and pushes you through the other side and called you an overcomer he said how does God predestinate those that he foreknew he did predestinate so foreknowledge falls into view I don't understand you've got to hold those have some without it when one man no I I got the old Old Testament tied up with one man in his seed after him which was Isaac and from Isaac come who Jacob who comes down the lineages after work and from dark you come to Christ I remember you come to Christ you don't come to Mary and you surely don't come to Joseph with any human lineage is any human thought of lineages that you would talk about Jesus coming through David coming through the different ones that was brought it all winds up in Joseph oh you haven't read your Bible lately it ain't changed I read that in the Baptist Church you know still large since I read it in the Baptist Church that the natural lineage father it 14 generations from here to here 14 generates from here to here so means generation here to here he winds up in Joseph he don't go to it Mary Cody don't go to the women that's number one we still wouldn't fall right Marie might have been of a good lineage but she probably wasn't the lineage of the Joseph was Joseph come from the lineage got to remember it was told him which one was it oh well somebody help me which one that says out of his knees will come a ruler and it's not Jesus never come from no tribe of Levi but Judah out of Judah out of Judah comes the lineage down the Christ that's where you come through David and all those things there is no natural lineage coming to him because he's not God I mean not man he was God he's neither Jew nor Gentile he was God Rogers was Almighty God there's no Linnaeus to run him to but if you're gonna run your lineage you're gonna run aground in Joseph but no you ain't in the ground like you think I've been waiting a long time for somebody to preach this one without getting it messed up why did it go to Joseph I got a lot of wise about the Bible why did it go to Joseph why because he was the son of even the son of the sons only two competitors understood I'll tell you what you never hear nobody talk about Joseph too much well let me put a little bit in this message about him he's the prize of my eye because he was a man and a lot of things he done was wonderful he realized had he not accepted Mary number one now and many of the others would have done it you remember that God was in the Old Testament of when the man was told you know pay the right yeah man said huh I'm not gonna do it because if I do said I got to take Ruth and she's a Gentile and I ain't having nothing to do with it I will feel a lot of good stories Joseph was a wonderful man do you believe God when all he had was a dream fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife a dream he goes and marries a woman to keep her from being killed because the law was killer she's pregnant before being married than any man Joseph took her as his wife are you with me can you put it back there with Ruth and Boaz and think about it back to her that guy says no I ain't gonna do that what was it Ben if you had a little woman come up to you and you said you know she said I'm pregnant it was automatic death and he was the one because she was engaged to him he would have had to cast the first stone but instead of casting a stone he cast salvation into her lot of the fact of saying I will redeem I'll take the responsibility of all this I know you don't like me that unnatural explain we just remember Joseph and Mary lived together for nine months and he never knew her I say he's a good man you make light of that if you want to guy say he was a good night you know here preached on Joseph - you got to be this got to be a woman got to be that part gonna be that one ending it with one thought God chose Abram because he knew what he do and he knew his seed would follow after him through Isaac not to east walls not to end the other would be through Isaac and through Isaac would come this one in this one in this one and it would come to Galatians 3:16 and to thy seed which is Christ not as seeds of many Paul said one seed of course everybody in the message is born with a seed in right oh you hear our seed doctrines they never preach the true seed and explain how did it come down and how that listen to what I'm saying how to end it who Abraham the Bible said he believed God it was counted unto him for righteousness right Joseph believe the dream it was counted unto him for righteousness can you believe God speaking to you why would we want to think about some unconditional situation that we can get by with right why would we think about something that it's just totally unconditional brother you don't understand it he just said he's gonna save him we didn't make no difference where he won't be saved or not I want the quote I won't now I can't get too close but I want to quote these things gonna save him whether he want to be saved or not because we remember old or new God cannot override your free moral agency and save you if you don't want to be saved now are we making a sensible thought of unconditional I said sensible cause it's still in my mind why would it be made into that thought of line and then God turned around and swore by it it's what I got all these scriptures in between here that God would Swire to Abraham but you see that comes right down to where you and me are had because we got to be the seed of Abraham by faith you and I are not Jen not Jews but remember Abraham wouldn't you either so quit trying to be a Jew try to be an Israelite well you'll get there one of these days go remember jacob's name had to be changed to Israel and then he could have the twelve sons right he wasn't anybody else bringing him twelve sons you had to come to Jacob and then get Jacob changed to Israel cuz even Isaac and all that it wouldn't come out like I write see the word is right he knew what Abraham would do I know that Abraham will raise his children to fear the Lord God knowed him God knows you what about it could it be oh brother Tom love this one could it be that we trigger our predestination brother Pablo is one of his favorites he said could it be we trigger our predestination sister Gayle could it be the fact that we believe God when others would not believe him it's not how good your life is see there's you do's and don'ts come on you tryin to find something to make you and I'll tell you to do this if you'll do it I read them and I studied them cuz I've been doing it for two or three weeks I wish you would type into your computer unconditional covenant 180 some 870 snow I forgot exactly it's a large number of times they brought around amused and I'd like for you to read every one of them and I'd like for you to find in all of that quotes that he has any thought whatsoever that it doesn't matter what we do or don't do were saved anyway because when you start reading it this is what you're going to find you're gonna find the total opposite because you're gonna find the quotes is running to the bases that we think we can get by with anything hi for that way the other hive is condemning us constantly about what we do and don't do never a middle-of-the-road I never found out of all that I read of those things I didn't read everyone but I got pretty close I never found a one where he ever said it don't matter what you do because that would be totally contrary to any form of God's thinking and by foreknowledge I just don't get it I don't understand it pray and listen and think it's never been what you do or don't do I'm interstate it one more time Adam was saved by grace okay Noah will save my grace Abraham was saved by grace that not of works lest any man should boast and I love it to where that scripture that's one of my favorites I guess where's that abraham believed god and it wasn't counted unto him for righteousness why cause he believed him as I said well ago what would you be if you were the man and you your future wife was there and she was pregnant she doing you know in a dream at night and something says go ahead and marry oh this is me it'd be hard to do folks right be hard to do what they done it cuz they proved that they were the seed of Abraham that would believe God regardless of all the things that would ever take place that they believe you how about it okay don't know if you might have any need without prior you know how no music will do nothing will go right on the end of the rest of the service you know they can
