speaking the way they speak when he puts it on two times because we're so slow till it speeds it up and it makes them caught like them's it's free to them Yankee people I don't know how they won the war I have no clue no clue hey but anyway good have him with us today you got your Bibles we know where we're going we're going to Daniel 9 and I'm going to go ahead and get to get the board out brother Danny's done lost his post up here you some things about a grandbaby or something so I don't know what in the world's going on grief some grandchildren heavenly days yet please but we are I'm gonna make some announcements to now the announcements that we make are also brother Joe puts them up on the on the website so if you ever have a problem look on the calendar in on our website and you'll see what's going on and we've got now we're in November good grief we got November and December so let's go run through it real quick if you want to write it down if you don't just look on the website alright next Sunday I'm gonna be gone I'll be in Illinois doing some deer hunting so and then I'm leaving Wednesday sorry Aaron's gonna preach for you winds tonight but I got to leave winds the after after I get finished work on November the 17th we're having our dinner Thanksgiving dinner one service and then we'll get with all the others about what to bring so November the 24th brother Chris long will be with us that is the Sunday before Thanksgiving because dad and I are leaving on the 19th and be going to the 24th that's the week of gun season in Illinois so that's where we're gonna be and he'll have some of the brothers here preach on Wednesday you okay we did good okay all right so then on December the 8th brother Joel Forney will be here on December the 15th will be our Christmas dinner and brother Michael Teague will be here that Sunday to preach for us that'll be a special treat he hasn't been here in a long time December the 31st Chris long will be here to do our watch night service and that will be on the 31st of December so just kind of give you that for the rest of the year going up I went and posted it back there on the calendar on the wall and brother Joe's gonna put it on our website so that's kind of what's going on for the next month or so so let's begin and try to maybe I'm not gonna finish it today because what I want to do is is I want to finish the chart of the three periods this will be three period part three periods part two but what I'm going to do is the next time we preach which is going to be in somewhere in November or December because I just read you all the other ones maybe it's December I mean November there's something I want to take and and the contention in the message and the people are is there's two schools of thought whether there's one year left after the rapture or three and a half years and they take it by quotes because we have been here long enough to know I read you the Bible there's one week left after the rapture so there's no I don't need a quote for that I just need Bible but you got to make the quote match the Bible and we can make the quote match the Bible if you listen to what brother Branham saying he didn't change his doctrine at all he said what he meant and he meant what he said all right so there is no contention in this church but there is contention and other people and this is like brother Brown said one day he said I'm not here to bring a new doctrine he said I'm here to straighten out the doctrine all right straighten out a doctrine that has been many they've been contested many times in ministers meetings and bike even when brother Dale was going to ministers meetings up until just a few years ago so we're going to go through though and prove it by the Bible I believe we have but today we're going to go through the three periods according to Scripture and place it in the Word of God and then the last thing I'll do is a couple of Sundays from now I'll bring those quotes that seems I said seem to be contrary and the quotes that we that that are that I'm going to read to you today is that okay so that's why it's there is some quotes from the prophet of God that seems like he's saying two different things but he's not he cannot listen one more time he cannot say what the Bible doesn't say he can't make his own Bible we can't make our own Bible god forbid we we know he was a word prophet so everything what he said had to fit in the Word of God alright so because remember as I've been reading to you face final resting places where in the Word of God all right so face final resting place is in the Word of God so may the Lord help us today in let's bow our heads and ask you okay now really we good okay stop me if I sure enough if I get too fast okay all right Daniel 9:24 let's pray Heavenly Father thank you today for a Time Lord that we've set aside that we can talk about you just a little while we know the cares of life and the things of the world are are bombarding us on every hand we we we don't have time hardly for anything but Lord at least this one time we can sit here and we can hear from you Lord and strengthen our bodies Lord in and keep us strong Lord and keep us tentative where we can can hear from you Father may it not that they hear from brother Wei today Lord may they hear from you father may they hear you Lord speak your word back to them and Lord then you'll be the one do the speaking it won't be wrong you're the one to be the revealing which you'll never be wrong if it comes from You Father we pray this should be with the ones that are not here today Lord ones on the highway the ones that are sick the ones that are sin stick Lord we pray this you just touch them now Lord many people in this congregation Lord got loved ones and husbands wives daughters sons that are not serving you Lord we prayed today that you'll touch their heart Lord it's getting to be a Time Lord where we truly don't need to be playing around Lord we need to be earnestly earnestly earnestly praying for the ones Lord that are that we want to come in father we pray that you'd bless brother Russ Lord as he goes back home tomorrow that you'll take care of him give him strength Lord give us all Lord today our daily bread and we're coming to a communion time today Lord we pray that you would sanctify us Lord cleanse us and keep us Lord clean father as we were talking yesterday there's a daily cleansing Lord today washed us by the water of the word so that we can take this communion Lord and truly be a communion a love affair between us and you Lord we pray that you'd be with us now sanctifies Jesus name we pray amen Daniel 9:24 says seventy weeks are determined upon thy people and who is that Israel or the Jews and upon the holy city which is Jerusalem to do six things to finish the transgression to make an end of sins to make reconciliation for iniquity to bring in everlasting righteousness to seal up the vision and prophecy and to anoint the most holy know therefore now look know therefore so you say you got to know this know therefore and understand that from the going forth of the commandment to restore and to build Jerusalem unto messiah the prince which is who jesus christ shall be seven weeks that's one period and threescore in two weeks that's the second period the street shall be built again the wall even in troublous times and we're going to read that in the scripture today out of Nehemiah and after that word after I'm going to show you how close that is and the Prophet brings it right straight down and after threescore in two weeks shall Messiah be cut off but not for himself who was he cut off for us and the people of the prince that shall come now who is that Titus shall destroy the city in the sanctuary because in AD 70 Titus drove rode into Jerusalem and destroyed the city and took all the menorah and he took the holiest of holies and all the different things took him back to what Rome because he was a Roman general and that's where you're gonna get the building of the sanctuary here a little bit later the physical one and the end thereof shall be with a flood and to the end of the war desolations are determined and he shall confirm who's that he'd that's not Christ because he's going to break the Covenant Christ doesn't break a covenant that's the Antichrist and he shall make a covenant with many for one week that's your third period and in the midst of the week what's in the middle of seven three and a half he shall cause the sacrifice and the oblation to cease and for the overspreading of abominations he shall make it desolate even unto the consummation and that determined shall be poured upon the desolate you may be seated in the Lord at his blessing to the reading of the word I'm going to read you a few quotes if you'll pull up we're going to read probably one in two and in the Book of Revelations we're going to go in into the Bible here but I first quote is from brother Branham a six fold purposes seventy weeks are determined upon thy people for what purpose for what whose people was it determined upon now remember it's not to us Gentiles but I do want to show you one thing that the way God does things he does in continuity and we're going to be able to see that that he does he can't do anything different than what he's already said in his word he can't change it he can't even modify it it's ever done it's ever unchangeable alright so who is it to Daniel's people the Jews and what was it determined for upon not only Daniel but upon Daniel's holy city like I said before that's your key there's two things got to be restored because what are we talking about in Daniel 70 weeks we're talking about redemption our restoration to restore all things back to its rightful position so Daniels Holy City now class what was Daniel's holy city Jerusalem all right now let's go to quote number two we've read these before just want to kind of help our ones that haven't been here these 70 weeks of Daniel just read the read these 70 weeks of Daniel covers from the going up of the church until the coming back of the church and that space is what it covers now not all 70 weeks of Daniel part of it he's talking about the six fold purpose now listen remember we leave this place according to revelations four we go in a rapture revelations for one John is sees an open door and says there's there's a voice that's come up hither so in Revelations for one we go in the rapture that's after the church ages are over we go in a rapture there ma'am and we're not seen again until revelations 1921 when we the wife has made herself ready us and Christ ride back into this millennium and then alright so what goes on right here is to the Jews now what back here is has to set it up to where you come to this last week that we're going to talk about in just a second alright we'll take the first period and walk our way through it and make sure everything's okay now look watch and seventy weeks are determined upon thy people now remember that is all that the journey of the Israelites will have in this earth they are determined seventy weeks is just determined that's all that's lauded to the Jews therefore the seventy weeks and I don't miss it it will reveal from that time to the end of the Jews and also to the end of Jerusalem all right what is the end of Jerusalem the Battle of Armageddon is going to destroy everything so that would be the end of Jerusalem as everybody got that say man all right until he says a new city is built and that will be the city in the Millennium according to Ezekiel 43 44 do you need these quotes you know you're okay you can see them okay okay God don't let me get too fast so now let's go to Revelations and let's see how this is going to happen the culmination is what we're looking at but then we're going to back up and go all the way back in the history I read some commentators online this week and of course they've got the same school of thought that a lot of people in the message is God they've got they've got one school of thought that Jesus fulfilled three-and-a-half of the seven of the last week he fulfilled it when he was on the earth and there's only three and a half years left what they've done is is they put this section back over here all right you can't do that you can't do that and be right you can't do that you can't you can't save the Jews over here the Jews get saved when we leave hey man that's just to me that's just plain Bible all right so revelations 11 verse 1 there was given unto me a reed a reed like unto a rod and the angel stood saying rise and measure the temple of God and the altar and them that worship therein but the court which is without the temple leave out and measure it not for it is given unto the Gentiles in the Holy City shall they tread under foot forty and two months everybody got that that's what the Bible says and I will give power unto my two witnesses now who is that according to the Bible who is that Moses and Elijah the spirit of Moses and the spirit of Elijah on to Jews that are going to be the two witnesses and they're going to prophesy one thousand two hundred and threescore days so 1260 days is the time that they're going to preach thereby got that same amendment right that's the time they're going to preach and they are going to preach not here they're gonna preach right here and if you've got your you got your chart this is the chart that brother Branham drew during the Daniels 70 week series like I said we asked George Smith which married sister Rebecca and Rebecca's the one that drew this he said yes that is the exact thing she drew for brother Branham during the time of the 70 weeks of Daniel so if anybody doesn't have one you want one anybody want one anybody else wants one just let me know all right but that's the same drawing we got here I just want you to think I'm not drawing this chart for for my purpose I'm doing it exactly the way brother Branham had it when he drew it and preached the three series of the seventy weeks of Daniel so what's going to happen is they're going to prophesy 1260 days which is what exactly three and one-half years according to the Jewish counter the prophetic calendar of 360 days to a year not 365 and a quarter okay we're going back to the prophetic calendar of 360 days to the year all right we know that according to the Bible we look over in Genesis 29 I believe it is where Jacob worked seven years for Leah and seven years for Rachel and then the Bible says he fulfilled her week so one week equals seven years all right there's 70 weeks of Daniel times seven years we are looking for a total of 490 years to fulfill the 70 weeks of Daniel because the Bible says 70 weeks are determined I read you the Bible so we got to find 70 weeks are 490 years which is 70 times 7 even the brother from the University of Georgia shouldn't know that you went to Georgia Tech you might not not to go our Florida weight out to go a little bit slower but that's 400 we got to find 490 years because 490 years finishes what look what I drew from the time on your chart to where this theme begins to where this thing ends it's got to be 490 years now you got to take out the engrafting of the gentile tree all right you got to take that out because they cut him off he turned to the Gentiles through Paul and Peter and all those different ones and this is a Gentile Church age this has nothing to do with the 490 years it's inserted in here because God took and divorced Israel can't marry her anymore so he marries a bride but he can't forget Israel he's going to take her as servants the 144,000 are not going to be in the Millennium as bride they will be in the Millennium as being servants to the bride in the temple you're going to see in a little while they build the temple we don't build temples we're there on a honeymoon why would in the world would you want to I mean Jen and I been married 40 years we may not have if Ida had her start building a house today after we went on our honeymoon vacation time rest we've come to our restaurant here when we take a rapture we've entered our rest actually you've entered it now you just got your body's got to catch up to it amen but now what's got to be redeemed now watch what's going to be redeemed for you and I brother Dale was talking about the whole creation groaneth in travail that's what for the manifestation of the sons of God - whereas brother Dale said in the adoption series where brother man I think it was where he said it takes us back to the Garden of Eden well now this is not heavens forbid this is not the Garden of Eden this is the garden of the devil this is Satan's Eden but what's it going to be by the transforming power that transforms you and I and changes our body in this dimension he's going to take us out of here destroy a lot of things during the crit tribulation and then the Battle of Armageddon destroys everything what's it going to do it's going to bring us back to an Eden condition in the Millennium alright so you and I but really our time is no longer right here and truly when you get born again brother man said you were sitting in heavenly we are sitting in heavenly places right now in your soul you're right here because you're eternal you have no time we have no set 490 years and deaths and that when the when Christ came and put one land on one foot on land one for don't see any raising hand he said time shall be no longer now we look in the book of daniel about daniel 10 11 or 12 maybe 12 I think it is you see one put a foot on one one on the land the one on the sea he raised his hand he said it for a time times and a dividing of times so it would be for three and a half years to restore Israel to people but you got to remember the city also because it's determined upon thy people and the holy city God promised them a city alright our city like I said before our city is worth thousand and some odd years over here the future home is our city the Millennial temple is not our city the millennium is not our time cuz it's time we're not in time we're eternal people walk right back into time just like we left the place only everything is gonna be cleared off alright and we're gonna be there with 144,000 fifth sealed you ever how you want to put that in there but it's going to be a thousand years till we get to our home over here and that future home is in you according to Revelations John saw the bride or the city coming down onto the mountain as a bride adorned for a husband what was it all the bride all the bride coming down because remember like I've always said when the window you read the paper and it says Minneapolis all of Minneapolis came out for this parade well all the all the buildings didn't hop out to the end of the street it was the people the people of Minnesota the whole city of Minnesota came out Minnesota came out to see the parade will you would think man all the buildings and no it's not the buildings it's the people it's the people so you and I were the people of the city we are the city you can't separate them okay well now let's get to them because you're gonna do the same thing with the Jews I'm gonna want to bring you a little something that the Lord showed me yesterday that it helped me out a lot even more so now the two witnesses going to prophesy now they listen let's let's do the let's deduct this thing keeps moving when when to the two witnesses show up not when we're here right so it's got to be if we're gonna take rapture it's got to be over here somewhere they didn't show up here to do 1260 days they're gonna show up over here somewhere because the two witnesses are to the Jews only not to us everybody all right with that say man all right so they gotta show up over here so the 1260 days is gonna happen after the rapture but we've got some other things to take care of we got the three periods now what's going to happen is when the two witnesses come on earth they're gonna preach they're gonna open the seals they are the sixth seal the prophet of God said they what they speak in nature does exactly what they tell it to do what it's getting ready for us to come back because you know what we got into speaking condition right here hey man we got into speaking condition here because you're gonna have to speak your body change a man said you got to come in speaking condition right here and then what comes off of us is just going to go over to the two witnesses and they're going to come into speaking condition all right and they're going to what rain fire do all these different things for 1260 days then the Bible says they will be killed in Revelations 11 they're going to be killed laying the streets for three and a half days all the world's going to see them they're going to just fall in love with each other because they've killed these two people that have just destroyed the earth then what's going to happen God's gonna resurrect them and send them in a rapture okay all right when he sends him in a rapture what's gonna happen the Battle of Armageddon will begin and destroy everything on the earth by an atomic battle it's not gonna be a battle of God against no it's like brother Dale says he's looking for a battle there's Protestants and Catholics that's what it's going to be it's going to be the two factions that turns against each other and you got Israel there in the middle and they're gonna be everybody's just going to start punching buttons and this is going to be chaos but we're gonna be up here somewhere in another dimension it's not gonna bother us not going to buy the 144,000 and the two witnesses the only thing that's going to be destroyed from here to here is going to be the land and all the evil people that are here they're by alright with that saying ma'am alright so now you got that so we looked at the six fold purpose that's the first thing we covered I told you if you understand the six fold purpose you'd understand Daniel 7 two weeks because what happens with a six fold purpose seventy weeks are determined to do six things finish the transgression make an end of sin make reconciliation for iniquity that's people not buildings that's people you don't redeem buildings you redeem people all right but now the other three is to bring in everlasting righteousness seal up the vision and prophecy and to anoint the most holy so you can't do all six right here they can't be three and a half years left after the rapture that has to be one week according to the Bible to fulfill all that we've been talking about alright because what's going to happen let's read this one quote let's skip over through all we did all this back several months ago or a month ago on a watch let's read number three the 70th week of Daniel prophet of God preached this is the last in the series he said now the six full purpose we find out that on this sixth purpose I'm going to skip to number six because it should be right over here alright the sixth full purpose we find out that most holy always represented the church now who's the church we're the church with a bride not 144,000 with a bride we're the ones that went somewhere right and we're coming back in revelations 19 21 to somewhere to the earth everybody alright with that say ma'am alright so now look always represented the church the tabernacle and the last thing was to be done was to anoint the most holy that's the Millennial tabernacle that he'll live in during the Millennial that will live in that we will live in because we're gonna they're gonna build it and we're gonna live in it now they can't build it over here because it's gonna get straw and destroyed in the Battle of Armageddon it's gotta be built here at the end of the 70th week and then it rock just rolls right over into the Millennium everybody alright with that I'm just reading what brother Branham said all right and according to the Bible there's one week left after the rapture all right so let's read that let's look at your three periods of time like we did the other day and then let's set them in order according to the Bible everybody all right okay all right here we go three periods of time Daniel 9:24 says seventy weeks are determined the red know therefore and understand that from the going forth of the commandment to restore and build Jerusalem that's when it begins right here unto messiah the prince which is jesus christ there's the cross a t30 watch to build jerusalem unto messiah the prince shall be seven weeks and threescore in two weeks the street shall be built and the wall even in troublous times now let's stop right there because I'll read the rest later on let's go to before now let's outlined Daniel seventy of weeks now I might repeat here again ministers of the gospel if you disagree with this all right they have been for fifty years they are divided into three periods as we find out in Daniel 9 three periods first a seven week period right here look and you look on your chart a seven week period then eight three scouring to watch threescore 60 thirty times two sixty-two weeks got it which is sixty-two and then a one-week period they're divided in three different periods now I've got it divided here on the board the first period I'm sure he's pointing here the second he's pointing here and to my understanding by the gospel by the Holy Spirit that the end time God returns again to the Jew there buddy got that say man that's to me that's just pretty black and white and simple alright it's written in black and white and red all right so now let's look at number five just want to make sure you know that brother Branham said we know now that each week meant seven years have you got it let's say it together what those of you that are asleep one week equals seven years now we know we got it one week equals seven years all right now brother BAM look says here we are right here first week brother Brown steps to the blackboard 49 years to rebuild the temple now this top line represents the Jewish right here the Jewish nation as it goes across just in time this is just time then it drops down out of the Jewish nation into the Gentile time this is right here then goes up again and catch Israel and goes on am I reading that right am i looking at it right am i interpreting it right I just read you what he said okay everybody got that now look let's go to number six mm-hmm and let's remember now everything now is going to be based off of the Christian our prophetic under there's only 360 days to the year that's what this right here everybody alright with that excuse me 360 days not three uh seats five and a quarter the spirit of wisdom comes into the church to make known to the church that's you by the revelation of the Holy Ghost bringing the church in and revealing what day that we're living in just the same as Gabriel come to Daniel the Holy Spirit comes to the church in the last days would that be today and reveals these great deep secret things everybody got that mm-hmm just reading quotes alright number seven we'll get into this now this is in the 70th week now you see that brother Brahim didn't preach the seventy weeks of Daniel he preached the 70th week so he's going to preach the 70th week so there must be one week anyway just it's just really simple if you look at it and forget what you've been taught because if it ain't according to the Bible Nate right hello according to benefits according the Bible whatever you believe this country to that's not right brother Brown said either one's wrong and one's right both can't be right okay or both can be wrong now we are told from the going forth of commandant now watch we're gonna get started now here's where the trouble is in other words you said now we are told from the going forth of the commandment to rebuild the city to Messiah and Messiah was Christ shall be seven weeks now he's fixing to start right here so works where we're gonna start today and seven times sixty-nine makes four hundred and eighty three years now we got to find 490 right shake your head yes some of you were already shaking your head it's just not coming back up again the only decent Chili Peppers or something four hundred eighty three years we found that 62 and seven is what 69 69 times seventy is what four hundred and eighty three or four seven is 483 years everybody got that pretty simple and seven times sixty-nine makes 483 years now you gettin it down if you want me to run over it again I'll be glad to do it now we are told from the going forth of commitment to rebuild the city of Macomb massage she'll be seven he's quoting scripture 7 that's the first right here 7 times 7 is 49 years everybody got that seven weeks and threescore and two mate 62 and seven and 69 so right there we're right here everybody got that seven times 69 is 483 years therefore until the Messiah now we're coming to this part here until them aside this is at Calvary right here there's got to be 483 years all right let's continue with quote number eight the message you see this morning it's drawn out here on the blackboard here it's just merely to mate to explain as I go along to try and make that you might understand what I'm trying to speak of so if this is what he had on the board this is what he used okay and this 70 weeks of Daniel has been one great study two days and two nights almost I've been since the end of the week here I've been on it trying to find out what words to say for truth look it's got to compare with the rest of the Bible see you just can't take it just one little scripture and make an understanding then say well this is what this and then turn around say well but over here it says something else contradicts that it can't do that it's got to say the same thing all the time if you don't want then you're you're wrong and that's the way I've tried to teach it that's the way we've tried to teach it here now let's just read number nine oh what a lesson I said to my wife the other day I wonder if the people are really getting it now I want you to get it see he's not wanting to make it a complete mystery you want you to get it if you have to stay here all day long just stay now we want to get it some of you may not want to get it he wants to get it he wants you to get it we want to know that it's truth and you if you can just only see it and I ask maybe then afterwards I'm gonna leave the chart hang here and you can draw it out and that's what Becky did she drew it out and put it on a memo graph paper come in here this afternoon whenever you want to and draw it out the charts and so forth it'll help you to understand that's the reason I put it there so that you would understand it thereby alright with that it's your profit telling you you need to understand it and he's gonna give you a chart to understand it alright let's go now to Daniel 9:25 now we've done read nine Daniel 9:24 9:25 know therefore and understand that from the going forth of the commandment to restore and to build Jerusalem now what happened is is back in this period of time when Daniel was in captivity all of Jerusalem laid waste temple was gone they knocked the walls down they destroyed Jerusalem that's why the captivity was seventy years but it happened back over here the literal 70 years everybody got that we already went through that all right but we've come up to a time now to where Daniel is know therefore and understand that from the going forth of the commandment to what rebuild so Jerusalem laid waste over here so what what the people what Israel wants to do if you'll even remember in Esther of the book of Esther they were under the dispersal at that time they were scattered everywhere but they wanted to come back together now see how this is one of the Lord was yesterday he brought them people back together to build a temple under Nehemiah and Ezra two prophets to build what's he gonna do here he gonna do the same thing he's gonna bring two prophets right here but you know what happened we had two prophets o Paul and brother Branham we had two prophets Paul the Alpha and Omega that doesn't do away with these people brother Brown called them prophets but remember Luther and Wesley were not word prophets like brother Branham and Paul were they were reformers and men but Paul was not a reformer Paul was what bringing them out of Pentecost bringing them into the new age of the Gentiles and then brother Branham finishes it up the two prophets to the Gentiles that what now what happens when they come together because remember brother Brown said I preached what Paul preached right eivol Reese what Paul preached and I say plus but what happened he brings Christ on the scene what happens to these two witnesses when they get finished with their 1260 days they bring Christ on the scene they bring a rapture these two prophets brought a rapture when Christ come on the scene he went in a rapture amen so it just kind of all it all fits the way God brought everything together you said all the Jews are different not exactly because Redemption is not replacement Redemption is taking what was that had failed and bringing it back to the same place all right so he's got to do the same thing with us to bring us back to the Eden Lake condition so know therefore and understand that from the going forth of the commandment to restore and to build Jerusalem unto messiah the prince right here shall be seven weeks and threescore and two weeks the street shall be built again and the wall this is the key because it took him a long time to build everything because what we're going to read in a minute is when Jesus was here and he said there won't be one stone left on another the the Pharisees looked at him and said that building was 46 years building that temple they were correct the walls weren't built though the walls and the streets were not built and listened all commentary will tell you that a that a nation is not a nation I mean in other words they wanted to build a temple well you could have built it out in the middle of the wilderness but that would have been their city of civil government you have to have a wall for what defense and you have to have the streets to what get around on so to make a city it's not just the temple it was the temple and the walls in the streets cuz that's what the Bible says shall be built again the wall even in troublous times and we'll read that now in just a minute now let's read number 10 we okay Louise okay now I've got some writing here that I'd like to read as we go I want to show we're gonna look around here and see I always wondered how brother Branham picked March to 14th 445 BC now short tinea second now the going forth of the commandment to rebuild Jerusalem which was on the fourteenth day of March that's pretty precise you really can't find that in history you can't find that in the Bible but it's written in the Bible it's written right there in the Bible you just gotta know what you lookin for and I did until I actually had to read another commentary to see what it was so uh yeah yeah I read another commentary from somebody else if any of you want to put that down in the Hebrew you'll find it called in Isan Nissen is their first month of their year it is March April it's not exactly March and exactly April its March April rustle everybody studies it knows that's the first month of their year now it's not the first month of their civil year their civil calendar starts in October we went through that downstairs I don't have time to go could up here but it's on youtube if you want to watch it but look you'll find which means March the issue was given on the 14th day of March how do you find it the 14th day of March I'll show you this you went forth to build rebuild the temple you understand it as you people have read the scripture them so it must be in Scripture until it was completed it - 49 years to complete the temple and the city to rebuild it and as the Bible said here Daniel speaking or the angel to Daniel that the walls it would be built in trouble as times trouble sometimes and many of us remember when it was built they had a mortar block in one hand and a sword in the other hand to watch for the enemy and it would be built in trouble as times now let's go to Nehemiah 1 now what happens is if you'll read and Ezra the book of Ezra and by awake the book of Ezra Ezra gets this function to rebuild everything but he doesn't go through with it Bible tells you if you read the book of Ezra it's that dormant that's what they've done is they went started a little while and equip because Nehemiah this is how perfect God is if Ezra would have started it it would have been starting in like 450 something BC which wouldn't fit with Daniel 70 weeks they had to start in BC 445 to start building the temple to get all your dates right so Ezra if you read an Israel you can't start with Ezra because it won't work out but look let's go to Nehemiah 1 we got it up here so you don't have to go through the through the Bible just read it right here the words of Nehemiah the son of hatch Aliyah and he came to pass in two months just learn the 20th year as I was in Shushan the palace that Hannah and I one of my brethren came and he and certain men of Judah and I asked them concerning the Jews that had escaped because remember this they had dispersed which were left of the captivity and concerning Jerusalem and they said unto me the remnant that are left of the captivity there in the province are in great affliction and reproach the wall of Jerusalem also is broken down and the gates were burned with fire so in other words it was laid waste so Nehemiah and Nehemiah let's go to Nehemiah chapter 2 now you can you can read on through I skip through this for some time near my to verse 1 now what happened and what who was near my little history here Nehemiah was the bear for King Cyrus or whichever King it was okay he was the cut' bear he was the one that gave the King wine he was so important he was he was one that the King trusted when he brought in the wine and he listened to what the King listened to what name I said because what happens is watch this this just to verse one and it came to pass in the month listen so we're in March okay we're in March he said hi brother I'm get March 14th fixing the prove it to you right here in the 20th year of our desert seize the king that wine was before him now you got to go back into history wine was only presented to the king on Passover and Passover is the 14th day after the first of the month yeah that was one of those Google moments that wine he never served him wine until that day of every year he would serve him wine and that's where you come up with because remember you got to go back to the Passover God tells them he says you take the lamb and put it up on the what the tenth day of the first month then you keep it up for four days and then on the 14th day you killed the lamb so brother Branham goes right here and says okay this happened on March the 14th 445 BC because that's what the Bible says and he gave it to the king now I had not been before times sad in his presence so Nehemiah was sad why was he sad listen wherefore the king said unto me why is thy countenance sad seeing thou art not sick this is nothing else but sorrow of heart then I was very sore afraid and so unto the king and said unto the king let the king live forever I should not my countenance be sad when my City the place of my father Sepulchre life waste and the gates thereof are consumed with fire so to make a long story short let's go to near my 4:17 in other words the king is fixing to given an edict or a what he's doing is he said okay I'm giving you permission because what he's got to do is they're not in Jerusalem okay they're not in Jerusalem at that time they're in Shushan the palace artaxerxes Medes and Persians but Nehemiah's going to have to go to Jerusalem to build it well he's got to go through all these countries that hate them and he's got to have something in his hand that said hey the King told me I could come and do this and that's what this is they which build on the wall and they that bear burdens with those that later than everyone with those hands rot in the work when the other hand held a weapon now what did they say in Daniel 9 that the wall shall be built even in troublous times for the builders everyone that had his sword on his side and so build it in other words sort in one hand trial in another hand and why did that happen if you'll continue and read near mine for 1517 down through there what happened the other kingdoms didn't want them to build back because they knew that they had a God then there was some history they had a god that answered their prayer and they had a god that said if you'll just turn to the palace or turn to the temple I'll hear your cry so that you know what nobody else wanted them to build it why do you think they're trying to kill them now see that same devil was right here today trying to disperse the Jews again because they know if the Jews get everything right God's got to come to them same way back then in near my 4 verse 15 watch and it came to pass when our enemies heard that it was known unto us and God had brought their counsel - not that we returned all of us to the wall everyone or to his work and was all the Sirians and I don't know what their name was in but what happened was they try to get in there when at night or whatever and they try to tear the wall down they've built it all dam built it all day and then here comes the enemy and tear the wall down at night so anyway Nehemiah said hold on a minute and it came to pass from that time forth half of my servants we're working in the other half held spear shield and bow what happened was that army was this way looking out into the desert and the ones right here were building the wall in trouble astounds half of my servants that's why it took him longer but remember they built that wall in 52 days once they got started what a supernatural happening all right it came to pass in that time the half of my service rotting the work and the other half both spear shields and all that the ODE near my 417 and they which builded the wall and they that bear burdens with those that were laden every one one hand wrought in the work we read that and the other hand held a weapon look at verse 21 so we labored in the work just to save time so we labored in the work and half of them held a spear from the rising of the morning till the stars appeared so they built the wall in trouble as times and they built it in 49 years from the time they started BC 445 I'm not going to get into the dates they built it in 49 years they finished the wall in 52 days when they finish the wall that's when they became a civil government again all right there buddy got that so it's the wall so we remember it's got to be the city and the Jews all right let's go to the that's the first period the first period of time they built the temple and the wall in 49 years but now we got to get these sixty-two weeks or 434 more years well it's all history just keep reading in your Bible read all your history just keep continue reading now remember let me get throw this in for just a second as you read your Bible it's not in chronological or it's not in your order everybody know that if you didn't you do now it's not in your order you look if you got a Scofield Bible the dates jump around but what man did when they were putting a Bible together they're the ones that put them in these in the order they're in now but if you'll go online you can get a like a lineage from who their job supposedly is the oldest book all right Genesis is not Joby's but the writer and then if you look those times you'll see how those time Nehemiah Ezra Zachariah all these different ones were inside all this and they kind of all intertwine but if you'll read that you'll understand more of what's going on right on up to we know that Malachi was the last one and there was 400 years between Malachi which the back I came in here 400 years between Malachi and Christ okay just to give you a little history to show that but look now everybody understand the first period then Nehemiah BC 445 it's when the edict came down or the contract that Cyrus said I will protect you as much as I can you go build a city and the wall thereby understand that because you go back to the New Testament they're going to say we built the temple in 46 years that's the temple not the walls in the streets because it says walls and streets even in troublous times so they built that for 49 years that's your first period we're going to talk about now the second period so let's continue on everybody okay know therefore and understand from the going forth of commandment restore and rebuild Jerusalem until my side of the Prince shall be seven weeks and threescore and two weeks the street shall be built again and the wall even in troublous times now watch here's the net here's the part we're going to talk to about and after watch this this is how specific that everybody thinks brother Brown made so many mistakes now he didn't make a few slips of the tongue cuz he said ad 33 and him in AD 30 he said four hundred and thirty-eight years instead of 483 years that's just human we got to stay with what the Bible says alright Bible says that now watch but now watch this now remember remember that date remember March 14 if I got that remember that day March 14 the day of the Passover in the month of March which now remember the first month is March April because it doesn't go March cut it off April cut it off there their calendar is different than ours everybody got that cuz Nissen is actually half of March half of April all right the brother branham brings this date in really specific because watch what's going to happen because remember the Bible says look the Bible says after threescore in two weeks all right so you got a seven week period you got a 62 week period so after 62 weeks the Messiah's going to be cut off now when was he cut off at Calvary is that right say ma'am that's when he was cut off so it says after 62 weeks now a lot of people interpret that is is that now that after 62 weeks that'll bring that three and a half years in no that's not correct that's not right that's not right at all because inside this watch what's going to happen you watch our brother Ram brings these dates in watch remember March of 14th everybody got that remember that because watch this next quote now we are told from the going forth of the commandment this is virgin umber 11 now we're told from the going forth of commandment to rebuild the city to Messiah and the Messiah Christ of course shall be seven weeks and threescore and two weeks making sixty-nine weeks everybody got that sixty-two plus seven is 69 it says after 62 weeks the Messiah's gonna be cut off now where was he cut off at Calvary he was cut off now watch I want you to watch how perfect this is now you gettin it down if you want me to run over it again I'll be glad to now we are told from the going forth of the commandment to rebuild the city to massage she'll be seven seven that's first right here when he goes first right that's right here seven and three scoring to mate 62 and seven and 69 all right seven times 69 makes 483 years therefore until them assign now we're coming to this part here I believe he's pointing right there until them aside there's got to be 483 years so there's 434 and there's 49 if you add those two together you get 483 everybody got that but now watch what the Bible says says after 62 weeks now after 62 weeks only Kim has gotten to be one day the day after tomorrow you got it okay so no watch watch him bring it right here now now Jesus the Messiah rode into the city of Jerusalem triumph on the back of a white mule remember on Palm Sunday now what is Palm Sunday that's the week before the resurrection has everybody got that same am that's the week before the resurrection got it April the second 80 30 Jesus rode into Jerusalem on Palm Sunday ad 30 they eat it went forth on March the 14th now April the second is a week before the resurrection so he died on Friday well actually Thursday before Friday before Saturday right he the Passover was on Saturday he died on Friday before 6 o'clock we went through this I hope maybe we'll go over it again remember Jewish Jewish days start at 6 o'clock or end at 6 o'clock in the afternoon then a new day starts that's why they had to get Christ off the cross before 6 o'clock Friday afternoon to keep from going into Passover which was on their Sabbath which is on Saturday if I got that same am all right so this is April the second so what is you got March 14th and April the second he was crucified our cut off four days after that right Palm Sunday Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday he was cut off on April the fourth which is after March 14th March the 14th would have been here April the 4th is after the 62 weeks ended but just barely by a few days you don't have to be but just might a few days for it to be after 62 weeks so you got to go by what the Bible says the Bible says after 62 weeks Messiah will be cut off so he was killed right here it would be ad 30 April he actually killed 1 April the 2nd 3rd 4th 5th 6 so that's after the sixty-two weeks was over the sixty-two weeks was over you bring this in and you bring the 49 and 434 years you bring it right here so after 62 weeks he was killed do you remember you remember where that is in the Bible it's in the book of John where Jesus rode into Jerusalem and it throwed the palm trees down and they said Hosanna to the king I believe that was like John 12 you'd think it would be so you see from John 12 to the end of John when he was crucified there was a bunch of chapters in there there's chapter 17 where he goes and prays will he's praying during that whole time from Palm Sunday till that Thursday he was really busy he actually preached the seals during that time Matthew 24 was all during that time leading up from April the 2nd till April the 6th when he died all right so everybody ok with that just wanted to say after 62 weeks the Messiah was cut off now watch let's read number 12 and many people let's get back to this just for a minute you even look in Scofield in different ones that says ad 33 but if you go back in your history and we proved it several years ago that Jesus was born around 4 BC because that's when Herod came into power then you got to take your two years whenever he said all the kids 2 years and younger kill them all because he was born somewhere around then 4 BC so 4 BC to AD 30 that make him 33 years old he said there's no way you don't have a 0 year it goes 4 3 2 1 1 2 3 4 5 6 to 30 there's not a 0 year when he went from BC to AD everybody got that so he was 33 years old we know that but he was crucified in the year AD 30 and even brother Branham in the seal book refers back to Matthew 24 and says it happened on these dates in 80 30 he said they asked you this was how specific how do you know that he was a prophet he said they asked him one one question in the morning remember then they went back and actually and the other two questions in the afternoon I God had to show him that because we weren't there and it's not in the Bible so same way with this with this March 14th it was right there in the Bible we just didn't know we had to have a prophet come and bring it to us that March the 14th was the Passover day when he gave him the wine so how interesting is that number 12 now does everybody understand up this far those of you that are awake now does everybody understand up to this farm if you don't then you know what you got to pray because I can't reveal it to you I can just show you what's going on and God's got the ability everybody understand up this far that it's perfectly the truth it's the Bible it's the prophetic years now we come up and we get them up here to the rejection of the Messiah see from to the rejection of Messiah the last week he's talking about right here because he's come up to the killing of Messiah then the last week what now I want to stop right here just a minute and explain this that when they rejected the Messiah was when they of course rejected Jesus as Savior and crucified him you remember over here when the Bible said and he shall be cut off but not for himself Messiah the Prince now think how close that prophecy hit I just showed you how close it hit I want to get this drilled into you that if that prophecy hit exactly to the date exactly to the time and exactly the way it said it would these other seven this one seven weeks left him corrects itself one seven years rather seven-day seven years will hit exactly according to the scripture what's the last seven he's talking about the third period that we're fixing to talk about just a second have I got that just reading what he said now remember he was cut off Mossad Jews God seems to deal with them they did not go any further then they were scattered by the Roman Empire and have you noticed on my chart here I want you to get this now and draw it you noticed here where I got the cross he's got it right here now what he did was and you're drawing it he's got he extend this out just a little bit and put eighty seventy so that's very important because remember what happened in eighty seventy some of you've been over there dancing over there russ has been over there about four times he knows that wall there's almost obliterated there is no Tabernacle there's hardly anything over there that was original when Jesus was walking on the earth because remember he told him he said this he said skorsky was talking about his own temple when he said destroy it and I'll raise it up in three days but they literally destroyed the temple back in eighty seventy so what's what brother mom says here I want you to get this now and draw it you notice here where I got the cross that's where they rejected but the time extended out just a little bit further on that see why 30 40 50 60 70 40 years later and I see he proves it again that Jesus was killed in 80 30 because he said 40 years later is 80 70 got it 80 70 Titus the Roman general destroyed Israel Jerusalem and scattered the people to all the world now why they'd they scattered now what's happening over here when we bring that last profit over here what are they doing they're coming back together cross comes on the scene he takes a rapture he goes up comes back down in the form of the Holy Ghost coming down here Titus destroys the literal temple then God's building his other temple the Gentiles he's building the temple right here not not the wood not the wood in the bone I'm in the woods and the stone the bone and the flesh and all that yeah he's building it right here so he sends a prophet in the end of this thing - what introduced the same Crocs that was over here preached the same three-and-a-half-year message that was over here to us as what we were talking about the other day from spoken words original seed brother Russ has been taking 1260 days and going back from brother Brandon when he was when he had the accident back to - Grass Valley California he preaches Jehovah Jireh series and but and from that all the way up through spoken words original seeds the actual perfect man all those things we're building up in the 12 we got hey we got a message of three and a half years brother Byrne said it's the same exact message that Christ preached over here now look that same exact what I seen yesterday that same exact message from about right here - right here was not preached the same way does that mean you don't know what I longed about the furrow between the eyes father son Holy Ghost wasn't the original no no eternal hell they brought all that in right here that's not original God had to come back and bring a prophet like he did it first to bring it back to the original so we got the original Jesus never preached that he was the second person of a Trinity he never preached that you had to baptize her name of Father Son Holy Ghost he didn't preach that was an eternal hell what so the same 1260 days he preached right here he preaches right here and here very consistent all the way through because Christ what Christ came back what Holy Ghost brought the original word first couple of ages and then 325 AD about the end of Martin's what it starts going down horrible doctrines brother Brown says the loose ends well what the loose ends have to be done they had to be tied back up in a three-and-a-half-year message starting as brother Dale says started in the 30s 40s 50s then you come up to the 60s and brother branham and spoken words reeling seed said as of yet Malachi 4 has not been fulfilled so there's the 1260 days to restore us back to the faith of the fathers and then bring his message and then bring his message of this revelation that's what struck me yesterday I told thank you Lord it's just a pattern that that it's so simple that anybody ought to be able to understand that it's the continuity brother Brown said the continuity of the message and I believe it's the continuity of the Bible there has to be continuity in this message of the hour so there's your 1260 days or three and a half years a preaching Paul preaching then everything fell across here comes back three and a half years to restore it back then you've got three and a half years 1260 days preached to the two widths of it from the two witnesses to bring 144,000 to a rapture what a mighty God we serve would you say that sister Joanie say it again Sam sister Joanie said I I won't sister Johnny to say your name nonsense Ernie I love that amen every time you see her and you say something to her she says what a mighty God we serve she's lost a lot of that New York accent thank goodness we can understand her now I want you to get it took now watch let's get back to our thought here we are Titus the Roman general destroyed Israel and scattered the people to all the world Titus forty years later so actually the Jewish time extended until now look God wasn't dealing with him he quit dealing with him at Calvary with the Jews as a nation he's not going to deal with the Jews as a nation - right here but he was dealing because remember the 120 in the upper room were all Jews so they did start with a Jewish root but it went and turned to the Gentiles everybody got that same answer brother Browns not wrong he's telling it exactly the right thing hmm God wasn't dealing with them he only dealt with them until they were ejected Christ then when they crucified Christ they said let his blood be on us and our children it has been ever since but before they got scattered oh brother before they got all scattered to the world that take God look it took God 40 years to tear the temple up but once they've been taking watch him right here it's taped but it's taken 40 years to tear up the temple and scatter them to all the world but God failed to deal with them anymore God failed to deal with him anymore he went dealing with the Gentiles you know that understand it now now we start in the church ages the Gentile time well in another quote he says God has been bringing and spending almost that much time bringing him back into the homeland all right so let's read this real quick let's get to the very last one that's the last that's the sixty nine weeks or 483 years - ad 30 April the 68030 when Christ was cut off he started dealing with the Gentiles now there's got to be though 490 years to finish Redemption right to finish the people and the city all right you've only got 483 years you've got a city or a tabernacle laid in waste even the walls not hardly there now but what's going to happen right here they're going to sure they're going to try to build it right here and start temple worship that's why I says the sacrifice and oblation will cease but that's not the one that to finish Daniel seventy weeks they got to build the temple that me and you walk into so you can't finish it right here or right here it's got to finish right here so there's what we've got 483 years we got to find 490 that leaves what seven years are one week he's seven years there's seven years left now listen to what I'm saying real quick and we'll read these quotes and we'll be done there's one week left of time listen to me there's one week left of time to finish Daniels 70 weeks I proved it by the Bible now there's only twelve hundred and sixty days of the Ministry of two prophets left but that's not to finish Daniel seventy weeks that's inside of Daniel seven newly everybody got that because the Bible says there's one week left this this god this man this Antichrist when we leave he's gonna strike up a agreement for what seven years what the Bible says he shall confirm the covenant with many for for what one week one week equals seven years and in the midst of the week he's gonna walk into that temple they built and he's gonna say I've got this is the one you've been looking for right here and they're gonna get so mad because that's gonna be a Gentile walking inside their temple and that's a no-no and they're gonna get so mad then guess what's gonna happen he's gonna get mad he's gonna kill two prophets he's gonna kill one hundred forty-four thousand and then what's gonna happen they're going to take a rapture so that what the Battle of Armageddon can begin and to finish the 70th week you got bringing everlasting righteousness seal up the vision and prophecy in the North the most holy that's got to happen right in here they got to build that Millennial temple you say how it's not to us it doesn't matter there is time left though because they got to come back down here and build it so that we in Revelation 19 21 can ride into the Millennium and go into that temple so it's got already be built now watch let's read these three quotes and we'll be finished 70th week of Daniel number 13 then we'll be done then we'll take communion now we find out that down through these ages we have the Holy Spirit come in and then God back in the beginning began to tell them at the rejection of Christ where's that right here God showed John exactly what would take place during the Gentile reign what John the Revelator revelations one two and three all right now you haven't got any limited time like the Jews but we got sign we got a signpost well God did with the Jews just exactly what he said he would do in them 69 years or 469 weeks or 483 years so I just showed you he exactly done the right thing he eat it on 445 BC - right here now remember that's only 475 years of six 365 and a quarter but if you put it make it 360 days it comes out exactly to 483 years I've not got time to do that and it's just us figures but we got a sign when he said he would do in them 69 years or 483 years but 69 weeks and one week left one weeks yet determined I don't know where people can't understand that one week according to the Bible is yet determined now we cannot apply it in here now look he tells them we can't apply it in here now look where is the Gentile part of this whole of this whole picture where's the Gentiles right here right here he says we cannot apply it in here see that's what the people the message do they say there's only three and a half years left this is not a part of it and that three and a half years are stuck over here somewhere in this first church age or back over in that way can't happen according to the Bible according the prophets message and you can't stick the Jews and the Gentiles together you can't do that brother Brown tells us over and over again you can't deal with the JIT he doesn't deal with the Jews and the Gentiles at the same time doesn't either we gotta be out of the way tor they've got to be out of the way all right now number 14 on the 70 weed now my Pentecostal brethren now about y'all hold a witness brethren do you realize do you know where 144,000 appear do you know where all the great miracles of Revelation appear over in the Jewish age not in ours now are they gonna peer over here are they gonna peer here I'm reading a quote over in the Jewess age not in ours there's nothing recorded in it just the church getting ready and going out sure with the power of God we can work miracles and exploits we know that but the real thing was over here to the Jews I mean the real working power miracle working because remember them two prophets they're gonna do whatever they want to do now look the 144,000 don't appear there I believe they're over there I believe they're over there now this is so close they can't be babies and they could be older people but they've got to be over there somewhere right now waiting on us to take a rapture and then God's going to go straight to them what a mighty God we serve 144,000 don't appear there they're over they appear not in the third chapter what's the third chapter revelations the church ages their own over in the scripture further revelations 11 and now we see that all this stuff was to take place was over in this time of the 70th week the last week now if they've already had 69 weeks and lived it exactly the way God said they did and it happened exactly the way God said it would do then there's one more week promised to the Jews how much more plain can you be number 15 and then we'll clues he keeps talking something in Pentecost musta got him because now he's saying the same thing again now how now Pentecostal brethren how can you apply it all over in the layout of CNH you can't that's still Gentiles they're sleeping through every one of these ages look waiting on the manifestation of the sons of God what brother Dale read or in Hebrews 11 they're waiting on us this whole 7 church age is the way don't us to come to place and we which are alive the little remaining bunch over here alive some of you may be asleep but alive breathing there you go maybe Lewis you don't have to interpret all that okay the brothers smiling back here so he understands what he said I'm not except a couple of things out with them remain alive until the coming of the Lord will not hinder those which are asleep for the trumpet of God shall sound and the dead in Christ shall rise first and we shall be caught up together with them Amen with them here we are meeting right here and I look on your chart he's got the rapture taking place right here all this going up alright so he's still on his chart to go to meet the Lord in the air a man and there you are where we at here it is right here where we at they wouldn't say that in Minnesota where are we at where are we at right here where did the Messiah get cut off exactly where the word said where will that 70th week begin exactly after this church is cut off right here that's me and you then God returns to the Jews to fulfill that last week don't you remember as soon as the church goes the church goes in the Jews take hold come in but first the next thing in order is not a mighty nation on a national revival amongst the Gentiles the next thing in order is the coming of the kingdom of God the coming of Christ that's what we're looking for right now that's what you and I are looking for but don't let anybody fool you to fulfil listen to me one more time everybody get ready to have taken communion put that in the study so we'll have that you wanna do it you want me to fulfill all of Daniels 70 weeks to fulfill 490 years that God has promised to deal with the Jews to take them out take them up and to build the temple there's one week left to fulfill that there is not three and a half years left yes there is three and a half years left of the 1260 days for the Jews to be saved if I got that there is not seven years of tribulation I want you to understand that we're not preaching seven years tribulation there's only three and a half years of tribulation but that has nothing to do with Daniel 70 weeks Daniel 70 weeks is 490 years period we've already lived 483 everyone was back at Christ and back further know what's left is one more week I'm not saying there's seven years left of tribulation I'm not saying there's seven years of Jesus's ministry left there's only twelve hundred and sixty days of Jesus's ministry but to finish Daniels 70 weeks there has to be one week left after the rapture of the church has to be according to the Bible according to the prophets message now what I'll do the next time I speak I'm going to bring you those quotes that you think are some of you think it's contrary to everything I preached but you think brother Branham was that confused do you really you better not then you've made him a false prophet just like the people that leave the message you've got the same spirit they do you just ain't got enough sense to leave I mean really if you think brother Branham was wrong you need to go find something else I need to go find something else but I know he ain't wrong brother RT I know he's not what a mighty God we serve I know he's not wrong no wait was he wrong you saw no it looks like he counted it he never he did not contradict yourself he said exactly what he meant and meant what he said but he cannot one more time let's stand our feet and whoever's doing the communion come on there's one week left after the rapture of the church according to the Bible and according to the prophets message I don't need anybody else's commentary even you look back at the chart that Clarence Larkin drew it's exactly that same chart that brother Branham drew now you say well Clarence Larkin was this and any other you know what do you believe Dwight Moody was a was a fake you believe Dwight Moody was a child of God brother branham said he sent millions to heaven oh he had to have some kind of ministry but he was a trinitarian he believed in the eternal hell there was a lot of different things doctrines he believed but like what I'm the point I'm making Clarence Larkin drew the same chart brother Branham could have looked at it and that was fine but brother Branham needed a revelation that went beyond Clarence Larkin Clarence Larkin may have been a good preacher he may have been a good teacher but he wasn't the Prophet to take the loose ends and straighten the loose ends out now that's the one I want to hear and that's good to hear these other people but it's wonderful to hear the man that took the loose ends and put them all back together again so don't tell me brother branham was robbing if he was wrong he corrected it right I've never heard him correct dangle 70 weeks I've never heard him say the chart was wrong I've never heard him say that what I preached was wrong so let's just leave it at that all right god bless you let's go write it in the communion if you want to be prayed for it's when in brothers hands you the communion bread and the wine I've seen people we've seen people healed by taking communion why you're believing that you're not communing with those you're not coming with me you're communing with God all right you're not communing with a human being you're communicating with God or communing with God when you're taking the communion you ought to just forget all the other things like I told the kids yesterday forget all the if your friend don't raise his hand don't feel don't be have a complex that you're not gonna raise yours if you got that feeling you raise your hand if you have a if you have an unction from God do it amen here we go in first corinthians see it took a prophet this right here proves my point it took a prophet in the first church age to straighten up everything and get everything right because paul was not in the upper room when this was instituted in 80 59 Paul wasn't even a convert of Christ he was actually the one they feared because they had the door locks because they were persecuting the Christians Paul was and then but then you say well like brother Dale says Peter and James John they were all in this upper room but not one of them spoke of the communion to Institute it what's this Ernie says for I have received of the Lord Paul got it straight from God just like brother Branham got it straight from God there was nobody in between if you think you can correct brother Branham you have inserted yourself in between God and a prophet and usually that might make you an antichrist okay but you can't have two over here and one over here it's got to be God in you all right let's read this let's read the scripture god bless you thank you for for taking time and I know some of its just dates and times and different things but to me I saw the continuity of what God was doing continuity all the way through and then we had a man stand in this endtime that told us the whole plan the whole thing what a privileged people we are what a mighty God we do serve I'm not trying to be sacrilegious but I love when she says that it just makes chills going my spine because what a mighty God we do serve I wouldn't want to serve another one for I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you in other words he received it from the Lord and he's fixing to tell us in 1st Corinthians he's fixing to tell us what happened in the upper room that he wasn't even there God showed him a vision of what went on and then give him a revelation of when Jesus said eat my flesh and drink my blood all right that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread this would be I would say this is gonna be thirsty afternoon and when he had given thanks he brake it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this doing remembrance of me after the same manner also he took the cup and when he had supped saying this cup is the New Testament in my blood this do ye as oft as you drink it in remembrance of me for as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup you do show the Lord's death till he come wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord but let a man examine himself sees you you think right there mo we're all guilty we can't take it watch what Paul says but let a man examine himself let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that Cup for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh damnation to himself not discerning the Lord's body now who is the law body not him up there the physical witness right here alright for this cause many are weak and sickly among you and many sleep for if we would judge ourselves we should not be judged but when we are judged we are chastened of the Lord that we should not be condemned with the world kind of saddens me that I've told you before some of you weren't here I was listening to a Christian radio station and they were making light that everything was made out of pumpkin spice in November and that you know last year there was toilet paper and all these different things made out of pumpkin spice and one of the somebody called in and said well our church has found where we can get pumpkin spice communion bread that's almost blasphemous now pumpkin spice communion bread just because that they don't count it they don't count it like we do this is unleavened bread made with holy hands there's nothing good about it it's just going to be something we partake of but see that's what the world has went to pumpkin spice communion bread heaven helpful where for my brother and when you come together to eat tarry one for another and if any man hunger let him eat at home that you come not together unto condemnation and the rest while I sit in order when I come
