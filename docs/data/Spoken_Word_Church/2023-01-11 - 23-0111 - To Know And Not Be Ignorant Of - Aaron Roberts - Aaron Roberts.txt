brother Bob the ones that'll be traveling Lord Lord just continue to keep your hand upon them bless the services Lord bless your bride around the world commit all things to you in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen Romans chapter 3 beginning of verse 9. it says now we know that what things so ever the law will saith it's saith to them that are under the law that every mouth may be stopped and all the world may become guilty before God therefore by the Deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight for by the law is the knowledge of sin but now the righteousness of God but the righteous god without the law is manifested being witnessed by the law and the prophets even the righteousness of God which is by faith of Jesus Christ upon all unto all and upon all them that believe for there is no difference for all have sinned and come short of the glory of God being justified freely by his grace through the Redemption that is in Christ Jesus who God set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are passed through the forbearance of God to declare I say at this time his righteousness that he might be just in the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus and then chapter First Corinthians chapter 10 . it's on the screen he says moreover Brethren I would not have ye that ye should be ignorant how that all our fathers were under the cloud and all passed through the sea and were all baptized unto Moses in the cloud and in the sea and did all eat the same spiritual meat and did all drink the same spiritual drink and they drink of that spiritual rock that followed them and that rock was Christ but with many of them God was not well pleased for they were overthrown in the wilderness amen God bless you tonight you have your seats and I I titled this to know and not be ignorant of and uh I took these two passages scripture because Romans 3 he says and we know we know that whatso that what things so ever the law saith it is to them that under law that every mouth may be stopped in all the world may be guilty before God and then here it says I would not have you ignorant and so I was I've kind of looked at this a little bit at different times and just I I you know it's interesting when you read the scripture and when you start to get into the scripture and how different writers and mainly this is the Apostle Paul but you get into some of the things that Apostle John says and Peter says it sometimes but uh the way they they word the way it's worded it's always it always stands out to me a little bit and so uh I just want to kind of look at at some of this tonight but um when it when it talks about here in the in the scripture and it gives a lot of places where Paul says we know and you know sometimes when you look at you think really we know and it's interesting when you start to read some of the scriptures that Paul says that we know and then when you look at some of the scriptures that uh when he says we shouldn't be ignorant of these things and when you begin to look at at some of these they're they're quite interesting and uh most of the time people kind of they don't quote all of this scripture but they only quote part of this scripture and it's Romans 8 28 and and Paul says he says and we know that all things work together for good most people just say all things work together for the good well Paul says we know this who are they called according to his purpose because we know this why because the spirit that's inside of us is speaking to us and uh makes an assurance to us so that's why he says this is this is Assurance to us that it the spirit is making Assurance to us reveals to this that it all works out because that's that's the way that's the way the the law of God works he said we all it all works out to the good but first Thessalonians and most of the time if you ask people said if you ask them these are the two scriptures if you said um where the Bible says we know most people quote Romans 8 28 because that's where it says we know most people think of that and if you ask somebody where would where does it say we're not supposed to be ignorant of anything and most of the time most people will quote first Thessalonians 4 13. they said I would not have ignorant Brethren concerning them that are asleep that we you saw or not even as other which have no hope so when Paul looks at this and he's saying well these are things that we should know and these are things that we shouldn't be ignorant of and so when you when you begin to look at some of these uh different scriptures here where he talks about these things and you know we understand that and we'll look at some of these scriptures but you know I always always take comfort in this and always and I really like the way that it's written because you know it didn't say that we wouldn't have sorrow we wouldn't have stress we wouldn't have problems but you know what there's a you know The Human Condition the the human person your emotions you're going you're going to have sorrow you're going to have pain you're going to have grief but he said don't sorrow like those sorrow you know we're only separated from our loved ones for a short period of time sometimes it feels like sometimes it feels like an eternity but really when you look at it you know we're only separated them for just a short period of time and when when you realize you know they've gone on and you know those that have passed on they're in a they're in a better place than we are you know you think about you know all of all of how wonderful it is to be a past on and and to be in that place and you know they don't have to deal with all the things that we have to and we're we're left here but you know what it's it's us that we can have comfort because we know where they're at and you know what it won't be long they will be changing this we'll be leaving this uh past house it'll be it'll be a change because we're gonna they're gonna one of these days we're gonna meet them they're going to be coming back to meet us here and it's not going to be long and so you know we have comfort in that just because they're they're not they're gone from our site but you know what they're they're us with Jesus they're in the presence of God now but you know there's coming a time they're going to come back and we're going to have fellowship and so we know it's not that long so we don't have to worry because you know what there's people that you know when they gone they don't have anything beyond this realm they don't have anything beyond this like this is it when when they leave here there there's there is no there is no peace there's not this is the best life they're ever going to live when they when they leave here this is this is the best they've ever had but thank God there is a way made that that for us that have that have received the eternal life of when we receive what God has given us if we receive the grace of God you know what we haven't even begun to understand what God has for us we haven't even begun to scratch the surface of what God has for us or what lays ahead of us because you know he said that eyes can has not seen or ear heard neither has it entered into the heart of man so we don't know how good it's going to be but it's going to it's wonderful it's glorious and you know that's why that's what I'm looking forward to because I believe it won't be long now here I just want to uh I got a few scriptures here that I I put down and you know just show you a few of the scriptures and I just want to read these right quick but um where where Paul talks about and uh I think we got John also in here and but uh where he talks about using just the phrase We Know and uh Brett says Romans 7 14 says for we know that the law was spiritual but I am carnal sold under sin Romans 8 22 says for we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaaleth and pain together until now First Corinthians 8 1 says now it's touching things unto Idols we know that we all have knowledge knowledge puffeth up but charityth edify First Corinthians 8 4 says as concerning therefore the eating of those things which are offered in sacrifice unto Idols we know that an idol is nothing in the world and that there is nothing but other there's none other God but one and then First Corinthians 13 9 says for we know in part and we prophesy in part and second Corinthians 5 1 says for we know that if our Earthly house or this Tabernacle were dissolved we have a building of God and house not made with hands Eternal in the heavens and then First Corinthians I mean sorry first Timothy 8 1 says but we know that the law is good if a man used it lawfully and then the Apostle John in first John says 3 3 14 says we know that we have passed from Death unto life because we have loved the Brethren he that loveth not his brother abideth in death so just just a few scriptures I wanted to read that shows you where where he says we know we know we know and then also if we're if they'll scroll up then here's just a few that that Paul talks about about not being ignorant and it says for I would not Brethren that ye should be ignorant of this mystery unless you should be wise in your own conceit that blindness in part is happened to Israel until the fullness of the Gentiles be come in and he says First Corinthians 12 1 says I'm concerning spiritual gifts Brethren I would not have you ignorant second Corinthians 8 1 says but we would not Brethren have you ignorant of our trouble which came to us in Asia that we were pressed out of measure above strength and so much that we despair even of life and then second Peter 8 3 8 says but beloved be not ignorant of this one thing that one day with the Lord is a thousand years and a thousand years as one day so I just wanted to read that to you there's just a few scriptures that I had where Paul was and the scripture talks about knowing and to not be ignorant of and so there's you know there's you could spend a lot of time looking at each one of them and but I just wanted to look at a thought tonight and uh just look at a few things that that the prophet had to say but just to know that you know these are things that we know to know these things and not be ignorant of and you know Peter said you know he said stir up that he wanted to stir up your pure mind in a way of remembrance of these things not that you know not that you've heard these things before but it's good to go back home and just stir your mind and look at these things and realize who you are and just take a look at what the scripture has them you know many times when uh when you look at the word no and you know many times when people say you you know and when you're looking at things and if you have children you'll hear that a lot especially as they get to become teenagers you know because they always I know I know and you can tell them one thing and they know they know the problem is is they don't follow what you tell them but they know and they're real quick they say I'm not I know I know I know and he's like don't go outside don't do this don't make sure you do this take that with you I know I know and then there's all of a sudden uh they can't find their fault they can't find their shoes thank you for their homework and if you tell them go put that away put that up I know I know I know but they don't I said I already a story there was something about this this mom she started charging her family five dollars every time they had her look for something that was lost because she kept trying to tell him all the time about putting away their things and taking care of things and you know she got tired of you know trying to instruct them on what to do the next thing you know they're coming Mama where's my shoes what Mama wears this where's that so she started charging him five dollars after two years she bought her a new car well because people were telling them well I know I know well it it behooves us not to just be hearers of the word but uh but it's important to be doers of the word to be made to follow the word not just to know the word because you can know the word but the word just understanding the word just having mental knowledge of something doesn't help you but it's got to be something that takes place on the inside it's got to be something that we do and I was thinking and I I believe it was brother Dale many years ago he preached a message called I know and you know he started out just real simple saying I know and you know I know that the Bible is true I know Jesus loves me but then you know what it just started growing from there I know I know I know I know as as you come up through the statue of a perfect man I know what the new birth is and it just becomes I know what the seals are you just begin to climb through the scripture you start out I know you start out just at the bottom but you know as you go I know I don't you know I don't know if anybody else knows that and you may have confusion about it but this is something I know I know I walk this I've experienced this so this is mine I've had this experience I can tell you I know this I know this for a fact and that's one of the time sometimes when we go through things and we wonder where God's letting us know you know many times we go through we struggle with things with with you know problems and and diseases and situations like well I don't know if I can make it it's like well I don't see a way out what God wants you to know that there is a way out the thing is is you you can't say well I don't know I know well they say that when they don't look like there's a way inside I don't know what way should I go I know the way Jesus said I am the way so when I'm looking for a way that I'm trying to the problem is sometimes I'm trying to figure it out myself but the problem is is I don't go to the one that's got the answer so when I when I'm trying to figure it out myself I'm lacking because I don't know but he does so if I say well Lord I'm just gonna I'm just going to wait on you because they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength so he's the one that has the way he he is the way he has the answer so that's what I'm gonna wait on him so if I just wait oh the Lord I'm just going to ask you I'm just gonna I'm just gonna lay this I'm gonna put my trust in you I'm just going to wait on you to give me an answer because if I try to I get frustrated I get worried and all these things but you know I have not put my trust in you but if we know that we can just wait on him and put our confidence in him wait on him he has the answer so he did you know because many times he didn't say that he was going to you know it's not always it's not always going to be a Divine Healing it's not always going to be miracles as but you know what if you wait on him because by his stripes we're already healed so before I ever got sick I was already healed so you know he was already the Healer before I ever got sick you know because the devil was already defeated before we ever got started but we don't see it that way because you know when you have when you have children when they're little then they they come to you know I remember when when especially Levi you know dad's a fixer I worked I worked at Chuck E cheese and I worked on machines and I was a fixer I got in maintenance and I was a fixer man I could hang everything from the Moon and just whatever it didn't matter I could fix it because I was a fixer had all the confidence in the world in me I work on stuff we got pictures of him he was trying I was working on a vacuum cleaner at the house he's in there trying to help me had a screwdriver man he was going to get in and work on that thing but he had confidence in me just simple childlike faith and you know that's all it takes that's all God is looking for simple childlike Faith just like that just that simple if we can just have that kind of confidence in him okay and here in the in the scripture when Paul's when Paul's speaking here of the scriptures we were reading tonight would get into even a few more scriptures tonight but when we begin to look here at the look at the children of Israel in their and their Journey as they were passing through and all the things that they had to face when all the things they had went through this is from the this is from the message from that time and brother Bram says and I was thinking of the assurance of our going over he said and then we noticed that one time God's children were slaves down in Egypt they throwed them bread moldy rotten whatever it was they had to eat it they ravished their girls they killed their sons anything they would and then was the people of God that's right now and so they were slaves and they could not help it but one day coming down out of the Wilderness come a prophet with a pill or fire over him and he told them the word of God that there was a land flowing with milk and honey that God had promised Abraham he'd take his children to and his promise was a Vindicated of being of God by the signs and wonders that he did while he was in Egypt and the people believed this man and he come out of Egypt the children of Israel did and came to the place of kadus Borneo which any scholar knows that Candice Barney at one time was the Judgment seat of the world that's where Israel met her judgment when she failed to believe the sign and they brought back the grapes and things from the land and he says now remember nobody had ever been in this land in their group they had heard of it Faith cometh by hearing and God made the promise you get it God made the promise and here comes Moses The Runaway prophet in there with Vindicated signs and proving that it was God taking them to this land that they'd never seen what a perfect type of today none of us has ever been over notice when they come to catus Barney of the the Judgment seat they had a great warrior among them named Joshua which means Jehovah's savior Joshua when he crossed over Jordan into that promised land and he returned back with the evidence that it was a good land he had grapes two men packed a bunch they could taste the Heavenly things from over in the promised land the good land flowing with milk and honey then come back to prove that the land was truth that God's word was exactly what Moses had said it was through the inspiration of God it was there foreign then continuing on scroll up just a little bit he says and they could have their own houses they could have their own homes documents of course they had to fight every inch of the road they took God told Joshua Joshua that whatever everywhere The Souls of your feet sits that's possession that's the way it is today everywhere the soles of your feet sit it's possession just keep walking Footprints means possession just take it and remember they had to fight every inch of the way some people can just take the two-handed sword and fight just a little bit of Shadow away some can cut through to Divine Healing every promise of God with it that's right the word is a sword that takes Faith to yield that sword that's right faith in the promised word now we notice that when they come back and they said that they could have their homes and so forth Israel crossed over into the promised land Built Homes raised children lived in peace and all the rest of the Nations respected them what a wonderful thing so when we talk about the the children of Israel and their and their Journey you know when God told Abraham that he said you know you're going to your descendants are going to sojourn in a Strange Land you have all this that you're going to have to go through but I've got a place for you we're going on a journey and when when the scriptures that we were reading that Paul was talking about you know when when he began to look at the the journey that the children of Israel had been on and the promise that was made the promise was made long before they ever some of those children never were born didn't even ever see Abraham didn't know anything about them except what they were been told but they told them there was a land that he had been promised that his four their forefather had walked his feet Abraham's Footprints were Laden laid in Canaan and he said you know what he promised that to us that was my promise that was somebody else's promise that was my promise he promised it to me but the problem was he said they stepped down there and they got stuck in Egypt and as they said in Egypt they their their mindset was just Egypt all they saw was Egypt that all they all like all I looked is brother I'm talking about they were down there and all they were under their task Masters and all they could say was Egypt and you know all they could say was all the bondage and and all the destruction and death and all this kind the misery that laid there that's all they saw they never saw anything else but as but in all that God's trying to reach them and tell them you know what you've got to land you've got a promise you've got to get up and go but you know when they got tired of being in Egypt now they didn't just sit down there and moan and groan because God come to Moses and began to speak to tell Moses he said I've heard to cry of my people by the reason of their task Masters so when they got to the place where they got tired of being down there and tired of going through all the things they've been through then they began to cry out to God because they realized you know what I've got a promise greater than this this is not my place to be this ain't what God promised me God promised me something greater than this and that's what I want amen I don't have to I don't have to be a Slave I might be a slave today but there's a day coming I don't have to be a Slave amen and so when they come to that place when the god when they begin to crowd then God sent the deliverer to them and guess what they sent a deliverer God sent a deliverer to them that had problems you know because everybody's like well you know everybody wants somebody that's that's you know everything's so right and so perfect and so pure but you know what you're not gonna find a human like that you know God's going to work through to you human Frailty and guess what if we look at everybody everybody's got faults everybody's got failures everybody's got problems right but you know what when you realize that it's not it's not the flash that you're looking at God don't want us looking at flesh we're not leaning on flesh but you know what it's God has come inside a flesh and that's what we're looking at God is inside a flesh God God is tabernacled in flesh and that's what he's using to to reach the people that's what he's using to speak that's what he's using to minister through and so you know and ever you know when we look at people everybody wants to know what kind of ministry when everybody looks well you know it's just the preachers or or you know no it's not everybody has a Ministry if you're part of the body of Christ you know what because you have a part to play in the in the body you're part of the ministry and everybody you know because you know I don't know what to do you know what you're you are to be an example to the world there's you know brother Mike said what can you do he said what are the two things that get closer to God he said read your Bible and pray well you know what if you want if you want to be a a benefit to people if you want to minister to somebody then pray right and if you got nobody else to pray then you pray twice for me but you know what if you can pray then you know what God God can work relaxed man you know what you know it does it does it doesn't it doesn't take a lot of intelligence you know because you know what the scripture tells us that you know if we have because when we don't know what to pray the scripture says that the spirit will speak with groaning so cannot be uttered so you know what when you when because when you know how many times have you begin to pray and you and you don't even know what to pray and all of a sudden the words become to come through your mouth and sometimes you will be amazed at what you're praying and you begin to pray over a situation and you're saying words to over a situation and you don't even know it's like why was I praying that and somebody comes back and says you said well you spoke exactly what needed to be said why because it's not you speaking but when we can yield to the Holy Spirit then the Holy Spirit can speak through us because he knows what needs to be said you know I tell everybody the worst the worst thing the worst mistake I ever made or one of the worst mistakes I ever made in my life that I still think about I I still to this day it bothers me brother Harold Hildebrandt came in and he preached in in Ruth North Carolina all week and he come preach Sunday here and he was sitting right over here and I was sitting we were standing right beside him and his his voice was gone that Sunday morning he could just barely whisper and the Lord kept telling me to lay my hands on him and he kept telling me you need to get just just and it's like get the brothers to pray he always need to pray over him his voice is gone and it was so it was so strong and you know I just I fought that and I fought that I felt that and it's like why because you know we sometimes we don't think we don't think we're worthy enough we don't think we ought to be doing that well if the Lord's gonna speak why did Brother why didn't brother Dale have the the why didn't the Lord speak to brother Dale to do that because you know what sometimes God's going to speak to you to see what you will do because everybody thinks well you know what it's got to be brother Dale or brother Wade or brother Bob because if it's not one of them or brother Terence you know then then you know it's we we can't we can't wait on somebody else to do it but Joe I I I got a quote in here I want to read later you know what brother I'm talking about having Divine Healing and taking place you know he said you know everybody's waiting on on the Evangelist to come he says you know he doesn't take the Evangelist prayer it's anybody's prayer but you know everybody's waiting on somebody and you know and I I never did I never did pray for brother Hildebrandt when he was standing here and you know that's that's bothered me for years and you know when he come out to preach the second service you know he could hardly he was even worse than he was that morning he just barely whispered I I was I was hey I've said it just felt like this great weight was sitting on me I was so I was under such condemnation and it's like you know what if that ever happens to me again I'm I'm not doing this again I may be wrong but you know if I feel if I feel led to do something I may be out of line but you know I would I would much rather do something because brother Randall said you know if you have the the desire to do something or you have the call to do something he said check it by the word well then you know what then it's our it's our responsibility as a body not well you know it's me you know I'm not like everybody else see we we get and it's good to be humble but sometimes people try to get so humble that we get out of our position we get out of our place that's not where God wants us to be right yeah we can be we're late we're at least in the body we say well I'm the least in the Kingdom as Paul said but you know what that doesn't mean that God can't speak to us and use us if we get to the place and we get so and we get so humble that we that we're useless that God's not going to speak no we shouldn't think higher than we that we are but we shouldn't get to the place where God's not well I can't the God can't use me because you know that that's not part of the body that's not benefit to anybody but you know when I got to that place you know I thought you know Lord if if something comes to me I I never get away from I I just have to and brother after brother Danny Fountain had his accident I was sitting back here and the Lord began to it just same it was just all I pray for brother Dane he was I think he was sitting over here in a chair and I called all the brothers said we got to pray for today I don't know why I don't know why but we we just all got together over here and prayed over him and you know anytime the Lord just deals with me in a way like that you know it's like you know we don't want to speak to people or we see people coming down the street or or certain situations you know if if the Lord begins to deal with me he's like Lord you know either either stop me because I I just I just feel so impressed to do stuff but he said he said those that are sons of God are led by the spirit of God but sometimes we don't want to we we we get to the place that we you know we're feel like that we're So Unworthy that we can't be used of God that God can't speak to me to do you know it's like well you know somebody else said no sometimes God uses us God's going to speak to you to speak to somebody it's not always it's not always the preachers foreign but you know when when God Called Moses to go down there and be a deliverer we know that you know Moses he had his faults and he had his failures here's a man that was the second highest man there in all of Egypt this great leader in Egypt but you know God told him he said that's not your position you know through his mom told him he said listen that's not you're not you're not one of them that's not who you are you're a deliverer you're a Hebrew God didn't call you to sit on the throne in Egypt brother Brown said that you know it took all those years of him having all of that education and all of that learning all of that that he went through in Egypt had 40 Years of all that great knowledge and all that beat in you know taught into him learned all that stuff and then it took 40 years to get it out of him and why because those 40 years that he was there to see and understand how all that was the great great nation the great Empire of Egypt and had everything at his fingertips and then the next thing you know he's a nobody in the desert watching over sheep nobody knew he was there and nobody cared but you know that's where God wanted him why because it molded Moses into who he was and when when he got to the place where God wanted him to be after all that he had been through and all things that he had seen and all that he had suffered then guess what God had a supernatural event for him met him in a burning bush and began to speak to him he said you know what you you know what you were called to be you're called to be a deliverer that's your job that's what your calling is that's what and now it's time for you to go forth and in the in the midst of of him calling him and telling Moses this is what God God's called you to this and he's like oh I I can't do this I can't speak I don't I don't I don't have you know I'm So Unworthy it can't be me and what God do God began to tell him listen you are the one that's going to deliver these people and I'm going to be with you and I'm going to give you two signs to show the people that you're gonna that you're gonna be the one and you're not going alone but you're going to have a mouthpiece you're going to have a prophet go with you and that's your brother you're going down there but you know you're going to be the one that's going to stand before pharaoh and telling the the days of my people being in bondage are over with you're going to go in front of and tell them let my people go he's like oh no I'm not going to let him go but you know all the things that that Moses went through you know God was with him and God led him all the way through all of that and God was leading him and dealing with him the whole time and told him said listen I'm going to harden Pharaoh's heart and he's not going to let y'all go but you know what you're still going to go down there and tell him let my people go but don't worry because you know what in the end it's going to happen now here he has to go down there and the greatest and the greatest nation in the world and the greatest Empire of all the whole world and he's got to go down there after living 40 years on the backside of the desert dealing with sheep he didn't look like nobody nobody wanted to see but you know what it wasn't the position that he was in it's the God that he had it's the God that he served his God made God made a way for him he went before pharaoh and told her he said you're gonna let my people go but we don't understand that when all that took place and God put him in the right position to be there why because it was going to tear down all of Egypt because he said well guess what you don't want to let him go that's fine guess what we got to wait take care of this we've got we've got these plaques and each one of these plagues are going to attack each one of your Gods your deities we're going to tear them all down and everything that went forth every time that Moses was doing something he was showing that God was the one in control he was the one that was leading all this not anything that the Pharaoh had or anything that Egypt had and it began to show the people that were there he began to show the children of Israel that you know what God had a way for them that God after after you sing all of that and living all of that that Egypt had and all the gods and and everything then you know what all of a sudden when Moses come and said you know what that's fine he said we're just going to turn all the waters to blood the Mighty the Mighty the mighty Nile River and all these things and began to see how each one of those the Flies and the fleas and the frogs and the Darkness all these things that took place each one of those things that came to them was showing that their gods didn't have any control over that right but Moses began to tell the people look this is the same God that's leading you out look at this miracle that's took in place look what took place here well look what take place here and all the way as it goes along God doing the work before them showing and he's the one that's going to lead you out and it just kept taking place and kept taking place but you know then finally when they got to the place then God told them that now it's the time after the after the death of the firstborn now it's time to go get ready when they began to see all these things it's like yeah I I can see now's the time to get ready and to go we gotta we got to follow the word of Moses we got we've got to get our shoes on we got to get our staff we got to get ready Now's the Time to get out and when they when they got out and to leave and they began to eat the lamb and take the blood and put it on the doorposts and all those things and get ready to go after they'd seen all those Miracles take place and God had brought them that far and brought him into the to a place to get out the and they seen all that all the Miracles that had taken place and then they began to walk out it's it's a mind-blowing situation because before that they were down there and they saw no way it was totally hopeless that was absolutely nothing that was going to take them out of that why because they were so in the in the in had that all ingrained in them all about Egypt how wonderful How Great and Mighty Egypt was until God come began to deal with them and show them what what he had done they had they they went from absolutely doing nothing moving in no Direction until God began to speak to him and you know what they got ready to walk out God began to do do something that they would you know what I'm ready to go I'm eating this with lamb and I'm getting out of here and two and a half million people began to get up and walk out and you know it's in America when you when you think about it that's a what a what a mind-blowing miracle that was that they got together and left if you if you've been under such bondage for so long and you never had anything to yourself but now there's a way made and you're actually leaving the bondage you're actually walking out I mean what a mind-blowing experience to realize you know after I've lived in this my my dad's been in this bondage my grandparents been in this bondage and now I'm walking out after 400 years of my ancestors being down here I'm leaving and I'm walking out to say What miracles took place for me to have that happen to me when that happened and I began to walk out then then when the when Pharaoh's Army began to chase them then all of a sudden they were paralyzed with fear they were back in a bondage again because now oh no here they come why because God wanted real you know what I've did I've defeated them all the way up till now they've been defeated every single time and there's Moses crying to God but what do you want him to see there's another great Victory ahead of you right here it is now you're coming up he said he said this this Army this this enemy that you see your oppression all all of this that you've been through all the way up till now he said this he said this Army that you see he said you'll never see him again but you know what they had to get to the place where God could lead them to the place that they got when they got to the place where God wanted them to get to then when Moses is down there crying he said why are you crying to me Moses he said speak the word and go forward did he give Moses they give Moses the words to speak and the Y and the Red Sea opened he knew which way to go because God was leading him it wasn't Moses playing it wasn't Moses intelligence it was the plan of God God was leading him and he began to speak the waters opened and here they are walking on dry ground here they are walking across on dry two and a half million people when you step out there every single day then you see this Mighty River that Chicago probably couldn't hardly see all the way across it it's great see all this water everywhere no telling how deep it was when you when you come to this then you see it all of a sudden the water's parked and you see these giant walls of water on each side of you and I'm sure it wasn't no and what I'm sure it wasn't no 36 inch wide path that they were walking so here here it is this great expanse has opened up in front of them and it's dry all the way across this Supernatural is happening in front of them and here they are walking all this way in front on this dry ground Supernatural happening everywhere they're seeing this great happening here they are going out and they're worried about the Army that's coming behind them but the word is already told them listen don't you worry about him coming behind you that's not a problem he said because you'll never see them anymore after today right why because they were because God called the children of Israel to go one way and they the Egyptian Army wasn't designed to go that way God didn't call them to go that way but they started to try to go the exact same way and when they got to the right place and guess what God pulled his hands back the waters come back and washed them all away and drowned them and here they are all destroyed and then all of a sudden you know now now they're over there tambourines and clapping and everybody's so happy but you know what all that rejoicing they come all that way and they're rejoicing with short-lived because the next time they had a bump in the road next time they had a little bit of problems everything every time every little discomfort that they had they stopped and had to complain well I don't like this and I don't like that we don't have any water and you're out here trying to kill us when the whole time he God's trying to tell him listen I got you a place and I'm trying to take you there and you know what all The Supernaturals happened all the way in front of you to show you that I'm right here leading you but they've missed they've missed the supernatural and don't believe that God is actually trying to move them and lead them to the place but God was faithful all the way in everywhere that he went leading them and show him that he was in charge that he was leading them but they didn't have faith to believe after all that they had seen after all that they had heard as they were leaving they still complaining still have you know oh we could just go back who wants to go back all right no there's something greater when you got two and a half million people marching along and all of a sudden you got you got all you know all of these are complaining and you only got two that come out of all of that two that come out of all of that and you know they had their minds set on what God had promised them here was two and a half million people coming out seeing the supernatural God lead them all the way and when they when they murmured and complained you know what God forgave and said come on let's go give them what they had need of fed them took care of them never got sick never got old never had problems God taken care of them the whole way but they never could they never could get to the place to realize you know God's leading me and I have confidence in that you know I'm going into that land when they got to kadish Barney and told them it's time to go you know they they couldn't fight even after when he brought the evidence back and showed them what was in the land when the when the spies gave the report and told them listen that's exactly the way it is in the in the land just like the way he said it was and you got you got 10 people that have walked through that land ten spies those 10 Witnesses when they went through that land and said hey it's exactly what he said but you know what we are we are not strong enough to take them I know I know that I know that God was the one that that brought us out of Egypt when we when we were in bondage and and all we never had anything and all the problems that we had down there and we walked up there to the Red Sea and it parted and you know and all the things and we seen the water come out of the rock and all these things that we've seen and witnessed but you know what God's not God's not we're not able to what it wasn't them that got that far all right it wasn't God it was God it had led them that far and everything that they had God was the one that brought them that far it wasn't them right right but you here's here the children of Israel when they get there but there was two so hey when they begin to the crowd we can't we can't we're we're so small you know and we look like grasshoppers in their sight it's it's so bad it's so bad and here's here's Joshua and Caleb trying to steal the people trying to get the hysteria down so they can tell them say listen this is what God Said God brought us this far and he's going to carry us all the way and then whatever you have need of God will meet your need because God gave it to us now the only thing that we got to do is go forward that's all we got to do we got to go forward and walk in it because you know what the battle's not mine it's his why because he's the one that promised it to us but you know what they they couldn't they couldn't accept what God had done for them but you got to you but you got to walk forward you got to take what God Said and move forward now this is this is from the message the True Vine and faults Vine and brother Brown is is speaking to a to a lady in the in the in the prayer line and he says he said what do you think sister he said Do you believe with all your heart he said all right if you believe it's for you he said God honors Believers isn't that right but to him that believeth if I didn't say one thing to you and laid hands on you do you believe you'd be healed anyhow don't you see I like that kind of Faith have faith in God and we'll go to the next quote there and and and so here's here's brother Brandon he's speaking of people this is from the second hand rope and you know he's speaking of people and you know they're they're going to you know when brother talks about them going to a witch because they had faith in her that when they went to her that they could get healed and he says but the poor people that's approaching coming they're thinking they're approaching God and God has to honor faith I don't care where it's at and they approach God through the witch they think they're coming to God coming through there and God's got to honor that faith so that's what God honors is their faith because they believe they're approaching God through that situation and that's what God was looking for he was looking for them to have faith because he brought them all that way he showed them all the evidence and he brought them all that way and showing them where they were at but they had to have faith in what God Said they had to have faith to believe what God had said and it come and showed it to him and if we could just put our faith in and understand that that we could overcome if we have faith in what God Said that's right and as you know as as the scripture we were reading you know all the things that the children of Israel had been through and all the things that they had seen because you know what the scripture says they it was not mixed with faith all the word that they'd heard was not mixed by with faith and this is from the message desperations and brother I'm talking about being overseas and and the the meetings and and everything and he and he says and he's talking he said and we gotta we got to get the seasons where it's not raining and pouring down rain and those people sitting out there I've seen people sit out there with their hair just stringing down Fine dress people and just just sit in that rain all day just sat there and it's just pouring and thundering and lightning and storms blow and them just weaving back and forth against one another like that setting right there wait till you come to pray for them see now you know God honors Faith like that he does and he says you've got to do something for God to honor see you show him the people that's got everything handed to them so easy they don't usually they they don't do nothing for it you see you've got to the gift is free that is true but you've got to it seems like that you know like they say if he was born with a silver spoon you've heard that you don't appreciate but when you have to work for it you appreciate the value of it you know and brother random was talking about one time he he was talking about being over in the in the the uh over season and in the different places and and he began to talk about uh being in the Tabernacle and he said you know it's so hot in here and you know we're so crowded and all this and he said but you know we shouldn't complain about what we have here and he told me and he said you know when you look to see what people have overseas and and he talks about you know they go out there early in the morning and they and they stay out there all day and he said you know they lean against each other and he said you know people that are sick and The Afflicted he said they stack them up just trying to hear one word from God and then here they are all leaned up against each other people that are dying and they're and they're stacking them up and and all of those situations just to hear one word just to hear one word from God Desiring because they they know here's here's the words of life this is all that's all it takes is just this one word and and he and he talks about uh that time where um he was uh and overseas somewhere and you know had the Storm come up and and you know he's sitting in his room and he was uh talking about the uh the room and he was talking about he said he said the trees look like they were falling over and you know it's so windy and rainy and stormy and thundered and lightning and and he thought well you know he said ain't nobody gonna be down there and all and all that storm nobody gonna be down there and he's like well I might as well just you know not get ready and he said next thing you know the car backs up there's a knock at the door or whatever and that man tells him said come on time to go and he's like do what he said there's people down there in that storm and that man told him he said he said you can't get within blocks of that place he said in all that storm he said yeah he said they want to hear from God right they want to hear a word from God and go through all that storm and everything and not real you know and we think we have it so good and we've had so many things happen and and been so blessed of all the things that's happened that's come our way that God has done for us and yet we don't honor that we don't respect that we don't we don't honor what God has done you know because if if we if you're sick you know the the devil wants to wants to give you a reason not to do anything and you know I I I'm just as guilty as anybody else but you I you know it just lays on me sometimes you know because it's good to have somebody come behind and say and speak to you in love and say listen don't give up sometimes we're just like him folks down in Egypt that's all we've seen we've seen the same situation over and over and over we've seen we've seen our loved ones in the same condition and ain't got any better we've seen our children out in the world and ain't got any better and sometimes it's gotten worse and worse and worse I got I I'm sick I got I got whatever and you know every time I go to the doctor it just gets worse and worse and worse I ain't any better just like it just like that woman had come had the issue a blood spent all she had she went to all kind of doctors kept going you know what she kept getting worse she didn't get any better than all she could spend all she had didn't do one or didn't do her one bit of good but you know somewhere along the way she got in her mind she said that he's the Healer and no doubt she had seen Jesus heal people and no doubt she might even known people that got healed and see what God could do and see what God had done and you know what she didn't have to read in the scripture and wonder well I wonder if I should there was something that spoke to her that rose up inside our wherever where she said where was the scripture says you touch his garments you get healed but somewhere along the way there was something that something struck her that she said if I can just touch but the Hem of His Garment she said why because he's got the healing power I don't have to have him say anything over me I don't have to have him lay his hand on me all I got to do is just Touch the Hem of His Garment and I can be ate whole and she went into that crowd and maybe that was a that was the closest she ever got to Jesus you know what she didn't run to the end of the town and hide so well maybe Jesus will come this way and I'll wait on him she didn't wait on Jesus to come past her way she knew where he was at and she was fighting her way through the crowd she was pressing her way in and she fall all the way to Jesus when everybody's bumping shoulder to shoulder she might have had to crawl he didn't stop her she knew where she was going she had she had a vision she had a goal she had a plan and she didn't stop till she got there and just barely touching just a little bit of His Garment that he never felt humanly but there was something Supernatural they took because she had Faith to do to believe and to act on that and they was like who touched me why because she she had faith in God because she had faith in who he was and what he could do so he honored that faith and God healed her and said that's the kind of faith that it takes it just takes just a simple but you've got to act on it but you know as as the as the children of Israel you know when they went all those years and and went to kadish Barney and God began to deal with them and tell them listen you could cross over you can cross over into this land you're more than conquerors to take this land it belongs to you it's always belonged to you but the question is are you going to take it and when they went there then when they wouldn't accept what God had done for them what God had made a way already for them then when they went all that way then they said listen he said your your carcasses will rot in the wilderness but then you know what after God tells them you can't go in then they want to rise oh hey we're going to take it now your time's up you're done God's judgment already fell on them you can't go any further you're done but he said your children who you thought would be a pray to them said they're going to raise up and they're going in and take that land but you know what it never it never dimmed Joshua's Vision it never damned Caleb's vision the whole time they were there you know I you can just see old Caleb out there knowing that land laid there for 40 years walking around with a bunch of grumbling complaining whiny people he walked around with them same old people over and over and had to listen to the same old complaints but I guarantee you oh oh Caleb was out somewhere and you know what he had a sword somewhere in his hand and you know what he was doing he sat there and I bet he was doing this the whole time sharpening that sword chicken that made you guys I got a good Edge on it I don't know when I'm going but I'm going I got a good Edge on that sword well it's been one two three ten years 15. might have started getting gray headed might have started losing his hair might started being a little humped over but you know what didn't hell it didn't stop him didn't hinder him every single day you know what I'm what are you 85 years old he's stood there something just as good and the day I walked through that land right I'm a witness I've been in the land because our Father Abraham walked in this land he walked in this land and and Caleb he didn't see the Giants he didn't see all the hindrances he saw the promise of God I'm walking in the land that our forefathers walked in I'm walking in what God promised me and I can just see oh it's going to be great when we get over here it's great ain't nothing like it and you know what in all those years that he went to he wasn't hindered by any of that he was happy 40 years having to put up all them crazy people over there no doubt he went out there sometimes probably see a few of them die a few thousand of them die here there well that's a few more we don't have to deal with because we're getting closer we're getting closer to going over I'm getting closer going over I'm getting better I ain't getting I'm getting older I ain't getting worse ain't getting more problems no I'm getting ready to go over I got what I what I come for I got it it's been revealed to me and I am not stopping till I get there and brothers and sisters it's the same way whatever you have need of it's the same thing because if God if God has started you on a journey Richard and I was talking about that the other day how in the world did we end up in Lula Georgia how in the world do you go from North Carolina to Tennessee all the way to Lula Georgia you know you can't you can't write this I mean you know he wrote fiction people wouldn't believe this probably but you know what it's a supernatural event sometimes we don't we don't think of it that way but you know what's the leading of the Lord has led us all this way [Applause] and God's trying to try to encourage us to realize Who We Are God's brought us this far guess what ain't done with us we're going all the way whether and you know there's so many people that's been sick and and Afflicted and and carried all these things but you know what it just serves something inside of me because you know what it it's not just them that has to pray it's our job to pray for them we're a body and you know if if we're a body and I'm not talking about just this this building and I'm just not talking about the people that come to this this congregation I'm talking about the body of Believers worldwide because you know what God thinks just as much of the people in China as he does us and whether they have anything in in Nepal or India you know what there's there's the children of God just like we are right and you know that we pray for them and they pray for us then you know what when when somebody gets sick when you know when we should we shouldn't ever never get to the place where you know we we think that you know somebody comes up here for prayer well I don't know if the Lord's going to do it or not no we we should when you come up here for prayer if you or if you speak the word then you know what then you when you speak the word then you know what then you believe that God's going to do it why because God said if you would believe and speak if you say to this mountain if you confess hold on I'm confessing what he's saying and he's the one that's got to back it up not me I don't have to do anything but believe and that's reason he said God honors Believers he's got to honor their faith why because they got their faith in and that's what they believe and they walk in it said you know what then I can I can claim my children I can claim my family why because it's the promise of God to me then you know what I've got to have faith no matter what comes what it looks like no matter how many years whatever comes or goes that doesn't matter God made the promise yes and whether whether you get sick and it just can continues to get worse or whatever that doesn't mean anything I tell everybody all the time that I think about when when brother Dick had cancer and brother brother Dick had that you know had that prostate cancer you know I just got so burdened one time and I was riding in the truck and I know y'all heard it many times but I was just riding in the truck that day and I'll never forget when I was riding in that truck and I began to pray over brother dick and the situation it's just like I couldn't get away from it and I'll never forget the day I was riding in the truck and the Lord came in there and he spoke to me and he said Lazarus was dead four days and he said brother dick's not as far as Lazarus was right and when I when I got that when I when I got that Revelation then you know what it just changed the whole thing because you know what I began to praise God for what he had done damn it for Friday why because it's a finished work it's not it's not something because you know that's what we got to have confidence in that's what we got to have faith in it's a finished work of calvary right that's the reason many times when I pray that's why I thank God why because when I pray over somebody and I say you know because by his stripes we are healed and you know what it's a finished work of calvary then if then if you have a need they know it's already finished before you ask then you don't have to struggle and plead over it why because it's already finished then all you got to do is claim your god-given rights that we don't have to we don't have to back up from the Devil the devil likes to give you a hard time and people you know well I don't know I don't know no sometimes sometimes it's time for us to raise up like shamgar go get what belongs to us and run the devil off that's what God wants us to do and if you have whatever you have need of so well Lord I don't I don't understand it's like well Lord I've read these books and I've read this and I don't understand this and I don't understand that then you know what you just put it before God and see if God don't come on the scene and show you what the scripture says because you know what brother I've said that he's no respecter of persons he don't respect one person over another because you know what if you desire these things and you put yourself before God and you seek God for these things then see if he don't open it up to you if he don't reveal to you what you're looking for because so many how many times can you say things in your life that you've seen God come on the scene and do Supernatural things and you don't know how it happened it only was God that was years ago I was working in a manufacturing plant and we were we were using robots to weld all these parts and we had jigs of hell and everything and we had these racks and they were probably near as tall as this ceiling and they were have to have racks were probably covered half of this room right here and it was just racks all these jigs in there we were looking for one jig so we get done so we go home and everybody's out there looking for that one jig and they can't find it and I didn't even know what I was looking for they just give me a part number and said go look for it and they'd already been out there looking and everybody scoured all of them people have been there for years and knew what they were looking for I didn't know what I was looking for but I had a number did I tell you I didn't know what I was looking for and I sat there and all these people all over the place looking trying to find that even looking at other places it wasn't even in the racks trying to find that one jig and I stood away and I was looking back over all those Jigs and I was standing there they began to pray and I said Lord do you know where that is I don't and Justice sure as I'm standing right here the Lord showed me and told me what direction to go I walked right up climbed up on the top and right in the middle that top of that rack was sitting right there and people had already looked for it and didn't see it and I reached up there and I picked it up and the guy come over and I handed it to him and said that's what we're looking for why because today they put their trust in him because if you are a son of God then you're led by the spirit of God then God can lead you when I went to Brother James tidwell's Church many years ago the old truck that Richard has behind his house Richard now and daddy worked on that thing well that thing never would work it we had we had ignition problems brother Donnie that thing wouldn't work we've done everything rewired it we bought new parts we done everything and it's like I don't know it was a devil in that truck and we couldn't get him out that thing was the most aggravating this thing that day I I was preaching brother James sidwell's Church that night and brother Michael his son come pick me up bring me Church because I didn't have a way so he kind of got me and I was riding in the truck to church and nothing and that's all I think about that truck oh aggravating this thing that night I got to preaching I was preaching on faith we have not because we asked not we get our minds on our problems and not have our minds on God and I'll never forget I got behind I was preaching behind the department that night and I said I got faith to believe I can go home put the key in that truck it'll crank my brother Michael's dropped me off I went behind the house and cranked that truck what would you do I said I put the king in and cranked why because God had why because he got faith and God knows that God's a mechanic sometimes he's the best mechanic he'll ever have man but it's just simple time like faith and we just trust God and walk by faith no matter what the circumstances looks like and you know what it's God's good pleasure to do that for you can you imagine that the God of all creation desires to give it to you more than you want it can you imagine foreign sometimes we we get in our minds whether we're worthy enough or not and God tries to tell us it's ours I just want to apologize and say Lord Lord help my unbelief Lord forgive me for my unbelief wait you've done so much for me and I don't have and I don't have confidence in what you've told me Lord forgive me for that because you know in the morning you know we don't know what kind of problems we're going to have but you know what he's gonna he's gonna meet at your every need it may not come the way you want it to but I guarantee you he'll meet your every need and I pray I pray that whatever you whatever you ask for tonight let's all stand whatever you ask for not have the musicians come whatever you ask for tonight I believe the Lord will give it to you right you don't have you don't have to ask and pray and grovel I was talking to somebody the brother Mark was we was talking the other day and brother Mark was telling me he said I love when you was when he was preaching on a court case and and you were talking about how when you get to the place and you know what your position in the law is when you when you go in before court that you you know the law when you petition the court you're not having to grovel in front of front of the judge all you got to do is say the law says this and here's where I've met the requirements of the law and whatever whatever the situation is on this this belongs to me and the devil's a squatter and he's on my property and the law says that I can kick him off but now when I go before the judge that's all I got to do I show the judge this is the rules this is where I've met all the requirements now it's for the judge to act and enforce the law and that's the way it is with God if you he said if you've met the same requirements as somebody if he's already healed one person you make the same requirements he's got to heal you if he said he said if he would do this for you if it's in the word is that right I love it when when Richard said I didn't know I didn't know though I didn't know brother Adam said those virtues were a requirement well you know what if they're a requirement if God requires them then guess what God has made a way for you to receive them then you know what I don't I don't have to grovel over that because you know what God said they're mine if I want them if I'm a Child of God then you know what that's required then you know what God's made a way for me to receive them then that's all it takes whatever I have whatever God has for us then we can receive it whatever we have need of and just say thank the Lord thank you Lord I'll I'm going to receive what belongs to me and just and just believe that and you know that I and it's whatever you have made up then I want to believe with you not just you because you know what nobody nobody's you know lots of times some or sometimes you you'll feel like you're all by yourself but you know what you've got so many around you that believe with you that whatever you have need of them we're going to believe for the same thing that you believe for whether you have healing a financial situation a marital situation whatever it is your children whatever it is if you believe then you know what we're going to believe with you because if it's God's word for you to have it for you to be blessed then guess what we're going to believe the same thing because you know we we live so far below our privileges what God has privileged US to have and I want to I want to be a faithful witness to what God has given us I want to be I want to be an heir and I want to be faithful to what God has done for us amen God bless you brother Joe seeing that course that require problems in the book as well amen every promise in the book is mine every chapter every verse
