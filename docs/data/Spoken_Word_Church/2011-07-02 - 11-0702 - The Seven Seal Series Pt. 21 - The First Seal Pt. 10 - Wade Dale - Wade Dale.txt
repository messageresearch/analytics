TRANSCRIPT
========================================
ready happy 4th of July 3rd of July 2 of July some of July third of July third okay third of July independence day every day should be an Independence Day for for the Christian in the world huh your numbers I know I got to hit go first now recording Revelation 6 I hope you brought some seal book we're going to read a little bit today now what we're going to do is good to have sister Francine re with it from Jamaica and her husband speaking for us today did a wonderful job last night looking forward to the day and then we'll have a good time of Fellowship afterwards all right Revelation 6 CH 1 now what we've done is we have this is number 10 I think in the first seal but it's number 20 as far as as being um in the seven seal series We are continuing on the first seal we're going to read this today we're going to read some quotes and then next Sunday what we'll do is we'll put everything all the identifications of the first seal we'll list it then we're going to go to the second seal so the second seal will be in two Sundays all right but this coming Sunday will be a recap and then we'll put down all it like it's the the U combat Beast is the lion uh we're looking at the Antichrist the Deeds of the nicians uh mystery of iniquity man of sin we've already read all that and then we'll move on to the second seal all right so at this pace we will probably be finished about Christmas but if we're still here that's okay if we're not that's okay too we'll just finish it over there we don't have to go and uh depart from each other so chapter 6 verse one and I saw when the lamb opened one of the seals and I heard it were the noise of Thunder one of the four beasts saying come and see and I saw and behold a white horse and he that sat on him had a bow and a crown was given unto him and he went forth conquering and to conquer now remember what we were talking about for the past Sundays the White Horse is the white righteous Church it had to be white because it had to be deceptive it couldn't be he couldn't start off as a black horse because you could see the separation had to start off with the White Horse Satan had to start out so close remember we read in Ezekiel we read in Isaiah we read in 2 Thessalonians that man of sin he wanted as as he was cast out as he was cast out of Heaven he's always wanted to get back into heaven well what is heaven Heaven's not a space or somewhere that's for wall Heaven brother Brown said consist of the word so he got kicked out out of the word Satan got kicked out of the word cuz that's what he's perverting he's perverting the word when he got Adam and Eve to do what they did that perverted this outside guy but God still kept Adam and Eve their soul was clean they they had the baptism of the Holy Ghost in their soul right but they did what they did with the outer man so the outer man fell Adam never fell in in his soul right that theophany never that's right that's why I don't understand these people trying to say well you're just a soul brother R spent all his whole Ministry trying to make sure that we understood that we had a body a spirit and a soul we live in three different room right we're not just a soul we're a body spirit and soul a man all right and this man Christ Jesus showed us how to live in all three but Satan took Adam's ability to be Eternal in this thing you're seeing right here not the soul right because the soul that sinth it shall die not the spirit we sin every day of our life that's right all right even bad thought even you know Dad and I were talking about even even if let's just be plain we're adults the relationship you have with your wife that's sin God allowed that to happen he allowed the bed not to be defiled but if we have any kind of thought that we're not going to have those thoughts over there right we're not going to have those thoughts over there not going to need those thoughts over there it's going to be brother R said it's going to be so much higher wow so much higher than what we love down here it's going to be he said millions times what we love you okay so we sin every day we have sinful f thoughts but that soul and that person that you are that being that come to you at the new birth that person never had a bad thought that person never sinned cuz the seed remaineth in it and it cannot sin all right but as Christians we have sins and we sin every day all right but what we got to realize is that now that that we have I think the the apostles had a great understanding of the soul of man watch Paul's writings and all those and then Peter going up the statue of a perfect man he understood that this man inside was perfect but this man outside was not so this man outside had to be brought under subjection to the one inside all right so there's where you come to where they could not take a body change because they said okay my soul is eternal they believe that held on with with good faith but they died this end time that's not what's going to happen somebody's going to take this this part of the Bible and let it become a brand new book why not become a brand new book cuz you know what as a as a born again Christian I read the Bible and boy it just opened up things to me and opened up things to me but now it's opened up more things to me all right I mean it become a brand new book like I said it didn't become a brand new chapter that's right it become a whole brand new book why because you you brother Brandon preached doors IND doors read that book sometime doors and doors he said even though you are a Christian once God's in your house you allow him to come in remember the door knobs on the inside and you let him in that's right you let him in you become a Christian you become born again he said there's still doors in your house that's right that you don't let God in that's right and he start talking about listen Pride all kind of things that you got that as a Christian what it's that right there you got you got uh to to me you've got seven doors Butz this is the door you let him in at Faith all right this is the door you let him in and this does have something to do with the first but we got to understand one thing we either are God or we're the devil right one of the two and you can be white righteous every day of your life and die and go to hell you can ride that horse right there and he'll take you right into purgatory you open the door to let God in but see you still got doors in'll shut everybody understand that you got doors that you have to open you say seven ads there's seven ads this is not an ad he said add to your faith 1 2 3 4 5 6 seven all right then it's all molded together by the holy spirit that comes and puts all this in action remember you're put insert you're put at a position for service then you're put in service you're put in service that's you birth but then you put in service for virtue you put in service for knowledge for temperance patience Godly kindness all right and the Capstone which is love not the love you have for your wife it's a love that's greater far greater than that cuz remember the Bible said in 2 Thessalonians it wasn't that they didn't hear the truth they didn't hear the love of the truth now remember we read that it wasn't it says the love of the truth is what they turn down they had the truth right people in a message church for years have the truth but do they have the love of the truth love AG love what the love of God the perfect love that brother R said all those people over on the other side had perfect love which was the baptism of the Holy Ghost in your soul the new birth because people if we don't see that that man is in there you're not going to see that opposition going any other direction that's right when that white horse rider rode out away from brother brandham and he saw that Rider go away from him he knew one thing for sure he might come back as something else but that white horse was riding away from him he said here stands the Lamb with a book in hand and there goes the white horse rider the what that white righteous church that he might have been a part of cuz he was preaching that the Holy Ghost was the was the white horse rider which was wrong he corrected himself God corrected the prophet we can't correct it all right but you saw that opposition right off you and I must see the same thing you and I must see that same writer that white righteous like brother Keith was talking about this is not a social event I don't come in here Sunday just for a social event to see y'all I come to meet God and if God's in you then I meet you God in you just try I'm s that's when it says that Satan was kicked out of heaven and Heaven consists of the word was he was he take taken from the revelation of the word that's why he's trying exactly trying to get back in he was taken away he was the anointed sherff he was the guy he was the uh vice president in other words right but when God said remember what we read it he said when iniquity was found in you I cast you out in other words that's paraphrasing that's what scripture said when we read in Ezekiel thou son of the morning you've done this you've done that you walked through the Garden of Eden pretty close to God you had God you had Adam who was what secondary God Eve who was a secondary god with Adam then you had the devil you had four pretty powerful people walking in the Garden of Eden now what happened see Adam got messed up Eve got messed up and the whole thing got messed up now what's and then what did God say he said depart in other words go away but I'll come and make this thing come back what to the original to where there wasn't where where you can you you can have love for your for your sister and it not be a love that's perverted like it is down here that's right you know with Godly love but it says I saw and behold a white horse and he that sat on him had a bow remember he was a bluff and a crown was given unto him who gave him the crown you and I gave him the crown or the people in the church ages that that believe these ideas that's why brother randam said he said he said I he said I always wondered about those denominations well he preached why am I against organized religion in 1959 4 years before the seals broke and now he's just realizing why no he had a further revelation of wine he knew it was rotten but he really didn't what he was trying to do was put it in the word right but when he put it in the word in that first seal and he saw that white righteous Church stand so close and remember we talked about John John on the aisle of pmas he admired the Bible said he admired that church he looked upon her in other words she was so beautiful he was getting so close to it right he was getting close even a born again Christian for 60 years this man admired that church because it was so beautiful now he didn't see a big steep he saw the spirit that was working in that church all right wasn't the big Steeples and the colors and the pantry and all the gold no he saw that but he admired her it said what her the system and guess what you and I can admire it and that's what we do until we're born again we're just a church we're just an organization then when we come into the body of Christ we become an organism all right now when power was given in the first church age second Church age Third Church age like I said a couple of Sundays ago it's kind of strange that that third age parallel with the seals the first three ages and that third age ended in 606 which was the Nan Council all right which they began in 606 to declare that Jesus was not the substance of God but a light substance so he was another person another personality and there's where your Trinity of the godhead came about there at n brother Brown calls it the Deeds of the nickan cuz they conquered the Ley with the Deeds that they started with remember the Bible say it was a saying from a saying it become a Doctrine and all the way up let's read that let's take the seal book page 143 in this book R paragraph 292 everybody okay there paragraph 2992 first seal got it should be around on top of your page if you got a seal book like this one right on top paragraph 292 got it okay who is this mysterious riter of the first church age then who is he let's think of it who is this mysterious riter that starts forth in the first age and rides Plum on out into eternity cuz remember like I said Satan got off of that horse but the horse just kept on go it cuz the people gave it the power when when he became a pope and they became remember a crown was given brother Bram said you can't Crown a spirit so it started right there and in in Paul's age he said Grievious wolves remember we read would come in among you and he even gets to far to say hey some of you inside of this group is going to lead some of the people away all right and rides Plum out into eternity so he gets off one horse that horse already has his characteristic and he just keeps on riding cuz what he's riding right on in the people that father son Holy Ghost baptism um the Trinity all that came about of this white righteous church this white righteous animal horse the power horse is the power the power what the people gave the horse the power Satan just gets off of that horse he's already he's already got those people duped or are um deceived so he gets on another horse we're going to see that again that he'll get on the second horse cuz he had something else to do remember I said before God never changes his way God never changes his tactic but Satan always Chang his head he'll get on a white horse and he oh well they're going to know what's going on so I'm going to go jump over here or I can't get you this way I'll get you another way remember brother said he said Satan's got one shot right wherever your weakness is he's got one shot am right and when he's and and he's and he said he had a right for that one shot but when he makes that shot you better make sure you got it covered cuz he's coming for it whatever weakness you got he's going to try you all right now let's go down to paragraph 294 a white horse rider went out see who is he he is mighty in his conquering power he is a great fellow in his conquering power you want me to tell you who he is he's the Antichrist exactly what he is now because you see if if if an antichrist Jesus said that two would be so close together until it would deceive the very the bride if it was possible Antichrist it's the Antichrist Spirit hadn't been crowned yet Antichrist Spirit but we see in the first seal it said a crown was given so there had to be some flesh come on this guy or whoever this person is all right remember in the church ages when we opened the first church age back there we found out that the holy Spirit was against a certain thing that got started in that church age and that was called the Deeds of the nicians you remember congregation says amen niiko means conquer Ley means the church the Ley niik lean to conquer the Le take the Holy Spirit out of the church and give it all to one holy man let him be the boss of all of it you went through it see nickan notice nickan was a saying come out of saying Paul age Grievous wolves is going to come a Sayan CU see there was no Trinity back in the first three Church ages but they began to talk about it speak about it Satan got in the congregation and started putting a seed in people's mind you know this Jesus guy how could he be God he said he was the son of God that makes him a lower form a son so there must be a father son then there must be a father son Holy Ghost then there must be a woman involved because you got to have a woman to have a birth so let's bring Mary into this thing see how easy it is I can just sit here and try I can make it so pretty I can almost make you believe it sitting right here then it just looks so strange that you'd have God come down in a son and and be a baby and be born of a virgin and and like brother Rand said he said uh a natural birth is more complicated than a than the the Virgin birth cuz it was God creating but like the people in the message they say God created the egg and a germ and then it just grew up a man and then he become God at the River Jordan well you know what you're right back to NAA again you're right back to that old doctrine that there's three Gods cuz if they say there's even just two Gods that's right the two Lord Doctrine and all that stuff he's not two that's right remember I told you in the Bible y'all looked it up for me it says the Holy One of Israel o n e One right I will not see let my holy number two see corruption that's what most people say I I'll not let my holy number two see corruption no it says my Holy One see corruption all right but you see how easy though you can come in here and you with flattery with flattery you can start that's right you could start digging just a little bit and I can do it I'm a minister I can do it I can twist your mind I mean you may the Holy Spirit may catch it sometimes the Holy Spirit may not catch it but the Holy Spirit somewhere is going to catch it if you got the real holy ghost in your soul something's going to sitting in many times in a service um and something just say that's not right that's right something's not right that's right that's not right and you feel it right inside that's right and and it's worse when about 300 other people are shouting and praising God over the over the error and you're sitting there going this ain't right but people shout over anything that's that's how it got started in the first age same thing that same Spirit listen people that Spirit never died that's right Spirits don't die Spirits over in Jamaica don't die they Same Spirit over here like Keith said just to color the Skin's a little bit different same devil all right same action same tactics you think if you went on an island by yourself you wouldn't have any any false Doctrine but if it's more than one you've got two IDE not that you heard that story about the guy that uh they found him on an island and he was all by himself there was two buildings there and he said guy come to get him you know been about 5 years I come to get him said what is that he said well that's the church that I go to only one guy on the whole island you know that's the church I go to now and the man said well what's this building over here he said well that's the church I used to go to funny but it's not funny but it's not all right take the Holy Spirit out of the church and give it all to one holy man let him be the boss of all of it you went through it see nickan notice nician was a saying in one Church it became a Doctrine in the next Church age still can't Crown a Doctrine but when you come up to that third age and in the Third Church age it was a forcement and they had deny see a counsel and it was then made a Doctrine go down to 297 to save time look he started out to conquer notice he has no Crown the white horse rider I'm speaking of here a bow and the crown was given him afterward who give it to him the people that's why you must hear the true word of God to combat this that's right to combat this horse Rider but he's a bluff he has a word with no power okay he has no Crown see he had no Crown to start with but a crown was given him notice later he was given a crown yeah three of them three on one that was 300 years later at the naasan council when he started out a spirit of nickan to form an organization among the people and then it kept on going going on became a saying and then it became a Doctrine now look at save time 301 when n nican see the Antichrist is finally he is carnate in a man then he's crowned when he started off as a nickan spirit in the church he's a spirit you can't Crown a spirit but 300 years later he became a pope and what's he talking about he's talking about the first Nan counsil was 300 a day the second I counsel when they put this thing into a law and a Doctrine was 606 so it was 300 years later all right put 300 years Satan's Satan's got patience Satan's got more patience than you got to that you perfect man that's right okay so don't think he's no he's patient right he just comes in with flattery the Bible say just a little bit here and a little bit there see if you come in with with with with that dark horse at first youd know yeah you come in with that black horse you say opposition but he came in with a white horse just like Jesus riding a white horse in the Millennium he pulled that out of God's mind he pull that out of the Bible in other words the Bible don't you think Satan saw all that stuff he saw it what did remember when Jesus came on Earth the brother read it the other Sunday Satan took him on a mountain and showed him what the world every nation right brother BR said show him United States so it wasn't just then over there in Palestine he showed him forward to right now all right so guess what Satan's got a little bit of forethought yes the only problem is he's an unbeliever yes he don't believe this is going to happen to him he don't believe that somebody's going to break his bond and knock him off his horse okay cuz he's had so much success this is the whole thing about this seal book this seal open Satan has had so much success even after the seals were open in 1963 people kept dying the prophet died so Satan's like there's nothing to this all there's got to be a people stand up and say this is what's going to happen this it's going to happen to me right death toward your Ste grave toward your Victory just like I said here in our our our theme is in my flesh I shall see God that's good that's good for job to say that cuz he's dead but see in my flesh I shall see God without dying that's right without dying in my flesh but this right here this s I'm not talking about this book you understand the revelation of these seals somebody's going to pick it up and somebody's going to carry it on and somebody is going to take those four horses and Destroy them cuz they're they're all death brother R when we get in that fourth seal he'll say it was death from the beginning but we're just now able to name it see it was death to begin with this white righteous Church what that killed people brother brandham said 68 million Jews I mean 68 million Protestants were killed he said Untold billion spiritually killed that's the worst to kill 68 million Christians you just put them in heaven but when you kill 68 million people that are not Christians you put them in hell you've done worse to them if you if you had physically killed them than to spiritually kill them and let them just keep on going thinking that they are right what's the mystery of iniquity iniquity is knowing to do something and you do it anyway that's worse than not knowing what you're doing we come up to the end time and things we know not to do we do them anyway that's right see that's where we got to get rid of that thing all right let's finish reading right here get up front so s Fran can sing for but now look in paragraph 302 he's talking about the pope and all that but now look Glory notice and when this holy spirit that we have now let's talk about the opposition this holy spirit that we have becomes incarnate to us the one that's in our midst now in the form of the Holy Ghost becomes incarnate to us in the person of Jesus Christ will crown him King of Kings now where are we going to crown him here we in our flesh are going to Crown in King of Kings here cuz if he's not King over this it's going to die when he resurrected all power in heaven and earth been given unto me why he had rulership over everything he didn't have rulership over his body he said well wait a minute he had to sleep he had to eat he had to function as a human being remember he was tired went to sleep in a boat remember he got aggravated with a group of people one time and planted a rope see but when he come out of that grave he said all power all all power brother BR said if he another God he don't have a lick of power if we believe what Jesus said we believe what Jesus said there's no other God that's got any power anywhere but see that's that's not the second person of the Trinity saying that that's almighty God saying cuz all power in Heaven and Earth has been given unto me like brother Brown said if there's another God somewhere he's powerless that's right so when when he gains preeminence here that's when he's prown that's when Crown now we'll let you know how we going to Crown I I was telling somebody the other day when we talk about crowns Crown we think is Look up the word Crown it's glory it's honor most crowns are um trying to think of the word but it it's it's more like leaves oh yeah Ivy um you've seen them before maybe in your country that season that's correct because when we crown him King of Kings I don't think we're literally going to go up there and put we're not going to all be wearing a crown I just want think that it's going to be the crowning Glory all right we give him total preeminence in our life we crown him that's right see we then we if we literally put a crown on his head that's fine with me but when we're crowned and cap with that Capstone we're not going to walk around and I'm not trying to be sacrilegious or funny but when we're crowned with a Capstone we're not going to walk around with a pyramid hat on top of our head I mean I'm not trying that's not none at all but I'm trying to make a pointal crown for us to know who he is right no that's right no no he when he come out of that grave he was crowned king of Lord case King but see he's still Satan's got a little preeminence sorry guys Satan's got a little bit in all of us we got bad thoughts and all these these got a little but I'm going to tell you something I'm going to make this plain brother brand said this thing right here is going to be sticky till the day we are changed this thing right here because it came from your natural parents and you're going to fight it till the day you're changed and and dad's trying his best to show us a simple way to not know how the change is going to happen but understand that we're in the right time we've got the right word we're we're in the right position that's right to walk into a change brother said what a change just a change just change just a change Abraham and Sarah I don't believe his hair started getting darker one day and dark no I believe he was changed the Bible said we'll be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye I believe Sarah and Abraham just woke up one morning and he looked over at her and he thought he got in the bed with the wrong woman and she looked over and looked at him and said I'm definitely in the bed with the wrong man no they looked at each other and they knew because see they' lived together since they were children you know 16 17 years old they lived together so they knew each other as they were young so they looked over at each other and I I believe it kind of sparked in Abraham's mind he said Now's the Time right he met MDC and fed him and and and MDC said one thing that's very important he said can I withhold anything from Abraham can I withhold anything see that's the end time right now we may meet MDC which we should have in our new birth we and we shouldn't meet MDC why because he's a priest he's a preacher he's a priest he's a high priest if we meet him that's what he's saying to you if he communes with you like Keith said last night there's certain times that that that you have to just sit down and and work it out with you and God alone that's right there no man can do it for you no man can have an answer if somebody was to come talk to me about losing their wife I couldn't talk to them I couldn't do that now brother Gary Atkins could and some of the others did their wives were pass on you see I couldn't enter into that right but it would take another brother or it would take you just sitting down with God and just say God I ain't nobody I can talk to but you and God alone but still you got to have a high priest you got to have a priest and that's what Abraham recognized who he was right one God not three he said Lord one so we got to recognize one true Living God and then he said can I withhold anything from Abraham and that's what he's saying to you and I in the opening of the seals he said I now cannot withhold anything from you because you've come to a position then 30 days later they were changed cuz remember what did God say he said about what the time of life the other 28 days you know 30 days you women know what I'm talking about you cycle you going to be changed cuz you think you going to have a baby so from the time he m m cassid it was only a 30-day period but now remember during that 30-day period he gave his wife away again remember she'd done been changed she' done been changed at that there at the end and went down to guer remember and she was beautiful brother BR didn't Mar that old 100y old grandma he said that ought to prove as a change right there he said that King can have thousands of beautiful young women and here he wanted that one oh grandma no she'd already been changed back so during that time in there so that's what I'm telling you to make a point we're still going to have problems even heading toward the change of the body we're still going to have even though we're fixing to get ready to birth the promised son we still going to have problem and we got to watch ourselves amen okay because you still live in this thing right here Abraham still wanted to save what his stinking flesh the prophet said he didn't want to lose his life he wanted to save himself so he told a little lie but watch how God is God said hey a I'll not hear you until you get that man to pray for you that what because he had promised that man that man had to promise a didn't have the promise Abraham had the promise that's what I tell you about all the time all the time don't worry about the journey when Abraham come to the end he just walked right into that body chamber but now he was in the right place at the right time if he would have been off her and sheep somewhere and God walked by he'd have missed it but he was sitting in the right place he had his little wife with him they were doing the right then here come God I was just thinking always said God it to us a little bit at a time we can't take we couldn't take it that's correct and when when mes came to Abraham he had to be that had to be a long visy because they cooked that P well he butchered the cow he cooked it brother R said made buttermilk so it takes a little while to make buttermilk they had a long visit sure they were there for probably a day or so you know who knows because like I said you take a calf and you butcher it you you Slaughter it I know you know even deer hunting it takes a while to to skin one out and clean it out and then they cooked it then they make cakes so it was a visit that wasn't a 5minute visit Abraham didn't go create cakes no he was a human he had to bake them you know him and Sarah so it was a journey that they took but Abraham one thing when MDC got ready to leave remember what he said one more time can I withhold any anything from this man and brother brandham said we are a type of Abraham actually Abraham the type of us everything types the bride we don't type Abraham Abraham typed us Isaac typed us okay everything in this Bible types me and you we don't type people remember we're not a type we are the person that God looked for we are the image that he wanted we're not a type of the image that he wanted we're the image that he he wanted we're supposed to be God made manifest in another form Abraham couldn't do that cuz Abraham didn't have the new birth Abraham had an anointing he had a promise God honored that promise but Abraham was not bride you and I are bride we're Sons and Daughters of God Abraham cannot look at God and say God you're my father sure he can in the Old Testament terms of being Jehovah God that's right but his father far as being in the lineage of being a son he wasn't a son I don't see why people can't believe that cuz the Holy Ghost did not fail in in the Old Testament they had an anointing just like an anointed one that God would anoint that spirit and then he would lift off and then Abraham could do what he did give his wife away laugh at God do the things that he done David could do the things he done I I don't it's to me it's very simple brother R said if David had had a new birth he'd have never done what he done that's right right but he did it in his flesh right but God so loved David because so David had a heart that we got to remember God can see all things he he saw David's Integrity David loved God but he couldn't control what because that rider was riding in him huh Satan was right there come on people Satan's right there he's not far
