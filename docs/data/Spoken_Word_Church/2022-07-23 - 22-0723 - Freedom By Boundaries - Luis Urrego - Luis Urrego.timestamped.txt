[24:10] this glorious
[24:28] i'm in this church
[24:31] i'm in this church
[24:34] this way is
[24:38] [Music]
[24:48] is
[25:10] okay i just wanted to give a testimony
[25:13] coming from a young person
[25:16] a couple weeks ago i was at byc for the
[25:18] first time and
[25:20] i experienced a lot of things
[25:22] a lot of different things
[25:25] but
[25:27] so we were in our dorms all the girls
[25:30] and
[25:30] each night we'd have a devotional and
[25:33] one of the times we were told to write
[25:35] on a piece of paper
[25:37] something that we wanted to get rid of
[25:39] our lives whether it was feelings or
[25:42] physical things
[25:44] and um
[25:46] we weren't supposed to tell anybody but
[25:48] later that day we had a bonfire
[25:51] and we had threw him in the fire
[25:54] um
[25:56] and
[25:57] personally for me i wasn't supposed to
[25:59] tell anyone but
[26:01] because it was so special i had to share
[26:03] with the counselor
[26:05] the next day for our next devotion she
[26:07] wrote on a piece of paper for everybody
[26:09] that were good enough and she handed it
[26:11] to all of us and i just thought it was
[26:13] so special how the day before that the
[26:15] one thing i had wrote is never feeling
[26:17] good enough because that's something
[26:19] i've struggled with a long time and
[26:22] the fact that she wrote that like it
[26:23] could have been anything
[26:25] and i just thought that was that was
[26:27] god's way of telling me that i'm enough
[26:29] so if anybody's feeling that we just
[26:31] know it's a lie
[26:32] because you are enough
[26:36] [Applause]
[26:43] so we have uh three three new
[26:45] specialists so that's wonderful we have
[26:47] plenty of time if there's more that's
[26:49] great but right now we'll have with

[1:03:39] words if you are alive
[1:03:42] man
[1:03:43] seek those things which are above
[1:03:47] the thing is is that when you are alive
[1:03:48] and when you are risen in christ you
[1:03:50] will want to seek those things that are
[1:03:52] above
[1:03:53] where christ sitteth on the right hand
[1:03:55] of
[1:03:57] where's to set your affection on
[1:04:00] things above
[1:04:02] amen what is the word affection the word
[1:04:05] affection is
[1:04:06] something that you love dearly something
[1:04:08] that that that you hold dear to your
[1:04:11] heart and that is very very special to
[1:04:14] you
[1:04:15] so paul here is telling us set your
[1:04:17] affection
[1:04:19] that thing that you really love what is
[1:04:21] that thing that you really love
[1:04:23] in your life right now many of us may
[1:04:25] have different things some some of us
[1:04:26] may like to garden
[1:04:28] man that's an affection that you have
[1:04:30] for gardening some of us like
[1:04:33] collecting shoes i have a brother-in-law
[1:04:35] who used to like doing that up in canada
[1:04:37] he collected shoes had all kinds of
[1:04:39] shoes
[1:04:40] they know what to do with them so you
[1:04:41] started giving me some of them
[1:04:44] i got some penny hard ways up there i
[1:04:46] don't even use them
[1:04:48] uh
[1:04:50] not penny harvey kobe bryant's
[1:04:52] it might be worth some money
[1:04:54] but uh
[1:04:55] yeah that might be their your affection
[1:04:57] you some some some people's affection
[1:04:59] are collecting video games
[1:05:01] you know some people's affection
[1:05:03] different things but paul here is
[1:05:05] telling us set your affection on things
[1:05:08] above
[1:05:10] amen in other words it's beyond anything
[1:05:13] else in this world it's okay to do your
[1:05:14] garden and we need that it's okay to
[1:05:16] collect your guns it's okay to collect
[1:05:18] this your shoes it's okay to collect
[1:05:21] cars
[1:05:22] amen
[1:05:23] but is that where is your affection
[1:05:26] will you die if you don't have your cars
[1:05:28] or will you die if you don't have christ
[1:05:31] you see praise the lord
[1:05:33] it says set your affection on things
[1:05:34] above not on things on the earth
[1:05:38] for ye are dead and your life is hid
[1:05:41] with christ and god praise the lord
[1:05:43] jesus amen i want to talk this this
[1:05:45] afternoon a little bit about boundaries
[1:05:47] amen and i want to i don't i want to i
[1:05:49] want to
[1:05:50] i want us to think about this this
[1:05:52] phrase
[1:05:54] freedom by boundaries
[1:05:56] freedom by boundaries amen
[1:05:59] because
[1:06:00] sometimes we think that there is we're
[1:06:02] bound when there are boundaries in our
[1:06:05] life
[1:06:06] but in reality you're free
[1:06:09] by those boundaries
[1:06:11] if we don't have boundaries
[1:06:13] then everything goes
[1:06:15] uh array everything gets out of cater
[1:06:18] gets out of order and therefore we need
[1:06:20] to have boundaries so let's we're going
[1:06:22] to talk about freedom by boundary so
[1:06:23] let's just buy our heads and how many
[1:06:25] have a need on their heart if you just
[1:06:27] make it i know we all have needs amen
[1:06:30] you say lord i have a spiritual need i
[1:06:31] have a physical need my body needs
[1:06:33] healing my children need salvation and
[1:06:36] god knows your need god knows every need
[1:06:38] behind that hand and he's more than able
[1:06:40] to meet that need so let's just go to
[1:06:41] the lord in prayer heavenly father as we
[1:06:43] come before you lord jesus we thank you
[1:06:45] for the opportunity lord that you give
[1:06:47] us father to open back the pages of your
[1:06:50] word and lord not to hear a man lord god
[1:06:52] but to hear father that christ speaking
[1:06:55] to us lord jesus i don't know all the
[1:06:57] needs that are represented here but you
[1:06:59] do lord and every young person here
[1:07:03] every middle-aged person here every
[1:07:05] older person here has a need behind
[1:07:07] those hands and i pray that you will
[1:07:08] just meet that need according to your
[1:07:11] riches in glory lord
[1:07:13] we pray that you would continue blessing
[1:07:15] lord god
[1:07:16] the rest of the service and every
[1:07:18] activity that's being done
[1:07:20] and lord father let everything that we
[1:07:21] do say and think be honored to you help
[1:07:23] me to get aside lord so that you'd use
[1:07:26] my lips to speak to your people lord and
[1:07:28] we just commit this time into your hands
[1:07:30] lord for it's your word lord jesus in
[1:07:33] jesus christ and we pray amen amen you
[1:07:36] may be seated
[1:07:37] praise the lord i know those seats ain't
[1:07:38] the most
[1:07:40] comfortable so
[1:07:43] if i see a lot of squirming stuff we'll
[1:07:45] just stand up for a little bit
[1:07:47] or you're welcome to do that if you want
[1:07:50] but
[1:07:53] freedom by boundaries i want to
[1:07:57] you know when i was
[1:07:59] when i was a
[1:08:00] younger i used to play soccer
[1:08:03] and uh
[1:08:04] i really liked soccer
[1:08:08] i used to play soccer and i wasn't good
[1:08:10] at it but i played goalie
[1:08:12] all right that's mainly what i what i
[1:08:13] would play and i got plenty of times i
[1:08:15] got hit in the head with the ball
[1:08:18] seen white for about 10 seconds
[1:08:21] but
[1:08:23] sometimes it back in my home country you
[1:08:25] know we didn't have goals we didn't have
[1:08:27] goals i mean so we would make up our own
[1:08:29] goals our own goals so we built would
[1:08:32] build like a little
[1:08:33] one stick here one stick here and
[1:08:35] another stick here touching each other
[1:08:37] and that would be our little goals that
[1:08:38] we would have and that would be that and
[1:08:41] that's where we would play but see that
[1:08:42] would be our boundaries that we would
[1:08:44] have you see we would make our own
[1:08:47] little boundaries
[1:08:48] a goal out here is a boundary see we
[1:08:51] have boundaries right here on this and
[1:08:53] this and this court in this basketball
[1:08:55] court you see if the ball comes out at a
[1:08:58] certain place
[1:08:59] it's out of bounds
[1:09:01] and they they uh they they start they
[1:09:04] start blowing
[1:09:08] you hear that
[1:09:11] right
[1:09:12] when you're out of bounds that's what
[1:09:14] you're gonna hear
[1:09:19] when you're wrong that's what you're
[1:09:20] going to hear
[1:09:22] right when you're in the wrong
[1:09:24] what does that mean
[1:09:26] that means get back in step right
[1:09:28] i mean get back in bounds or
[1:09:31] or or do what you're supposed to do
[1:09:33] praise the lord jesus
[1:09:35] that is the exact same thing sayings
[1:09:36] that that that the word of god is to us
[1:09:38] amen
[1:09:40] it's it's that it's that whistle amen
[1:09:42] when we step out of bounds when we get
[1:09:45] out of our boundary amen that god knows
[1:09:47] that you are going you are on your way
[1:09:50] out of freedom
[1:09:51] amen out of what you're supposed to be
[1:09:53] doing so he amen he uses a preacher he
[1:09:56] uses the word he uses whatever he needs
[1:09:58] to use
[1:10:00] in order to get get back instead amen
[1:10:03] praise the lord jesus
[1:10:05] so
[1:10:06] you know in soccer you know you have you
[1:10:08] have uh goalkeepers
[1:10:11] and goalkeepers uh uh
[1:10:13] you know they're there to guard the ball
[1:10:15] so that the other team won't score in
[1:10:17] that goal you see
[1:10:18] and satan satan is the one that that he
[1:10:21] he's there trying to block our life
[1:10:23] i mean he's there doing everything he
[1:10:25] can to make sure that you don't score
[1:10:27] and you're supposed to do what what you
[1:10:29] have to do amen in order to scale and
[1:10:31] scale higher spiritually amen and that's
[1:10:34] what satan is their job he's he's the
[1:10:36] goalkeeper amen you have a goal you have
[1:10:38] a purpose and you have something amen
[1:10:40] that you must do in this life but satan
[1:10:42] is right there he's ready amen he's
[1:10:45] ready at all times he's sometimes i say
[1:10:47] i say a lot of times that he's he's more
[1:10:49] prepared than we are
[1:10:51] he comes to church more than we do
[1:10:53] sometimes
[1:10:54] amen
[1:10:55] but
[1:10:56] he is right there he does his job very
[1:10:58] good
[1:11:00] and he's ready he's ready there to put a
[1:11:02] stop to it because if he had a way he
[1:11:04] wouldn't he wouldn't allow this
[1:11:06] man but some of you all persevered
[1:11:08] and man we all persevered and you're
[1:11:10] here amen because god put something in
[1:11:12] you amen there's something beyond than
[1:11:14] just just fellowship and physically amen
[1:11:17] there's something eternal that we are
[1:11:19] seeking amen and that is the that is
[1:11:22] that is the purpose of what we have in
[1:11:24] this life amen so what is what is a
[1:11:26] boundary
[1:11:27] and the in in the body in the in the
[1:11:29] dictionary boundary is something such as
[1:11:32] a river a fence or an imaginary line
[1:11:36] that shows where an area ends and
[1:11:39] another area begins
[1:11:41] another another definition of it is a
[1:11:43] point or limit that indicates
[1:11:46] where two things become different
[1:11:49] amen and i like that that definition
[1:11:52] because i believe as christians amen we
[1:11:55] should be different
[1:11:57] amen how many believe that
[1:12:00] i mean
[1:12:01] i i i believe that there should be a
[1:12:03] distinction between a christian and a
[1:12:06] worldly person
[1:12:08] now we're not then diminishing the
[1:12:10] worldly person or the sinner amen praise
[1:12:12] god they need christ just as you needed
[1:12:15] christ amen but i believe that when you
[1:12:18] profess christ there has to be a
[1:12:19] difference in your life
[1:12:21] amen there has to be a difference in the
[1:12:23] way you dress there has to be in the
[1:12:24] difference in the way you talk there has
[1:12:26] to be a difference in the way in the way
[1:12:28] you see things amen it can't be the same
[1:12:30] thing and say that you are putting your
[1:12:33] affections on things above
[1:12:35] because you're still looking at earthly
[1:12:37] things
[1:12:38] and you're trying to mix them with
[1:12:39] christianity and that doesn't work
[1:12:41] there's no boundary in that
[1:12:44] now how many believe that god likes
[1:12:45] boundaries
[1:12:48] the the best the best the
[1:12:50] this is the best uh uh example of a
[1:12:53] boundary that we have
[1:12:55] the word of god this is the rule book
[1:12:58] right just this just as a a referee in a
[1:13:01] basketball game or a volleyball game has
[1:13:03] a rule book that he goes by he can't
[1:13:06] just be blowing the whistle just to blow
[1:13:08] it
[1:13:09] whenever he don't like you so he's going
[1:13:10] to blow that whistle every time you
[1:13:13] you touch the ball you
[1:13:19] you hit the ball
[1:13:21] no no
[1:13:22] but that's not what the word of god does
[1:13:24] right the word of god
[1:13:27] has certain rules has certain boundaries
[1:13:30] but it's not just a free thing a
[1:13:32] free-for-all he he has he knows what
[1:13:34] he's talking about in other words
[1:13:36] now when the referee blows his whistle
[1:13:39] amen
[1:13:45] when he blows his whistle
[1:13:47] everybody
[1:13:48] you know
[1:13:50] pays attention right
[1:13:53] and you may not agree
[1:13:58] not everybody agrees but he's the
[1:14:00] absolute
[1:14:02] he's the one that's got the whistle he's
[1:14:04] the one that's got the rule book he's
[1:14:05] the one that that is in charge of making
[1:14:07] sure everything's right
[1:14:09] and it doesn't matter if everybody
[1:14:11] understands throws cups at him throws
[1:14:14] tomatoes at him he's got a job to do
[1:14:17] praise the lord jesus and it doesn't
[1:14:18] matter amen what people say what people
[1:14:21] think praise god the bible already gives
[1:14:24] us something definite and we got to
[1:14:26] stick to that
[1:14:28] amen that's why
[1:14:30] us preachers amen we got to preach the
[1:14:31] word
[1:14:33] we we can't preach our own ideas we
[1:14:35] can't preach our own opinions we can't
[1:14:37] preach joe olsteen we can't preach uh uh
[1:14:40] you know you know we got to preach the
[1:14:42] word of god
[1:14:44] because that is the ultimate that is the
[1:14:46] that is the rule book praise the lord so
[1:14:49] a point a limit that indicates where two
[1:14:51] things become different
[1:14:54] so
[1:14:54] there's there's a difference amen
[1:14:56] there's a difference but if i go past
[1:14:58] this line i'm out of bounds but if i
[1:15:00] stay in this line right here i'm in
[1:15:02] bounds there's a difference right praise
[1:15:05] the lord jesus i mean you're still with
[1:15:07] me
[1:15:09] so boundaries they're they're
[1:15:10] essentially for keeping things in order
[1:15:13] and and to flow smoothly
[1:15:15] and i want to encourage you young people
[1:15:17] i want to encourage you uh children
[1:15:20] hey man when we we have to have
[1:15:22] boundaries everywhere we go we have to
[1:15:25] have boundaries in our homes
[1:15:27] amen you have to have certain boundaries
[1:15:29] in your own even in your own room
[1:15:32] you you know some of you who have your
[1:15:34] own room there are certain boundaries
[1:15:35] there are certain limits certain things
[1:15:37] that that you won't allow
[1:15:40] amen
[1:15:41] some of you you know don't don't you
[1:15:43] know
[1:15:44] they have your own room at 15 16 17 18
[1:15:47] year old hey man you just don't want any
[1:15:49] three-year-old to come in there and just
[1:15:50] start messing around with everything
[1:15:52] that you got and everything hey man
[1:15:54] because you have limits you have you set
[1:15:56] your own boundaries for your own room
[1:15:58] right
[1:15:59] see you you set your own boundaries
[1:16:02] and so don't get upset when the parent
[1:16:04] at the house is trying to set their own
[1:16:06] boundaries in their own domain
[1:16:08] praise god we got boundaries too and we
[1:16:11] just don't want anything to be done
[1:16:12] around there or or anything to be said
[1:16:15] amen we have to have our own boundaries
[1:16:17] as well
[1:16:18] and not just that it's because the rule
[1:16:19] book said so
[1:16:22] amen
[1:16:23] and because we love you and god loves
[1:16:25] you
[1:16:26] amen so
[1:16:27] those boundaries are there
[1:16:30] for freedom so that you can maintain
[1:16:32] your peace
[1:16:33] your sanity
[1:16:34] your freedom
[1:16:36] praise god it's not to bound you
[1:16:39] praise the lord it's not it's not to
[1:16:40] keep you
[1:16:42] restricted you can't go anywhere you
[1:16:44] can't do anything amen it's to keep
[1:16:46] certain things flowing in order in a
[1:16:48] certain direction
[1:16:50] because our prayer us as parents and god
[1:16:52] has a vision of you
[1:16:55] right we have visions
[1:16:56] of of you
[1:16:58] and
[1:16:59] and and it's positive visions just as
[1:17:01] god said in his word that he told
[1:17:03] jeremiah that i have i have what is that
[1:17:06] uh i have known you or i have seen you i
[1:17:09] have i have uh i have forgot the the the
[1:17:12] verse
[1:17:13] but it's something on the line so that
[1:17:14] you can have a positive end
[1:17:16] right
[1:17:18] and that's what we desire is for you to
[1:17:20] have a positive end
[1:17:22] therefore we've got to implement
[1:17:24] boundaries
[1:17:26] so that you may have a positive end
[1:17:28] praise the lord so there is sent there
[1:17:30] for keeping things in order
[1:17:33] now the children of israel when they
[1:17:34] were receiving their inheritance
[1:17:37] amen and joshua was given out the the
[1:17:39] inheritances for each area they were
[1:17:42] supposed to have the joshua was saying
[1:17:45] this this tribe will have this piece of
[1:17:48] land
[1:17:49] and this tribe will have this piece of
[1:17:51] land and this tribe will have this piece
[1:17:53] of land you can read that in the book of
[1:17:55] in the book of joshua
[1:17:57] and god
[1:17:59] gave wisdom to joshua revealed to joshua
[1:18:02] amen where each one was to be located
[1:18:04] and they could not cross each other
[1:18:07] right they had to respect each other's
[1:18:09] boundaries
[1:18:11] praise god
[1:18:12] so boundaries are important to god
[1:18:15] amen and and like i said each tribe they
[1:18:17] received their portion
[1:18:19] and they couldn't step out of bounds
[1:18:20] praise god
[1:18:22] now as i we was just talking about you
[1:18:24] can't even play sports if there's no
[1:18:25] boundaries right
[1:18:27] you can't even play you there there's
[1:18:30] nothing that there's no game that you
[1:18:32] can play there's no there is no sport
[1:18:35] that is played and there are no
[1:18:36] boundaries in place there has to be
[1:18:38] boundaries if everything is free for all
[1:18:41] we could just it's really no fun
[1:18:44] you think about it
[1:18:46] it's not fun when everybody can just do
[1:18:48] whatever they want to
[1:18:50] and i remember sometimes you know i am
[1:18:52] the type of person that i like to play
[1:18:54] games by the rules right
[1:18:57] and when i would play basketball or
[1:18:59] where i play soccer and i'd be very
[1:19:02] concentrated and and i wanted to just
[1:19:04] play
[1:19:05] you know and just have a good game going
[1:19:07] you know
[1:19:08] i play out in the rain i play out but
[1:19:11] then with my friends when they start
[1:19:13] getting bored and they just kind of
[1:19:14] start slacking and just shooting around
[1:19:16] and just man i'm like man forget y'all
[1:19:18] man i'll just go home
[1:19:21] it's boring then when you don't set any
[1:19:23] any boundaries you see everybody's all
[1:19:26] loose about everything you see and
[1:19:28] that's what god doesn't want us to do
[1:19:30] just be loose about everything
[1:19:32] amen but have some boundaries in your
[1:19:34] life praise the lord jesus
[1:19:36] now i want us to read here for just a
[1:19:38] moment
[1:19:39] i want us to look at a story here in the
[1:19:41] book of first samuel first samuel
[1:19:43] chapter eight
[1:19:45] if you have your bibles we want to read
[1:19:46] here
[1:19:48] a few verses
[1:19:51] i want us to look at something here real
[1:19:53] quick
[1:19:54] first samuel chapter 8 verse 1.
[1:20:01] man the bible says here and it came to
[1:20:04] pass when samuel was old samuel being
[1:20:08] the prophet of god
[1:20:10] that he made his sons judges over israel
[1:20:14] now the name of his firstborn was joel
[1:20:17] in the name of his second abaya
[1:20:20] they were judges in beersheba
[1:20:23] and his sons walked not in his ways but
[1:20:27] turned aside after luker and took bribes
[1:20:31] and perverted judgment
[1:20:33] so his sons did not did not go after
[1:20:35] their his father's ways their father's
[1:20:37] ways
[1:20:40] then all the elders of israel gathered
[1:20:43] themselves together and came to samuel
[1:20:45] unto rhema
[1:20:46] so here comes all the people around
[1:20:48] israel everybody all the elders and they
[1:20:51] gather around samuel and this look what
[1:20:53] they tell him and said unto him
[1:20:56] watch pay attention and say unto him
[1:20:58] behold samuel you're old
[1:21:01] and your sons are not walking in your
[1:21:03] ways
[1:21:04] now make us a king
[1:21:06] to judge us like all the nations
[1:21:10] they wanted a king
[1:21:12] so that they could be like everybody
[1:21:15] else
[1:21:18] right
[1:21:19] when god was their king
[1:21:21] amen using the prophet samuel he was
[1:21:24] speaking directly to samuel and they
[1:21:26] would get the word from samuel right
[1:21:29] and that was the boundary that god had
[1:21:31] placed in their life and they were
[1:21:33] living like that and there was peace
[1:21:35] there was there was
[1:21:37] they had they had peace in their life
[1:21:39] you see everything was flowing fine but
[1:21:41] when they started looking at everybody
[1:21:43] else in the world and how they did
[1:21:45] things
[1:21:47] now they desire the same exact thing
[1:21:51] i mean certain certain person
[1:21:53] she wears these type of shoes i gotta
[1:21:55] have those shoes i gotta have that
[1:21:57] certain look i've gotta
[1:22:00] you you see it was the exact same thing
[1:22:03] they desire it is it's a human thing to
[1:22:06] want to be like somebody else
[1:22:09] there's nothing wrong with that
[1:22:11] there's a reason why we have to be good
[1:22:13] examples
[1:22:15] it's it's it's it's it's normal
[1:22:17] to want to to have a model in your life
[1:22:21] you see
[1:22:22] but that's the reason why jesus gave us
[1:22:24] himself to be a role model
[1:22:28] he gave us his word he gave us him he
[1:22:30] showed us how we should live life how we
[1:22:32] should conduct ourselves how we should
[1:22:34] think how we should talk
[1:22:36] but that's the one that we look at the
[1:22:37] less
[1:22:38] and then we wonder why we have so many
[1:22:40] problems in our life
[1:22:42] spiritually and physically
[1:22:46] but we don't look at the right role
[1:22:47] model
[1:22:48] we look at at lebron james we look at at
[1:22:53] whatever pop singer that's out there we
[1:22:55] we look at anime as a role model
[1:22:59] all these different things but we don't
[1:23:01] ever stop to think this role model is
[1:23:04] eternal those other things will pass
[1:23:07] away praise god
[1:23:09] but
[1:23:10] here's israel they want a king just like
[1:23:12] everybody else and in verse 6 it says
[1:23:15] but the thing displeased samuel
[1:23:18] when they said give us a king to judge
[1:23:20] us and samuel prayed unto the lord and
[1:23:22] the lord said unto samuel
[1:23:25] hearken unto the voice of the people in
[1:23:27] other words listen to what they're that
[1:23:29] they're asking for
[1:23:31] go ahead
[1:23:32] that's fine
[1:23:34] hearken unto the voice of the people and
[1:23:35] all that they say unto you
[1:23:38] for they have not rejected you samuel
[1:23:41] but they have rejected me
[1:23:44] this is the lord speaking
[1:23:46] that i should not reign over them
[1:23:50] according to all the works which they
[1:23:52] have done since the day that i brought
[1:23:54] them up out of egypt even unto this day
[1:23:56] where they have forsaken me and served
[1:23:59] other gods so do they also unto thee
[1:24:04] now therefore hearken to their voice
[1:24:07] how be it yet protest solemnly unto them
[1:24:10] and show them the manner of the king
[1:24:13] that shall reign over them and samuel
[1:24:16] told all the words of the lord unto the
[1:24:18] people that asked of him a king in other
[1:24:20] words god told samuel to tell the people
[1:24:23] that's fine
[1:24:24] they can have their own king
[1:24:26] go ahead and let them have
[1:24:28] their their worldly living go ahead and
[1:24:30] let them have what they desire in their
[1:24:32] heart to do
[1:24:34] that's fine let them
[1:24:36] but
[1:24:36] tell them first first first hand
[1:24:39] give them the consequences of that
[1:24:41] decision
[1:24:43] and so samuel gives them the
[1:24:45] consequences of them one and a king
[1:24:48] and this is the consequences that he
[1:24:49] tells them he said he will take their
[1:24:51] sons that king if you have a king he
[1:24:54] will take their sons and make them his
[1:24:55] servants
[1:24:56] his horsemen and drivers of his war
[1:24:59] carriages and they will go running
[1:25:01] before his war carriages in other words
[1:25:03] everybody was to work for the king then
[1:25:06] they didn't have a king then they didn't
[1:25:08] have to do that
[1:25:09] now they're going to have to do that
[1:25:12] right
[1:25:13] the daughters he will take to be makers
[1:25:16] of perfumes and cooks and bread makers
[1:25:18] in other words you're going to be forced
[1:25:20] to work for the king he wants a certain
[1:25:22] style of perfume or a certain cologne
[1:25:25] the daughters are gonna are be tasked to
[1:25:28] make sure that they get that exact scent
[1:25:30] for the king
[1:25:32] they're gonna they that they get him the
[1:25:34] exact cake that he likes to he likes to
[1:25:36] eat that exact thing that he likes
[1:25:39] why because he's the king
[1:25:42] but that's what they want
[1:25:43] he will take a tenth of their of their
[1:25:46] and the fruit of the of the vines and
[1:25:48] give it to his servants in other words
[1:25:50] he will start taking taxes from them
[1:25:53] but they didn't have that
[1:25:55] before the king
[1:25:57] and then another thing is that he will
[1:25:59] take their manservants and their servant
[1:26:01] girls and the best of their oxen and
[1:26:03] their donkeys and put them to his work
[1:26:06] so they could not have
[1:26:08] their their donkeys their cows their
[1:26:10] even their dog
[1:26:12] they couldn't have at their house
[1:26:13] anymore everything had to be just for
[1:26:15] the service of the king
[1:26:17] now this is the warning that samuel gave
[1:26:20] to the children of israel
[1:26:23] right
[1:26:25] just as
[1:26:27] god gives us warning if we go that
[1:26:30] direction if we step out of those
[1:26:32] boundaries that's this is what's going
[1:26:34] to happen it's already laid out in the
[1:26:35] word the problem is is that we don't
[1:26:38] like to look at it
[1:26:40] well i'm just going to do it anyways
[1:26:42] so this is this is exactly what we do
[1:26:48] just walk away and ignore it like in
[1:26:51] there it's never there
[1:26:54] [Music]
[1:26:58] but the word of what god is still
[1:27:00] staring
[1:27:01] it still stands
[1:27:02] it's still established
[1:27:04] just because you ignore it doesn't mean
[1:27:06] you're not going to suffer the
[1:27:07] consequences that it gives
[1:27:09] right
[1:27:11] and so
[1:27:12] samuel gives them this warning
[1:27:14] and this is what they say to samuel and
[1:27:18] in that day you will cry out because of
[1:27:20] your king
[1:27:21] whom you have chosen for yourselves but
[1:27:23] the lord will not answer you in that day
[1:27:27] now watch verse 19. he says but the
[1:27:29] people refused to obey the voice of
[1:27:31] samuel
[1:27:34] and they said no
[1:27:36] but there shall be a king over us
[1:27:39] after samuel had given them exactly
[1:27:42] everything that they were going to
[1:27:44] they were going to suffer they still say
[1:27:46] no
[1:27:47] still give us a a king
[1:27:51] now i i want i want somebody
[1:27:54] i want somebody to tell me
[1:27:57] what that sounds like to you
[1:28:00] what does that sound like to you now
[1:28:02] but what do you think the children of
[1:28:04] people the children of israel
[1:28:06] what does that sound like to you
[1:28:09] after samuel giving uncertain that
[1:28:11] warning and they still say we still want
[1:28:12] a king
[1:28:15] they don't want to listen to samuel they
[1:28:17] want to do what they want to do and not
[1:28:18] listen to the prophet
[1:28:22] what do you think
[1:28:25] i mean is it dumb
[1:28:29] i said it sounds subtle
[1:28:31] doesn't it
[1:28:34] adam what do you think about that
[1:28:43] adam says it's dumb
[1:28:46] how about over here somebody over here
[1:28:48] tell me somebody has been given a
[1:28:50] warning but yet they still go and do it
[1:28:54] michael disobedience
[1:28:58] michael says disobedience that's exactly
[1:29:00] right
[1:29:02] mercy do you have an idea
[1:29:04] no do you think that it's it it's a dumb
[1:29:08] idea to not listen the prophet already
[1:29:11] told them
[1:29:12] but they still just do do what they want
[1:29:14] to do right
[1:29:16] what do you think brother christian
[1:29:19] what's happening today
[1:29:21] amen
[1:29:23] sounds like what happened everybody
[1:29:24] wants to do their own thing praise god
[1:29:27] right so so some people said stupid all
[1:29:30] right i heard stupid over here or dumb
[1:29:33] oh stubborn something
[1:29:36] but it's still stupid
[1:29:38] some people over here said uh
[1:29:40] disobedient michael said disobedient but
[1:29:43] a christian said it sounds like people
[1:29:45] today
[1:29:46] right
[1:29:47] praise the lord jesus
[1:29:48] but i want you to think about this young
[1:29:50] people amen if that sounds like that
[1:29:54] amen
[1:29:56] what is this what are we thinking for
[1:29:58] example as parents when you guys don't
[1:30:00] listen to what we tell you
[1:30:02] under the the word of god
[1:30:06] what are we going to think
[1:30:08] that sounds dumb
[1:30:10] that's stubborn
[1:30:12] that's disobedient
[1:30:13] the exact same things that you're
[1:30:15] thinking about these these people here
[1:30:17] the children of israel is the exact same
[1:30:19] things that we as parents or as
[1:30:21] ministers or as pastors or people over
[1:30:24] you amen what do you think the holy
[1:30:26] spirit as the referee what does he think
[1:30:30] that's stubborn
[1:30:31] that is that's
[1:30:33] that's dumb
[1:30:36] right but he can't do anything because
[1:30:38] he can't force you to do something that
[1:30:40] you don't want to do
[1:30:42] you go ahead go your own way but you're
[1:30:44] going to suffer the consequences
[1:30:46] you get out of bounds amen you're going
[1:30:48] to suffer the consequences praise the
[1:30:50] lord just as somebody keeps
[1:30:52] getting uh uh
[1:30:54] in a game keeps doing the exact same
[1:30:56] thing keeps fouling amen after the fifth
[1:30:58] or sixth foul you're gonna get kicked
[1:31:00] out of the game right because the
[1:31:03] referee said so praise the lord
[1:31:06] but the people here kept going and they
[1:31:08] said here what we also may be like all
[1:31:11] the nations verse 20 and that our team
[1:31:13] may judge us and go out before us and
[1:31:16] fight our battles and when samuel had
[1:31:18] heard all the words of the people he
[1:31:20] repeated them in the ears of the lord
[1:31:22] and the lord said to samuel obey their
[1:31:24] voice and make them a king samuel then
[1:31:27] said to the man of israel go every man
[1:31:30] to his city
[1:31:31] praise god
[1:31:33] so samuel had to do exactly what the
[1:31:35] people want
[1:31:36] see that is the grace of god to us
[1:31:39] that god allows you to make a choice in
[1:31:42] your life
[1:31:44] what if we didn't have a choice
[1:31:46] and we'd all be just robots
[1:31:49] you know
[1:31:50] we're just walking one direction and
[1:31:52] then god pushes us this way so we're
[1:31:54] just gonna go this way and then god says
[1:31:56] go this way back again and then go this
[1:31:58] way and then we're just all robots
[1:32:01] but god allows us to choose
[1:32:04] amen in that choosing you learn lessons
[1:32:09] good or bad or you have positive
[1:32:12] experiences or negative experiences
[1:32:15] right
[1:32:16] but remember there's freedom by having
[1:32:19] boundaries
[1:32:20] god's word is our boundary praise the
[1:32:22] lord amen i'm going to try to move a
[1:32:24] little quickly here so jeremiah tells us
[1:32:27] this for us to seek the old paths he
[1:32:30] says thus said the lord in verse 16 of
[1:32:32] jeremiah chapter 6 thus said the lord
[1:32:34] stand ye in the ways and see and ask for
[1:32:37] the old paths where is the good way and
[1:32:40] walk therein and you shall find rest for
[1:32:44] your souls
[1:32:46] but what the children of israel tell
[1:32:48] them but they said we will not walk
[1:32:49] therein
[1:32:52] those are some stubborn people
[1:32:55] jeremiah's telling them
[1:32:58] amen
[1:32:59] go back to the old paths
[1:33:01] amen go back to the original foundations
[1:33:04] do the original things and watch what he
[1:33:06] said he said and you will find rest for
[1:33:08] your souls
[1:33:10] how many want peace in their soul
[1:33:12] how many want rest in their soul
[1:33:15] i i want rest i want peace i want i want
[1:33:17] an assurance i want something firm to
[1:33:19] stand on
[1:33:21] praise god
[1:33:23] but we seek in everything else
[1:33:26] and not where and not the original
[1:33:28] source
[1:33:29] so we need to seek to go back to those
[1:33:31] old paths
[1:33:33] amen
[1:33:34] some of you some of you children you you
[1:33:37] know you you
[1:33:38] you think your your your parents
[1:33:40] sometimes they talk to you too much and
[1:33:42] you say something like leave me in peace
[1:33:45] leave me in peace
[1:33:47] but in reality there is no peace in your
[1:33:49] heart there is no peace in your life
[1:33:52] amen if you are outside of the bounds of
[1:33:54] the word of god
[1:33:56] there is no real peace in your heart
[1:33:59] that peace will end amen but god's peace
[1:34:02] will it will never end because even if
[1:34:05] you're going through problems in your
[1:34:06] heart in your life even if everything
[1:34:08] your car breaks down and you can't get
[1:34:11] to work if you're if you lose your job
[1:34:13] if you uh whatever it may be you get a
[1:34:16] flat tire or
[1:34:18] or your
[1:34:18] your tennis shoes get scratched up
[1:34:23] you're like oh well
[1:34:25] i got peace and joy in my heart
[1:34:29] amen because i i know the prince of
[1:34:32] peace
[1:34:33] amen
[1:34:34] and that's what matters the most
[1:34:36] praise god
[1:34:38] amen
[1:34:39] praise the lord jesus trying to move a
[1:34:41] little quickly here
[1:34:43] so there is even boundaries and i'll
[1:34:45] just get to a point here in just a
[1:34:46] moment
[1:34:48] we'll get to some some some sticky
[1:34:50] things now
[1:34:52] because
[1:34:53] what is the difference between courtship
[1:34:56] and dating
[1:34:57] right
[1:34:59] there's there's a difference
[1:35:00] i'm like oh well it's just the same
[1:35:02] thing no no wait a second
[1:35:05] dating
[1:35:06] let's look at dating here for just a
[1:35:07] moment
[1:35:09] dating
[1:35:11] has no boundaries
[1:35:15] dating you just
[1:35:16] you could shack up with somebody or you
[1:35:18] could go out with somebody go on a date
[1:35:20] amen and whatever
[1:35:22] it may start something something uh uh
[1:35:25] innocent
[1:35:26] amen and then one thing leads to another
[1:35:28] there is no boundaries there
[1:35:30] one little touch of the hands ends up
[1:35:33] with something else some kissing some
[1:35:35] hugging and then it ends up with
[1:35:36] something that you didn't even think
[1:35:38] about in the first place
[1:35:40] and you're wondering how in the world
[1:35:41] did i get into the situation why because
[1:35:43] you didn't put boundaries in your in
[1:35:45] that in that
[1:35:47] in that thing
[1:35:49] now if you have god in your heart
[1:35:51] god will be the boundaries you see
[1:35:54] that's the reason why young people we
[1:35:56] don't we don't encourage them
[1:35:59] man
[1:36:00] we don't encourage you just to go from
[1:36:02] one person to the other one person to
[1:36:04] the other and let me just try this one
[1:36:06] let me just try another one and let me
[1:36:07] just oh this one no it doesn't work that
[1:36:10] way
[1:36:11] have a goal in mind
[1:36:12] have something that that you are aiming
[1:36:14] for amen and i hope that that is
[1:36:16] marriage
[1:36:17] right
[1:36:18] and then and that's that's what
[1:36:20] courtship is courtship is is you aiming
[1:36:23] is two mature people
[1:36:26] two mature people that are actually
[1:36:28] aiming amen they're they're seeing each
[1:36:30] other they're they're
[1:36:32] they're talking to each other and
[1:36:33] everybody around them knows about it
[1:36:37] that's one of the main things
[1:36:39] everybody around knows about it
[1:36:42] and that there's a pastor knows about it
[1:36:44] their parents know about it
[1:36:46] why because they want to do things by
[1:36:48] those boundaries
[1:36:50] so that things don't get out of hand you
[1:36:52] see
[1:36:53] and they have a goal in mind we want to
[1:36:56] marry we want to we this is our goal you
[1:36:58] see
[1:36:59] but in dating there is no goal
[1:37:01] and dating is just to have a good time
[1:37:03] and that good time could lead to other
[1:37:05] things that you
[1:37:06] eventually you'll end up regretting
[1:37:09] now i've had friends that have gone
[1:37:11] there done that
[1:37:14] even when i was in high school
[1:37:16] i had a friend in 10th grade
[1:37:19] got a girl pregnant
[1:37:21] he had a baby at 10th grade in 10th
[1:37:23] grade
[1:37:24] and you see it all the time
[1:37:27] and and now you see but
[1:37:31] it could have been prevented
[1:37:32] if you just had the right mindset about
[1:37:35] things you see
[1:37:36] praise god so it's so it's very
[1:37:38] important even to have
[1:37:40] the right goal the right uh
[1:37:44] bounds and the right boundaries even in
[1:37:47] those areas in our lives
[1:37:49] you see because you can't just let loose
[1:37:53] you can't just let loose and so don't
[1:37:55] get upset with your with your dad that
[1:37:56] says uh sweetheart listen i i don't i
[1:37:59] don't agree that you go that way why
[1:38:01] because he's looking ahead
[1:38:03] he
[1:38:04] you're looking at the moment the way i
[1:38:06] feel right now and it is and it just
[1:38:08] feels so good and it's all right but see
[1:38:10] we're looking ahead we're looking beyond
[1:38:12] the feeling
[1:38:14] right
[1:38:14] the feeling will lead to something later
[1:38:16] on that you
[1:38:18] will regret and you'll be like why did i
[1:38:19] even go there
[1:38:23] how did i even meet him
[1:38:25] why didn't i even meet her
[1:38:27] you
[1:38:28] see we we were trying to prevent that
[1:38:31] from
[1:38:33] and more
[1:38:34] and more for sure god god is trying to
[1:38:36] prevent that
[1:38:37] praise god
[1:38:39] all right
[1:38:40] so
[1:38:43] trying to move ahead here
[1:38:48] skipping all these things here
[1:38:51] all right so jeremiah 6 1 tells us it
[1:38:53] says also
[1:38:54] i set watchman over you
[1:38:58] right
[1:38:59] and
[1:39:00] saying hearken to the sound of the
[1:39:02] trumpet
[1:39:04] but israel said but they said we will
[1:39:06] not hearken
[1:39:08] so god's always placing watchmen god's
[1:39:12] always placing boundaries in our lives
[1:39:15] and let's not be like the children of
[1:39:18] israel are amen we will not listen
[1:39:20] we will not listen we will not hearken
[1:39:22] amen because
[1:39:23] i'm going to do my own thing
[1:39:25] well if you do your own thing you'll go
[1:39:27] you'll have your own reward
[1:39:29] that's what jesus said
[1:39:31] amen so god's placed watchmen over you
[1:39:34] the ministers the the pastor the
[1:39:36] the the different men in your life and
[1:39:39] and women in your life that will help
[1:39:40] lead and guide you
[1:39:42] young people don't be afraid to talk to
[1:39:44] your parents about certain things
[1:39:47] ask them questions
[1:39:48] amen they're we're we're here as
[1:39:51] boundaries for you
[1:39:53] we're not here to harm you or give you
[1:39:55] or or stop you from having fun in your
[1:39:57] life or no we're here to just be guides
[1:40:00] you see just like a a a guy for a river
[1:40:04] amen if if a person that needs to have a
[1:40:08] flow of water go this way where they got
[1:40:10] to have something there to stop that
[1:40:12] flow right here and make it go this way
[1:40:15] you see
[1:40:16] but the flow is still going it's just
[1:40:18] we're just guiding it you see
[1:40:20] amen and the holy spirit is guiding us
[1:40:22] amen so that we can guide you praise god
[1:40:24] amen
[1:40:26] boundaries usually have landmarks amen
[1:40:29] landmarks can be rivers hills trees or
[1:40:32] even man-made landmarks
[1:40:34] and what do you think our
[1:40:36] our landmark is
[1:40:38] what is our spiritual landmark
[1:40:41] amen this is the token
[1:40:43] which is the holy ghost
[1:40:45] amen the holy ghost is our landmine
[1:40:48] amen whatever the holy spirit says
[1:40:50] that's what we do
[1:40:52] amen that is uh that that is what guides
[1:40:54] our lives amen praise glory
[1:40:58] and you know what if you do away with
[1:40:59] that landmark
[1:41:01] amen
[1:41:03] if you do over that land work then
[1:41:04] you're then your boundaries are lost
[1:41:07] you see we when we have boundaries out
[1:41:10] here
[1:41:11] between for example two neighbors there
[1:41:14] is a landmark there there's maybe a
[1:41:15] little flag there or a little something
[1:41:18] to mark that that is your property and
[1:41:21] this is my problem
[1:41:22] you see
[1:41:23] and that is what the holy ghost is amen
[1:41:26] this marks
[1:41:28] amen that i am i belong to god and that
[1:41:31] is that is of satan and i don't belong
[1:41:33] to that you see
[1:41:34] the holy ghost is what makes the
[1:41:35] difference in your life
[1:41:37] that's why it's so important young
[1:41:38] people to make sure that you have the
[1:41:40] new birth in your life
[1:41:42] to make sure that you have the holy
[1:41:43] ghost and not just not just a feeling or
[1:41:45] not just a hunch
[1:41:47] that i think i have it or or that or
[1:41:49] that no now that you know that i have
[1:41:52] that
[1:41:53] that landmark in my life that i have a
[1:41:56] guide in my life that i have an absolute
[1:41:58] in my life make sure that you know
[1:42:02] don't just go by a hunch
[1:42:04] don't just go by by by uh or maybe you
[1:42:08] know i i i felt this or no it's not my
[1:42:11] feelings it do you have it the way the
[1:42:13] word of god says
[1:42:15] amen
[1:42:17] sure you may have a feeling that's good
[1:42:20] but don't
[1:42:21] don't put bank everything on the field
[1:42:24] amen
[1:42:25] bank it on
[1:42:26] is the word of god more interesting to
[1:42:28] you or not
[1:42:30] do you desire the word more
[1:42:32] do you desire even to come to church
[1:42:36] do you desire to even hang around with
[1:42:37] the right people
[1:42:40] right i know when i got saved and now
[1:42:43] when i became a christian i didn't want
[1:42:45] to do the things of the world anymore
[1:42:48] and my mom and dad didn't tell me to
[1:42:50] stop or my mom and dad didn't tell me to
[1:42:52] stop playing video games and and things
[1:42:54] like that it was something in me said i
[1:42:57] shouldn't be feeding on these things
[1:42:58] anymore
[1:43:00] and it made me want to seek the things
[1:43:03] from above
[1:43:05] and i i got around and i started giving
[1:43:07] out i've given this testimony before i
[1:43:09] used to love playing video games
[1:43:11] that's just what i love right now
[1:43:13] i still get around sometimes if i have
[1:43:15] time
[1:43:18] but i hardly don't have time anymore
[1:43:21] michael did me the other day he was over
[1:43:23] at our house and we got we got to play
[1:43:25] in some racing games
[1:43:27] like man
[1:43:29] i ain't done this in a while
[1:43:34] but you see
[1:43:36] there is a there's a time that
[1:43:38] you know there are certain things that i
[1:43:39] used to do that i just couldn't do
[1:43:41] anymore
[1:43:42] why because they were not feeding my
[1:43:43] soul
[1:43:45] they were actually vexing my soul
[1:43:48] right
[1:43:49] watching me chopping people's heads off
[1:43:51] and
[1:43:51] and and
[1:43:53] mutilating people and playing scary
[1:43:55] games with demons and things like that
[1:43:57] that's what i was into
[1:43:59] none of that helped me grow spiritually
[1:44:03] right so when i was giving out the video
[1:44:04] games to my friends really what i should
[1:44:06] have done is just threw them away but
[1:44:08] i was giving them out
[1:44:10] they're like man why are you giving this
[1:44:12] thing
[1:44:13] you know what it's like
[1:44:15] actually no i didn't give it i didn't
[1:44:16] give him i threw him away actually and
[1:44:18] so my friend one of my friends i even
[1:44:20] what gaming buddies i used to play with
[1:44:22] he's like man why don't you just give
[1:44:23] them to me
[1:44:25] and i told them i said listen man it's
[1:44:27] like
[1:44:28] me giving you poison
[1:44:30] taking my poison and just giving it to
[1:44:32] you
[1:44:33] i didn't feel right you see
[1:44:36] so there's got to be a change there's
[1:44:37] the the holy spirit amen puts boundaries
[1:44:40] in our lives amen
[1:44:42] praise god
[1:44:43] you can't be the same
[1:44:46] when you really receive an experience
[1:44:47] with god amen
[1:44:49] praise the lord jesus
[1:44:52] sometimes saints it's not about the
[1:44:54] enemy moving the landmarks but it's us
[1:44:56] moving those landmarks ourselves
[1:45:00] we put and blame everything on the devil
[1:45:02] but in reality we're the ones who move
[1:45:04] the landmarks
[1:45:06] we're the ones who are at fault you see
[1:45:08] praise god i know everybody's getting
[1:45:10] hot
[1:45:11] so we're trying to move along quickly
[1:45:14] and young people don't don't see how
[1:45:16] close you can get to the world
[1:45:18] hey man don't see how how how close i
[1:45:21] can get to the to the
[1:45:23] i'm still okay i'm still going to church
[1:45:25] i'm still hey man but but i'm just just
[1:45:28] walking barely rarely
[1:45:31] any little thing that happens in your
[1:45:32] life you're going down
[1:45:35] you see
[1:45:37] just teeter-tattering you know just that
[1:45:40] just a little bit of the world you know
[1:45:42] just to you know that's not how we we
[1:45:44] gotta we gotta run away from the world
[1:45:46] get as far away from it as possible
[1:45:50] so that people know where we stand
[1:45:53] right
[1:45:54] by the way you dress
[1:45:56] by the way you look by the way
[1:45:58] you you talk
[1:45:59] amen
[1:46:01] you can't just be walking
[1:46:03] and think that you won't fall
[1:46:06] if you're doing this you see people know
[1:46:09] if you're doing this tender tattering
[1:46:10] right next to the world but still got
[1:46:12] your foot over here on the things of god
[1:46:14] people can tell
[1:46:16] but people can see
[1:46:18] something's wrong with you spiritually
[1:46:20] and any little thing that will come in
[1:46:22] your life is gonna knock you over
[1:46:26] amen but what what a great thing it is
[1:46:28] to be able to walk
[1:46:30] firmly
[1:46:32] walking and not when i'm not
[1:46:33] teeter-tattering with the world
[1:46:35] just a little bit you know
[1:46:38] but walking firmly that's why god gave
[1:46:40] us two firm feet to walk on
[1:46:42] and god gave us two spiritual firm feet
[1:46:44] to welcome the old and new testament
[1:46:47] amen
[1:46:48] praise the lord jesus
[1:46:51] so don't let the bars down in your life
[1:46:53] young people
[1:46:55] hold fast to what you've scripturally
[1:46:56] been taught
[1:46:58] make sure you have an absolute
[1:47:01] so
[1:47:02] this one i want you to get in summary as
[1:47:04] christians we must we must establish
[1:47:06] healthy boundaries that are biblically
[1:47:08] based
[1:47:09] amen
[1:47:12] boundaries
[1:47:13] activate
[1:47:15] the promises of god in our life
[1:47:18] how many believe that
[1:47:20] amen they they activate the promises of
[1:47:23] god
[1:47:24] in our life boundaries promote true
[1:47:26] freedom
[1:47:28] boundaries are not there to tie you up
[1:47:30] bound you up they promote true freedom
[1:47:34] while some things may be lawful for you
[1:47:36] not all things are beneficial for you
[1:47:39] you see
[1:47:41] praise the lord
[1:47:43] so i want you to think about these
[1:47:44] questions
[1:47:45] what is the landmark that you have moved
[1:47:47] in your life that has taken you out of
[1:47:49] the spiritual boundaries
[1:47:52] what is that landmark only you know that
[1:47:55] is it prayer
[1:47:57] man is it going to church
[1:47:59] is it reading meditating on the word of
[1:48:01] god
[1:48:02] amen what is it
[1:48:04] what is it that you're not doing again
[1:48:06] that you used to do when you had that
[1:48:08] real close relationship with god
[1:48:12] amen because brother brennan told the
[1:48:14] story he said wherever you left christ
[1:48:16] that's where you'll find him again
[1:48:18] he's there waiting for you again
[1:48:20] wherever you left him that's where
[1:48:21] you'll find him he has not moved you're
[1:48:24] the one that moved he's still there
[1:48:26] extended hands waiting for you
[1:48:29] amen is it reading studying god's word
[1:48:31] get to reading and study praise god is
[1:48:34] it how you treat others
[1:48:36] start treating others with respect and
[1:48:38] kindness
[1:48:39] treat them the way you want to be
[1:48:41] treated
[1:48:42] right
[1:48:43] is it coming to church then start coming
[1:48:46] to church if you are not consistently
[1:48:49] right
[1:48:51] i want to finish with this i want us to
[1:48:53] set our eyes on reading the first verse
[1:48:56] that we that we started with in
[1:48:57] colossians 3 2 set your affections on
[1:49:00] things above and not on things of this
[1:49:03] earth
[1:49:04] praise the lord
[1:49:07] brother christian i want you to help me
[1:49:09] with this example here
[1:49:16] oh yeah we brought out the tools
[1:49:20] we brought up the the cute
[1:49:31] all right
[1:49:32] remember what we just read
[1:49:34] we just read
[1:49:35] in paul told us set your affection on
[1:49:39] things above
[1:49:40] are the things above temporary are they
[1:49:42] eternal
[1:49:45] they're eternal right
[1:49:47] and he says here not on things on the
[1:49:50] earth
[1:49:51] are the things of the earth eternal
[1:49:53] or
[1:49:54] temporal they are tempered they won't
[1:49:57] last they will burn up
[1:49:59] amen but the things of god will always
[1:50:02] be
[1:50:02] amen
[1:50:04] so i have this rope right here
[1:50:08] amen i want us to thank
[1:50:11] brother christian said that this rope
[1:50:12] was about 12 feet we cut a little piece
[1:50:15] yesterday to make sure this is going to
[1:50:16] work
[1:50:18] now a rope you can use it as as a
[1:50:21] as a boundary too you see you can use a
[1:50:24] rope to to to
[1:50:26] you know for boundaries and for look at
[1:50:28] that i'm making it look like a snake
[1:50:32] that was pretty cool
[1:50:35] all right
[1:50:36] but i want us to think about this young
[1:50:38] people adults too
[1:50:39] because sometimes we just get carried
[1:50:41] away with the things of this life too
[1:50:42] much
[1:50:43] i include myself
[1:50:47] this right here
[1:50:48] this right here represents our life
[1:50:52] this little piece right here
[1:50:55] you have this whole thing right
[1:50:57] and this little piece right here
[1:51:00] from here
[1:51:01] to the end
[1:51:03] is our life
[1:51:06] is our life here on earth
[1:51:08] right
[1:51:10] but some of us we fixate more on this
[1:51:14] little piece
[1:51:15] and you forget about the rest of
[1:51:17] eternity that is ahead of you
[1:51:20] look look how long that rope is
[1:51:22] but you're only thinking about this
[1:51:24] little piece
[1:51:25] in your life
[1:51:27] right and at any moment god will come in
[1:51:31] and cut that piece
[1:51:33] right go ahead
[1:51:41] this represents death
[1:51:45] this is all that you have left this is
[1:51:48] what you were concentrating on
[1:51:52] which is time here on earth
[1:51:54] this little piece on earth and you
[1:51:56] forget what lies ahead
[1:51:59] this whole thing
[1:52:01] lies ahead
[1:52:04] what would you prefer
[1:52:06] the short piece
[1:52:08] or the or the long piece the the thing
[1:52:11] that will that that's longer that that
[1:52:13] lasts that's eternal
[1:52:15] i mean i i want the longer peace
[1:52:17] thank you brother christian give him a
[1:52:19] clap of praise
[1:52:20] [Applause]
[1:52:23] don't fixate on this
[1:52:25] fixate on the eternal things that's why
[1:52:27] paul said don't look at the things look
[1:52:30] at the things above
[1:52:32] and not the things of this earth
[1:52:36] right because this is going to end
[1:52:38] one day death will come and cut you off
[1:52:42] death will come none of us are exempt
[1:52:45] from it
[1:52:46] it will come
[1:52:48] we don't know when we don't know how but
[1:52:50] it will happen we trust that each and
[1:52:52] every one of us who have the holy ghost
[1:52:53] we're going in a rapture
[1:52:55] right
[1:52:57] amen but while we're here on this earth
[1:52:59] amen we're not promised tomorrow
[1:53:02] so don't think about today
[1:53:05] think about
[1:53:06] eternity that's why paul said set your
[1:53:09] affections on things above
[1:53:11] and not the things of this world
[1:53:14] amen
[1:53:15] so i hope i hope that that helps
[1:53:17] amen to keep boundaries in your life
[1:53:20] it's very important and don't get upset
[1:53:22] with the parent just trying to
[1:53:24] make sure that you stay by those
[1:53:25] boundaries don't get upset with the
[1:53:26] preacher that's preaching and trying so
[1:53:28] that you can stay by those boundaries
[1:53:31] amen because it is the holy ghost
[1:53:33] speaking if it's according to the word
[1:53:35] of god if he's speaking according to the
[1:53:38] word or if your parents are speaking
[1:53:40] according to the word don't get upset
[1:53:42] say lord let me analyze this let me
[1:53:45] think and be prayerful about it god will
[1:53:47] direct you
[1:53:48] exactly where you need to go praise god

[1:54:24] because they're going to get their own
[1:54:26] but if god gives it to you you're not
[1:54:28] going to get thrown around
[1:54:31] when god does his work amen that it's
[1:54:33] done right thank you thank you
