[1:38] about what we've been studying them so
[1:39] far in 70 weeks a day
[1:42] any question doesn't matter how small or
[1:44] how large
[1:46] please
[1:47] jot them down
[1:48] and we'll try to answer them
[1:50] because sometimes you have questions and

[1:57] you need to have the answer now the

[2:09] cover them but today we're going to
[2:12] go to daniel 9 24 we're going to read
[2:14] this
[2:16] all right and then we're going to go
[2:17] over and read daniel 12
[2:20] or maybe even 11 and 12 we're just going
[2:22] to read it and make a few comments on it
[2:24] because i want to put that seed in your
[2:25] mind
[2:27] so that you can chew on it for a couple
[2:28] weeks 70 weeks are determined upon thy
[2:31] people and upon the holy city the jews
[2:34] in jerusalem all right we're talking
[2:35] about i want you to how many times have
[2:37] i told you this is a two-part
[2:40] this is a two-part meaning here
[2:43] one for the people and one for the city
[2:45] so god has to restore not only people
[2:48] but the city because jerusalem is the
[2:50] holy city
[2:52] now you and i don't have a a con i could
[2:54] our city is not continuing down here
[2:57] remember the bible says we have no
[2:58] continuing seated down here we have one
[3:01] what in glory
[3:02] but it's actually inside of us the
[3:04] gentiles
[3:05] but god promised the jews that they
[3:07] would have a city to go to i don't know
[3:09] what temple to go to all right
[3:11] so whatever has been destroyed what does
[3:13] redemption do redemption brings it back
[3:16] all right yeah 70 weeks are determined
[3:18] upon thy people and upon the holy city
[3:21] to do six things finish the
[3:22] transgression make an end of sins
[3:25] by reconciliation for iniquity bringing
[3:27] everlasting righteousness seal up the
[3:28] business into prophecy and anoint the
[3:30] most holy
[3:32] now that's got to be done
[3:34] inside of 490 years right
[3:37] correct that's got to be finished
[3:40] that in the city has to be finished in
[3:43] 490 years
[3:46] that's what we're we're trying to get to
[3:47] me that's the bottom line the bible's
[3:49] telling us there's 490 years for the
[3:52] restoration of israel and the city
[3:55] that's exactly what that says and it
[3:57] tells you how
[3:58] all right and this is how
[4:00] know therefore and understand that from
[4:02] the going forth of the commandment to
[4:04] restore and to build jerusalem
[4:07] the old jerusalem unto the messiah the
[4:08] prince should be seven weeks
[4:12] three score in two weeks what 62 plus
[4:14] seven how many times we've been over
[4:16] there six two and seven
[4:17] 69
[4:19] 69
[4:20] right
[4:21] the streets shall be built again the
[4:23] wall even troubles time so starting at a
[4:25] point
[4:26] we found the point 445 bc
[4:31] when israel began to come back as a
[4:32] nation when israel
[4:34] rebuilt the city tabernacle
[4:37] they rebuilt the walls and
[4:40] brought the people back in
[4:42] all right right remember the 445 bc
[4:45] nehemiah bringing in the edict to come
[4:48] in and restore
[4:49] and then they went all these years
[4:52] until who
[4:53] and to the messiah the prince which is
[4:56] who jesus christ the son of man
[4:59] all right yes
[5:01] and after 62 weeks and after this period
[5:04] right here
[5:06] shall messiah be cut off but not for
[5:08] himself now
[5:10] let's stop right here just for a minute
[5:11] because this is where some people in the
[5:13] message contend that's it that word says
[5:16] after three score in two weeks
[5:19] that means that jesus
[5:21] when he started preaching his strength
[5:23] after your ministry
[5:24] that ended the 62 weeks that's not what
[5:27] the bible said
[5:28] the bible says after three score in two
[5:30] weeks he'll be cut off
[5:32] killed that word cut off if you look it
[5:35] up it means
[5:36] killed he wasn't killed
[5:39] at start of his ministry he was killed
[5:40] at the end of his ministry
[5:43] okay
[5:44] but see to prove their point to get
[5:46] those other to get to three and a half
[5:47] years over here
[5:50] that they say is the 70 is this part
[5:52] right here in the 70 week
[5:54] they have to put it back over here so
[5:55] that says after
[5:57] now i want you to understand something
[6:00] after three score two weeks
[6:02] we'll read it a couple of sundays we'll
[6:04] get back into the quotes but brother
[6:05] brown was so specific he said
[6:08] april the 2nd
[6:10] 80 30
[6:11] jesus rode into
[6:13] jerusalem on a white donkey
[6:16] palm sunday 80 30. what is palm sunday
[6:19] the sunday before easter
[6:23] okay
[6:23] when was he killed
[6:25] the friday before easter
[6:29] when he rode into jerusalem
[6:33] he was
[6:34] at that moment they said oh hold on to
[6:36] the highest king king three days later
[6:38] they killed him
[6:40] the same people
[6:42] the jews they were the ones that were
[6:44] late i was reading it yesterday in luke
[6:47] they were laying the palm trees down
[6:48] they were saying hosanna to the king you
[6:50] know hosanna hosanna he's come in the
[6:53] name of the lord
[6:55] them same people four days later from
[6:57] sunday
[6:58] monday tuesday wednesday thursday
[7:01] friday afternoon he was dead and they
[7:03] killed him they were jews
[7:05] all right so they cut him off
[7:08] so you know exactly when the 62 weeks
[7:10] was cut off was after april the 9th 1830
[7:14] after yeah
[7:16] and that was my contestant i said look
[7:18] after me what is tomorrow
[7:20] the day after today only one day it only
[7:22] has to be one day to be after
[7:25] right
[7:25] if you go to walmart tomorrow
[7:29] then
[7:30] what's the next day it's after the day
[7:32] you went
[7:33] so you know they were going after three
[7:36] score in two weeks
[7:37] that there's that he's began his
[7:39] ministry well
[7:40] that's not even the bible
[7:42] the bible said he was cut off
[7:45] killed
[7:47] in april of 80 30. right according to
[7:50] the prophet according to the according
[7:52] our timeline remember
[7:54] we proved it was 80
[7:56] 30. anybody okay with that
[7:59] yeah and after three score in two weeks
[8:02] shall we be cut off absolutely right
[8:04] there
[8:05] he was cut off days after that 62 weeks
[8:08] was over
[8:10] right
[8:11] he was killed
[8:14] that's why i believe brother brown
[8:15] brought the brought the uh do i just
[8:17] common sense yes common sense but see to
[8:20] but look remember
[8:21] revelation is easy when you try when you
[8:23] bring a false doctrine then you've got
[8:25] to bring all the you got to bring all
[8:26] the other things
[8:28] to prove
[8:30] see because their whole contention was
[8:31] buddy i mean stop foot stomping
[8:33] contention was that there's only three
[8:35] and a half years left
[8:37] of the 70 weeks of daniel after the
[8:39] rapture
[8:41] it's not true can't be true according to
[8:43] the bible according to prophet's message
[8:44] cannot be true
[8:46] right
[8:47] right he said it was one week
[8:50] one week left
[8:51] after the rapture
[8:53] the bible shows you there's one week
[8:54] left because if 69 weeks is already
[8:57] finished
[8:58] how many more weeks are we looking for
[9:01] what
[9:02] one week
[9:03] we're not looking for a half week
[9:04] there's no half weeks in the bible
[9:06] except when it says time times and the
[9:08] dividing of time which would be a half
[9:10] half of a week or what three and a half
[9:12] years
[9:14] so after three score in two weeks shall
[9:16] musa be cut off he was killed
[9:19] and the dates up and after 80 april 2nd
[9:22] 80 30 he was he was dead right
[9:28] but not for himself
[9:29] he didn't die for himself
[9:31] he died for me
[9:34] and the people of the prince that say
[9:36] look now you gotta look you gotta pause
[9:39] and the people of the prince that shall
[9:40] come
[9:42] watch where i'm pointing
[9:44] who's the prince that was to come
[9:46] titus
[9:48] little pete the prince that shall come
[9:51] shall destroy the city in 1870
[9:54] that's when titus came in and utterly
[9:56] there's that's why jesus they told him i
[9:58] was reading that too yesterday where
[10:00] if you're reading in your gospels you
[10:01] read about daniel sandy weeks it's all
[10:03] in the for gospel
[10:05] jesus tells you about the whole thing he
[10:06] said
[10:08] there won't be one stone left you know
[10:10] they took him out that show they said
[10:11] look at these great buildings he said
[10:13] there'll be a time when there won't be
[10:14] one stone left on another well you know
[10:15] what it was okay titus utterly destroyed
[10:19] the temple and there wasn't one stone
[10:20] they couldn't even find the temple where
[10:22] it used to be that's right
[10:23] they just now started to find you know
[10:26] drawings to show them exactly where it
[10:28] was at
[10:29] but as far as seeing the temple
[10:31] titus the prince that shall come what
[10:34] was jesus doing jesus was fulfilling
[10:36] scripture
[10:37] everything he said fulfilled scripture
[10:42] i believe
[10:43] yeah i hope it was
[10:45] because that's what he's talking about
[10:46] he said in in matthew um
[10:49] um
[10:51] jeez my brain just went blank between 24
[10:54] because he is scripture right matthew 24
[10:57] he says when you see the abomination
[11:00] that maketh desolate standing in the
[11:02] temple we'll see that's a two-part thing
[11:05] right here it happened one time
[11:07] titus a roman general
[11:09] was standing in the temple
[11:11] okay get away with it and then who put
[11:14] who built on top of it the mosque of
[11:16] omar
[11:18] right
[11:18] so that's the desecration of a temple
[11:21] but remember one thing's for sure
[11:24] that temple is not the problem
[11:29] buildings are not the problem
[11:31] it's the people that go in the buildings
[11:34] or the problem
[11:36] so the the the abomination that makes
[11:38] desolation
[11:40] is not the building
[11:43] it's when the antichrist walks in and
[11:45] says i'm god and this is my building
[11:49] all right
[11:51] all right so
[11:53] the people of the prince that shall come
[11:54] shall destroy the city titus did in 80
[11:57] 70.
[11:58] and the sanctuary so they tore
[12:00] everything down
[12:01] so now if he tore everything down and 70
[12:05] weeks is a restoration
[12:06] message let's just call it that 70 weeks
[12:09] is a restoration message he's got to
[12:11] restore the people and the and the
[12:13] temple and the sanctuary
[12:16] and the end there shall be with the
[12:17] flood remember they opened the gates and
[12:19] they said the blood just run out like
[12:20] water
[12:21] and to the end of the war desolations
[12:24] are determined now show me
[12:27] where
[12:30] it's ever come back
[12:32] there's still no temple over there
[12:34] correct it's been 2 000 years
[12:36] and there's still no temple over there
[12:39] okay that's what they're waiting on all
[12:41] right
[12:43] and he that's a period so now that's
[12:45] gonna happen in here we know the messiah
[12:48] was cut off after 62 weeks
[12:50] so what 62.7 again
[12:53] so how much how many years we got to do
[12:55] 70 weeks they're determined so that 69
[12:58] weeks already happened so there's one
[12:59] week left
[13:01] for the jews to rebuild themselves
[13:05] and the temple
[13:06] you got two things you gotta do right
[13:09] and to me i'll show you where that split
[13:11] is right here
[13:12] that everybody can't see
[13:15] that the people get redeemed the first
[13:16] three and a half years and the city gets
[13:18] redeemed to last three and a half years
[13:22] is that all right
[13:25] right because the city the battle of
[13:26] armageddon's right here they can't build
[13:28] a city and then the battle of armageddon
[13:29] happened and destroy everything that's
[13:31] right that's not a restoration that's
[13:32] why i said everybody in the message says
[13:34] it's all got to happen right there and
[13:36] there's no way
[13:38] there's no way scripture can be
[13:39] fulfilled in that 1260 days
[13:43] right
[13:45] because in the message this is what the
[13:46] people say after the rapture there's
[13:48] only 1260 days left of the 70 weeks of
[13:52] daniel
[13:54] they're about that far from being close
[13:56] to being right
[13:58] there's only 1260 days for the
[13:59] redemption of the people of israel
[14:02] but what about the city
[14:06] what about the city
[14:08] because right here definitely
[14:10] after this is the battle of armageddon
[14:13] now everybody tell you that even even
[14:15] the
[14:16] denominational world will tell you that
[14:17] bible armageddon is going to happen
[14:19] after them two prophets are killed
[14:22] the bible says all heck breaks loose in
[14:23] other words in southern language
[14:26] everything's destroyed well you can't
[14:29] you can't build a temple here and
[14:30] destroy it and then build it again
[14:32] it doesn't say that
[14:34] it's just in 70 weeks
[14:37] the building and the people will be
[14:38] restored that's right so if the 70 weeks
[14:41] ends right here then the bible's wrong
[14:42] and the prophet's wrong so the bible's
[14:44] not wrong the problem's not wrong
[14:46] is that right
[14:47] okay all right so let's keep reading
[14:50] and he shall confirm the covenant with
[14:51] many for one week now who's that little
[14:53] age
[14:55] that's the antichrist
[14:57] because god doesn't make a covenant and
[14:59] then break it that's true
[15:02] god makes the covenant of this forever
[15:04] all right
[15:05] so satan confirms the covenant with me
[15:07] for one week right here
[15:10] one week got it
[15:13] one week right
[15:15] now when he makes that covenant we are
[15:17] not here when that covenant's made
[15:20] now the prophet of god tells us many
[15:22] times right we're not here when he makes
[15:25] that covenant with the jew so now if
[15:27] we're not here
[15:29] and that word right there says
[15:32] week one week
[15:34] then there should be one week left after
[15:36] the rapture
[15:38] right yes kind of kind of too simple
[15:42] that's why i said revelation is simple
[15:45] false doctrine it's complicated right
[15:47] because you have to complicate things
[15:49] you have to add this and bring this in
[15:50] and make this fit and make that fit and
[15:53] lord you aren't seeing them still a few
[15:54] lies you're seeing them stinking charts
[15:56] at them
[15:58] i'm telling you they were stinking
[15:59] charts because they were written so much
[16:01] way out of the scripture
[16:03] didn't even take the one the prophet
[16:05] drew
[16:06] kind of sad when you got you know
[16:09] 30 preachers in a building and
[16:12] 25 of them has never seen that chart
[16:15] that brother branham drew
[16:17] of the 70 weeks you know the original
[16:19] chart that he
[16:21] didn't built
[16:21] have a clue had never even seen it knew
[16:23] there was one one circulating but
[16:28] but anyway
[16:30] i don't want to be contentious but i
[16:32] want to tell you i want to be like
[16:33] arenas
[16:35] i don't have nothing to do with them
[16:36] people if they won't take truth i don't
[16:38] have nothing to do with them
[16:40] that's why irena said he's only we
[16:42] caught the same house for the guy yeah
[16:44] right
[16:45] yes remember we were talking about
[16:48] because you know what you hang around
[16:50] false doctrine long enough and it might
[16:51] just get off on you that's true
[16:53] so let's just try to stay up abstain
[16:56] from those things
[16:57] and he shall confirm the covenant with
[16:59] many for one week many now remember we
[17:02] talked about this specifically to the
[17:05] jews but it's going to be to the whole
[17:06] world
[17:09] now the bible in what is it timothy
[17:10] where it says peace peace then sudden
[17:12] destruction
[17:15] that's why i want to tell you something
[17:17] about this election coming up
[17:19] let's not be so ignorant about this
[17:22] election coming up
[17:24] what if we get a present because
[17:25] remember
[17:27] and it's got something to do with this
[17:29] or i wouldn't say it
[17:30] but remember we have to be the image to
[17:33] the beast i say we i'm talking about the
[17:35] united states of america now right now
[17:37] we are no military power because of the
[17:39] last president destroyed the military
[17:41] power all right so we have no military
[17:43] might in the world we're laughed at now
[17:46] right right
[17:48] we got to be the image we got to be the
[17:49] image to the beast when he speaks we
[17:51] speak the united states right what said
[17:53] revelation 13. so everybody's thinking
[17:56] now that there's somebody got to come in
[17:57] to make this thing go down no don't
[18:00] think that way
[18:02] the bible says craft will prosper that's
[18:04] right things will prosper
[18:07] right
[18:08] so what about a president that comes in
[18:10] here and builds the economy up
[18:12] gets our war power back up
[18:15] and then what happens in the next three
[18:17] or four years
[18:19] right
[18:20] listen
[18:22] if the stock market's doing like it's
[18:23] doing now just kind of up and down like
[18:25] this that's not a crash
[18:27] right right and you know what if you
[18:29] fall about two feet off of a ledge
[18:30] that's not a crash right but if you fall
[18:33] a hundred feet off of a ledge that's a
[18:34] crash yeah so let's don't think
[18:36] everybody think well hillary we gotta
[18:38] have a woman in the white house
[18:41] all tonight let's watch and see
[18:44] we need somebody in america to build
[18:45] everything back up
[18:48] so trump may not be too far off
[18:51] we need somebody to build this thing
[18:52] back up that final trunk that's right
[18:56] [Laughter]
[19:06] that might be the reason why his last
[19:08] name is jerome
[19:11] but you understand what i'm saying i
[19:12] mean we've got to build our our might
[19:13] has be has got to be built back up
[19:16] i was thinking about this other day the
[19:17] bible even tells us that we as the
[19:19] united states has to be this
[19:22] the brother says the beast is speaking
[19:24] somebody's got to back it up we can't
[19:26] back it up now because we have no
[19:27] military power but
[19:30] the way to get the economy back up is to
[19:32] start a war
[19:33] that's right
[19:34] the war is a very uh war it's very
[19:37] profitable very proud
[19:38] very profitable so
[19:41] so you know let's just think of it as
[19:44] as if trump gets in then he's going to
[19:46] help get what's going on what's going on
[19:49] so
[19:50] but remember you've got to come and
[19:51] build it to a place though that when it
[19:53] does fall then the pope comes in and
[19:55] confirms the covenant with many it'll be
[19:58] the united states and all the people in
[19:59] the u.n
[20:00] will be um affected by this covenant
[20:04] not just the jews
[20:07] okay
[20:08] but that covenant is for one week
[20:12] because it coincides with israel's 1260
[20:15] days that the two witnesses
[20:18] are going to prophesy according to
[20:21] revelations 11 right okay so a lot and
[20:24] in the midst of the week what's the
[20:25] midst of a week
[20:27] three and a half
[20:29] when the midst of seven is three and a
[20:30] half right
[20:31] and after three and a half years
[20:34] he shall cause the
[20:36] sacrifice of oblation to cease
[20:39] and for the over spreading of
[20:40] abominations he shall make it desolate
[20:43] what is abomination
[20:45] he's going to walk into the temple that
[20:46] they've set up
[20:48] for temple worship and tell them hey
[20:52] i'm gone
[20:54] i'm the one you need to listen to and
[20:55] you know what he will have signs and
[20:57] wonders
[20:59] amen
[21:00] look at janice and jammers when moses
[21:02] came on the scene when these two when
[21:03] these two prophets come on the scene
[21:05] don't you think the devil's going to be
[21:06] silent go hide somewhere
[21:08] no
[21:09] it's going to be them two spirits the
[21:10] same way all the way through
[21:13] they'll do something and somebody else
[21:15] will do something and finally
[21:16] the bible says after 1260 days
[21:21] and in the midst of the week that's when
[21:23] the 1260 days is going to be finished
[21:25] because 1260 is what
[21:28] half of a week three and a half years of
[21:31] prophetic calendar week right
[21:34] just trying to refresh your memory we've
[21:35] been all over this before but sometimes
[21:37] you know
[21:38] we get all these details but let's just
[21:40] kind of push all the dates aside and
[21:41] push all that and just really look at
[21:43] what the bible says
[21:45] and for the overspreading of
[21:46] abominations
[21:48] he shall make it desolate
[21:50] even until the consummation what does
[21:52] that word consummation mean
[22:01] completion
[22:03] completion of what that's 70 weeks
[22:07] see our completion is right here
[22:10] we get a body change we go on a rapture
[22:12] we're finished you don't have to go to
[22:14] watch on judgment there's no other
[22:16] position that you and i as the bride
[22:19] have to come to
[22:20] pass right here
[22:22] is that right
[22:24] we're done when we take a body change
[22:26] and we go up in another dimension
[22:30] we're finished there's no other
[22:31] redemption for us
[22:33] we don't have to stand at the white
[22:35] throne judgment sure we have to give
[22:36] account of the little things we talked
[22:37] about that in the bible study
[22:39] but as far as
[22:42] anything extra no we're done we're
[22:44] complete
[22:45] now but is israel complete at this point
[22:48] right here no they're actually just
[22:49] getting started
[22:51] okay for their 1260 days they're getting
[22:54] started and here they come to a point
[22:56] till their redemption finish
[22:59] they take a rapture
[23:01] okay
[23:03] but remember what else is left
[23:07] the city
[23:08] the city the temple the tabernacle
[23:12] has got to be completed somewhere
[23:14] because look
[23:16] completion termination full in complete
[23:19] disruption
[23:20] consumption annihilation
[23:23] that's what that word
[23:25] and he shall make it desolate even until
[23:27] the consummation and that determined
[23:29] shall be poured out
[23:31] upon
[23:33] and remember what desolate means
[23:38] stupefy
[23:40] to be desolated deserted
[23:44] to be all struck
[23:47] they're going to be it right here but i
[23:49] see
[23:51] right here is brother brown called the
[23:53] determination of forces
[23:55] that's mankind
[23:57] okay down here mankind
[24:00] see i've always said that here the
[24:02] battle of armageddon is a nuclear
[24:04] disaster right because the bible tells
[24:05] us that man will stand on earth and the
[24:07] flesh will fall off of them that's
[24:09] nuclear fallout right
[24:11] so
[24:13] i don't think that
[24:14] this battle of armageddon is not going
[24:16] to be a one day
[24:17] war
[24:21] might be fast but not one right you
[24:23] can't kill everybody on this face this
[24:25] earth at one time with just atomic bomb
[24:29] they're gonna have to die of other
[24:30] things nuclear fallout they can't eat
[24:33] anything it's gonna be horrible but they
[24:35] are gonna die so there's a little time
[24:37] in there maybe
[24:38] maybe six months maybe whatever
[24:41] but the bible's got to be fulfilled that
[24:43] their skin falls off their body so
[24:44] somebody's gonna have to make it through
[24:46] there
[24:47] you know the very initial battle
[24:50] and then die because they were brothers
[24:52] and everybody dies before the millennium
[24:54] so
[24:55] yeah
[24:56] that first week there on over here
[24:59] all of the uh that's going to be
[25:02] tribulation for the people over here
[25:05] right
[25:06] the other side of that well right here
[25:08] it's going to be not the great
[25:09] tribulation it's going to be tribulation
[25:11] yeah okay
[25:12] the great tribulation's about the war
[25:13] we're getting because even brother brown
[25:14] puts that on it but there's a
[25:16] tribulation period of three and a half
[25:17] years
[25:19] that's going to go on around the world
[25:21] because remember
[25:23] there's one thing for sure right in here
[25:24] somewhere there's going to be an
[25:25] earthquake
[25:27] that's going to devastate the united
[25:28] states of america
[25:31] that's why i'm telling you we've got to
[25:33] be built up as an army before that
[25:37] before that earthquake happens
[25:39] because once that earthquake happens
[25:41] we as a nation are destroyed
[25:43] and we can't speak for nobody that's why
[25:45] he's got to come in and make a covenant
[25:48] keep everybody away from the united
[25:49] states and then let them build back up
[25:50] or whatever happens it doesn't really
[25:52] matter what i want to do is make sure
[25:54] that we know that there's things going
[25:56] on in this week that you can't just say
[25:57] well there's only 1260 days
[26:00] left
[26:01] of the 70 weeks of daniel because you've
[26:04] got a lot to do in 1260 days
[26:07] it's really a short period of time when
[26:09] you bring in 144 000 people in all right
[26:14] so he shall confirm the covenant with
[26:16] many for one week
[26:18] and in the midst of the week he shall
[26:19] cause to sacrifice an oblation to cease
[26:23] and for the overspreading of
[26:24] abominations he shall make it desolate
[26:26] even until the consummation
[26:28] what the end
[26:31] and that determined shall be poured
[26:34] upon the desolate so
[26:37] see that scripture right there covers
[26:38] from right here
[26:41] it covers
[26:42] 483 years
[26:44] [Music]
[26:46] 2 000 years average just say 2 000
[26:50] and know seven years
[26:53] okay
[26:54] that whole scripture covers from right
[26:56] here to right here
[26:58] now what we have to do is place it right
[27:01] it's like a puzzle that's got pieces
[27:03] missing out of it we gotta place it now
[27:05] we have placed i believe we placed all
[27:07] the puzzles up to right here
[27:09] [Music]
[27:10] even really to right here
[27:13] we placed all the pieces what's going to
[27:15] happen according to the bible
[27:17] all the way up through there now let's
[27:20] go to daniel
[27:21] excuse me
[27:22] daniel
[27:24] where'd you keep going yeah
[27:26] go ahead keep going
[27:29] yeah
[27:30] would you say okay when the
[27:31] tribulation's going up there's other
[27:32] stuff's gonna be going on now and that
[27:34] and the other people gonna be involved
[27:35] because that's what my family gonna be
[27:37] picked up the ones that i'm praying for
[27:38] that's come they're gonna have to go
[27:39] through the tribulation they're gonna
[27:40] have to be killed in this 1200 seats
[27:42] today and they're gonna do the
[27:43] tribulation but they're called well
[27:45] they're gonna be killed okay
[27:48] they're gonna be killed for the gospel
[27:49] that 1260 days
[27:52] well let's just be honest america is
[27:53] going to be desolated so there are going
[27:55] to be people going to come in and help
[27:57] us
[28:00] i mean i don't think brother brown said
[28:01] the russians would come into our streets
[28:03] and ravage our children and our and our
[28:05] wives right i don't think he's talking
[28:06] about us when he said to us he's talking
[28:09] about the united states right
[28:10] because you and i are not going to see
[28:11] that they're in tribulation yeah you and
[28:13] i are not going to say that that's not
[28:14] going to happen before the rapture
[28:16] that's going to be an after rapture
[28:18] event
[28:19] because remember the only two people
[28:20] that's got the holy ghost when that
[28:22] rapture takes place the only two people
[28:23] got holy ghost is two prophets
[28:25] on the whole entire earth
[28:28] two people
[28:30] now sure he brings in 144 000 along the
[28:33] way
[28:34] but when we go in the rapture there's
[28:35] two people that's got the holy ghost
[28:37] everybody else has not got it
[28:43] they'll be hunted down for the gospel
[28:45] that they believe and can't get it no no
[28:48] there's no way for a gentile to get the
[28:49] holy ghost in that right there's only
[28:51] 144 000 the only ones that can get the
[28:53] holy ghost
[28:54] in that period of time
[28:56] that lose anybody everybody okay with
[28:58] that so far
[29:00] when we go in the rapture there's no
[29:02] redemption for anyone except for two
[29:04] prophets and 144 000.
[29:07] now there will be the foolish virgin
[29:09] that's why the bible talks about the
[29:10] wise virgin going in the rapture or
[29:12] leaving rogerson comes takes them away
[29:15] foolish version of the left for the
[29:16] wailing and gnashing of teeth
[29:19] that's the people that we praying for
[29:21] that don't get the holy ghost
[29:23] that but but get sanctified gives their
[29:26] life for the gospel they'll be given
[29:28] eternal life but you know what the dead
[29:30] lived not
[29:32] the bible is real plain but you got to
[29:34] bring it all together the dead lived not
[29:36] for a thousand years
[29:38] anybody that's killed right here
[29:41] other than jews
[29:44] are gonna have to stay dead for a
[29:45] thousand years oh okay
[29:47] they don't come up until they walk on
[29:49] judgment watch on jackson way over here
[29:51] we got a long time before the real end
[29:53] time that's right i mean really there's
[29:55] a long time before the end time
[29:57] if the rapture took place today there's
[29:59] there's seven more years
[30:03] and then another thousand years
[30:05] before
[30:06] we come over to the white throne
[30:07] judgment so there's a long time until
[30:09] what men say is the end time will we
[30:12] stand before god and all those things
[30:15] long time
[30:16] but mine and your redemption is finished
[30:18] here that's why we have no time period
[30:20] we have no set day no time no season
[30:24] right when we're going to rapture we're
[30:25] done we're finished that's right we
[30:27] don't stand in judgment all we do is
[30:29] come back in here around in here we're
[30:30] going to come back and we're going to
[30:32] live a thousand years on the earth
[30:34] and i don't believe the earth is going
[30:36] to be like what we think the earth is
[30:38] going to be
[30:39] because the battle of armageddon is a
[30:41] natural battle
[30:45] structures of things will still be here
[30:48] okay just kills men kills people
[30:52] now the battle of gog and magog when god
[30:54] rains fire on the earth he's going to
[30:56] wipe her down to ashes again and then
[30:58] he's going to put a city down because
[31:00] remember in the millennium we're going
[31:01] to read it
[31:02] when we start reading scripture we're
[31:03] going to read that they will build
[31:05] houses
[31:06] you say how in the world are they going
[31:07] to be houses i don't care the bible says
[31:09] we're going to be allowed
[31:11] and inhabit them okay
[31:14] i don't think maybe we have to do that
[31:16] but there's other people that will build
[31:18] houses
[31:20] okay because i think we're pretty much
[31:21] finished
[31:22] for me brother brown said we're here on
[31:24] a honeymoon
[31:25] right yeah
[31:27] we're actually here to fulfill scripture
[31:30] okay because we got to fulfill this part
[31:32] right here
[31:33] number six
[31:34] right we have a connection with that
[31:36] number six
[31:37] the prophet of god told us we have a
[31:38] connection as as the bride of jesus
[31:41] christ we have a connection with the
[31:42] north the most holy
[31:45] because that anointing is us
[31:51] the temple's not but that anointing is
[31:53] us
[31:54] that's us coming back into the
[31:56] millennium in revelations 19. remember i
[31:59] told y'all about that the other day in
[32:00] 1921 us riding back in the millennium to
[32:03] inhabit a temple
[32:06] we walk out on the ashes of the wicked
[32:09] it's an atomic
[32:11] destruction
[32:12] so buildings buildings would be gone is
[32:14] that why we don't need a house
[32:18] but they they do the buildings to me i
[32:20] believe
[32:21] when we come back in the millennium
[32:24] we could see the structure of this
[32:26] of this building that doesn't all burn
[32:28] what i'm saying is it
[32:30] what you got to see is
[32:32] is that man
[32:33] or satan through man
[32:35] in all these apocalyptic things that we
[32:38] see on television
[32:39] they're not far off where do you think
[32:40] they get that idea from
[32:43] where do you think they get that idea
[32:46] from the word of god that's already told
[32:48] us
[32:49] satan you know satan is is perverting
[32:51] what god has told us was going to happen
[32:54] so um
[32:57] my point is if they're going to build
[32:59] houses they got to have something here
[33:00] to build them with
[33:02] or
[33:04] either wood or mortar or something i
[33:06] mean they're going to build it
[33:09] the jews are going to build a temple
[33:10] before we even get here we got to cover
[33:12] that so we ought to cover that time
[33:13] period in here that's what i mean let's
[33:15] don't get so hung up on that that's too
[33:16] much detail that
[33:18] that doesn't matter to me it's just what
[33:20] i'm saying is let's just remember the
[33:22] battle of armageddon kills people it
[33:24] does not destroy so much buildings
[33:27] you know they got an atomic bomb now
[33:28] that'll blow ever that'll kill everybody
[33:30] but leave the building standing why do
[33:32] you think they're doing that they're
[33:33] planning ahead don't you think our
[33:34] government all these other governments
[33:36] they're planning ahead they're trying to
[33:38] survive
[33:39] this apocalypse that everybody knows is
[33:41] coming
[33:42] everybody knows it's coming every nation
[33:44] knows this coming why do you think they
[33:45] have a little secret thing
[33:47] why do you think they're putting up this
[33:48] and putting up that and
[33:50] building stuff under the ground what do
[33:51] you think they're doing now
[33:53] to survive a holocaust or to survive an
[33:56] apocalypse
[33:58] survival man's gonna still try to
[34:00] survive it doesn't matter if he's a
[34:02] natural man he wants to survive
[34:05] that's why we put our hope in jesus do i
[34:07] take those fig leaves on yeah absolutely
[34:10] that's why we got put our hope in jesus
[34:12] and what he's done for us
[34:14] my brother dale can preach and we put
[34:16] our hope in christ that he will be the
[34:18] protector because buddy without him we
[34:20] have zero protection amen
[34:23] zero protection all right
[34:25] now let's go to daniel 12 and let's read
[34:27] this last chapter
[34:29] of the book of daniel before we go
[34:33] [Music]
[34:35] now 11 talks about
[34:38] governments coming in and all this
[34:39] because you
[34:40] you understand one thing for sure when
[34:42] when we go into rapture
[34:44] and all heck breaks loose over here we
[34:46] got earthquakes and california's gone
[34:50] probably a third of our population is
[34:52] going to be dead
[34:54] because it's not only going to kill them
[34:56] people are going to die of starvation
[34:57] they're going to die our malaria and all
[34:59] these other things
[35:00] associated with that earthquake right
[35:03] not just one big
[35:04] everybody did no
[35:07] so people are going to be coming in from
[35:09] all sides helping us
[35:12] to me that's when brother brown probably
[35:14] could see that the russians would come
[35:16] in and
[35:17] and you know well they're godless people
[35:19] they'll be godless people
[35:22] even normal people are godless people
[35:25] sorry
[35:26] but even the good kind people are
[35:28] godless people that's right that's right
[35:31] sorry that's just the way it is if you
[35:33] don't accept him now don't try to accept
[35:35] him then
[35:39] it's a problem i have with that uh
[35:40] somebody we were anybody ever watched
[35:43] that um
[35:44] left behind series
[35:46] with kirk cameron left behind
[35:49] the first one well well see the first
[35:51] one what they do is is they put the
[35:53] antichrist he kind of walks in the u.n
[35:55] and by mind control he takes over
[35:57] everybody
[35:58] i said well
[36:00] and see all the denominational people
[36:01] that love it
[36:03] somebody was saying something to me
[36:04] about it and i said well i saw the
[36:06] antichrist the first time thing came on
[36:08] the first five minutes of the
[36:10] movie because what their pretense was is
[36:13] that planes were falling out of the sky
[36:15] buses were wrecking and there was a
[36:17] rapture
[36:19] had taken place already
[36:21] and these were left behind
[36:24] then they get saved after they're left
[36:26] behind that's right
[36:28] so that's the anti to me the antichrist
[36:30] was the first five minutes of the movie
[36:32] that's right
[36:34] he was just showing himself at the end
[36:37] but the first five minutes of the movie
[36:39] when i started watching i said but see
[36:41] most denominational people believe that
[36:43] that's right that you're going to have a
[36:45] rapture and then after the rapture
[36:48] you're going to be able to get saved
[36:49] that is not there's no bible for that
[36:50] there's no truth for that that is an old
[36:52] wives tale that's right and really it is
[36:54] it's allowed the devil for what it is
[36:57] just like follow us on holy ghost
[36:59] baptism and all that you know it's a lot
[37:00] of the devil
[37:01] and people eat it up because everybody
[37:03] loved that left behind they had one and
[37:05] two you know they kept making them but
[37:07] the rapture is a secret
[37:09] and if a plane falls down in front of
[37:11] your automobile yeah that's no secret oh
[37:13] i know we'll see it was all over in the
[37:15] paper oh td jakes was on television you
[37:17] know and he was telling them that the
[37:19] raptor took place and i would that i
[37:21] thought
[37:24] what are you still doing here
[37:29] you know who did you know who t.d.j said
[37:32] black preacher and i mean he's really
[37:33] he's got some good ideas but he's
[37:36] denominational but i thought what are
[37:38] you doing on television in the directors
[37:41] what are you doing still here because he
[37:42] was telling them on the new on the on
[37:44] the news you know what it happened
[37:47] i thought either this is a recording or
[37:49] you're still here
[37:53] but it's not funny i mean it really is
[37:54] not because it's a deception that people
[37:57] are in and i thank god for the truth
[38:00] every day but you think when that
[38:02] california goes up
[38:04] that is gonna pipeline its electrical
[38:07] lines so i said more people will
[38:09] probably die afterwards than before of
[38:11] of uh
[38:13] disease infection you can't get to
[38:15] everybody
[38:17] broke bone you know internal injuries
[38:19] it's just gonna be horrible
[38:21] but now watch now watch here we go
[38:23] through 1260 days
[38:27] verse 12.
[38:28] and at that time shall michael stand up
[38:30] the great prince which standeth for the
[38:32] children of thy people and who's thy
[38:34] people
[38:35] the jews
[38:37] right
[38:38] and there shall be a time of trouble
[38:40] such as never was since there was a
[38:42] nation even to that same time and at
[38:44] that time thy people shall be delivered
[38:47] every one that shall be found written in
[38:48] the book
[38:52] 144
[38:54] that's 144 thousand he's talking about
[38:56] by people he's not talking about us
[38:58] he's so much 144 000.
[39:00] michael comes down and stands and fights
[39:03] for him
[39:04] but he doesn't stay there he takes them
[39:05] in a rapture
[39:07] right there right there she becomes
[39:09] troubleshooting there was a nation at
[39:10] the same time at that time that piece
[39:11] shall be delivered
[39:13] somebody's got to be delivered
[39:14] somebody's got to be redeemed and taken
[39:16] up
[39:17] because i believe when you deliver
[39:19] something that means it's in one
[39:20] situation and you take them out of that
[39:22] situation and you deliver them out of
[39:24] that situation i believe that's what
[39:25] they're saying right
[39:27] everyone that should be found written in
[39:28] the book what the 144 thousand plus the
[39:30] two prophets let's not forget them
[39:33] now but you guys see that this is a
[39:35] twofold
[39:36] and many that sleep in the dusty earth
[39:38] shall awake some after like now what
[39:39] they've done the scripture now is way
[39:41] back over here
[39:43] because there's no resurrection
[39:46] of everybody
[39:48] until the white throne judgment
[39:50] this is where the judgment happened he
[39:51] says some to everlasting life now
[39:55] that's got to be people that were that
[39:57] had died without the holy ghost
[40:00] and then they're given eternal life
[40:04] everybody got that you're a little quiet
[40:06] all right
[40:07] but that's the truth that's it for the
[40:09] white throne that's at the white throne
[40:11] many of them that sleep in the dust of
[40:12] the earth shall awake some to
[40:13] everlasting life and some to shame and
[40:15] everlasting contempt that don't happen
[40:17] right here
[40:18] the judgment's not right here the
[40:20] judgment's over here
[40:22] all right and they that be wise shall
[40:24] silence shine is the brightness
[40:26] of the firmament and they that turn many
[40:28] to righteousness as the stars
[40:30] forever but thou o daniel
[40:33] in other words daniel rest
[40:37] this ain't gonna happen during your time
[40:40] okay this is not gonna happen during
[40:42] your time daniel
[40:44] shut up the words and seal the book
[40:46] even to the time of the end
[40:50] so daniel this is not going to happen
[40:51] until the end time
[40:53] and many shall run to and fro and
[40:54] knowledge should be increased
[40:56] then i daniel looked to behold there
[40:58] stood other two one on this side of the
[41:00] bank and the on the other side of the
[41:01] river
[41:02] and one said to the man clothed in linen
[41:04] which was upon the waters of the river
[41:06] what is waters in the bible
[41:09] people
[41:10] he was standing in the people
[41:13] how long shall it be to the end of these
[41:15] wonders
[41:18] now look
[41:19] he's going to answer this in several
[41:21] parts
[41:24] all right we haven't covered this so we
[41:25] may have to cover it again but we're
[41:26] going to cover it now and i heard the
[41:28] man clogged and now look i'm sorry
[41:30] and one said to the man clothed in linen
[41:32] which was upon the world river how long
[41:34] shall it be to the end of these wonders
[41:36] what wonders
[41:38] from here up
[41:40] from here
[41:41] [Music]
[41:42] who are the two
[41:45] no actually i really don't know okay
[41:47] i really don't know maybe the lord will
[41:49] reveal that to us but one said to the
[41:51] other one how long shall be the end of
[41:52] these wonders all right
[41:55] and i heard the man clothed in linen
[41:56] which was upon the waters of the river
[41:59] when he held up his right hand and his
[42:02] left hand unto heaven and swear by him
[42:04] live forever that it shall be for a time
[42:08] times
[42:10] and a half and a what dividing of time
[42:13] and a half and a half so you got one
[42:16] plus two is three and a half makes three
[42:18] and a half
[42:19] all right so this is going to start this
[42:22] accomplishing what and when he shall
[42:24] have accomplished to scatter the power
[42:26] of the holy people all these things
[42:28] shall be finished all right
[42:30] and i heard but i understood not daniel
[42:32] wasn't getting this but it wasn't for
[42:34] him
[42:37] and i heard but i understood not
[42:40] that i said i then said i oh my lord
[42:43] what shall be the end of these things
[42:46] daniel's asking that question
[42:48] the one on the the one on the
[42:50] the one up here asked the question and
[42:52] daniel wasn't in this i want you to
[42:53] watch
[42:55] one said to the man clothed in linen
[42:58] it's one of the two
[43:00] but then daniel comes down here and says
[43:02] and i heard
[43:05] and i understood not then said i so this
[43:08] is daniel talking to gabriel remember
[43:10] gabriel's one that's telling him this
[43:11] gabriel's one has given him these
[43:12] instructions
[43:14] then said i o my lord what shall be the
[43:16] end of these things daniel wanted to
[43:18] know exactly when that was gonna take
[43:21] place
[43:22] because the three and a half years is
[43:23] going to be for redemption of the holy
[43:25] people for what the the jews
[43:28] okay
[43:29] the 144 000 is going to be taken out all
[43:31] right
[43:33] and he said go that way daniel for the
[43:35] words are closed up and sealed till the
[43:36] time of the end
[43:38] many shall be purified and make white
[43:40] and tried but the wicked shall do
[43:41] wickedly and none of the wicked shall
[43:43] understand but the wise shall understand
[43:46] and from the time that the daily
[43:48] sacrifice shall be taken away
[43:52] it's not going to be taken away here
[43:54] remember we just read in daniel 9 24
[43:55] it's going to be taken away in the midst
[43:57] of the week right
[43:59] from the time that's the day the
[44:00] sacrifice shall be taken away and the
[44:02] abomination to make its desolate set up
[44:06] there shall be one thousand two hundred
[44:08] and ninety days
[44:11] you say that's more than twelve hundred
[44:12] sixty i'll show you in a couple weeks
[44:15] while that has to be that way
[44:17] blessed is either weight isn't coming to
[44:18] the one thousand
[44:20] three hundred thirty five you got 1335
[44:22] days now to deal with
[44:25] but remember it's not an addition
