TRANSCRIPT
========================================
someday as he says also in another place thou art a priest forever after the order of Melchizedek what was Melchizedek Melchizedek was a priest but Melchizedek the order of Melchizedek remember a lot of people think it was a priestly order which went down through the generations but it's not easy without father mother brother Graham said now wait a man without father mother how could this be a perpetual you know human guy how can this be a human man right now if he had on human closed and a head on a human flesh puppy on a flesh bag you just hit the bag up and step it out step 10 addicted back up alright cuz look who in the days of his flesh we had offered up prayers and supplications with strong crying and tears under him that was able to save him from death and was hurt this time I Christ now now remember Melchizedek in the human flesh form was not Jesus Christ hear what I said in the human flesh form he was not Jesus Christ man but he became Jesus Christ when he became a baby and was born like me in you because milk acid it wasn't born in you okay that was just a body step he just created a body stepped into it that theophany of God stepped into that body talked to Abraham and then what happened is if you were able to see it then you see a man walking away from Abraham and he just he does take the ground he goes over into another dimension so that was not Jesus Christ the person this is the same because male calves are they didn't down for our sin Jesus Christ died for our sins now brother Brown said no because it didn't became Jesus Christ so you gotta be careful with that Mel Cassidy became Jesus Christ because the theophany that was in bill Cassidy that was talking to Abraham is the same theophany that was in that man called Jesus Christ not too different the Alpha needs not to differ God's right but the order of melchizedek being a priesthood it's not true today it's not a apostolic succession explained to you many times before even though being the assistant pastor this church if God forbid something wants to happen to that I don't immediately take over no way that's apostolic succession that's that's the old order back in the Old Testament where Aaron and his sons and his son son son son that ain't true in the New Testament what would happen is you would give me a list of preachers you wanted to hear we'd bring them in for two or three months and we'd see what you think about them then you could vote okay so it's not just um and thank god that's not that way yeah you don't want to be we've seen it preachers place they're signed in this position and it just it don't work haven't we seen them who in the days of his flesh wind offer a prayer and supplication with strong cries and tears when him was able to save him from death and was hurting that he feared though he were a son yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered and being made perfect you said Jesus Christ mm-hmm I'm jumps reading what the Bible says not or complete he was perfect in himself he's got almighty but he never lived in a human body before like that which came from a baby all the way up so he could be our brother because remember he's our brother he felt everything we felt and being made perfect or complete he became the doctor of eternal salvation unto all them that obey he went to Calvary died that same person came back on the day of Pentecost in the Holy Ghost and come inside the believer to make you and us you and him eternal same people same person remember that's our problem we think there's like two three different eternal life that's going to one that's God so if you have eternal life you have God Amen that's right my question is going to be later on this brother Brown preach Christ is the mystery of God revealed right words cross today a second person oh we're little Christ steps no it's not when you say these that Messiah that's a big difference we do know if crisis didn't use a hope of glory and you got to have the mind of Christ in your crush will even sell this you better believe it or you're a second person that's the whole thing is we we say oh that's great what God did no I you need to put yourself except for the virgin birth you need to insert your life right into Jesus Christ life because we get exactly what he gets in man Romans 8 he said for Ayers and Dohrn heirs now with the Bible lied if we don't get everything Jesus done it okay let's go one step further he never created anything while he was here what you a napkin squirrel we've seen things come you think things go hmm even creators that's why I say it hates us so much remember brother Brown said God I'm that Satan and God are equal except for one thing Satan cannot create Satan has no seed to multiply sell because you can't create anything that's why he hates us because here he sees the little prophet walk here one day and say let there be a squirrel there one there one there one there that all this happened all these things come from nothing into something oil in a car brother Harris had gas come into his vehicle that was bringing something from nothing that's the creation you know what God loved me so much you just change there while he's in there just keeps it going sometimes I wish that happen but on before my daughter's need to have all changes like 40 bucks a base but he don't have money to do it so that's why God give him that excess but we have access to be able to go change our own a man gotta give you your needs not you won't we always would want that to happen but our needs are we can go having done that he sure could and thank God for that so that old truck probably used oil well it had to to be empty the mechanic told them they said if there was no the oil light came on that means the oil was dripped right it went out somewhere he went out somewhere right but the mechanic said there's no there's no leak anyway so anyway yeah now it's full you got four minutes okay short version we were Church Mandy my niece Maggie was there was her baby William he was like a toddler and he the dad jumped up and ran outside us into the vestibule and he I was in the back I jumped up and ran out there and that baby was dead somebody Casca pee and turn purple and they they call I don't want but he was getting cool and he was just stiff right and we'd be in to pray and he I believe that yes and out before killed a dead man in my arms before felt life come back in episode we are living way below our privilege there I think somebody said though in a message 50 something years ago that we're living privileges all right so here we go called on hot bricks after the order of melchizedek let's get down to verse 14 in one quick call of God in high priest after the order of melchizedek of whom we have many things to say and hard to be uttered seeing your dough of hearing now we're not done here we're good for a win for the time ye ought to be teachers you have neat one teach you again which be the first principles of the Oracles we've done and our become such as have need of milk and not of strong meat in other words you see that and I'm sorry you see that in the message everybody's wanting to go back and drink milk you know why cuz it's easy it's easy to pour some milk that's telling them the other day we round with that last two weeks but you know you pour milk in a glass it's really easy you can go getting a refrigerator pour the milk glass and drinking but to eat meat unless you go to Walmart and get it instant they had to kill the cow clean the cow clean the chicken prepare it kinda put it in the oven see what I mean it takes a little more effort be meat than it does just to drink milk alright so we need to put forth a little more effort and not love he said that we teach you again and I know we need my brother nails going back to salvation but it's to bring is to pick everybody up and bring everybody forward it's not for everybody we rejoice in that but we need to see the higher form of justification if we've already been justified we don't need to go back to do it again in baby form we need to see the next step of justice we've been teaching in the seal that's it and then now when we got into the highest form of justification which is the fifth seal the real you didn't do it so we got to come to that realization for every one that you just milk is unskillful in the word of righteousness that's why you see people babbling around in the message don't have a clue what's going on right they'll have included by any kind of revelation all they know brother ground with the Prophet and then will believe that what do you say what he said is what we got to get it and not verbatim quotes will kill you there's gonna be quotes and people to help but a living quote will never send anybody no never go to hell if you're living whatever those quotes are I'm talking like my will and for if you're living in a you can't go to hell we come back this message this message and the prophets message came from Almighty God it came from eternity from Indonesia that's what we'll talk about with the Seventh Seal because that's what happened eternity actually come right here that's right and told us the love letter but strong meat belongs to them that are a full age even those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil that's the statue of a perfect man right thing to exercise means to open your Bible yes you had it boy I mean your babe but strong meat belongeth to them that are of full age in other words you have grown up the statue of a perfect man or that word is mature and that's exactly what it is listen Latour baby Christians are not going in a rapture right I'm sorry nobody change they don't have to pass away mature Christians are the only people it's going to stand one day and say death where you staying grave where's your big dream that's gonna come up the arm goes out to you supposed to wipe it off that's not a fairy tale that's part of the Act hey lis transcript let's get out of here [Music] didn't have everyone here today really good now everyone here today oh thank you ma'am sorry I thought you were just talking to somebody wait I apologize good to be here today ain't good to be back to be back come on they've only folks getting a living right this fellowship that's right all right so let's go we're gonna back up a little bit Hebrews four we were in Hebrews five but we're going to go back to Hebrews fo forward just for a moment thank you brother police and Ryan for yet taking over while we don't believe that job riding down the appreciate dr. mouth bridge the doctor that's Ryan Dunn it's a nice good class I told him I said what you've owned you only do reputation like me or what I did that would rather come up with me this week and say you and away and you don't even buy from Newfoundland I said no he said well out from Newfoundland and his brother Newfoundland called me and told me to watch one of your video that's well I'm sorry about that he said really enjoyed it so man you never know who's you never know who's watching in so chapter four papers he was just talking about the minister I'm bad my ear except they don't know he didn't mean somebody I knew that this brother ate a piece from beautiful and he has there's another brother then some massive Church over there in this one that everyone must watch us I don't know so anyway let us therefore fear lest a promise being left us of inter endurance rest any of you should seem to come short of them now remember the promise was not of that day but when we're born again we enter into the rest of God all right and we rest we should be still rest in your soul as resting the parent is just a rest of the rest of you that's got fight crying to us was the gospel preached as well as unto them but the word preached did not profit them what's he talking about he's talking about going back to Israel and Israel says Sabbath day seventh day that's the day we're gonna rest and that's gonna be it the seventh day tell me something yes when you see a little red dot kill the red dot it's on okay okay let's try again okay all right take the bus and the driving us we're on to us the gospel preachers well until then maybe somebody's talking about Israel that takes a day it'll take some day and says like our seventh-day Adventists I mean you talked to several day Adventists if you go to church on Sunday that's the anti-crime right I mean Alan you'll see it on the billboard do you want to learn about the Antichrist come and kind of look talk to us then with day Adventist because if you celebrate of course we don't celebrate of Sabbath this is not a Sabbath this is Sunday this is the day the resurrection happen the first day of the week so we really don't celebrate as there was not a Sabbath except for them which Sabbath means survival you take a sabbatical you take a one-day sabbatical that you let everything rafting you I mean you let your six days a restaurant seven just like Christ did I mean when you said that I had this guy come through my air conditioning in well then he started talking about the changes and all that and the state blossom you are interested when we're not you know that kind of thing I'm telling you they're hard light on that that's their that's their doctrine is that everyone else it's Antichrist if you celebrate your Sabbath but I told my said it's not Sonny's not Sabbath to me there's not a day of rest sure yeah one day ain't no more now you used to be right I can remember not almost you can too but there was nothing open on Sunday nothing except maybe a few restaurants and maybe some even grocery stores all right but but other than that you got your you filled your vehicle up on Saturday night this mate and you got your sandwiches and you bought your stuff and y'all did the cooking and we didn't go out me and we went home because there wasn't none over right they call it the blue law that's correct right so all right so here we here we are now that God rested the seventh day and now remember you got to be real about this god never rested he wasn't tired he was just taking a interval of time to lay everything develop so he already knew what was going on in his mind he just need to let it develop here he needed to let this to develop and that's what's doing now we're developing into a vision we're gonna get in that with a Seventh Seal maybe in a few more leads about being in division because remember this is all not so we were talking last night about the dimensions and it's just why I feel that Adam and Eve were in a complete rest in the garden before the fall they were they were both eternal and souls they think just one about their day no pain no sorrow no heartache they they would if they wanted to tell my soul they could if they didn't they didn't have to they they just did things cuz they were happy and because they wanted to but wants to Paul happen what happened in that is there was no dimension I don't believe it was any dimension not even talked about last night about angels I believe Adam could see all the angles Adam was not limited I was a son of God he wanted to control this whole earth now this whole earth is pretty big if one man standing hearing what's going on under the bottom of the earth so I believe he just moved away anyway with not just what I believe about that you said while he was in a flesh body so it's to you and he walked through walls and everything else oh no the glorified but you understand what I'm saying before the fall there was no there was no dimensional limitation but as they were going out of that Garden of Eden remember brother I said they got out and they couldn't get back in listen the Garden of Eden is not in this dimension that's right this is Satan Z this is why it's like matter is what we're stuck in because that's matter and our life stays in this dimension until we pass this thing passes the way of they goes over into another dimension that's the oldest in this dimension so I just believe that's when God set the dimensions or separated he said I'll put enmity in which he means division so he putting the enmity between God and man so God can't talk to man like he did with Adam but now he's going to he's going to talk face-to-face back just like he did me or do but there's dimensional changes come leaving brother branham in linen in the sixth dimension and said I wanted to see Jesus and the angel said he's a little higher what he's in the seventh dimension he's already got a glorified body he's standing in a place that no one's ever stood before no one's ever had any mortality but one man he said what about inna I'm not just going to tell you what the Bible said the Bible says no one had reached him calavius F Jesus Christ all right which means he was mortal now he is immortal whatever happened to all them other people that disappeared Elijah who died just say he not them then you know whatever happened to them that has no it has a type to me but it has I'm not gonna delve in and try to figure out what happened I'm just gonna tell you what the Bible said Bible says only one man has reached immortality there's only one empty tomb which means someone died come back to life and has not went back into Tim again because many people been resurrected and they're back in the tomb Lazarus isn't maybe the baby language didn't go back in the same tomb that he got resurrected out of it but he went back into a tomb one day because he got a hold knife right all right now Jesus Christ didn't he didn't get old and died he died for us and it came back horrified that Bobby had stepped over into another dimension that's why he can't come back into this dimension but he send the whole sent the Holy Ghost into this dimension to work through you and I that's what we were talking about last night with with angels there are angels ministering spirits that help us did help us do things and you know keeps us safe yes Saint would look kill all in one stack if he'd love to destroy the whole Briarcliff you know that's the last thing he's got to get right so then we now have the angels of God around us if we could see them under an open eyes they'd be like a haze and Elijah pirogues I didn't see the two people standing there him and Elijah and this whole Syrian army and Elijah hood like there's more four of us they are Liam and he said one to ten thousand one but when he opened his eyes they what the angels had to come they were already there the angels were already there so the Angels now are in camp come out of the angels and camped about us that love the Lord cuz watch a friend to us was the gospel preached as low as to them so to Israel the gospel was preached but the word preached did not profit them not being mixed with faith in them the hurting so what it was the people heard and said Oh bless you did think but I'm going by to my Sabbath day the Torah the besides not come yet that's what Paul had to deal with point a deal with a group of people that thought the Messiah was coming and Paul's trying to tell them he's already come he died rose again ascended now he's come back inside of us but we mix it with faith and believe that that's what happened they didn't mix it with faith they be in the old Orthodox Jew but you know what they're going to get faith through two prophets and they're going to get the 144,000 call them out and give them to their rest all right for we which have believed do enter into rest once you believe once you're born again you enter into a rest your soul is done it's finished it's not it's not one of them in mouth things you're as we were talking about last night if you have a definite experience you only if you don't then you didn't that's just the way that when we teach here as much of justification st. you catch the baptism Holy Ghost if you don't know what three then three steps are you've been asleep for about 25 or 30 years a man man we know in this church that we believe in three definite acts of grace and I can take you to all three of mine just and pity right in the Bible you should be able to do the same thing naturally mm-hmm if you had this star at their starting point you know you know like the guy laid me down to sleep you know regular my soul to keep me because soldiers dying priesthood where'd you lose him at where do you love where you lost him free me to find him and he said well now I lay me down to sleep in other words he left him in the cradle Reed's mama saying now I lay me down to sleep so and you know what he went back to that place that's not hard it's not bad being ignorant because ignorant goes into stupid when you when you continue on in that ignorant continuous it's not bad but you stay in ignorance and that's what the it'll did they shut their mind off and stayed in ignorance that the Messiah had come because man they was that was Peter not look think about all the people that were preaching in Jerusalem and preaching him preaching that the Messiah had come and now he's back into them by the new birth and then won't strong snoozer like he didn't come to other well they were telling the truth he didn't come to them first now he didn't come to his own but his own received him not so he goes context of Gentile bride but he's going to go back to them according to the sixth seal because I'm going to feel like pull out 144,000 for we which have believed do enter into rest as he said as I have sworn in my wrath if they shall enter into my rest although the works were finished from the foundation of the world if I got that because what happened is we were talking about this last night when you see brother Brown make statements when you see God in the Bible make statements you got to remember one thing in the mind of God everybody that born-again now he already knew that right but we did we did so if we ever was this seed from the beginning is that Steve that came to you the new birth that birthed you into the back to where you realize that you were in the mind of God and it comes to you have to be careful because it's a fine line to left all right but the fine line is go back to justification saying why do you need them three works of grace if you always love you terminal why do you need to education why brother ground preach justification ain't catching bouncing ho goes all the way up to the future home he creeps them that that's three definite works of grace but most people unless you just say well I was born with this seed in me and I believe the message and decided well that might get you good for this burger but not mr. ching-kuo like that is that not Nestor geelong you can't hide behind that so they're really the works were finished before the foundation well your name was written in the book for the foundation where we were talking about Jesus's name being put into London weren't they about uses name put in taking out and all that but listen that's just that's an allegory there's not an angel sitting up there that's right and Jesus's name in the book and then another angel go that says hi he's not wearing helmet or it's just an allegory to tell you that you can come to a certain place Judas came to a place of sanctification and his name in the book of life in the book of life but not though not the section of the eternal devel K because you can do that because brother Brown says you come to sanctification your name goes on the book as a believable mountain but then you get sanctified there's not somebody up there to write your name remember this like we were coming that was stages in a play like we were talking about the interval you know there's an interval between each play that between each set there's different sets and then you have to take that set off and put a new one on then the actors could portray well that's the same we've been happened there's seven acts of a play first act of the play was called when Iranians from Martin Luther Coleman then now we've got this this ending of the play everything ending up in this church a although the works were finished from the foundation of the world remember somebody asked brother round one times by the remnant if God knows all this and everything's already done in co2 why are you preaching remember remember he said he said hey I gotta throw the net he said I don't know who saved us who's not God does but I gotta throw the net I've got to do the work so sorry but listen if if Jesus were slain before the foundation of the world in the mind of God why'd he have to come down here he had come down here to portray our act brother Graham said the part of that because remember he didn't die Christians don't die God didn't die the dying them can't die Jesus didn't die his body died because his soul went out somewhere and come back alright so he acted the part of death that's the same way with a Christian they're just acting toward death that's why Jesus always said they're sleeping the sleep in earth they just couldn't understand anything he was telling them they were just the body's asleep and then they're over in another dimension like we're gonna talk about maybe a little bit this afternoon where Jesus said it is finished on the cross well now it was finished in this dimension it went finished in another dimension cuz he didn't just stay there the whole town no he went straight to hell free he was preaching the whole time he had a job to do he was still doing a job while even though he said it's finished cuz remember the seven seals silence nothing going on brother I'm saying but now that doesn't mean nothing's going on Jesus looked pretty dead like nothing going on if you were able to look in the tomb but that wasn't there was a lot going on while he was in his silent time [Music] maybe we're going to review the sales and then with a little bit we'll talk about it before he spoke at a certain place of the seventh day on this life and God did rest the seventh day from all his work now remember truth like I said before that's an allegory that's that showing that God what he was finished doing he's creating at that time and he was resting he had stopped collect things developed all right same thing with the six six seals finishes Redemption that's one there's an interval because they stopped and let everybody come in it elects everybody come in so that revelation is five God can take the earth the lamb can take the book there's an interval in there that brother Brown said God was behind the throne or in the church age is doing his immediate or work or his work of redemption and he's still doing it because there's people we love that are not warning in so listen the she seeks still there that's right but now the mercy seat for you Dover if you're mourning it you have no mercy you are the mercy seat when you get morning you know you know I'll go to the mercy say you are the mercy no oh no no doubt yes but that was our sacrifice remember when I was at 53 it says he gave his soul the ransom the soul is what saved you not his body but his body was hanging on the cross for your stripes and my stripes and for your healing in my healing Jesus didn't need a healing in his soul he was the healing so but but you need healing in your body so and when we see that Christ died on the cross and took hold of what he took man nobody could go through that's why he was in complete control even the darkest hour every was that we think about Jesus cross was in control because when he said it's finished he's the one that said it's finished then Roman people didn't say he was finished nobody on earth said it's finished Jesus said it is finished into my hands I commend my spirit even in total control the whole time yeah look like he was in total chaos but he was in complete control alright for a spanking in certain places the sympathy on this was and God did raise the seventh day from all his work and in this place again if they shall enter into my rest in other words another rest coming but the rest is coming on the Sabbath day it's the rest that you and I come to in our soul like I'm staying last night we got a steam down as far up the road as we are we've got to realize that you're born again or not boring in one of the time you've got a real light you got enough it's not got a beam I hope I hope I got the church today well that hope is done I'm here so you got to realize you're here once you realize you have arrived then there's your rest now the problem we have is the memory reason constant space I'm talking about no rest your memory yes your reasoning concert specs and imagination all that does arrest because that's the human part that God is trying to come from the inside out and Satan's going from the outside trying to get by hand so there's your Bible you can't you can't battle in your soul if you're born again there is no level there is no battle in your soul be born again the black dog white dog that the old Indian said was is when he got born again with the white dog with the black dog was that old nature still whirling around inside in that spirit realm you know going around and around he said which will not fade the most hey cuz until you're born again you're not black dog white dog you're blind up your one dog right but when you get born again that moves that black dog out to the middle realm puts the white dog in the center realm and then it just you know there's whacking on each other all the time and it displace against that you see therefore it remaineth that some must enter therein and they to whom it was first preached entered not in because of unbelief just like what we were talking about they did not believe that Christ had already come they're still looking at a Sabbath day that Christ is gonna cut the Messiah is going to come on a certain time again he limited a certain day Santa David today after so long the time it is said today if you will hear my voice harden not your hearts for if Jesus had given them rest and then twenty not half would have spoken over then in other words Jesus when he came he never said all right now he did honor the Sabbath let me taste that he did honor the Sabbath okay but it wasn't a Sabbath like they were talking about Samuel he was in the temple all the time doing things but remember he never spoke of a certain day he said come to me you let him labor and heavy-laden and I'll give you not a day I'll give you a rest that's what he's saying right here he would have spoke of another day if it would have been another 24-hour day they but didn't there remaineth therefore a rest to the people of God which is us for he that has entered into his rest he also has ceased this from its own words thereby get it because you're not judged by your works if you're mourning in your works is now his work you ceased from his own works but we cease from our own work as did God from his alright because remember in Revelations when you come to the white throne judgment you're judged by your works it will be your news and don't a list you did this you didn't do that you did this you didn't do that now if you're standing in judgment you're not judged you already judged we're dead so now this is the end this is the only judgment we'll go through I'll have to write let us labor therefore to enter into that rest no words you're born again lest any man fall after the same example of unbelief little words those people believe so much and that Sabbath to remember and now even listen even they set that day in the Old Testament and remember the guy went out and picked up sticks he picked up sticks on the Sabbath and they stoned him and killed me because God told him to do it because that was part of what the Old Testament was was days and times and rituals and seasons but when Christ come they don't do that no more that's right that's why Jesus would you know Walter neat corner on the Sabbath or you go do this on the Sabbath he's not calling people we can't talk about labor and physical labor you know lest any man fall after the same example unbelief for the work of God is quick and powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul spirit joint mouth so there's soul dust of area the next round and watch this outside rim that's your joy America's you don't have doing Maryland you saw it this time right European theophany right and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart right that's what God give us if we have the word it divides us under and thank God for a prophet that that just grew a little a little simple example of three little like a bold life sent around sold out around the spirit and next realms see take spills melon here I mean hear me but you know why he did it because of the work because of the word he brought that's what he brought to us now we can look back to that now how many times the people read that my brother Dale from that last night how many how many people outside of the message realm if you were to go over and say hey let me tell you about justification st. kicking back then ago most people in denomination will have no clue what you're growing them this way but yet is something of us that's just is settled in our heart and it's exactly because of the what the word exactly because of the word coming to us cutting away all that junk and showing us faith or doubt memory reason constant affection imagination and seat a smell smell in here that's what we see so we see ourselves there and the worst of discerner folks not one man it's the words the discerner of the thoughts and intents of the hearts right all right neither is there any creature that is not manifest in this sight but all things are naked and open to the eyes of him whom we have to do in other words nothing is hidden from God we know that seeing them that we have a great high priest that is passed into the heavens what he's in another dimension Jesus the Son of God let us hold fast our profession for we have not an High Priest which cannot be touched with the feelings of our infirmities but was in all points tempted like as we are yet without sin why because his memories and conscience patient imagination that's not from a fallen nature even though now you're born again your memories and constant spatial imagination has they fallen nature park to it right it has a human part to it everybody got that right that's actually is your human part your body just holds all this stuff together like I said before you know this just in case is what's inside this just keeps you from falling apart all right so so God don't deal with the flesh he'll tell you many times he said I'm not dealing with a play-doh only at the inside yeah that's why Nicodemus said do I have to go back and get in my mother's womb flat you know Jesus said not only you know you got to be born from above you can't be born from you're not anymore for mom and daddy that was your problem that could be with you or bringing up and your dad all right but he's still working on us because that's what the statute perfect man does it brings the nature of Christ into us and don't have a handle things just like he handled all right cuz he walked through the world a human being that was the whole mystery was is that they didn't realize he was God because he was so human he cried he laughed you had to eat him to the bathroom he did probably have a lot of heartaches that we don't know anything about because of the weight of the world was on him but they were saying all you man make yourself done well that's what he's that's what we're saying in the end time that God has made us into God and then you see all these people ran instead ain't perfect you ain't perfect you God you think you're God no I don't think I'm glad I know I'm God if I got to do birds I'm not saying personal Trinity right let us therefore come boldly into the throne of grace that we may obtain mercy and find grace to help in time of need which is just our normal natural everyday life or you know I got plenty of time it's 4:30 in the morning we got a I'm about I put a human you know putting your battery in there 13 yeah I got it right here got my phone all right for every high priest taken from among men is ordained from men and things pertaining to God now he's talking about us that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sin who can have compassion on the ignorant and on them that are out of the way colonel over dinosaurs are not in the way for that he himself also is compassed with infirmity and by reason thereof he ought as for the people so also for himself to offer for since we talk about priests and no man taketh dishonor into himself but he that is called of God as was there in other words Aaron was the only one to go back into the Holy of Holies they went 15 doing a lot of confusion in other words you don't have four pastors in this church we have one one pastor right same way with Aaron we had 100 okay he was a high priest and he wasn't one who did the business and not somebody else so also Christ glorified not himself to be made in high priest but he that said unto Him thou art my son then I have today I have begotten thee wasto not come at the father which is the same person but it's a manifestation Christ never glorified himself he never said look at me of course he said I am the way the truth and the life all that but he always said the father whatever the father says well there's a lot of things all right but he that sent him there are my son today have I begun
