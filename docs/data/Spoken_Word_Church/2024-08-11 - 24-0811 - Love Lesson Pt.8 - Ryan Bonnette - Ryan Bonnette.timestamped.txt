[2:23] uh so we're going to continue on what uh
[2:26] we've been on with the love lessons
[2:28] series
[2:32] so uh just want to say first of all it's
[2:34] such a privilege as we all realize to be
[2:37] considered uh even the opportunity to be
[2:40] the bride of Christ and something we
[2:42] should not take lightly not take for
[2:44] granted um and uh really get a sense of
[2:47] the gravity of that situation it's the
[2:48] best opportunity I believe that's ever
[2:50] been given to mankind so that's what
[2:53] this lesson is all about um we're going
[2:55] to get
[2:57] into I'll summarize the lesson here in a
[2:59] moment but let's Also let's go to the
[3:01] Lord in prayer for just just for this
[3:03] lesson for a moment Heavenly Father pray
[3:05] just help me Lord in teaching uh this
[3:06] lesson that youve put on my heart and I
[3:07] pray it be a blessing to your people
[3:09] here and give them understanding of it I
[3:11] pray and and just help to move out of
[3:12] the way and let and let uh let this be a
[3:14] blessing help to them and their walk
[3:16] with you in Jesus name
[3:19] amen all right so as the scripture says
[3:22] Revelation 19 his wife hath made herself
[3:25] ready so we know there is something for
[3:27] us to do as the bride of Christ I want
[3:30] to give a little word about her about
[3:31] brother Dell um that I didn't get to
[3:34] share yet as as a kind of a little
[3:36] testimony that um we were going to go
[3:38] see him when we found out he was getting
[3:40] bad originally we had decided not to
[3:42] visit him in ICU we don't usually visit
[3:44] people in ICU for so many reasons we're
[3:46] going to wait for him to come home and
[3:47] make him a banana pudding and go visit
[3:49] him at his house well then that evening
[3:51] that we we found out he was so bad that
[3:53] we were going to go the next day when I
[3:56] get up you know to get ready for work I
[3:57] sleep in the afternoon got up about 5
[4:00] that evening and I was going to check
[4:01] what's at one last time make sure it's
[4:03] clear to go and turned out he went to
[4:05] his reward brother waited posted there
[4:07] and I said Lord you knew that was going
[4:08] to happen and so we didn't get to see
[4:10] him that last time but then that next
[4:12] morning at the chicken farm I always try
[4:14] to look for opportunities to take a
[4:15] picture of the sunrises I see see him
[4:17] every morning I went to the back side of
[4:19] the farm and saw this beautiful sunrise
[4:21] and I thought my my dad's favorite
[4:23] scripture weeping may endure for a night
[4:26] but joy comes in the morning Psalm 30
[4:28] and I was thinking Brother D that
[4:29] Sunrise you know he'll he'll be back all
[4:32] those who have gone by the way he
[4:33] they'll be back but it's a reminder
[4:35] every morning of the resurrection of
[4:36] Christ and it's just one of the most
[4:38] beautiful sunrises it was just such a
[4:39] consolation to
[4:41] me um and I want to talk a little bit
[4:43] about his life too this is not
[4:44] necessarily part of the lesson but it
[4:46] it'll tie in pretty nice that think uh
[4:50] Proverbs 13 a good man leaveth an
[4:52] inheritance to his children's
[4:54] children so all all four of my
[4:56] grandparents that passed away a couple
[4:59] of them I got to speak at their funeral
[5:00] just to give a little a few words and I
[5:03] always used this scripture because all
[5:05] of them in one way or another left an
[5:07] inheritance not a penny of money it was
[5:09] an inheritance of a life lived a legacy
[5:13] that they showed me my way to Christ um
[5:17] and both my grandfathers were pastors uh
[5:20] my dad's parents were missionaries in uh
[5:22] East Pakistan my dad sort of grew up
[5:24] there um for a short time in his
[5:26] Elementary years you know and they left
[5:29] such a legacy for me in that way teach
[5:31] me to read the Bible and pray and go to
[5:32] church and um so brother Dale did that
[5:36] he left us an example of a life lived
[5:39] but then all these sermons that we now
[5:41] have of his that are our brothers have
[5:43] so graciously put on the internet even
[5:45] Consolidated them into series that you
[5:47] got the seal Series in ' 82 and the
[5:49] matching pieces in '93 and and gab and I
[5:52] are working we've been working for
[5:53] several years Rel listening to the seals
[5:55] he preached in ' 82 and ' 83 and also
[5:58] starting on the adoption Series where
[5:59] we're going back listening to that and
[6:01] we can just glean over these things
[6:02] these that's an inheritance um and and a
[6:06] legacy that he left to us but that life
[6:09] lived when he was s up here as a
[6:12] revelated person and not bragging but he
[6:16] would tell us these little drop these
[6:18] little hints six books a day two tapes
[6:21] you know he was accused of being a
[6:23] two-year Theologian cuz he studied so
[6:24] much so if I would look at him and I'd
[6:26] say well how didd he get where he's at I
[6:28] want to be where he's at on that
[6:29] revelation ladder and I take that
[6:31] Revelation recipe six books a day two
[6:33] tapes it doesn't have to be exactly that
[6:35] formula you know just meditating on the
[6:37] word of God like he did constantly
[6:39] listening every day and he would say to
[6:43] like his peers you know some people had
[6:44] equal opportunity to come to that level
[6:46] of revelation that came in the message
[6:48] alongside him and years later he sort of
[6:50] left them and they're still preaching
[6:52] God's in a prophet and he's over here
[6:54] preaching the seals and Daniel 7 weeks
[6:56] and he said what have you been doing
[6:57] reading gre's Almanac you know he always
[6:59] made that G's Almanac now it's Facebook
[7:01] or whatever you let get in your way
[7:03] between you and the Lord so don't forget
[7:06] tithe your time just a good rule of
[7:08] thumb at least 2 and a half hours a day
[7:10] and I know that seems like a lot of time
[7:12] but if you space it out 10 minutes of
[7:13] Prayer in the morning 10 minute listen
[7:15] to sermon on the way to work meditate on
[7:17] the word of God if you can while you're
[7:18] at work if your job allows that have
[7:20] your devotional in the evening with your
[7:22] family and by the end of the day you've
[7:24] probably spent 2 and 1/2 hours just a
[7:26] little here and a little there that does
[7:28] tie in with my lesson perfectly cuz my
[7:31] lesson is Daily Bread so love lesson
[7:35] part 8 Our Daily Bread all I'm talking
[7:37] about if you lose me in all these
[7:39] examples this has been my whole life
[7:41] story seeky first the kingdom of God
[7:42] since I was 12 if you lose me in all
[7:45] these need to- GRE examples then I want
[7:47] to summarize it right at the beginning
[7:49] all I'm saying is it seems like a
[7:51] daunting task because the amount of word
[7:54] that's being revealed in our day and you
[7:56] think of all these the Bible is a thick
[7:58] book and all these sermon books that we
[8:00] have available in the seals book and
[8:01] Daniel 7 weeks Church AE book all these
[8:03] thick books and if you're not an Avid
[8:05] Reader which I'm not um then it might
[8:07] seem intimidating but if you just take
[8:10] it a day at a time you're not looking to
[8:12] read the entire Bible in one day just
[8:13] read your daily bread just a little bit
[8:16] here and a little bit there and you've
[8:18] got 365 days a year and that adds up it
[8:22] really does I've been reading my Bible
[8:23] every day since I was 15 and I see down
[8:26] to the scope of time now I see so many
[8:28] things that has blessed me with through
[8:30] that um and brought me here to the
[8:34] message so many other things Gabby and I
[8:38] are an anomaly we shouldn't even be here
[8:40] I mean some of you were raised in the
[8:41] message but we shouldn't be here she was
[8:43] an orphan girl tossed about from Pillar
[8:45] To Post never really had a solid family
[8:48] much less a church family and she prayed
[8:50] all that time God give me a family and
[8:51] he brought her to a message family that
[8:54] wanted to adopt a boy and at this picnic
[8:57] they were meeting these potential kids
[8:58] they could adopt and they took a picture
[9:00] of this boy and they went home and they
[9:02] got the picture developed and it was not
[9:03] the boy it was Gabby and her sister and
[9:06] they said and they were not even in the
[9:08] frame and they said well maybe the Lord
[9:10] wants us to adopt those girls so they
[9:12] did and here sits Gabby today as a
[9:15] testament to
[9:17] that that's predestination everybody
[9:20] said you came a little old seed I didn't
[9:21] have a little old seed in me I had a
[9:23] little old seed of the serpent you know
[9:24] but what I did have is a desire for more
[9:27] of God and God put the word my path
[9:29] that's
[9:30] predestination the word comes
[9:32] predestinated interally from God and it
[9:34] will find its place but he does it
[9:36] through people and through books and
[9:38] through interactions in your life and
[9:41] and churches and pastors and the fold
[9:44] Ministry that he puts in your path
[9:46] knowing what you'll do with it that's
[9:47] predestination am we shouldn't be here I
[9:51] would be in the Baptist Church still um
[9:54] uh Sister Amy y'all some of yall know my
[9:56] testimony that Amy and I Amy Stewart
[9:58] then Silas she and I were both in high
[10:01] school together marching band we dated
[10:03] for a while but one day sister uh sister
[10:06] gwy gave me a church book and said God
[10:07] sent a prophet and I said oh okay and to
[10:11] the seventh Church age I said oh what's
[10:13] the church age I'd already read the
[10:15] Bible by then cover to cover little
[10:16] baptist boy I'd already read it but I
[10:18] didn't read that I didn't understand
[10:20] that so anyway so that's predestination
[10:24] God putting somebody in your path
[10:28] amen so do something for your goals uh
[10:31] brother John durett talks about setting
[10:33] goals and I'm saying that's sort of same
[10:35] thing in this lesson form good habits
[10:38] set goals and then do something toward
[10:40] that goal every day and in this case I'm
[10:42] talking about the mysteries of God and
[10:43] the revelation of the word make that
[10:44] your goal that I want to be part of the
[10:46] Bride I want to understand d 7 weeks I
[10:48] want to understand the seals what are
[10:50] you doing toward that goal read the seal
[10:52] book if it's just a page a day just read
[10:54] it
[10:56] right so it works a lot toward other
[10:58] things in your life too um y'all
[11:01] probably won't be able to see that but
[11:02] I'll read it to you this is out of that
[11:03] Love Dare book that Gabby and I have
[11:04] been reading um love works in all areas
[11:09] the words of the Lord are pure words
[11:10] like silver refined and Earth and
[11:12] furnace purified seven times H sounds
[11:15] like seven Church ages Psalm 12 if being
[11:19] a regular Bible reader is new for you
[11:22] you'll be surprised how quickly you'll
[11:24] begin thinking differently and more
[11:26] eternally as you begin digesting it
[11:29] truth day by day if you are serious
[11:31] about establishing strategies for life
[11:33] based on God's way of doing things he'll
[11:35] guide you to make the connections
[11:37] between what you're reading and how it
[11:38] applies it's an enlightening Journey for
[11:41] uh with fresh discoveries to be made all
[11:42] the time God has a plan for the way you
[11:45] handle your money he has a plan for the
[11:47] way you raise your children he knows how
[11:48] you should treat your body and how you
[11:50] should spend your time he has a plan for
[11:53] the way you handle conflict and a plan
[11:54] for marital success most any issue that
[11:58] you will encounter in life can be taken
[12:00] to the counsil of scripture and
[12:01] illuminated by his perfect wisdom after
[12:04] all God designed life itself that's
[12:06] right isn't it just like your maker to
[12:07] know exactly what you need amen Matthew
[12:11] 6:33 seek ye first the kingdom of God
[12:12] you know that scripture um other things
[12:16] in your life as you seek God every day
[12:18] and reading his word other things in
[12:19] life kind of start to fall into place
[12:22] and with your money and your marriage
[12:23] and raising children so as I was saying
[12:27] earlier it's a daunting task I'm going
[12:30] to use that word a lot so daunting means
[12:32] tending to overwhelm or intimidate a
[12:36] daunting Tas to think of all these
[12:38] sermon books and even the Bible itself
[12:40] such a thick
[12:43] book
[12:44] so one of the key points I'm probably
[12:47] going to stress in this lesson is that
[12:50] you don't have to make yourself
[12:51] understand it you do your part and God
[12:53] will do his part on so many things that
[12:56] you that seem Out Of Reach and seem like
[12:58] you can't attain to just do your daily
[13:00] bread amen he'll do his part he'll put
[13:03] somebody in the pull pit I read the
[13:04] Bible don't know how many times and
[13:06] didn't understand most of it but he'd
[13:08] always be faithful to put someone in the
[13:09] pull pit to not only answer my questions
[13:13] but would make it relevant to what I
[13:15] just read that morning how many times
[13:18] have you seen the sermon of the preacher
[13:20] line up with your daily reading or your
[13:21] devotional with your
[13:23] family so possessed in the gate of the
[13:25] enemy uh after trial brother Banner says
[13:27] when the love of God comes comes into
[13:29] the heart and you fall in love with God
[13:32] he reveals himself the Bible meaning the
[13:34] interpretation of the Bible is God
[13:36] himself interpreting his promises for
[13:38] the Bible is written between the
[13:40] lines brother Wade often refers to how
[13:42] do you eat an elephant it's a good analy
[13:45] I don't think anyone here has ever eaten
[13:47] an elephant besides me brother Louis
[13:48] he's the only one I can think of that
[13:49] might try that so if you was to eat an
[13:53] elephant how would you do it there's
[13:55] only one way to eat an elephant right
[13:57] one body at a time that's right
[14:00] Dave Ramsey in his program talks about
[14:01] baby steps you don't try to pay off your
[14:04] whole entire debt when you start that
[14:05] program all at once you just take baby
[14:07] steps pay off the little one first and
[14:10] then the next biggest one and the next
[14:11] one and so on baby
[14:14] steps the invisible Union of the bride
[14:16] of Christ skip on down to the Highlight
[14:19] the word became blood the word bled for
[14:21] you and you are washed in the bleeding
[14:22] word the word bleeding the life of God
[14:24] and the word and the Word was bled for
[14:26] you that you might be washed from the
[14:28] filth of the prostitutes and be cleans
[14:30] and cleaned and Sanctified by the
[14:32] washing of Water by the word and make
[14:34] sure your mind and heart State on God
[14:35] and on his word
[14:37] am
[14:41] so continue on down also again down to
[14:45] the yellow and you are wearing the
[14:48] wedding band of predestinated unmar
[14:50] Grace a wedding band of Grace unmar of
[14:52] your own God did it himself he knew you
[14:55] before the foundation of the world so he
[14:57] slipped the wedding band on you there he
[14:59] put your name in the book what a
[15:01] Thanksgiving the benefits of daily Bible
[15:03] reading um see James 1 Let's skip on
[15:07] down verse 7 for let not that man think
[15:09] that he shall receive anything of the
[15:11] Lord the man that's wavereth okay
[15:13] unstable naturally we are very unstable
[15:16] and uh but a double-minded man is
[15:18] unstable in all his
[15:20] ways ask God for wisdom and
[15:23] understanding revelation of the word as
[15:24] you read it he absolutely will help you
[15:27] understand it if you make an effort
[15:28] we're about just your daily bread make
[15:30] an effort no matter how small reading
[15:33] his word will give you stability both
[15:35] spiritually and in your life
[15:37] choices 1 Corinthians 15 therefore my
[15:40] beloved Brethren Be You Stand Fast
[15:42] unmovable always abounding the work of
[15:44] the Lord for as much as you know your
[15:45] labor is not in vain in the Lord the
[15:49] least little thing you do in private in
[15:50] secret in your prayer closet God sees it
[15:53] and he'll reward you abundantly for it
[15:56] your work is never in vain and Lord this
[15:57] includes your efforts of reading the
[15:59] Bible he sees your effort it teaches you
[16:01] to love how to be patient be a good
[16:03] spouse how to be a good parent how to be
[16:05] content even how to receive Divine
[16:07] Healing it's the answer to all
[16:10] things
[16:11] so spoken word is Original Seed this is
[16:15] one of my favorite quotes stay right
[16:17] with that word stay with that Watch What
[16:19] Happens say Lord I believe it it's in
[16:21] the Holy Spirit then watch then if he
[16:23] goes to bearing record then you'll know
[16:25] you got it not by some sensation the
[16:27] devil's do that not by some miracle the
[16:29] Devils do that but by your constant
[16:32] belief in the word of God and the life
[16:34] that you live never deny nothing say
[16:37] Amen to the word you know as you as you
[16:38] see more unfold you say Amen keep
[16:40] walking into it you might not understand
[16:43] it at first that's irrelevant it's just
[16:45] the M the fact that you you walk into it
[16:49] and when I came to the message I didn't
[16:50] see it I didn't understand it at first
[16:52] and it was really uh I I doubted it at
[16:55] first but you know I didn't have any
[16:56] reason to say it's not right so my job
[16:59] is open that church age book s wi gave
[17:02] me and I took it one page a day for a
[17:04] whole year it took me to read that book
[17:05] The First Time comparing it with my
[17:07] Bible and trying to figure out if
[17:08] brother Brandon was trying to pull the
[17:10] wool over my eyes you know misquote a
[17:12] scripture or something it makes the word
[17:15] becoming flesh see flesh and the same
[17:19] water
[17:21] spirit uh from James 4 submit yourself
[17:23] so to God resist the devil and he will
[17:24] flee from you draw n to God He will draw
[17:27] nigh to you cleanse your your hands you
[17:29] Sinners and purify your hearts ye double
[17:31] minded be afflicted and mourn and weep
[17:33] let your uh let your laughter be turned
[17:35] into mourning and your joy into
[17:37] heaviness humble yourselves in the sight
[17:39] of the Lord and He Shall lift you up so
[17:41] let's talk about the ant for a few
[17:43] minutes Proverbs 6 go to the ant thou
[17:46] sluggard consider her ways and be wise
[17:48] which having no guide overseer or ruler
[17:50] provideth her meat in the summer and
[17:52] gathereth her food in the Harvest so if
[17:54] we want to talk about somebody being
[17:56] sort of um un equipped I guess you you
[17:58] might say not able to accomplish a whole
[18:01] lot in comparison to like a human you
[18:03] know ants can't get a whole lot of work
[18:05] done um in comparison to US you know so
[18:08] they're they're a very small creature
[18:10] and but they're such diligent workers
[18:12] they just don't stop they keep going and
[18:15] they don't they don't consider whether
[18:16] something's even possible or not they
[18:18] don't look at the how how big the the
[18:20] chasm maybe is they have to cross or
[18:22] whatever they just keep going this never
[18:24] stop so some facts about ants a lot of
[18:27] different species this is just kind of
[18:29] broad okay um on average an ant can
[18:33] travel about 3,000 mi in its lifetime
[18:36] which is typically 1 to three years
[18:39] that's a lot for an ant you think about
[18:42] a daunting task as an ant to go 3,000
[18:45] miles ants can travel up to four miles
[18:47] in a single day that's pretty
[18:50] intimidating to think of an ant that
[18:52] going going that far in a day moving at
[18:54] a pace of about 3 in per second they're
[18:57] able to travel such distances because
[19:00] they work throughout the day and night
[19:02] including forging for food at night in
[19:04] the spring and summer work your ants can
[19:07] travel up to 100 yards from their nest
[19:09] to find food so consider the ant very
[19:12] diligent
[19:14] worker um so in 2007 which is not the
[19:18] Year this picture was taken it's just a
[19:20] good quick picture I found of our house
[19:22] that was our starter home in 2007 we had
[19:25] a total debt Gabby and I um when we got
[19:27] married we started off with $150,000 of
[19:30] debt close to $100,000 on our house and
[19:32] $50,000 worth of new cars clueless about
[19:35] handling money not a clue around the
[19:38] time Mercy was conceived I said we need
[19:41] a bigger car you everybody thinks you
[19:43] know you're going to have a baby got to
[19:44] have a bigger house and a bigger car all
[19:46] of a sudden cuz like a baby can't fit in
[19:48] a in a small car a baby can't fit in a
[19:50] small house somehow got to have a bigger
[19:52] house bigger car so I was thinking like
[19:54] most people let's go get it some more
[19:56] debt and we already owed money on both
[19:58] their cars cars and I was going to trade
[19:59] one of them in and get even more debt
[20:01] mom and my sister Brooke they said why
[20:03] not consider Dave Ramsey's program so I
[20:06] started listening and I was hooked so we
[20:08] started the program 2009 two years into
[20:10] our marriage we had about $150,000 of
[20:12] debt
[20:14] um and then so this is what that looks
[20:17] like to me okay $150,000 a debt big huge
[20:21] hole like the Grand Canyon and you might
[20:23] think well that's not that much debt
[20:24] Ryan but according to what size our
[20:26] shovel was your shovel in this analogy
[20:28] is your is your is your income we never
[20:31] had a whole lot of income I mean um and
[20:34] it's a fairly modest income it's not
[20:37] 200,000 400,000 a year you know it's
[20:39] very small so um we still lived in that
[20:43] home by say it was 11 years altogether
[20:46] That was supposed to be our starter home
[20:47] we bought that house right before the
[20:49] downturn of the housing market so we
[20:51] were stuck cuz the value of the home
[20:53] dropped in half and it stayed down our
[20:56] area did not recover for about 11 years
[20:58] I don't know know why it took so long to
[20:59] recover but it was about 11 years we had
[21:01] all four of our kids there six people
[21:05] one bathroom two bedrooms in that
[21:09] 800t Matchbox little shoe box and here
[21:12] we are trying to pay off debt and trying
[21:14] to get ahead we sold our cars we paid
[21:16] them off and bought used cars and that
[21:18] helped us Advance quite a bit but we
[21:20] still had that mortgage hanging over our
[21:21] heads so I'm chunking little shovels
[21:23] into this Grand Canyon little $100 bills
[21:25] here and there it feels like it's just
[21:26] going into thin air but like the ant
[21:29] like all my examples I'm giving daunting
[21:32] task if you just make a little every day
[21:35] little bit every day keep chunking keep
[21:37] chunking here we are today mortgage paid
[21:41] off as of two weeks ago paid our last
[21:45] bit of our
[21:48] mortgage and I'll say by the grace of
[21:50] God because the mathematically it was
[21:53] impossible with what I was making having
[21:55] medical bills IA is a debt collector she
[21:59] since she's been born for 10 years bless
[22:01] her heart she's been in out of the
[22:03] hospital and had surgeries and had all
[22:04] kind of medical issues so we've averaged
[22:08] $8 to $10,000 on some years out of
[22:10] pocket um after insurance pays their
[22:12] part and then trying to chunk towards
[22:15] the mortgage and all that it just didn't
[22:16] seem like mathematically it was even
[22:18] possible and it wasn't it was totally
[22:20] impossible but we just kept on our
[22:22] diligent way sacrificing not much eating
[22:25] out at all and very seldom a vacation
[22:28] you know just like brother John said
[22:29] Trisha you sacrifice to win we did our
[22:32] part but then God did his part because
[22:34] people would give us gifts not thousands
[22:37] of dollars just you know little bit here
[22:39] a little bit there and we didn't need it
[22:40] so we chunk it at the mortgage chunk it
[22:42] at the mortgage chunk it at the mortgage
[22:44] uh we still have a little bit of medical
[22:45] debt so we're not technically debt free
[22:47] but we're mortgage free as of a couple
[22:49] weeks ago so thank the Lord for that and
[22:50] that's our house where we currently live
[22:52] our double double wide which is double
[22:54] the size of our last house pretty much
[22:56] double everything that we had
[23:01] so to me I let me read this scripture
[23:03] then I'll get on to that other example
[23:05] God calls Cyrus Isaiah 45 thus sayith
[23:07] the Lord to his anointed to Cyrus whose
[23:09] right hand I have Holden to subdue
[23:11] Nations before him and I will loose the
[23:13] loins of Kings to open before him the
[23:15] two Le Gates and the gates shall not be
[23:17] shut I will go before thee and make the
[23:20] Crooked places straight I will break in
[23:23] pieces the gates of brass and cut in
[23:24] under the bars of iron and I will give
[23:27] Thee the treasures of Darkness think of
[23:28] about the mysteries of the kingdom of
[23:30] God um the Revelation that's been made
[23:32] available to us he'll give us that and
[23:34] hidden Riches of secret places and that
[23:36] thou mayest know that I the Lord which
[23:38] call thee by name am the god of Israel
[23:41] amen I didn't feel like some kind of
[23:43] champion when we paid off our mortgage I
[23:46] cried and I thought Lord we're like the
[23:48] Special Olympics I I got to see these
[23:50] some of the children in the Special
[23:51] Olympics several years ago and it really
[23:53] really uh inspired me how they put so
[23:55] much effort and and everybody knows
[23:57] they're incapable of maybe competing
[23:59] against you know fairly you know more
[24:02] athletic kid normal kid or whatever but
[24:04] yet they give it their all and they try
[24:07] their best and everybody just cheers for
[24:09] them cuz like like they did something
[24:11] you know and that's how I felt at the
[24:13] end of that that I gave my best but God
[24:15] did what I couldn't do you
[24:19] know um and sort of like Ruth uh in the
[24:23] story in BO Ruth chapter 2 and Boaz said
[24:26] unto her at M time Come Thou hither and
[24:28] eat of the bread and dip thy morsel in
[24:30] the vinegar and she sat beside the
[24:32] Reapers and reached her he reached her
[24:35] parch corn and she did eat and was
[24:37] sufficed and left and when she was risen
[24:38] up to glean Boaz commanded his young men
[24:41] saying let her glean even among the
[24:43] sheaths and reproach her not and let
[24:47] fall some of the handfuls of purpose
[24:50] think about Revelation amen of these
[24:52] Mysteries and leave them that she may
[24:54] glean them and rebuke her not and she
[24:56] brought home I think it was um an epha
[24:59] of barley which is 30 lb is quite a bit
[25:01] for a little Ru to carry 30 lb or 6
[25:04] gallons so my point is there that God
[25:07] makes up for our shortcomings like Ruth
[25:10] she was just doing her best to reap but
[25:11] they were leaving her these handfuls of
[25:13] purpose along the way something that she
[25:15] couldn't do in
[25:16] herself taunting tasks $1.2 million
[25:20] that's a lot of money to make I've made
[25:21] roughly 1.2 million at fiale but that's
[25:24] been over 23 years so how do you make
[25:26] $1.2 million at a time started off there
[25:30] seven bucks an hour that was a big pay
[25:32] raise from Derry spot making five bucks
[25:34] an hour but it's just been a dollar at a
[25:36] time never made $1,000 at a time never
[25:38] made 10,000 at a time I've driven 1.2
[25:41] million miles that's a daunting task
[25:43] seems like a lot of miles I never drove
[25:46] a th000 at a time never drove 10,000 at
[25:48] a time I drive one mile at a time which
[25:51] is 50 trips around the Earth 2 and a
[25:52] half trips to the
[25:53] Moon that's what it looks like driving
[25:56] is incredibly boring no no matter what
[25:58] you do is incredibly boring there's no
[26:02] denying
[26:03] it so that's striving the one thing fun
[26:07] I wear a seat belt by the way this was
[26:08] at a stop I was at a farm so I just love
[26:12] my job just because I get to spend time
[26:14] of the Lord but it's incredibly boring
[26:16] but anyway one mile at a time is how you
[26:18] drive 1.2 million miles y'all are
[26:21] familiar with this I I'm going to have
[26:22] to close but um brother Dell's quoted
[26:24] this over the years many times SC
[26:26] Field's notes Here a mystery in
[26:27] Scripture is a previously hidden truth
[26:30] now divinely revealed but in which the
[26:32] supernatural element Still Remains
[26:34] despite the Revelation and y'all can
[26:36] look at that list and I say almost
[26:37] everybody in here knows something about
[26:39] some of those things because the word
[26:41] that's been made revealed to you and
[26:43] just take that to heart and and thank
[26:45] God for the word that's been revealed
[26:46] and just keep going CU in all these
[26:48] Mysteries there's more to be revealed
[26:50] yes brother Dell uh our musicians if
[26:53] you'll start making your way up here
[26:54] please this is Brother Dale from about 5
[26:56] years ago uh 2019 September 15th on
[26:59] salvation same material if you can get
[27:02] to that point to understand what faith
[27:04] really is then it'll be easy to be able
[27:05] to say add virtue because it's the same
[27:08] material all right it's not a different
[27:10] material it's the same material added to
[27:12] it virtue the knowledge will be the same
[27:14] material Temperance patience godliness
[27:16] it'll all be the same material so you're
[27:19] not having to try to figure out if
[27:21] you'll just ever find out what faith
[27:23] really is and get that in your
[27:25] understanding then you'll see that what
[27:27] these virtues really are it's just
[27:28] adding Faith to Faith to Faith to Faith
[27:31] Revelation to Revelation Daily Bread
[27:34] here a little there a little opening of
[27:36] God's word to each one of
[27:39] us brother bam gives an example about an
[27:41] arcade uh in Jehovah J number one when I
[27:44] got filled with the Holy Ghost if you
[27:45] people did uh like you people did I like
[27:48] to walk through and like a big arcade
[27:50] everything there belongs to me I'm air
[27:52] of every bit of it I like to find out
[27:54] what I got become a become a Christian I
[27:56] want to know what I own
[27:59] if I had an arcade I go through pull out
[28:01] a drawer and see what's in here and look
[28:02] over here see what's in there something
[28:05] seemed a bit too high for me I'd get me
[28:06] a step ladder and climb up to it I find
[28:09] out what it was something seems a little
[28:11] beyond my reach I get on my knees and
[28:13] start praying till I Rise up to it it
[28:15] belongs to me God promised it right
[28:18] Divine Healing the power of God brother
[28:20] Wade and others have been talking about
[28:21] power of God and all these materials or
[28:23] miracles signs and wonders he promised
[28:26] it so again knocking will be opened seek
[28:29] and you shall find oh yeah number of
[28:32] chickens hauled 65 million chickens
[28:33] that's a lot of chickens for one little
[28:35] guy to haul by myself we don't do team
[28:38] drivers that's me 65 million so think
[28:42] about the tortoise in the hair I like
[28:43] that example because if you've read the
[28:45] story of The Tortoise and the hair they
[28:46] were in race and uh the tortoise was not
[28:50] adequate to win that in his own power
[28:53] but because of the pride of that hair
[28:56] the Taurus being in persever and just
[28:58] keeping on keeping on his Daily Bread he
[29:00] finally won that race so be the tortoise
[29:03] don't be the hair God bless you thank
[29:05] you amen
