[0:00] we'd be able to at least get one service
[0:01] in so i think that's been
[0:04] that's been given to us and i know
[0:05] you're praying too i i hope you weren't
[0:07] sitting there praying we get six inches
[0:09] of snow on the ground
[0:11] can't come to church but that's all
[0:14] right and some of you that are listening
[0:16] in are watching then good to have you
[0:17] with us today and
[0:19] in the very comfort of ease of your home
[0:21] just put your feet up and pay attention
[0:24] revelations six let's go to
[0:27] verse nine and we'll talk about the
[0:29] fifth seal again this will be part
[0:30] three uh remember next sunday
[0:34] we'll only be having one service um
[0:38] our sunday schools will be at 9 45 we're
[0:40] going to make sure and do our sunday
[0:42] school
[0:44] gift exchange hurriedly and
[0:47] so they can do the christmas program so
[0:50] all of us that have sunday school
[0:51] classes
[0:54] try to be done by 10 o'clock and and up
[0:56] here
[0:57] by 10 o'clock and or let the children go
[0:59] wherever they need to go
[1:01] so be real short abbreviated sunday
[1:04] school class but it'll just be for
[1:06] exchanging the gifts and and stuff like
[1:09] that so also remember
[1:10] next luis when you're leaving
[1:14] 14th friday remember
[1:17] circle that on your calendar brother
[1:18] louise sister christine and the girls
[1:21] are all going to honduras
[1:23] so remember them on their travels
[1:27] they'll be here wednesday night but also
[1:28] i'd like to
[1:30] uh say if you have something extra to
[1:32] give them
[1:33] uh he'll be out of work i mean it just
[1:35] costs money to go overseas it doesn't
[1:37] matter what
[1:38] so if you got a little extra to give him
[1:40] just hand it to him and
[1:42] or you can either write a check and lisa
[1:44] can give it to him she's
[1:45] nodding her head back there so you you
[1:47] can do that also but
[1:50] it's always good to have a little
[1:51] traveling money in your pocket like
[1:54] daddy always says he
[1:55] he calls it his rat hole he's got a
[1:56] couple of couple of dead presidents
[1:58] wrapped up under in his billfold
[2:00] somewhere
[2:01] all the time sophia and we've needed it
[2:03] there's been times we've been places we
[2:05] needed
[2:05] that rat hole money so it's always good
[2:07] to have a little extra but uh
[2:09] uh hey you can't put money on a soul
[2:13] you can't put money on us all and if he
[2:15] can go over there and just
[2:16] just one soul receive something then uh
[2:20] all the money in the world can't buy
[2:21] that so we pray that brother luis will
[2:23] have a wonderful time he
[2:25] he's uh doing a good job with those
[2:29] hispanic brothers and and being able to
[2:31] speak their language there's no language
[2:33] barrier there so he's able to uh
[2:36] boy i really enjoyed that wednesday
[2:37] night i i'd like to have that brother
[2:40] back and sit down and talk to him for a
[2:41] few
[2:42] few weeks you know and get to know him a
[2:44] little bit better but you know what if
[2:45] we don't hear we know
[2:46] for an eternity we'll be able to sit
[2:48] down and
[2:49] talk and reminisce about what happened
[2:52] down here and
[2:54] there won't be any language barrier you
[2:55] know what he'll hear me in my english
[2:57] i mean he'll hear me in spanish and i'll
[3:00] hear him in english it's not gonna be
[3:01] any language barrier there so
[3:04] oh you think we all going to speak
[3:06] english when we get over there no
[3:07] they're going to speak their native
[3:08] language
[3:09] that's the way they were raised but
[3:10] you're going to hear it in your tongue
[3:12] that's what happened on the day of
[3:12] pentecost
[3:13] right it's what happened showing that
[3:15] that's what's going to happen in the
[3:16] future home
[3:17] is everybody's going to hear them in
[3:19] their own native language whether they
[3:20] may be speaking
[3:22] hispanic or what more but you're hearing
[3:23] it in your there'll be no language
[3:25] barrier there
[3:26] so we thank god for that thank god for a
[3:29] prophet
[3:30] they brought us these little tidbits and
[3:33] on what's gonna happen
[3:34] like we were talking about hearing that
[3:36] last sunday about going across the
[3:38] curtain of time and
[3:39] you know paul wrote briefly about it but
[3:41] brother branham come back and he
[3:42] kept telling us about it kept telling us
[3:44] about going across because paul says you
[3:46] know i don't know whether i was caught
[3:47] up here there saw things i couldn't talk
[3:49] about
[3:50] well brother branham went across and
[3:51] come back and he talked about a lot
[3:54] that went on that made up a lot of
[3:57] a lot of things that went on helped him
[3:59] a lot and we'll read them again this
[4:00] afternoon
[4:01] to get a a little more of a background
[4:04] and then we're going to talk today about
[4:06] the seal
[4:07] the seal itself the fifth seal you know
[4:09] we always wrap up the little
[4:10] wrap up the little paper and put the
[4:12] seal on it well the sea the fifth seal
[4:14] is what we're fixing to read here and
[4:16] then we're going to just give you that
[4:17] overview today
[4:18] then we're going to dig into i believe
[4:20] is the thunder behind the seal
[4:22] maybe next not next sunday but maybe the
[4:25] sunday after that because we'll have
[4:26] just one service next week so
[4:28] revelation 6 verse 9 let's bow our heads
[4:31] before we get started dear lord
[4:33] thank you for this day thank you for
[4:35] this
[4:37] time of of just sitting under
[4:42] the anointing of the holy ghost
[4:43] everybody brought their lick of fire
[4:46] everybody coming under expectation so
[4:49] lord we're just going to receive
[4:50] something from me because you said where
[4:52] two or three are gathered in your name
[4:53] you will be in the midst and we lord
[4:56] believe
[4:56] that you've sent us a message in this
[4:59] hour
[5:00] and this message is to be as the brother
[5:02] said wednesday night the final voice to
[5:04] the final age
[5:06] has to come through a living a living
[5:08] message a living ministry not dead
[5:10] letter
[5:12] lord we pray today that you'll open back
[5:14] lord our eyes and give us revelation
[5:16] use the eye salve lord of the holy ghost
[5:19] to
[5:20] break back the scales just for a few
[5:22] minutes and not worry about the
[5:24] conditions outside and all the things
[5:26] that's going to go on next week lord but
[5:27] let's just for a few minutes
[5:29] enter into eternity and just watch you
[5:31] do your work
[5:33] father forgive us of our sins be with
[5:35] the ones that are sick
[5:36] be with the missionaries on the foreign
[5:38] field to give them fruit for their labor
[5:39] father
[5:40] we ask that you just take care of us be
[5:43] with brother luis as he travels and the
[5:44] family lord just bless them
[5:46] give them fruit for their labor father
[5:48] we ask all these things in the name of
[5:49] jesus christ
[5:51] amen revelation 6 9 and when he had
[5:53] opened the fifth seal
[5:55] i saw under the altar the souls of them
[5:58] that were slain for the word of god and
[5:59] for the testimony
[6:01] which they held and they cried with a
[6:02] loud voice saying how long o lord
[6:05] holy and true thus thou not judge and
[6:07] avenge our blood
[6:08] on them that dwell on the earth they
[6:11] asked them a question
[6:12] and white robes were given unto every
[6:14] one of them and it was said unto them
[6:15] that they should rest yet for a little
[6:17] season
[6:18] until their fellow servant also and
[6:20] their brethren that should be killed
[6:21] as they were should be fulfilled
[6:25] you may be seated in the lord as
[6:27] blessing we're going to
[6:29] try to dramatize this a little bit maybe
[6:32] after we give a uh
[6:35] give a little overview from last sunday
[6:36] if that's okay
[6:40] i mean it's not going to get dark till
[6:42] five o'clock so we okay
[6:49] all right brother joe yeah
[6:52] thank you buddy
[6:57] but we're
[7:01] there we go so we've been talking about
[7:03] starting on the fifth steel this is part
[7:05] three and we saw last sunday
[7:08] where that seal number one was the white
[7:12] horse rider seal number two the red
[7:13] horse rider number three the black horse
[7:14] rider seal number four we went through
[7:16] all that
[7:18] and remember we're caught up
[7:21] on the for sale that all right say amen
[7:24] amen so on the fourth seal that is
[7:29] and keep this in your mind that's the
[7:30] total of the gentile dispensation
[7:34] okay because it's the seven church ages
[7:36] and we'll just you know from here to
[7:37] here
[7:38] we'll go two three four five six seven
[7:41] that's
[7:42] that's all we're allotted is seven
[7:44] church ages
[7:45] the gentiles right and we were given the
[7:48] holy ghost
[7:50] on the day of pentecost to lead us
[7:53] through those seven church ages under
[7:55] revelation of the son of god all right
[7:58] this is
[7:58] all background under the revelation of
[8:00] the son of god
[8:01] believe on the lord jesus christ and
[8:03] thou shalt be saved and as many as were
[8:05] added
[8:06] they were added daily people were
[8:08] baptized in the name of jesus christ
[8:10] and god anointed seven men
[8:14] seven church age messengers to bring
[8:17] that message
[8:18] that all right and it was the four
[8:21] horse riders that went riding out in
[8:23] opposition
[8:24] to the four beasts or combat beasts
[8:28] that are the lion ox man and eagle and
[8:31] then we know the lion was here
[8:33] the ox here the man age here and then
[8:35] you and i are in the eagle age
[8:38] so we're in the age of flight we're in
[8:40] the age of leaving the ground
[8:42] right here sure a lion can jump you know
[8:46] an ox can't jump very high uh man can
[8:50] artificially do things but he still
[8:53] can't fly like an eagle he can't just
[8:54] stand right here and take off and fly
[8:56] across the grand canyon we were
[8:58] there last year and and man what a
[9:00] spectacle the grand canyon you just
[9:02] can't describe it in pictures and
[9:04] anything any words but you know what you
[9:06] stand right on the edge
[9:08] brother john and you want that big rail
[9:10] around you
[9:13] hey man that big rail i don't want some
[9:16] little bitty pencil thing that i you
[9:17] know around the edge why
[9:19] because i can't fly but a bird just
[9:22] comes and sits right there on the
[9:24] on the rock beside you and he sees his
[9:26] friend out there in the middle of the
[9:28] grand canyon you know what he doesn't
[9:29] look around and go
[9:30] well i let me make sure that i'm prayed
[9:34] up and make sure
[9:35] no he just goes and man he just sails
[9:39] out through there and you know what
[9:40] brother larry it doesn't matter if it's
[9:41] 10 miles deep or a mile deep it doesn't
[9:43] matter to him he's just looking down
[9:44] going man this is good
[9:45] well that's the way you and i are
[9:46] supposed to be that's why i told you
[9:50] that we have when we come into this
[9:52] fifth seal it's got to be in a
[9:54] supernatural realm
[9:55] and and we'll get talk about something
[9:57] in just a minute um that may help us on
[9:59] that
[10:00] but uh i knew
[10:03] when we started and i'm going to start
[10:06] doing this
[10:07] i'm going to start when when i get a an
[10:09] unction i'm going to start writing it
[10:11] down and put it in an envelope sealing
[10:12] it
[10:13] and putting it up somewhere and let you
[10:14] read it after that happens because i
[10:16] knew we would have a
[10:18] big distraction when we started the
[10:21] fifth seal
[10:22] i knew it i could have wrote it down and
[10:24] on a piece of paper sealed it up and
[10:26] put it in an envelope and put it in a
[10:28] safe and you could have read it right
[10:30] because a lot of you are are are having
[10:32] a problem with the
[10:34] the altar call thing and the prayer line
[10:35] thing and you know that's just something
[10:37] you're gonna have to get over
[10:38] right because i got some quotes in here
[10:41] this really will stir your water
[10:43] brother brown says i do not believe in
[10:45] altar calls
[10:47] never have believed in altar call
[10:50] he said it's not ever been in the bible
[10:53] but see now when you start thinking that
[10:55] you go oh
[10:55] see you everybody clicks their computer
[10:57] off like brother dale said you click a
[10:59] computer off
[11:00] you say well you're just wrong really
[11:03] i'm just reading you what the prophet
[11:05] said i'm just telling you what he's
[11:07] fixing to tell you in a few minutes
[11:09] under the anointing of the holy ghost he
[11:12] says
[11:12] i don't believe in altar calls
[11:17] but see i knew that would be a
[11:18] distraction i knew that would come a
[11:20] distraction i just didn't know how
[11:22] so there you go there's the distraction
[11:24] everybody is
[11:25] not everybody but a lot of people you
[11:27] can you know you can say what you want
[11:29] to but we're going to have to have a
[11:30] different thought process to get us out
[11:32] of here
[11:33] because the thought process we're under
[11:34] now is not working
[11:37] it's not working right you know why it's
[11:40] not working
[11:41] because i still go to funerals
[11:44] that's right so it's not working
[11:47] something's not working
[11:49] so we got to try to find something
[11:50] that'll work and you know what
[11:52] it's not a ouija board it's not some
[11:54] kind of uh
[11:55] well we'll we'll see if go to this and
[11:57] go no it's already in the bible
[11:59] god's already told us how to act but we
[12:03] took
[12:03] tradition listen
[12:07] that's what's in these ages that's what
[12:08] i was trying to tell you next
[12:10] last sunday we got to get out of that
[12:12] tradition
[12:15] tradition has put look
[12:18] no shame in people being in the grave
[12:21] but you see that mark in that mark you
[12:23] and i
[12:24] are right about and you can't see it in
[12:26] the back because they ain't much of a
[12:27] wine but you and i are right there
[12:31] there's just like a paper white thin
[12:34] edge between the rapture and us
[12:37] they're waiting on you and i
[12:40] they're waiting according to hebrews 11
[12:42] 40
[12:43] that they here's they you may write that
[12:46] they
[12:48] they without us cannot be made perfect
[12:53] they're missing a piece they're missing
[12:55] a part
[12:56] because what happened is their tradition
[12:58] put them in the ground
[13:01] i'm sorry their tradition is what put
[13:04] them in the ground right
[13:06] but the son of man revelation is not
[13:08] going to put us in the ground it's going
[13:09] to take us
[13:10] up you think when jesus walked up to the
[13:13] pharisees like i said last week and it's
[13:14] going to tie in with what we're talking
[13:16] about today
[13:18] because god came to the jews first
[13:23] he came to his own and his own received
[13:25] him not now we know jesus wasn't a jew
[13:28] but he was born under jewry he was born
[13:30] under the old testament he was born in
[13:32] israel or bethlehem so he was born
[13:35] amongst his people
[13:37] he came to his own and his own received
[13:39] him not
[13:40] but such as did receive him them he gave
[13:43] eternal life
[13:44] why they didn't stick with the tradition
[13:47] of the old testament because there was
[13:48] no eternal life in the old testament
[13:50] there was no eternal life in the the
[13:53] torah
[13:54] never made one person eternal right
[13:57] right
[13:58] but when the man that wrote it come on
[14:01] the scene he was
[14:02] so different than their tradition
[14:07] they called him a devil he was god
[14:11] so you know what i i'm i'm just gonna
[14:14] say it
[14:16] if you say i'm wrong and if you say that
[14:19] i'm not
[14:20] with the tradition of the church thank
[14:22] god
[14:23] thank you you have took me out of that
[14:25] tradition
[14:27] of the old church maybe somebody is
[14:30] going to see a revelation they've never
[14:32] seen before
[14:33] right and you know what people are going
[14:34] to talk about you
[14:36] that's okay they called him belgium
[14:38] brother brown said he said they called
[14:39] him belgian bubby so what about you
[14:42] because they called brother brown of the
[14:43] devil why here he goes
[14:46] under the tradition of the pentecostals
[14:52] they accepted him until he started
[14:53] preaching the word
[14:56] against their what not the bible
[14:59] against their tradition brother branham
[15:03] was bringing the word
[15:04] word by word by word and they turned him
[15:07] down for
[15:08] that right not anything else
[15:12] he was accepted for the healing he was
[15:14] accepting for and he made altar
[15:16] calls
[15:19] and i'll read you in a few minutes he
[15:20] said i made them and i'll probably still
[15:22] make them he said but it is
[15:23] not according to the bible
[15:27] not according to the bible
[15:31] okay it's not there's not one article in
[15:33] the bible right
[15:34] there's not one prayer line in the bible
[15:38] not one what is it it's a tradition that
[15:41] we put in
[15:42] right the method is put off to cause
[15:44] reason i'm telling you this because when
[15:45] we say
[15:46] and read that scripture their souls unto
[15:48] the altar crying how long
[15:50] every one of you thought about this did
[15:53] you not
[15:55] what else did you think about this is
[15:58] not the altar he's talking about
[16:03] there never was an altar in the old
[16:05] testament or either in the new testament
[16:08] yeah there was a a box
[16:12] that was called the holy of holies that
[16:14] was the altar but that was a box
[16:17] this thing right over here
[16:21] that thing
[16:24] right but that wasn't an altar that
[16:27] anybody went and prayed to
[16:29] no no they believed the bible says
[16:33] brother brown said yeah in the new
[16:34] testament the bible says
[16:36] they believed and many were added as
[16:38] many as believed were added
[16:40] to the church not an altar call but when
[16:42] you say souls under the altar crying how
[16:45] long it's like they're here and they're
[16:46] crying
[16:47] but i'll read you in just a minute when
[16:50] we get into this
[16:51] that that's not the altar does not mean
[16:53] that
[16:56] there's only one place to meet christ
[16:58] and that's at calvary
[17:00] man has made it a tradition of the altar
[17:02] with the cross
[17:04] and you coming to the altar
[17:07] but the altar has always been in your
[17:09] heart
[17:11] always been in your heart he's always
[17:14] wanted to get to this altar not this one
[17:16] that's why i said this one makes you
[17:18] weak because you depend on this one
[17:21] not this one you gotta depend on this
[17:24] altar
[17:26] the altar of your heart is more
[17:27] important than any brick mortar would or
[17:30] whatever you want to make
[17:35] it's going to help us get out of here
[17:37] because if we don't build our faith up
[17:38] how are we going to have faith enough
[17:40] for a body change right amen
[17:44] i'm just saying but remember
[17:48] when we come to this fifth seal it's out
[17:52] of the church ages
[17:54] aren't we supposed to be called out of
[17:55] the church age right we're supposed to
[17:57] be called out
[17:58] there's no fifth seal under the church
[18:00] age there's not even a
[18:01] literal fifth seal under the church
[18:03] agent
[18:06] it's it's in another dimension right
[18:09] it's not covered by a
[18:10] line of man and eagle it's not covered
[18:12] by ryreneus martin club and all those
[18:14] sure those people were underneath there
[18:16] but when we get to this place that we're
[18:18] going to talk about
[18:22] this bar their souls here
[18:26] under the altar
[18:29] crying how long they're not under the
[18:31] altar of paul irenaeus do you understand
[18:33] what i mean
[18:33] these are not christian people
[18:36] in the fifth seal that's not christian
[18:38] people
[18:40] never has been never will be
[18:43] right what robes were given them
[18:49] given them that didn't make them
[18:51] christians
[18:52] they christians are live people that has
[18:54] christ living in them in this dimension
[18:57] they were christians at antioch they
[19:00] were christians at spoken word church
[19:02] because we have what
[19:03] christ in us the hope of glory this
[19:06] group here did not have that
[19:09] now according to what i read you last
[19:11] sunday brother branham thought that was
[19:14] the souls of these church age people
[19:20] under the altar of god
[19:25] i read you i'm gonna read it to you
[19:26] again just to make sure because watch
[19:28] let's read
[19:30] let's go to number two guys just to
[19:34] skip through this because see the
[19:37] mystery we're going to talk about the
[19:38] mystery of the seal not what's
[19:40] underneath but the
[19:40] whole mystery of the seal fifth steel
[19:43] brother ram said well now i get started
[19:44] on them subjects we're just talking to
[19:46] people around the wall standing
[19:48] so i'll get right straight to the
[19:49] message now i want to give thanks to him
[19:51] who's on the present
[19:52] now look remember brother branham's
[19:54] thought process look at me was in this
[19:56] direction right here
[19:59] that was the souls of christian people
[20:02] under the altar of sacrifice waiting on
[20:05] the re on the resurrection
[20:07] crying how long you see my hand
[20:12] that's not true according to that
[20:16] so why are we still doing this
[20:21] because brother brown said now i want to
[20:22] give thanks to him who's on the prison
[20:24] that's why brother bryan said i've never
[20:25] worked in a realm like this before not
[20:27] healings not anything
[20:28] but what god pulling him toward
[20:31] the correct revelation of the word
[20:36] and it stays that way brother louise you
[20:38] know what it never changed
[20:39] it never changed in the bible
[20:43] that's always been there where did it
[20:45] change in the thought process of the
[20:47] prophet
[20:48] right and then in changing the thought
[20:51] process of the prophet
[20:52] it changed our thought process that's
[20:55] when the seal opens and becomes personal
[20:57] to you
[20:59] it was personal to him but look at us
[21:01] now 50 something years later
[21:04] it's personal to you it's personal to me
[21:06] it should be personal to all of us
[21:09] and that today not knowing one thing
[21:11] about that fifth seal it came in that
[21:13] same mysterious way this morning just an
[21:15] hour before
[21:16] daylight when i was out in prayer now
[21:18] let's go to number three
[21:20] excuse me let's just skip to all that
[21:25] why isn't there one here he's talking
[21:27] about here going up to the next
[21:29] paragraph right there we know he's
[21:32] talking about the horse riders are gone
[21:34] everybody oh you know all the horse
[21:36] riders are done so in other words the
[21:38] church ages at that time has to be over
[21:42] okay we've already took a we've already
[21:44] took a rapture we revelations 4 1 we
[21:46] have went up through the door open door
[21:49] then god starts dealing with the jews
[21:51] well see he's
[21:53] he's dealing with the jews because
[21:54] that's what these people are these are
[21:56] not christians right
[21:57] these are jews is that all right
[22:01] and we we the reason there's no one
[22:03] there now we know written because some
[22:05] some reason for something now you
[22:08] remember at the first beginning i said
[22:09] there can't be nothing without a reason
[22:11] remember the little drop of ink now you
[22:13] got to find the reason
[22:14] there was some reason they didn't have
[22:16] to have a beast or a power announced
[22:17] this seal being broke and only god can
[22:19] reveal why
[22:22] because it always in him but the reason
[22:23] that he reveals that i under
[22:25] as i understand that it is because the
[22:27] mystery of the book of redemption as far
[22:29] as the antichrist being revealed
[22:32] and at the same time the church is gone
[22:35] these things don't even happen in the
[22:37] church age at all
[22:40] so we got to see in another dimension we
[22:42] got to change our thought pray what is
[22:44] he doing he's
[22:45] he's changed his thought process all six
[22:48] five days so far first seal
[22:52] he said i was thinking this way
[22:56] and it was totally different second seal
[22:58] i was thinking this way
[22:59] totally different third seal fourth seal
[23:03] fifth seal it all was the same way god
[23:06] was turning
[23:08] brother branham's thought process
[23:11] to just like he said he said you can't
[23:13] change the bible you can't add the seals
[23:14] didn't add the bible it was already
[23:16] written in there
[23:17] it just had to be brought out by a
[23:19] prophet
[23:20] that only only heard from god
[23:25] so buddy i'm telling you it's the line
[23:26] that comes straight from i mean
[23:28] it wasn't hearsay remember what i said
[23:31] about hearsay
[23:33] it wasn't hearsay when that angel came
[23:36] into that room on
[23:37] every morning of those seals and
[23:39] revealed that seal
[23:40] that was god telling the prophet
[23:43] this is what it is
[23:47] and at the same time the church is gone
[23:49] and these things don't even happen in
[23:50] the church age at all that's right
[23:52] they're away from the church age the
[23:54] church absolutely is raptured at this
[23:57] time
[23:57] the church goes up in the fourth chapter
[23:59] of revelation and it does not
[24:02] come back return until it comes back
[24:04] with king in the 19th chapter but these
[24:06] seals here are revealing what has been
[24:08] what is and what will be and now what
[24:11] was to be for the church age was
[24:13] revealed by these seals and now watch
[24:14] what takes place
[24:16] the four stages of his rider has been
[24:17] revealed the four stages of the
[24:18] antichrist has been revealed at this
[24:20] time
[24:21] therefore they don't have to have any
[24:22] more and there's four living creatures
[24:24] announced the riders as they rode
[24:26] four beasts or force powers is that all
[24:28] right now
[24:29] number four here's where brother brown
[24:31] now this is paragraph 215 he's getting
[24:33] into the seal
[24:34] now notice in the ninth ninth verse
[24:36] souls under the altar
[24:38] now here's where i'm going to get some
[24:39] real disagreement but watch just for a
[24:42] minute
[24:42] i thought that too
[24:46] look at me i thought that too that was
[24:48] his thought process
[24:50] right remember he thought me and brother
[24:52] neville can talk to each other but we
[24:54] can't touch each other right
[24:58] but was it that way was it that way at
[25:02] all it was that way
[25:05] totally different he's thinking they're
[25:07] christian souls under the altar
[25:09] and they're souls that are given eternal
[25:10] life that didn't even know jesus christ
[25:12] when they were alive amen
[25:13] amen white horse rider was the holy
[25:17] ghost brother branham no brother brown
[25:19] it was the antichrist that's that way
[25:24] okay so why are we still butting heads
[25:26] this way
[25:28] we gotta turn and go
[25:32] isn't that what repent is turn
[25:35] somebody said one time you gotta turn
[25:36] 360 degrees when you repent i said wait
[25:38] a minute
[25:40] it puts you right back in the same place
[25:42] you're that
[25:43] 180. he meant 180 but he said 360. you
[25:46] got to make a 360.
[25:48] no it's a 180. i thought that too but it
[25:51] didn't come that way
[25:52] i've always thought that these souls
[25:54] under the altar were the martyrs of the
[25:56] early church
[25:57] and i'm sure that dr uriah smith and
[25:59] every one of them says it
[26:00] is see but i thought so myself but when
[26:04] the holy spirit showed the vision to it
[26:06] it wasn't it isn't the souls now you say
[26:09] well i don't know about that well now in
[26:11] just a minute we'll find out
[26:13] these are not the souls of the bride
[26:15] church not at all we thought that was
[26:17] the bride church waiting there souls
[26:19] under the altar crying how long lord
[26:20] how long he thought it was the church
[26:23] age people that had died
[26:26] the bride he said bride he thought it
[26:28] was bride
[26:30] it ain't even close to bride right amen
[26:33] right it's people give an eternal life
[26:35] that don't even didn't even profess
[26:37] jesus on the face of the earth
[26:40] that's why you're going to see that's
[26:41] the greatest show of grace is to give
[26:44] somebody eternal life that didn't even
[26:45] want it
[26:47] didn't even know where that eternal life
[26:48] came from you and i know where eternal
[26:51] life comes from
[26:52] because you and i are possessors of it
[26:54] now we don't have to think wondering
[26:56] anything else
[26:57] it's here now you have your white robe
[27:00] today
[27:03] the day you got born again god put a
[27:05] white robe on you
[27:08] and you don't lose it right
[27:12] let me read it again so we get it right
[27:13] and then he reads the let's just
[27:15] save time come on up to here bring it up
[27:19] see the word of god
[27:21] now let's look at this for they at this
[27:23] time if you notice this fifth seal being
[27:25] open
[27:26] the church is gone so see when the
[27:27] church is gone
[27:29] if you have like in this in the sixth
[27:32] dimension where brother branham went
[27:34] right and they called that souls under
[27:36] the altar but i'm going to read you what
[27:37] the altar is
[27:38] the altar is the cross
[27:41] there is no physical altar that they're
[27:43] sitting there under an
[27:44] altar no they're under the altar of that
[27:47] sacrifice that perpetuation i'll read it
[27:49] to you man it's a word i can't hardly
[27:51] pronounce
[27:52] but it means the one that made the
[27:54] atonement
[27:55] they're actually looking to that
[27:57] atonement they're not looking at a
[27:59] wooden altar that's what our problem is
[28:01] when we say altar what's the first thing
[28:02] we think of
[28:04] right here no right here
[28:08] a flesh altar the altar of sacrifice
[28:12] because jesus gave his flesh he gave his
[28:16] life that's the altar right well that's
[28:19] in other words that's the altar i want
[28:20] to be
[28:21] connected to i won't be connected to
[28:24] christ
[28:25] so see you've got the souls here under
[28:27] the altar in that sixth dimension you've
[28:30] got
[28:31] millions upon millions upon millions
[28:33] right
[28:34] now when the church takes a rapture what
[28:37] happens
[28:38] they leave right
[28:42] don't need redemption anymore
[28:44] redemption's over remember the book of
[28:45] redemption is done
[28:47] when he takes that book the last one
[28:49] comes in
[28:50] the redemption for the gentiles is over
[28:54] so all them souls come out of that sixth
[28:56] dimension into this dimension
[28:58] get their flesh bodies again glorified
[29:02] you and i that have had something to do
[29:04] with the resurrection we get a glorified
[29:06] body
[29:07] and we just step over into another
[29:09] dimension if you want to say we go back
[29:10] in the sixth dimension that's fine
[29:11] because that's a good safe place to be
[29:14] well god wipes the rest of this off
[29:15] right but it has nothing
[29:17] to do with this this fifth seal
[29:21] nothing now brother branham put all of
[29:24] the ones that passed on
[29:26] in the bride under that and that was not
[29:28] true
[29:30] false that was not true
[29:34] this is the souls of people that had the
[29:36] we'll break it down
[29:38] it said they had the word of god you
[29:39] know what they had they had old
[29:40] testament they were jews
[29:43] they had the ten commandments they had
[29:45] we have moses
[29:47] right but they never knew jesus christ
[29:49] so they couldn't be
[29:50] this couldn't be the altar under the
[29:53] altar that the
[29:54] sixth seal i mean the fifth sixth
[29:56] dimension when brother brown went to
[29:57] sixth dimension
[29:59] it's totally two different places
[30:01] because this can't be in the sixth
[30:03] dimension folks
[30:06] these people are given robes the ones in
[30:08] the sixth dimension right now
[30:10] already have their robes okay
[30:13] that okay the church is gone it just
[30:17] can't be the souls under the early
[30:18] church now please if you ever did give
[30:20] this attention now because this is a
[30:21] great
[30:22] controversy so i want you to listen real
[30:24] close
[30:25] and you got your pencils to paper to
[30:26] write it down now these cannot be them
[30:28] souls because the souls of the righteous
[30:31] martyred and the righteous people the
[30:32] church the bride has done been took up
[30:35] amen
[30:35] so they wouldn't be under the altar
[30:39] they'd be in glory with the bride now
[30:42] watch
[30:42] for they are gone in the rapture in the
[30:44] fourth chapter of revelations
[30:46] they are taken up all right so now
[30:50] remember what we were talking about last
[30:53] sunday
[30:55] when this seal opens to us it has to
[30:58] open in a supernatural way because it's
[31:00] not going to open naturally to us
[31:03] so we need to get the thunder that's
[31:04] underneath that we need to get the
[31:06] revelation but we're going to stay with
[31:07] the
[31:08] seal first today we'll talk about the
[31:10] revelation later but that fifth seal
[31:12] is a place to hold a group of people
[31:16] a real special group of people
[31:21] how else can you say it right it's a
[31:23] real special group of people
[31:26] all right has nothing to do with
[31:27] christendom right
[31:31] in other words this can't happen though
[31:32] until we're gone
[31:34] they without us cannot be made perfect i
[31:36] just feel that we have something to do
[31:38] with this
[31:39] in the whole scheme of things amen
[31:43] i said in the whole scheme of things if
[31:45] that breaks to us
[31:46] and we see grace it's got to be graced
[31:48] us first
[31:51] where jesus christ may manifest in
[31:53] another form folks
[31:54] okay maybe we'll get in maybe we'll
[31:57] start believing that
[31:59] all right look brother brown talks in
[32:02] questions and answers 1953 number five
[32:07] now remember though let me make a point
[32:09] here as we
[32:11] as the ones that have went on across the
[32:12] curtain of time are in a theophany body
[32:15] right right but you can feel them you
[32:18] can hear them
[32:19] they can talk sure amen because brother
[32:22] branham i'm more regional when he went
[32:23] across the curtain of time he hugged him
[32:24] he knew they were women in other words
[32:27] he could feel them but there was no
[32:30] problem
[32:31] because here's the problem first three
[32:33] dimensions this is the problem
[32:34] there is no problem anywhere else okay
[32:38] but those people excuse me
[32:42] contact got out of sorts there for a
[32:44] minute but remember these people
[32:46] they were there in that sixth dimension
[32:48] and then when we
[32:49] leave that's theophanies that have come
[32:52] back and now have a glorified body
[32:56] right when that sixth dimension empties
[32:59] up when the resurrection happens when
[33:01] they come among us they're not going to
[33:02] be spirits
[33:05] they're going to be in their theophany
[33:07] body
[33:09] amen touch them
[33:12] hold them they'll even be able to eat
[33:17] jesus did when he resurrected didn't he
[33:20] he said give me some fish
[33:22] but then our bodies will be changed
[33:28] so everything's waiting on me and you to
[33:31] do something
[33:33] the lord doing it through us to get them
[33:35] into this dimension
[33:36] but it has nothing to do with this as
[33:39] far as
[33:40] these are not our people right
[33:43] but i think under all of redemption
[33:45] because brother mean talks about the
[33:46] book of redemption in the fifth seal all
[33:48] under redemption
[33:49] then they're waiting on us right amen
[33:52] for something to happen
[33:55] amen because listen
[33:58] if we don't see grace in its higher in
[34:00] its highest form
[34:01] you'll never see how these people make
[34:03] it because me and you i'm telling you
[34:05] if it was left up to me and you they
[34:07] won't make it right
[34:09] i'm talking about me and you humanly
[34:12] that one inside of me
[34:13] is saying hallelujah thank god there is
[34:16] grace
[34:17] for a group of people that didn't want
[34:18] it but if you look at us
[34:20] out in the world and you meet a bunch of
[34:23] people
[34:24] this is all that old messiah he was
[34:26] nothing
[34:27] that's in people in that dimension right
[34:28] there that's going to be given eternal
[34:31] life because they were a jew and they
[34:34] were persecuted
[34:35] and their daddy literally blinded their
[34:38] eyes
[34:38] right so they couldn't see see that's
[34:42] the to me that's the mystery
[34:44] glory where am i at
[34:47] i can't touch brother neville up there
[34:49] now this is in 1953
[34:51] questions and answers now they know each
[34:54] other but they can't talk and shake
[34:55] hands now watch he stopped himself
[34:58] because they said how long how long he
[35:01] stopped himself right here look
[35:02] says they can't talk and shake hands oh
[35:05] i beg
[35:06] they could talk cause he just said they
[35:07] did right he couldn't deny what he just
[35:09] read right
[35:10] all right so he had to back up on that
[35:13] they could talk
[35:14] but they couldn't shake hands and so
[35:16] forth oh my
[35:19] that's the old thing we you know that's
[35:21] the old thing we've thought hearts
[35:23] harps on a on a cloud floating along you
[35:26] know and saying hey brother neville hey
[35:27] brother branham hey brother so-and-so
[35:29] hey brothers on something
[35:30] it ain't and you know what
[35:34] that was this thought process right here
[35:38] same way with you know mama's walking
[35:40] the streets of gold
[35:42] hand in hand with jesus well that's not
[35:44] true
[35:46] right we'll be true later on but right
[35:49] now they're in the sixth dimension they
[35:50] can't even see jesus
[35:52] if they're born again right so that must
[35:55] be this way
[35:57] that's why we have been turned that's
[36:00] why i told you brother random
[36:01] brother god through william branham went
[36:04] into the womb of our mind and totally
[36:06] turned us
[36:08] to the right birth he reached in and got
[36:12] that baby that we were
[36:13] he tried to turn to pentecost but they
[36:15] wouldn't do it
[36:17] but you and i he has turned us to a new
[36:19] way of thinking
[36:21] to a new thought process even the people
[36:23] in the message
[36:24] they don't even think this is important
[36:26] it's just something to fill in space
[36:28] that's important you won't get a body
[36:31] change without going up that statue of a
[36:33] perfect man you forget it
[36:36] that's right so i said the other sunday
[36:38] this message is
[36:40] not quote why do i have to have a
[36:42] verbatim quote
[36:43] to say that laying on hands is a
[36:47] tradition
[36:50] jesus said it was right he said i found
[36:54] no greater faith in israel than these
[36:55] gentiles
[36:56] who just say speak the word
[37:02] i don't need a quote for a lot of these
[37:03] things folks not verbatim
[37:05] i do not you shouldn't this message has
[37:08] become a bunch of quotes
[37:10] why because there's tradition luther
[37:14] said wesley said pentecost said brother
[37:16] branham said
[37:20] and they're standing today in a
[37:21] methodist and baptist church saying
[37:23] jesus said baptize in the name father
[37:25] son holy ghost and that's exactly what
[37:27] we're going to do because that's what
[37:28] the bible said
[37:30] that's this way brother brown said that
[37:33] come from the pits of hell
[37:35] amen the father son holy ghost
[37:38] whatever revelation you want to call it
[37:40] come from the pits of hell so where is
[37:41] it is it this way or this way
[37:43] it's got to be this way that's why
[37:45] brother branham come to change
[37:47] totally change our thought process
[37:51] totally he said let's go back into the
[37:53] back part of god's mind
[37:56] what about a man that said let's go into
[37:58] god's mind
[37:59] glory i believe he was god's mind
[38:04] talking to me and you
[38:05] not hearsay
[38:08] that's why we got to get away from all
[38:10] the traditions
[38:12] don't misunderstand me we need to have
[38:16] a lot of things but it's not going to
[38:19] get us to a body change it's just not
[38:23] but i couldn't shake his hand he's in a
[38:26] celestial body
[38:27] i could talk to him he just looks like
[38:29] he does there i look like i do so he had
[38:32] all that right see some of the pieces he
[38:33] had right
[38:34] right i'll look like me you'll look like
[38:37] you it doesn't change our features
[38:39] but he's saying they haven't got any of
[38:42] the five senses of t
[38:43] see tasteful smelling here well now
[38:45] that's not true
[38:47] because when he goes across into the
[38:49] into across the curtain of time
[38:51] he talks to them they hear him
[38:55] he talks back to them they he hears them
[38:59] he sees them he fills them
[39:03] now the taste is probably not going to
[39:04] be there or the smell because
[39:06] they're not in their right to be
[39:07] conditioned remember they told him said
[39:09] we
[39:09] we don't eat here they told him that
[39:13] we don't eat here but when we come back
[39:15] oh what a revelation
[39:18] but you would be immortal and you could
[39:19] see one another we'd live in the blessed
[39:22] realms by the altar of god
[39:24] what the sacrifice the altar is what the
[39:26] cross i'll read it to you in just a
[39:27] minute now let's go to the next quote
[39:31] everybody okay haven't had to say uh
[39:36] i can't remember now german chocolate
[39:38] cake
[39:40] now brother brown goes behind the
[39:42] curtain of time he's talking in 1965.
[39:45] it's not a myth it's not an idea let's
[39:46] just read the the red part save time
[39:49] it's not a myth it's not an idea it's
[39:51] not a spirit
[39:52] oh wait a minute it's been a spirit
[40:00] it's not a spirit he just said that okay
[40:03] it's not a spirit it's a man and a woman
[40:06] like
[40:07] you are just exactly
[40:10] then he talks about seeing the region of
[40:12] the lost where hey
[40:13] they were people there too in their
[40:16] theophanies
[40:18] everybody's got a theophany folks every
[40:20] person has one
[40:22] that's who you are that's the person
[40:24] that's your inner being
[40:25] right that's you
[40:29] jesus said don't worry about somebody
[40:30] can kill you body
[40:33] he said worry about the one that can
[40:34] kill your soul right only god can kill a
[40:37] soul
[40:37] even satan can't kill a soul he can kill
[40:39] your body and put you in another
[40:40] dimension
[40:41] but he can't kill even in the fifth
[40:43] dimension where the
[40:44] uh the satan worshipers you would say
[40:47] are in the fifth dimension he can't kill
[40:50] them
[40:52] god kills them god puts them in the lake
[40:55] of fire
[40:56] amen he created them he can take them
[41:00] out
[41:02] then years ago i seen the reasons of the
[41:03] lost
[41:05] there's no way that if i was an artist
[41:07] in other words it was so hideous
[41:09] now let's go in heaven or this place
[41:11] wherever it was i don't know
[41:13] what to call it he referred to it there
[41:15] as souls
[41:16] under the altar remember they were under
[41:20] a place
[41:20] there was some kind of bar withholding
[41:22] them from going on
[41:23] up higher
[41:27] right he said i want to see jesus
[41:31] there was a bar exactly where he said i
[41:34] want to see jesus
[41:35] now brother brown i'm seeing jesus on
[41:37] the earth remember when he was younger
[41:39] and he saw him out in the middle of the
[41:40] field kind of
[41:41] hovering over the the field there but he
[41:44] said i want to see jesus
[41:46] he said well he's a little higher you
[41:47] can't see him now why jesus is already
[41:49] in the glory five body jesus is in the
[41:51] seventh dimension he's sitting up there
[41:53] what
[41:53] that's the altar right that's where he
[41:56] is
[41:57] making a perpetuation for what those
[42:00] under
[42:00] that altar right amen that's why you
[42:03] don't have to have somebody pray for you
[42:05] you believe in
[42:06] god what he's already done brother
[42:08] branham says many times he said
[42:09] if god was standing here with a suit on
[42:11] he couldn't heal you
[42:12] what's he saying believe that it's
[42:16] already done
[42:17] believe in the unseen glory why do we
[42:21] have to have something that we see
[42:22] blessed is more blessed is he that what
[42:25] hadn't seen and believed and those that
[42:26] see
[42:27] and not believe or see and believe
[42:31] there's no way to explain how great it
[42:33] is now you just have to take my word i'm
[42:34] just a man
[42:35] but these visions always come to pass i
[42:38] don't believe he was in a vision i
[42:39] believe he was in that dimension god
[42:41] took him into that took his soul into
[42:43] that dimension but now his body couldn't
[42:44] go
[42:46] it had to stay there right
[42:49] whatever you want to call it he let him
[42:51] go across the curtain of time and see
[42:53] that
[42:53] and he was a young man standing here
[42:55] what a paradox
[42:57] he said i felt up and he's what brother
[42:59] he said
[43:00] i got hair i'm young again but now when
[43:04] he looked back
[43:05] he saw that 52 year old or 50 year old
[43:08] man laying on
[43:08] in the bed he said if i got to go back
[43:12] there
[43:13] yeah he had to go back
[43:16] now i want to take my word i'm just a
[43:18] man he's talking about the visions
[43:19] you say perfect it's beyond that superb
[43:22] it's beyond that sublime there's no word
[43:25] i'm down at the bottom if you'll raise
[43:26] it up please
[43:28] me be afraid to come to this i said do
[43:30] we eat said not
[43:32] not here we don't eat here but when we
[43:34] go back to earth we'll receive a body we
[43:36] can eat in
[43:38] they were telling him that exactly all
[43:41] right
[43:42] well i could feel them so there's you
[43:45] feel
[43:46] see and hear that's three of the things
[43:49] he didn't think you could do in that
[43:50] dimension
[43:51] they just proved him wrong by showing
[43:54] him that vision
[43:55] and remember god showed him the or this
[43:57] translation remember god showed him this
[43:59] before the fifth seal opened
[44:03] that was in 60 seals open in 63
[44:06] see so god showed him and was preparing
[44:09] him
[44:10] to where he could reveal that seal to
[44:12] him showing him that those people
[44:14] were not these people
[44:18] they already had their white robes
[44:20] remember he said there was millions of
[44:21] them just coming over the hill with
[44:23] white robes on them
[44:24] amen well i could feel them they was
[44:27] just like that see and i said well you
[44:30] have oh yes they have a body
[44:31] just not a myth it's a body we know one
[44:35] another they
[44:36] all knowed me were hugging me millions
[44:38] of them i said well i want to see him
[44:39] who brought me here
[44:41] it said you can't see him now you have
[44:43] to wait
[44:44] okay so he he's just like the rest of us
[44:46] he's got to wait
[44:49] to see him in that glorified body when
[44:50] we meet him in the air amen
[44:53] amen why did you put me up here so you
[44:56] were a leader in life do you mean all
[44:58] them's brand rooms he says no
[45:00] that's your converse to christ i looked
[45:02] around
[45:03] and all the hard nights the trials all
[45:05] passed away when i could see their face
[45:07] a young woman ran up one of the most
[45:08] beautiful women she threw her arms
[45:10] around me said precious brother
[45:12] she was a woman but in there there's no
[45:14] sin see our glands are changed there you
[45:16] won't raise children no more there see
[45:17] all the same
[45:18] that sister's the one that the angel
[45:20] turned to him and said don't you
[45:20] remember her
[45:23] well he couldn't remember because the
[45:24] girl lady was 90-something years old
[45:26] and now she was 18.
[45:29] he said no wonder she said my precious
[45:31] brother
[45:33] is that okay right and what he said
[45:36] all right let's keep reading number
[45:37] seven ever present water from the rock
[45:40] 1961.
[45:41] when we die our souls will go under the
[45:43] altar of god where i was privileged to
[45:45] see a few mornings ago
[45:47] in the vision where the bible speaks of
[45:49] our spirits will go to god who give it
[45:50] our bodies shall return to the dust of
[45:52] the earth but someday when the scripture
[45:53] is fulfilled our spirits will be
[45:55] released from god
[45:56] we'll pick up the soul and the soul to
[45:59] the body
[46:00] and the power that'll raise us up is
[46:02] right in us now
[46:04] so see when they go over that other
[46:06] dimension they don't lose anything
[46:08] except their flesh because it was
[46:10] created in this first three dimensions
[46:12] right can't take it in another dimension
[46:14] your human body can't travel
[46:17] without god's help like stephen and some
[46:19] of them i mean not stephen but philip
[46:20] and some of them without god's help it's
[46:22] not a normal thing you know
[46:24] if there wasn't a law to that sons and
[46:27] daughters of god we create them a world
[46:29] out here and go live a private life on
[46:31] it
[46:32] you have the power in you to do it so
[46:34] why am i reading this this quote
[46:36] because you got the power now it's not
[46:38] when it's not when everything breaks and
[46:40] then
[46:40] and it's now now today
[46:44] today you have that power well i can't
[46:46] wait till that seventh seal opens well
[46:48] you know what you got it inside of you
[46:50] already
[46:54] you have the power in you to do it if
[46:56] you've got a shadow of the power of god
[46:58] in you you've got the power to do it
[47:01] god is omnipotent see what i mean the
[47:02] power that's in you will make you could
[47:04] speak a world in existence and go live
[47:06] on it
[47:06] hallelujah there you are
[47:11] all right everybody okay with that
[47:14] i'm not okay i can't find my last page
[47:17] joseph
[47:19] did i don't get my last page hmm
[47:24] i must have destroyed it i threw it away
[47:30] hold on just a minute
[47:33] everybody shake hands and say hallelujah
[47:38] here we go hallelujah hallelujah the
[47:41] seal they got it right there i could
[47:42] have just read it off of that
[47:44] so now let's get into the seal we've got
[47:46] all of this
[47:49] so the church ages are gone you and i
[47:51] are in another dimension and this is
[47:52] gonna happen this is the seal this is
[47:54] the opening of the
[47:56] the seal part we're gonna tear the seal
[47:58] like brother brown already tore it off
[47:59] we're just gonna reiterate what he said
[48:02] all right and see who these people are
[48:04] and when he had opened the fifth seal i
[48:06] saw under the altar the souls of them
[48:07] that were slain for the word of god and
[48:08] for the testimony
[48:09] which they held and they cried with a
[48:11] loud voice
[48:13] saying how long o lord holy and true
[48:15] dost thou not judge and avenge our blood
[48:17] on them that dwell on the earth they're
[48:18] asking them a question
[48:20] and white robes were given unto every
[48:21] one of them and it was said unto them
[48:23] that they should rest yet for a little
[48:25] season
[48:25] until their fellow servants also and
[48:28] their brethren there's two things we've
[48:29] got to deal with here today all right
[48:33] that should be killed as they were
[48:37] should be fulfilled so now let's break
[48:40] this down real quick
[48:42] so now souls under the altar now here's
[48:44] the word i looked up altar
[48:47] and it's a word i can't pronounce so
[48:50] i'm going to try because if you look in
[48:53] webster's dictionary it tells you how to
[48:54] pronounce it
[48:56] when it says in the fifth seal souls
[48:58] under the altar
[48:59] that means metaphorically
[49:03] the cross on which christ suffered an
[49:07] expiatory death e-x-p-i-a-t-o-r-y
[49:12] expiratory death that means one able to
[49:14] make an atonement
[49:17] so we're all under the atonement that
[49:20] christ when he died at calvary he made
[49:22] an atonement
[49:23] right and we all live under that
[49:25] atonement
[49:26] i don't care we all that to me and then
[49:28] see that's that's not that's not an
[49:30] altar
[49:30] right but they're under an atonement
[49:34] of the cross those in the sixth
[49:36] dimension they couldn't see christ
[49:38] but they had to know he they were there
[49:40] for some reason and that he was there
[49:42] too
[49:43] somewhere you can't go over in a sixth
[49:46] dimension and get
[49:47] and have an eternal body and be young
[49:49] and not know that god did something for
[49:51] you
[49:52] they're not over there going well my mom
[49:54] and daddy no
[49:55] no the old things have passed away they
[49:58] know god gave them eternal life they
[50:00] know that they received christ when they
[50:03] were here and
[50:04] now when they passed away they just
[50:06] stepped over into another dimension
[50:08] into something brother brown said
[50:09] sublime can't even take the
[50:11] the word for amen
[50:14] but now these people are not in this
[50:18] dimension
[50:19] talking like the ones in the sixth
[50:21] dimension we just talked about
[50:25] because i'm fixing to tell you what
[50:26] they're saying the bible's already told
[50:27] us what they were saying
[50:29] okay because brother brown said if you
[50:31] in other words if you would have stood
[50:32] back and read that
[50:34] you would have known it wasn't now
[50:36] remember you said well it's
[50:37] uh hindsight's 20 20.
[50:40] when the seal's broke we can see it
[50:42] because we all read it the same way
[50:44] but if we would have just looked judge
[50:46] and avenge our blood brother brown said
[50:48] christians don't do that why in the
[50:51] world would you be in the sixth
[50:52] dimension going well i hope god just
[50:54] that guy that run me off the road and
[50:56] kill me i hope he just killed him no
[51:00] no that's right no
[51:03] they're over there going god if there's
[51:04] any way
[51:06] to save that person and bring him into
[51:10] the place i'm in now
[51:12] please go get him please go get him
[51:16] not not avenge our blood
[51:19] that sounds like with some we do
[51:21] something that's why i look
[51:25] everybody say that word right there
[51:28] temperance
[51:30] why you temper in the sixth dimension
[51:33] they don't have a temper
[51:36] but now in the fifth dimension they
[51:37] probably still do
[51:40] judge and avenge our blood they must
[51:42] know that something they were wrong
[51:44] some way and they're asking god to
[51:47] avenge what happened to them
[51:50] amen not in the sixth dimension remember
[51:53] you got to separate it
[51:54] they're all right with that you got to
[51:56] say this is not the souls under the
[51:57] altar we were just talking about
[51:59] in the sixth dimension they're already
[52:01] gone they there's no sixth dimension
[52:03] except the ones that's already got a
[52:04] glorified body
[52:06] and we're at the marriage supper
[52:08] actually we're waiting in another
[52:10] dimension until god can deal with the
[52:12] jews
[52:14] because who are these people right here
[52:18] they're not gentiles they're
[52:21] jews period
[52:24] they're jews god didn't blind the
[52:28] gentiles the gentiles blinded their
[52:30] south
[52:32] you and i are blind ourself
[52:38] in other words this is the cross on
[52:39] which christ suffered an expiatory or
[52:42] someone able to make an atonement death
[52:46] to appreciate that oneself the fruits of
[52:49] what christ in other words what christ
[52:51] did
[52:51] so what they're doing under in that
[52:53] sixth dimension they appreciated what
[52:54] god done
[52:56] which was the cross so you can put like
[52:58] i said i put the cross here
[53:00] but there's really no altar there's no
[53:03] there's no it says metaphorically
[53:06] metaphorically it doesn't metaphorically
[53:08] it's not the actual thing
[53:10] right it's like an allegory or a what is
[53:13] that
[53:14] a parable okay there is no look and
[53:17] there's no
[53:18] and see here you gotta think with me too
[53:20] there is no bloody jesus christ
[53:24] laying on an altar but brother madam
[53:27] will tell you
[53:28] that the bloody sacrifice is laying on
[53:30] the altar
[53:31] amen but christ is not in another
[53:34] dimension
[53:35] he's got a glorified body he's already
[53:37] seen the disciples and he wasn't
[53:39] all mangled up you know sure he had nail
[53:41] sprints in his hand and the side in his
[53:43] side
[53:44] but he wasn't dealing like a piece of
[53:45] hamburger media like a 20 year old guy
[53:48] right so he has changed but there was a
[53:51] perpetuation made something we can't see
[53:54] that we must believe that christ did
[53:57] that man did one time die on a cross
[54:00] did do what he said gave his soul for my
[54:03] soul
[54:05] remember the bible says he gave his soul
[54:08] a ransom
[54:09] so we could see his seed where did his
[54:11] seed come from not the loins it came
[54:13] from that soul
[54:17] so simple but the souls under the altar
[54:20] here
[54:21] are not gentiles
[54:25] they are jews so keep that in mind these
[54:27] are jew
[54:28] that fifth dimension is a is jewish
[54:31] people
[54:32] in another dimension right everybody all
[54:35] right with that
[54:36] all right and they were there when he
[54:39] had opened the fifth seal i saw under
[54:41] the altar of the souls of them that were
[54:42] slain
[54:43] for the word of god
[54:46] they were slain for the word of god not
[54:49] the word of god in the new testament
[54:53] the word of god of what the old
[54:55] testament said i cannot
[54:57] how can i forget israel he said how can
[54:59] i forget them
[55:00] he said look up count the stars
[55:03] look down count the sand of the sea of
[55:06] the sands on the on the beach in other
[55:07] words
[55:09] i can't forget israel now they lost
[55:12] their position
[55:14] hello come on people they lost their
[55:16] position
[55:18] they were the bride of christ first
[55:20] right
[55:22] but when they went and
[55:25] not only got a hoarse forehead they
[55:27] played the
[55:28] they played the harlot what they went to
[55:31] baal they went to
[55:32] maylock and who are all those other ones
[55:35] that they went toward
[55:36] set up the golden calf what they horde
[55:39] against god
[55:40] so once they did you can't take your
[55:43] wife back once she's been defiled
[55:45] hello you can't so christ can't take
[55:49] israel back his bride but he's not going
[55:52] to forget him because they had a
[55:53] position at one time
[55:56] so he can't forget him
[56:02] but they never were intimate with him
[56:04] you and i as gentiles
[56:06] were intimate with this man called jesus
[56:10] depart from me i never knew you and
[56:11] never had an intimate relationship with
[56:13] you
[56:14] that's the jews they never had an
[56:15] intimate what they they said let his
[56:17] blood be on us and our children
[56:19] they kicked him completely out called
[56:21] him belgiub
[56:23] but look they were slain for the word of
[56:27] god so what
[56:27] they were slain because of one thing
[56:30] they were a jew
[56:33] not they were good not they were bad not
[56:36] they were
[56:37] went to synagogue or didn't go to the
[56:38] synagogue they were slain but
[56:41] because they were jews
[56:44] okay or israel whatever you want to say
[56:49] people say well jews say the word but
[56:51] whatever
[56:52] god's chosen people the children of
[56:56] israel
[56:58] okay the children of israel is the 12
[57:00] tribes
[57:01] and that's israel so let's leave it
[57:04] alone
[57:06] so they were slain for the word of god
[57:09] what they were slain because they said
[57:11] we're jews
[57:12] we're looking for the messiah we don't
[57:14] believe he's come yet
[57:16] we're looking for the messiah this is
[57:18] the way he's supposed to come
[57:20] and we're still looking for him the
[57:23] orthodox jew is still over there looking
[57:25] for him right now today
[57:27] for 2 000 years later they're still
[57:29] looking for him
[57:32] so these people were slain so in other
[57:34] words they were killed so these are
[57:35] souls
[57:37] under the altar they have went into
[57:39] another dimension right
[57:41] they were slain for the word of god and
[57:42] the testimony they held what was their
[57:44] testimony
[57:45] we're the people of god you remember
[57:46] rabbi richmond wasn't rabbi richmond got
[57:48] up at brother bishops and he said look
[57:50] people
[57:50] he said i'm a jew and he said i can't
[57:53] help it
[57:56] amen i'm a jew and i can't help but i
[57:58] was born a jew and i was born
[58:00] in israel and i'm under god's covenant
[58:03] for the jews
[58:04] and he's right he said i can't forget
[58:07] them
[58:08] god said i can't forget them that you're
[58:10] going to lose your position but i'm not
[58:12] going to ever forget you
[58:17] so they were slain for the testimony
[58:19] they held now we'll talk about this the
[58:20] next sunday a little bit
[58:22] but remember
[58:25] once they get into work let's look in
[58:27] our modern time with eichmann and hitler
[58:28] where six million jews were killed well
[58:30] that's part of that
[58:31] right that exactly right because the
[58:34] testimony they had was
[58:36] we're a jew hitler says okay you're a
[58:38] jew you're dead
[58:40] right you're jews you're gone six
[58:42] million of you we're gonna gash you
[58:44] shoot you do everything else
[58:47] so why are they saying that because you
[58:50] know what they were violently killed
[58:52] for no reason not they were murderers
[58:55] and you understand the laundry list
[58:57] they were just killed because they lived
[59:00] in a town called israel or jerusalem
[59:02] or they lived somewhere else and said
[59:04] we're jews
[59:06] you're dead hitler had no other reason
[59:09] to kill him
[59:10] except he was wanting to exterminate the
[59:12] jewish race
[59:14] so how long lord they cried with a loud
[59:17] voice saying how long oh lord true and
[59:19] holy and true
[59:22] so they know they're in a place and
[59:24] they're talking to god
[59:26] right they cried with a loud voice how
[59:30] long
[59:30] oh lord holy and true
[59:34] dost thou not judge and avenge our blood
[59:37] on them that dwell on the earth
[59:39] they were killed on this earth
[59:44] and they're asking why
[59:50] when are you going to judge them and
[59:51] avenge our blood because you i see
[59:54] here's the way i see it lord
[59:57] you've put us in this place we're not we
[1:00:01] we're not anywhere else we're not
[1:00:02] mingled with the nations
[1:00:05] we're in this special place and i look
[1:00:06] over here and see some of my jew friends
[1:00:08] and i see this
[1:00:09] i see this i see all of jews right these
[1:00:11] are all jews
[1:00:13] what do you we were killed for no
[1:00:16] apparent reason except we were jews
[1:00:19] in other words what are you going to do
[1:00:21] about it that's pretty strong but you
[1:00:23] know what jews were that way
[1:00:25] brother the brother they'll go over
[1:00:26] there see how they're they're pretty
[1:00:28] belligerent people
[1:00:29] yeah pretty much
[1:00:33] so then what happens and white robes
[1:00:35] were given unto
[1:00:37] every one of them exactly
[1:00:40] and it was said unto them that they
[1:00:42] should rest
[1:00:45] in other words they're not being
[1:00:46] tormented here they're resting
[1:00:48] right so they're not in the fifth
[1:00:49] dimension they're in a dimension inside
[1:00:52] of a dimension
[1:00:53] no way i can see it hey look brother
[1:00:56] brother didn't see paul irenaeus and
[1:00:57] barton or none of them
[1:00:58] right he just saw his people right
[1:01:00] exactly right so there must be
[1:01:02] dimensions inside of dimensions if you
[1:01:03] never thought about that you need to
[1:01:04] start thinking about it
[1:01:06] in the sixth dimension there should be
[1:01:08] probably seven dimensions
[1:01:10] inside of that dimension you say how
[1:01:11] brother branham if he would have seen
[1:01:13] paul he'd have noted he made it
[1:01:15] brother brown said did paul make it he
[1:01:18] asked the angel did paul make it well
[1:01:19] now if i was sitting here looking at
[1:01:20] mark
[1:01:21] and we were on the other side and i said
[1:01:23] did mark make it no he's standing right
[1:01:24] here
[1:01:26] so paul was gathered with his people
[1:01:30] the messenger to ephesus brother dale's
[1:01:32] been covering it that latter rain is
[1:01:34] what it's a harvest
[1:01:35] right there was a harvest of paul's
[1:01:38] message
[1:01:39] in the people that harvested them into a
[1:01:42] dimension
[1:01:44] arenas
[1:01:47] sowed then when those people passed away
[1:01:51] they passed away under ireneus's message
[1:01:54] god harvested them and put them a
[1:01:55] dimension inside of a dimension
[1:01:58] that's all i can see so these people are
[1:02:00] in a dimension inside a dimension
[1:02:02] somewhere
[1:02:02] they're not in trouble because he says
[1:02:06] they should rest yet for a little season
[1:02:08] now what does that season cover
[1:02:10] 2 000 years
[1:02:13] because this fifth seal jew is from what
[1:02:15] christ at calvary
[1:02:17] till they go in until we go in the
[1:02:19] rapture then god starts dealing with
[1:02:21] them and then 144 thousands got to be
[1:02:23] killed
[1:02:23] all right so he's going to deal with
[1:02:25] them for a little season
[1:02:27] that they should rest yet for a little
[1:02:29] season
[1:02:30] until their fellow servants
[1:02:33] in other words people just like them not
[1:02:35] gentiles jews
[1:02:38] and their brethren oh there must be some
[1:02:42] brethren coming in here
[1:02:45] should be killed as they were now watch
[1:02:55] 144 thousand liver rather
[1:03:01] 000 of their brethren now their
[1:03:02] brethren's not going into this dimension
[1:03:05] they're going to get their robes here
[1:03:06] but it says you got to wait
[1:03:08] until they're killed
[1:03:13] until their fellow servants also and
[1:03:15] their brethren
[1:03:16] that should be killed as they were
[1:03:20] should be fulfilled so they're waiting
[1:03:23] on that 144 thousand
[1:03:25] to pass away or to be killed as they
[1:03:28] were
[1:03:29] because what i'll promise you according
[1:03:32] to the word of god
[1:03:33] every one of them 144 000 if you've got
[1:03:36] any question who they are they're all
[1:03:37] jews
[1:03:39] tribes of israel right lineages right
[1:03:43] lineages they can go back trace their
[1:03:45] lineage
[1:03:46] that's 144 000 but they're going to be
[1:03:49] given white robes here
[1:03:51] so they're not souls under the altar but
[1:03:53] they're crying how long
[1:03:55] until all this happens is everybody okay
[1:03:58] with that
[1:04:01] so their souls under the altar
[1:04:04] crying how long how long to avenge our
[1:04:08] blood
[1:04:09] that's not christians that's people that
[1:04:12] god
[1:04:13] literally blinded their eyes
[1:04:17] so that you and i could come in
[1:04:20] that may be hard for you to believe but
[1:04:21] you know what he's god and he can do
[1:04:23] what he wants to do know what
[1:04:27] we'll read it next sunday they cried for
[1:04:30] his blood be on us and our children
[1:04:34] and brother brown said god saved them
[1:04:36] anyway right glory
[1:04:40] but he put his hands over their eyes
[1:04:43] withheld them from seeing the revelation
[1:04:46] of who jesus christ was
[1:04:48] until they get into this dimension and
[1:04:51] what happens they said
[1:04:52] oh lord oh lord how long
[1:04:56] in other words they're taught they know
[1:04:58] they were put there because of something
[1:04:59] that happened and that god's the one
[1:05:00] that put them there
[1:05:02] so they know if god put them there we're
[1:05:05] okay
[1:05:06] and then that same god says rest for a
[1:05:09] little while
[1:05:10] in other words sit back you have been
[1:05:12] tortured for 2
[1:05:14] 000 years in that first three dimensions
[1:05:17] they have killed you just because you
[1:05:19] were a jew just because you said you
[1:05:21] were a jew
[1:05:22] man has killed you but now rest for a
[1:05:25] little while until your fellow servants
[1:05:26] and your brethren
[1:05:27] have to go through the kind of the same
[1:05:29] thing you did and they're going to get
[1:05:31] their robes on
[1:05:32] their side but we're going to all be
[1:05:34] together because that fifth seal jew is
[1:05:35] going to be right there somewhere with
[1:05:37] us
[1:05:38] that's right they're not going to hell
[1:05:39] so they're going to be right there
[1:05:40] somewhere mingling
[1:05:42] you know they're not ever going to live
[1:05:43] inside the city
[1:05:46] but they sure can populate the outside
[1:05:47] of the city
[1:05:49] and this great thing we call earth where
[1:05:50] we're going to
[1:05:52] that future home but they can go in and
[1:05:54] out but they can't stay
[1:05:55] because what god
[1:05:59] has got one word that you and i can't
[1:06:03] understand it's
[1:06:04] called grace
[1:06:08] try to write grace down and tell me what
[1:06:10] it is
[1:06:12] well it's because you're lost right
[1:06:14] there it's because i
[1:06:18] if you put because i you better stop
[1:06:20] right there
[1:06:21] right because grace is what unmerited
[1:06:25] favor there's no one little
[1:06:28] bitty dot of a thing you could do if if
[1:06:32] there was one dot you couldn't call it
[1:06:34] grace right
[1:06:36] that's what's going to change your body
[1:06:39] when we come to a fifth seal grace that
[1:06:41] shows that god is so graceful that he's
[1:06:43] gonna take this thing right here
[1:06:47] that we that we drive by all these
[1:06:50] cemeteries and we see i drive by one the
[1:06:52] other day drove by one the other day
[1:06:54] over at lebanon campground i thought god
[1:06:56] there's souls in another dimension
[1:06:58] somewhere but their bodies laying
[1:07:00] underneath that tombstone
[1:07:02] one day if they're born again that that
[1:07:05] ain't gonna be in there
[1:07:07] and they ain't gonna have to dig their
[1:07:09] way out
[1:07:11] they you're not gonna see a hand coming
[1:07:12] up luis
[1:07:14] you're not going to see a hand coming up
[1:07:16] out of the grave
[1:07:17] no they're going to come and get that
[1:07:18] glorified body and just as jesus walked
[1:07:20] through the wall to see the disciples
[1:07:22] they're just going to stand up
[1:07:25] and they're going to go man this feels
[1:07:27] good
[1:07:29] i'm back i got a human body
[1:07:34] i'm hungry brother larry i'm hungry
[1:07:38] give me something deep hey man
[1:07:42] but that's us that's not these people
[1:07:45] these people have to stay there for a
[1:07:46] little while longer
[1:07:48] they're not like you and me but you know
[1:07:49] what they have a special one little
[1:07:51] special group
[1:07:53] just to show grace god's got them people
[1:07:56] in a place then it's nothing but grave
[1:08:00] glory there's no way then people should
[1:08:02] ever be given eternal life
[1:08:06] you can't write it down you can't write
[1:08:10] down and say well they did that
[1:08:11] no it's all contrary just like i said
[1:08:14] listen
[1:08:15] that's what we think is this way kill
[1:08:17] them all lord
[1:08:20] you know you whatever what is that
[1:08:21] saying kill them and let god separate
[1:08:23] them
[1:08:24] now kill them all lord no no
[1:08:28] then people right there are going to be
[1:08:31] shouting
[1:08:33] as loud as you
[1:08:36] because that group of people got grace
[1:08:40] on this earth because this is where it
[1:08:44] started
[1:08:45] he give grace on this earth and grace
[1:08:47] put them in a place to hold them
[1:08:49] until we come to the fullness of grace
[1:08:53] because to me the fullness of grace is
[1:08:54] that capstone right there
[1:08:58] jesus christ come to bring grace amen
[1:09:01] there's grace grace the headstone is
[1:09:04] coming carrying white
[1:09:06] grace grace amazing grace
[1:09:11] amazing grace how sweet to sound right
[1:09:17] everybody all right with that so there's
[1:09:19] your fifth seal
[1:09:20] that's the seal part open
[1:09:25] so we must change our thought process
[1:09:28] and i know we have because you know what
[1:09:30] if you read the fifth seal you're going
[1:09:31] to read what brother erm said about this
[1:09:32] fifth sealed jew
[1:09:33] it was jewish people but realize one
[1:09:35] thing
[1:09:38] the different the only difference
[1:09:40] between them and us is we get ours here
[1:09:44] they're giving robes when they're
[1:09:45] already passed on
[1:09:47] don't you ever think you can do that
[1:09:50] because we come under a different
[1:09:51] uh i don't say a rule but we come under
[1:09:53] a different word
[1:09:54] right because that word in that fifth
[1:09:57] seal when it when god wrote it in the
[1:09:58] bible he wrote it for them people right
[1:10:00] there
[1:10:00] but he wrote an underlying meaning for
[1:10:02] us to get and that's what we'll get next
[1:10:04] sunday is everybody all right
[1:10:07] not next sunday maybe the next let me
[1:10:10] read you a little something right here
[1:10:11] before we get before we leave
[1:10:17] listen to this now i want to tell you
[1:10:19] this is this is an example of what kind
[1:10:21] of what i went through
[1:10:22] not comparing myself to the prophet but
[1:10:24] watch this
[1:10:25] brother branham on 11 12
[1:10:31] on 11 12 of 1961
[1:10:36] he preached a true sign that's
[1:10:39] overlooked
[1:10:42] women i'm talking about pentecostals
[1:10:44] this is paragraph 194.
[1:10:46] go up to the altar they begin pleading
[1:10:49] i've always been against an altar call
[1:10:52] i'm reading it verbatim might as well
[1:10:55] say it
[1:10:55] i don't believe in them there's no such
[1:10:59] a thing in the bible
[1:11:01] how can any man come lest god calls him
[1:11:04] you couldn't keep him away you don't
[1:11:06] have to call anything if god's calling
[1:11:09] him
[1:11:10] altar calls are a methodist idea
[1:11:14] that's right altar call they get a hold
[1:11:16] of them say john you know your mother
[1:11:17] died a long time ago oh boo hoo
[1:11:20] yes brother boo hoo that's not
[1:11:22] conversion
[1:11:23] right now cut it off now the next
[1:11:26] service
[1:11:27] which was 11 19 1961 which was
[1:11:32] seven days later from one sunday to the
[1:11:34] next watch what he said
[1:11:36] perfect perfect strength by perfect
[1:11:38] weakness
[1:11:40] i don't say this to be indifferent but
[1:11:41] sometimes under anointing
[1:11:44] now listen to what he said he said this
[1:11:46] under the anointing one week ago
[1:11:49] that he did not believe in altar calls
[1:11:53] see we're all now we're all of our
[1:11:54] brains are going to don't be nervous
[1:11:56] listen
[1:11:57] but sometimes under anointing you know
[1:11:59] things that you wouldn't you wouldn't
[1:12:01] darest
[1:12:02] tell the people you know what he's
[1:12:04] saying he said i thought this all along
[1:12:06] i just haven't never spoke it then
[1:12:10] sometimes
[1:12:10] under anointing something will slip out
[1:12:16] you see and you won't notice it and one
[1:12:20] of the things that i believe was said
[1:12:22] last sunday that might cause someone
[1:12:24] when i mentioned that i never
[1:12:26] did believe in altar calls
[1:12:29] i want to say that and clear that so
[1:12:32] you'll understand
[1:12:33] there never was an altar call made in
[1:12:36] all the bible
[1:12:38] there's no such a thing in the scripture
[1:12:41] nowhere down through the ages was it
[1:12:44] made until the methodist age about 200
[1:12:47] years ago tradition
[1:12:52] if we're supposed to get back to the
[1:12:53] faith of the fathers
[1:12:56] they never made an altar call they never
[1:12:58] had a prayer line
[1:13:00] hello altar calls are when people come
[1:13:04] up and try to persuade and pull people
[1:13:06] come on john
[1:13:07] that's the reason this church listen to
[1:13:10] this
[1:13:11] that's the reason the church is all
[1:13:13] muddled up the way it is today is
[1:13:15] because
[1:13:16] of such things
[1:13:19] conviction you don't have to say a thing
[1:13:21] brother god's there and done done the
[1:13:23] work
[1:13:24] while peter spake these words the holy
[1:13:25] ghost fell on them that heard the word
[1:13:27] there's no altar call no such a thing
[1:13:31] no the altar is a place of prayer where
[1:13:34] every person coming to the church now
[1:13:35] i've seen this in several churches
[1:13:37] where they'll come people come through
[1:13:38] the door and instead before they pray
[1:13:40] they'll come down and kneel and pray
[1:13:42] then go to their seat now that's he said
[1:13:44] that's okay every person coming to the
[1:13:45] church
[1:13:46] should first go in kneel at the altar
[1:13:48] simply pray to god and offer their
[1:13:50] petition of prayer
[1:13:51] for their loved ones and thank god for
[1:13:53] what he has done for them
[1:13:54] then go back to the seat and then the
[1:13:57] church
[1:13:58] is the place where the word of god
[1:14:01] judgment begins at the house of god
[1:14:03] where the judgment
[1:14:04] of the word goes forth then but today
[1:14:08] we've changed that around so much
[1:14:13] we've changed that around so much
[1:14:16] now i have nothing again in this
[1:14:19] southern language
[1:14:20] i have nothing again anyone making altar
[1:14:22] calls see
[1:14:23] i've made a many of them and i'll
[1:14:25] probably make many more if i keep on
[1:14:27] going
[1:14:29] but just for my own self see you you
[1:14:31] collect
[1:14:32] too much and there's nothing against it
[1:14:35] no harm it's all right
[1:14:36] because listen jesus said no man can
[1:14:37] come to me except the father draws him
[1:14:39] first
[1:14:41] that's right that throws your altar call
[1:14:43] completely out
[1:14:45] all together our responsibility is to
[1:14:49] preach the word
[1:14:50] the bible said as many as believe was
[1:14:52] baptized repent and be baptized in the
[1:14:54] name of jesus christ for their mission
[1:14:56] their forgiveness of sins
[1:14:57] what be baptized in the name of jesus
[1:14:59] christ for the mention of your sins and
[1:15:00] you shall receive
[1:15:01] the gift of the holy ghost right
[1:15:06] that okay but when you persuade and pull
[1:15:09] and scare people and talk
[1:15:11] people people must come sanely soberly
[1:15:14] under conviction
[1:15:15] and receive christ then the first thing
[1:15:18] they do as soon as they receive christ
[1:15:20] setting in their seats the next thing
[1:15:24] is be baptized in the name of jesus
[1:15:25] christ for the mission and sin that they
[1:15:26] have been convicted that they're wrong
[1:15:29] that's how they're remitted their sins
[1:15:32] because they have repented been baptized
[1:15:34] as a moral to the people i have received
[1:15:36] christ as my personal savior then you're
[1:15:37] a candidate for the holy ghost
[1:15:38] but now many people continue on
[1:15:40] persuading and calling to the altar and
[1:15:42] so forth
[1:15:43] which that's all right i'll go with that
[1:15:45] that's perfectly all right as far as i'm
[1:15:46] concerned
[1:15:47] anybody that wants to do it but to me
[1:15:49] it's not scriptural
[1:15:51] and i would like to stay with the
[1:15:54] scripture
[1:15:57] i'm just telling you what he said he
[1:15:59] said i don't believe in him and then he
[1:16:00] come back
[1:16:01] seven days later and he said they all
[1:16:02] said i said this but this is i want to
[1:16:04] explain it so that's the same way with
[1:16:07] with explaining what's going on with
[1:16:09] altar calls and things
[1:16:11] it was never in the early church
[1:16:14] it's a tradition that we've got used to
[1:16:20] and brother brown said that's all right
[1:16:22] but it's not
[1:16:23] scriptural it's a tradition
[1:16:27] i'm just telling you that i
[1:16:32] alters there never was an
[1:16:35] altar call made at any time in the bible
[1:16:37] there's no such a thing that's in
[1:16:39] paradox 1961.
[1:16:43] they didn't do it in the bible that's a
[1:16:44] tradition of our people originated
[1:16:46] formerly by the methodists
[1:16:48] but it's a good thing but i don't like a
[1:16:50] dried repentance either he said and
[1:16:52] faith is the substance 1951.
[1:16:56] so you see not meaning that you
[1:16:59] shouldn't make an altar call
[1:17:00] you shouldn't depend on them
[1:17:04] i've got to go to x church because they
[1:17:06] have altar calls
[1:17:09] really week week
[1:17:12] week faith right amen
[1:17:16] week week week faith now let me explain
[1:17:19] something else too
[1:17:21] somebody asked about a quote and i gave
[1:17:23] him one where brother brown says you
[1:17:24] come up to my prayer line in other words
[1:17:26] i'm going to paraphrase you come up my
[1:17:27] prayer line you don't get healed then
[1:17:30] you go to oral roberts prayer line you
[1:17:31] don't get healed you go to billy
[1:17:32] graham's prayer line you don't get
[1:17:34] healed he said that weakens your faith
[1:17:35] every time you go through there
[1:17:38] now let me make something clear if you
[1:17:40] need a prayer you come up here and be
[1:17:41] prayed for don't ever stop
[1:17:45] and we'll pray as earnest as we'll ever
[1:17:47] pray because it's life and death people
[1:17:49] it's life and death we are
[1:17:50] we are still human beings i don't care
[1:17:52] who it is
[1:17:54] but don't come back up here two weeks
[1:17:56] later for the same thing
[1:17:59] that weakens your faith i got joe's got
[1:18:02] the quote back there because i gave it
[1:18:03] to him
[1:18:03] last week that weakens your faith coming
[1:18:06] up for the same thing over and over
[1:18:08] again why
[1:18:08] you know what you're waiting on some
[1:18:10] light switch to come on you're waiting
[1:18:12] on some
[1:18:13] uh you know jerk or you wait you see
[1:18:15] what you're depending on
[1:18:17] satan can what impersonate every one of
[1:18:20] them
[1:18:21] but he cannot impersonate god calling
[1:18:24] you
[1:18:24] in your seat and you receive it in your
[1:18:28] altar of your heart
[1:18:30] and then it changed your life that was
[1:18:33] my whole thing i've seen people come to
[1:18:35] the altar cry scream snot and pray
[1:18:37] and they're out in the world now what
[1:18:40] did it do any good
[1:18:45] we're looking at what we're looking at a
[1:18:47] body change we're looking at where god
[1:18:49] is not going to speak through 50 000 000
[1:18:52] people he's going to speak through you
[1:18:56] if your glorified body is inside of you
[1:18:59] then who's gonna bring it out
[1:19:03] i just read you in there you had enough
[1:19:05] you had enough power in your own
[1:19:07] body right now not over yonder that'd be
[1:19:10] real easy over there
[1:19:11] but right now brother brown said you got
[1:19:13] enough power in your body by the baptism
[1:19:15] of the holy ghost to you to create a
[1:19:16] world
[1:19:17] and go live on it put your hell by a bar
[1:19:21] what's the bar
[1:19:22] first three dimensions you know what
[1:19:24] your first bar is i can't
[1:19:27] that's the biggest bar i can't
[1:19:30] you know why cause you know what i
[1:19:32] didn't when i went to the grand canyon i
[1:19:33] didn't go over that rail
[1:19:35] i didn't say oh i can fly just like that
[1:19:38] well you'd have
[1:19:39] you'd have found me down there a little
[1:19:40] speck about that big
[1:19:42] but you know what if god ever told you
[1:19:45] you can walk right across that thing but
[1:19:51] you better know that it's god that told
[1:19:52] you
[1:19:56] that's why i want to say one more thing
[1:19:59] god
[1:20:00] works with individuals
[1:20:04] differently because we're gentiles
[1:20:09] if we need prayer please come be prayed
[1:20:12] for
[1:20:13] but just don't come up for the same
[1:20:14] thing every other sunday
[1:20:17] i got this problem i got this problem
[1:20:19] well you know what you either like it
[1:20:21] you know what brother brown said about
[1:20:22] that girl right and he didn't know what
[1:20:24] he said about that maniac
[1:20:26] they said brother brown did he get rid
[1:20:27] of that no he didn't get rid of it he
[1:20:28] said remember he said he said he liked
[1:20:30] it
[1:20:31] there's a lot of people like to be sick
[1:20:33] you know i got a sister-in-law that if
[1:20:34] she was totally healed she'd probably
[1:20:36] well i'm gonna say what she'd do they
[1:20:38] got to be sick to have some kind of
[1:20:40] something in life you know some old woe
[1:20:43] is me moment
[1:20:44] that ain't that we shouldn't be that way
[1:20:46] as christians we should be leaving our
[1:20:48] seat
[1:20:50] we should just like i said we should
[1:20:52] pray before we walk through that door
[1:20:55] expecting that god's gonna gonna reveal
[1:20:57] the word to you
[1:20:59] now revealing the word to you
[1:21:03] really revealing the word to you going
[1:21:05] from right here to here
[1:21:07] there's where the altar is you have went
[1:21:09] to the altar
[1:21:12] amen you have went to the altar that god
[1:21:15] wants to talk to you at
[1:21:17] sure he may talk listen i come right
[1:21:19] here
[1:21:21] december 17th 1997 i came right here and
[1:21:24] stood right in this spot
[1:21:26] and asked god to come into my life i
[1:21:29] needed that
[1:21:31] i was a young christian i don't care how
[1:21:34] old i was
[1:21:35] i was a young christian and i needed
[1:21:37] that right
[1:21:39] but now what would it be now after this
[1:21:42] many years
[1:21:44] 20 years 21 or so
[1:21:47] then i walk back up here and do the same
[1:21:49] thing
[1:21:53] that ain't even mental i mean that's not
[1:21:56] you see what i'm saying
[1:21:58] if you need prayer for something come
[1:21:59] and ask prayer me and june stood
[1:22:02] several years ago for our children when
[1:22:04] brother
[1:22:06] forney was standing right here and he
[1:22:07] said anybody that wants to come up for
[1:22:09] their children
[1:22:10] but you know what we don't come up every
[1:22:13] sunday and ask for that
[1:22:15] that night it was settled for me and her
[1:22:17] regardless of the circumstance
[1:22:20] and we didn't come up here to write a
[1:22:21] list i want my children saved and filled
[1:22:24] with the holy ghost
[1:22:25] that's it i can't save them you can't
[1:22:28] save them
[1:22:29] but you can try your best to get them
[1:22:31] away till they can be saved
[1:22:34] in other words pray for them
[1:22:37] claim them now what's claiming brother
[1:22:39] donnie claiming is they're yours
[1:22:43] not they're going to be yours they're
[1:22:45] yours
[1:22:46] your kid didn't become your kid when he
[1:22:49] turned 40 and 30 and
[1:22:50] no he was born your kid
[1:22:54] so he's your kid and whatever happens
[1:22:56] that's what i said by circumstances
[1:22:57] we come up here and we try to get rid of
[1:23:00] something
[1:23:01] and then it's like and i got a quote
[1:23:02] here i'm not going to read it because
[1:23:03] we're go
[1:23:04] musicians come because what happens is
[1:23:07] you turn around and you go back to your
[1:23:09] seat and you're still going
[1:23:13] leave it up there and don't worry about
[1:23:17] it no more
[1:23:18] don't come back up here the next sunday
[1:23:19] like this
[1:23:21] that makes you weaker because you gotta
[1:23:23] you're depending on
[1:23:24] something some light to come on some
[1:23:27] switch
[1:23:28] some angelic music to begin playing you
[1:23:31] understand what i'm saying
[1:23:32] you're waiting on something external
[1:23:35] when god said
[1:23:36] if i'm standing beside you son i can't
[1:23:37] heal you
[1:23:39] if i was standing right here today i
[1:23:41] can't heal you i did it at calvary
[1:23:43] believe that
[1:23:47] believe that right
[1:23:52] through all we do don't ever forget what
[1:23:55] happened to calvary
[1:23:58] because that's when the sin debt was
[1:23:59] paid that's when your body got
[1:24:02] healed that's when your glorified body
[1:24:03] come into being right
[1:24:06] so let's just believe that it's already
[1:24:07] done
[1:24:09] believe it's finished listen if
[1:24:12] abraham we're supposed to be abraham's
[1:24:15] children right
[1:24:16] right now abraham didn't stop every 15
[1:24:19] minutes or even every 15 years
[1:24:21] and go all right god no he just kept on
[1:24:24] walking
[1:24:26] whatever happened over here to lot that
[1:24:27] was lot's business
[1:24:29] whatever happened to that remember he
[1:24:30] comes up to lot and he says look we got
[1:24:32] to separate
[1:24:33] in other words we've been going have you
[1:24:36] ever done this before
[1:24:37] we we've been going this way together a
[1:24:39] lot for a long time
[1:24:43] right he said lot you pick your way
[1:24:47] and i'll go the other way lord says i
[1:24:49] like this way because this is the way we
[1:24:50] go
[1:24:51] abraham said okay i'll take that way and
[1:24:54] you know what
[1:24:55] then god told him said abraham wherever
[1:24:57] the souls are your feet
[1:25:00] wherever the souls are your feet not
[1:25:02] what wherever the souls are your feet
[1:25:05] turn and walk and wherever you walk i'll
[1:25:09] give you that land
[1:25:10] what a great thing that god through a
[1:25:12] prophet told us
[1:25:13] that the very place that that abraham
[1:25:16] took communion with melchizedek
[1:25:18] is where the new city's going to push up
[1:25:20] amen
[1:25:22] abraham was looking for a city brother
[1:25:24] john it was under his
[1:25:26] feet he just couldn't see it
[1:25:30] but by faith he believed it what a great
[1:25:33] thing to know that that rock
[1:25:35] that rock that's going to build that new
[1:25:37] city
[1:25:38] was right there where abraham and and
[1:25:40] melchizedek were
[1:25:41] conversing with each other if they would
[1:25:44] have been if they would have had sonar
[1:25:45] they could have looked down and abraham
[1:25:47] said that's a big old pyramid looking
[1:25:50] rock down in that
[1:25:52] right brother brown said the very spot
[1:25:56] that he met melchizedek is where our new
[1:25:59] city
[1:26:01] is going to push up so it must start
[1:26:05] with you meeting melchizedek
[1:26:09] god in human flesh
[1:26:12] god in human flesh god in human flesh
[1:26:15] god in human flesh god in human flesh
[1:26:18] god in human flesh
[1:26:19] god in human flesh that's where you meet
[1:26:22] him
[1:26:24] let's stand
[1:26:28] so don't misunderstand me
[1:26:33] but i want you to not misunderstand me
[1:26:35] on this this has got us nothing
[1:26:38] but just a good life good christian walk
[1:26:42] sure we can commune with god but if we
[1:26:44] keep going in this direction right here
[1:26:46] we're going to get the same results
[1:26:49] got to turn and change our thinking
[1:26:54] to where god i believe what you said i
[1:26:57] don't need somebody to lay hands on me
[1:27:02] that's faith in you because remember
[1:27:06] god's going to deal with israel as a
[1:27:07] nation so what one gets the other one
[1:27:10] gets
[1:27:11] not gentiles not gentiles
[1:27:15] we're saved as individuals so we're
[1:27:17] sitting just like this we're like this
[1:27:18] we're up
[1:27:19] here down some here some are brand new
[1:27:22] some needs it
[1:27:24] brother ryan we were talking the other
[1:27:25] day you were talking about your children
[1:27:28] see you teach your children but lay your
[1:27:29] hands on the children
[1:27:31] but i'm going to tell you something
[1:27:35] let me give you a little secret that
[1:27:36] goes on this place all the time
[1:27:38] you'll actually say something that i've
[1:27:40] got a headache or i've got a cold i've
[1:27:42] got a backache
[1:27:43] how many times you've seen brother dale
[1:27:45] do this
[1:27:48] and just turn and never say a word and
[1:27:51] walk off
[1:27:52] what has he done he just touched your
[1:27:55] body
[1:27:57] and was praying for you
[1:28:00] i don't i don't lay my hands on june and
[1:28:03] have some great emotion
[1:28:05] she's sick what do we do we hug
[1:28:09] we hold each other up in my mind i'm
[1:28:11] saying god
[1:28:13] take this thing away from her glory you
[1:28:16] don't have to have
[1:28:16] all that right just if you want contact
[1:28:21] if you want contact i'll promise you you
[1:28:23] ever shake that man's hand
[1:28:26] and hug his neck he's prayed for you
[1:28:29] right amen he's prayed for you at that
[1:28:32] moment
[1:28:32] so whatever needs you got if your wife
[1:28:36] sit your kid's sick if your kid's sick
[1:28:37] you lay hands on that child because they
[1:28:39] believe
[1:28:40] that you can touch god
[1:28:46] so don't worry about that you lay hands
[1:28:47] on them amen
[1:28:50] i'm not talking about anything like that
[1:28:52] but when we grow into maturity though we
[1:28:54] should not need the same thing as we
[1:28:55] need as children
[1:28:57] we should know it should not become a
[1:28:59] knowledge it should become our person
[1:29:02] right that jesus christ is in you
[1:29:05] and has already healed you can't
[1:29:09] he can't double heal you he's already
[1:29:11] healed you
[1:29:12] you just gotta accept that glory i
[1:29:15] wasn't gonna be this long today but lord
[1:29:16] bless you i'm sorry
[1:29:18] but you take it by faith
[1:29:21] faith is the substance of things hoped
[1:29:24] for
[1:29:25] the evidence of things not what
[1:29:29] seen because if you see it you don't
[1:29:32] need faith
[1:29:35] but if you don't get an instant healing
[1:29:38] walk
[1:29:38] abraham continue to walk
[1:29:43] and i'll promise you if we do that god
[1:29:46] will meet you because he kept meeting
[1:29:48] abraham and all the whole path he just
[1:29:50] kept meeting abraham
[1:29:51] he was right there with him walking with
[1:29:53] him and when abraham needed something he
[1:29:55] was right there
[1:29:56] you're never alone right i was thinking
[1:29:59] the other day brother joe you know
[1:30:01] you know driving down the road and you
[1:30:02] don't even think you know i'm delivering
[1:30:04] mail
[1:30:04] then all of a sudden you have this
[1:30:08] pause moment and you go
[1:30:12] thank you lord just for a split second
[1:30:15] you showed me you were there now did i
[1:30:17] see god know did i see a pillow fire no
[1:30:19] did i see no
[1:30:22] he's here right he's not out here
[1:30:25] he's inside of you that's what we got
[1:30:29] what
[1:30:29] brother brown preached the message
[1:30:31] looking to the unseen
[1:30:33] that's what i said when we talk about
[1:30:34] that first four dimensions we can see
[1:30:37] that with our even with our natural
[1:30:38] lives but when we enter into that fifth
[1:30:40] dimension you've got to see something
[1:30:41] that you really can't believe
[1:30:43] how that god can give somebody eternal
[1:30:45] life and they really didn't want it
[1:30:47] and that he's got them preserved in a
[1:30:48] place and even talks about them in the
[1:30:50] bible and puts them in a seal
[1:30:52] right that's kind of hard to believe but
[1:30:55] you know what
[1:30:56] this is comfortable
[1:31:00] this is not right but who all believes
[1:31:03] in comfort
[1:31:04] no i believe this way will take you to
[1:31:07] comfort
[1:31:09] i just believe that right so we got to
[1:31:12] we got to change
[1:31:14] our whole thought process to believing
[1:31:17] god for yourself
[1:31:19] take him at his word that's what he
[1:31:21] wants
[1:31:23] we're supposed to be what spoken word
[1:31:25] children
[1:31:28] not touching children spoken word
[1:31:30] children
[1:31:33] god didn't need to touch adam
[1:31:36] adam was him made manifest in another
[1:31:38] form
[1:31:39] he didn't have to go around like i said
[1:31:41] before when that when adam
[1:31:43] looked at that big old thing with with a
[1:31:45] trunk on it he said
[1:31:47] that's an elephant that's a leopard
[1:31:51] that's a duck bill platypus i'd like to
[1:31:52] talk to him about that one
[1:31:55] but god's not over going no adam no
[1:31:58] no no no god was going that's exactly
[1:32:01] what i was thinking
[1:32:03] why because it was what he was thinking
[1:32:06] it was an extension of god almighty
[1:32:09] what are you you're an extension of god
[1:32:12] on this earth exactly right
[1:32:13] we're what we're the what we're sure
[1:32:16] we're eve
[1:32:17] but the second adam is now living inside
[1:32:20] of you
[1:32:21] so second eve can't fall
