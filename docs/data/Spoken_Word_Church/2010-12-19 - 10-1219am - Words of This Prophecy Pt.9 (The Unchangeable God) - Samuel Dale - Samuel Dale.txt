here again okay come I didn't every baby see thank you thank you much you I wa for ni was not before Christmas and all through the town not a sign of baby Jesus was anywhere to be found the people were all busy with Christmas time chores like and making and shopping in Stars no one sang Away in a Manger no crib for a bed instead they sang of Santa dressed in bright red Mama read Martha Stewart and Daddy just settled down with a stocking cap as hour upon hour the presents they' wrap when what from the radio did they suddenly hear SE an ad which total big sales at Sears so away to the mall they flew like a flash buying things on credit and others with cash and as they made their way home from their trip to the mall did they think about Jesus oh no not at all their lives were so busy with their Christmas time things they had no time to remember Christ Jesus their King there were presents to WAP and cookies to bake how could they stop and remember who died for their sake to pray to the savior they had no time to stop because they needed more time to stop on Walmart on Kmart on Target on Pennies on hallmart on jails and a quick lunch of Denny's from Big stores downtown to the stores at the mall we will dashh away and visit them all and Up on the Roof there are rose such a clatter as Grandpa hung icle lights upon his brand new step ladder he hung lights that would flash he hung lights that would twirl yet he never once prayed to Jesus the light of the world so let's not be like the rest so tired and stressed let's try to remember remember that the real reason for Christmas is Jesus this December this birth in a Manger to stable his home where he came to this world to bring it great joy the future of all would rest in this boy as a man he would lay down his life for us all but it started that Christmas in a Bethlehem stall Christ eyes how they twinkle I feel how many Christ love Christ love how normous all our burdens you'll carry so as you gather together this Christmas Eve instead of being busy overworked and uptight let's put Christ back in Christmas and don't forget to accept the one get that's free because he died for you and for me amen

appreciate it appreciate all of the ones being with us today glad to see brother sweding back there with us and just say to you welcome and just you know may the Lord bless all of us amen I always make announcement around Christmas time you know a lot of people in the message they don't put up Christmas trees they don't do this they don't do that that's your business my announcements always been the same don't condemn those who put up trees in their homes we don't have one in the church period no reath no things we don't do that all right but if you want one in your home put it up for your children grandchildren and things like that but if you don't want to don't put it up just don't condemn those who do and don't condemn those who don't so that way we're just all Christians you know to be whatever you can prove this or you can prove that what good is it do to prove cuz it's not going to solve your conscience nor soothe it to prove anything just do whatever God leads you to do and just don't condemn everybody else for doing something you don't agree with you know because that's the main thing I always make that announcement around the time of Christmas okay if you like turning your scriptures turn to Revelations 1 where we've been reading and then we want to go from there we'll go to Malachi 3 Revelations 1 Malachi 3 but we truly do appreciate the the children the adults who put on the program and everything and all the work that they've done we certainly certainly appreciate it but just you know we we pray that God will bless you and I think we've got the best I don't know what you call him but uh I really like the moderator guy I guess you call the fell who done the talk and and the begin and you know I like that didn't you amen let's just pray before we read our scripture father we thank you for this day we thank you for the opportunity because truly we know who and what Christmas is about the world has its own ways and all but we know who and where the Christmas really started and it didn't start just as a a man's ideas because it's not that and Lord is talking about a savior who come to Earth and was was a baby and Lord as we saw a sign there the other day you know babies can grow up to be Kings but there's only one king who come is really a baby thank you Father for that opportunity to be able to understand the truth and it'll set us free as we read your word now you come and speak to our hearts and just have your way with each and every one of us in Jesus name amen okay Revelations 1 now remember we will be having the watch Night Service on the 31st starting at 8:00 and we will be speaking for a while and then we will have questions and answers for whatever time so if you have any questions comments Etc uh bring them along but now I wouldn't I wouldn't wait until then to be able to um think about what's being said I might be laying a lot of things in order that where when we get to there I can just say do you remember that and I don't have to repr preach it okay so I would pay attention to things all right remember the Bible study will be uh the second Saturday in January for this coming time because the the uh uh first Saturday would be you know first will be on Saturday so it'll be the second Saturday okay remember that and I think I've got all up the ministers meeting will be on that day also here at the church starting about 11:00 and all so that won't TI up too much okay father we thank you we love you and we ask one thing of you and that's that you would come Among Us in a mighty way and that you'd speak to our hearts and our lives forgive our sins Lord lead us by thine understanding as we read your word you come and honor your word and back it up with signs following because we believe you and we pray that you would just bless each one that has gathered here today and that your love and your grace would be with us we love you and we thank you and we commit it all to you now in Jesus name amen Revelation 1:1 and the Revelation this is the revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave unto him now here's a key that I wish you watch it didn't say the revelation of Jesus right now hold that until watch not service it says the revelation of Jesus Christ right right right amen right now which God gave unto him to show unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass and he sent and signified it by his Angel unto his servant John who by record of the word of God and of the testimony of Jesus Christ and of all things that he saw blessed is he that readeth and they that hear the words of this prophecy and keep those things which are written therein for the time is at hand the time to understand amen okay Malachi 3 says what what for I am the Lord I change not right therefore ye sons of Jacob are not consumed oh my okay you may be seated the Lord at his Blessing to the reading of the word now the reason they're not consumed is because God don't change right if they were if it was that God would change then uh they we would all be consumed all right now over in uh Hebrews Hebrews 4 7 and 24 we see that God has an unchangeable priesthood right it was an unchangeable priesthood talking about mzc all right now so keep that in mind because that's what I want you to think with me about the top title of the message is this is number nine of of words of this prophecy but we're going to talk a little bit about the unchangeable God now as we read there in Malachi he said I'm God and I change not and I said a moment ago if he did change who would have a hope so you wouldn't have nothing you could depend on if God ever changed anywhere how could you depend upon it you'd be depending upon one thing one time and trying to depend upon something else at another time all right so now keep that thought in mind that you know he says Hebrews 13:8 what that he's the same yesterday and today and forever now my whole point will be based on one thing whatever God done it any any time he must do that continually or he would be changing somewhere right all right now very simple thought but I want you to get it now that's why the prophet of God said it like this he said if you can find in the Bible what God said he said you can call him on the scene and if he don't bring that to Pi he said you can call him a liar now that's strong is it but I mean that's what he said you say well that's only for him he didn't say it that way but that's your business what you think but now listen whatever God has ever done if he does it one time you must you can Bank on that that that's the way he'll Act every time now we change in what we think sure amen but God does not change all right now if he changes in any form now make it plain blunt up front if you can find where God changed in any form you can find any contradictions that's what a lot of people think is in the Bible and they think it's in the message too you know if you can find a contradiction then You' be able ble to prove that God changed am cuz he couldn't keep things you know he couldn't keep it straight all right that's why that we should be you know very careful about what we do to be able to keep our word right you know now because see if we won't keep our word God doesn't have to keep now listen to what I said he doesn't have to keep his but he will amen he will he'll keep it even though we don't keep our word right he'll keep his word why because he's God Amen John 111 what in the beginning was the word word was with God and the Word was God all right now we don't believe in trinitarianism and two or three different gods you know neither do we believe in the Oneness concept of that and and you know to me there's a middle of the road amen but the middle of the road cannot deny scriptures right we say you know people used to say I I got a scripture to shoot down your scripture you know like we was in a battle like Gunslingers you know shooting at each other or some kind of I got a quote it'll knock down your quotes well I don't believe it that way I believe what the prophet had to correct he corrected and anything else we better leave leave it alone all right I believe the Bible didn't have to be corrected all right now the prophet made human mistakes in staying things like white horse rider or something like that you know but he corrected that right all right now that's what we were going to get to one of these days somewhere probably after the first of the year but you know I'm trying to lay down some thoughts to you to where that when I want to get to the point that I want to say what I want to say then I can just say remember this remember this remember this we don't have to repr preach the message you said well just's give it to us right now if I did you wouldn't understand it he said boy you're blunt well it's true right why not say It Like It Is Well you mean the Holy Ghost can't reveal Holy Ghost can't reveal it unless somebody brings it to you oh now wait just a minute now well you you read your Bible that's what somebody brought to you right right you read The Prophet's message that's what somebody brought to you right so you understand what I mean Faith comth by hearing hearing by the word all right now but think on these things now the whole point is one thing that God can in no way ever change right so that way we can depend upon that now there's a lot of quotes in here that we'll give to you about the way he would say you know that if you ever heal one person and the other person reach that same place he's got to heal them that's right right ever save one person anybody else ever reach that place in faith he's got to save them right all right that's the way but I don't want you to necessarily hang on to that thought listen I want you to hang on to this thought if God ever done anything the way he done it one time he must continue to do that amen or else you'd have him changing so now we're involved that if he ever saved anybody if he ever healed anybody if he ever done anything but just remember now what I'm getting at cuz it's laid down here in the Book of Revelations the most beautiful thing you may wonder why that I I've kept reading in that and I keep reading it in Revelations 1 but that's the most beautiful scripture could ever be thought of right the revelation of Jesus Christ that God gave unto him to give unto his servant that's the greatest scripture you could ever think of you say well that proves a trinity cuz you got a god revealing to a son to reveal to the Holy Ghost get well I told you we don't believe in trinitarianism but I believe I believe God this is the way I believe the other things we've been talking about the Angels cuz that's where it is in here you know going to the angel that come to John and different things I believe there the calls ministers and preachers Etc calls them Angels Church age Messengers are called Angels right uh many things are called angels all then ministering spirits that come and the prophet said that the redeemed have only the redeemed have Angels so you have an angel you say well I've never contacted mine I don't know nothing about him well I read you to quote where the Prophet said it so it's not my fault he said the reason that we don't get in contact with our Angel is because the life we live did you remember that quote the life we live keeps that angel from coming to us brother brandom said I live so close to God until it forces the gift to work now that's what he had to say about so now don't blame the person sitting next to you you know right or the preacher that's preaching to you for not getting closer to God it's your problem it's your responsibility and if you don't get close to God then the angel won't contact you now that's what your Prophet said but see you don't like that and have I become your enemy because I found where the Prophet said it you when when Paul said have I become your enemy because I tell you the truth well see have I become your enemy because that you don't believe it well that's up to you but you see there's angels as I said there's preachers there's ministers there's Church AE Messengers there's Angels given to each Born Again believer and then there's cherubims and then there's Sims to keep the worshipper clean and then there's the holy ghost that can be called the angel of God that's right now to me it's all a work of the Holy Ghost right amen that's what I've been trying to get you to see it's all the work of the Holy Ghost whether it's the preacher preaching to you or the angel that contacts you you know your own personal angel or whether you're talking about brother Brandon being an angel or you're talking about the serim the prophet said uh there that would keep the worshiper clean it's all the work of the Holy Spirit that's why it's called there in the scripture we gave it to You' been over it's called ministering spirits that Minister unto the hours of Salvation now it doesn't say they're there for everybody in the world only the redeemed have Angels see and then see you say Well only the redeem have the Holy Ghost well all right you're talking right amen that's true only to redeem to have the Holy Ghost but just don't do away with all the other things it comes up to the Holy Ghost right is my point why don't you pray for to for God to let your angel come down and touch you talk to you now we're not worship of angels right that's right we're taking the scripture but you see whatever God does he never changes so what is his order what would be his pattern his order his way of doing then it would always start coming as we read in Revelations 1 it starts with God revealing to Jesus Christ and Jesus Christ revealing to his Angel and the angel coming talking to John that's always the order right that's always been God's order amen it's always been that he as he would start to condescend that he brings forms into view that will and I write this down he brings forms into view that will Express his character and his nature and his attributes because it is him right and without that order of events taking place there is no way for it to be revealed to us oh all we need the Holy Ghost that's all we need that the Holy Ghost well you can't get the Holy Ghost if you don't follow the pattern that's right now you can get anointings that's right you can get all kind of things right but you can't be in the right order right amen would we want to follow God's ways right Lord willing on the watch Night Service you'll see that as it comes down that he has not changed his ways none whatsoever amen the way he done it in the beginning he's always doing it and then when he starts the book of Revelations is exactly to tell you how he done it in the beginning right amen the Revelation that God give to Jesus Christ give to his servant amen he sent and signified it see by an Angel now why can't we believe that cuz he doesn't change all right let's read a few amen we're going have to get in a hurry but message hear you him brother ROM 1960 uh 313 when God's ever called on the scene in the way God acts the first time he has to act forever that way right if he didn't he acted wrong at the first place right he done something wrong but you notice when God acts he acts every time the same that's right now if a sinner called and he Sav that sinner the next sinner calls he's got to save the next Center the next Center the next Center the next Center and all that call if a man calls for healing of his body and God heals him then the next one the next one the next one one that calls got to be healed on the basis of faith for either one that's right now but I say it now listen we'll take that and we'll just lay on healing or salvation I mean that's the the two things we lay it on right it's just healing or salvation but I want you to to lock in with me and I'll keep repeating this to where that you'll realize that God never changes in any way amen that's right the way he done something one time he'll do it again amen right why can't we depend on it the way he revealed something to to brother Donnie if we'll come in the same way and pray and seek God he'll reveal to us amen amen and we're not trying to be like brother brandham but the way he revealed himself to brother brandham is exactly how he'll reveal himself to you go brother random can't reveal anything to you that's where people go wrong with it y amen they think they read it and that means theyve got it now it's got to be revealed that's what I've been over and over and over with you amen how many times have I made this statement although that angel could come to John on patmas and there in in the first chapter and be there if Jesus Christ had not come on the scene amen it would make no difference that's right amen cuz the Holy Ghost is the only revealer of the word well I read what the prophet said well thank God now you got the seed laying there ask the Holy Ghost to Quicken it well I it was quick in the minute I read it well where you got that at well I got a quote from the prophet said you bring the word in and said you bring it in and said he'll Quicken his quick your brain in right I agree with you cuz that's what he said that's true but if it's brought in pure and unadulterated he'll Quicken it but if it's brought in in partial realization are messed up doctrines he cannot Quicken a a messed up Doctrine well the Holy Ghost reveal that that's up to you that's right I just say one thing he can't reveal anything outside of his word right that's right now if he does he ain't God right that's as blunt as can be but it's as straight as can be look what he says expectation 1961 here's the way I want you to believe it now that God is is infinite he's omnipresent omniscient and he's almighty God he's the same yesterday today and forever he cannot change and be God whatever God does one time makes his decision that decision has to remain forever it can never be changed God if God makes a decision this year and next year he changes that that shows he wasn't God cuz he's infinite and we are finite he going down talking about how that God keeps his word right you read all of these things Feast of the the trumpets 1964 719 he's talking about down Through the Ages and the seals and Etc God is unchangeable Malachi 4 Malachi 3 says I am God and I change not God's first way of doing anything that's God's ever way of doing anything God decided he'd save Man by The Shed blood of an innocent one in the Garden of Eden and he has never changed it since amen and he cannot change it we try by education by building by by service by denominations systems by denomination by ethics and everything else it's all fail but there's only one place that God meets man that's under the shed blood only by the blood that's his first decision listen Ephesian Church age page 66 God manifest himself in her talking about to Bri the word can't change or be changed because the word is God Amen John 1:1 in the beginning was the word word with God and the Word was God to change one word of it as Eve did bring sin and death even as it says in Revelations 22:18 and 19 you know where that's over there if you had to to take away thus what the church at Pentecost is the standard that is the pattern there's no other pattern no no matter what the scholars say God has not changed that pattern but he can't change it he's God do you understand what I'm getting now right God identified him identifying himself 64 320 his characteristics never fails it's always is the same now remember his characteristics the characteristics of God cannot fail if it does then God God's failed and the Bible said in Hebrews 13:8 that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever therefore he is the unchangeable god whatever character he was at the beginning he is still that same character every way he worked anytime he ever done anything he does it the same every same way every time if he doesn't his character has changed see and his characteristics would display something that wasn't of God see so we wouldn't know words and we can't depend on them right characteristics change we can't depend on it right Jehovah Gyra 1 1964 402 God has not changed his ways God is the unchangeable god the way God does anything one time he has to do it the same way the second time remember when you see God action in any time if he if a man was lost and he saved a man upon the basis of any certain decision he made listen he has to to Always Forever stay with that same decision that's God see he cannot change it see he's he's infinite we're finite but God he's perfect infinite everything he does is perfect he can't make a decision today and make a better one tomorrow his first decision is perfect therefore you can just hang your soul on anything he says it's the truth now that is repeated later if you'll find it CU I want you to read it that's why I believe like I do that see whatever happened in the Book of Revelations has got to be the exact same way that it happened in Genesis or else God changed right has he condescended downward write it down and he condescended downward is identically the same thing that the Book of Revelations is saying right amen did God condescend downward through forms and ways right well now he's telling you in the Book of Revelation that this is the life book and the book that what that brother rown said page 13 Church age book The Only book in the Bible where as Jesus personally appearing to to a scribe and like I've always said to you you can have all the head knowledge you want people have accuse me to be an intellectual I I can't help it I love to read I can't help it I love to listen to texes if I'm an intellectual what was brother brandham right he's the one that got it from so you're making him an intellectual but see all that can be laying in your brain it's no good until the Holy Ghost reveals you but when he reveals it you don't have to worry about nothing right that's why the internet is opened up I challenge anybody to show me where I'm wrong right that's not a challenge of of mean hateful doing no I want to be right right if I can show be shown where I'm where at oh of course now I've had a lot of people walk up brother Dale you're wrong of course I'm forced to fall down on the floor and say hallelujah I got straighted out no I don't do that way give me the word right show me in the word where I'm wrong right show me in the prophet's message where I'm wrong then I won't have to worry about I'll be on the floor that's right cuz I'll be repenting and wanting to be right but you see the unchangeable God never changes his ways look at look at number nine number eight on your notes evening messenger 63116 and notice now of course we know the story behind the reason I say this you know the reason I use a lot of it after 64 or 63 you know a lot of people thinks that brother Rand was wrong up to 63 and then after 63 he got straightened out well evidently God changed because he said I taught three processes and they're saying now that that that you don't teach three processes to the birth it's just a birth run said he talk threee processes from the beginning so somebody changed it evidently was not him though cuz that's what he had to say about it so I believe the message is right and if you don't have the message from from 47 to 62 and 63 you can't understand what takes place after then amen that's right but that's that's the way people think it so I just use a lot after that see and notice now you people all must remember this that God cannot change he's the unchangeable god times changes people change God is infinite he cannot change he is he must remain the same yesterday today and forever he must always remain and if we believe this to be the word of God we can put our confidence on anything that he said amen that's a statement needs to be quoted a lot right that's why I depend upon what he say right because what he says is right but if anything ever told told me anything he said you know told them to tell me I've got to have it in the word right I'm just simple in language and that I've got to have it in the word amen well the Lord told me to tell you well amen but he can talk to me too what he did through me well why are you so arrogant about it you know why are you so upset cuz I won't accept what you say no if the Lord sent you ain't going to send you that way cuz he knows my heart on the other end okay super sign 1963 11:29 I wish you to notice the unchangeable continuity let's back up I didn't finish that one on evening messenger now you see there how his message comes right how he sends his message he can't change that so every how he send his message he's got to send it every time right now we know the word always come to the prophet right that's the way he sent his message it's no problem we got it right right now then Super sign I'm trying to hurry up I want you to notice the unchangeable continuity of God's word in his Works see he never changes his his program he never changes his ways just as perfectly the scripture is in perfect continuity everything that God does is in continuity with what he done see and what he did first watch's that what he did first that's he'll do it the second time the same way and just to prove to prove it to you he has made laws in the earth and he always given his people a sign before the event happened now he's always done it and he'll always do it because he's the unchangeable god I am God he said and I change not that's why he said his program at the beginning that's the way it is in each age and he never changes it each age had a church age messenger each age had the Holy Spirit each age had God to reveal each age is always had the same right he's always followed the same pattern never changed right sir as we would see Jesus 64304 he was the word and he came to John in the water now did he come to brother randam in the water that right he come to John the Baptist in the water the of that day right he come to the Elijah of this day in the water he didn't change his ways right he keeps it every time he never changes his system he never changes his ways he's the unchangeable God now the church did did not believe that by no mean look at it how many of us believe but that didn't stop the program of God it went right on unchangeable God 62 120 or one yeah 120 the unchangeable God will give you the same holy ghost that he gave them there without a change he will do the same things that he did when he was here on Earth to any man or woman that'll believe it and accept it right if you got the Holy Ghost take a hold of it like Jacob did and hold to it un it until positive results change comes believe it friends and at an unexpected time time and maybe an unexpected date but he will do it at an unexpected date how much more should he do it tonight in an unexpected place where we're expecting to see it happen H listen future home 64 802 notice how God makes plain to us the Plan of Redemption oh this just thrilled my soul when I saw it he he makes plain to us here now his Plan of Redemption now compare what we see with our own eyes what God has done to redeem his world he's done the same thing to redeem his people for the unchangeable god changes not any of his plans or anything such a glorious thing am the way he saved the world the way he's going to save an individual unchangeable it doesn't change at all list amen glorify uh excuse me God identified himself 64 320 his characteristics never fails it's always is the same now remember his characteristics the characteristics of God cannot change if it does then he's failed see these are some of these are repeat okay cuz I want it there and the Bible said in Hebrews 13:8 the same yesterday today and forever therefore he is the unchangeable god whatever character he was at the beginning he is still that same character every way he worked anytime he ever done anything he does it the same way every time if he doesn't he his character is changed that's a repeat back over on the other okay the next one is a repeat God has not changed his ways God is the unchangeable god the only way God the way God does anything one time he has to do it the same way the second time remember when you see God's action in any of it listen the unchanging God number 15 never changes as as Christ is identified to same 644 414 4:15 excuse the unchangeable God never changes his way of doing things God has one way of doing things and he doesn't change at all when man sinned and fell in the Garden of Eden and God made a way for that man to be to be saved he never changed his ways he never changed s Christ is identified the same 64 4:15 that's the only place that he will meet us the unchanging God he never changes his way of doing things he talking about through the blood and through the coming down the order of the shed blood his characteristics prove that he doesn't change himself he never deals with groups he deals with individuals he doesn't change that nature the only time he changes is when he goes to Israel he go to a group but he's still dealing to individuals make up a group there amen all right last one why had to be Shepherd 641 12:21 now you see the unchanging God in his unchanging plans of his word this day now just think a few minutes the unchanging word right now listen he said I'm God and I change not soever how he revealed himself one time right he will always reveal himself to son amen people say the Lord revealed to me a trinity Now where's that at in the Bible amen well you mean to tell me that he didn't reveal it no I'm just telling you ain't in the Bible you know they said to that you know them women preachers they said well I'm called to preach brother bandam said I'm just going to tell you it's not in the Bible that's right you know why because they believe there called you know why because they did get a call you know why CU they forced their way into it but God didn't change that's right God didn't change what he said one time you don't change it he said I'm God and I change not then why did they make a trinity out of it right exactly he didn't say I'm God's right plural he said I'm God and I changed nothing he said unless you believe that I am he you'll die in your sins now that was a man that was walking on earth right he said I'm God and I change not therefore the sons of Jacob which is who we are you know they don't mean Israelites okay that means Jacob is what shyers deceivers Trier ERS that's who we all were till we got born again right amen we were the sons of Jacob not the sons of Israel right the sons of Jacob dirty Heathen he said he I won't destroy you if you believe that I Chang not but if you think I Chang then where did I change at show me where God changed brother Adam one time made a statement like this cuz he's human he said I used to think Jesus loved me and the father hated me right or God hated me he said I found out this self same person right amen we know that was his human ideas and him being a prophet he had that thought cuz he said he did he but see when you find out God don't change come on then you can depend on Amen you know I like to be on time and I hate it when you're not on time that gets me more than anything in the world if I'm coming to your house I'm going to be early almost got shot doing that went to take my gun one time to a man's house and he told me to be there at 9:00 well I didn't understand I I thought 9:00 you know he just said a time for me to be there I pull up in his yard at about 8:15 and man he comes out there I told you to be here at 9:00 I said well I'm sorry sir I just you know I'm just trying to be early cuz I'm always trying to well you early set off my alarms he had a big gun there with him you know so I told him I said okay I'll leave and be back at 9:00 but I'll be here about 1 or 2 minutes after 9 okay you know that's where I was I pulled out sat out on the highway went to town got me something to drink come back and set out there on the road then I pulled in his driveway 2 minutes after after: I understand I didn't get mad at him and tell him all I said sir I understand I'm always on time but I'm always early he just finally said oh that's all right it just it just set off my alarm in the house and cuz he had a lot of guns he worked you know but see what are you going to do the day comes when the bus pulls up and to take in the Rapture and you going to be late right it ain't going to wait on you that's right that's right I start being early amen oh that's right you know of course now if you like to be seen oh if you like everybody to notice you you're always late right you don't never notice nobody's early you always notice everybody's late so they come down to the AIS of the church you know hi hi this me I'm here start the service well I don't like that that's right sorry about that I'm just like to be on time cuz see I believe in a God that's on time amen I believe in a God that will keep his word I can depend on that the reason I can believe that I'm Healed is because he said I am right the reason I believe I'm saved is not because I seen this I seen that right no it's because I believe what he said right I told you about it I seen an angel of God in a church or something when I was 11 years old I never came counted that as my salvation never have no way my salvation is based upon what this word says believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shalt be saved it don't change Satan can impersonate all those other things and give you all kind of signs and wonders that's right that's right you can see Angels you can see all kind of things around it don't make no difference if you can't stay with his word right amen you see if he won't change his word then me you are not changed show me where I've ever changed now I've tried to grow greater and greater in the message in the Lord and understanding yes but show me wherever changeed you know we never taught our children that Santa Claus come down to a chimney we always try to teach them about Jesus Christ they might have believed it because everybody else taught it but we never taught it we took when we were before we ever even heard of this message we monitored the things that our kids saw on TV that was in the 60s folks they were not allowed to see certain things why because I've always believed in being a Christian if God don't change why should we change now we should change for the better okay all right I always need to change for the better but now show me where I ever followed any of these doctrines that's come out and I studied every one of them you know why cuz I got to talk I got to preach to you whether it's right or wrong right right show me any of those doctrines that I ever fell in to their camps and went with them not a one now how many preachers can say that of course see when you say it that away they think you're sarcastic hateful arrogant Old Goat well I'm a sar sarcastic arrogant hateful Old Goat but I've always believed what God said that's right and I come in this message and heard what that Prophet said I didn't have any more idea is of my own I changed to believe what he said and to search out what he said because if I was going to believe him to be the prophet of Malachi 4 I was supposed to believe what he said that's right everything he said well then what about well that's like I said he corrected those y he corrected the things that were not right but see everybody now is correcting him well I sure hate to have to try to believe in his message if I going to correct him right but see God don't change you mean he can't keep his message right that's right well brother Dale brother so and so says this and brother so and so and says that and say I don't have nothing to do with it what is the Bible say right what if the prophet's message say right it says I'm God I change not so every how he revealed himself here in to John is exactly the way he revealed himself in Genesis now that's a key hold that quote in your mind what he done in Genesis he done it here in Revelations cuz that's the two books that you need to to read cuz that's the two books that Satan tries to keep you out of cuz Genesis shows you the origin and all like that shows you Satan The Book of Revelations identically starts off the same way to show you exactly who God is the revelation of Jesus Christ not Jesus the flesh right Jesus Christ that God gave unto him well you mean Jesus was God he's supposed to understand everything no he was limited cuz he limited himself right you remember how I preached it God limited himself right there not no man going to put no limit on God God limited himself he covered Us by the blood and he can't see us now isn't that a way of God limiting himself now don't tell me he don't know what we do but he's got it it's covered he's God and he Chang is not amen that's the way I depend upon the message right if I can find where brother Brown said it is a good thing but if I can find where he kept on saying it whether it be in the early Ministry or in the later Ministry but see like one big man in this message he said I don't like Bill's Oneness Doctrine you know Oneness talk language who are you right who gives anybody a right a prophet stands before nobody that's right right right right amen not that he wouldn't take correction no sir reading I don't get wrong but he stands before nobody but God himself amen that's right God had to straighten him out that's right he believed like the evidence of the Holy Ghost was love God straightened him out that showed him that was whether or not the spirit in you would continue to agree with the word he took that correction from God but he never got it from man on Earth that's right he might have heard somebody say something but God had to come down what about it what kind of a god do you believe in well down here he was this and over here he was that and over here something else no that's not Hebrew 13:8 that's right what he ever said he must keep it amen or he's not God keep that in your mind the unchangeable god starts off in Genesis showing you what happened how God condescended starts off in Revelation to show you a condescend go the Book of Revelation the entire Bible right that's right cuz he shows you what now I quoting brother around the seal shows you what has been what is and what will be so he showed the whole plan all the way back from the beginning we can find it in simple language let's stand together we're going to eat together and fellowship together so let's just sing if anybody has a need just brother dick come with the music music and if anybody has a need then the altar is open come and let's see if God is real let's see if God the musician just come on y'all all come on we'll sing CU some the sisters going to be getting things ready and everything so the musicians come on let's sing some and all and then we'll go downstairs and eat together Fellowship together we invite everybody to stay with us and have a good time eating together and just you know think about him does your God change if he does how can you depend on it if he said one thing in one place and something else somewhere else how can you depend on Amen no way what it is is he said something in one place and then we try to find something else that looks like he changed his mind no uh-uh the grace of marriage and divorce was not God changing his mind you better get that straight that's right that was God God's word from the beginning right amen it was not God changing his mind right brother R said it because of a question in God's word there was not a question in God's word there was a question of mankind of what God Said in his word there was no question by God in his word right it's a question of mankind that had studied it right thought he had it figured out y God don't change his mind amen that's right what he said one time he's all wait go ahead let's find number 79 and just start with in the Red Book 79 in the red book if anybody has a need while the sisters are getting everything ready Glory hallu planing by the water be I shall not be I shall not be I shall not I shall not be just like a planted by the water shall not be oh the

well God said it's all right for me to do so and so now where's that in the Bible if it was ever you ever never heard brother Bram talk about it you never heard him make the statement we're living in the AG when women just paint their face cut their hair clothes and right but he says now if your grandmother went out like that said they loock her up right well they just had grow in Grace knowledge what it was you they they just didn't know now he's trying to make us a statement right you know there's not a scripture in the New Testament talks about a man a woman wearing a pair of pants that's right can't find one can you you can't find a New Testament scripture says wrong for a woman to wear pants you that's Old Testament scripture but you know if it's Hebrews 13:8 it still means the same well now it's all right here but it's wrong back there like I told you about that boy talking to him about water baptism and I said the correct way to be baptized is in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ he said that's right boy I thought now I got somebody to talk to I said yeah that's where it's always been I said you know well it started out back there he said yep when it started out back there he said they baptized the name of Lord Jesus Christ he said now we baptize Father Son and Holy Ghost because we know the truth he said there's trinitarians the reason they needed to be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ you know what I never talk to him anymore go why talk to the Devil Himself I'm not making the man that why talk to something like that that his mind was so Twisted that he thought in the book of Acts he supposed to baptize the name of the Lord Jesus Christ but now we baptized Father Son and Holy Ghost because we know the truth he didn't know he was the pope himself M cuz that's what they believe but see God don't change go ahead brother find out if ready do you believe it God can't God told me my children would be saved I took his word why don't you if he tell you something s in the G one day talking to my wife I told her something was going to take place she said it won't do it I said I'll never preach again if it don't she said You Preach your life sermon well you know what naturally I would agree with it I said that ain't got nothing to do with it God told me and that's the way it's going to be you know what why can't you depend on him like that why can't you put your whole life on this word if this word not right I don't want to serve a God that can't keep his word God has to change his mind every time somebody else come alone how I don't want to serve a God Like That CU he's not my God he's like we are he has to change his mind every time he turns around God don't do that when he said it in the beginning he's got to keep his word he said he would send Jesus Christ and he did he said he would send this message in the last days and he did what about it she G the heavenly they will never pass away God changing to God Ching your of Jesus Christ would after the order of M Jed unchangable the scripture said priesthood God you're in back me oh to God God oh to God un changing hold his hand don't worry about it he ain't
