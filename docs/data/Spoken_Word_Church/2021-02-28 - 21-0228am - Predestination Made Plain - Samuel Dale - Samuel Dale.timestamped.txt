[1:46] years of trying to
[1:48] preach about predestination
[1:51] and to get it in the right order to
[1:53] where that we can understand we will not
[1:56] read the whole lot we're just going to
[1:58] try to preach about it
[2:00] to where you can can understand at least
[2:02] what we're saying and then we'll give
[2:04] you what the prophet has said and and
[2:07] you shouldn't know enough of it anyway
[2:09] but you know think on these things on
[2:11] predestination and we'll try to be
[2:14] trying to make it plain as we can all
[2:16] right father we thank you for this day
[2:18] and your grace unto us thank you for
[2:20] loving us thank you for everything
[2:23] just have your way
[2:24] and come among us and open our eyes to
[2:26] that understanding that we may see you
[2:29] and want to walk into your love and
[2:31] grace
[2:32] forgive our sins and lead us in thy
[2:34] grace and love lord remember the sick
[2:36] among us you know the needs that are
[2:38] there and many many sicknesses our wife
[2:41] still having troubles with old sinuses
[2:43] and
[2:44] the things that's still bothering lord
[2:45] and we know that satan is doing
[2:47] everything he can to hinder in every way
[2:49] lord
[2:50] all of these that are sick among us we
[2:52] just ask you to come and take it away
[2:55] because we believe you
[2:57] and we thank you for it and saying that
[2:59] by your stripes we are healed
[3:01] we love you in jesus name amen
[3:05] okay romans
[3:07] 8.
[3:10] we're going to verse 28
[3:12] and we know that all things work
[3:14] together for good to them that love god
[3:18] to them who are the called according to
[3:21] his purpose
[3:23] for whom he did predict for for whom he
[3:26] did for no
[3:28] he also did predestinate
[3:32] what to be conformed to the image of his
[3:35] son now your predestination we we won't
[3:38] get to it but you remember your
[3:40] predestination is your destiny
[3:43] and so then that's why he's saying it
[3:46] that
[3:47] we're we're predestinated to a certain
[3:49] place in this day
[3:51] to the image of his son that he might be
[3:53] the firstborn among many brethren
[3:55] moreover whom he did predestinate them
[3:58] he also called and whom he called then
[4:00] he also justified in whom he justified
[4:03] them he also glorified now i love this
[4:06] scripture right here what shall we
[4:08] then say
[4:10] to these things
[4:13] all the things he's just said what can
[4:15] we say
[4:17] if god be for us
[4:19] who can be against us you may be seated
[4:21] the lord at his blessing to the reading
[4:22] of the word
[4:23] now i would ask you i know
[4:26] it's not you sitting here that's doing
[4:28] it but i'm just asking you to something
[4:31] uh
[4:36] you know when the phone rings here i
[4:37] mean i'm we're honest and sincere and
[4:39] try to do
[4:40] but just like while ago you were
[4:42] worshiping and things and then all at
[4:43] once here comes a phone call in well
[4:46] i understand that i understand and try
[4:49] to anyway
[4:50] but
[4:51] uh try not to make those phone calls
[4:54] coming in during the worship service the
[4:56] ministry and let it be before the
[4:58] service
[4:59] we're glad to pray for your needs and
[5:02] things like that you know and all and
[5:05] but
[5:06] try not to be unless it's what you call
[5:08] a dire emergency you know just a real
[5:11] real emergency
[5:13] that would would need something you know
[5:16] call before the service or after the
[5:18] service
[5:20] because everybody in here hears the
[5:21] phone ringing
[5:23] and then everybody in here wonders is it
[5:25] for me
[5:26] see how you interrupt the whole service
[5:30] to get in your little call
[5:33] and i don't mean this wrong now i mean
[5:36] seriously and you call in say i got a
[5:38] tummy ache or my car quit
[5:41] you know and then you're interrupting
[5:42] the whole service
[5:45] for us to pray about your car
[5:47] you know or something
[5:49] we'll do it before the service
[5:52] do it after the service
[5:56] you know
[5:57] don't don't do that like that to her you
[6:00] know what we say well but my my you know
[6:02] i've asked you to cut your phones off i
[6:04] know
[6:05] i know you have not done it
[6:08] because every once in a while we get a
[6:09] little accident and somebody just comes
[6:11] through right and you get to hear them
[6:13] in the service
[6:14] but i've asked you to cut your phones
[6:16] off
[6:18] this is a service time this is a time we
[6:20] are to be worshiping god
[6:23] not to be talking on
[6:24] uh what's that uh
[6:26] thing
[6:28] the name of it
[6:30] yeah what
[6:31] facebook yeah we're this is not the time
[6:34] of facebook this is not the time of of
[6:36] keeping up with whether or not you've
[6:38] gone to the bathroom three times today
[6:40] you know and
[6:41] you know something like that on facebook
[6:44] you know that that that's that means no
[6:47] if it's an emergency
[6:50] call in yeah
[6:53] but not to just say well well
[6:55] i'm i i'm just no see you're
[6:58] interrupting the
[7:00] services now and i'm just going to say
[7:03] it this way because i can't you know
[7:05] you say well well i'm not going to order
[7:08] you to not turn your phones on
[7:13] because i don't have to
[7:15] i'm not going to order you to wear your
[7:18] face mask
[7:21] but you ought to
[7:24] i'm not going to order you to not call
[7:27] in on a phone call
[7:30] but you don't not do it
[7:33] see the reason i'm not going to order it
[7:35] because if i have to order you to do it
[7:38] then that's that becomes a childish
[7:40] situation
[7:42] right if i've got to order you to come
[7:44] to church on sunday morning and sunday
[7:46] night
[7:47] and wednesday nights you know
[7:49] then
[7:50] you don't
[7:51] you're not in involved in this situation
[7:55] that's right you're not you're not a
[7:57] christian
[7:59] because you're not displaying the way of
[8:01] a christian right well brother dale i
[8:03] was just
[8:04] you know
[8:06] i've said it i mean it
[8:08] we try to do everything sure all right
[8:12] emergencies
[8:14] the phone call is about the phone is
[8:16] there for emergencies something comes in
[8:19] all right
[8:21] that's emergencies but not just to do it
[8:24] every day and do it you know and sit
[8:25] there and look over on your thing and
[8:29] i watch some of you and you know you're
[8:34] you know
[8:35] you're doing it you've been doing it you
[8:37] didn't stop doing it and you're not
[8:40] going to stop doing it
[8:42] so i was praying in there before i came
[8:44] out i said lord
[8:45] give me some way to express what i'm
[8:47] saying without people getting all upset
[8:50] and then run the rest of the service
[8:54] because that's what you're doing you get
[8:55] your feelings hurt so you won't listen
[8:57] to what i'm talking you won't listen to
[8:59] what i'm preaching
[9:02] but you'll you'll be sitting in your
[9:04] little pity party
[9:05] world and you won't be doing it right
[9:08] you interrupt the services the prophet
[9:10] said that's your responsibility between
[9:12] you and god
[9:16] you get up and run to the bathroom
[9:18] backwards and forth
[9:21] you can go before the service
[9:26] i see brother ray there
[9:28] brother ray when the singing song comes
[9:30] apart here
[9:32] before hit the service starts for us to
[9:35] you know to come out or anything and he
[9:36] goes to the bathroom and comes back all
[9:38] right
[9:39] that's good
[9:41] that's respectable right
[9:44] now we're trying to talk about
[9:46] christianity this is something now i'm
[9:49] going to say it and then you can take
[9:50] what you want to
[9:52] i mean we had respect in the baptist
[9:54] church
[9:57] we respected the rules and regulations
[9:59] in the baptist church
[10:02] methodist presbyterian whatever you come
[10:04] from and you know what i'm fixing to say
[10:06] is true you go to some of the churches
[10:08] of this message and they're going to
[10:10] personally call you out
[10:13] if you keep going to the bathrooms and
[10:15] back and things they're going to make
[10:17] you
[10:18] they're going to show you they rule the
[10:20] place
[10:21] well i don't try to do that
[10:24] it's only going to hurt feelings
[10:26] when it hurts feelings you're not going
[10:27] to listen to what god's talking about
[10:30] i'm trying my best to get you to see
[10:33] what it is to be a christian
[10:35] and what god's word is
[10:39] we've had the greatest message that has
[10:41] ever been delivered
[10:43] because it was delivered to the small
[10:46] things
[10:48] all the way to the top
[10:51] it was made from the simple things all
[10:53] the way to the deepest things that could
[10:56] be thought of
[10:58] and i i mean we should honor and respect
[11:00] that
[11:02] you know
[11:04] yeah but i'm i'm i know what that's what
[11:05] i said you see you you already caught
[11:08] that and it's it's already hurting your
[11:10] feelings and already doing but just
[11:12] remember
[11:14] try to do the best you can
[11:17] try to do the best you can
[11:19] you know
[11:21] just just uh
[11:23] okay
[11:25] don't forgive me for what i said because
[11:27] i'm not going to ask for forgiveness
[11:30] i'm just going to say to you
[11:32] i thought we were supposed to be
[11:34] christians
[11:36] to act and do and live like christians
[11:39] that's all that i've thought about you
[11:41] know doing well you think i'm not a
[11:42] christian like one brother i said
[11:44] something to him
[11:45] about it and he went and told everybody
[11:47] and quit coming to church here
[11:49] won't come now
[11:50] why because brother dale said that he
[11:52] wasn't a christian i didn't say that
[11:56] i never said that or whatsoever you know
[11:59] what i said i said a christian don't act
[12:01] like that right
[12:04] you say well you said the same thing
[12:06] okay
[12:08] i said the same thing christians don't
[12:11] act like that
[12:12] the prophet talked about little feelings
[12:14] that we have you know and things little
[12:16] hurt feelings and things with us being
[12:18] christians that we shouldn't have them
[12:21] you know
[12:23] okay just just think about all right now
[12:27] we finished up the series part about the
[12:30] um
[12:34] fact of god and his ways and his doings
[12:37] and
[12:38] how that it was back before the world
[12:40] and we come through that to bring out
[12:42] the things and
[12:43] and bringing it down to where that we're
[12:45] living and bringing it to where the
[12:47] message of the hour
[12:49] is showing us the one true and living
[12:52] god
[12:54] that is you know here to do and do all
[12:58] the things and took it all way back from
[13:00] before the foundation world and went all
[13:02] the way forward to the future as to the
[13:05] bride of jesus christ ending it up in
[13:07] the message that
[13:09] the bride of jesus christ will be in the
[13:11] last days according to your prophet now
[13:15] not according to brother dale not
[13:16] according to anybody else according to
[13:19] your prophet that you claim to believe
[13:23] everything he says
[13:26] all right
[13:28] but according to your prophet
[13:30] then
[13:31] the bride is to be the fullness of the
[13:34] godhead bodily
[13:36] now well you said but i just don't see
[13:38] it well you know what go home and look
[13:40] in the mirror and ask yourself a
[13:42] question am i living like a christian or
[13:45] am i acting like a
[13:48] bastard child
[13:50] because bastard children can't be
[13:52] forgiven
[13:54] are we acting like christians or bastard
[13:56] children you know in our doings and
[13:58] things see that's what hinders us from
[14:00] understanding
[14:02] if we say we don't believe
[14:04] now
[14:05] that you know that
[14:07] the bride is to be the fullness of the
[14:09] godhead by then you're making the
[14:10] prophet a liar
[14:12] now you ain't gonna like ass yeah i say
[14:14] you know no you ain't gonna like that at
[14:17] all
[14:18] because you know no i'm not i believe
[14:19] everything he says well then
[14:24] you know
[14:25] let's act like we believe it
[14:28] let's talk about being it and believing
[14:31] it
[14:32] see that's where our trouble is at we
[14:33] don't believe what the bible says about
[14:36] us
[14:38] well it's going to take somebody
[14:40] somewhere in this last days is going to
[14:42] stand on the word of god and believe god
[14:47] and come out to the bases that we can
[14:50] follow the message
[14:53] and walk off of this earth
[14:55] as a born-again christian
[14:58] be wednesday night later in the message
[15:02] but you'll forget it by the end but i'll
[15:03] say it this way
[15:06] i ask you a simple question this morning
[15:08] that's what i've been trying to do you
[15:10] remember how we went through the the
[15:12] godhead
[15:13] being plain and simple trying to bring
[15:16] it down to the level that we can talk on
[15:19] it
[15:20] and discuss it all right i want to talk
[15:22] about predestination
[15:25] in the simplest way that can be thought
[15:28] of
[15:31] the most simple way that can be thought
[15:33] of in predestination that's what we want
[15:36] to talk about
[15:38] all right see then don't get all of this
[15:40] stuff but i was before the world and i
[15:43] was here that uh we'll bring out not
[15:45] today but we'll bring it out you've got
[15:47] it brought out enough the prophet said
[15:50] were we spirits then before the world he
[15:52] said no we wasn't nothing
[15:55] we was in the mind of god
[15:59] when i want to ask you a question simple
[16:02] questions i want to ask you
[16:06] is the center in the mind of god
[16:11] he's what god thought of
[16:14] now i know the difference between being
[16:16] in the mind of god
[16:18] yeah
[16:20] and being
[16:21] the mind of god
[16:23] i don't want to be in the mind of god
[16:25] because just being in the mind of god
[16:26] everybody in the world that's going to
[16:28] be the whole thing of this morning
[16:30] everybody in the world is predestinated
[16:37] everybody
[16:38] the way your prophet brought it see then
[16:40] that does away if you can make that bold
[16:43] statement and say everybody in the world
[16:46] is predestinated the same way
[16:50] then that does away with all of this but
[16:53] i always was eternal i'm predestinate a
[16:56] special way
[17:00] that's not simple enough for me to
[17:01] understand it
[17:05] see because i've got to figure out then
[17:07] what i was and what's this and what's
[17:08] that
[17:10] but if i can take it to believe what the
[17:12] prophet had said and the bible has said
[17:14] about it
[17:16] and just believe it
[17:19] and say thank you lord
[17:22] i i may not be able to explain it but i
[17:24] believe it
[17:28] this is a simple question that will
[17:30] determine wednesday to be 40-something
[17:33] years to trying to minister about
[17:35] predestination to finally reach a point
[17:37] to where i can express at least a little
[17:40] bit about it
[17:44] how does god predestinate
[17:54] how does god predest tonight
[18:00] now
[18:02] predestination is the fact of
[18:08] according to the
[18:10] commentaries predestination is to
[18:15] predestining or determining
[18:21] means deciding beforehand
[18:26] even decreeing all the way from eternity
[18:28] and coming all the way through
[18:32] it means to a point beforehand
[18:35] predestination
[18:40] how much much more simple could you
[18:42] express the word or thought
[18:45] of predestination
[18:50] now remember one thing that i'm asking
[18:52] you to remember and get away from the
[18:53] thoughts and ideas and it'll destroy
[18:55] those doctrinals
[18:58] everybody is predestinated
[19:07] the same way
[19:09] or else you have a respect of persons
[19:15] now i was good enough no that's going to
[19:17] be a thing that we're going to hang on
[19:18] monday i mean wednesday we're going to
[19:20] hang on to it
[19:22] and we're going to nail down hard and
[19:24] strong on some thoughts
[19:29] to predetermine predestinate
[19:32] predetermined
[19:38] you've heard me tell about my dad and
[19:39] he's
[19:40] the old baptist believed in
[19:41] predestination
[19:43] and my mom was trying to explain to him
[19:45] out in the cotton field one day a little
[19:47] bit about predestination
[19:49] and uh daddy he couldn't read he
[19:51] couldn't do it but he had some pretty
[19:52] good understanding
[19:56] he talked to her about serpent seed and
[19:57] that was back before we ever heard of it
[19:59] from the prophet
[20:02] but he said is does god predestinate
[20:05] everything and she said yes
[20:07] he says did he predestinate me to pick
[20:09] that bowl of cotton she said yes he did
[20:11] he just went around it
[20:16] you said well that was silly it made a
[20:18] point
[20:21] but can your thoughts of predestination
[20:25] cover everybody in the world
[20:29] if not you have a
[20:31] predetermining factor that will not fit
[20:34] the word of god because according to the
[20:36] word of god and according to the prophet
[20:39] all things are predestinated
[20:43] that's why he could come up with that
[20:44] word and call it foreknowledge
[20:46] because that's what it is because the
[20:48] bible says those who he foreknew
[20:51] he did predestinate so what comes first
[20:54] predestination or foreknowledge
[20:59] if god determines something to be
[21:01] without giving a choice
[21:03] or or anything of the matter then he is
[21:06] a respecter of persons
[21:08] and he's picking and choosing whether
[21:09] you like the idea or not
[21:11] well i like the idea of thinking that i
[21:13] was something before the world
[21:17] what was you
[21:22] what was he
[21:25] the prophet said you were only in his
[21:26] mind
[21:30] you know what the center was in his mind
[21:34] everybody in the world is in his mind
[21:41] are you going to be a respecter of
[21:42] persons well you don't understand
[21:44] predestination you just you just don't
[21:46] know
[21:47] well okay i don't know why
[21:50] i know one thing for certain
[21:53] and i don't mean this disrespectful but
[21:55] i mean it's sustainable to be the plain
[21:56] truth you come show me where i missed it
[22:00] i'll come back right here to church and
[22:02] show them that i missed it and turn
[22:03] around and tell who told it you know
[22:06] and then i'll resign and sit down
[22:11] that's how serious i am
[22:16] because if i'm wrong i'm wrong
[22:20] but if i'm right you're the one's got
[22:22] the problem
[22:24] and if i can say everything the prophet
[22:26] said
[22:27] without denying it bring me any quote on
[22:29] predestination
[22:31] that's the challenge that i put forth i
[22:33] just finished a series of of one god
[22:36] bring me anything that would show
[22:38] different than what i preached about the
[22:40] one true and living god
[22:45] oh you're just being sarcastic well come
[22:46] on
[22:49] you know that's just the best way i can
[22:50] say it
[22:53] but what do you think about
[22:54] predestination will we say well
[22:57] uh
[22:58] predestination
[23:01] god determined that i was going to be
[23:03] saved and he saved me anyway
[23:11] i want to ask you a simple question
[23:15] what may god
[23:19] turn to abraham
[23:23] and call him
[23:28] and wind up calling me him his friend
[23:34] wind up putting every one of us jew
[23:37] gentiles and whatever
[23:39] into the line and we got to talk about
[23:41] the seed of abraham
[23:46] right
[23:48] we are the children of abraham
[23:51] it don't matter where we're gentile jews
[23:52] or who we are
[23:55] all born again christians are the seed
[23:57] of abraham
[23:59] because that's the only seed that's
[24:00] worth anything
[24:02] so you know that real quick i'm not
[24:03] talking about a physical seed
[24:11] we're not all the seed of abraham by the
[24:13] natural seed
[24:15] but we're the seed of abraham by faith
[24:20] so what is god looking at
[24:23] to
[24:25] predetermine
[24:30] what is he looking at what is he judging
[24:32] it by
[24:39] well he just he loves me
[24:48] jacob have i loved he saw how i hated
[24:54] god doesn't mind using the word hate
[24:56] when it's related to esau
[24:59] but we know that god cannot use the word
[25:02] hate
[25:03] in the basis that he hates anything that
[25:05] way
[25:06] especially when it's a person or
[25:08] something
[25:10] he cannot hate what would he hate with
[25:17] the bible's full of things that are
[25:20] marvelously said
[25:23] but most of the time misunderstood
[25:28] why did god choose abraham
[25:36] it's hard to stay away from wednesday
[25:38] but i'll ask you the same question on
[25:40] david
[25:41] what made god
[25:42] come to david
[25:45] and him an adulteress and a murderer and
[25:47] all things and he said he's a man after
[25:50] my own heart
[25:57] now you tell me what he what brought him
[25:58] to him
[26:01] i'm giving you a whole layout to where
[26:03] you'll think about then we'll drop back
[26:05] the message and just shuffle through
[26:10] what do you think this is all determined
[26:12] about
[26:18] they can't be on the basis of how good
[26:20] you are
[26:26] can't be on the basis of of anything
[26:29] like there has to be a basis though for
[26:32] god to predetermine
[26:38] and it must be so simple that we can
[26:40] understand it as
[26:41] babies or children can understand
[26:45] the point of a predestination
[26:50] so what do you think about it
[26:56] all right
[26:58] predestinate
[27:01] our predestination
[27:07] means that god
[27:09] can
[27:10] predetermine
[27:15] some way
[27:20] and not be a respecter of persons
[27:25] because he wouldn't at all be saved
[27:29] right is that the bible is that the
[27:30] prophet he wouldn't all be saved
[27:37] well he just don't look at how good i am
[27:39] good for what
[27:42] what are you good for
[27:44] how much did the prophet say so many
[27:46] ounces or someone's you know
[27:48] potashes and things are worth this like
[27:51] 80 cents or something
[27:53] then
[27:54] we think we
[27:58] i'm going real slow real thoughtful
[28:00] really to get you to think and just
[28:03] i like to think things out i like to
[28:07] comprehend what is being said
[28:11] and the prophet that's why he would say
[28:13] it
[28:15] you know how he said it he said now
[28:16] predestination
[28:18] is a bad word
[28:20] to use
[28:22] in front of an untrained
[28:24] congregation now we'll read that in a
[28:26] minute you know what
[28:28] if we don't then you know it said
[28:32] why is predestination
[28:36] such a bad word
[28:43] what would make it a bad word
[28:48] it has to be on the basis of how you
[28:50] understand what the word predestination
[28:53] means
[28:55] right
[29:00] it has to be put on the point of of well
[29:03] what does predestination we baptist we
[29:05] believed in predestination
[29:09] brother dick was here he'd go with you
[29:10] with the present material they kind of
[29:12] had the idea that you know like your
[29:14] predestination was and i'm on the edge
[29:15] of the platform here and a
[29:17] step off
[29:19] well that was predestinated to happen so
[29:22] i'm glad i got it done
[29:26] now that would be a good way to approach
[29:30] the bible
[29:32] of predestination
[29:34] that some way god can predetermine
[29:39] something to take place
[29:45] but he can't put you in a pipe and push
[29:46] you through the other end of it and call
[29:49] it predestination
[29:52] he has to give you a choice
[29:59] see everybody has to have that same
[30:01] choice
[30:05] hold the difference in david and
[30:08] saul
[30:13] and see we don't even listen to the
[30:16] terminologies of the prophet and things
[30:18] to try to see we try to figure it out
[30:21] ourselves the one i love for him to talk
[30:23] about is jacob and esau
[30:30] when he said jacob have i loved and he
[30:32] saw how i hated
[30:34] and knowing that there is no part of god
[30:37] anywhere ever being ever will be to
[30:39] contin to
[30:41] deal with the word hate
[30:44] he can't hate
[30:47] he cannot like
[30:52] but he can't hate
[30:55] because that would make him a part of uh
[30:59] the world we're in
[31:01] all right
[31:04] but see you don't even think about
[31:06] listening to this
[31:10] how are you going to put
[31:12] jacob and esau in your predestination
[31:15] plan
[31:17] it's giving you little thoughts
[31:24] did not the fact after all the things
[31:28] that jacob had done to esau
[31:31] stole his birth right
[31:33] took his other things you know from him
[31:38] but after all was said and done
[31:40] [Music]
[31:44] when jacob and ease all met
[31:47] on the return of jacob from bethel
[31:52] esau
[31:54] so loved his brother until he throwed
[31:56] his arms around him
[32:02] jacob said brother he said i'll give you
[32:05] everything i've got
[32:09] natural story
[32:10] he's all looked at him he said i got
[32:13] more than what you've got
[32:15] read your bible
[32:18] i've got more than you got and then
[32:20] you're trying to give me this
[32:22] i don't want that all i want is just me
[32:25] and you to be brothers from now on
[32:29] how can you fit that in predestination
[32:33] another little illustration
[32:37] there was a lady called hagar
[32:45] and after all that happened with sarah
[32:48] and hagar and the whole story
[32:54] sarah says
[32:56] abraham this ain't working
[33:00] we can't keep her here
[33:03] because it cannot fulfill the word with
[33:05] her here
[33:07] and it's right
[33:09] so they put her out
[33:13] but what did god do
[33:17] god found her sitting under a tree
[33:21] giving her child the last drop of water
[33:23] that was there
[33:28] god said i've heard you prayers
[33:31] get up and go on back
[33:34] just be under subjection to sailor and
[33:36] do the best you can
[33:41] but yet all we read is there's nothing
[33:43] there oh man she was she was this he was
[33:46] that
[33:54] the prophet when he brings it out says
[33:56] the seed
[33:58] shall not be air with the shuck
[34:04] i remember first reading that and
[34:05] thinking this guy's messed up
[34:08] because according to our understanding
[34:11] the seed would have been right and this
[34:13] would have been they would have been
[34:14] wrong but according to the bible
[34:23] the seed shall not be aired with a shuck
[34:25] the shuck is the what
[34:27] is going into tribulation
[34:29] foolish virgins etc etc
[34:33] but they're not going to be bribed
[34:36] thank god that they can't we cannot be
[34:38] or we will not be heir with that
[34:43] god chose
[34:45] the right way
[34:47] but he gave everybody a choice and put
[34:49] it to the choice of saying okay
[34:55] how would we like it if god told us how
[34:57] we was to be predetermined
[35:06] i think he's trying to yeah
[35:09] i think he's trying to tell us how we're
[35:10] being predetermined
[35:12] if we'll listen
[35:14] all right
[35:18] see you've got to cover a lot of things
[35:20] to understand
[35:21] predestination
[35:26] but if i'm predestined to be there i'll
[35:28] be there it don't make no difference
[35:30] nothing can't change that
[35:32] you know
[35:33] but if you're predestinated to go to
[35:34] hell you're going to hang on nothing
[35:35] can't change that
[35:40] man i don't like that
[35:43] well i wasn't the one that wrote the
[35:44] book
[35:46] you're going to have to deal with god
[35:47] about his word
[35:50] you have to deal with your prophet when
[35:52] the prophet said
[35:53] god didn't pick and choose
[36:00] he didn't do it that way
[36:03] he didn't choose abraham because he was
[36:04] a good guy
[36:08] but why did he choose abraham
[36:16] all right
[36:18] let's go disappoint and then we'll get
[36:19] some of it and we'll pick up the lord
[36:21] willing wednesday
[36:24] what does predestination mean and how
[36:27] does it work
[36:30] predestination means to determine
[36:34] or predetermine something
[36:37] decide beforehand
[36:41] decree it all the way it has to be
[36:42] connected all the way back to eternity
[36:45] it has to be for ordained or appointed
[36:48] and it has to be beforehand by being
[36:50] predestination
[36:56] all right
[37:00] but which then comes first
[37:02] predestination or for knowledge
[37:06] those who did for no
[37:09] he did predestination
[37:12] so what comes first now making it simple
[37:15] to think about
[37:17] think about your predestination your
[37:19] life you're doing that and you'll come
[37:21] out with a greater understanding you
[37:23] never thought of i believe if we listen
[37:28] because everything is based then upon
[37:30] god's foreknowledge
[37:37] if he predestinated anything
[37:40] or anyone
[37:42] outside of foreknowledge first then he's
[37:45] a
[37:46] respecter of persons
[37:49] and he just messed up his whole book
[37:52] and there ain't no way that you can
[37:54] determine it what it is
[37:57] because for the same reason by the same
[38:00] reason and all it could be
[38:04] abraham
[38:08] david was chosen the same way
[38:14] solomon
[38:16] was chosen the same way
[38:22] all right
[38:24] how is it then that a person can come
[38:26] through this world
[38:30] and finish it all up
[38:32] and god can say
[38:34] to hell you go
[38:40] without a respecter
[38:42] how can you do that
[38:46] something about those individuals
[38:50] you remember i told you a few weeks ago
[38:51] i said i've been studying a lot about
[38:54] just plain naturally
[38:57] this plane naturally happened it just
[39:00] plain naturally happened that adam and
[39:02] eve wound up in the garden
[39:04] at this plane this naturally happened
[39:08] because it was real
[39:13] god never predetermined before the world
[39:16] and set back now
[39:17] i'm going to make a world
[39:20] they're going to fall
[39:22] and i'm going to save them
[39:23] no matter what they do that's
[39:26] the basics of most people's thoughts of
[39:28] predestination
[39:35] but to me every person in the world
[39:37] comes predestinated
[39:42] before knowledge
[39:46] that way i can keep the simple point of
[39:48] all people whether sinner or saint
[39:51] and leave it on a free moral agency of a
[39:54] choice that you choose what you you
[39:56] you're the one that makes you as brother
[39:58] tom falbos used to say you trigger your
[40:00] predestination
[40:02] that was a good point
[40:04] in other words you make it come into
[40:05] view by your predestination
[40:07] but what you know about predestination
[40:09] will determine what you're going to do
[40:14] but we got to understand and that was
[40:16] the reason for for doing it and taking
[40:18] it covering the godhead and all of the
[40:20] things
[40:24] and bringing that godhead to the bases
[40:26] that the eternal god before the world
[40:28] ever begun
[40:30] for knew and would predestinate and all
[40:33] like that
[40:34] because he was god
[40:36] he would be infinite
[40:39] he would he would
[40:41] know everything
[40:44] before it would ever take place if not
[40:47] you got a peanut brain god
[40:49] sorry
[40:52] because that's your peanut brain and god
[40:53] ain't messing it up
[40:58] but think about it
[41:04] predestination the prophet said
[41:07] is only the foreknowledge of god
[41:17] now if you approach predestination
[41:19] anything outside of
[41:23] it being the foreknowledge
[41:26] you are predetermining something for
[41:29] your own benefit
[41:32] your desires is involved
[41:38] god's desires was that everybody in the
[41:40] world be saved
[41:42] but by his for
[41:44] knowledge
[41:45] he knew that would never take place
[41:50] so he could write the book before the
[41:51] world
[41:56] so he could leave your name out of the
[41:57] book
[41:59] because he knows what you're going to do
[42:05] well he don't give me a choice no wait a
[42:07] minute
[42:08] there's where we got to get good and
[42:10] simple with predestination
[42:14] you got up today and you come to church
[42:17] you went through this you went through
[42:18] that some of these had to come over to
[42:20] go to this house go over to that house
[42:21] or do whatever
[42:22] you know
[42:24] you think god didn't know all about that
[42:29] are you do you think you're pulling
[42:31] anything on
[42:32] over on god
[42:36] if god knows every time a gnat bats its
[42:39] eye
[42:41] man
[42:45] and how much tyler i never didn't know
[42:47] it made tyler but
[42:49] how much
[42:51] how many times it bat its eye
[42:55] then we think and we can pull something
[42:57] over on him
[43:00] well he didn't see me do that
[43:10] to
[43:11] predetermine something even beforehand
[43:18] could only be dealt with with an eternal
[43:21] god
[43:22] who had
[43:24] you know
[43:26] all wisdom perfection and everything and
[43:30] there's no way that he could make his
[43:31] choices one way today and another way
[43:34] tomorrow
[43:35] whatever he said has to be done
[43:40] you say yeah but brother dale i had a
[43:42] choice to come to church today i could
[43:44] have went to so-and-so's church yeah but
[43:46] you didn't do it
[43:48] did you pull anything over on god
[43:53] no
[43:54] you came
[43:59] in other words
[44:00] if we determine predestination
[44:04] as to a destiny set out there is made on
[44:07] the basis of a knowledge back there
[44:11] then back there it was all finished
[44:14] he knew everybody that would ever come
[44:15] into the world he knew everybody that
[44:17] would ever be saved who would ever be
[44:19] lost
[44:26] he never made us
[44:28] wrong
[44:29] he gave us a choice
[44:33] we chose
[44:34] the wrong
[44:38] yeah but
[44:39] i i
[44:40] i i hear brother so explain that to me
[44:43] and i just i just feel so good because i
[44:46] think about what i was back there
[44:51] well let's deal with that just a minute
[44:56] you realize then in whatever you was
[44:58] back there you are now
[45:05] right
[45:07] whatever you was before the world you
[45:09] are now
[45:11] are you changed somewhere and there
[45:12] would be some change some reason or
[45:14] something
[45:18] but you just don't preach salvation
[45:20] brother dale i i believe in salvation
[45:22] that god foreknew that i'd be saved
[45:25] i agree with you
[45:27] because i agree with what the prophet
[45:29] said he said thereby he'd have it
[45:30] waiting on you and you got here
[45:33] that's his foreknowledge
[45:38] everything that happens god already knew
[45:41] it was going to happen before it would
[45:42] ever take place
[45:44] then is there any problem with jacob
[45:46] have i loved and he saw how i hated when
[45:48] he knows both ends of the scale
[45:57] but the prophet would say now god could
[45:59] not
[46:01] take and predestination is not god
[46:03] taking push us through this pipe and
[46:05] take us out the other end
[46:08] he said that can't happen
[46:12] that's god predetermining
[46:16] remember his predetermining our destiny
[46:19] determined out there is based on what he
[46:22] knew back there
[46:25] for knowledge
[46:27] for knowledge then it's very simple what
[46:28] is for knowledge the knowledge before
[46:32] is that simple enough
[46:35] knowledge before anything transpires is
[46:37] for knowledge
[46:39] now god is the only one who can do that
[46:44] right
[46:45] we can't do that
[46:49] we can pick and choose
[46:50] we can gamble we can be right half the
[46:52] time we can
[46:54] no
[46:56] he's right every time
[47:03] what i love about him is the way he
[47:04] deals
[47:08] you take cain and abel
[47:14] god says cain
[47:16] if you'd have done like your brother
[47:19] you have been accepted
[47:25] right
[47:27] but he said because you took your choice
[47:32] you made your decision you made a choice
[47:35] that you wasn't going to listen to abel
[47:37] because see i'm like this i'm sorry i
[47:40] i think
[47:41] different maybe from most people i'm
[47:43] just
[47:45] good or bad on that but i don't think
[47:47] the part in the garden with adam and
[47:50] with
[47:50] cain and abel was
[47:52] a five-minute deal
[47:56] i think they discussed life in ways and
[47:58] situations and and things and
[48:01] abel
[48:03] tried his best to explain to cain what
[48:06] took place
[48:10] and how the act was there the animal was
[48:13] there the things were there the things
[48:15] took place all of this had to happen
[48:17] he was trying to explain that
[48:21] to cain
[48:24] and cain
[48:26] like you and i
[48:28] i don't like that idea
[48:30] oh you're making it too
[48:32] er you know i mean we don't want our
[48:34] children to hear these things
[48:38] you're making it too plain to talk about
[48:40] an animal and a woman a bit together
[48:42] you're making that too plain
[48:46] well i thought that's what they're
[48:47] teaching in school now i didn't know
[48:51] they call it sex education
[48:53] i guess that makes it right
[48:58] but listen
[49:03] would cain have been accepted
[49:06] had he done right
[49:11] no god was just playing with him
[49:14] um
[49:17] he wasn't playing with it he's telling
[49:18] the truth
[49:21] and he walked back over there and said
[49:23] abel
[49:24] i don't understand this
[49:27] i'm serious i don't understand what all
[49:29] you told me
[49:30] but said don't stop telling me because i
[49:32] know one thing for sure god's over on
[49:34] your side
[49:37] at that time he had not made the choices
[49:38] and done it but he
[49:41] cain had enough sense to know that god
[49:42] was already on the side of abel
[49:45] because he was trying to why would god
[49:47] tell cain
[49:48] cain if you will do what's right
[49:55] you understand what i'm talking about i
[49:57] like to look at things over a long scale
[49:59] i don't believe even the beast and all
[50:01] this and the other was a five minute of
[50:03] fire
[50:05] i believe it was months weeks years
[50:09] time
[50:11] involved
[50:14] to bring it to a finality
[50:18] of things taking place
[50:21] and then doing every bit of that you see
[50:23] then that he made her choice
[50:29] and god according to what he knew before
[50:31] the world
[50:33] knew that choice that she was going to
[50:35] make
[50:39] what i love about him was he didn't kill
[50:41] eve right there
[50:44] even though she'd made the wrong choice
[50:48] he said i'll still put up with it
[50:52] even though i've got a foreknowledge
[50:54] that has determined within me that i
[50:56] know what you're going to do
[50:58] i'm still going to do the best i can
[51:02] don't you think god foreknew everything
[51:06] if you don't what's wrong what kind of a
[51:08] god do you have what kind of an idea or
[51:11] point
[51:16] what would make you think that god
[51:18] doesn't know everything
[51:22] so then what did he do
[51:24] that was what i was telling you about it
[51:27] a little bit
[51:31] this bible is full of
[51:35] things that took place
[51:40] and those things taking place
[51:46] was not
[51:48] haphazards but it was
[51:53] the fact that something took place
[51:56] there was a garden of eden
[52:00] there was an adam and eve
[52:04] there was a natural cane and abel
[52:07] there was a natural
[52:09] abraham
[52:12] there was a natural
[52:13] david
[52:16] those things are natural
[52:18] it's it's a record
[52:21] this bible is a record of mankind
[52:24] upon the earth
[52:26] it tells the beginning of mankind it
[52:28] tells what he goes through and all of
[52:29] his doing and his choosing and it tells
[52:31] the end of mankind
[52:39] and you see all we got to do is read it
[52:42] you like to read a love story
[52:46] now come on i know you do it but i
[52:49] i know a lot of women especially i like
[52:51] reading love story books
[52:53] well let me give you one to a sign for
[52:55] you to read
[52:57] turn to the songs of solomon and read
[52:59] that this afternoon
[53:01] the greatest love story that's ever been
[53:03] in life until the fact is that mankind
[53:06] still wonders
[53:07] my brother will tell you in a heartbeat
[53:10] that that was
[53:12] solomon's lust
[53:16] that caused that problem
[53:19] well i've got to admit solomon's
[53:20] involved
[53:22] but i told him i said no you can't put
[53:25] it that way
[53:27] because you're making god force
[53:29] something to take place you're putting
[53:30] the desires into mankind
[53:34] well i've heard them in this message say
[53:35] that god put the desires into the women
[53:38] to do what they've done and they've done
[53:39] it
[53:41] well that's getting very close
[53:47] but think about it
[53:51] predestination is the prophet says it on
[53:54] the questions and answers number two if
[53:56] you want to pull it up where they can
[53:57] read it
[53:59] predestination is only the foreknowledge
[54:03] of god
[54:06] [Music]
[54:10] with the foreknowledge
[54:14] all right
[54:16] god being infinite
[54:19] before knowledge he knew everything
[54:22] or he isn't infinite see
[54:25] he knew what would happen
[54:27] so by for knowledge he could
[54:29] predestinate
[54:31] that's the reason that i believe that
[54:34] god's
[54:35] that god just doesn't you know
[54:38] what's he doing
[54:40] predestination
[54:45] go to the next one
[54:50] number three
[54:52] taken from faith of abraham
[54:56] and predestination is a hard word to use
[54:58] among accommodation people you know
[55:02] really foreknowledge is a better word
[55:04] and predestination looks back to
[55:06] foreknowledge
[55:08] and foreknowledge looks on to destiny
[55:11] all right
[55:13] now that that's an odd situation
[55:17] did you read what he said he says
[55:21] really foreknowledge is a better word
[55:22] predestination looks back to
[55:24] foreknowledge
[55:26] and foreknowledge looks owned to the
[55:28] destiny
[55:30] well
[55:31] it goes all the way back
[55:33] and before the world god wrote the book
[55:37] of the destiny
[55:39] he didn't have to wait until this would
[55:41] touch fire we know he didn't have to
[55:42] write
[55:43] this is the book that
[55:46] your bible is the book that was written
[55:48] by mankind to cover the world in time
[55:55] destiny god being infinite
[55:59] knew the end from the beginning
[56:00] therefore he knew what people would do
[56:03] so he could foretell
[56:05] what would take place for he knew what
[56:08] would be therefore he before esau or
[56:11] jacob either one was born god could say
[56:14] esau i've hated and jacob i've loved
[56:19] why because he foreknew what they could
[56:23] be
[56:24] he never made he saw the way he was
[56:27] he wasn't willing that esau would be
[56:30] that way but he saw by choice
[56:34] god knew would take that way
[56:38] so that's how he knows us today
[56:41] he knows your heart
[56:43] and if you might be able to fool your
[56:45] neighbor you might be able to fool your
[56:47] pastor
[56:49] but you'll never be able to fool god
[56:52] because he knows your heart
[56:54] therefore he
[56:56] by election
[56:58] he chose abraham
[56:59] for he knew what abraham would
[57:03] do
[57:06] now there's the key to understanding
[57:08] what we're going to be talking about
[57:09] wednesday night
[57:13] keep that key
[57:14] that he knew what abraham
[57:17] would
[57:18] do
[57:21] why
[57:23] because according to his foreign
[57:26] is that simple enough
[57:28] according to god's foreknowledge he saw
[57:29] what abraham would do he saw what you
[57:31] would do
[57:33] is that simple enough
[57:37] all right
[57:40] you remember when he called him out
[57:42] there and said
[57:44] he not keep the thing a secret from him
[57:48] when he was going down to destroy sodom
[57:49] and gomorrah he said for i know that
[57:52] abraham will teach his children
[57:57] i know that
[58:00] god's himself
[58:03] let me turn that around where i can put
[58:04] it to her
[58:06] david coming forth
[58:08] and god knows what david will do
[58:12] god
[58:13] knows david will teach his children
[58:17] i know god's
[58:19] himself
[58:20] how that god or abraham will send this
[58:24] message on down from one to the other
[58:27] the generation put david in there
[58:30] because the same thing that motivated
[58:32] david motivated abraham
[58:35] the same thing motivated god where he
[58:38] would not be making a choice
[58:43] god doesn't choose
[58:45] the way we think
[58:48] you say he chose me that's right
[58:50] the better way of saying it i was chosen
[58:52] in him
[58:54] there's a better way of saying it
[58:55] instead of saying god chose you
[58:57] better way of saying it is god chose you
[58:59] in him
[59:02] because that way then you don't have to
[59:03] leave it look
[59:04] but god for knowing that and knowing
[59:07] that abraham would do it then he told
[59:10] abraham
[59:12] in the beginning
[59:14] that he would save him and save his seed
[59:16] after him
[59:21] and would give him the unconditional
[59:23] covenant
[59:24] that he made with abraham
[59:27] not because abraham was good
[59:30] because god was good
[59:35] if god ever is this a quote from the
[59:36] prophet that would fit anywhere you
[59:38] wanted if god ever gives you a promise
[59:40] you can go to the bank with it
[59:44] don't ever promise you
[59:46] something you don't have to worry about
[59:47] it
[59:48] right you don't have to try to figure it
[59:50] out
[59:52] the thing to do is just go say it
[1:00:02] this is one i like we'll get to it later
[1:00:07] abraham believed god
[1:00:10] and it was imputed unto him for
[1:00:14] righteousness
[1:00:18] so whatever abraham needed
[1:00:21] it was imputed
[1:00:23] why because he believed god
[1:00:26] that's the key to wednesday night
[1:00:28] abraham or anybody believe in god see
[1:00:31] that's why some people can't believe god
[1:00:36] they just can't believe it they just
[1:00:37] won't do it because they won't listen
[1:00:40] they won't listen to the simplicity of
[1:00:42] god in him trying to deal with them
[1:00:45] all god says to abram which he wouldn't
[1:00:47] even abraham he said abram
[1:00:49] come follow me
[1:00:54] now you think god didn't know that
[1:00:57] do you think when jesus was walking the
[1:00:59] shores of galilee that he looked at the
[1:01:01] disciples and he says come follow me
[1:01:04] they just laid down their stuff and
[1:01:06] started walking his way
[1:01:08] right
[1:01:12] why didn't everybody else do that that's
[1:01:13] right
[1:01:15] everybody else could look around and say
[1:01:17] well we want to be there when the breads
[1:01:18] and loaves is passed out
[1:01:20] you know
[1:01:24] but the disciples just laid ever i think
[1:01:26] about that something took place
[1:01:29] in a situation
[1:01:32] that you can put it with abraham
[1:01:34] isaac jacob joseph come on down david
[1:01:38] solomon you can just keep coming right
[1:01:40] on down coming into the disciples to
[1:01:43] come right on down to where you are
[1:01:45] something triggered that
[1:01:47] something made that take place
[1:01:53] but you know what
[1:01:58] it was going to take place
[1:02:00] because god saw it i want to end it with
[1:02:03] that
[1:02:04] part god saw
[1:02:10] what abraham would do
[1:02:16] all right
[1:02:16] he didn't make him then do or not do
[1:02:23] he left him with a choice
[1:02:26] and abraham took the right choice and
[1:02:28] made it right what if he took the wrong
[1:02:29] choice
[1:02:31] like i've always said about the virgin
[1:02:32] mary
[1:02:35] she said be it unto me according to thy
[1:02:36] word well how many other women in that
[1:02:38] day
[1:02:39] did god now you can say this going to be
[1:02:41] presuming brother they'll be okay we'll
[1:02:43] just presume a little bit but get the
[1:02:45] point across
[1:02:47] how many young virgins in that day read
[1:02:49] the bible and said
[1:02:52] i could be that girl
[1:02:56] he said no no no no
[1:02:58] why not
[1:03:00] see you're putting it in a pot and
[1:03:01] pushing it here you're making everything
[1:03:03] work
[1:03:04] instead of leaving it to the bases that
[1:03:06] god could sit back before the world in
[1:03:09] his foreknowledge and look all the way
[1:03:11] down through time
[1:03:13] and everything
[1:03:18] would be predetermined
[1:03:20] how many times that gnat batted his eye
[1:03:24] why would it be predetermined because
[1:03:25] god saw that's what it would do
[1:03:30] yeah but you're putting it
[1:03:32] you're putting our salvation on the
[1:03:34] basis of something we do or don't do
[1:03:40] where did you get that idea
[1:03:46] he said well it's not on what i do or
[1:03:48] don't do
[1:03:51] well is it on what you don't do
[1:03:56] are you saved because you don't do
[1:04:03] no
[1:04:06] you're saved by grace through faith
[1:04:14] what was god looking at with abel
[1:04:21] the same way he looked at it in abraham
[1:04:29] does the bible say
[1:04:33] what i just quoted a moment ago
[1:04:35] that abraham believed god
[1:04:39] and it was imputed unto him for
[1:04:40] righteousness is that the scripture
[1:04:47] well you know what can't you say
[1:04:54] why can't you be sent so long
[1:04:58] and say uh
[1:05:01] you know
[1:05:03] god looked down and seen what i would do
[1:05:08] and he seen that i would choose him
[1:05:10] that's my savior
[1:05:13] yeah but that's making it on what we do
[1:05:15] no
[1:05:19] that's making it on the choice we make
[1:05:24] it's making it on to the decisions that
[1:05:25] we make
[1:05:27] the decisions that we make
[1:05:28] is involved in our predestination
[1:05:30] because
[1:05:32] if i made that decision i decided to be
[1:05:35] at church today you know when i made
[1:05:36] that decision
[1:05:38] god saw it before the world ever begun
[1:05:41] god saw you'd be sitting here
[1:05:45] all right now listen
[1:05:47] he knew what you'd think
[1:05:51] right
[1:05:53] you know when you think it before the
[1:05:54] world
[1:05:55] now you can't change that thought so
[1:05:56] there ain't no need to do anything the
[1:05:58] best thing to do just repent
[1:06:01] oh well brother dale i didn't sin that's
[1:06:04] the worst sin of all is to doubt god
[1:06:06] that is the only sin
[1:06:09] the only sin there is is us to doubt god
[1:06:11] to doubt that god could before the world
[1:06:13] sat down and looked all the way through
[1:06:15] time and go all the way through and
[1:06:17] predestinate every gnat that would ever
[1:06:19] appear there and come into six thousand
[1:06:22] years of time and go through a
[1:06:24] millennium to put another thousand in
[1:06:26] and all of that how many times i don't
[1:06:28] know you know
[1:06:30] and that god knew before the world how
[1:06:32] many times he'd do it right
[1:06:37] but what if the nat decided one day he
[1:06:39] didn't want to bat his eye
[1:06:43] he said well he can't do that when god
[1:06:45] knew he was going to do that
[1:06:48] come on god knew that that decided we
[1:06:51] were going to decide somewhere in town
[1:06:52] not as bad as i was right
[1:06:54] come on i'm trying to get you to see the
[1:06:56] infinite god and his great wisdom
[1:07:00] we ain't pulling nothing over on him
[1:07:05] he knew what we would do he knew where
[1:07:08] we would be today and what's going on
[1:07:10] today
[1:07:12] well i just
[1:07:14] i just decided to go to church today
[1:07:19] well
[1:07:21] i'm going to say it to you and just put
[1:07:23] it in plain language
[1:07:25] david never got up and decided to go to
[1:07:27] church
[1:07:36] he said
[1:07:38] let's go up
[1:07:39] you know it's a very little incline
[1:07:41] been there and walked up to it's not a
[1:07:43] great big old ditch great big hills and
[1:07:45] mountains it's just a little incline
[1:07:47] comes up and you leave from where david
[1:07:49] was down here with his temple and to be
[1:07:51] made you know in his house and live it
[1:07:53] and you walk up
[1:07:55] and then you level off and there's where
[1:07:56] the temple was at
[1:07:59] david said
[1:08:01] let's go up to the house of the lord
[1:08:05] well let's go this way david no that
[1:08:06] ain't the way they are
[1:08:09] yeah we made these houses to our god
[1:08:12] we made these and you
[1:08:14] solomon would be involved in it not much
[1:08:16] david but solomon
[1:08:19] would be so much until he built houses
[1:08:21] for the prostitutes or the the uh
[1:08:25] uh common women
[1:08:29] right
[1:08:30] he built big old buildings for him
[1:08:32] temples and things
[1:08:34] well that wasn't going up to the house
[1:08:35] of the of the lord
[1:08:39] now david had a reason let's go up to
[1:08:41] the house
[1:08:42] god knew before the world that there was
[1:08:44] david was going to go
[1:08:46] right up
[1:08:47] and he knew even saul
[1:08:50] would turn the way he'd do it he even
[1:08:52] now listen even you
[1:08:57] how you would turn out
[1:08:59] and which side of this road you're going
[1:09:02] and what you're deciding
[1:09:04] see you're deciding right now
[1:09:07] your decisions has been made in your
[1:09:09] mind of whether or not the god that
[1:09:11] brother dale's talking about is god or
[1:09:12] do we need to search for another one
[1:09:16] because if you don't agree with what the
[1:09:18] way has been said then you need to
[1:09:19] search for one that you can find and
[1:09:21] agree with
[1:09:22] that's no problem
[1:09:25] but remember you got a choice
[1:09:29] okay
[1:09:33] he knew who would be saved
[1:09:35] and who would not be saved
[1:09:46] predestination looks back
[1:09:49] to foreknowledge
[1:09:51] for knowledge
[1:09:52] in return can look all the way
[1:09:55] to the end of your destiny
[1:10:00] you know what
[1:10:02] from there to there now you're gonna
[1:10:05] kick on me hard so let's go ahead
[1:10:09] from the beginning of my journey in life
[1:10:11] as
[1:10:12] a human being and
[1:10:14] coming up i can remember
[1:10:16] things happening
[1:10:18] you've heard me tell other you've heard
[1:10:19] the prophet tell the things that
[1:10:21] sometimes in your life was a little bit
[1:10:22] different from everybody else
[1:10:24] you've heard me tell of the fact of
[1:10:25] going out and doing wrong and come home
[1:10:27] and just say well what in the world did
[1:10:28] i do something like that for
[1:10:34] and i'd wind up you know really
[1:10:36] repenting for life
[1:10:39] you know
[1:10:40] but you see
[1:10:42] he knew all he had to do
[1:10:46] was to cross my path
[1:10:49] all right we could walk in the baptists
[1:10:52] we had fellowship i'm talking about me
[1:10:54] and god
[1:10:55] we had fellowship
[1:10:58] but one day a man walked up to me and he
[1:11:00] says
[1:11:01] what do you believe about the godhead
[1:11:06] i said one true and living god
[1:11:09] jesus is his name that's baptist
[1:11:11] doctrine
[1:11:16] he said explain that i said well the
[1:11:18] best thing i can tell you is god in
[1:11:19] three persons blessed trinity
[1:11:22] he said you're a trinitarian you're just
[1:11:23] as much as anybody else a trinitarian i
[1:11:25] looked at him i said i don't believe
[1:11:27] that no more
[1:11:30] now you think god didn't know before the
[1:11:32] world what it would take to cross
[1:11:36] the path
[1:11:40] see
[1:11:40] i couldn't come up under
[1:11:42] uh robert tatum coming and visiting me i
[1:11:45] loved him his wonderful brother
[1:11:47] i couldn't come up under you know
[1:11:50] uh george canada coming there's people
[1:11:52] you know
[1:11:55] see i had to meet that one that had the
[1:11:57] word
[1:12:01] and many of the others didn't have it i
[1:12:02] didn't say that now you get your mind
[1:12:05] straight
[1:12:06] i'm trying to express it god knew who it
[1:12:09] would take
[1:12:11] god knows who's going to take across
[1:12:13] your path
[1:12:19] and he knows if you turn that down
[1:12:23] you're making the wrong choice
[1:12:25] right
[1:12:27] because you're changing your destiny
[1:12:33] from foreknowledge
[1:12:34] to just plain destiny
[1:12:37] god chose me and i'm going to make it
[1:12:40] you know
[1:12:41] before the world ever begun
[1:12:44] he chose jesus christ
[1:12:48] by choosing him all i got to do is make
[1:12:51] sure that i've got the right choice in
[1:12:52] choosing them for my savior
[1:12:56] because
[1:12:58] that's where it's all involved
[1:13:01] he chose me in jesus christ
[1:13:07] you think i'm on fail no
[1:13:09] so he could predestinate my journey he
[1:13:12] could look down and say well all i got
[1:13:13] to do one of these days is walk across
[1:13:16] his path and drop a little word and
[1:13:18] he'll just come running
[1:13:25] how many of you remember when you first
[1:13:27] heard of the word
[1:13:30] if you understand what i'm saying i'm
[1:13:31] just trying to make it plain
[1:13:33] those disciples when jesus walked down
[1:13:35] through there
[1:13:37] they had never seen him they didn't know
[1:13:38] anything about what's going on he turned
[1:13:40] around and looked at him and come on
[1:13:41] follow me
[1:13:44] what we're going to do peter no no we're
[1:13:46] going to follow him
[1:13:48] yeah who's he well they claim he's a
[1:13:50] messiah so let's go find out
[1:13:55] you think god didn't know that's what's
[1:13:57] going to happen
[1:13:58] you think he don't know what it needs to
[1:13:59] take and touch you
[1:14:05] you mean you believe in a personal god
[1:14:07] that much brother dale i certainly do
[1:14:10] i believe brother when you walked up
[1:14:11] there and accepted jesus christ as your
[1:14:13] savior that before the world that was a
[1:14:16] choice
[1:14:18] that you made
[1:14:20] it took 6 000 years to get here
[1:14:24] and two seconds to transpire
[1:14:28] right
[1:14:30] and you say well well
[1:14:32] you know
[1:14:34] was i always a christian
[1:14:38] you know was always a christian
[1:14:41] no
[1:14:43] no you weren't always a christian
[1:14:44] there's no such thing we don't agree
[1:14:46] with that right
[1:14:47] but she was always
[1:14:50] the seed
[1:14:54] it was just waiting for a place to land
[1:14:58] seed landed in a little woman one day
[1:15:00] and she said be it unto me according to
[1:15:02] thy word
[1:15:03] brought jesus christ into the world
[1:15:06] a seed dropped in a seed we're talking
[1:15:08] about the word of god we ain't talking
[1:15:09] about some bean or corn or something
[1:15:13] god knew before the foundation world all
[1:15:14] he had to do was just cross your path
[1:15:18] i had another message to put in what i
[1:15:20] was bringing on the other series and i
[1:15:22] decided to drop out
[1:15:24] you know that brother branham says
[1:15:26] the only way
[1:15:28] that jesus
[1:15:29] could be the father was to be the son of
[1:15:32] man
[1:15:36] you know it just throws your mind every
[1:15:38] which way done
[1:15:39] but he said the only way he could be a
[1:15:41] father
[1:15:42] was to be the son of man
[1:15:44] you know why because the son of man is
[1:15:45] the sower of the seed that's right
[1:15:48] the son of man was the
[1:15:50] i am that was in the garden
[1:15:53] the son of man come all the way down
[1:15:56] just watching us and just directing us
[1:15:58] and just turning us and
[1:16:00] you know he said well i supposed to go
[1:16:01] here you ever you ever went down the
[1:16:03] road
[1:16:04] and you get somewhere and you say well
[1:16:06] why did i turn that away
[1:16:09] when you turn the radio on and they say
[1:16:11] there was a big
[1:16:13] wreck there
[1:16:16] see he turned you away
[1:16:18] he dropped the seed you took it and went
[1:16:20] on with it
[1:16:21] why can't we believe it as our christian
[1:16:23] journey
[1:16:28] think about your christian journey what
[1:16:29] you've done where you come from and what
[1:16:31] you're doing and how you first heard the
[1:16:33] word
[1:16:39] when you first said
[1:16:40] i believe that
[1:16:46] i believe that
[1:16:50] thank you lord for crossing my path
[1:16:53] and just dropping a seed that i could
[1:16:55] come forth
[1:16:55] [Applause]
[1:16:57] and be what you want me to be
[1:17:02] come find out you might have something
[1:17:03] to do with your salvation if you occur
[1:17:06] you'll understand correctly
[1:17:08] not to face point of not the point of
[1:17:10] dying or paying the price or this out of
[1:17:13] the other but you know what we missed
[1:17:16] the point i think of thinking about
[1:17:19] you had to accept
[1:17:22] jesus christ is your savior
[1:17:25] or you will not be saved
[1:17:32] brother dale you you're kind of putting
[1:17:33] it like that i've got a little bit to do
[1:17:35] with it
[1:17:36] well
[1:17:37] you put it some other way
[1:17:40] something to do with yourself no you
[1:17:42] didn't pay the price you didn't die on
[1:17:43] the cross you didn't do all of those
[1:17:44] things no
[1:17:47] but you accepted what he done
[1:17:52] he said lord i don't understand it i
[1:17:54] don't know what's going on
[1:17:56] i remember when i walked out of the
[1:17:57] baptist church because i was a baptist
[1:17:59] deacon
[1:18:00] for i forgot how long darren i was 25
[1:18:02] years old when or 23 i guess when i
[1:18:05] first ordained a baptist deacon which
[1:18:07] that was taboo you know because you had
[1:18:08] to be 40 before you become one
[1:18:11] that's just stating the fact of
[1:18:13] coming from the baptist that there was
[1:18:15] they saw what was there and they put me
[1:18:17] in the office
[1:18:19] as a deacon
[1:18:21] i'd done the best i could do and
[1:18:22] everything and then one day when i was
[1:18:24] like brother across my path
[1:18:27] when he crossed my path when he said
[1:18:29] that and i said i don't believe that no
[1:18:30] more you know what i was saying
[1:18:32] i can't go back
[1:18:36] i was literally saying
[1:18:39] the day he said that to me and i said
[1:18:42] i don't believe that no more
[1:18:44] i knew one thing for certain
[1:18:47] my baptism was number one yes
[1:18:51] that was the priority for right there i
[1:18:52] had to do and by knowing the baptist
[1:18:55] doctrine
[1:18:57] you can be you can go from a methodist
[1:18:59] to a baptist you can go this out the
[1:19:00] other you don't have to but if you go to
[1:19:02] a baptist church you're going to be
[1:19:04] baptized in that church
[1:19:07] that is the rule
[1:19:09] you will not be accepted as a full
[1:19:11] member
[1:19:12] unless you go get baptized even though
[1:19:14] you've done been baptized five times in
[1:19:16] father's run holy ghost or whatever you
[1:19:17] want to do you're going to get baptized
[1:19:19] in the baptist church
[1:19:21] see because that's rules all right see i
[1:19:23] knew that day
[1:19:24] that i was out of that church
[1:19:28] just by simply saying
[1:19:30] i believe god's word
[1:19:33] i knew i was leaving that was i was done
[1:19:35] there
[1:19:37] i went home i didn't tell my wife i
[1:19:38] didn't discuss it with her anything
[1:19:41] because i wanted her to make up her mind
[1:19:42] you'd say well this foolish maybe it was
[1:19:46] i didn't tell her when we went to the
[1:19:48] church that day
[1:19:49] and i was teaching
[1:19:50] i had about five jobs
[1:19:53] and i had to stand up and resign from
[1:19:54] all of them because of the things i was
[1:19:56] sunday school superintendent i was this
[1:19:58] at the other side being a deacon
[1:20:00] and i didn't tell her that i was leaving
[1:20:03] i got up and i said i've got to go
[1:20:07] because i can't stay here
[1:20:12] that was the statement i've got to go
[1:20:14] my brother come out
[1:20:16] you say well he didn't mean it well he
[1:20:18] would have probably he said we'll build
[1:20:20] you a church if that's what you want
[1:20:22] i said that ain't what it is
[1:20:26] i said i've got to go where the words at
[1:20:29] right
[1:20:30] my choice has been on the word i've got
[1:20:32] to go with the word because the word is
[1:20:34] spoken in my heart
[1:20:38] i don't have a bad name of being a
[1:20:40] church breakers and all this at the
[1:20:42] other in the city of lula i'm in city of
[1:20:44] guildsville or lula
[1:20:46] i think they would respect us
[1:20:48] because we've never just been an
[1:20:50] outlandish least saying you know
[1:20:52] we've always tried to be a christian
[1:20:55] the people here have always tried to
[1:20:56] serve christ
[1:20:58] and be a christian
[1:21:00] it would be well thought of
[1:21:02] what are you what are you saying i'm
[1:21:04] saying this way
[1:21:06] has he ever crossed your path
[1:21:10] and just dropped a little seed into your
[1:21:12] heart
[1:21:13] of the word
[1:21:17] because that was where i was at
[1:21:20] i walked out of that church that day
[1:21:22] knowing
[1:21:23] not where i was going
[1:21:28] but knowing
[1:21:29] that there was a god that would speak
[1:21:32] because you see i had met him before in
[1:21:34] my christian journey as little things
[1:21:41] but that day i made up my mind
[1:21:44] i go with the word
[1:21:46] i went home got down to no barbecue pit
[1:21:48] we had in the backyard and started
[1:21:50] crying and praying
[1:21:53] because i knew i was
[1:21:54] done i knew the rules i was the guy that
[1:21:57] was in the rule book i was the guy that
[1:21:59] was a baptist that was on the board
[1:22:01] you know
[1:22:03] and i knew i couldn't go back
[1:22:08] i said god have i foolishly messed up
[1:22:11] everything
[1:22:12] now i can't even go back there
[1:22:16] well he just took me one day at a time
[1:22:21] he's been walking with me one day at a
[1:22:23] time and that's what i've accepted
[1:22:24] that's what i'm trying to get you to see
[1:22:26] a reality of a living god
[1:22:30] if you think of anything as
[1:22:31] predestination just remember
[1:22:34] the god you're thinking about before the
[1:22:36] world knew what you would do and he
[1:22:38] would determine that end you can't
[1:22:40] change now listen to what i'm saying
[1:22:42] you say well can i change my
[1:22:44] predestination why would you want to
[1:22:52] you don't listen to your prophet
[1:22:56] the prophet said with the spirit that i
[1:22:58] have now i like that part
[1:23:00] he said
[1:23:02] if he wants to throw me into hell i want
[1:23:04] to go
[1:23:06] because i want to serve him
[1:23:09] is that right
[1:23:10] is that the way maybe a little different
[1:23:12] wording or whatever but it's what he
[1:23:13] said
[1:23:15] see he loved god
[1:23:17] do you love god enough to know that i
[1:23:19] may have to give up this that or the
[1:23:21] others all kind of things to be able to
[1:23:23] serve god
[1:23:26] let's stand come on musician
[1:23:30] think on these things
[1:23:34] predestination is
[1:23:37] the fact that god foreknew
[1:23:41] what you would do not that what he would
[1:23:44] make you do
[1:23:46] that's not predestination predestination
[1:23:49] is the fact of stating something is
[1:23:50] happening because he knows you're going
[1:23:52] to do it
[1:23:55] well
[1:23:56] if he's been with us all these years
[1:23:59] you think i worry about something see
[1:24:01] this this stuff i've tried to tell you
[1:24:02] this stuff with the viruses and things
[1:24:05] that's not nothing that's uh
[1:24:07] oh yeah it's bad it's hate it's a
[1:24:09] horrible thing
[1:24:11] but we're not in no tribulation or
[1:24:13] nothing
[1:24:16] we're doing mighty good living good and
[1:24:18] eating good and
[1:24:21] ain't no tribulation
[1:24:23] that's just tribulation that working
[1:24:25] patience
[1:24:28] see things are going to get rough
[1:24:32] then it'll be a decision to see whether
[1:24:34] or not you've got it
[1:24:36] it'll be there to side then on what do
[1:24:38] we got brother
