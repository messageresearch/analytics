========================================

good morning everyone good morning teacher morning I forgot let's turn back to Genesis 5 that's the butt you cut his head off at least show part of his head comp comparing this the the book of the generations of Adam was the book of the generations of Jesus Christ and uh just to finish up this chapter um we talked about how this is the chapter of of testifies that Adam sold us into death and Jesus redeems us um and just one last thing in this chapter is that that uh we're kind of going to get into numbers a little bit upside down your micophone she had a friend I have a friend that that's good um so how many uh how many how many generations are here are um wait a second we need to pause for a second cuz I need to Craig something I said last time hey man wait waiting on that uh y'all will believe what happened but he's going to tell you and I'll tell you the other part of it the other part yeah so last time I I I made a comment that that nobody had lived longer than it was Methuselah and then Adam which is incorrect I got I got my numbers all messed up it's methusa and Jared the father of lamec and then Noah 950 years and then Adam right but we go to Joseph's house and play Bible trivia and you want to believe that was a Bible trivia question he asked me so and I said Adam cuz you said it today he turned it over and it said generous Bob's face goes red who I said well it's all over the world now H I thought you did so I got that wrong I still won I still won the whole game that so that was unfortunate for the way but that you know I believe but no I believe it was the Lord I really believe it was the Lord did that really I mean how would you come up with a there's a there's a box of a thousand questions in that one question was asked who was the second oldest from medland right and you had just covered it that more so Lord I mean Lord C I want I want to be real careful because the whole word is a tapestry and if you mess up one thing it can offset everything else so it it's important to be sure is extremely care that's right um so we're looking at Genesis CH 5 how many how many Generations are here if you count them all up you get uh Noah's the last generation and then he had three sons ham shim and Je ja all the names the listed in Genesis 5 are 13 and um brother random talked about the number 13 represents that's the number of a woman worship of a woman and uh if you look at ew bullinger's book on the numbers in scripture he talks about how the number represents Rebellion from God's word apostasy corruption so uh Genesis 5 is what what because of Adam and Eve took upon sin in the garden and rebelled against God's word we were sold into death and um that's that's actually where number 13 God is unlucky uh people treat as unlucky because um let's just take a second to look at that in scripture genes let's go to Genesis 14:4 because 12 years they served ched om and in the 13th year they were bailed and remember ched om took uh lot captive and went and uh brought him back so in the 13th year they were bailed in Genesis 177 25 Genesis 7825 and Ishmael his son was 13 years old when he was circumcised in the fles of his poor Skin So Isel was circumcised when he was 13 and then uh went away let see Jeremiah 253 Jeremiah 25 3 chap the third verse the word that came to let's start at verse first the word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the people of Judah and the fourth year of je son of Josiah king of Judah that was the first year of nebuchad RAR king of Babylon the which Jeremiah the Prophet spake unto all the people of Judah and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem saying from the 13th year of Josiah the son of am and king of to even unto this day that is the 3 and 20th year the word of the Lord have come unto me and I have spoke unto you Rising early and speaking but ye have not hearkened 13 here spoke so number 13 kind of signifies reion against God's word and and compare that with what brother R said about the worship of a woman that America's number is 13 uh we got 13 strikes 13 stars so uh Genesis 5 is is a death Adam was a witness live 930 years and then we move over to um Matthew I'm sorry what's the number 13 signify Rebellion uh worship of a woman uh apostasy uh rebelling against God's word everything everything that the United States is do yes right for the character yes exactly Matthew 1 chapter one these fans are going speak up a little hour I don't have that problem but you probably do and I still hav't got my voice back quite now uh 13 Matthew verse one the book of the generations of Jesus Christ the son of David the son of Abraham now uh I have a lot of stuff I need to put together see all bear with me but the theme of this is that uh last time we talked about how the the ladder uh Jacob's Ladder was Anchored In Jesus Christ and um you can't anchor it in a man you got to Anchor It In Christ and uh if we're in Christ that's how that's how we Ascend the ladder back to Heaven Is by being in Christ being part of him and the whole uh uh the genealogy in Matthew and the genealogy and Luke speak to the promises that were made all down through the Old Testament of the one that was going to come to redeem us to take us back to what Adam lost right let's see this so we talked uh briefly a couple of weeks ago about how um I'm missing some notes I have that's all right U about how uh Matthew is presents presents him as the son of David and um so the theme of this is that where we're going to start off sorry here we go although it list has Offspring gen uh the the genealogy Jesus is not the physical offspring of Adam cuz you can't anchor that the ladder in him so let's turn uh we're the the topic is Matthew and Luke but let's turn to Matthew the 22nd chapter verse 41 now this is this confused the Pharisees because they were looking for somebody they they always they claim to Salvation was their their genealogy I they said they were the the children of Abraham so uh this is this is a familiar scripture to us all and uh verse one while the Pharisees were gathered together Jesus asked him saying what think you of Christ whose son is he they say unto him the son of David he saith unto them how then do David in spirit call him Lord saying the Lord said unto my Lord sit thou on my right hand till I make thine enemies thy foot stol if David didn't call him Lord how is he his son and no man was able to answer him any word answer in my word neither D any man from that day forth ask him any more questions and think about that lad the Lord said unto my Lord the is the root and The Offspring so what Jesus is testifying is they uh this uh this the son of David began before David he's the root of him and he's The Offspring he's the author and finisher of our faith he's the beginning and the end and not just not just in you know how brother said Alpha and Omega not just the beginning but he's manifested his attributes all down through Through the Ages not just in the beginning or the end and then uh this was a very important part of Peter's Pentecostal message let's go to Acts 2 32 acts 2:32 this Jesus hath God raised up whereof we all are witnesses therefore being by the right hand of God exalted and having received of the Father the promise of the Holy Ghost he hath shed forth this which you now see and hear for David is not ascended into the heavens but he saith himself the Lord said unto my Lord sit down on my right hand until I make thy f FES that foot St therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly that God have made that same Jesus whom he have crucified both the Lord and Christ like David he wor he he uh he sacrificed heers goat sheep he he was under the blood of of sheep and goats looking forward to that day when Jesus blood could allow him to uh to to make it into heaven let bre that that lad like brother R said um David couldn't go go up he was under the shed blood of heers and goats and sheep but now he could raise he was under the blood of the Lord Jesus they only answered to that blood when it were coming Force when the blood of Christ come in force for all those who had died in Good favor Rose that's right and ascended into Glory because they rose with him after his his uh death or Resurrection um so let's look um ma The Book of Matthew after we talked about after 400 years of no prophets Malachi was the last prophet in the Book of Matthew uh was written and the Book of Matthew is is peculiar because it's the 40th book in the Bible and just to show you how perfect even the order of the books is is absolutely perfect to show to show God to manifest God's Will and uh to manifest his great design but before we really get started into the genealogy let's look at what the number 40 represents um let's turn to Psalm 95 verse 8 through 10 the number 40 uh represents probation trial chastisement Psalm 95 8-10 Harden not your heart as in the provocation as in the days of Temptation in the wilderness when your fathers tempted me proved me and saw my work 40 years alone was I geve with this generation he said it is a people that do he in their heart and they have not known my ways I think about how this relates to the Book of Matthew after they they were looking at this king and the 40th book of the Bible presents the king for the Jews because Matthew was written from a Jewish perspective so think as we go through number 40 think about um now the 40th book of the Bible they're putting on probation what are you going to do with this Christ who's presented before you M and acts 13:18 about the time of 40 years suffered he Their Manners in the wilderness so he suffered they were on probation see what are you what are you going to do on trial and now let's turn to Judges chapter 3 and then we're going to have to go to judges 5 and then judges 8 so what we just looked at was 40 Years of probation by trial now we're going to look at 40 years of probation by Prosperity Judges chapter 3 chapter 3 ver 11 and the land had rest 40 years and often the ill the son of KZ died so what what he would do is give them four a space of 40 Years of rest and after that 40 years they would start going back into uh idolatry and the things that they had come out of right and and uh remember ofil was I think uh Caleb's nephew or lady Caleb somehow I can't remember de let's go to judges 5:31 so let all thine enemies perish oh Lord but let them that love him be as the son and he goeth forth in his might and the land had rest 40 years now let's go to judges 8:28 thus was median subdued before the children of Israel so that they lifted up their heads no more and the country was in quietness 40 years in the days of bean they would they would get Prosperity they have a time of Peace where they could maybe study the word and uh and then they would return back into what they would come from now let's uh Google 40 Years of prosperity in in under their kings let's go to 2 Samuel 5 2 Samuel 5 David was 30 years old when he began to Reign and he reigned 40 years in Hein he reigned over Judah 7 years and 6 months and in Jerusalem he reigned 33 30 and3 years over all Israel and Judah now if David reigned 40 years how many years do you think Solomon R let's go to First Kings 11:42 H do you mind repeating the verse one get First Kings First Kings 11 start 42 they get SP brother you get that scream out I was just Che yeah and I'm 68 what do you all expect First Kings 11:42 and the time that Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel was 40 years and uh also there's a few other kings jehoash joash jobal and II that rained for 40 years and then 40 Years of probation of humiliation and servitude I'll just read this to you judges 131 and the children of Israel Israel did Evil again in the sight of the Lord and the Lord delivered them into the hand of the Philistines 40 years 1st Samuel 4:18 and it came to pass when he made mention of the ark that he fell this is Eli after he heard that the Ark of the Covenant had been taken and it came to pass when he made mention of the Ark of of God that he fell from off the seat backward by the side of the gate and his neck broke and he died for he was an old man and heavy and he had judged Israel 40 years and acts 13:21 and after where they desired a king and God gave unto them Saul the son of sis a man of the tribe of Benjamin by the space of 40 years so it says in the New Testament the saw L for 40 years and in 40 Years of probation by waiting Moses in Egypt when he was 40 years it came to his heart to visit his brother and the children of Israel Moses and Midian when he 40 years were expired there appeared to him in the wilderness of Mount Si an angel of of the Lord and Flame a fire in a bush and then uh there's a peri eight periods of 40 days think by the number eight 48 times throughout the Bible 4 40 days Moses was in the mount MH 40 days Moses was in the mount after the sin of the golden cast that's Deuteronomy 9:1 18:25 40 days of the spies issuing the penal sentence of the 40 years in numbers 13:26 40 Days of Elijah and or First Kings 198 40 days of Jonah and Nineveh 40 days Ezekiel lay on his right side that symbolized the 40 Years of judah's transgression 40 days Jesus was tempted of the devil 40 days Jesus was s of his disciples speaking of the things pertaining to the kingdom of God after his resurrection acts 1 12 so and uh let me find my little cheat Che uh numbers so the number eight represents eternity the first of a new series eight periods of 40 days testifying of trial and probation so now we just have a few more minutes left let me get back to Matthew so we talked about how uh was kind of on the theme of Jesus is not the natural offspring of anyone and uh you know he his father and mother were not Joseph and Mary if you're in Christ you know how brother talked about one day he realized that his mother and father will not Charles and Ella if you're in in Christ you uh you take you are his gen are manifested in you so all of the promises that uh were prophesied of who was to come are fulfilled or are spoken of in these two genealogies so let me read I'm just going to just listen you don't have to turn I'm going to run down through some of these promise prophecy Promises of how uh the gene theology would would come and Genesis 3:15 I will put imy between thee and the woman and between thy seed and her seed it shall bruise thy head and thou shalt bruise his he we know no a woman doesn't have a seed the seed of the woman was Christ and that was fulfilled in Galatians 4:4 when when Paul said but when the fullness of the time was come God sent forth his son made of a woman made under the law uh in Genesis 12:3 God promised that the seed would come through descending of Abraham and I will bless them that bless thee and curse him that curseth thee and in thee shall all families of the Earth Earth be blessed and Matthew 1:1 testifies that the book of the generation of Jesus Christ the son of David the son of Abraham Genesis 17:19 and God said Sarah thy wife shall bear thee a son indeed and thou shalt call his name Isaac and I will establish my Covenant with him and for an ever for an Everlasting Covenant and with his seed after him and Matthew and Luke both testify that the seed came through Isaac numbers 247 17 I shall see him but not now I Shall Behold Him but not nigh there shall come a star out of Jacob and a scepter shall rise out of Israel and shall Smite the corners of Moab and destroy all the children of sh and that's testifying that he come through Jacob there's a I don't have there's a huge list of all of these prophecies that testify in minute detail everything this uh because his word is so perfect not one jot or tit will pass away that's right Genesis 49 10 says the scepter shall not depart from the Judah nor a lawgiver from between his feet until Shiloh come into him shall the Gathering of the people be it'll come from Judah and we're going to look when when we go further on how the birth right went to not Judah but to Joseph right and uh so we're going to take a look at that later on as we progress but Luke 3:33 testifies that um the son of aminadab which was the son of Aon which was the son of ezam which was the son of FZ which was the the son of Judah he will come from Judah then Isaiah 11:10 in that day there shall be a root of Jesse which shall stand for an inside of the people to it shall the gentille seek and his rest shall be glorious he's going to be descendant of Jesse and again and Romans 5:12 again Isaiah sayi it shall be a Ru of Jesse and he that shall rise to rign over the Gentiles in him shall the Gentiles trust Jeremiah 23 prophesy that behold the days come sayth the Lord that I will rais unto David A righteous branch and a king shall reign in resp and shall execute judgment and Justice in the earth and we we looked a couple of weeks ago at how the the the different Prophecies of who the branch would be that he would be the king and a servant just like these four Matthew Mark Luke and John present him as those four uh present him in those four ways just like in the uh the Tabernacle the four pillars presented the uh the veil with the Tans on it presenting him as lion ox man and Eagle Isaiah 9:7 said let me finish reading that number four in his days Judah shall be saved and Israel shall dwell safely and in this is his name whereby he shall be called the Lord our righteousness Isaiah 9:7 said of the increase of his government and peace there shall be no end upon the throne of David and upon his kingdom to order it and to establish it with judgment and with Justice from hence forth even forever the Zeal of the Lord of po to perform this he's an heir to the throne of David so the the genealogy is to present him but he's not actually connected by genes his father and mother are not Joseph and Mary and our spiritual father and mother are not anyone of the flesh right but God um let's see let's uh let's look at uh as you go down through the genealogy you'll come to jeah so let's turn to Jeremiah 22:30 we know God promised David that you never Jeremiah 23:30 223 that's what I said 22 oh 22 or 23 come let me see if I start let's start at verse 24 Jeremiah 22 verse 24 as I live sayith the Lord the kah the son of jeim King of king of Judah with a signant upon my right hand yet would I pluck thee th and I will give thee into the hand of them that seek thy life and into the hand of them whose face thou fearest even into the hand of nib razar king of Babylon and into the hand of the calans and I will cast thee out and thy mother that bear thee into another country where you were not born there shall you die but to the land whereinto they desire to return thither shall they not return is this man kah he K jeah went by the name kah and jeah is this man kah a despised broken Idol is he a vessel wherein is no pleasure wherefore are they cast out he and his seed and are cast into a land which they know not oh Earth Earth Earth hear the word of the Lord thus sayith the Lord right ye this man childless a man that shall not prosper in his days for no man of his seed shall prosper sitting upon the throne of David and ruling anymore in Judah this is the last king of of Judah uh there were no more kings that came forth from J from Janiah and we know Nebuchadnezzar put uh zedekiah in charge zedekiah was jeanah Uncle no there are no Kings after zaniah that proceeded from this genealogy now so it looks like genealogy stopped where's the where's God's promise to David and the God's promise to David was fulfilled in Christ because he came to set up a new kingdom not a kingdom of the Earth but a spiritual Kingdom and that's what we stop for now thank you I'll set here go ahead know
