========================================

oh thank you father open the eyes of my heart want to see to see you high pour out your power and love it pour out your power and love oh something collected off all at once so it shouldn't be back up now it's working tone me down a little bit just working that hey man good to see everybody in the house of the lord i hope you're uh well fed and fatted up over the christmas time and all of that to

that's that's fine but we're glad to have our visitor back there with us and we always say when you come here one time you're a visitor you come two times you don't get welcome because it's not a you

your visitor next time your brother and whatever in the lord but glad to have you with us and pray the lord we bless you and i'll remember the announcements that wade was making to watch night service remember this coming weekend that brother jackson will be preaching for us from the morning in the evening service sunday then monday we'll be starting at eight o'clock for the uh going on into the midnight hour and having a good time in the lord so we're looking forward to that amen uh remember the announcements too that little little ace was not feeling good today so remember him and and their travels and things like if you like turning your scriptures turn where we've been reading from revelations 1 and revelations 8. let's just go to the lord in prayer heavenly father we thank you this night for the opportunity to be able to come together to fellowship one with the other and to walk in the light of your love we pray tonight that you would come among us and speak to our hearts and our lives because that's what we've gathered for not to be seen or to see but to hear from you because truly we believe faith comes by hearing and hearing by the word of the lord so just have your way now as we read your word you come and speak to our hearts and guide each and every one of us you said in your word that you sent your word had healed us and delivered us from destruction so then there's sickness among us tonight then you'll be here to take care of all things have your way now we love you and we thank you in jesus name amen revelations one we've been reading this for quite a while and we've been studying in the book of revelations so let's start off with verse one the revelation of jesus christ which god gave unto him to shew and to his servants things which must shortly come to pass and he said and signified it by his angel and to his servant john who by record of the word of god and the testimony of jesus christ and of all things that he saw blessed is he that readeth and they they hear the words of this prophecy and keep those things which are written therein for the time is at hand time to understand i believe don't you but you think the hours here that we should understand the word and we've had in a long time all right revelations 8 1 and when he had opened the seventh seal there was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour you may be seated whoever that is blessing to the reading of the word now as i said we've been in the book of revelations now for quite a while and we've gotten over to the 8th chapter and we've been dealing with the opening of the word revealing in chapter 1 where that we can see that john was commissioned to write and send what he saw down to the church ages as we called it or the church is there names them off it was to give the to bring the message to them and then you know then he would get over and and then he would be bring down what would happen in those church ages through chapter two and chapter three and then going over to chapter four then we see an amazing thing because john is taken up all right caught up taken up and he went up into heaven and then as he did he began to tell what he saw he looked around he saw the throne he saw one on the throne he saw the many things saw the elders saw the the calling out and then we went on over to chapter five and bringing it into a great joyous time as to the people that would be there in those things and and then went into chapter six and chapter six starts dealing with the seals and we went through those things and bringing out the symbols from each seal and speaking of those things and then coming down to the end of it all as we reading here of chapter eight when it said when he had opened the seventh seal there were silence in heaven about the space of half an hour you know we can understand we went through it this past few services talking about that the seals were broke by the lamb now the lamb takes the book and releases the seals and and that lamb would be the lamb of god that john pointed out when he was here on earth you know it's no problem to know who the lamb is because the bible tells you he says behold the lamb of god it takes away the sin of the world all right and as he pointed him out then when it comes to hear the lamb is opening the seals and revealing it or showing it would be a better way of saying it unto john there as he's on patmos and remember he's commissioned to write what he sees and send it back down to the the the church ages and then then getting into that then we know that we have to have those things we've been taught you know that back in our older ages and times a man taught a lot of it that uh stay out of the book of revelations well that was probably a pretty good point to a lot of people because they couldn't understand but once the symbols are broken once the the things happens that for us to understand then it's a beautiful marvelous book and it's not trying to figure out things it's trying to just say what it says and and uh you know move on in that but we've gotten up here to the seventh seal and it just says a silence in heaven there's nothing written there to give any understanding so thereby we realized that and and the brother back there i'm sure he knows anything about us he he knows that we believe god sent a prophet all right and we don't make him no more than what the bible makes all of the prophets because we don't worship no man we don't deal with those things he was a human being just like anyone else but he come to bring us the message and in doing that then if there's silence in heaven and nothing is said the then um irregardless of what anyone would believe about us or what we believe in a prophet coming anybody that would read the bible would realize if you come to a silence in heaven and uh you need to know what's going on something calls that silence right right i mean that's just reading that's just taking third grade reading as we'd call it and just reading the book you know and saying well they're silence in heaven well then we realize that there must be something there that that you and i need to know about amen right all right because it's in the book and what are the seven seals what have we been through over and over it's the plan of redemption amen all right those were the things that were uh sealed up as daniel said when it comes to the end of the writings of the of the the meats and persians the different ones in the writings and telling you all about it comes down through there and he comes down to the end and and he's told to seal up right see it was to be sealed up he said until the end time well truly we ought to believe by looking around at the world that we're in the end time that shouldn't be any problems as i said third grade reading and third grade education were to let us know we're in the end of the world we're not setting dates and times in no way did brother brown ever set them you know everybody accused him of it but i'm saying 77 he said don't you say i said 77 when he the rapture he said i'm not saying it it was mankind putting their own interpretation onto what they thought well but see all i want to know is if we need to know these things then how are we to find them out who is to come to do these things and to make known these things and to us because it would require a profit you agree with that if there's silence in heaven and there's nothing there to to go on you know then it would require that god would send a prophet and according to amos like three and seven he said he does nothing until he reveals he said but he revealed his secrets to the prophets all right the prophets were god's mouthpiece they spoke in the in the point of on the earth and that's why those prophets would say thousands of thousands of times throughout the bible they would say thus saith the lord amen all right now what does that mean that means the lord was speaking to the prophet all right well he would say thus sayeth the prophet or thus saith you know jeremiah or something no no it would always thus saith the lord for the lord was speaking through the prophets to bring the word unto you and i but he had to have somebody to write it down that was the way the bible was written all the way through was god speaking to mankind to write the word all right we say well now that's just man's ideas no not when it's thus saith the lord that's not man's ideas man's ideas is what messes up but when we look at it and we see that god has promised us throughout the word in the end of time that things would take place all right then that's why that we believed that god did send a prophet all right if i didn't believe he was sent had sent one i'd be hunting for one there's too much in the word that has to come to the prophet for you and i to be able to understand all right then if it is then let's find him and rally around behind it right you know i mean if it's billy graham or roberts whatever you know let's get behind them and find out who it is you see and in doing all of that we come back to the basis of believing that god sent us a way to understand amen and we're we're to that point of where that we say well the word of god is the truth amen all right see if you can find it in the word then you can lay your life on it because we have to lay our life on it anyway he said well that was just some man well who are you right who spoke to you right you know i mean you got to you got it you know you said oh that's just some man that wrote the bible well who are you where'd you get what you got my bible says that everything we have we received it is that the scripture right everything we have the hour we breathe the clothes we wear that everything should be counted to the basis of knowing that god give it unto us so then we have to let on to that all right we see then when we come to this portion of the scriptures we're truly dependent upon god sending a prophet well so then you've got as i say it want to go you've got the chapter one you've got the beautiful things that are said there in chapter 1 about god revealing himself and bringing himself forth unto the ages then you've got the writings of the ages coming down and we believe that we're in the last age for the last age would be the lady of sin and if you don't believe that you need to open your eyes and go out on the world and look around a little bit because according to my understanding of ladies it means people's rights and if that don't fit today we're living in i don't know where it does because everybody wants their rights you know i mean you you get a guy and he breaks into your home and and you're doing the best you can to try to keep them hurting him and you don't even pull a gun on him or something but he falls over the coffee table in the living room the ambulance comes and gets him and you think that's all of it because you know you try to turn him over to the police come find out about a month later you get a bill for all of the money that you owed well in the old days it would have been better to shock the man you know because that wouldn't be right as a christian but at least you got rid of the problem so nowadays it's people's rights not just black or hollering for their rights white green yellow whatever color we are everybody wants their rights right well that's sure to prove in the last days all right but now it says in revelations 3 14 that unto the angel of the lady of sin drop these things saith the amen the faithful the true witness etcetera all right so if that was the last angel then our dependence is upon that angel to be of this church age no one would argue any whatsoever or shouldn't in any mentality of form shouldn't argue that the apostle paul was a messenger to the first church age you know and establishing it coming forth and bringing the word and then you wouldn't argue with uh once coming down through there and surely wouldn't argue with luther wesley and all because luther brought the message to the just shall live by faith that was the word of god being restored sure it was a days of reformation but we're promised according to i believe it's ezekiel that we're to be in a day of restoration not reformation within him that said i will restore all things all right then we're in the hour for it to be restored see to do that then we must have a messenger right we must have someone to be able to link it all to and i'm not just preaching this for a brother he may think that you may think that but i don't think that right i'm trying to tell the truth right yeah i don't mind talking plain other people you know beat around you don't know what to do i don't mind being blind and blown about what i'm saying because you see if we don't have our dependence upon god sending us a prophet to be able to understand the things of the word of god where are we is our total dependence placed upon as i say in there the other day whether or not god kept his word you know if he kept his word we don't have to worry about it right i i like to read in the book to find promises don't you because you like to find the promises in the book and then well god you said you'd do that right you said if i'd repent and be baptized in the name of jesus christ remission of sins i received the gift of the holy ghost but you know what i i took in his word now believe that right but you see everything is laying on if there's silence and you don't have anything to go on as we read in that date one the others you have points and illustrations for examples or are peoples or symbols and things to go on you just need to know what those symbols mean but when you come to the seventh seal then it's just silence like we got to depend upon god to give us his word right you know there's another silence in the word of god if you'll turn over to revelations 10 we'll go through that scripture but brother would pull out that revelation 10 first because there's a silence there as i said when daniel saw the great coming forth and i love the book of daniel because once you get into it and see what he's doing it's one constant vision over and over it's not many visions that's where you get messed up you try to read him and try to figure out this vision you try to figure out this mission you try to figure out this vision that daniel's bringing if you'll quit that then just read it and just let it connect together and just flow through the book and you can see that he's explaining time and life and things to daniel and that brings it down to a beautiful point in our day but look what it says lindsey as i said in daniel he says seal it up right seal it up all right what i'm just looking at is some points look what he says in revelations 10 1 i saw him another mighty angel come down from heaven over the crowd cloud in the rainbow was on his head and his face is where the sun is feeding it's going to fire that's christ now that's not brother branham see we don't believe that a lot of people believe that brother branham was god and all kinds of things but that's their business i don't go along with it here i believe that was that was christ standing the same as he was over in revelations one about verse 13 where he stood in the midst of the seven golden candlestick like unto the son of man gerd about to pout for the golden girdle that's the same christ that's the christ that come all the way through the bible that's the one to be to be made known see a mighty angel all right he said he hadn't even had a little book open now you in the seals we've been studying the book has been sealed and the lamb opens the seals all right but you'll find a book in revelation about six there is closed because six one because he had to start breaking the seals here it says the book is open all right and he set his right foot on the sea and the left foot on the earth great big fella isn't it no not when you go back to bible terminologies and realize he's standing on the sea and upon the land and see if people in the land is people and it's still christ that we're talking about and once and this one that was standing there cried with a loud voice that's when a lion roared when he had cried thunders uttered their voices seven thunders uttered their voices this one that was standing on earth isn't what just happened and when the seven thunders that other voices and i was about to write and i heard a voice from heaven saying unto me seal up those things which is seven thunders letters and write them not now you're already over in the 10th chapter that's just spoke to us up above here that the book is open but now there seems to be some secret things that are closed now the bible says the things that are revealed belong to his children but the secret things it says belongs unto god who gave it right all right see anyone have to have some way to get to god to find out what's going on and as we do then we see that when they utter their voices it was john was commissioned to write he was going to write down he heard what happened but he said right or not now what are you going to do silence in heaven and write it not would that tie together and be the same things if you don't write something there's silence john your commission to bring back to the church the word of god now john what do you say he says and the angel which i saw stand upon the sea and upon the earth lifted up his hand to heaven even on earth went up in heaven the silence a moment ago we read in 8 1 there the silence was in heaven but when he comes to earth he left him with a hand to heaven could it be the reason silences have tried to get to you there's a reason there's silence in heaven doesn't mean they scott's on earth carnally speaking they'll never be silenced on the earth there'll always somebody to one of us somewhere be running her mouth right but it'll always be sounds and things on earth with those seven thunders he said don't write it sorry john took his pen to right he was fixing to write down what those thunders said you know evidently he said don't write it john what else did you see this one that was standing on the scene on the earth lifted his hand to heaven and swire by him that liveth forever and ever all right we don't establish jesus christ we want to student who created heaven and the things that they're in our in the city earth and the things that they're they're in and the sea and the things which are are in that there should be time no longer it's coming to an end not in heaven on earth that's why i love that little word there john you're commissioned to write to the church and tell the church what you saw now john how are you going to get this back to the church so it strikes john and he enters a understanding he said but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel which would be the messenger to the lady of sin age right thought it would be the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of god should be finished as he had declared to his servants the prophets which would mean someone is going to have to come whether we're looking for somebody we found somebody or whatever we've got to be dependent upon one thing as i said we got to find out there's a prophet would have to come and in the days of the sounding of that prophet the mysteries would be revealed and he had declared to his servants the prophets plural then say this to one prophet there's a mystery sealed up in the word of god that all of the prophets has pointed at all of the prophets that spoke about it would you agree man and that's what we need to know is what all of those prophets would know and could tell us the bible says that you and i the body of christ as believers right have entered into a position that even the old testament prophets desire to look into you remember that description but there was unable to one because the new birth had not come you know eternal life had not come to be made manifest in a human body the lord jesus christ had that eternal life within him he had to die to release that life to be able for it to come back upon you and i as the new birth baptism of the holy ghost whatever you want to call it and as it comes forth then is the one to teach us all things according to the scripture didn't jesus say that he said if i don't go away the comforter won't come right now putting together all the other scriptures with him what was he saying if the comforter don't come to you and i we have no way of knowing anything right right and jesus said what that said he'll bring this holy ghost will bring to your remembrance whatsoever i've said now once you remember the scripture the rest of it it said even teach you things to come so those disciples he taught them the word when that baptism of the holy ghost came on the death pentecost he took them into a deeper understanding and could tell them things to come right he spoke of his coming right see nobody's supposed to know about it he said when you see these things begin to come to vice you remember he asked them there which in matthew 24 which is the same as revelation 6 1 coming to the seals in matthew 24 they asking three questions when will it be that there won't be one stone on another and want to be the sound of thy coming now the end of the world all right well let me they won't be swung stones that jesus was talking about the temple around right titus in 80 70 came in and totally destroyed jerusalem tore down the walls everything and that's what he describes when he gets over in matthew 24. you hear wars rumors and wars these things read matthew 24 same thing as revelation 6 in the opening of the seals all right and what i mean the sign of thy coming the thing that mankind could never understand that jesus would be speaking of in his life was the sign of the son of man even your writers couldn't understand that paul never talked of it peter and him never spoke of it john and him only wrote what would say it you know the writings of the gospels none of them in any other writings spoke of the son of man but he told him he said hey some of you standing here today is going to see me and my company a saying went out among us remember saying went out among the apostles that some of them weren't going to die the bible said how be it he didn't say that that's right he didn't say they wasn't going to die he said they're going to see my coming any bible reader knows then it's really a understanding of the word that you you go to jesus on the mount of transfiguration and you find elijah and moses appearing to jesus on the mount of transfiguration talking to him about his coming because that's what matthew thirst do it well that's exactly the way it's going to be first off elijah was to bring the word to the gentiles but then one day those two witnesses will be standing there which is moses and elijah over in the book of revelation 13 and they'll be able to call down fire to be to the gentiles to be to the jews with their jews coming to the jewish race of people but the things that are happening will happen to all of the world that's the sign of his coming the lord jesus christ had the resurrection signed the dead was raised it's the sound of jonah the resurrection the son of is coming he spoke more of his second coming than he did his first coming right he spoke so much of it until two little sisters one day said would you let our children sit where boys you know one said on one side of you and the other said on the other side of you in your kingdom they knew he was talking about something but they couldn't figure it out but the other question was what of the end of the world at the end of the known world will be at the end of the sixth seal as we've covered because it's great earthquakes great happenings the earth will be wiped off and getting ready for a millennial rain not destroyed there's no words in there for destroyed right it'll be wiped off and cleansed to be used because it's still in the regeneration plan noah drop in the days of noah god washed off the earth the days of the lord jesus he dropped his blood upon it to cleanse and claim it one of these days it'll get a fiery baptism yes but not going into the millennial rain millennium rain will be a cleansing getting ready under that sixth seal to understand but you see we're promised in the bible these things will happen let's go to malachi 4 and just see what the promises are that's why i love the word to be able to study the word to remember you the law of moses my servant which i commanded unto you and and these are with the statues and in other words put everything you got on the word is that what he said he's not just reminding them to remember the law to remember this he's telling to put everything they got on the word anything we have must be related to the word of god it can't be related to our ideas then what does he say behold i send you elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the lord he said well that was john the baptist i would go back and read my scriptures if i'd real careful go to luke 117. and you'll find out that john fulfilled the first half of that right john turned the hearts of those old testament saints to the new testament message that's the lord jesus was bringing right see somebody's got to come in the end time and do the opposite now what right what did they do they turned the hearts of the fathers to the children that's what john donne luke 1 17. and you say well john done all of that well then he turned right back under the law right why because there's another part in the heart of the children to their fathers unless they come and smite the earth with a curse so if john turned him over we believe he did but if he turned him back he put him right back under the law right that won't follow that won't line up with the word see we got to depend upon god to keep his word to bring that prophet unto us in the end time to fulfill his scriptures like luke 17 30 as i said a while ago about the son of man so look what it says even though shall it be in the day when the son of man is revealed none of those writers back there find it bring it to me even the great apostle paul none of his writings he speaks of son of man because that would be for the end time that's why luke or their works reading i believe it's in matthew but worse about 13 or 16 were strong about who the man when jesus said who do man say i the son of man i am peter spoke up and said dark the christ that wasn't what jesus was asking he asked him who the christ was john had done declaring to be the christ the scripture is already declaring to be the christ of god but he said who's the son of man peter said lord to christ jesus didn't lambast him and do like we do you know well you don't know what you're doing because he knew he knew part of what was going on so he said peter upon this rock not on peter right i don't know stone laying there not no peter or the catholic church no not even on jesus right but on what did he say upon this rock this revelation i'll build my church and the gates of hell shall not prevail against the boy it's right today took them down to the lowest they have to could beat them in the dark ages but god had a promise i will restore he said he bring it back another word in simple language he was telling peter you don't understand me but you understand enough about the christ you understand enough of what i'm doing you know i've come to bring a church to a place to a new birth i said one day in the end of all things i'll bring to pass then a son of man that's what he couldn't understand brother branham when he began to talk he never declared himself to be big son of man no he said i'm a son of man the son of man is the lord jesus christ that's badness if we'd have thought about it the bible says john the baptist i come from the baptist church really i'm saying but john the baptist meant there's only one so we formed a church behind and thinking it was john the baptist well there was only one baptist and that was john if we took that start we'd do it the better denomination you see all right but it says the son of man the lord jesus christ is the one to be revealed in the end time amen that's right that is the prophet amen amen you with almighty god in human flesh but he was fulfilling the office of a prophet right that's why they could take him and kill that body because all the prophets were destroyed right except moses and you've got enough elijah we got we know the bible but the basics of the prophets were killed all right come on they were destroyed but in the days when the son of man would be revealed or made known wrote out the open word reveal means to to bring into view or or to open you know and to bring those things out all right but the the son of man the son of man means god made flesh among us a simple language which plain language is god might manifest among us let's have a registered with us but now to not move them out of the story we back up to understanding a little bit that we read in revelations 8 1 where there's silence in heaven for about the space of half an hour well something took place or it would not have been silence whatever took place made him stand in the hall right all those angels cherubims the 24 elders the the many different ones stood in all when this event took place where did it take place not in heaven because it stays psychos that was what i was trying to get you to see there sunday that out of those seven seals it's not breaking one two three four and five and six and then the silence if we don't know what that salad seal is it's still solid that's right the seventh seal would reveal what is all of the word and tied together amen be the end of all things because the number seven is completion right god created the world in six days rest in the seventh is completion there is no eight eight is back to a one to put you over into eternity brings you that way well silence in heaven if it doesn't say silence on earth because god sent us a prophet a prophet to reveal the word of god unto us and we believe it to be luke 17 30 revelation 10 7. we believe it to be like we read during revelations 10 where there were seven thunders wrote in their voices you know there was a voice in the bible one time that was called a thunder look john 12 and that's really john 12. this is jesus standing on the earth when he was there talking he's bringing down the layout of his life and what he's doing and he says father glorify thy name then there came a voice from heaven saying i have both glorified nor fight it no i'm glorified again and what and the people therefore that stood by and heard it said that it thundered others said an angel spake to him jesus actually said this voice came not because of me but for your sake jesus said glorify me with the glory that i had with me before the foundational world and a voice from heaven speaks out and says i've glorified you and i'll do it again it thundered well you know what a lot of people standing around her but jesus knew what was said right you know what same voice that thundered on mount sinai you told the people don't you touch this mountain because the thunder is the voice of god speaking to us he thundered in a thunder there to the children of israel one time the thunder the voice of god god speaking to you and i is a thunder right amen amen but when it's revealed it's the word of god amen you know that god one day whispered in a man's ear by the name of moses or in his thinking whatever you want to call it inner being and he told him about a lot of times you know that voice speaking into moses moses just turned right around and spoke it right back out just what god said see a prophet who comes the bible says and speaks presumptuously it don't come to vice you're supposed to take him out and kill him that's what the bible says we don't go along with murder but that's what the bible says you know that in the old testament form if a man prophesied alive mama and daddy was supposed to kill him i'm reading bible whether you believe it or not because you're supposed to do away from all of that sin from among you of somebody claiming to be this or claiming to be that but john writing on patmos he was told to seal up those thunders we need to know what to say because that's our only hopes right what is the end of the world what is a rapture to you what is a thoughts of of time or whatever well it just ends no no the bible says the end of all things has come upon us you know the bible says that christ was the end of the law for righteousness you know what that really means if you're not born again you're still under the law amen come on oh no brother to hell now the law ended 2000 years ago it only did to the born-again believer right that's right everybody else is still under the law come on i'm open for discussion make sure you bring the word law is still in existence today unless you're born again christ is the end of that law for righteousness amen to them to believe he said what's god going to judge the world by one day brother dale by the law and there's no grace in law amen there was grace while the law was in existence yes come on but there's no grace in the law the law said thou shalt not but you see church we got to know what those thunders were or else we're not going to get out of here i believe those thunders were exactly what the prophet has taught us but no seals broke it's odd that they seven thunders and their seven seals that's not a mismatched mismatching calculation that's a gospel truth see then when that first seal broke to that prophet god spoke to him what that was he came out and spoke it and told us what those symbols were that was the voice of god that's the way i believe the prophet is he's the voice of god to the age he takes the word of god and speaks and he must compare that's it there's where the people today claim to be prophets can they compare with the rest of the world will it be baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ and what this bible says right no no i'm going to take father son holy ghost then you're the liar the bible don't say that that's a catholic doctrine in the catholic church spoke down your throat almost 2 000 years ago now they were arguing at the nicean council 325 a.d where the jesus was god or a light substance by 606 they had developed the trinity there is no word in the bible of trinity it's not there he's a triune being because he's father son and holy ghost just like you are trial and being but you're only one person you're body spirit soul you're only one person the bible says even the eternal godhead can be understood by the things that we see right christ revealing the word if a prophet speaks not according to this bible he's not a prophet right i don't care what his name is or who he is he's got to be according to this word you deny anything it says in this bible then i don't have to worry about whether you're a prophet or not and the bible even says if a prophet come and give you a sign and that sign comes to pass but he takes you to another god don't believe it that's right that's bible right but do we believe the word of god or we just leave our own ideas and i said to start with we're in lady osea which means people's rights and people say today i've got a right to believe what i want to that's okay by the constitution it gives you that the bible don't give you a right to believe nothing but what it says right we're not talking about a constitution telling us we can believe you're not born again by a constitution you're born again by the word of god amen if that word of god is not revealed to you and i where are we so we got to know what no standards say we know now that it's enough to know that even you would thunder there when jesus was all right the voice from heaven would sound like a thunder in the bible those people heard god speaking right but everybody else around there heard it thunders right right that's why we got to depend upon god so he promised us the way to understand and he did he gave us luke 17 30. the day when the son of man would be revealed he gave us malachi 4. behold i send you elijah the prophet and he'll turn the hearts of the fathers to the children and then the children to the father can you bring it over to revelation 10 and sound fourth but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he begins to sound do we need to know who that seventh angel is right we need to start searching you see church i don't have to search because i already believe i know who it is but i wouldn't be believing that brother was a prophet if i didn't believe that it was not god no people in this message some of them worship him someone baptized in his name why because god was so prevalent in a man's life martin luther even recorded this what they did about him one time he said it was no problem being able to protest the catholic church he said it was to keep his head above the water of all the things that went with it you know that they thought luther taught for them to go out and you know they did they went out and destroyed churches in the days of luther he didn't teach them that that's right he taught reform he did not want to leave the catholic church i got it on writing he wanted to stay there and reform the church they put luther out he never put them out man men of god down to the bible have always been put out right that's right because it wouldn't people wouldn't follow the word right what about one day they're in the bible and i'll ended up saying this what about in the bible there you think people would be not so dumb and i don't mean that sarcastically i mean truth you remember the story when moses was there and he said all this on god's side come over here and you know what 250 priests preachers okay today 250 priests took hold off the altar which was the very altar that god had ordained for them to use and they're sensors and walked on the other side away from moses amen when they'd already seen moses parked the red sea you know not moses we know that's what god was doing to the man but still he had to use moses right they had seen all the miracles and signs and wonders that accompanied the man's ministry he actually destroyed egypt by his word and yet when they come out to that place 250 of them walked on the other side away from moses well you know what god done he just opened up the earth and swallowed him up do you know what happened the next day read your bible you're ready what happened the next day 250 people closing the ground standing in front of moses and he said see that i told you you can't argue with the word of god the next day read your bible they come to moses and said you destroyed the people of god that's right you think grace of god if moses would have stepped back and said death it would have locked out every one of them was standing there god had done told him before right said moses get out of the way i'll destroy him i'll raise up a nation of you moses showing it was christ in moses i know i'm putting together two or three different stories but i'm trying to get a point to you moses says god if you destroy them people you got to come over me right that's right you know god wouldn't come over moses that's right right he said go ahead moses take him to the promised land he said but i'll deal with him when it comes time he spared the people but he dealt with them is he church we can't turn down the prophets of god that are sent unto us we must believe and accept it because that's our only hopes of understanding god's word i know this may sound strange to some of me speaking of god sending a prophet in the last days but what's your hopes you think one of these days a bus is gonna pull up we're gonna all get on the bus and ride the glory i know that's carnal but plain language we're facing another time just like noah was right you know what in the days of noah was a modern world just like it is now because the bible says the bible says there's nothing new under the sun in the days of noah there would have been a scientific world looks like it is because there's life in it noah they said hey you need a boat we'll build you one he said but god didn't tell me to use your your stuff they were already tempering metal and all kind of things they would have made him a titanic if he wanted it but no he just labored out there for 120 years making a boat but when it floated that was the only thing that floated the church we've had a prophet to be sent to us that's right but do we believe it come on musicians do we believe it do we believe that's our only hopes of resting upon the word do we believe that god still can speak he spoke to me this afternoon and told me that i'd have to change my message tonight company was coming i'm generally a person to drive straight on when company comes and i'll do it according to what the leading is i had all my notes ready went back and tried to redo everything in the world got them piled up don't worry so i hope you get the point of what i'm trying to say we believe god sent a prophet and we believe what he taught yes amen believing that then we can put all our hopes up on one side that that prophet also told us there would be a variety take a rapture one day a change in the moment a twinkling i would come anybody oh is father in the name of jesus christ oh is is he's in jesus name right and when he gets dark is is is i is is oh in our thoughts and our minds this weekend with brother jackson coming to speak to us and then remember to watch night service starting at eight o'clock and going on into midnight and earth on monday and just pray that the lord would bless because we always try to just take our time and take the communion then when it comes around to the stroke of midnight and start off a new year not to make new year's resolutions but you're going to break them anyway so make a commitment to god amen and to follow in him in the newness of it amen father we thank you for this day and we pray that you would just bless each and every one we thank you for the visitors coming and being with us lord and just touch each one and bless each one open up our understanding of thy word lord that we may all be together in you we love you and we thank you and we commit it to you now have your way that you may be the god of our lives take care of everybody on the way home be with each and every one lord the weather out there is bad in all the conditions but we know you can take care of us all and we ask you guide us forgive us our sins and lead us by thy grace in jesus name thank you this me me foreign me me is is we were foreign uh
