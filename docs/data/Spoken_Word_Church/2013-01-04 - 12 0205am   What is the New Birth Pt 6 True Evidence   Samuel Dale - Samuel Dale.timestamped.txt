[7:54] yourself known among listen we're going
[7:56] to come down to indicate that with
[7:58] things that we've seen you do among us
[8:00] and we cannot deny the fact that you're
[8:02] here because we wouldn't even try to do
[8:04] but we would like to see you more and we
[8:06] realize that we're standing in your way
[8:08] because you're wanting to do it so we
[8:11] ask you to help us to get out of the way
[8:12] where we can see you living in our
[8:15] hearts and life have your way as we
[8:17] reach your word and come and speak to us
[8:19] about these things in any questions Lord
[8:22] you be the answer to these things in you
[8:25] in that way then we don't have to worry
[8:27] forgive our sins cleanse us and guide us
[8:30] in Jesus name Amen
[8:32] there we go to John
[8:36] one I mean done use the three three
[8:43] first one there was a name it there were
[8:45] the man of the Pharisees named Nicodemus
[8:47] a ruler of the Jews the same came to
[8:49] Jesus by night and said unclean rabbi we
[8:52] know that thou art a teacher come from
[8:54] God for no man can do these miracles
[8:56] that thou doest except God be with and
[8:59] they gave him a great honor Denny well
[9:01] jesus answered and said unto Him verily
[9:04] verily I say unto thee except a man be
[9:07] born again he cannot see the kingdom of
[9:09] God
[9:10] Nicodemus said to him how can a man be
[9:13] born when he is old can he enter the
[9:15] second time into his mother's womb and
[9:17] be born jesus answered verily verily I
[9:20] say unto thee except a man be born of
[9:22] water and of the spirit he cannot enter
[9:25] into the kingdom of God that which is
[9:28] born of the flesh is flesh and that
[9:30] which is born to the Spirit is spirit
[9:32] Marvel not that I said unto thee you
[9:35] must be born again I will pick up these
[9:39] two scriptures and tie together verse 26
[9:43] John 14 but the comforter which is the
[9:46] Holy Ghost whom the father will send in
[9:48] my name he shall teach you all things
[9:50] and bring to your remembrance whatsoever
[9:52] I have said unto you
[9:55] now watch it he will teach you all
[9:57] things and bring to your remembrance
[10:00] whatsoever I have say it alright now
[10:04] watch the next one as it goes over to
[10:07] the sixteenth chapter and verse 12 I
[10:13] have yet many things to say unto you but
[10:16] you cannot here bear them now howbeit
[10:19] when he the Spirit of Truth has come he
[10:21] will guide you into all truth what
[10:25] praise shall not speak of himself but
[10:28] whatsoever he hear that shall he speak
[10:32] and he will show you things to come
[10:36] then read satara further on the
[10:38] revelation fine he shall glorify me for
[10:42] he shall receive a man and show
[10:45] if I'm to you I might be see the door
[10:49] that is blessing to the reading of the
[10:51] word no I want you to keep those
[10:54] scriptures in mind because of what we
[10:59] were trying to cover their Wednesday
[11:00] night and we will review a little bit of
[11:03] it and all but I want you to keep those
[11:05] scriptures in mind that we read because
[11:09] as we read through hope back some this
[11:12] morning that brother Brown said that
[11:15] Jesus never said you to speak in tongues
[11:18] he never said to you a child she never
[11:21] said you'd do this annually he says you
[11:24] would receive the word and that would be
[11:28] the evidence of whether you're born
[11:29] together or not I mean then I tried to
[11:33] make myself plain about what I've said
[11:36] you know about this on the evidence and
[11:39] things and I firmly believe that the
[11:43] Bible really takes the profit bit you
[11:46] know when you receive the Holy Ghost
[11:50] that's the new birth the speaking and
[11:52] the tongues of doings you doing that's
[11:54] an act that's a an attribute of that
[11:57] that's a display of that he already got
[12:00] the Holy Ghost it's like they was in the
[12:02] upper room it says they are the tongues
[12:04] of fire settled each one of them all
[12:07] right now I don't believe that they set
[12:09] up their tongues of fire set on them and
[12:11] nobody move and then they run outside
[12:14] and everybody heard him speaking but
[12:17] that is the way did it happen that they
[12:19] were up stars when they receive the Holy
[12:22] Ghost and then when they went outside
[12:24] the people heard him speaking in you
[12:29] know their own tongue
[12:31] and the mystery has always been then in
[12:33] the hearing hearing not in a speakin as
[12:37] much
[12:37] Johannes based upon that alright let's
[12:41] see then that way I tried to show you
[12:43] that the disciples for three and a half
[12:46] years were tutors before holding those
[12:48] could follow man that's my money and he
[12:51] was the great one like a polish over
[12:53] there teaching that Jesus was the Christ
[12:55] but knowing nothing about the baptism of
[12:57] the Holy Ghost
[12:58] you know about x19 all right
[13:01] and see then that way you can cover it
[13:03] to that but then you know you don't do
[13:06] away with the fact that I said that on
[13:09] the day of Pentecost
[13:10] you got the Upper Room experience they
[13:12] take took three and a half years for
[13:14] them to get tutored to that point all
[13:16] right yes they were justified and
[13:18] sanctified but then on that time that
[13:24] they came out and spake those that were
[13:26] there only heard one sermon and they
[13:29] went through justification
[13:31] sanctification and the baptism of the
[13:33] Holy Ghost to receive eternal life all
[13:36] right so then we covered you can do that
[13:39] you can't believe all the way to
[13:42] receiving the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[13:44] at one time I believed in that but I
[13:46] believe that the biggest portion won't
[13:48] do it better what that's right all right
[13:50] so that's just my statements and I gave
[13:52] you the quote and I gave it back that
[13:54] we're reading at the end where time
[13:56] we're gonna read said very few people
[13:58] will relieve all the way to even receive
[14:01] it in the Holy Ghost I know very few
[14:04] people he said will believe all the way
[14:06] of the receipt well that means the
[14:07] majority is going to stop somewhere and
[14:10] not go all the way to receiving the
[14:12] baptism of the holy no all right then we
[14:16] talked about what would be the you know
[14:18] the doing of that and I told you that I
[14:21] believe in this thing we covered that we
[14:25] went over it not the age of Luther not
[14:27] Wesley not you know this is even time
[14:29] going on
[14:30] that helps Azusa Street but the new
[14:33] birth table and suits are strict and
[14:35] that's what a lot of people don't want
[14:37] to believe but they didn't have run
[14:39] around said the baptism of the Holy
[14:41] Ghost exactly like the book of Acts
[14:44] now the Susur Street was not the Upper
[14:47] Room experience because they were not -
[14:51] - they were Trinitarians in Azusa Street
[14:53] but it was the same way as the 3000
[14:56] outside we preached that to you for 47
[14:59] years about the difference between the
[15:01] upper room experience people of 120 and
[15:04] the 3000 outside but now I firmly
[15:07] believe that you cannot receive the
[15:09] baptism of the Holy Ghost until you
[15:11] first hear the word now because faith
[15:14] cometh by hearing hearing by the word
[15:16] and how can you do that and it's like I
[15:19] still talk to you a little bit Larry the
[15:21] other day about it and some of the
[15:23] sermons that they're in the scriptures
[15:25] they were some trying some of the
[15:26] Apostles was trying to pray for the
[15:28] people in the book of Acts you get the
[15:30] baptismal to go and they have you called
[15:32] Peter or John or one of the other to
[15:34] come down and lay hands on them and they
[15:36] receive the Holy Ghost all right what
[15:38] was wrong I mean you had apostles trying
[15:41] to bring the new birth all the people
[15:43] and they couldn't receive it it just
[15:45] wasn't doing but when do you know that
[15:47] they were a little something little
[15:50] something I don't nobody was ever a
[15:51] little something that it caused the
[15:53] problem they couldn't receive it well
[15:55] then I believe that you must be taught
[15:57] the word the seat must be laid in to us
[16:03] Jesus preached the word to the disciples
[16:06] for three light years and then the Holy
[16:08] Ghost with the network and that was the
[16:10] Newmark
[16:11] all right now see then in that we
[16:13] believe in and I believe in three
[16:16] definite steps of grace our sages are we
[16:20] don't want to use the word works from
[16:21] the Prophet we gave you that where he
[16:23] said it's not works because it's not
[16:25] there's a work of the Holy Spirit
[16:27] yes in our lives but it's not works with
[16:30] no salvation don't
[16:31] my works but it comes in stage yes
[16:34] that's all right
[16:36] then I believe now in this age in time
[16:39] where we're at that to how the new work
[16:42] you must come to justification
[16:43] sanctification the baptism of the Holy
[16:46] Ghost the how did you work all right
[16:48] now then I believe in each a each one of
[16:50] those having a sale for a stage if you
[16:53] do it at one time right at the altar all
[16:55] right you still come through you're
[16:58] gonna have to come through that you
[17:00] gonna have to be repented you're going
[17:02] to have to be sanctified and then you'll
[17:04] have to be filled with the Holy Spirit
[17:05] all right so that way I believe that
[17:07] it's all tied together and they
[17:09] shouldn't be any argument or question
[17:11] about what the the doings of the new
[17:14] birth it's the purpose of the work all
[17:17] right if we had to hurt the word how
[17:19] here we without a preacher and happy to
[17:22] preach unless the he be sent the covers
[17:24] into the point then that means all
[17:26] people that called us up preachers or
[17:28] not preachers now there might be
[17:29] preachers but they're not you know
[17:31] anything remember I gave it to you where
[17:33] brother rather said false prophets
[17:35] produced false birth he said but true
[17:38] prophets bring truth birthday all right
[17:42] that's what I believe is a definite time
[17:44] that you were justified never that time
[17:46] you were sanctified and definite time of
[17:49] the baptism I only know if you go
[17:51] through it at one time you still went
[17:53] through that but if it takes years to go
[17:56] through the process right so what
[17:59] they'll come on in right it's the Sun
[18:02] and if you're predestinated unto it
[18:05] you're gonna come to the right right if
[18:08] you're not you're not gonna come to that
[18:10] as this solves the problem there
[18:11] shouldn't be any any point of argument
[18:15] about the things all right
[18:17] and in doing that then see we covered
[18:20] the last as though the new birth being
[18:22] what the birth of the word so that's
[18:26] what it's been in every age if we are
[18:29] are the children Jesus was actually
[18:31] birthed by the word a birth means are
[18:34] coming forth into what the word birth
[18:36] means coming forth into as he actually
[18:38] came Jesus himself came forth into human
[18:41] flesh and was birthed out of a mother
[18:44] you know you know that and that was his
[18:47] part he didn't have to have the new
[18:49] birth because he was the birth he wasn't
[18:53] loud you didn't need a savior he was to
[18:57] say about honor
[18:58] receiving we've seen all of that then we
[19:00] got to talk about the evidence of the
[19:03] holy spirit and you know I was all over
[19:06] the news quite a few of these from the
[19:08] past of what we were talking about
[19:10] Wednesday night and then you know you
[19:12] can go back in and listen to it but
[19:15] Brunn around the he's States on Christ
[19:17] the minister of God revealed paragraph
[19:19] 233 these are not coming up on the
[19:21] screen then Christ mr. Vadra until 63
[19:24] 720 what is the new birth their brother
[19:26] Brandon what is the new word it's the
[19:28] revelation of Jesus Christ personally to
[19:31] you amen see not you join the church you
[19:34] shook a hand you've done something
[19:35] different you said Acree you promised to
[19:38] live about color roofs but Christ the
[19:40] Bible he is the word that was revealed
[19:42] to you and no matter what anybody says
[19:45] what takes place
[19:47] it's Christ they where there's pastor
[19:49] priests where it might be
[19:50] it's Christ in you that is the
[19:52] revelation that the church was built to
[19:54] phone all right so what is the numeric
[19:57] right around
[19:58] it's the revelation of Jesus Christ
[19:59] personally to you it's not the
[20:02] revelation of Jesus Christ to brother
[20:04] Branham that won't burn you
[20:10] it's the revelation of Jesus Christ
[20:11] personally to using the matter alright
[20:14] now we're gonna make a statement I
[20:16] supposed to vote this afternoon pastor
[20:18] so you decide to throw me out if you
[20:20] like to but I'm like this I don't
[20:26] believe and I said a little bit about it
[20:28] Wednesday night
[20:28] Paul said follow me as I follow Christ
[20:31] all right now we're not going beyond
[20:34] brother branham Holly and I were talking
[20:36] about it discussing it we're not in the
[20:39] days and say like a lot of things we've
[20:40] gone beyond brother Brown now we're
[20:44] gonna take a change of the body that he
[20:45] did tonight all right
[20:47] we're going to manifest some things that
[20:49] he didn't make manifest but we're not
[20:52] going beyond him come run around never
[20:54] went beyond Paul other than the opening
[20:58] of the fundament of the same work all
[21:00] right now so there was a time that we
[21:04] were leaning upon following brother
[21:06] Branham right then we see that run
[21:09] around introduced the fivefold ministry
[21:11] she's supposed to take any carried on I
[21:13] didn't say these things he did all right
[21:16] whether you think I'm part of it or not
[21:17] that's none of my business forget it you
[21:20] just do what you want to huh but see
[21:24] there's a time thing we don't just say
[21:26] when we followed run around who said we
[21:28] follow Christ that was in Paul Christ
[21:32] that was in leader Christ that was in
[21:34] John Christ that was in brother Branham
[21:36] all right now we say we follow the
[21:40] Christ in the fivefold ministry to carry
[21:42] something right and I'm just as honest
[21:45] as I can be
[21:46] if I pass off today standing right here
[21:49] and I don't cabbage down on what talk
[21:54] you don't want to say in their searches
[21:56] are do it when the pastor teaches them
[21:58] up to a point then they don't never get
[22:00] them another pastor really officially
[22:02] they just kind of let somebody print you
[22:04] a little bit but if you don't line up
[22:06] with what
[22:07] brother so-and-so had talked he gets put
[22:10] out and they give him another one will
[22:12] heaven the hell something happens to
[22:14] make sure the tapes and the planes
[22:16] retire but what I thought that I believe
[22:19] run around common and we have walk run
[22:21] around the top to check it out with but
[22:24] take the message personally to you and
[22:26] continue home get you a pastor and
[22:29] rattle it behind that pastor and don't
[22:32] this one brother Valens a silent leader
[22:35] you're really like I told you the
[22:39] brother city code in California right
[22:40] here to follow the Lula finances that's
[22:42] where you messed up ain't no Lula
[22:44] thought they same thing you think your
[22:47] teeth and I'm gonna be around here to a
[22:49] change sure you yourself can't fine we
[22:52] know what rudder they'll talk if it's
[22:54] the truth of what run around talk that's
[22:56] fine but get you a faster and continue
[22:59] home to the change of the body they need
[23:02] to pull me out of the ground okay could
[23:05] it be done and you rally around me then
[23:07] me you both will be in the grande all
[23:10] right that's just the way I talk you
[23:14] want money and that's the way I believed
[23:16] it all right but I see I believe the new
[23:19] birth is exactly what run around see
[23:21] Christ revealed in you not in me whether
[23:26] or not I'm born again has nothing to do
[23:28] with your experience I this whether or
[23:30] not you're 49 is whether or not you see
[23:34] Jesus Christ written on the internet and
[23:36] Jesus Christ is the word then he goes on
[23:39] I gave it to you from Pat much the
[23:41] 1960 1204 leading the service paragraph
[23:44] 71 the only way you can ever be saved is
[23:47] my revelation you're not safe push out
[23:51] here I said but speaking in tongue I'll
[23:53] make that money that's what you do after
[23:56] the baby right you get the baby you
[23:59] socket life is there the baby then it
[24:01] Crouch then it speaks in tongues in each
[24:04] house but that's not the life the life
[24:08] is not the shout and speaking it's done
[24:09] that's a
[24:10] attribute of the lock all right so they
[24:13] can only be saved by revelation you
[24:15] can't be saved by anything else all
[24:18] right
[24:20] then read around says what now who
[24:24] message home what shall we do with Jesus
[24:26] called the Christ 1964 1:26 leading the
[24:29] service he said you say you talking
[24:32] about believe it he said the devil
[24:33] village
[24:34] he said Wesley shouted found daddy you
[24:38] know but he found that he didn't pay the
[24:40] call said speaking in tongues and you
[24:42] got it they didn't Christian side said
[24:45] the love you got fruits and spirit but
[24:46] they have they denied the divinity I'm
[24:50] Jesus Christ what is the evidence with
[24:52] that spirit that's in you then punctuate
[24:55] Everitt promise whether they man and god
[24:59] will confirm it now listen to things and
[25:03] God will confirm it he said that's
[25:06] exactly the way it was with Jesus Christ
[25:11] nothing exactly let love is Jesus Christ
[25:13] your experience all right didn't you
[25:17] call the fruits of the spirit he goes on
[25:18] to say the fruits of the spirit is
[25:21] wonderful but the kind of reach that
[25:23] fruits of the spirit that's right more
[25:25] than Jesus that drove them out of the
[25:27] temple honey then the only true evidence
[25:30] is your Christian is whether or not you
[25:33] can accept the word now I like the way
[25:37] he said it whether or not the spirit in
[25:39] you agrees then say agreed honey
[25:44] disagrees with the word me because that
[25:48] way then you continue it it does you see
[25:52] people come in the message and they stay
[25:54] a while and all they want something
[25:56] comes up and they're gone
[26:02] well label it is ugly and they leave
[26:05] blazing right no somebody corn was able
[26:11] to do right they believe oh yeah I
[26:14] believe everything right around said
[26:17] well where are you in the door oh well I
[26:19] don't believe it going to church well
[26:22] then that's forsaking the assembling of
[26:23] yourselves together and that's what
[26:24] Jesus citizen okay no problem
[26:27] that's right yeah but then we went on to
[26:29] cover what is the evidence of a believer
[26:32] that's taken from when your eyes were
[26:34] open they um 64 for 16 paragraph 126 but
[26:39] what is the evidence of a believer that
[26:42] will but believes that identified word
[26:44] of the hour it's always been that way
[26:50] they said it's always been that way the
[26:53] people get it frequent up and all kind
[26:55] of traditions and religious religions
[26:57] and denominations and educational work
[26:59] but God comes along with his word to
[27:01] confirm it for an hour that's the
[27:04] evidence when God confirms you all right
[27:07] if we don't come and we take a change of
[27:09] the body come on grace then evidently he
[27:16] was wrong I like what brother round said
[27:19] he said the bride people have heard of
[27:23] even say I don't need no vindication
[27:25] brother Branham with men decayed my
[27:27] father a vindicated Mason okay you
[27:29] weren't wonderful little Rama said the
[27:32] bride would vindicate somebody's gotta
[27:35] take the chain to the body that's why
[27:39] the people are look waiting for brother
[27:41] Branham to return right and in the
[27:43] return ministry since I because they're
[27:47] not certain about what they've got no
[27:50] they've gotta have some form to hold on
[27:52] to and I told you what I've said about
[27:55] no thing you can come back at breaks to
[27:58] us with salvation gonna be over with
[28:01] you don't get saved after he comes back
[28:03] they're gonna be 30 40 days they need to
[28:06] be here yet right but how long would it
[28:09] take him to straighten out all these
[28:11] doctrines Oh Nathe about the evidence of
[28:13] the Holy Ghost so we went on to the next
[28:17] one who were on broken sister 1964 he's
[28:21] covering the paragraph 66 through 68
[28:25] that brother Brandon says what he said
[28:29] that he was talking real email about it
[28:31] and said they talked about it and he
[28:33] first thought that it was love and he
[28:35] said I would hold on to that he said
[28:37] that sounded pretty good so I just held
[28:39] that if a man's not love but one day the
[28:42] Lord in Ephesians straighten me out he
[28:45] said that the evidence of the Spirit
[28:47] with those who could receive the word
[28:50] mustnít
[28:51] neither love are speaking in tongues but
[28:57] it's receiving the word he goes on to
[29:02] down sentences so the genuine evidence
[29:04] the Holy Ghost he has never told me
[29:06] anything wrong never that's the Holy
[29:08] Ghost today is he who can believe the
[29:11] word then you can receive it but when
[29:15] the Holy Ghost is come the Jesus never
[29:18] said listen to Bryn Renner Jesus never
[29:21] said when the Holy Ghost has come you
[29:22] speak in tongues
[29:23] he never said when I wanna go says come
[29:25] you do any of those things he said you
[29:28] pay though these things of mine and show
[29:31] them to you and we'll show you things
[29:34] that is to come so there is the genuine
[29:36] evidence of the Holy Ghost according to
[29:39] Jesus himself now that he don't change
[29:43] nobody this got their heart set on that
[29:47] I spoke in tongues when I got that
[29:49] and I'm not gonna argue with nobody to
[29:52] tell you he did I'm just gonna tell you
[29:57] to make sure cuz that's what the Bible
[29:59] said the Bible says make your calling
[30:04] and election sure that's what I've
[30:08] always said
[30:09] one thousand four ladies three more to
[30:10] go we hum towns to quote this I draw
[30:13] their seat guard all my life find out I
[30:16] had it then the Nazi guard and find out
[30:19] I didn't have it so you're looking at
[30:22] one feller the internet or wherever you
[30:24] look you look at one that seats thought
[30:25] every day I want to continual experience
[30:29] with my Savior matters yeah man I'm it
[30:33] sometimes it gets kind of dry because he
[30:35] doesn't train babies like we do he don't
[30:38] tell us sometimes he kind of lets us run
[30:41] a little bit over a woman you know I
[30:42] don't mean that wrongly now but he just
[30:44] had backs away from us with his presence
[30:47] but what does that matter
[30:49] am i Christians be called I shout no I
[30:51] have my Christian Carter speaking done
[30:53] no am i Christian with God I'd say
[30:55] everyday I feel this pressure if that's
[31:00] what's your face don't you're gonna find
[31:02] really Dale saving in the devil's diet
[31:04] and you're gonna need okay you're gonna
[31:07] get a date you don't feel like then when
[31:09] you come in you don't get a day when you
[31:12] don't feel like shopping you don't feel
[31:14] that crying you don't feel like you but
[31:16] what are you gonna do right you won't
[31:19] say you lost no I'm gonna say God said
[31:22] it I believe it and that's it alright so
[31:29] we went on with the questions of masters
[31:31] 1964 8:23 Heath and paragraph 2 12 when
[31:35] the Holy Ghost is come let's see the
[31:38] question what is the evidence that a
[31:39] person that's truly filled with only
[31:41] hood that was the question John 14:26
[31:45] one would read when the Holy Ghost is
[31:48] coming show you these things
[31:50] the hill perfected man mates won't do it
[31:56] he is the work when he the Holy Ghost is
[31:58] come he will identify accepting you with
[32:00] a scripture and that is the true sign
[32:02] that the Holy Spirit is in you because
[32:04] it is the word me you don't have to
[32:08] prove nothing you let God prove it you
[32:13] stay with a word you have a brother Dale
[32:14] caller I'm sorry Lulu you've been work
[32:17] work work work we're not alone were you
[32:19] me we ain't got nothing but the work so
[32:25] we got work soon hi networks read at
[32:29] least we got something forgot to follow
[32:31] right where are you at 56 and salmon all
[32:35] over the land you know and let's don't
[32:37] get into the deep we still get into
[32:39] these time we might get confused now you
[32:42] know get in finish you born confuse your
[32:46] already confused
[32:47] let's tell you with the simple things
[32:49] now have another because we'll we'll
[32:51] work our way away from okay after 47
[32:58] years of studying one man you were to
[33:02] know a little bit of that much profits
[33:05] I've talked about somebody went down bad
[33:07] and they said well I don't know where he
[33:09] said it I said hold on when I get my
[33:10] computer running come on computer my
[33:13] brain telling me and if my computer my
[33:15] brain is not right you tell me if you
[33:18] won't wait long enough for me to run up
[33:19] the computer to either that exact page
[33:21] number you just come and show me you
[33:24] know how was that my computer in my
[33:26] brain is working and I wouldn't afraid
[33:29] why for 40 years of steady tone I mean I
[33:32] have to 40 years lower what you gonna
[33:34] want food
[33:35] [Music]
[33:37] my niece he'd always get up everyone and
[33:40] she put her shoes on Mike Megan tell me
[33:42] to every woman you know and she was 30
[33:45] years oh he's automatic he is he's
[33:49] mended 20 and always flirts you don't
[33:51] George me you like me but now this
[33:57] seriously seriously as we can be about
[34:02] it we're not down here in the end time
[34:05] to just play around we're right here
[34:10] to how a revelation of Jesus cried to
[34:15] were that we can stand the times the
[34:18] troubles and the problems and I know a
[34:22] lot of people you know and some of you
[34:24] listening out there on the internet and
[34:26] funny would differ but I've never
[34:29] preached that we going through
[34:30] tribulation no but I preached thought I
[34:33] believe what the prophets did the Bible
[34:36] said tribulation worketh patience they
[34:38] went through a pre tribulation and
[34:41] that's what he calls it pre tribulation
[34:43] two relations wrath of God the right of
[34:45] crisis not that but we've got a
[34:47] persecution ahead of us and I hope and
[34:50] pray that I'm wrong about the statements
[34:53] that even awesomer say we would be
[34:55] physically bereft people say that's only
[34:58] for the foolish virgins well okay
[35:00] then he says it right now so that's
[35:02] that's when you and them but I'm not
[35:04] I've never been adduced a preacher I've
[35:08] never been that I've been one up to the
[35:10] basis that if they come in here today to
[35:12] close the doors then we know for sure
[35:14] they're after right I mean that is one
[35:18] sign if they come in and try to close
[35:19] does that mean we bet we start up enough
[35:21] to your offices for something to happen
[35:24] all right so then we'll follow whatever
[35:27] God says and then read said we're not
[35:31] going through on the fire of a leaves
[35:35] fail to see usually known yoga life
[35:36] inside I'm not counting on giving my
[35:39] life for the gospel because that's what
[35:41] God wants then let God take care of what
[35:44] it is I've never been that Doomsday form
[35:47] but I believe what he's saying and the
[35:49] point of it is is what's going to happen
[35:51] he found if you're right then I'm going
[35:54] to glory that we didn't have to go
[35:55] through it all right I'm gonna lure II
[35:59] did we didn't have no persecution all
[36:01] right but if I'm right and believe that
[36:05] the Prophet said we do have some
[36:07] persecution to go through it your
[36:10] tongues don't be stuck to the Ruth you
[36:11] mouth when things start happening and
[36:14] you wind up in jail for what you preach
[36:16] I see are you gonna change them are you
[36:24] gonna say well how much the always
[36:25] coming even if I missed it because it
[36:27] you're saying that the foolish virgins
[36:28] on one going through that so if you're
[36:31] saying the foolish murder no one going
[36:32] through it and then you start going awry
[36:34] start going through it then we will be
[36:35] fully perfect is it sexual right see
[36:38] that's why I get into trouble I make
[36:40] every bank money you think we don't want
[36:44] to talk with me about that - my client
[36:46] will not be fine I mean why why not be
[36:52] you know and that's why we tell the
[36:54] devil when I pray for somebody if you
[36:55] don't show us how they didn't you nice I
[36:58] just wish the demons hanging around on
[37:00] the boy because if they didn't need it
[37:04] we still got it but if they did need it
[37:08] you it bro
[37:09] I talked to him you don't have talked to
[37:11] Bill no I never talked to them well
[37:14] maybe that's cuz you're too much
[37:16] happening
[37:20] you know you don't call fury no no we do
[37:23] naturally but you know what say if we
[37:26] are of the devil then we wouldn't talk
[37:28] to the devil because we are the devil
[37:30] we're talking to the devil at least it
[37:33] means he ain't got me yeah I like what
[37:35] the man said you know when he's going
[37:37] down the road and this man go inside a
[37:38] road they taught it it's the hey jokes
[37:40] it like you that depend of them did I'm
[37:44] over here he said ain't God yes don't
[37:49] you understand I'm telling I'm the devil
[37:50] over here he said I didn't know you're
[37:51] that far away from me so unless
[37:56] computers to their art let's get into
[37:58] the thought for the day because it is
[38:01] titled if we title the last when the
[38:03] birth of the work we're just time of
[38:05] this to finish up as the true evidence
[38:10] the true evidence of whether you're born
[38:13] again or not see can we be corrected if
[38:24] we can't be corrected they might talk
[38:26] about an evidence you can't receive
[38:29] correction and the Bible says were
[38:32] bastard that's made you it's not always
[38:37] told everybody
[38:39] tell me show me where I'm off to work
[38:42] there are lives we have problems with
[38:44] human for everybody in a different body
[38:48] in a different way of doing things
[38:49] review life you know but now in the word
[38:53] coming showing we're off to work
[38:58] so the true evidence is one who can
[39:01] receive the word keep on receiving the
[39:06] word never stop receiving the word and
[39:09] believe that word
[39:12] he never said you'd speak in tongue
[39:14] dream thing like that
[39:15] said when the Holy Ghost would come he
[39:18] would do that and even show you things
[39:20] the
[39:21] comment that's what we read every screw
[39:24] dammit
[39:25] alright so now watch when we get down to
[39:27] that in a minute what Brett around says
[39:29] about it well the point is though well
[39:33] let's read it right man okay number one
[39:35] that's fine let's read what brother
[39:38] round had to say that summer nature
[39:39] chain which is 140 of the church age
[39:42] book it works at all right so look what
[39:46] he says now you can begin to see why
[39:51] tongues is not the evidence of being
[39:52] baptized with the Holy Spirit it doesn't
[39:54] say in any age that he that had the
[39:58] tunnel they didn't say what the Spirit
[39:59] is safe don't say that now watch what he
[40:03] says it saved me
[40:05] that puts tongues interpretation thereof
[40:08] and prophecy so forth
[40:11] aside as an evidence the evidence is
[40:15] hearing what the spirits say the spirit
[40:18] is talking yes the spirit is teaching
[40:20] that exactly what Jesus said he would do
[40:24] when he came in John 14:26 he would
[40:26] teach you all things and bring to your
[40:29] remembrance whatsoever I have said unto
[40:31] you and that is just what happened that
[40:36] is how the Gospels were written right
[40:41] they don't like the Gospels right
[40:43] Matthew Mark Luke and John and then the
[40:46] Peter in all of the different room the
[40:48] things we call the gosh so look what he
[40:50] say how's he saying the apostle of the
[40:54] the gospel to written not i speaking in
[40:58] tongues not even by prophecy but by what
[41:03] by the spirit talking and telling you
[41:09] see you'll see in a minute maybe in this
[41:12] one but works it and you know it says
[41:14] that the ever church age it says the
[41:16] spirit he they hear what the Spirit has
[41:19] to say all right it's always been that
[41:21] way
[41:21] and watch what he said man and that is
[41:24] what happened that is how the Gospels
[41:26] were written these men had recalled
[41:28] through their
[41:29] by the Holy Ghost the very words that
[41:32] Jesus faith and look at even Peter
[41:36] I mean Oh Luke and what is you Luke and
[41:40] Mark is that right we're not original to
[41:42] something huh and Luke's it I don't want
[41:45] to sit have a perfect understanding he's
[41:47] ready so yeah here watch somebody else
[41:50] say it with the Holy Spirit and
[41:52] equipment if you understood me following
[41:53] me my point that is one of the Gospels
[42:00] are accurate they're perfect but the
[42:03] Spirit did not only bring all things to
[42:06] their minds we taught them further on
[42:09] the truth they already had but I don't
[42:14] see any be taught in federal Putin
[42:15] already had reading that's worse that is
[42:23] how Paul received this revelation
[42:30] Paul never went to the disciples to get
[42:33] it right he went myself right so that's
[42:38] what he saved all right Paul received
[42:43] his revelation he said concerning when I
[42:46] certify you brethren that the gospel
[42:47] which was preached of me is not after
[42:49] men for I neither received it of man
[42:53] neither was I taught it of man but by
[42:56] the revelation of Jesus Christ Galatians
[42:58] one level where he was talked about the
[43:01] Holy Spirit Holy Ghost all right going
[43:08] down now to skip the next paragraph you
[43:10] can read it the Queen put them around
[43:11] 140 or placed 141 come up to the next
[43:19] letter to talk to the right and to every
[43:24] age we hear the same truth even happen
[43:29] here they didn't hear what the Spirit
[43:31] says to the churches never speaking to
[43:34] other thoughts in truth but only a
[43:37] spirit filled man can hear the
[43:39] revelation for that age none of the can
[43:42] no sir they cannot become that is
[43:45] exactly what Paul said in first
[43:48] Corinthians two and six
[43:51] I mean in every age now listen you
[43:56] remember the other day when I was trying
[43:58] to explain that every type of baptism I
[44:00] would go there right now watch it in
[44:02] every age and every age is the age of
[44:06] the Holy Ghost for the true believer I
[44:08] say in every age the evidence was the
[44:12] same
[44:13] now that should do away with Tom's
[44:16] interpretations of seeing visions or
[44:19] crying or shouting or anything whose
[44:23] evidence right
[44:27] come on solve it in your own mind look
[44:30] those are that the spirit the teacher
[44:33] heard the word and that spirit in them
[44:35] took the word and taught it revealed it
[44:37] to them and they were of the group that
[44:39] heard the messenger and he is messy and
[44:42] poopy in the every age and every age is
[44:50] the age of the Holy Spirit for the
[44:52] believer so everybody concedes the same
[44:55] new birth which is eternal life coming
[45:01] into you that's the new murder no matter
[45:05] what age you see him it's that a never
[45:07] age is not the sign that the ditch it's
[45:11] whether or not the spirit in you with
[45:12] agreed with whoever sees this may not be
[45:18] hidden you too much than what you think
[45:20] about but what about those out there
[45:22] they'd never heard and get an
[45:25] opportunity to hear so they've been
[45:27] caller over life it was this or that or
[45:29] that or the other or whatever and now
[45:31] it's talk just believe the message
[45:36] leaving the message is fine if you have
[45:40] the new murder right but the new birth
[45:43] comes first because you cannot rapidly
[45:46] believe the message if you don't have
[45:50] the new birth right is that sensible
[45:52] that's right because he'll take of mine
[45:56] and show them believe I have scripture
[46:03] that's playing this that's blood but
[46:05] it's they're harmless the next which is
[46:10] page 164
[46:15] the word always comes to the truth a
[46:18] spirit-filled that is the evidence that
[46:20] he's filled with I'm going to go that is
[46:22] what Jesus said would be the evidence he
[46:24] said and I will pray the father and he
[46:26] will send you another comforter that he
[46:28] may abide with you forever and even the
[46:29] Spirit of Truth whom the world cannot
[46:31] receive now we know what truth is my
[46:34] word is truth did you notice that Jesus
[46:37] said that the world could not receive
[46:40] the Holy Ghost well in this verse I just
[46:44] read it neither could they receive the
[46:46] words why because the spirit and the
[46:49] word are one if you have the Holy Spirit
[46:52] as the prophets the word would come to
[46:56] you you would receive it John 14:26 did
[47:03] you appreciate it
[47:04] that's why when Paul received the
[47:08] baptism of the Holy Ghost he stayed with
[47:13] Peter and them for just a little bit
[47:14] brother then he went to himself and when
[47:19] he came back he was preaching the same
[47:22] identical Jesus Christ that Peter James
[47:26] and John and him were pretty and they
[47:28] said as Peter quoted it that Paul he's
[47:32] gone beyond us and understanding that he
[47:36] says things that are hard to be
[47:38] understood though that people were
[47:40] rational with it so that was doing it
[47:42] back now like always told you where Paul
[47:45] was committing one of those or what
[47:47] Philip does my immediate percentage the
[47:49] resurrection fight you know where they
[47:50] got the doctor from sitting and
[47:53] listening to Paul yeah but the guys
[47:57] perverted coach Paul which preaches the
[47:58] resurrection of Jesus Christ into our
[48:01] hearts and lives by the new birth right
[48:04] and they come out and they do the
[48:06] natural well come on in any difference
[48:09] in we the people would appear you know
[48:11] went up the worship to the Millennium
[48:13] one under the bridge to Jefferson worth
[48:15] of millennium well they got it from the
[48:19] prostate but they perverted what he said
[48:22] about it
[48:23] yep
[48:26] unless the next district the truth at
[48:28] all times right right and what see you
[48:35] let's go never the last part of that
[48:37] month is underneath yeah now I want you
[48:42] to know very carefully that Jesus did
[48:44] not say that the evidence of being
[48:45] baptized with the Holy Ghost is speaking
[48:47] in tongues interpreting prophesy
[48:49] shouting are shouting and action he said
[48:51] the evidence would be that you would be
[48:54] in the truth you would be in the Word of
[48:57] God for your age evidence has to do with
[49:00] receiving that word ok yeah let's be
[49:05] plain I wouldn't ask you a question and
[49:13] it's goes out on the internet of those
[49:15] who ask the genuine
[49:16] I mean you continually will allow or
[49:21] where you get a why are you listening to
[49:25] me
[49:33] you're saying when we do that right hey
[49:37] I'm done covered if I could also sing
[49:39] what if you do right so we're not
[49:42] building on what we're building on the
[49:44] word why do you come here why did you
[49:49] leave the other churches to come here I
[49:52] never went out there I after you might
[49:57] have been like sister Trudy was where
[49:59] somebody upset some page okay
[50:02] and I go up to preach with a certain
[50:04] brother and that's how many thing you
[50:07] know but she wanted me to do which say
[50:09] you know warmer me because I had my
[50:12] website warmer and then stood a woman
[50:14] you know but at least that got her call
[50:18] she's set here today been here 27 years
[50:21] why hit here I mean you all a lot closer
[50:26] to a lot of other jerky why don't you go
[50:30] play I mean it must be the call for the
[50:34] word given in now I surely that must
[50:40] have to do something about it work right
[50:45] all right and it thrills me that we've
[50:48] had incidents tonight and half of the
[50:50] word our youth would go to youth camp
[50:53] and people would say we know where you
[50:55] go to church in because of their talking
[51:01] and that's very elementary you very
[51:04] proud were you proud of the youth we had
[51:07] very proudly these are fat and those
[51:09] that are coming up so you'd say well
[51:12] brother Dale y'all were just work work
[51:14] work what why do you know I'm just
[51:20] honest and you know I just want to
[51:25] follow along don't you let's see I don't
[51:29] have time
[51:33] but now this evidence - evidence whether
[51:44] or not the spirit in you agrees from the
[51:46] work right continually green color hat
[51:51] that stops a green you know it's not how
[51:53] its period don't need interpreting
[51:55] that's just plain line with you know you
[51:59] said we're brother they allege the
[52:00] people that left here I've never said
[52:01] the people that let you have to work you
[52:03] may don't get me to say they hear what
[52:06] you say you ain't never heard me say
[52:08] they left to work some of you had said
[52:10] they left to work but I never said they
[52:12] left work because that's everybody's
[52:15] responsibility where he's going what
[52:16] you're doing it's not to try to fail the
[52:19] church just to try to bring about a rat
[52:22] try it event it pretend about it morning
[52:26] we can get out of here all right see
[52:28] then we're here to that point and I've
[52:30] always told you this it comes to a basis
[52:32] that you go somewhere that you find more
[52:34] what we're preaching here let me know
[52:36] then with your song will go comes out I
[52:40] want to be changed don't treat a man all
[52:43] right see there's a reason for us to be
[52:45] in here and evidently something about
[52:46] the word that we believe now if I don't
[52:50] get to it in a minute brother Brennan
[52:52] said in the church Facebook that he not
[52:54] only taught them we covered it back dark
[52:56] you know he taught them further on the
[53:00] revelation all right let me review that
[53:05] just a minute
[53:08] we I've talked you from the beginning
[53:10] we're based on what college did Peter in
[53:13] under shop with what Jesus did right but
[53:18] then it come down that we're based upon
[53:19] what brother Branham said now there were
[53:23] signs that brother Anderson had to be
[53:24] corrected but he had to create yourself
[53:26] right and he took it and it was done
[53:29] that was fine all right but the meat of
[53:32] the message never changed
[53:34] all right and so by doing that then the
[53:39] spirit that is within us is continually
[53:42] agreeing with the word right and walking
[53:46] him the word to come to a place and said
[53:49] would even teach them things to come and
[53:53] then we covered that Pete Paul even
[53:55] that's how he received his message was
[53:58] by the Holy Spirit out on the backside
[54:00] of the desert and no man teaching him
[54:02] but reading the scroll but now he didn't
[54:05] get born again without somebody first
[54:08] telling me you say he got knocked down
[54:11] on the road to Damascus he did but you
[54:15] don't call that your salvation you have
[54:16] to watch now because remember there was
[54:20] a man sent over are told his eyes see
[54:26] the big city you say well just natural
[54:27] well I believe the whole experience
[54:29] somewhere came because of what somebody
[54:31] said about you because that is the
[54:34] numerical earth of the word even though
[54:36] he was a prophet and he could receive
[54:39] the word and grow in the word he still
[54:42] had to hear the word from somebody to
[54:45] get his start okay now then why is the
[54:48] trouble with people the message that
[54:50] they don't see this bread around ever
[54:52] Toby Keith I'm differ but he took us
[54:55] further into the revelation you agree
[54:59] see it the sealed Oakland the things
[55:02] like that to the Prophet that were not
[55:05] preached by the disciples the son of man
[55:08] was never mentioned in any of the
[55:09] writings other than Matthew Mark Luke
[55:12] and John that were recorded but you
[55:15] don't hear Paul Peter and they may even
[55:16] speak another son of man in their
[55:20] writings now
[55:21] come on get what I said I said it is in
[55:23] Matthew Mark Luke and John II thought
[55:24] they were
[55:25] corner alright because they didn't
[55:28] understand it then run around it not the
[55:31] way the seals broke to start talking
[55:32] about the son of man because he had not
[55:35] only the understanding of the son of man
[55:37] he had to vindication that the son of
[55:41] man would be the resurrection because
[55:43] that was where Jesus had it in the
[55:46] resurrection and the things that even
[55:48] the sick the faith would be the son of
[55:50] man
[55:51] well is he any problem with believing
[55:52] that brother brown could take us on into
[55:56] deeper depths of the word it would take
[56:00] us all the way to be a change of the
[56:02] body Paul could prophesy of it who
[56:06] couldn't make it medicine my brother
[56:10] branham prophesied of it then maybe
[56:13] deeper deaths in Paul but he didn't make
[56:15] it many things but you're not gonna make
[56:19] it - somebody has to vindicate this may
[56:22] seem to be true to vindicate this Bible
[56:24] is being true what's the problem we're
[56:27] trying to go into the message then and
[56:29] understand the message well oh we don't
[56:33] want to get it confused mine aren't
[56:35] confused we don't want to get out now
[56:38] only on brother y'all read only most
[56:43] equals already little bits on top right
[56:48] we'll get to it a little bit this
[56:50] afternoon like some of these doctors
[56:52] when they come the doctors what happened
[56:56] 90% of the people that come up with an
[56:58] extra doctor comes up with an extra wife
[57:05] any problem no did I say it like it huh
[57:11] huh let's tell the truth about it what
[57:15] you see what we want to do is make sure
[57:19] that we know what the true evidences
[57:22] aren't Muslim we're guilty number 3 of
[57:25] the motor industry which is message of
[57:30] God 1962 1014 that evening
[57:35] man this 13th verse now watch a lot of
[57:38] this it won't deal with exactly evidence
[57:40] it sincerely was showing you the word
[57:43] comes to the individual right the
[57:47] evidence we've done cover is whether or
[57:49] not they can come to the individual and
[57:52] the only way can come to the individual
[57:54] get for it to be revealed I don't care
[57:56] how much you can say brother Brown said
[57:58] the Bible said no man can call Jesus the
[58:01] Christ except my personal new birth you
[58:05] say you change that no idea and that's
[58:06] what the Bible saying that night without
[58:08] a personal revelation personally to you
[58:10] and getting understand so what is he
[58:12] saying that is 13th verse idea when the
[58:14] spirit of truth is come he will guide
[58:16] you into all truth when the Spirit of
[58:18] Truth has come he will guide you into
[58:19] all truth when they through the word he
[58:23] shall speak he shall not speak of
[58:26] himself now if you know speaker they say
[58:30] who's he talking about the first God's
[58:34] not speaking of himself he's actually
[58:36] speaking of Jesus he's trying to get you
[58:39] to see who that is
[58:40] alright then secondly he's not Jesus and
[58:42] not speaking to simply speaking of you
[58:45] right let me come on then we can cover a
[58:47] lot of form right your truth you tell me
[58:50] guide you into all truth what is the
[58:52] truth the word for your speak he shall
[58:53] not speak of himself but what did years
[58:56] he'll speak what he hears he would speak
[58:58] in other words he lead the one that will
[59:00] reveal the thing you see and the fourth
[59:02] chapter of Hebrews the Bible said that
[59:04] the Word of God is sharper more
[59:07] then activated sort a discerner of the
[59:09] thoughts of the mind the heart see what
[59:14] he is he will speak and he will show you
[59:16] things to come see what's going to do
[59:19] that the holy spirit who will come in
[59:22] the name of the lord chief he's going to
[59:26] do those things for you and i all right
[59:29] look at the next one
[59:30] future home 1964 head over to the
[59:33] paragraph 195 now that's what we were
[59:37] talking the other day the evidence of
[59:39] the Holy Ghost see the evidence of the
[59:40] Holy Ghost is when you can receive the
[59:42] work not some system now that puts
[59:46] everything out right but how they clear
[59:49] understand now I check this to make sure
[59:53] but I knew it was we do these books that
[59:58] you do not have with Christ the mystery
[1:00:00] of God revealed in the first book it
[1:00:02] says understanding but when they came
[1:00:07] back to reprint the crash some history
[1:00:10] they watch them
[1:00:12] he said understand where the old one
[1:00:17] says understanding so evidently when
[1:00:21] they put it back in whatever they done
[1:00:23] through the computer system they
[1:00:24] couldn't understand which is the same
[1:00:26] word I'm just showing you in case you
[1:00:28] read your book and you see what they are
[1:00:29] not understanding brother they get that
[1:00:32] now I'm just tell me wine that it's dark
[1:00:34] they change that oh but how they clear
[1:00:38] understanding I mean how do you know the
[1:00:44] word is clear understand it once it
[1:00:49] vindicated set a clear understanding now
[1:00:56] you bring you what you how many of you
[1:00:58] want to say the rest of the evening to
[1:00:59] bring about the the adoptions to word it
[1:01:02] to brother Brandon we're talking about
[1:01:03] clear understanding having your mind
[1:01:05] unmodeled from life and people and walk
[1:01:10] in through the clear understanding of
[1:01:12] this message mark the evidence of the
[1:01:14] Holy Ghost is for you to have a clear
[1:01:17] understanding I don't offend out of it
[1:01:21] oh that is revealed to you is clear
[1:01:29] understanding whether it be water
[1:01:33] baptism one God to know eternal hell
[1:01:37] serpent seed etc it is clear
[1:01:40] understanding when it's revealed to you
[1:01:42] now man have muddled it all up with his
[1:01:49] interpretation because go back to what
[1:01:53] you say have a clear understanding go
[1:01:55] back to what we've been quoting how can
[1:01:58] you call Jesus Christ accepted me by the
[1:02:00] Holy Ghost how can you have a clear
[1:02:04] understanding this nation is not the
[1:02:05] holding up then we have a clear
[1:02:07] understanding this messy if the Holy
[1:02:09] Ghost don't use somebody to break it
[1:02:12] down for us
[1:02:15] you see what I'm talking about
[1:02:19] once we connect from the power of
[1:02:21] decision 1955 10 or 11 I like to go way
[1:02:24] up down because that way people say oh
[1:02:26] you know we own that home off we will
[1:02:29] only watch after the seal I like to take
[1:02:32] you back know maybe 55 you know God
[1:02:37] say these signs shall follow them that
[1:02:39] believe lay hands on the sick and they
[1:02:41] shall recover this is good land
[1:02:42] Joshua said it's a wonderful land Joshua
[1:02:44] and Caleb aren't you glad and this is a
[1:02:46] wonderful land I am a man Josh when
[1:02:50] Caleb brought back some initial evidence
[1:02:52] that they'd been over there somewhere
[1:02:55] now they brought back and everything
[1:02:58] right that's why people come in here try
[1:03:03] to preach this all kind of dr. right
[1:03:05] because they know for certainty they
[1:03:07] gonna get straight now
[1:03:09] I had a wonderful brother and I will
[1:03:13] call his name because they'll be left up
[1:03:14] to him to what he can do but her brother
[1:03:16] freaked something wrong here in this
[1:03:17] church and I was intended to talk to him
[1:03:19] and try to find you know get with it but
[1:03:21] I want to talk personal all right he
[1:03:24] found out through wait we didn't believe
[1:03:27] what do you say he called me up in the
[1:03:29] apologize what he said I said brother I
[1:03:33] think more of you than I ever had no but
[1:03:39] he didn't never say that he didn't agree
[1:03:41] with what was laying around earlier but
[1:03:43] it was the fact that he preached it here
[1:03:44] that we didn't agreement I think the
[1:03:47] world living penalty honor he wants to
[1:03:51] come to York straight then that's fine I
[1:03:52] don't need him after because we'd
[1:03:54] already straighten it out don't people
[1:03:56] who didn't believe it miss joseline
[1:03:59] Kayla brought back some initial evidence
[1:04:01] they take that over without some work
[1:04:03] I'm so glad than not that we got
[1:04:06] witnesses in the church tonight that's
[1:04:08] been somewhere and I'm talking the Lulla
[1:04:11] I'm glad we've got some in this church
[1:04:15] that's been some work and can tell us
[1:04:19] about it I love to hear your experience
[1:04:23] of what God's done with you
[1:04:26] I spent somewhere that's not something
[1:04:29] let's come back with the evidence that
[1:04:31] the Holy Ghost is just assigned tonight
[1:04:33] as it was the day it fell on pinnacle he
[1:04:38] said hallelujah as it did when it fell
[1:04:43] onto that pinnacle this for that matter
[1:04:47] artists time 1964 12 12 paragraph 158
[1:04:52] the jesus said when the spirit of truth
[1:04:54] is come see he will bring these things
[1:04:56] that I have talked to your memory the
[1:05:00] word and he'll also show you studies to
[1:05:02] come there is the regal spirit filled
[1:05:05] Church now
[1:05:06] stave what who want only the things
[1:05:09] tonight stays with the word reflects the
[1:05:13] word God on earth see he doesn't need
[1:05:16] any theologian poses word is of no
[1:05:19] private interpretation the interprets is
[1:05:22] onward by vindicating and proving it
[1:05:24] it's the truth when the Methodist Church
[1:05:27] told you you couldn't receive the Holy
[1:05:30] Ghost by they did on the day of
[1:05:32] Pentecost
[1:05:33] and when I tell you that I look like
[1:05:37] they're dealing with a pineco did you
[1:05:39] pay any attention to it
[1:05:42] certainly not you went right along and
[1:05:46] back the Holy Ghost anyhow we will cover
[1:05:50] this doctrine when we get time to think
[1:05:53] about what - no no Holy Ghost doctrine
[1:05:55] and the first church we were in has that
[1:05:57] doctrine and I told the pastor us that
[1:06:00] I'm not trying to prove you whether I'm
[1:06:02] born in or not
[1:06:03] I'm just trying to show you brother
[1:06:04] Brown was right brother Brad said he met
[1:06:07] people to receive the baptism of the
[1:06:09] Holy Ghost 50 years before him he said
[1:06:12] exactly like that in a comment well you
[1:06:16] know I told you about two brothers which
[1:06:18] that was one of them and another brother
[1:06:19] and then said in arguing with each other
[1:06:22] said they couldn't understand why we're
[1:06:23] around both no city couldn't understand
[1:06:25] why brother Branham said that statement
[1:06:27] well one of them believed that you
[1:06:29] didn't get nothing out of it and you
[1:06:31] just got converted the other one
[1:06:33] believed that when he got it the new
[1:06:34] birth you got to hit stuff I said
[1:06:36] there's somewhere in between you can
[1:06:38] guys they got to be a truth right cuz
[1:06:40] there's too much gap listen would you
[1:06:43] mind if I slain I explained that
[1:06:45] Pentecost the split experienced over 120
[1:06:48] in the upper room two or three and I
[1:06:50] hear the other one coming by a certain
[1:06:52] one mansion and they like me it's gone I
[1:06:54] saw okay you worry about it the least
[1:06:59] I've been between them somewhere so you
[1:07:02] know what people are you just an
[1:07:03] intellectual because you can explain
[1:07:10] well if I'm an intellectual called I
[1:07:12] explain brother Brennan what are you
[1:07:14] making brother rounded explained it to
[1:07:16] start with all right what do you make it
[1:07:23] is he just an intellectual I'm gonna use
[1:07:27] profit yeah okay we're we're if we think
[1:07:32] it's net from the harvester I still got
[1:07:37] one more on my graph type of progress
[1:07:40] 158 we jump over perfect 177 and we'll
[1:07:44] try to quit okay what's now and we hurry
[1:07:47] up true when the spirit of truth is come
[1:07:49] he will teach you all things whatever I
[1:07:51] taught you
[1:07:52] oh my bearing all remembrance to you
[1:07:57] what I stayed to you bringing to you all
[1:08:03] remembrance he will show you things to
[1:08:06] come
[1:08:06] he will vindicate every word confirming
[1:08:10] the word with signs following everything
[1:08:12] that he promised that God promised in
[1:08:15] the Bible if you'll turn loose from ever
[1:08:18] Creed and everything else and hold on to
[1:08:20] the word God is obligated to take care
[1:08:23] of his word so when they did this the
[1:08:26] word indicates this thing I know that to
[1:08:30] be the truth because I've experienced it
[1:08:34] I preached to seal here in 1981 and 82
[1:08:42] 82 83 I had preached them in 79 didn't
[1:08:47] feel right I come on in there when I
[1:08:49] preached it I asked garnish the dog will
[1:08:51] you do something to show me
[1:08:55] I'm not gonna mention it nobody this is
[1:08:59] on record true you don't happen not
[1:09:01] gonna mention this to nobody at the end
[1:09:05] of the series when we get through that
[1:09:06] when I asked him and he got healed in
[1:09:08] the series not by us having to pray far
[1:09:11] but by the Lord just to live
[1:09:14] and we had a wonderful raise of hands to
[1:09:19] see people that were delivered but I
[1:09:21] believe the word will deliver I believe
[1:09:24] healing is in order I believe salvation
[1:09:27] that is the word is in it when it's not
[1:09:29] available so when it's revealed to us
[1:09:33] then it'll be good so what is the true
[1:09:37] have an inch the true evidence is
[1:09:40] whether or not spirit in you continually
[1:09:43] will agree with that word and let God
[1:09:46] vindicate it out that's right well we
[1:09:50] just don't see much vindication you
[1:09:53] realize you sitting here today is a
[1:09:55] vindication you want me to keep on
[1:09:57] preaching what I started while ago see
[1:09:58] everybody thinks that exalts main
[1:10:00] announcer you need to continue on that
[1:10:03] point why are you here you know to me
[1:10:07] that's an evidence other churches are
[1:10:11] ending up doing things splits and all
[1:10:13] combine and we're just growing and
[1:10:16] wondering where we're going what we
[1:10:17] don't do when the few people feeling up
[1:10:19] because they keep coming in man but
[1:10:24] could it be the fact that I stood here
[1:10:26] years ago and I said they'll come a time
[1:10:27] my wife didn't indicated even though the
[1:10:30] tapes Mac Mary got I said there'll be a
[1:10:32] time when those that went away
[1:10:34] will come back and I had personally
[1:10:39] brother dong kyun on my man and he went
[1:10:42] away but did he came back
[1:10:47] could I go tell him no no you gotta come
[1:10:52] back only so it would be Radley run out
[1:10:55] till whoops weirdness glad tell the
[1:10:56] people are you coming October Robert

[1:11:11] you about how that he's so mad at us
[1:11:13] appear ain't gonna do it
[1:11:14] I still believe you'll be here but I'd
[1:11:19] ride down the road seen him iron
[1:11:21] enforcer just go back till he got come
[1:11:22] on told Joyce Danny would be here till
[1:11:29] June laughs then waited they hear it
[1:11:31] beep recently why can't we believe God
[1:11:34] has indicated his word how long can we
[1:11:40] stay in the trunk of her personal
[1:11:41] experience of what has happened being
[1:11:44] only the opening of the word what about
[1:11:48] what is the true evidence shouting you
[1:11:54] think about it now will shouting the
[1:11:59] thing like that holds you when the guns
[1:12:00] at you now would shouting then I'm not
[1:12:04] against it I believe in it I've even
[1:12:09] told you about smelling the presence of
[1:12:11] God when he'd be so close to it and I
[1:12:12] literally smelling most wonderful odor
[1:12:15] you've ever smelled in your life I had
[1:12:18] to speak to me personally singing see my
[1:12:22] angel reformed in my house three times I
[1:12:25] don't have to back up for nobody those
[1:12:27] are the truth they don't take for 40
[1:12:29] years but listen if we don't continue on
[1:12:33] with the word we're going by the crisis
[1:12:38] brother now used to we'd get together
[1:12:40] Nate we'd hear about somebody preaching
[1:12:42] and everybody saying he's off the word
[1:12:44] he's off the mansion you like some guy
[1:12:46] we like to listen to go come find out
[1:12:49] 90% of town they were more on the word
[1:12:51] than one
[1:12:52] tendinous that's true we go find out
[1:12:56] every morning to work
[1:12:58] what's the art truth will take those out
[1:13:00] of here in ten mark truth will reserve
[1:13:05] us a place in glory for eternity in the
[1:13:09] Bride of Christ the part truth will not
[1:13:12] take a chain somebody's going to walk
[1:13:15] off this earth at least let me not get
[1:13:19] in the way
[1:13:20] plenty encourage you to seek God
[1:13:26] brother Dale you start seeking God and
[1:13:29] I'm not the ones that tell you to open
[1:13:31] up your mind to be blind man I don't say
[1:13:33] that that's what you do you don't mind a
[1:13:37] big blank and their spirits don't come
[1:13:38] in and yell okay it's gonna get you know
[1:13:41] you keep your mind on God pray for him
[1:13:45] to reveal the word to you cuz I retrieve
[1:13:48] evidence whether or not that spirit
[1:13:50] keeps on agreed and there's in those
[1:13:55] seals in 92 and 83 and so I've never
[1:13:58] chose to read preach verbally all of
[1:14:00] them back over but before I started it I
[1:14:03] like the quote the brother Rhetta says
[1:14:06] you can't understand the seals if you
[1:14:07] don't understand that you've seventy
[1:14:09] weeks but everybody says they understand
[1:14:11] 1971 but why can't you preach to see are
[1:14:15] they preach the seals and don't
[1:14:17] understand that you're 70 now they would
[1:14:19] what do you say so we had to go step by
[1:14:22] step and it still stands today what I
[1:14:26] said in 1974 and Daniel seventy weeks
[1:14:29] even to the basis that we could pass the
[1:14:31] year 20 2026 and it wouldn't change me I
[1:14:35] said they're not he said before where I
[1:14:37] say today we could go to the year we
[1:14:40] could go to the year 5000 and it
[1:14:42] wouldn't break by transmissions why
[1:14:46] because we enter determining teeth seven
[1:14:51] seven is 49 but 250th is eternity
[1:14:55] could we go be alive that happened right
[1:14:59] right but you know if that's what God
[1:15:02] saw that's what's gonna take place so if
[1:15:06] I go down don't write on my tombstone he
[1:15:09] died not believe so he at least
[1:15:12] prophesied of what would take place
[1:15:16] could I believe they'll be exchanged in
[1:15:19] a moment between the other night and
[1:15:20] that's just kind of one question and I
[1:15:21] get this is brother Dale
[1:15:24] you said Sunday one twin out of the
[1:15:27] cliff you know your 2012 that when our
[1:15:31] bodies are changed the world has got to
[1:15:34] follow could you please explain that our
[1:15:39] bodies came out of this earth when Jesus
[1:15:42] dropped his blood on this earth he
[1:15:46] cleansed and claimed this earth one day
[1:15:49] this earth will be made eternal honey
[1:15:52] then my body was laying in that her so
[1:15:55] my body's already been clean sand client
[1:15:57] and the show he was right he gave me the
[1:16:01] baptism and hold it up they put it in my
[1:16:04] soul to show me that I find he gave me
[1:16:08] the new birth see then that claims the
[1:16:12] rest of it toward I'm just waiting for a
[1:16:14] change when he won't consent to see our
[1:16:20] bodies were in this world and when Jesus
[1:16:22] claimed that but see we step ahead
[1:16:26] that's the key that's always been
[1:16:29] seemingly that people couldn't follow we
[1:16:32] step ahead of the world right we were to
[1:16:38] gain their soul here the world is
[1:16:41] renamed later right go through the clean
[1:16:45] sand claim back there I just got to
[1:16:46] follow if your body was in that earth
[1:16:48] you're not gonna give in your body but
[1:16:51] I've always tried to show you that you
[1:16:52] don't get a new body you gotta get off
[1:16:53] Mars or flipped over
[1:16:56] it's a clutter and come find that at all
[1:16:59] comes with one mass the weight of this
[1:17:03] body you want to be the new one
[1:17:05] who is this body regained have another
[1:17:09] brand America ho no future homes it
[1:17:11] talking about Jesus and said from this
[1:17:13] part of the earth I have regained his
[1:17:16] body and I will retain the rest
[1:17:18] I thought his body was part of the earth
[1:17:21] cassette till then I see and I see that
[1:17:25] that within us is the new birth
[1:17:26] how can he throw this away so one day
[1:17:30] he's going to change it and make it
[1:17:32] eternal why because it's already been
[1:17:35] clean some claim man you birth came in
[1:17:39] you see we won't quote the scriptures
[1:17:41] and we say when it says please that the
[1:17:43] whale call my Jesus would you know when
[1:17:45] he gave you the new birth these pleased
[1:17:46] to dwell in ya pleased to dwell in you
[1:17:50] relents it please the honor your word
[1:17:55] we're not looking for a new body is this
[1:17:58] body redeemed of the earth is reading
[1:18:00] about it's just waiting it's just
[1:18:04] waiting one of the matter if it's a
[1:18:08] meeting years from that would make a
[1:18:11] difference
[1:18:13] everybody got eight times in season nine
[1:18:16] ten they have time and I was not one day
[1:18:20] learn this woman I said those things and
[1:18:21] nothing said before I wouldn't want this
[1:18:24] thing to happen the way that he is to
[1:18:26] come up here to 2012 no I wouldn't want
[1:18:29] it I sure want it come on up quicker and
[1:18:32] I was believing it we come quicker but I
[1:18:35] would just show it it could be done well
[1:18:38] you don't want a God on his way to do
[1:18:40] away with all cops and shadows right and
[1:18:43] I'm glad that although we went to this
[1:18:46] the seventy three and a half maybe four
[1:18:49] and a half seventy sevens the eighties
[1:18:52] the 88 mm and not even think he's a
[1:18:59] Bible said it in the third day he would
[1:19:05] cut it play
[1:19:06] the dirt thousand you know what we're in
[1:19:09] the third passenger okay we started in
[1:19:13] that when he went up five to two
[1:19:15] thousand so then we will be sitting in
[1:19:19] the word waiting I'm going to make it
[1:19:20] Madison we don't need to vindicate or we
[1:19:25] got about ten minutes if I got quick
[1:19:29] call me it felt whatever
[1:19:39] what do you think the new Berkeley not
[1:19:46] sure able that I would never in any way
[1:19:50] discourage you from thinking that you're
[1:19:54] born again but I must quote the other
[1:19:59] side it would be the greatest thing in
[1:20:03] the world that could happen to you or me
[1:20:06] just to find out that we're not truly
[1:20:09] born again you know one told me to do
[1:20:12] something back so on one side it would
[1:20:17] be a same thing but on the other side of
[1:20:18] I wouldn't back up from trying to punch
[1:20:21] recruit for us to see the truth kind of
[1:20:25] true sophistical nobody knows it
[1:20:34] what's this seen in worship a moment now
[1:20:40] we I don't know why I said is what I
[1:20:42] going on but I think I'd be in the Bible
[1:20:46] study last night was on tithing and if
[1:20:48] any of you want a copy of what we talked
[1:20:50] about brother Joe in them I believe can
[1:20:52] take it down off with the thing and all
[1:20:55] the word that if you want that then you
[1:20:57] can do it you know we you know have some
[1:21:00] understanding we also have a good many
[1:21:02] quotes back turning them up a briefcase
[1:21:03] the way it's got a bunch if you want to
[1:21:05] be playful tree just running tithing in
[1:21:08] your in your Bible and you think timing
[1:21:10] is how to say this letter you think it's
[1:21:12] better paying 10%
[1:21:13] you know there's in the Old Testament
[1:21:16] I've got it out of the concordance with
[1:21:20] the scriptures to back it up in the Old
[1:21:23] Testament tithing amounted to twenty
[1:21:26] three point at one-third never sinned
[1:21:35] cuz they had tied on time and they took
[1:21:40] up ties for doing this and they took up
[1:21:43] ties and fed the widows north you said
[1:21:45] honey well Bible place and that in fact
[1:21:50] they would we say 10 percent brother
[1:21:56] brown flip any true Christian will pay
[1:21:58] path which then he said and we gave the
[1:22:02] quotes he said brother Bradley can a
[1:22:05] person go to heaven don't pay time he
[1:22:07] said I don't know but I'll tell you in
[1:22:10] his commandment then we talked about
[1:22:15] whether or not if you pay off the grocer
[1:22:17] you pay off the the you know the whole
[1:22:20] top the end or you pay after taxes well
[1:22:23] I just made one simple point that would
[1:22:27] say well I just pay after taxes okay and
[1:22:30] then you go down and you get the company
[1:22:33] you're working and you put down zero
[1:22:36] dependents
[1:22:38] where they'll take out a bunch of you is
[1:22:40] called taxes and you think you did not
[1:22:42] fail math with the end of the year when
[1:22:45] you file your income tax you put where
[1:22:47] would Bob be just as an example he put
[1:22:51] zero loan and then many listening one
[1:22:54] could reach the exit of six and you come
[1:22:58] up and you write a big over six on that
[1:23:00] income tax paper you don't get a lot of
[1:23:03] money back are you gonna take out a loan
[1:23:05] that we just talked are you gonna play
[1:23:10] tight on that and then we went through
[1:23:13] the one field you know and I know a man
[1:23:19] in this message this statement was made
[1:23:21] by somebody it has to be true about it
[1:23:23] but this man is back to it and went in
[1:23:26] the church been gone for good many years
[1:23:27] he come back told pastor that he wanted
[1:23:30] to start coming back to church he said
[1:23:32] you got to catch up on mobile that guy
[1:23:33] before you can be counted a member of
[1:23:37] our group
[1:23:47] Brown says these fellers taking the paw
[1:23:49] prints and things fleecing the people he
[1:23:54] said that same old Catholic pain the
[1:23:57] charge nobody misses a nice ice the play
[1:24:03] pace the play he said same spirit they
[1:24:07] Catholic Church said that's why I don't
[1:24:11] preach you um cotton only done it one
[1:24:15] time that was a day boy was telling this
