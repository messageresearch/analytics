[3:03] just children and they
[3:04] will pick up on that start sticking
[3:07] tongue out at their
[3:09] children all right fifth seal Grace
[3:13] Revelations chapter 6 now we've already
[3:15] been through the first four seals if you
[3:17] if you have any questions about those
[3:19] four since we have some new ones in here
[3:22] go back and look online because they're
[3:24] all online and you can pick up where we
[3:26] went from the first seal up to the
[3:28] fourth seal now we're in the fifth seal
[3:31] all right and I'll explain this a little
[3:33] more here and I'll I'll draw it up there
[3:35] again but uh I was looking the other day
[3:38] for some other colors we need to there
[3:40] there got to be some really bright like
[3:42] high defin colors now that we can use
[3:44] the ceiling so low I apologize but the
[3:46] glare off of that thing on here and hard
[3:49] to see so we just have to do what we can
[3:52] do one
[3:57] those neon colors neon
[4:01] colors
[4:03] yeah we'll we'll see what we can do all
[4:05] right let's
[4:06] go and when he had opened the fifth seal
[4:09] I saw under the altar The Souls of them
[4:12] that were slain for the word of God for
[4:14] the testimony which they held and they
[4:17] cried with a loud voice saying how long
[4:19] oh Lord holy and true Dost thou not
[4:22] judge and
[4:25] avenge I have that word
[4:27] underlined the bride does not
[4:31] anything so that could not be the bride
[4:33] anything to do with the bride that has
[4:35] nothing to
[4:36] do with the bride of Jesus Christ cuz
[4:41] it's that's not what we say we say
[4:43] forgive them Lord for they don't know
[4:45] what they do so this is a different
[4:48] group all right they CED with a loud
[4:50] voice saying how long oh Lord holy and
[4:52] true dust thou not judge and avenge our
[4:55] blood see on them that dwell on the
[4:58] Earth and white Roes were given unto
[5:01] every one of
[5:02] them in their theophonic condition
[5:05] because they're under the altar see you
[5:07] and I get eternal life the white robe
[5:09] supposedly we supposedly we get it here
[5:13] I said supposedly if you're not born
[5:14] again you don't have it all right but we
[5:16] get white robes down here when you're
[5:17] born again you get a white robe all
[5:19] right which is the righteousness of the
[5:22] saints that will tell you in Revelations
[5:25] over 19 I believe it is the white Rob
[5:27] and white robes were given unto every
[5:29] one of of them and it was said unto them
[5:31] that they should rest yet for a little
[5:33] season until their fellow servants also
[5:35] and their Brethren that should be killed
[5:37] as they
[5:39] were there's another clue as they were
[5:43] should be fulfilled all right so now
[5:46] let's go back just for a second and look
[5:49] at this and I'll I'll do it over here I
[5:52] guess you can can you see it better over
[5:53] there or over here over there over here
[5:56] yeah okay all right well we looked at
[5:59] the church ages here's the church ages
[6:02] just to go back through one more time
[6:04] but I'm going to take take my time
[6:06] because you're going to have to see I
[6:08] want everybody to understand
[6:10] something and I don't want to be real
[6:12] critical about anything but but it's
[6:16] just my
[6:17] job it's a
[6:19] gift like dve said it's a gift I
[6:23] have you see this thing right here m
[6:30] now
[6:32] technically technically get it when you
[6:34] can
[6:37] technically you can't bend over and
[6:40] hide your normal Hy when you
[6:46] do does everybody uh two three four if
[6:51] that's
[6:53] okay then we have what is this love
[6:56] right now we know we see we receive the
[6:59] Holy Ghost here is that correct we don't
[7:01] wait till brother brand put Holy Spirit
[7:03] here on the pyramid cuz all this goes
[7:07] together the seals the Daniel 7 weeks
[7:11] the the the plagues the bows the statue
[7:15] of a perfect man MH it it's all
[7:17] intertwined you can't just take one
[7:19] subject and say well this is one subject
[7:21] depart from another no they all
[7:22] intertwined together right all right so
[7:24] we receive the holy ghost at Faith is
[7:26] that correct amen all right
[7:30] virtue knowledge Temperance patience
[7:32] godliness brotherly kindness I'm missing
[7:33] one in there but right there it is
[7:36] behind you if you want to look at it
[7:37] right we have Holy Spirit and then the
[7:39] Capstone is
[7:40] love just to be real honest with
[7:44] you you got to be here before you can
[7:49] understand these right okay
[7:53] now the faith of the fathers is what
[7:56] everybody had in the first church age
[7:58] remember I said talk to about that this
[8:00] down here was Faith but this down here
[8:02] the foundation was the faith of the
[8:05] fathers all right everybody understand
[8:07] that say amen amen okay right faith of
[8:11] the fathers then we went through the
[8:13] church ages and about the fourth age
[8:15] like we were talking about here the the
[8:17] fourth Church
[8:18] AE went down right went down in the
[8:21] ground they took on father son Holy
[8:24] Ghost baptism they took on eternal hell
[8:26] they took on Trinity they took on all
[8:28] these false doctrines
[8:31] everybody got say Amen participation
[8:34] today we're going to participate cuz if
[8:36] you don't say oh me or I don't I don't
[8:38] understand that but the faith of the
[8:40] fathers was here now what happened was
[8:43] it got
[8:45] eroded it wasn't that the word was not
[8:47] as powerful but Satan had put a a
[8:50] wrapper around it or a buffer around it
[8:52] or a Doctrine around it right Doctrine
[8:56] is what kills you cancer doesn't kill
[8:58] you and heart attacks don't kill you
[9:00] doctrin kill you cancer kills this guy
[9:05] doctrin kills the ones inside that you
[9:07] know Jesus said don't be don't worry
[9:08] about the guy that killed this thing he
[9:10] said wor about the guy that can kill the
[9:12] soul God's the only one who can kill the
[9:13] soul Satan can't kill anything he can
[9:15] kill this thing because of putting
[9:17] things on you but he cannot kill the
[9:19] soul God's the only one who can do that
[9:21] he made it he can kill it right so
[9:24] that's his priority but now Faith of the
[9:27] fathers was right here correct right had
[9:29] the word the power of the word working
[9:31] well right here in this fourth Church
[9:32] age this is Fifth Sixth and seven here
[9:35] in this fourth Church age it went in the
[9:37] ground died all right we showed it in a
[9:39] parallel over here but what I'm trying
[9:40] to show you
[9:41] is we had to come up to this age here
[9:44] which was what the eagle correct right
[9:47] all right and then we had to come to
[9:49] Malachi
[9:51] 4 which is he will restore the faith of
[9:55] the
[9:55] fathers to the Pentecostal children
[10:00] right remember Malachi 4 the first part
[10:03] Malachi 3
[10:04] actually was to
[10:06] restore the
[10:08] faith of the
[10:11] Old Testament to the new right then this
[10:16] got eat down and then let's just read M
[10:19] you say well we read 100 times word got
[10:22] eat down not 101 101 times we're going
[10:24] to read this all
[10:26] right behold I will send
[10:34] you Elijah the prophet before the coming
[10:36] of the great and Greatful day of the
[10:38] Lord and he shall turn the heart of the
[10:41] fathers to the children all right the
[10:44] old Pentecostal fathers to the New
[10:46] Testament children all right then as we
[10:49] go on up through the church ages that
[10:51] was
[10:52] lost then we come up into the eagle age
[10:55] where brother rown said he that that
[10:57] messenger of M would tie those Lo loose
[11:00] ends together well we got loose ends
[11:01] down through the church ages correct
[11:04] yeah and the Heart of the children to
[11:07] their fathers so the heart of these
[11:09] Pentecostal babbling children is going
[11:11] to be restored back to the faith of the
[11:13] fathers everybody got that to say Amen
[11:17] so we're supposed to act like what the
[11:19] foundation was all right so if we don't
[11:22] act like the foundation was we can't
[11:25] understand the rest of what's going
[11:27] on because
[11:31] in time in time
[11:35] TimeWise the Rapture takes place right
[11:43] here you what I say in time in time the
[11:48] Rapture takes place at the end of the
[11:50] seventh Church
[11:51] age now we know as a fact that the that
[11:54] the Capstone is to come down on to the
[11:57] people yes all right but the Rapture
[12:01] takes place here and raptures all these
[12:05] Church ages together correct everybody
[12:09] guys say
[12:11] Amen
[12:12] do all right the Rapture takes place at
[12:16] the end of the seventh Church age now
[12:19] remember you got to remember though that
[12:21] that seventh Church age I said time
[12:23] because time goes on the seventh Church
[12:26] age actually goes on into the Millennium
[12:28] what the problem said we're still in
[12:30] time we're still in time we're still in
[12:33] we're still in Grace until the white
[12:35] Throne judgment so we got to go through
[12:37] marriage supper Battle of armagedon we
[12:39] don't go through but you understand the
[12:41] Earth does Thousand Years Millennium
[12:43] they have to be raised back up white
[12:45] Throne judgment that's when time
[12:49] stops the the Millennium is a is still
[12:51] you're still in the old you're still in
[12:53] the old seventh day Sabbath Church age
[12:56] right we are resurrected sitting in
[12:58] Heavenly place out of the church ages in
[13:01] the eth
[13:03] day the Millennium is not Eternal it's a
[13:07] thous years One Day 2 Day 3 Day 4 day 5
[13:10] day the the Earth is going to continue
[13:13] to grow we're going to build
[13:17] houses oh
[13:21] okay usually when you raise hand you KNE
[13:23] something just raise both of them praise
[13:26] God but that's right I mean time is
[13:29] continued but not for the bride that's
[13:31] why I said in time the Rapture takes
[13:34] place after the seven Church AE ends
[13:36] down here you everybody understand is
[13:39] that not confusing that's confusing say
[13:40] it's confusing everything okay all right
[13:43] so the Rapture takes place here now I
[13:47] said in
[13:48] time cuz the headstone has to come down
[13:51] onto a group of people to take us in a
[13:53] Rapture right but
[13:56] TimeWise the Rapture takes place right
[13:58] here
[14:00] which is Seal number one 2
[14:03] 3 Rapture takes place on the what four
[14:09] seal right for us takes place on the
[14:12] four seal because remember we read the
[14:15] fifth seal there's no combat Beast
[14:18] there's no coming SE right everything's
[14:22] gone see then the fifth Seal The Sixth
[14:24] Seal and the seventh seal
[14:29] listen before I before we
[14:32] begin this is now set aside
[14:35] for you and I cuz the headstone could
[14:39] only come at the end time right there's
[14:43] a lot of people here's my point there's
[14:45] a lot of people going to go into Rapture
[14:47] let me put it this way 99% of the people
[14:50] that go into Rapture never is not going
[14:52] to have the headstone right
[14:56] 99% there's only going to be 1% of a BRI
[15:00] that go can you see me from
[15:02] there I want to I want to see me I want
[15:04] to see this this right here okay I don't
[15:07] care if they see me they see my finger
[15:09] but I don't care they see me I want to
[15:10] see this does everybody understand that
[15:13] though as a people only a small small
[15:18] group is going to have
[15:20] this Capstone come down on them to seal
[15:26] a group in cuz that's why people have a
[15:29] real bad problem and I know people even
[15:31] around here have preached that you don't
[15:33] get the Holy Ghost until right here
[15:35] because brother R he does make a St and
[15:37] he said you come all this way and you
[15:38] don't have the Holy Ghost yet
[15:40] well that's true that's not
[15:46] true you said oh you talking about a
[15:48] prophet no I know what he's talking
[15:51] about he's right in both places amen our
[15:56] mentality is wrong you got to get the
[15:58] holy ghost to have
[16:00] faith virtue knowledge Temperance
[16:03] patience you got to have the Holy Ghost
[16:04] you don't understand the Bible says
[16:06] without the Holy Ghost you can't
[16:07] understand who Jesus is right and put
[16:10] his bodily figure in here that's right
[16:13] that's who he is we're his body you got
[16:14] to understand the body of God Amen all
[16:16] right cuz we are the body of God all
[16:18] right so you got to have the Holy Ghost
[16:20] first but this is a refilling right but
[16:23] if you'll watch where brother bandam
[16:25] gets up to the statute of a perfect man
[16:26] he says he said here Here Comes these
[16:30] waves and he draws waves down through
[16:32] here and what it's doing in it's
[16:35] sealing a group of people in right not
[16:38] giving them the Holy Ghost to take a
[16:40] Rapture but giving them the faith of the
[16:43] fathers and then adopting them into the
[16:45] family so that God seals it all together
[16:48] and that means you got all seven virtues
[16:50] working in your
[16:52] life everybody understand say Amen am
[16:55] okay so there's where we're at as far as
[16:58] we're looking at three things we're
[17:00] looking at the natural world all right
[17:03] CU when you get finished with the fourth
[17:05] seal Rapture takes place so you got to
[17:08] get in you got to put it into a bodily
[17:10] form and a spiritual form cuz we're not
[17:13] here when the fif F over but the fifth
[17:15] seal has to open to us down here right
[17:18] before we go there that's right right so
[17:21] there's only going to be a small group
[17:22] of people going to understand this
[17:23] because these people that are dead and
[17:25] gone on they can have a revelation of it
[17:28] but I'm talking about when it locks her
[17:30] together that's right okay when that
[17:33] thing comes down when The Headstone
[17:34] comes down onto a group of people
[17:36] they're going to be that's going to be
[17:39] the head which is who Christ that's
[17:41] going to be him coming to the body and
[17:42] it's only going to be a short period of
[17:44] time and we're going in a Rapture short
[17:46] period of time the only way we're going
[17:49] to take a Rapture is for that headstone
[17:51] to come down cuz the headstone has to
[17:52] come back only comes back in the end
[17:55] time when you said there's 90% 99 99 but
[17:59] was that all the seven the six Church
[18:01] ages 7 to seven Church AG is not going
[18:05] to understand seven Church ages not know
[18:07] where they were coming right no the only
[18:09] people that's well actually basically
[18:10] the only people that's going to make the
[18:12] change is the ones that are I mean make
[18:15] the physical change there's going to be
[18:17] aive everybody from today
[18:21] back they're dead right the race has run
[18:24] they finished their course they've done
[18:27] what God wanted them to do no shame
[18:29] involved at all that's what somebody
[18:30] asked me the other day about Sister
[18:32] Margaret uh atting about Gary you know
[18:34] Sister Margaret said well how do you
[18:35] explain that I the only way I can
[18:37] explain it's the way Dad explained it
[18:39] God was finished with it that's right
[18:41] right God's finished with you he's going
[18:43] to take you home you know what he gave a
[18:45] man 15 more years one time and that was
[18:48] the worst 15 years that man ever had
[18:51] right he should have went on when God
[18:53] wanted him to go on cuz what he done was
[18:55] he got into the permissive will of God
[18:58] and really messed his life up when
[19:00] you're ready to go when I'm ready to go
[19:01] if God wants to see me to the chains for
[19:03] the body chains I am heading toward that
[19:06] but if he wants to take me tomorrow then
[19:08] you know what my if I believe I'm a
[19:10] Child of God then then that's the
[19:12] perfect will of God my race is
[19:14] done I can't say no more when brother
[19:16] random was killed in 1965 his race was
[19:19] done he had already brought the message
[19:22] and it took a group of people then to be
[19:23] the voice the final voice to the final
[19:26] age in The Bride of Jesus Christ
[19:29] everybody got that so if if he's done
[19:32] with you then there's no shame you're
[19:33] going to come up in the resurrection
[19:34] actually you're going to come up before
[19:35] we get
[19:36] Ted so you're going to you're going to
[19:39] be you're going to be in a glorified
[19:41] condition before the ones that take the
[19:44] the body
[19:45] change that clock's not stopping today
[19:47] is
[19:50] it you know what even spiders come to
[19:53] church
[19:59] you're the Holy
[20:01] Ghost is
[20:04] that deep that a part of that Holy GH
[20:08] this is this is growing you up into this
[20:10] and that's the whole call that's the see
[20:14] the Deep call to the deep down here call
[20:16] you into the body then once you're in
[20:19] the body God doesn't quit talking to you
[20:20] that's
[20:21] right no he talks to you more yes and
[20:25] when you come to this right here see
[20:27] you've come you've come to what 99% of
[20:30] the people's not going to come to is a
[20:32] seiling in where God says
[20:34] hey if you're going to hear from this
[20:37] guy it's like Jesus as a type remember
[20:39] Jesus didn't need the Holy Ghost he was
[20:41] the Holy Ghost but on the River Jordan
[20:43] he received the Holy Ghost come down as
[20:46] a dove and the father says this is my
[20:49] beloved Son in whom I please to dwell
[20:52] right here when he does that to you he
[20:54] says the same identical thing the night
[20:56] or day or moment you receive the baptism
[20:58] of Holy Ghost God said I'm pleased to
[21:00] dwell in that vessel
[21:02] but let's go on to faith I mean let's go
[21:05] on to virt let's go on to knowledge
[21:06] that's go and if you do walk up through
[21:08] this and you see that God because
[21:10] remember the sister Shepherd's dream it
[21:13] was a pyramid right brother brandham
[21:15] pulled the top off of that pyramid well
[21:17] when he pulled the top off it had to
[21:19] kind of look like
[21:25] this John going
[21:29] we going to pray we're going to pray for
[21:30] the sick one let's just put it right
[21:33] here can everybody see
[21:37] that this is a pyramid in
[21:39] itself this is not a complete pyramid
[21:43] remember brother Bram said the pyramid
[21:44] is not complete right you even say Jesus
[21:48] said I he the Bible says he's the head
[21:50] of the corner he's Chief Cornerstone
[21:53] what does the corner look
[21:55] like midd pyramid right so there she
[21:58] found found you got your little pyramids
[22:00] all the way up through here you got
[22:01] little pyramids and there's your
[22:02] Cornerstone then you start working on
[22:04] these things and it's not that you get
[22:05] virtue peel that off and hand it away
[22:08] and say I'm done with that no this is
[22:10] just I've always said this is just in
[22:12] here for reference purposes there are no
[22:15] lines in the pyramid that's right right
[22:17] there are steps right there's no lines
[22:20] cuz you're going to receive virtue the
[22:22] time that this happen you're going to
[22:24] receive knowledge at the time this
[22:25] happen so it's not that you're going to
[22:28] get all at once and then you're not
[22:29] going to need it anymore right no that's
[22:32] not the way it works but what was I
[22:35] talking about a minute ago when I left
[22:36] my point oh the Holy Spirit when uh
[22:39] sister shepher had a her dream he said
[22:41] he whipped the top off right and then
[22:43] what happened now I'm not talking about
[22:45] the one where he looked down in it and
[22:46] saw White Stone he's talking about
[22:49] sister Shepherd's
[22:50] dream right remember and the water
[22:52] started flowing out of the top of the
[22:54] pyramid what did he say was coming out
[22:56] trash trash that's not down here that's
[23:00] right here so we still got
[23:03] trash that's what he said he said trash
[23:05] was coming
[23:07] out and that's what's that's what
[23:09] happened to that water washing into the
[23:10] water of the word puts the trash but
[23:13] there's one day that this thing right
[23:14] here is going to have
[23:16] to just like when you seal a
[23:18] jar once that thing sealed like Daddy's
[23:21] preaching now about the sealing of the
[23:24] people once that thing sealed you get
[23:25] sealed into the body down here Jesus on
[23:27] the River Jordan
[23:29] then in a TI God took him upon a
[23:30] mountain and said this is my beloved Son
[23:33] in whom I'm pleased to dwell hear ye him
[23:35] in other words he come to a position not
[23:38] that he needed to he was doing it for me
[23:39] and you Jesus's life was an example for
[23:43] us he was the he was the New Birth he
[23:46] was the Holy Ghost he was God he was
[23:48] Emanuel he was Jehovah he was all these
[23:50] things he didn't need to gain he didn't
[23:52] gain any new attributes remember God
[23:54] don't gain new attributes you always
[23:55] watch you and I have to gain new
[23:58] attribute yes CU this is the attributes
[24:01] of God
[24:03] yes all right everybody got that so the
[24:05] Holy Spirit once that pushes it out that
[24:07] Holy Spirit sits down there and seals
[24:09] that right all right seals you this is
[24:12] who in whom I'm pleased to dwell hear ye
[24:15] him everybody understand yes all right
[24:18] then this comes down a little bit closer
[24:21] there's a there's a spot I want to I
[24:23] want to get on Statue of a perfect man
[24:26] that if you'll notice and it's actually
[24:28] of a perfect man and this this this kind
[24:30] of correlates with and I know it's a
[24:34] little little B here's an adult we're
[24:37] the female and God's the male right all
[24:40] right brother Brown said it's a diamond
[24:42] shaped pyramid or a diamond shape
[24:44] headstone you watch it you want read it
[24:48] it like a diamond so was a
[24:51] diamond a diamond this is what he's
[24:54] doing he's not just sitting down on us
[24:56] flat like this what's a diamond like
[24:58] that's a diamond
[25:01] right
[25:03] right he's not going to just sit down on
[25:06] top of
[25:07] us he's going all the way through
[25:10] everybody understand that I mean you
[25:12] watching brother BR he said A diamond
[25:14] that's a diamond this ain't a diamond
[25:16] this is a diamond diamond shape he said
[25:19] there's a flange to keep the water out
[25:22] well how you do that you got that thing
[25:24] so perfectly fit water just going to
[25:26] what low right down to him but it he's
[25:29] moving down through us he's not just
[25:30] going to sit down on top of us he's
[25:32] moving through us right you can bring
[25:34] that point all the way down to here if
[25:35] you want to cuz he started right down
[25:37] here where he started bringing you The
[25:39] Headstone yes I mean that's kind of
[25:41] we're kind of off our point but still
[25:43] it's a good
[25:45] thought maybe we'll teach on that when
[25:47] we get finished with this but my point
[25:50] today is is
[25:53] remember
[25:55] TimeWise the Raptor takes place on the
[25:57] four sale right
[25:59] all the brides gone yes this is bride
[26:02] Church ages right here there's no church
[26:04] age up here right that's not a church
[26:06] age all right everybody got that this is
[26:10] not an extra Church age now this is the
[26:13] Eighth Day that's eternal life now that
[26:15] truly that's what comes to you at the
[26:16] new birth in a baby form little be be
[26:19] baby
[26:21] form brother said it's a spot a
[26:25] spot but when you come to the when you
[26:27] come to all virtues working in your life
[26:29] so what am I trying to
[26:31] say you can take a
[26:34] Rapture after you kill that
[26:37] spider no you don't have to kill him
[26:40] yeah
[26:44] yeah see a
[26:46] Rapture the Rapture takes place on the
[26:48] fourth
[26:50] seal there's got a group of people come
[26:53] to this diamond shaped pyramid because
[26:56] it's got to when God sets down down on
[26:58] top of us as bride he's going to feel
[27:01] brother Bown said he'll F every fiber of
[27:03] your being and we go into Rapture see he
[27:05] hasn't F this right here yet that's
[27:07] right I said yeah he purchased it
[27:10] purchased it at Calvary but this thing
[27:12] right here has not been redeemed yet as
[27:15] far as a physical moment of Redemption
[27:18] all
[27:19] right wish still leave a thing alone
[27:21] listen to what I'm saying I would try to
[27:24] well the thing ain't going to hurt
[27:25] nobody but not listening to this is
[27:27] going to hurt somebody all
[27:29] right fifth six and seven seal is for
[27:33] the Redemption of this guy nobody in
[27:35] this point of time I said of time
[27:38] there's nobody in this point of time is
[27:41] going to need that that's right cuz
[27:43] they're usually they're all dead right
[27:46] only the alive and remain okay right so
[27:50] we got to understand that fifth seal
[27:53] we're going to show the natural part
[27:55] we'll start next Sunday show the natural
[27:57] part of the seal
[27:58] which is the 144,000 you say all the
[28:01] hang on a minute that you read there
[28:04] where it says it says right
[28:13] here testimony which they held in cown
[28:15] with the loud voice said how long and
[28:17] white robes are given unto them that
[28:18] they should rest for a little season
[28:20] until their fellow servants also and
[28:23] their Brethren that should be killed as
[28:24] they were 144,000 got to be killed
[28:28] right that's right as they were they're
[28:31] Jews right so the 144,000 is what Jews
[28:34] there's not going to be another killing
[28:35] of the Jews Like Ian and Hitler cuz
[28:37] that's where these people are coming
[28:38] from right these people under this altar
[28:41] in the fifth seal natural seal is going
[28:45] has been killed because they were Jews
[28:49] period they don't know nothing about
[28:51] Jesus Christ they don't know nothing
[28:53] about the Bible except that it
[28:55] exists see that's why it's going to be
[28:57] the you're going to see the greatest
[28:59] move of
[29:01] Grace because God give eternal life to a
[29:03] group of people that didn't even want
[29:06] right that's right they still don't want
[29:09] that's right but God said okay I blinded
[29:13] your eyes so I can take a bride that's
[29:16] right so to be just to be a just God I'm
[29:19] going to give you eternal life for the
[29:22] testimony you held not the testimony of
[29:24] Jesus Christ you're going to seize the
[29:25] 144,000 is going to be killed for the
[29:27] testimony of Jesus Christ we'll see that
[29:29] in the natural part of the seal so we're
[29:31] going to go through next Sunday and
[29:33] probably a couple Sundays on the natural
[29:35] opening of that seal what happens during
[29:36] the natural time of that seal then we're
[29:39] going to go into the spiritual part of
[29:40] that seal and give you the timeline of
[29:42] it but I just want you to see this but I
[29:44] want you to realize one
[29:45] thing if you don't have all these
[29:47] virtues working in your
[29:49] life then then you're not just going to
[29:52] automatically get
[29:54] elevated to the cap Stone that's right
[29:57] yes sir you got to have all this working
[29:59] in your life it's got to be prevalent in
[30:01] your life not just show up every once in
[30:03] a while that's right the devil shows up
[30:05] every once in a while I mean the devil's
[30:06] usually there all the time God shows up
[30:08] just every once in a while sorry I had
[30:09] it backwards sorry yeah brother Keith
[30:12] and I were talking about this morning
[30:13] talking about living as humans we live
[30:15] as humans 99% of the time that's right
[30:18] we do 99% of time we live as humans and
[30:20] then every little once in a while we get
[30:22] a glimpse of God but you know what God
[30:24] has took that little Glimpse and he's
[30:26] going to break back
[30:28] he's going to open up and it's not going
[30:30] to we still going to live human lives
[30:31] but we're not going to be and it's not
[30:33] sinless Perfection by no means but we're
[30:35] not going to be bothered if we're still
[30:37] bothered by things we were bothered
[30:38] before people come on we got to be we
[30:40] got to get this thing right
[30:41] here this thing will take care we talked
[30:44] about it last
[30:45] Sunday a lot of you are just divorced
[30:47] some of your problems not killed them
[30:50] that's
[30:51] right I told y'all 90% of the people in
[30:54] this message I don't believe born again
[30:55] or they wouldn't act the way they do
[30:57] they're just Sanctified which is a good
[30:59] condition to be in but it's not a good
[31:01] condition to stay there that's
[31:04] right but I'm going to be say one hard
[31:06] statement if you're still doing the same
[31:07] thing you were doing two years
[31:09] ago I'm going to give you Grace two
[31:11] years ago if you're doing the same
[31:13] identical thing you doing 10 years ago
[31:14] where you been that's right where you
[31:17] been you come to this church you say the
[31:20] word of God's being preached in this
[31:21] church you say that everything's doing
[31:23] wonderful in this church as far as the
[31:25] word goes and then you still act the
[31:27] same way you did two years
[31:30] you get the Holy Ghost that won't
[31:32] happen that won't
[31:34] happen so let's start back
[31:37] here remember brother Dale said he
[31:39] wished I could tell all of you you
[31:41] weren't born
[31:42] again some of you even prove it but but
[31:47] you know what growing grace and
[31:48] knowledge just keep growing that's right
[31:50] get the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost will
[31:51] change you amen it will not just divorce
[31:54] your feelings that's right it will
[31:57] change your way thinking just like we're
[31:58] talking about this course that we're
[31:59] taking this Dave Ramsey course I mean
[32:01] that that's a carnal expression but it's
[32:03] changing it'll change your life thank
[32:07] you some of you for the email that you
[32:08] sent about that course how it's really
[32:10] helping you but but but to a person I
[32:13] told you I'll tell you the ones that not
[32:15] going to it to a person if you'll
[32:17] understand if you'll ask some of the
[32:18] people who took this course it brings a
[32:20] husband and wife closer together least
[32:22] not bring bring it makes you discuss
[32:24] things and and if some of you worked on
[32:26] your budget this week you did get close
[32:28] together I don't see any black eyes we
[32:31] hav have to pray for any broke arms or
[32:33] legs so maybe somebody sat down and done
[32:35] something doesn't it doesn't it do
[32:37] didn't it do that it really did it bring
[32:39] it brings you together and that's what
[32:40] you know if you can't if you can't live
[32:42] with your
[32:44] wife how you going to live with others
[32:47] cuz she's part of you okay but we got to
[32:50] start somewhere we got let's started the
[32:52] foundation I'm going to go through the
[32:54] fifth sixth and seventh seal but let's
[32:55] just let's just keep it back down here
[32:58] though and say
[33:00] God I need to be born again I need this
[33:03] thing that I've been dealing with for 2
[33:05] years I need it out of my life and I put
[33:06] it on a calendar just like I told them
[33:09] guys down there at the at the baptism
[33:11] man when I went down in the water down
[33:13] there in Gil Georgia in 1998 when I went
[33:16] in the water when I come up out of that
[33:17] water I was the most empty individual
[33:19] you ever seen in your life I felt
[33:23] empty we hugged each other and cried for
[33:27] when minutes but that was the most that
[33:29] when I come up out of that water I said
[33:31] God I want this stuff dead and I'm
[33:33] burying it right here I'm not coming
[33:36] back up with it it's staying right here
[33:39] that's what I told them guys I said you
[33:40] put a steak in it right
[33:42] here say Satan right here is where you
[33:44] died oh yeah you got you got an
[33:47] opportunity to come and talk to me but
[33:49] you died right here and of course I've
[33:52] grown from there in Grace and knowledge
[33:53] I hope everybody's seen it with the June
[33:56] and I together have grown in Grace and
[33:57] knowledge
[33:59] through those years but let's not go
[34:01] backwards this is not a going backward
[34:03] gospel that's right everything's going
[34:05] up right he's taking us up into the
[34:07] headstone so that's where the fifth six
[34:09] fifth sixth and seventh seal really
[34:11] works in a group of people and you
[34:13] really not going to see it with just a
[34:14] very short
[34:16] time everybody understand that you're
[34:17] going to see it a very short time you're
[34:19] not going to see a great 2-year
[34:21] manifestation or or or a long
[34:23] manifestation of of God changing your
[34:25] your your being right it's going to be
[34:28] very short brother Brown said a short
[34:30] quick powerful message will sweep out
[34:32] what is that that's somebody that God
[34:34] seals in and says hey I'm adopting that
[34:36] guy or that
[34:38] girl brother or sister both they don't
[34:41] just adopt men we're all feminist in the
[34:43] body but somebody's going to be adopted
[34:45] and this is going to work in their life
[34:47] you're going to see so much grace where
[34:48] you're not going to see anything
[34:51] else that's suppos to help me more than
[34:53] anything and and sure I'm hard on things
[34:56] but but
[34:58] your life always speaks louder than your
[35:00] word that's right always you can confess
[35:03] all you want to but your life is always
[35:05] going to speak louder than words so

[35:08] work on this and and work our way up I'm
[35:11] going to teach on the fifth seal Sixth
[35:12] Seal and seventh seal but you know what
