[17:41] we thank you
[17:42] in jesus name amen
[17:46] okay luke
[17:50] 11 starting with 29.
[17:57] now watch i want to use these two
[17:59] scriptures
[18:00] they're saying the same thing but i want
[18:02] you to pick up how it's handled
[18:04] and what is is going with it and you'll
[18:06] see it all tied together
[18:08] and when the people were gathered to get
[18:11] thick together
[18:13] he began to say now this is jesus
[18:16] speaking to the people the multitude all
[18:18] right
[18:20] this is an evil generation
[18:24] they seek a sign and there shall no sign
[18:27] be given it
[18:28] but the sign of jonas the prophet
[18:32] whereas jonas was assigned unto the
[18:34] ninevites
[18:35] so shall also the son of man be
[18:38] to this generation all right
[18:42] now watch the queen of the south shall
[18:46] rise up in the judgment with the men of
[18:49] this generation
[18:50] and condemn them for she came from the
[18:53] uttermost parts of the earth to
[18:56] hear the wisdom of solomon and the
[18:58] greater than solomon
[18:59] is here and the men of nineveh shall
[19:02] rise
[19:02] up in the judgment with this generation
[19:05] and shall condemn it for they
[19:07] repented at the preaching of jonas and
[19:10] behold a greater
[19:12] than jonas is here okay now just watch
[19:15] the point now and listen to what said go
[19:17] to
[19:18] matthew now 12 38.
[19:25] the insertion of the pharisees or excuse
[19:27] me certain of the
[19:28] scribes and the pharisees answered
[19:30] saying
[19:31] master we would see a sign from thee
[19:36] and he answered and said unto them an
[19:39] evil and adulterous generation
[19:41] seeketh after a son there shall no sign
[19:44] be given
[19:45] to it but the sign of the prophet jonas
[19:50] for as jonas was three days and three
[19:52] nights in the whale's belly
[19:54] so shall the son of man be three days
[19:57] and three nights
[19:58] in the heart of the earth you may be
[20:00] seated the lord at his blessing
[20:02] to the reading of the word now i want to
[20:07] just take a thought
[20:11] you know
[20:14] and talk about a little bit about tying
[20:16] this
[20:17] the son of man the jonas and the thing
[20:19] because
[20:20] you know you uh these in arguments
[20:24] always has been arguments about the uh
[20:27] when it would be three days and three
[20:29] nights and and all of the heart of the
[20:31] earth and
[20:32] and the things like that that would be
[20:34] and uh you know
[20:36] they've argued over that point all the
[20:37] way down through time
[20:40] but the scripture is plain in stating it
[20:44] that the prophet jonas
[20:48] all right and it describes that jonas
[20:51] was three days and three nights in the
[20:54] whale's belly
[20:56] all right now then it said and so
[20:59] how shall the son of man be three days
[21:02] and three nights in the heart of the
[21:04] earth
[21:05] all right so then there's no problem of
[21:08] understanding if we just look at it with
[21:11] simple sense and
[21:12] ideas or thoughts and see that jonas
[21:15] would be
[21:16] three days and three nights and and the
[21:18] son of man would be
[21:19] three days and three nights all right
[21:22] and see
[21:22] like i said the argument has been that
[21:24] he was crucified here and
[21:26] resurrected here and he'd done this and
[21:28] then the other and they try to put
[21:30] together
[21:31] all of the things but just think about
[21:33] it
[21:35] it's not dealing necessarily with
[21:38] three days you know they're there
[21:44] jonas was in the whale's belly for three
[21:46] days
[21:47] all right jesus was in the heart of the
[21:49] earth or
[21:50] that part in the the doing of the of of
[21:53] his part
[21:54] of the son of man and for three days and
[21:57] three nights
[21:59] like i said then you argue this and you
[22:01] argue that well why argue
[22:04] think about what it's talking about
[22:08] all right now jonas was
[22:13] in the whale's belly for three days or
[22:14] three nights all right
[22:18] and then he raised come out all right
[22:21] the lord jesus christ was three days and
[22:23] three nights and then
[22:24] he came out of the grave all right
[22:27] so then it's not to argue how many days
[22:30] of what this
[22:30] is well that's three days they want to
[22:32] say he was crucified thursday
[22:35] friday saturday sunday hung around come
[22:37] up sunday morning
[22:39] and this that the other the arguments
[22:40] backwards and forth
[22:42] but why talk about that why not think
[22:44] about what is being said
[22:47] what was jonas
[22:52] all right the three days and the three
[22:54] nights of jonas
[22:56] was the sign of the resurrection
[23:00] and that's what they asked they asked
[23:04] about the resurrection
[23:06] you know the sign give us a sign they
[23:09] said all right i'll give you the sign
[23:12] jonas was the sign of the resurrection
[23:15] not necessarily had to be three days
[23:17] three nights
[23:18] that's fine that's you you don't get the
[23:20] point don't don't uh
[23:22] put it all out but think about it you're
[23:25] talking about the resurrection
[23:30] instead of three days and three nights
[23:34] because that's what he's dealing with
[23:35] jonas jonas raised he come out
[23:39] all right resurrection all right see the
[23:42] lord jesus was crucified put in
[23:44] and came out
[23:48] resurrection all right
[23:51] now jonas being the sign of the
[23:53] resurrection
[23:56] they now keep that thought in your mind
[24:00] jonas would be the sign of the
[24:02] resurrection
[24:05] all right then the lord jesus christ the
[24:08] son of man
[24:11] would be the sign of the resurrection
[24:15] in his part now listen to what i'm
[24:17] saying so then
[24:18] who is this son of man amen
[24:22] he said well the art the christ the son
[24:24] of the living god you know
[24:26] all right we got many you could go
[24:28] through many many
[24:29] lengthy ways of approaching and talking
[24:32] about
[24:34] but remember the son of man
[24:41] jonas was a tight right
[24:44] for the resurrection the son of man
[24:48] was the type of the resurrection all
[24:51] right
[24:51] now who is this son of man he's a
[24:54] resurrection
[24:56] amen okay keep it to the simple
[25:00] point of thinking about it see jesus was
[25:03] the same as jonas
[25:07] don't argue about trying to figure out
[25:09] what this day is what that day
[25:10] is think about what it means
[25:15] jonas was assigned to the
[25:18] the people at nineveh all right
[25:21] a sign of the resurrection
[25:26] okay sign of the resurrection
[25:31] jesus was the son of man
[25:36] he was three days and three nights in
[25:38] the heart of the earth and then he
[25:39] raised up
[25:41] the sign of the resurrection
[25:45] all right now remember the son of the
[25:48] remember jonas now
[25:50] get what i'm saying jonas is a sign of
[25:53] the resurrection
[25:54] jesus is a sign of the resurrection
[25:58] all right that's it there's no need new
[26:01] arguing over this we firm believer we
[26:03] know what it is
[26:04] because if you take it and put it in
[26:05] there correctly you'll come out to the
[26:06] right dates anyway
[26:08] that jesus was crucified on friday
[26:10] afternoon resurrected early sunday
[26:12] morning
[26:14] making three days and three nights
[26:18] all right you can fuss about that but
[26:21] the main thing
[26:22] is i want you to talk about or to us to
[26:24] think about
[26:26] resurrection
[26:29] resurrection
[26:33] forgive me coughing gets me in this time
[26:35] of the year
[26:38] all right
[26:42] now to the ninevites
[26:45] they saw a man walk out
[26:50] right out of the whale's belly
[26:54] all right which would be the sign of the
[26:57] resurrection
[26:59] the lord jesus christ walked out of the
[27:01] tomb
[27:03] the the sign of the resurrection
[27:06] all right now who is this son of man
[27:10] then
[27:14] he's the sign of the resurrection and
[27:16] once you get that where we'll
[27:18] continue on the thought
[27:21] excuse me
[27:24] the son of man is the sign of the
[27:27] resurrection
[27:29] all right now do you believe that amen
[27:32] because that's what he was he was that
[27:35] let's go into scripture and see if
[27:36] that's true
[27:37] all right go ahead with number one on
[27:40] your notes
[27:42] which would be from john
[27:46] and let's look at this for a minute
[27:49] let's think about this resurrection
[27:52] because
[27:53] my main point is to get you to see one
[27:55] thing
[27:57] jesus when he says this watch he says
[28:00] i am the resurrection
[28:04] who's the resurrection the i am amen
[28:08] right the i am is the resurrection sign
[28:12] that's what i want you to get because
[28:14] you can argue about what dates and times
[28:16] and seasons
[28:17] all day long it won't get you nowhere
[28:19] but get what the son of man is
[28:23] because this is the day when the son of
[28:25] man was to be revealed
[28:28] it's the day you and i are living in
[28:30] well what are you looking for the son of
[28:31] man to be revealed
[28:35] i'm looking for a resurrection amen
[28:38] that's right yes sir
[28:39] resurrection comes before rapture
[28:43] wade preached another night honestly
[28:45] resurrection comes before rapture
[28:48] all right and see that resurrection then
[28:52] it's got to be in this day in this hour
[28:54] that we're living
[28:55] that's right so then look what happened
[28:57] in this day
[29:02] here comes a prophet
[29:06] right which would be to you and i
[29:11] uh uh revealing of the word
[29:15] made known into our heart in love
[29:19] the sign
[29:22] or resurrection sign
[29:25] this prophet had the resurrection signed
[29:33] now watch what i'm talking about it
[29:35] wasn't necessarily totally just the
[29:37] gifts and signs and wonders
[29:43] that's part of it but he was bringing us
[29:46] the word
[29:48] now the word is the resurrection amen
[29:54] come on the word is the resurrection
[29:57] because
[29:57] see we got to be raised out of history
[30:01] amen raised from denominationalism
[30:04] and raising it all there and to do that
[30:07] then we must follow
[30:08] into the resurrection so look what
[30:10] happened here
[30:12] and many of the jews john 11
[30:16] and many of the jews come to martha and
[30:18] mary to comfort them
[30:20] concerning their brother because you
[30:22] know what had happened
[30:23] lazarus had died jesus was away
[30:26] he kept going on the way further away
[30:31] you know and then he finally turned and
[30:33] come back
[30:34] now when he comes back then martha and
[30:36] mary's demeaning him and he's
[30:38] concerned but get what he's doing
[30:41] then martha as soon as she heard that
[30:43] jesus was coming
[30:45] when he met him but mary set steel in
[30:48] the house
[30:50] then said martha unto jesus lord if the
[30:53] highest been here
[30:56] my brother had not died now look at
[30:59] her her point
[31:02] but i know that even now
[31:05] whatsoever thou will ask of god god will
[31:08] give it thee
[31:13] all right she made her commitment
[31:18] she believes that whatever he says
[31:21] is going to do it whatever happens going
[31:24] to be
[31:27] all right now watch jesus
[31:30] answered unto her
[31:34] thy brother shall rise again
[31:39] all right there was an argument among
[31:41] the pharisees and the sadducees
[31:43] basically the point is that the
[31:45] sadducees didn't believe in a
[31:47] uh a complete resurrection like the
[31:50] pharisees
[31:51] believed in it you know they kind of had
[31:53] an argument backwards and forth
[31:55] now don't get me wrong and take it in
[31:58] the wrong direction the
[32:00] the sadducees we've made fun of them you
[32:02] know
[32:03] because we said well they were the sad
[32:06] you see
[32:07] because they didn't believe in the
[32:08] resurrection but now they did
[32:12] right they believed in the resurrection
[32:16] but they didn't believe it like the
[32:17] pharisees
[32:20] the pharisees had their concept to the
[32:21] resurrection the sadducees had their
[32:23] concept of it
[32:26] all right it's not if they didn't
[32:29] believe in the resurrection
[32:32] gets a point not if they didn't believe
[32:34] in the resurrection
[32:35] they believed in it but they didn't have
[32:39] it in the correct way
[32:42] so we'd say that more or less the
[32:44] sadducees would
[32:45] have a little different point and and
[32:48] would be doubting
[32:49] uh things to happen in a certain way
[32:54] whereas the pharisees had it figured out
[32:56] that it's going to take place this this
[32:57] is going to take place
[32:58] and it'll be a a resurrection
[33:02] all right but look
[33:08] jesus said and heard thy brother shall
[33:09] rise again
[33:13] because basically everybody believes
[33:18] that's what i said if that come down see
[33:19] you may have picked up that doctrine
[33:21] through the issues in your
[33:22] denominationalism because in the baptist
[33:25] they did they believed basically
[33:27] that you had their sadducees was sad
[33:29] because they didn't believe in the
[33:30] resurrection
[33:31] pharisees was happy because they were
[33:34] you know they were
[33:35] where they believed in it but both of
[33:37] them believed in the resurrection
[33:39] it's just the way they were looking at
[33:41] it see now watch what happened to
[33:44] under give you understanding what
[33:45] happened with with job
[33:50] the job said i know
[33:54] he come to a position or a place that he
[33:56] said i know
[33:59] my redeemer liveth all right
[34:02] see he was looking at the resurrection
[34:07] job was looking at the resurrection
[34:10] because he said i know my redeemer
[34:12] liveth
[34:14] and in the last days
[34:18] he'll appear amen amen well
[34:21] all right now follow the point then
[34:24] martha said unto him i know
[34:27] that he shall rise again in the
[34:30] resurrection
[34:31] at the last days see now what was she
[34:33] looking forward to
[34:37] she wasn't looking listen she wasn't
[34:40] looking at
[34:40] a point that he would raise right there
[34:44] but yet she made her commitment that
[34:46] whatever you do or say
[34:48] it will it will take place
[34:51] but yet her her whole anchor was based
[34:55] upon just that point that whatever he
[34:58] would say
[35:00] and she didn't see the resurrection
[35:02] standing there
[35:05] come on jesus saith unto her
[35:09] i am the resurrection who is the
[35:16] resurrection
[35:17] the i am who's the i am amen
[35:20] the lord jesus christ the son of man the
[35:22] god of glory
[35:25] he was describing to her he said she was
[35:28] looking and said
[35:29] sure sure my brother arrives in the
[35:32] resurrection
[35:33] job see in his early part of his life
[35:35] that's what he had
[35:36] sure sure one of these days is going to
[35:39] be because he was very smart very
[35:41] intelligent
[35:42] but then one day something wrong a bell
[35:44] in the man's life
[35:45] and he said i know my redeemer liveth
[35:51] that he's here right now
[35:55] but look at what was already taking
[35:56] place
[35:58] he was losing his wife i mean his kids
[36:00] he was losing his cattle he was losing
[36:02] his way we're talking about a while ago
[36:03] what was taking place all of that was
[36:05] going on
[36:10] yeah but he said his mind for one time
[36:13] amen
[36:14] he said i know my redeemer does
[36:17] now that word know there is not to just
[36:19] say i know
[36:20] because you can say i know and you're
[36:22] just guessing
[36:24] you know you're just guessing what's
[36:25] taking place but if you really know
[36:29] and job had reached that point see that
[36:31] he knowed
[36:34] that there was going to be a
[36:35] resurrection
[36:38] all right now do you believe that are
[36:40] you set on that do you know there's
[36:42] going to be a resurrection
[36:44] because see we we're not dealing with
[36:46] whether or not it's three days or four
[36:48] hours or six hours or
[36:50] whatever everybody's arguing about you
[36:52] know what happens in the resurrection
[36:54] and
[36:58] she said
[37:01] i know that if you'd have been here my
[37:08] brother wouldn't have died
[37:12] what's that even now
[37:16] i believe that whatever you say
[37:22] that'll be it
[37:25] now watch him anchor it then what did he
[37:27] say jesus saith unto her
[37:30] i am the resurrection
[37:34] she was looking for a resurrection of
[37:36] lazarus right
[37:37] that's what she wanted and she believed
[37:39] that whatever he would say would take
[37:41] place
[37:43] and he said i am the resurrection
[37:50] see now listen
[37:54] this is something that's going to strike
[37:55] some and and some it'll ring a good bell
[37:58] but listen
[38:00] see the i am is the resurrection
[38:05] the i am is the son of man
[38:08] amen
[38:11] the son of man is the resurrection sign
[38:16] the sign of the son of man the scripture
[38:18] we'll call it
[38:22] we may not get that far but if we don't
[38:23] we'll pick it up later even in the last
[38:25] day see that's
[38:26] what it's to be brother branham had the
[38:29] resurrection signed amen
[38:33] come on
[38:39] the dead was raised sick was healed of
[38:42] all things
[38:44] but he had the sign of the resurrection
[38:49] because he was
[38:54] known to be the son of man
[38:57] who demands say i the son of man i am.
[39:00] now come on we know the story
[39:01] brother random's not the son of man come
[39:03] on don't go to sleep on me on that way
[39:06] just keep it in the right order
[39:10] get it like martha got it
[39:18] get what you got because when it
[39:22] finished up she saith unto him
[39:24] yay lord i believe that thou art the
[39:28] christ
[39:31] the son of god which should come into
[39:34] the world
[39:37] she's saying to act to him i believe you
[39:40] are
[39:41] the christ
[39:46] because listen what he's saying to her
[39:48] see jesus said to her i am the
[39:50] resurrection
[39:51] and the life he that believeth in me
[39:53] though he were dead yet shall he live
[39:56] and whosoever liveth and believeth in me
[39:58] shall never die
[39:59] believe us out of this
[40:03] do you believe that see he's asking her
[40:07] does she believe him
[40:09] i'm asking you do we believe him amen
[40:13] see we're in a special age a special
[40:15] time a special part
[40:17] we're not like in the church ages that
[40:19] is coming down that would be the son of
[40:22] god
[40:25] right son of god through the seven
[40:27] church ages
[40:29] but in the last church ages to come back
[40:32] to be the son of man
[40:33] amen that's right amen not brother
[40:35] branham as a
[40:37] god or son of man it's the son of man
[40:39] the word
[40:44] larry stewart she said
[40:47] if you'd have just you know if you'd
[40:50] have just
[40:51] been here
[40:54] so i believe you i've walked with you
[40:57] all of these years
[41:01] i've believed what you taught
[41:07] he said yeah but do you see one thing
[41:12] he says you're looking for a
[41:13] resurrection
[41:15] that's what she was desiring right but
[41:18] he said i'm not looking for a
[41:19] resurrection
[41:22] he said i am the resurrection
[41:27] he said i'm the resurrection itself
[41:31] if you believe these things
[41:35] amen the resurrection of life
[41:39] he that believeth in me though he were
[41:41] dead yet shall he live
[41:43] come on and whosoever liveth and
[41:46] believeth in me shall never die
[41:48] believe us out of this
[41:52] see we're in the days of the son of man
[41:55] right
[41:58] when the day when the son of man would
[42:00] be revealed that's right
[42:02] we can go on over because it takes it on
[42:04] through into the scriptures and go on
[42:06] later
[42:07] we'll pick it up to go on into uh you
[42:10] know
[42:11] after we get out of here
[42:15] after we leave out of here the great
[42:17] sign of the son of man will appear back
[42:19] on earth again right
[42:21] but hey folks we've already had the sign
[42:24] of the son of man
[42:30] that's not brother around being god
[42:33] no it's the sign of the son of man
[42:38] because it's the resurrection sign
[42:42] come on do you believe that it's the
[42:44] resurrection sign
[42:48] i'm i'm sorry for saying things in the
[42:51] wrong way maybe
[42:53] listen when i was the baptist we talked
[42:55] about jesus being the resurrection
[43:02] we didn't understand the son of man we
[43:04] didn't understand
[43:05] the coming forth into the last days it
[43:07] would happen and be
[43:09] that way because we didn't have it in
[43:11] our comprehension
[43:12] it had never been taught to us
[43:15] but we talked about it i remember some
[43:18] ministers meetings and the things
[43:20] after coming on into the message we were
[43:22] having a minister's meeting in a
[43:24] place and and somebody struck out on the
[43:29] resurrection i just asked him
[43:34] i said the son of man's resurrection i
[43:37] said that's the resurrection sign
[43:40] brother branham had the resurrection
[43:42] sign
[43:44] nobody could do as he said what did he
[43:46] say bring me
[43:48] 15 of your worst cases and i'll
[43:50] guarantee you
[43:51] healing for every one of them whereas
[43:53] anybody could say that
[43:58] the only there was the one that could
[44:00] say it was the son of man
[44:03] dwelling in a son of man making manifest
[44:07] the word of god do you understand
[44:11] i remember that day when i was talking
[44:13] like this yesterday
[44:14] and somebody i said don't y'all
[44:16] understand
[44:18] i said brother branham had the
[44:20] resurrection sign
[44:23] amen said he had the resurrection
[44:27] sign in his life
[44:30] death was called forth
[44:34] challenged and defeated
[44:38] because he could say not him himself
[44:42] but he could say the ministry that i
[44:44] have to you
[44:46] is the resurrection
[44:50] you realize how wonderful that is to
[44:52] think about it
[44:56] we're not in the days of the son of god
[44:58] when he would would be dealing with that
[45:00] in the church ages
[45:01] we're in the age of the son of man
[45:05] there is your son of man coming forth
[45:07] which is malachi 4 luke 17 30
[45:09] revelations 10 7.
[45:10] all of those scriptures coming forth
[45:19] he could say if you believe
[45:25] if you believe the prophet could say it
[45:28] amen
[45:29] if you believe all right
[45:33] let's pick up a little bit and read
[45:35] something but you understand
[45:38] jesus said to her he said
[45:41] she said to him if you'd have just been
[45:43] here
[45:45] but yet still i believe you
[45:49] he said all right he said let's see if
[45:52] you believe this he said i am the
[45:58] resurrection
[46:00] the i am is the almighty god
[46:04] not the prophet of god
[46:09] the i am is almighty god in human flesh
[46:15] see why look for the resurrection when
[46:17] we have the resurrection among us
[46:25] right go ahead at number
[46:28] two brothers and just pick up a few of
[46:31] these thoughts
[46:33] just let the prophet answer it
[46:36] in a way from the message greater than
[46:39] solomon
[46:40] is here i didn't want to start preaching
[46:44] i said in this meeting i was going to
[46:46] stand here and talk about divine healing
[46:49] all right let's go back in in horror a
[46:52] wicked and an adult and
[46:54] excuse me divine heal all right let's go
[46:57] back
[46:58] to all right a wicked and an adulterous
[47:00] generation
[47:01] seeketh after us after signs they will
[47:04] receive the sign
[47:05] listen now it doesn't mean they will
[47:10] receive the sign
[47:11] it means the sign will come to them
[47:14] they don't receive it because their
[47:15] denominations ain't going to receive the
[47:17] sign of the son of man
[47:19] only the born-again believers of this
[47:21] message can receive the sign of the son
[47:23] of man are you with me
[47:25] that's how straight i am about it only
[47:27] the born-again believer
[47:29] can come forth to understand only the
[47:32] born-again believer can see that jesus
[47:34] could stand there and say i
[47:35] am the resurrection and the life
[47:39] if you just believe it so listen
[47:43] a wicked and adulterous generation
[47:44] seeketh after signs
[47:47] and they will receive the sign
[47:51] the son of jonas
[47:55] now watch it now jonas laid
[47:58] in the belly of the whale for three days
[48:01] and three nights
[48:02] so much the son of man lay in the heart
[48:04] of the earth
[48:06] for three days and three nights then
[48:08] listen
[48:09] bring it to yourself it may be a little
[48:13] light on the scripture
[48:14] it may be something but it's in the
[48:16] scripture the sign
[48:18] of jonas would be the sign
[48:21] of the resurrection
[48:28] maybe when i started while ago you
[48:30] wouldn't fall in that right we'll follow
[48:32] it now
[48:36] the sign of jonas would be the sign of
[48:38] the resurrection
[48:41] he was in the heart of the earth three
[48:42] days and three nights and he resurrected
[48:44] all right the wicked and adulterous
[48:47] generation
[48:48] that's seeking a sign will get a sign
[48:51] of the resurrection
[48:55] now take it to our day in our time
[49:03] some of you were there and saw
[49:06] the sign of the son of man
[49:12] you saw actually the life the things of
[49:14] sign of the son of man
[49:19] what was that god dealing through a
[49:21] prophet
[49:23] to try to bring us the word because son
[49:26] of man then would go and you get your
[49:28] your concordance and run it through and
[49:29] check how many times in the old
[49:30] testament that it speaks of the son of
[49:32] man
[49:37] what was the son of man word to the
[49:42] people
[49:44] right come on
[49:48] look at number three
[49:52] the third exodus
[49:57] so that's
[50:01] so that's the way it is again today
[50:08] god is calling his elect people
[50:11] and they are elected now and now they
[50:14] are
[50:14] elected for what
[50:19] what are you elected for he said you're
[50:22] elected for a resurrection right and
[50:26] what kind of a sign
[50:27] is he showing them what kind of a sign
[50:30] come to this last day generation
[50:36] who was it the man that they preached
[50:38] the funeral and he said we've seen
[50:40] god walk among us
[50:44] the sign of the son of man amen
[50:51] the resurrection sign
[50:55] god is calling his elected people
[50:58] they're elected now and then
[50:59] and they're elected for what for a
[51:01] resurrection and what kind of a sign
[51:03] is he showing them resurrection sign
[51:06] what was he showing them then
[51:09] a delivering sign to deliver them from
[51:12] the bondage
[51:13] a sign of power that would shut the
[51:15] heavens or could black the skies
[51:18] and now he's showing this power of the
[51:21] resurrection
[51:22] of his son living among them
[51:28] to resurrect them from the grave
[51:31] and graveyard that we're living in that
[51:33] we're in
[51:36] to the land that he's promised to us
[51:39] resurrection sign calling out of
[51:42] spiritual egypt
[51:45] in babylon resurrection sign
[51:51] how happy you and i should be amen
[51:56] to consider the fact that we've had an
[51:58] opportunity
[52:02] and i said some of you were there
[52:05] well it was taking place
[52:09] you saw the dead raised
[52:12] you saw the sick healed you saw the word
[52:16] being revealed
[52:22] well shouldn't we be to the place basis
[52:24] then of saying at least like martha
[52:30] lord
[52:33] if you'd have just been here
[52:38] my brother wouldn't have died
[52:43] she said i believe this i believe it i
[52:44] believe yeah there'll be a resurrection
[52:46] yes he's going to raise one of these
[52:48] days after
[52:50] 4 000 years 6 000 years or so he's going
[52:52] to raise
[53:00] but he said listen what are you looking
[53:02] so far off
[53:04] why are you trying to figure it out i
[53:06] said you're not doing no more than an
[53:07] argument
[53:08] of whether it was three days four days
[53:10] or whatever you understand that was
[53:12] split among the denominations
[53:14] of whether jesus was crucified one of
[53:16] them says that he was crucified on
[53:18] thursday
[53:19] and then had to go and had to hang
[53:21] around raised late saturday afternoon
[53:23] and had that to make it fit and had to
[53:25] come forth and
[53:27] and be able to be raised on you know
[53:28] fourth and appeared
[53:31] on sunday morning
[53:35] we see your prophet come in said he was
[53:37] crucified on friday
[53:42] now do you believe it he was crucified
[53:44] on friday
[53:47] and the bible said he was raised early
[53:50] the first day of the week
[53:51] he didn't have to hang around he was
[53:53] busy
[53:55] he was down in hell getting all of that
[53:57] taken care of and
[53:58] bumping the devil around and doing all
[54:00] the things and showing amen
[54:02] and then he come forth in the
[54:03] resurrection
[54:08] what about you and me
[54:13] we could at least be like mary that
[54:15] would say yes lord i believe if you
[54:16] would just have been here
[54:18] but even now i still have an
[54:20] understanding of you
[54:21] that if you'll just call for it
[54:28] he said i don't have to call
[54:32] he said i'm the resurrection myself
[54:37] said if you just believe that right
[54:39] that's right
[54:41] everything would be taken care of all
[54:43] your sicknesses heart acts and troubles
[54:45] are taken care of if you can believe
[54:47] that you
[54:48] you can stand and believe and say that
[54:51] he is the resurrection amen
[54:58] and that prophet brought this word unto
[55:00] us
[55:03] the sign of the son of man the sign of
[55:06] the resurrection
[55:07] is what i'm getting at he had the sign
[55:10] of the son of man right
[55:12] that's right because he could call forth
[55:14] and the dead was raised sick healed
[55:15] sign of the son of man that's the
[55:17] resurrection sign
[55:22] that's the sign we all need it's to
[55:24] realize what's taking place
[55:27] go ahead to the next one
[55:31] what kind of a sign would a wicked and
[55:33] an adulterous generation find out
[55:38] the resurrection sign and that's what we
[55:41] are promised today
[55:45] the resurrection sign that he is still
[55:47] alive
[55:48] he is the same yesterday today and
[55:50] forever
[55:53] he said as it was in the days of lot
[55:57] as we went through it last night in the
[56:00] days of lot what happened in the days of
[56:02] lot
[56:03] so would it be at the coming of the son
[56:05] of man
[56:06] these things we are promised many more
[56:09] scriptures
[56:10] to keep from taking you know taking up
[56:13] time
[56:13] a little while in the world see it won't
[56:16] see me no more
[56:18] cosmos because what is over he's the
[56:20] same yesterday today and forever
[56:24] you and i should be the happiest people
[56:26] to ever be thought of
[56:28] because we've seen even though i didn't
[56:31] was not there so i said some of you were
[56:34] there
[56:36] the bible says you know talking about
[56:39] and says and some
[56:40] are still alive among us
[56:44] there's some still sitting here today
[56:46] alive among us
[56:48] that saw these things you saw the sign
[56:51] of the son of man
[56:57] but come on what did you see the
[56:59] resurrection
[57:01] amen
[57:09] he said what is who is this son of man
[57:11] in the beginning was the word word is
[57:12] with god and the word was god
[57:15] that's what your prophet said
[57:18] a sign of the son of man amen
[57:25] god living among mankind go ahead to the
[57:28] nation
[57:33] voice of the signs look jonah the
[57:36] prophet
[57:37] look at that sign he was on his road to
[57:40] sarcasm
[57:41] started to go to nineveh and took a road
[57:43] to tarsus
[57:44] many condemned jonah and jonah don't
[57:46] deserve to be condemned
[57:48] he was a prophet the footsteps of the
[57:50] righteous are ordered of the lord
[57:53] jump on down then what notice he said as
[57:55] jonah was in the valley of the whale
[57:57] three days and three nights
[57:59] it was to be a sign so must the son of
[58:04] man
[58:05] be in the heart of the earth three days
[58:08] and three nights
[58:09] and a wicked and adulterous generation
[58:12] seeketh after a sign
[58:14] and there shall be no sign given them
[58:17] from god
[58:18] now do you follow what i'm saying while
[58:19] ago it's
[58:21] for them but they won't receive it
[58:24] they won't accept it it's coming from
[58:26] god
[58:29] come on there shall be no sign given
[58:32] them
[58:33] from god remember but the sign of jonas
[58:36] what is jonah's sign the resurrection
[58:42] and this is that sodom generation
[58:45] adulterous
[58:46] spiritual adultery and all what they'll
[58:50] get it
[58:51] amen the sign of the resurrection
[58:55] see people are not listening to do you
[58:57] realize what's going to happen
[58:59] very quickly
[59:04] you realize that time is running out
[59:08] you realize something's got to take
[59:09] place i'm not a doomsday preacher never
[59:12] been that
[59:12] i've always preached but i've always
[59:14] preached to you a not a future thing or
[59:16] a past thing i've always preached to you
[59:19] but present tense
[59:20] because to me the present tense is the
[59:22] resurrection
[59:26] when he said i am the resurrection he
[59:28] would stand in our present tense
[59:30] he wasn't talking to the future or what
[59:32] had happened with
[59:33] with lazarus
[59:39] the sign of the son of man
[59:46] is the resurrection sign
[59:54] okay continue on fourth of the sign
[59:58] the next one excuse me identification
[1:00:03] but now what somebody of us says could
[1:00:05] jesus be
[1:00:06] in birmingham then tonight yes sir they
[1:00:09] promised he would
[1:00:10] how would he be here in the form of what
[1:00:14] the holy spirit that's what he is saying
[1:00:16] yesterday today and forever
[1:00:18] he's in the form of the holy spirit now
[1:00:21] i wish
[1:00:23] i had time to inject one more thought
[1:00:25] here
[1:00:26] but i probably won't but let me
[1:00:29] get it it's just quick will you
[1:00:32] you suffer women for a few minutes
[1:00:35] i don't want to keep you too late and
[1:00:37] miss your buses listen
[1:00:39] jesus said in saint luke the 16th
[1:00:42] chapter
[1:00:43] or 17th chapter as it was in the days
[1:00:46] of lot so shall it be in the coming of
[1:00:48] the son of man
[1:00:50] did he say that congregation what what
[1:00:54] right along in there he was reading the
[1:00:56] same bible
[1:00:58] watch watch the setting of lot and what
[1:01:01] a sinful nation it was
[1:01:03] what a sinful what a sinful place look
[1:01:05] what
[1:01:06] we're in today look what did he say a
[1:01:09] sinful generation is going to seek after
[1:01:11] signs and wonder
[1:01:12] what are they going to get save time's
[1:01:14] reading roll it up look
[1:01:16] son of man the resurrection sign this
[1:01:19] adulterous generation would receive
[1:01:22] the resurrection sign but brother
[1:01:25] branham
[1:01:26] you're saying they're going to receive
[1:01:28] it not receive it
[1:01:29] as a for themselves
[1:01:35] but the little bride will receive it for
[1:01:37] herself
[1:01:41] thank god for the resurrection sign
[1:01:46] in this last days the resurrection sign
[1:01:54] it's coming forth
[1:01:58] some still here that was there when he
[1:02:00] was here
[1:02:01] and saw the great things some are now
[1:02:04] saying
[1:02:09] it won't be long
[1:02:12] i'm not a doomsday i'm not a a a person
[1:02:16] that just throws out all these things
[1:02:18] but listen
[1:02:20] son of man the resurrection signed this
[1:02:22] adulterous generation would receive it
[1:02:27] they won't receive it as a redemptive
[1:02:31] get what he's saying they don't receive
[1:02:33] it as a redemptive form
[1:02:35] they receive it as the basis that they
[1:02:38] were glad to hear
[1:02:39] to have the prophet among them they were
[1:02:41] glad to have the lord jesus among them
[1:02:44] when he was walking on the
[1:02:45] shores of galilee feeding the sick you
[1:02:47] know healing the sick feeding the people
[1:02:49] and doing all the things they were glad
[1:02:51] to have there but yet they didn't go on
[1:02:53] with it
[1:02:54] amen do you understand what he's saying
[1:02:57] this end time is to receive the
[1:03:00] resurrection sign
[1:03:01] but they won't take it
[1:03:05] you think they're going to turn down
[1:03:06] their churches and things and take this
[1:03:09] message of the hour no
[1:03:16] no they won't do it
[1:03:19] why because they're they're not set for
[1:03:21] that but the bride is
[1:03:23] amen right let's keep saying
[1:03:26] at least we could be like martha to say
[1:03:29] lord
[1:03:35] i know even now
[1:03:40] that whatever you say
[1:03:44] well you know i've preached
[1:03:47] for 50 years
[1:03:51] and my whole thought for the 50 years
[1:03:53] that i've been preaching has been one
[1:03:54] thing
[1:03:56] because your prophetess once said it
[1:03:59] that the bride of jesus christ
[1:04:01] would be the son of man
[1:04:05] now how many more services do you need
[1:04:07] on that that the bride of jesus christ
[1:04:09] would be the son of man
[1:04:12] the lord jesus christ upon earth
[1:04:16] in human flesh again
[1:04:20] there's your resurrection
[1:04:24] there's the sign that i'm looking for
[1:04:27] it's for me and you to come to a basis
[1:04:29] that we can believe it and stand on it
[1:04:32] and then no matter what takes place we
[1:04:34] just
[1:04:35] okay let me be like martha
[1:04:40] let me at least say well lord i can
[1:04:42] believe you
[1:04:48] the sign of the resurrection is given to
[1:04:51] the church
[1:04:53] in the last days
[1:04:56] pull that one up number six
[1:05:00] queen of sheba
[1:05:05] all right drop down about the middle but
[1:05:08] the resurrection will be the sign
[1:05:10] and the resurrection sign is given to
[1:05:12] the church
[1:05:14] in this last days the angel of the holy
[1:05:17] spirit
[1:05:18] in the meet in the meetings showing the
[1:05:21] same thing

[1:05:25] across the nation proving that jesus
[1:05:27] christ has raised from the dead
[1:05:29] just the same yesterday today and
[1:05:31] forever that's the generation
[1:05:35] that will receive it
[1:05:38] who those who believe it
[1:05:44] those who believe it

[1:06:34] well i i i've never heard it maybe i've
[1:06:36] never never considered the thoughts or
[1:06:39] what kind of a sign would this wicked
[1:06:41] and adulterous generation
[1:06:46] the sign of the son of man
[1:06:50] that's what we find now christ

[1:10:00] jesus christ as the son of man
[1:10:02] but he was a son of man that the son of
[1:10:05] man could come down and live in
