[36:49] you see him in the word hold on brother
[36:51] here we're going to sing a song in just
[36:53] a minute but I was thinking something
[36:56] you know
[36:57] this morning
[36:59] and you know if you want to know
[37:02] the the weather forecast you generally
[37:05] turn on the computers now and you can
[37:07] just run it through and see what it's
[37:08] going to be for the next month whatever
[37:11] but I got to thinking about that you
[37:12] know you don't never want to call the
[37:15] devil about what the weather's going to
[37:18] be he'll always give you a bad
[37:21] report right it's either too hot it's
[37:25] too cold it's too w it's too dry it's
[37:28] too this it's too that so don't ever ask
[37:30] the devil what the weather report is you
[37:33] know you call God to ask what it is
[37:37] that's right all right and he says well
[37:40] it may be hot today but said that's good
[37:42] for the bringing the seed out and make
[37:44] them grow it may be wet today but said
[37:47] that's got to have that for the moisture
[37:49] it may be a little windy but you know
[37:51] that's to blow away all this old pollen
[37:53] you know and all this stuff so now which
[37:55] one are you asking about the weather
[37:58] report I like that you say what in the
[38:01] world do you mean I mean why is it that
[38:06] always you know you we saying we're
[38:09] feeling so bad we're so down we're
[38:12] having so many troubles and I know we
[38:16] do true we
[38:19] do but when you call me what do I
[38:23] say I said well everything's great
[38:27] right no matter how sick I am what is it
[38:30] everything's
[38:31] great well you know now let's just sing
[38:34] that I am blessed because the other day
[38:36] I was going down to see brother going

[45:15] okay all right I think that's all the
[45:17] announcements I miss
[45:19] any all right let's turn to Ephesians
[45:24] 1 and Matthew
[45:28] 19 Ephesians 1 and Matthew
[45:33] 19 Matthew says that little boy is going
[45:36] to be a Matthew going to be ace Matthew
[45:39] or Matthew Ace ain't figured out which
[45:41] way going yet on it but he says that's
[45:43] going to be a little boy and if it's not
[45:46] it's going to be Matas I guess or
[45:49] something he's already got it figured
[45:52] out that name Matt is going to be their
[45:56] you know for sure and all of that but
[45:59] okay all right so that'll be in Matthew
[46:01] 19 father we thank you for the day and
[46:03] we love you and we surely truly know
[46:05] that we are blessed amen what a
[46:07] wonderful thing it is to know that we
[46:09] are Christians living in an hour in a
[46:12] time when the world is falling apart and
[46:14] everything is is going to powder and to
[46:17] see the world and the way it's going
[46:19] Lord but to realize that we knew way
[46:22] ahead of time what's going to take place
[46:24] and we know that we're programed to know
[46:26] these things and to see these things
[46:28] before they come to pass so there's no
[46:30] surprise to us to see how the world
[46:33] condition is existing now and Lord we
[46:36] just ask you to help us and give us
[46:39] Grace to stand within the hour of the
[46:41] time that we are to stand upon this
[46:43] Earth and to be the Bride of Jesus
[46:45] Christ we ask you now that you would
[46:47] just come and Lord as we speak your word
[46:50] that you would do as you said in your
[46:52] word you said you sent your word and
[46:53] healed us and delivered us from destru
[46:55] ction the prophet was reading the other
[46:57] day said that you did not have to heal
[47:00] to prove your
[47:02] power but you did have to heal to prove
[47:05] your word so then we depend upon your
[47:08] word and we thank you and just have your
[47:10] way now forgive our sins lead us in
[47:13] thine understanding and keep us in Jesus
[47:16] name amen all
[47:19] right remember those announcements and
[47:22] brother Joe's got them on the computer
[47:24] if you need them to
[47:26] to be able to follow uh
[47:31] therein okay Ephesians 1:3 blessed be
[47:35] the God and father of our Lord Jesus
[47:37] Christ who ha blessed us with all
[47:38] spiritual blessings in Heavenly places
[47:41] in Christ according as he had chosen Us
[47:44] in him before the foundation of the
[47:46] world that we should be holy and Without
[47:48] Blame before him in love having
[47:50] predestinated us unto the adoption of
[47:53] children by Jesus Christ to himself
[47:55] Accord according to the good pleasure of
[47:57] his will to the praise of the glory of
[47:59] his grace wherein he hath made us
[48:01] accepted in the Beloved in whom we have
[48:04] Redemption through his blood the
[48:06] Forgiveness of sins according to the
[48:08] riches of his grace wherein Heath
[48:11] abounded toward us in all wisdom and
[48:12] Prudence having made known unto us the
[48:15] mystery of his will according to his
[48:17] good pleasure which he had purposed in
[48:20] himself that in the dispensation of the
[48:22] fullness of times he might gather
[48:24] together in one all things in Christ
[48:27] both which are in heaven and which are
[48:29] on earth even in him in whom also we
[48:32] have obtained an inheritance being
[48:34] predestinated according to the purpose
[48:36] of him who worketh all things after the
[48:40] counsel of his own will that we should
[48:43] be to the praise of his glory who first
[48:46] trusted in Christ now let's go back to
[48:49] Matthew because the thought will be
[48:50] coming from here to this point and it'll
[48:53] be from Matthew 19:16
[48:57] and this is actually the Rich Young
[48:58] Ruler Etc coming to Jesus and behold one
[49:03] came and said unto him good Master what
[49:07] good thing shall I
[49:09] do that I may have eternal life you may
[49:13] be seated the Lord add his Blessing to
[49:15] the reading of the
[49:19] word now I don't know how far we'll get
[49:21] with the notes and using them and things
[49:24] but we will try to
[49:26] to cover as much as we
[49:31] can now
[49:34] this last weekend we were talking
[49:37] about the germ of
[49:41] life and we know and realize that no
[49:44] matter what anything does uh they can
[49:47] make a a grain of wheat it looks so
[49:50] perfect and it makes just as much bread
[49:54] makes just as many cherries and cereal
[49:56] and things like that as you know
[49:59] anything with true life but the one
[50:02] thing is
[50:03] missing which is the germ of life
[50:07] because science cannot create the germ
[50:10] of life I was talking to Brother Richard
[50:12] Wilson this morning and it really just
[50:14] struck me up in the morning I were
[50:16] thinking about it and uh you know you
[50:19] can
[50:20] take science today can take the ever
[50:24] what you call it the egg from from the
[50:25] female The Germ from the male or
[50:27] whatever you want to call them great big
[50:29] word sperms
[50:30] Etc and uh you know they can take that
[50:34] and they can actually put it together
[50:37] and and really put it into another
[50:40] person you know and have the third party
[50:45] producing the birth of a child well now
[50:49] that is beyond
[50:50] anything uh sensible as far as our
[50:53] reasoning thinks so it's actually a
[50:57] miracle to think about what they can do
[51:00] and your prophet of God said that man
[51:02] has broken into God's
[51:05] laboratory all right now they cannot
[51:08] create
[51:10] life they cannot make the woman have the
[51:13] baby no matter if she has the
[51:16] egg they can't make the man produce a
[51:19] child no matter if he does have the
[51:22] germ it has to be brought together into
[51:25] the condition in existence to be able to
[51:28] bring forth you know a a child all right
[51:33] now in that then if the germ of life is
[51:37] not there you heard the prophet over and
[51:39] over and over talking about these things
[51:42] that no matter how much the the hen can
[51:44] lay no matter how many eggs but if she's
[51:46] not been with the male the eggs will not
[51:49] be will not produce because that they're
[51:52] not
[51:53] gerti see they do not how of The Germ of
[51:56] Life all right now The Germ of life is
[52:00] so
[52:02] small until science cannot find
[52:07] it now you say well now they can do this
[52:09] they can do that but they can't find the
[52:11] germ of
[52:12] life now you can look back in there and
[52:14] see a bud coming forth
[52:17] yes but you cannot find the uh you know
[52:22] the The Germ of
[52:24] life right and this is what's so
[52:27] amazing that actually The Germ of life
[52:30] of a gat you know how small a gat is you
[52:33] know little bitty minute pain you know
[52:36] that the germ of life is the same size
[52:38] for a n as it is for an
[52:41] elephant you
[52:44] know see we you know we look at
[52:48] something and try to figure it out it
[52:49] can't be cuz you can't see the life of
[52:51] the The Germ of life for the elephant no
[52:53] more than you could find it for the nap
[52:55] or the the small sugar that we have
[52:58] around here that you know it's just
[53:00] almost impossible to see it you know and
[53:03] things but you know what it still has a
[53:05] heart it still has the ability to live
[53:07] and Etc because God gave it to it but my
[53:11] point of what I'm talking about is that
[53:13] germ of
[53:15] life if it's not in you and
[53:18] I then you
[53:21] know we would not be here naturally see
[53:25] and we are the multiplication of that
[53:28] natural germ of life and the prophet
[53:30] said as we were trying to cover there
[53:32] you on I don't want that away from your
[53:33] mind I wanted to stay with you
[53:37] that if we don't have the germ of
[53:41] life he said there's no way that we
[53:44] could have ever have or come to eternal
[53:48] life all right we'll get back to some of
[53:50] the things because it's not the person
[53:52] that comes predestinated eternally right
[53:55] from God it's the word of seed right see
[53:59] and if we don't have
[54:01] that then there's no way to ever come to
[54:05] eternal
[54:06] life now it's always been in man like
[54:09] the Rich Young Ruler as reading there
[54:12] man has always wondered about eternal
[54:15] life of course now in the message they
[54:18] got the answer we always had
[54:22] it you know we always had
[54:26] well you know then that way let's just
[54:28] take this old Bible that we've been
[54:29] reading and talking about Nicodemus and
[54:32] Jesus said you must be born again and
[54:33] all this that and the other let's just
[54:35] burn the thing and just chunk it away
[54:37] and forget it you know because we've got
[54:40] such a great Revelation now until we
[54:44] don't need the the Bible or or or
[54:47] anything and and and we don't need the
[54:49] message or the hour that the prophet
[54:52] would tell you that you must be born
[54:56] again see we just don't need that if we
[54:58] always you know have eternal life so
[55:01] that's what we want to deal with is a
[55:03] point today about that but I want you to
[55:05] think on it this way
[55:09] that that germ of
[55:16] Life the only way that it can be in us
[55:20] without God being a respector of persons
[55:26] you know are
[55:55] able to land and who would receive it
[55:57] and be like in the The Parables of the
[56:00] the you know to the disciples there that
[56:02] they were talking you know about the
[56:04] seed falling in the ground this goes
[56:05] here that goes there you know cares of
[56:07] Life taking it but the word says there
[56:10] one of them says they took the word and
[56:11] they held it right you know they held it
[56:16] in other words they cherished
[56:18] it so what's the difference
[56:21] in all of us all of us have an
[56:24] opportunity that's right as I've tried
[56:27] to make it plain over and over God
[56:29] doesn't do anything according to his own
[56:33] wanting of
[56:36] desires he does it according to his forn
[56:38] knowledge so never get away from that
[56:41] thought that's right because the prophet
[56:43] said
[56:45] what
[56:46] predestination or
[56:49] election either one you cover looks back
[56:53] to for knowledge that's right all right
[56:57] so then as I covered to you over and
[56:58] over for knowledge must be first right
[57:02] that's right if predestination means the
[57:05] destiny of mankind upon the Earth and I
[57:08] believe that is exactly the way God done
[57:10] it but he predestinated it not on the
[57:13] basis that one person could be saved and
[57:16] another person couldn't be saved right
[57:19] he predestinated it on the basis of that
[57:24] he
[57:25] fornew right all right now he
[57:29] fornew who would want to be saved
[57:35] yes and who would not want to be saved
[57:38] that's correct all right now everybody
[57:41] follow that cuz I want to make sure you
[57:42] follow that what I'm saying on this germ
[57:44] of life before we continue on in
[57:48] thought see because if God doesn't Forno
[57:53] then what kind of a god do we serve
[57:55] right well maybe he might know some
[57:58] things well then you got to maybe so God
[58:00] that's right y you don't have an
[58:03] eternal
[58:05] infinite all knowing God Amen your God
[58:09] is your own
[58:11] belly you say no it's not well your
[58:14] belly is run by your mind so that's
[58:17] whatever it is in other words you're in
[58:19] it for the money you're in it for the
[58:21] the uh whatever the popularities the the
[58:24] things that you desire instead of being
[58:27] in it to try to help somebody see about
[58:29] God you see like I said everybody's
[58:31] always wanted to find out about eternal
[58:35] life and if you're wanting to find out
[58:37] about eternal life then it means that
[58:40] one that there must be an eternal life
[58:42] to find out about right number two means
[58:45] that you don't have it
[58:48] right that doesn't need a great
[58:50] Revelation does it that just simply we
[58:54] believe in it and understanding it as
[58:58] human Mortals mankind has always wanted
[59:00] to find out about God in his ways
[59:04] so you know and we're wanting to go as
[59:08] the old Indian called it to the Happy
[59:10] Hunting Ground the the this group calls
[59:13] it a great big thing here and this group
[59:14] calls it that way but everybody wants to
[59:17] know about eternal
[59:20] life well that means as I said number
[59:23] one there is an eternal life to do
[59:25] because you could not want something if
[59:27] it's not there to pull
[59:29] it and number two is that you don't have
[59:33] it
[59:35] right well brother D what about the
[59:38] quotes of the Prophet well all
[59:41] right what about it you know the point
[59:44] is that he can't make one thing in one
[59:48] place and something else in another so
[59:51] you know if we leave it Al long enough
[59:54] it'll come
[59:55] together all right and and we can
[59:58] understand it but what were we talking
[1:00:00] about the germ of
[1:00:04] life God's for
[1:00:07] knowledge allowed him to look all the
[1:00:10] way down through the time on earth
[1:00:14] right and as it did then he could see
[1:00:17] who would want to be
[1:00:20] saved and who would not want to be saved
[1:00:23] h and in doing that then he could
[1:00:27] determine or
[1:00:30] predestinate then which is Destiny
[1:00:32] determined or set beforehand see see
[1:00:36] there's nothing wrong with
[1:00:38] predestination amen you approach it by
[1:00:40] the forn knowledge of God and then you
[1:00:42] can can walk upon that and that's what I
[1:00:45] said though in the message there the
[1:00:46] other day I said we're afraid of for
[1:00:48] knowledge cuz see for knowledge has to
[1:00:51] do with knowing what you will do we want
[1:00:54] want it to be upon some form of some
[1:00:57] magic trick that we've lived like the
[1:00:59] devil you know all of our life and all
[1:01:01] at once right before we die we want to
[1:01:03] over you know and the last few hours
[1:01:06] Maybe not maybe not too many hours cuz
[1:01:09] we don't want to go too far with this
[1:01:10] you know but maybe the last couple of
[1:01:12] hours that we're living we can click
[1:01:14] over and live like God you know and then
[1:01:17] we just step over into glory and and
[1:01:19] just have a wonderful you know that's
[1:01:22] that's our thought see we're afraid
[1:01:27] of what we
[1:01:28] are and what we think you remember I
[1:01:31] tried to get that point
[1:01:32] across see we're afraid of forn
[1:01:34] knowledge because it does determine and
[1:01:37] is dealing with what you're
[1:01:39] doing but see then by God's for
[1:01:42] knowledge he would be able to look down
[1:01:45] and see who would want to be
[1:01:47] saved see and like the little woman at
[1:01:50] the
[1:01:53] whale that would you know say we we you
[1:01:57] know in other words the prophet said
[1:01:58] like it he said she knew the
[1:02:00] scriptures she says we know the Messiah
[1:02:03] right comth she knew the
[1:02:06] Bible you know she she had studied that
[1:02:10] much of it and she knew it and like he
[1:02:12] said then because of the religious
[1:02:14] system of the world that didn't have
[1:02:16] anything to hold her she turned into
[1:02:17] being a prostitution you know and went
[1:02:19] out the wrong way because there was
[1:02:22] nothing in the church that was any good
[1:02:24] right
[1:02:26] and you look around what is it in the
[1:02:27] churches this that's worth anything oh
[1:02:29] yeah big programs big this big givings
[1:02:32] big going big doing y yeah but what
[1:02:35] about the word right amen what about the
[1:02:38] word that's
[1:02:40] right okay now see then by God's for
[1:02:46] knowledge he could actually put in you
[1:02:48] if he wanted to I don't deal with that
[1:02:51] putting in you and the seed sticking man
[1:02:53] wants to draw it out cuz that's what
[1:02:54] tantalizes people's mind right amen you
[1:02:58] know I mean it tantalizes the mind to
[1:03:00] take a draw and to be able to draw
[1:03:03] something there you know and then put a
[1:03:06] spot and then oh I can relate to that
[1:03:09] you know but what do you need all that
[1:03:13] far when you just believe God's word
[1:03:16] that's right all right and see then what
[1:03:19] is that germ of
[1:03:23] life now as I said it's no different for
[1:03:27] the elephant than it is for the NAT so
[1:03:31] it's not something that you can find
[1:03:34] right it's not a
[1:03:37] spot because there is no way if if the
[1:03:41] germ of life in a a a peach or whatever
[1:03:45] you know a person or a human The Germ of
[1:03:48] life if science can't find
[1:03:52] it then it can't be a spot cuz if it was
[1:03:56] a spot they could find
[1:03:59] it right yeah you you're thinking with
[1:04:03] me just
[1:04:04] sensibly see then people wants to deal
[1:04:07] with some kind of something put in
[1:04:09] you I had this down in here yeah that's
[1:04:12] what Napoleon says you
[1:04:14] know walked around you know he thought
[1:04:17] and reincarnations and believing and
[1:04:19] this and that and the other you know
[1:04:21] thought he'd been here before and that's
[1:04:24] what people thinks you know well it's
[1:04:26] just some way that I believe now your
[1:04:27] Prophet said that it's totally gone from
[1:04:30] your
[1:04:31] mind right all
[1:04:34] right now you if we're going to believe
[1:04:37] what he says then we can't come back up
[1:04:39] with something to say well you know I
[1:04:41] just believe I feel like I was before
[1:04:43] the world now the prophet said it's gone
[1:04:46] from your mind
[1:04:47] right now we're going to believe him
[1:04:49] about acts 238 but we're not going to
[1:04:51] believe him about that well I'll tell
[1:04:53] you what do I just kind of believe I
[1:04:55] just kind of feel like I D see now
[1:04:57] you're getting into a propped up you
[1:05:00] know situation there's no need of it
[1:05:03] that's right the devil will come along
[1:05:05] slap you for a loop and you you you
[1:05:06] can't stand on a propped up thing but
[1:05:09] but the word of God that stand there and
[1:05:11] I told you I use the law of
[1:05:15] elimination we're talking about that
[1:05:17] last night in the Bible study a little I
[1:05:18] use the law of elimination in in I like
[1:05:22] brother hter used to say if a equals B
[1:05:24] and it's it's common sense to know b and
[1:05:26] a is the same thing right you that's
[1:05:29] that's sensible that's no problem right
[1:05:32] but you see the law of
[1:05:38] elimination it says to me like
[1:05:42] this quotes from people see I always was
[1:05:51] eternal but then the law of elimin ation
[1:05:54] sets forth in me to
[1:05:57] wonder if I always was
[1:06:00] eternal then why would I seek after
[1:06:04] eternal life right
[1:06:07] right and why would the devil have such
[1:06:09] an upper hand about me you know in the
[1:06:13] doings you
[1:06:15] know if I always was when I quote of the
[1:06:18] Prophet amen I believe it and I know I
[1:06:22] believe he knows what he's talking about
[1:06:23] that's right right but according to the
[1:06:25] law of elimination if I have something I
[1:06:28] don't need
[1:06:29] it right
[1:06:33] sensible if I always was eternal then
[1:06:36] Jesus Christ never had to die right
[1:06:40] there's no reason for him to come into
[1:06:41] the world
[1:06:44] right but
[1:06:46] yet he did
[1:06:49] come and that law of elimination then
[1:06:52] eliminates our ideas
[1:06:54] cuz you'd have to rewrite the Bible as I
[1:06:56] said about Nicodemus you'd have to say
[1:06:58] that Jesus said to Nicodemus just
[1:07:00] Nicodemus all you got to do is just know
[1:07:02] who you are you got to believe well he
[1:07:05] done a pretty good job believing he put
[1:07:07] his life on the line he put his job on
[1:07:08] the line if they caught Nicodemus coming
[1:07:10] to Jesus what do you think his buddies
[1:07:13] would have done with
[1:07:15] him all right but the the point is I'm
[1:07:18] trying to get you to
[1:07:20] see that God can look down
[1:07:25] and see that you would want eternal life
[1:07:29] that's
[1:07:31] right and if you want eternal
[1:07:35] life no then it would be
[1:07:38] necessary that he had it there for
[1:07:43] you okay it would mean that he'd have to
[1:07:47] provide away and he
[1:07:49] has all right and he provided that way
[1:07:53] through Jesus Christ Christ Our Lord
[1:07:55] see and there's a lot speaking of in the
[1:07:59] scripture run a little reference
[1:08:00] sometime on eternal
[1:08:02] life you got probably about um 15 times
[1:08:06] that it talks about I'm talking about
[1:08:08] eternal life you know and
[1:08:13] see Jesus said one day he said search
[1:08:16] the
[1:08:19] scriptures for in them what he said you
[1:08:27] think you have eternal
[1:08:32] life all right see mankind as I said
[1:08:35] he's always wanted to deal with
[1:08:38] it his thoughts has always been not to
[1:08:41] to he wants to live in this world yes
[1:08:43] and he'd love to live in this world
[1:08:45] eternally you know and never have a
[1:08:48] thing but he knows no matter what you
[1:08:50] think about yourself you can look in the
[1:08:52] mirror and you can you can stand in
[1:08:54] there and you can do like this and like
[1:08:56] I told you there's more muscle strained
[1:08:58] by people looking in the mirror than
[1:08:59] they are lifting
[1:09:01] weights and that's not a joke that's a
[1:09:04] truth cuz you you
[1:09:07] know but you can look in the mirror and
[1:09:09] you can look up there brother col can
[1:09:10] look in that mirror and he can say man I
[1:09:13] ain't a day over why you
[1:09:18] li he just lying to
[1:09:21] himself I can still do everything I
[1:09:24] could ever do you're
[1:09:27] lying you're
[1:09:29] dying so then the point after a while
[1:09:32] see you may PP yourself up for a while
[1:09:34] you know and think it's doing pretty
[1:09:36] good but in after a while reality sets
[1:09:39] in and then what do you start thinking
[1:09:41] about life after
[1:09:44] death right it changes from living to
[1:09:48] life after death and then you start
[1:09:51] realizing hey I better be concerned
[1:09:54] about the
[1:09:55] future you the Rich Young Ruler you've
[1:09:58] heard the prophet he was a great man
[1:10:00] done all these great
[1:10:02] things but one day he got a concern
[1:10:06] about eternal life that's
[1:10:08] true what about me and you so what is
[1:10:12] the germ of life this God's for
[1:10:16] knowledge as I said down and I know the
[1:10:20] quotes of the
[1:10:22] Prophet that's fine
[1:10:24] but quotes will kill you that's right if
[1:10:27] you don't have a
[1:10:29] revelation now science cannot and your
[1:10:33] Prophet gave it about five times I was
[1:10:34] looking this morning he said science
[1:10:37] can't find the germ of
[1:10:40] life that's
[1:10:42] right well science says they can't find
[1:10:46] it you know I mean I I don't understand
[1:10:50] the germ of Life do
[1:10:51] you yeah
[1:10:54] I mean we got a beautiful
[1:10:57] garden and you know there's not a weed
[1:11:01] in your
[1:11:03] garden and you go out and you say well
[1:11:05] the neighbor he's cleaning out his
[1:11:07] chicken house a lot of people wouldn't
[1:11:08] know what that is but just cleaning out
[1:11:10] a building you know and putting the
[1:11:12] compost upon your ground you know and uh
[1:11:16] you'd say well you know man I've got a
[1:11:19] beautiful garden there's no weeds
[1:11:20] whatsoever but they say that chicken
[1:11:23] litter as we call it here in the South
[1:11:25] you
[1:11:26] know that it will really grow stuff
[1:11:31] good we make the statement it'll grow
[1:11:33] grass on a rock and that's about true
[1:11:35] you know if you get a little moisture to
[1:11:36] it but you know you go put that on your
[1:11:41] garden and the next year you got all
[1:11:44] kind of weeds right now where' they come
[1:11:47] from you didn't S no wheat
[1:11:50] seed
[1:11:52] right
[1:11:54] I mean you didn't go out there and say
[1:11:55] well I need some crab graice and I need
[1:11:59] this and see the
[1:12:02] chicken now the chicken itself never ate
[1:12:05] no crab
[1:12:06] GP
[1:12:08] right right that's right they didn't
[1:12:11] feed crab gra to the
[1:12:13] chicken but in the ground up
[1:12:15] seeds was crab gr seeds that's why you
[1:12:18] get it right and there's no way to see
[1:12:21] it within would we want a comparison to
[1:12:25] try to make it that I was born with this
[1:12:29] seed in
[1:12:34] me I asked a brother a simple question
[1:12:37] one time CU that's the way I like to do
[1:12:39] things I like to ask what I think is
[1:12:41] very simple question and I said the seed
[1:12:44] was it where was it at in
[1:12:47] you you
[1:12:49] know that's just a simple question if
[1:12:53] you say you were born with this seed in
[1:12:54] you where was it
[1:12:57] at was it in your
[1:13:00] body you got a lot of that from Mom and
[1:13:03] Daddy and Uncle a and all these other
[1:13:05] things and genetics and
[1:13:23] your soul
[1:13:27] right see when the prophet is explaining
[1:13:30] that you have a seat in you he's not
[1:13:33] explaining that there is some word
[1:13:36] tattooed inside of your soul Spirit or
[1:13:38] body or somewh
[1:13:40] right he's not trying to
[1:13:43] describe of some something that when
[1:13:47] that baby was born that the Lord was
[1:13:49] right there to
[1:13:50] go you know but he didn't do do it in
[1:13:53] the other now you're getting
[1:13:57] into see you're getting into God
[1:14:02] choosing
[1:14:05] right and we're supposed to believe that
[1:14:07] God didn't choose by his desires cuz he
[1:14:10] desired that everybody be
[1:14:12] saved but now what did the little woman
[1:14:15] at the well have that's
[1:14:17] right gave you a couple of quotes where
[1:14:19] brother R said one of them said she had
[1:14:21] representation of predestination and
[1:14:23] then the other said she had
[1:14:24] representation from predestination
[1:14:27] that's all now he said that that
[1:14:29] religious
[1:14:32] Pharisee he had no representation of
[1:14:35] predestination that's right but yet the
[1:14:38] religious Pharisee knew the Bible of
[1:14:41] what he
[1:14:42] had to the letter that's right
[1:14:47] right so inside of that
[1:14:52] Pharisee
[1:14:54] was the complete Bible as we call it
[1:14:58] right of
[1:15:01] knowledge but yet he had no
[1:15:09] representation all right but the Apostle
[1:15:11] Paul and I gave you that quote where one
[1:15:14] of them had it by head knowledge and
[1:15:15] Paul had it by The Germ of
[1:15:19] life so what was the difference in Paul
[1:15:25] there was a great man that religious
[1:15:27] leader that high priest in the days of
[1:15:30] Paul if you could have touched him in
[1:15:32] any form they would have killed him
[1:15:33] right
[1:15:34] sure true you could bring up anything
[1:15:37] against him it would have killed him but
[1:15:40] here's the Apostle Paul killing the
[1:15:42] Christians causing them to blaspheme he
[1:15:46] said in other words making them deny
[1:15:48] Jesus Christ
[1:15:51] right and yet he had to JM of life
[1:15:53] that's
[1:15:55] right the little woman at the
[1:16:02] whale look at her and look at all the
[1:16:04] people around the great people wonderful
[1:16:07] time you know but yet she had the germ
[1:16:10] of
[1:16:11] life was it a spot down in
[1:16:14] her was The Germ of Life a spot or a
[1:16:19] seed
[1:16:22] right was it somewhere down in your inch
[1:16:25] square compartment a man wants to talk
[1:16:27] about thinking that's where the soul
[1:16:29] abides you know in the heart of a human
[1:16:32] that is in no other
[1:16:34] animal is there a little bitty seed
[1:16:37] somewhere in there that's just floating
[1:16:43] around is it a speck of dust is it a a a
[1:16:49] grain
[1:16:52] right
[1:16:54] or is it the fact that God
[1:17:01] forew which one is it that was the point
[1:17:04] I was trying to get
[1:17:05] across which one is it that's
[1:17:08] right and you say well brother Dale you
[1:17:10] don't believe what the prophet said
[1:17:12] about a seed
[1:17:13] being you're a liar right that's best
[1:17:16] way it say it cuz I believe it well you
[1:17:19] you turn it down you don't no no I'm
[1:17:21] trying to put it together with theti
[1:17:23] Bible in the message of the hour that's
[1:17:25] right I'm trying to get it in the right
[1:17:27] place I believe in that seed but what is
[1:17:30] the seed of
[1:17:33] God I thought the seed of God was the
[1:17:35] word of
[1:17:37] God
[1:17:39] right I thought Jesus the son of man SED
[1:17:43] the seed of the word
[1:17:46] amen and this is a hard one to swallow
[1:17:49] he swed the seed of the word which was
[1:17:52] the law
[1:17:55] right that's what your Prophet said
[1:17:58] right he said he so the
[1:18:02] LA yeah but the law brother was dead law
[1:18:07] spiritual according to Paul
[1:18:11] right but that's what I'm trying to get
[1:18:13] you to
[1:18:15] see what is the seat of
[1:18:20] God it's the word of God
[1:18:25] amen then did you have a word in
[1:18:33] you or you did now here's what I do
[1:18:37] believe that you had a connection to
[1:18:39] that word amen
[1:18:41] amen like I said if I ask you what
[1:18:44] scripture is your favorite
[1:18:46] one W would say Genesis 126 maybe
[1:18:50] brother dick would say another scripture
[1:18:51] over here you know I've heard him talk
[1:18:53] about the the the fact that we've got to
[1:18:56] be pregnated by the word so maybe his
[1:18:58] scripture would be be it unto me
[1:18:59] according to Thy word you know from the
[1:19:02] scriptures but see mine would be Malachi
[1:19:05] 4 because that was the one that held me
[1:19:09] to bring me into this
[1:19:11] message because when I read it the first
[1:19:14] time I said there's going to be two
[1:19:15] prophets come before the end of the
[1:19:16] world I couldn't get it straight but
[1:19:19] that's held on to
[1:19:21] me see
[1:19:23] all right but that's a connection to the
[1:19:25] word
[1:19:28] amen I didn't have tattooed inside of my
[1:19:31] brain somewhere cuz if I did Satan had
[1:19:33] that messed up so you sure don't want to
[1:19:35] die and the best way you'd want to do is
[1:19:36] put it in the in the soul and you
[1:19:39] know and brother random didn't say the
[1:19:42] inch square compartment was the soul no
[1:19:46] you better get your quote
[1:19:47] right he said science says it's possible
[1:19:51] that may be the abod
[1:19:53] of the Soul you better get your quotes
[1:19:56] in the correct order the Abode of the
[1:19:58] soul is a lot of bit different than than
[1:20:00] to say the soul is your you know the in
[1:20:02] square compartment is your soul all
[1:20:05] right now so the
[1:20:07] word is the seat of God Amen the little
[1:20:11] woman at the
[1:20:13] well now boy I got into it one time I
[1:20:17] quoted that to a brother and I thought
[1:20:19] he was going to fight me about it and
[1:20:22] brother Phil temp and I was standing
[1:20:23] there life and
[1:20:25] and this brother I mean I I just all I
[1:20:28] quoted was one thing that brother rown
[1:20:30] said that that the that you know
[1:20:33] that maybe she got it from her mother
[1:20:36] sitting on her
[1:20:38] knee and you know when he was little you
[1:20:42] know like a u Moses you know remember
[1:20:47] sitting on his mama's
[1:20:49] knee and I know the movie and how they
[1:20:52] portray it he didn't didn't know it till
[1:20:53] he about 40 years old you know but that
[1:20:55] ain't exactly right but
[1:20:57] anyhow he uh she told him said you're
[1:21:01] not the son of Pharaoh's
[1:21:03] daughter now I'll take that see I don't
[1:21:05] care what the movies portray or whatever
[1:21:07] else does or how he found it out and
[1:21:09] what took place I'm sure he didn't find
[1:21:11] out a lot of things until wa later on
[1:21:13] but you know in that little Fell's mind
[1:21:15] was always I am not the son of Pharaoh's
[1:21:18] daughter right I'll call her
[1:21:21] mommy
[1:21:23] I I'll do the best and honor her but
[1:21:26] she's not my
[1:21:28] mother cuz I I hear it in my ears
[1:21:31] ringing you know all right so when I
[1:21:34] said that to the brother about you know
[1:21:37] that that maybe the little woman heard
[1:21:39] it from her mother boy he let me have it
[1:21:41] he said I'm tired of this Catholic
[1:21:44] Doctrine know you
[1:21:46] know me pH bold looking at him what the
[1:21:49] world you talking about he said I'm
[1:21:51] tired of this old Catholic Doctrine said
[1:21:54] had to get it from her
[1:21:56] mama you know it didn't don't on me
[1:21:58] until see the Catholic Doctrine about
[1:22:01] mother you know mother mother mother
[1:22:03] mother you know they worship mother
[1:22:05] instead of the son you know I started
[1:22:08] laughing I thought brother phield was
[1:22:09] going to fall over the floor you know
[1:22:11] and cuz the guy was accusing me of being
[1:22:15] I said go talk to brother brandom about
[1:22:18] it he's the one that said them things
[1:22:21] you know but still all right that's his
[1:22:23] business I don't care but
[1:22:28] listen I thought the Bible said Faith
[1:22:31] cometh by
[1:22:32] hearing that's right and hearing by the
[1:22:35] word that's right so I simply asked the
[1:22:39] question is it the word that you
[1:22:42] everybody says you're born with that is
[1:22:45] given the new birth or is it the word
[1:22:47] you hear after you get here that's all
[1:22:49] the simple question I've asked because
[1:22:51] if you say it was what was was in you
[1:22:53] before the world then you don't need the
[1:22:55] new birth you you don't need it like
[1:22:56] people talking about but my point is
[1:22:59] this what is that germ of
[1:23:06] Life all right so that little woman at
[1:23:08] the
[1:23:10] well in her sinful
[1:23:14] condition but yet she recognized
[1:23:17] him cuz when he when he told her her
[1:23:21] problems she didn't say you religious
[1:23:24] Pharisee get out of here you know
[1:23:25] hypocrite no she said you're right I've
[1:23:28] had five husbands and one I'm living
[1:23:30] with not
[1:23:32] mine she knew he was right she said we
[1:23:35] know that the Bible says a prophet will
[1:23:37] come he said I'm he that speaks to thee
[1:23:41] that's right but she never there was
[1:23:42] nothing else ever said now
[1:23:45] listen here's another point we'll cover
[1:23:48] right
[1:23:49] here because people quote brother ramus
[1:23:52] saying see that word she had in her come
[1:23:58] alive all right
[1:24:00] now that's a
[1:24:04] quote now what does he mean when you
[1:24:07] take the law of
[1:24:09] elimination what does brother Brandon
[1:24:11] mean well brother who are you well I'm
[1:24:13] me so who are you but that's all
[1:24:16] right but what does it
[1:24:19] mean when brother brandom would say that
[1:24:22] that little woman at the well said when
[1:24:24] that light struck her said that seed
[1:24:27] came
[1:24:31] alive did she have eternal
[1:24:38] life okay we've took the law of
[1:24:40] elimination and said what there was no
[1:24:43] way she could have eternal
[1:24:45] life that's right because Jesus Christ
[1:24:48] the scripture said had not been
[1:24:49] glorified he had not been crucified
[1:24:51] that's right so how could you have
[1:24:53] eternal life
[1:24:57] right are you listening right
[1:25:00] yes so then you've given the woman
[1:25:02] eternal
[1:25:04] life and every situation in the Bible
[1:25:08] where that things would happen and the
[1:25:10] word would be quickened to people you're
[1:25:13] giving them eternal
[1:25:18] life would that be
[1:25:21] true
[1:25:26] are you giving those people did the
[1:25:28] little woman at the well have eternal
[1:25:29] life because the the seed came alive
[1:25:32] read to Prophet I didn't mean to go this
[1:25:34] way but read The Prophet's message you
[1:25:37] I'll be glad to send you the quotes on
[1:25:39] that he said when that that seed was
[1:25:41] laying
[1:25:43] there he said it was quickened the
[1:25:50] life y so the seed that was laying in
[1:25:54] her was quickened to
[1:25:58] life what was that seed she told you
[1:26:01] what it
[1:26:02] was she said we know that when the
[1:26:06] Messiah
[1:26:09] cometh that had held on to her from
[1:26:12] mother or
[1:26:14] somebody cuz your Prophet said she knew
[1:26:16] the scriptures now you argue with
[1:26:21] him some way she knew that a messiah was
[1:26:24] going to come even though she was not of
[1:26:26] the lineage of the Jews she was a
[1:26:29] Samaritan a half Jew and a half
[1:26:32] Gentile but yet she was looking for the
[1:26:35] Messiah to
[1:26:40] come What Was Made Alive what was
[1:26:42] Quicken to
[1:26:46] her come
[1:26:48] on it was Quicken to her that he was the
[1:26:51] Messiah
[1:26:53] right right he said I he she throw her
[1:26:58] water pot down went into the City and
[1:27:00] brother R said he never done no signs
[1:27:03] nowhere else and that whole city believe
[1:27:06] what she
[1:27:07] said cuz they could see such a drastic
[1:27:10] change in a woman from one day of being
[1:27:12] a prostitute and many husbands and all
[1:27:15] kind of things and all that once well
[1:27:17] almost here preaching the gospel right
[1:27:21] right
[1:27:24] from a personal
[1:27:26] experience that he never had to do
[1:27:28] another
[1:27:29] sign and the people
[1:27:33] believed you haven't never noticed in
[1:27:35] the Bible it says that many people
[1:27:41] believed well did they when they would
[1:27:43] believe did that make them eternal life
[1:27:44] that's a good Baptist
[1:27:49] Doctrine I went have believe
[1:27:55] and come on listen I know how to what
[1:27:57] the prophet's talking about so let's
[1:27:59] keep on going if you want to on that
[1:28:01] your new birth does begin when you
[1:28:03] believe I said begin I didn't say it was
[1:28:07] completed it begins when you believe cuz
[1:28:09] you got to believe that's right you got
[1:28:11] to come to justification you got to
[1:28:13] believe you got to do those things okay
[1:28:14] but now get the point that little woman
[1:28:18] then that seed or whatever you want to
[1:28:21] call it that was laying in
[1:28:24] her whatever way you want to make
[1:28:28] it it came
[1:28:34] alive but that didn't give her eternal
[1:28:36] life that's
[1:28:38] right well bless God I'm going to
[1:28:41] believe it did well all
[1:28:45] right but show it to me in the Bible
[1:28:47] show me how it could be
[1:28:49] done before Jesus Christ died
[1:28:53] now listen this is what my wife said the
[1:28:54] other day and she didn't know I didn't
[1:28:56] know I was coming this way but she said
[1:28:57] you better explain about them Old
[1:28:59] Testament people now they won pass the
[1:29:01] Testament people wouldn't lost right if
[1:29:04] you took that from the last message I
[1:29:05] was trying to preach about
[1:29:07] it those Old Testament people wouldn't
[1:29:09] lost now folks come on that's right they
[1:29:12] were looking unto right that's right and
[1:29:14] when Jesus Christ
[1:29:16] came see they could enter into Paradise
[1:29:21] with him
[1:29:23] right
[1:29:26] right
[1:29:27] because you know he made the
[1:29:31] way now the Old Testament Paradise was
[1:29:34] the bosom of Abraham now it wasn't a big
[1:29:37] fat belly
[1:29:39] right it was Abraham's
[1:29:42] Faith right faith of Abraham in the Seed
[1:29:47] of Abraham provided a place for his
[1:29:50] children to abide right
[1:29:52] you know are his
[1:29:54] people and it's not a
[1:29:59] physical it was a spiritual condition
[1:30:02] that's
[1:30:03] right and you can't see the spiritual
[1:30:08] condition so now get what I'm
[1:30:12] saying the little woman at the well if
[1:30:14] you're going to say she had a seed in
[1:30:16] her brother R said that came alive
[1:30:20] right she did not have the new
[1:30:24] birth that's right she had faith for the
[1:30:30] time you remember that message a year or
[1:30:32] two ago I don't know how long it's been
[1:30:34] I preached on it fa for the
[1:30:38] time you can be healed brother R said
[1:30:42] see that was laying there and them
[1:30:44] people they were
[1:30:46] healed he said she had faith for the
[1:30:49] time in other words you can have it like
[1:30:51] that
[1:30:52] that David went out there and he said
[1:30:56] bar lion giant whatever it
[1:31:00] is you can't kill
[1:31:04] me because the prophet had already
[1:31:08] anointed him to be king and until he
[1:31:11] become king he didn't care for the whole
[1:31:14] world like I said he they said he had
[1:31:17] five Stones they say that Goliath had
[1:31:19] like four or five more Brothers he
[1:31:21] decided okay I better take enough I may
[1:31:23] need
[1:31:24] him cuz he wasn't
[1:31:29] afraid why because it had already been
[1:31:32] quickened to
[1:31:35] him that he was going to be
[1:31:39] king y amen and there's no way to stop
[1:31:42] it but did that give him eternal
[1:31:46] life no all it could give him was
[1:31:50] what Lord Thy word have I hid in my
[1:31:54] heart my soul nothing
[1:31:56] work that I might not sin against
[1:32:03] thee when he died it provided a place
[1:32:06] for him to live in yep until Jesus
[1:32:10] Christ could come forth and resurrect
[1:32:12] that's
[1:32:14] right so then what are you saying that
[1:32:16] germ of life is the forn knowledge of
[1:32:19] God that you would accept the word I
[1:32:23] believe that that's right amen amen he
[1:32:25] didn't have to put it in that's right
[1:32:28] right those are
[1:32:30] statements
[1:32:32] right to get us to think that's right
[1:32:36] exactly amen instead of just throwing it
[1:32:38] out as a blanket for everybody to grab
[1:32:40] and who to hold on to
[1:32:44] no you look down and through time and he
[1:32:47] seen you would want
[1:32:49] it he had it provided for you amen
[1:32:53] Jes now that doesn't do away with his
[1:32:55] predestinated plan that I was trying to
[1:32:57] cover at the end of it cuz that's what I
[1:32:58] want to get
[1:33:01] to you know when your Prophet said it
[1:33:04] was in him to be a
[1:33:07] father it was in him to be a Healer it
[1:33:10] was in him to be a
[1:33:12] savior he never gained him attributes
[1:33:14] when he got
[1:33:15] here so as far as he was
[1:33:18] concerned he had children amen as far as
[1:33:23] he was concerned sickness would come
[1:33:25] into
[1:33:28] existence he had that in him that's
[1:33:31] right like I tried to get you to see on
[1:33:33] the message back there maybe not enough
[1:33:36] time on it but the scripture said we
[1:33:37] read it there in Ephesians that what we
[1:33:40] were predestinated in him chosen in him
[1:33:44] you know if we were chosen in him then
[1:33:46] we had to be in him that's
[1:33:48] right it wasn't him choosing what's out
[1:33:51] there from work that's
[1:33:55] right the chosen was in
[1:33:59] him but just make sure you get what I'm
[1:34:01] talking about because see There's the
[1:34:03] link of what I'm trying to
[1:34:05] say that we look at
[1:34:08] predestination and we just say well if I
[1:34:11] was predestinated I'll be there if I
[1:34:12] want I won't there ain't nothing I can
[1:34:14] do about it now that's a lie of the
[1:34:16] devil that's right
[1:34:19] amen now if you don't want do anything
[1:34:22] about it that's exactly right right amen
[1:34:25] you know if you don't want to do nothing
[1:34:26] about it you're exactly right you lost
[1:34:29] and you're always be lost that's right
[1:34:31] amen that's as sensible as can
[1:34:34] be see we want to look at predestination
[1:34:37] and things and looking at to try to find
[1:34:41] something I've seen them draw out
[1:34:44] dots and preach that God give you a soul
[1:34:49] and Satan give you a soul
[1:34:52] now Satan can't
[1:34:53] create right to law of
[1:34:59] elimination no matter what beautiful
[1:35:02] things would come forth from Li law of
[1:35:05] elimination Satan cannot create amen
[1:35:10] that's right he perverted our
[1:35:12] soul amen he cannot create one
[1:35:18] amen right that's why I believe your
[1:35:20] soul is real
[1:35:22] am that's see they used to say it's just
[1:35:24] the nature of the spirit well brother R
[1:35:26] didn't say that he said it was the
[1:35:27] nature of the spirit that's right you
[1:35:28] didn't say just cuz when you put just on
[1:35:30] her you make it messed up that's
[1:35:32] right what it is but see your soul has
[1:35:35] got to be more real what you are
[1:35:37] amen cuz that's what you really are
[1:35:39] we'll get down to that but all right
[1:35:40] just's come on just for a minute and
[1:35:43] then we'll
[1:35:45] quit see then that little woman she had
[1:35:48] the
[1:35:49] germ of life right that's
[1:35:52] right would you agree
[1:35:57] amen but what was
[1:36:01] it would it not be what the prophet said
[1:36:04] that it was her
[1:36:06] representation by
[1:36:08] predestination or from the
[1:36:12] predestination that he knew she would
[1:36:15] want and recognize him as the
[1:36:19] Messiah and the others would turn
[1:36:22] right see I believe the little woman
[1:36:23] that the well was in the upper room you
[1:36:25] know I ain't got no quotes for that but
[1:36:27] I just do I believe she went I believe I
[1:36:29] believe that's where she got eternal
[1:36:31] life
[1:36:33] see so I believe that's where Mary the
[1:36:36] people want to call her the mother of
[1:36:37] God that's where she got eternal life
[1:36:39] you know what she gave birth to him
[1:36:41] right but to show you how far off it'd
[1:36:43] be then what would she be giving birth
[1:36:45] to cuz when she got over there so far
[1:36:47] you know she begin to say your father
[1:36:49] and I saw you
[1:36:51] see she denied the Virgin
[1:36:54] birth if it was not for the grace of God
[1:36:57] she wouldn't have been in the upper
[1:37:00] room if she had to took the Bible said
[1:37:03] she took the things that pondered in her
[1:37:06] heart amen she was troubled over the
[1:37:10] things that
[1:37:11] happened read your
[1:37:16] Bible but you
[1:37:19] see it was not the birth to the little
[1:37:22] ROM at
[1:37:23] DW for her to recognize the Messiah
[1:37:26] right it was not the new birth to Peter
[1:37:30] when he said Thou Art the Christ the son
[1:37:33] of the Living God and brother R said The
[1:37:36] Father revealed that unto him that's
[1:37:38] right
[1:37:39] sure that didn't give him the new birth
[1:37:42] that's right amen
[1:37:44] true it held on to him long enough till
[1:37:47] he could get to the upper room and sure
[1:37:49] fought like everything to get out of
[1:37:50] there
[1:37:52] you say what do you mean well he denied
[1:37:53] the Lord Jesus
[1:37:56] right I'm sure he sat in the upper room
[1:37:59] saying I'm not worthy I'm not worthy to
[1:38:02] be
[1:38:03] here I have rejected him and denied him
[1:38:07] I need to go out and do like Judas and
[1:38:09] hang myself right
[1:38:12] sir God and he probably would have but
[1:38:15] God had a plan that's right we ain't got
[1:38:18] to them yet but God had a plan cuz
[1:38:20] inside of that man was a gift
[1:38:22] predestinated
[1:38:25] eternally listen like we're talking
[1:38:27] about last night them gifts can be in
[1:38:30] unregenerated people
[1:38:32] exctly but they're still predetermined
[1:38:35] eternally right that don't make the
[1:38:38] person Eternal that's right sure flat
[1:38:40] don't but Peter see had to go to the
[1:38:43] upper room right and receive eternal
[1:38:46] life
[1:38:50] amen
[1:38:52] no matter what his confession was no
[1:38:54] matter what had been made alive to him
[1:38:57] let's see if I can get another one then
[1:38:58] we'll
[1:38:59] quit I'm going by memory this morning so
[1:39:02] forgive you had two on the road to
[1:39:06] AAS have you ever read that real close
[1:39:09] what
[1:39:10] happened there was two on the road to
[1:39:12] emus right and Jesus got in there you
[1:39:15] know and he made out like he was going
[1:39:16] on you know and he wasn't doing it he
[1:39:19] knew he wasn't he he going to eat with
[1:39:20] him but you they said come on eat with
[1:39:22] us come on spend the night with us eat

[1:40:20] cuz what I'm saying is brother Ernie
[1:40:21] could quote that to you real quick he'd

[1:40:25] can it's either 6 or 9 hour sermon they
[1:40:27] heard
[1:40:29] right and when they got through you know
[1:40:32] they said well you you you've talked a
[1:40:34] lot about these things and we believe
[1:40:36] them but said you don't seem to realize
[1:40:38] that Jesus died
[1:40:42] yeah he said you don't seem to realize
[1:40:44] that he had to
[1:40:46] Die the Bible said he opened their
[1:40:49] understanding of the scriptures did that
[1:40:52] give them eternal
[1:40:55] life he goes over and appears to the
[1:41:01] disciples when the two the two got back
[1:41:05] you know and you know it says again he
[1:41:07] opened their understanding of the
[1:41:10] scriptures what
[1:41:12] about about him and what he come to
[1:41:16] do and they're still over there just a
[1:41:18] few days later saying you going to
[1:41:20] restore the kingom right exactly see it
[1:41:22] wasn't a new birth
[1:41:25] right but you see that's what people
[1:41:27] wants to say these people we've born of
[1:41:29] this seat and when the light flash it
[1:41:30] just flash and I come alive you know
[1:41:33] like the the uh who was it come on just
[1:41:35] hitting me um the was it da the man that
[1:41:39] was in like his 90s when he was
[1:41:40] converted somewhere in one of the
[1:41:42] brother he said that light flashed
[1:41:43] across sir he said when it did he struck
[1:41:46] the water amen that didn't give him
[1:41:48] eternal life he probably already had it
[1:41:53] right see you're people are thinking and
[1:41:56] you're thinking in your mind that there
[1:41:58] was a seed laying down in there and then
[1:42:00] that seed Was Made Alive well I'm trying
[1:42:02] to show you that that seed can be made
[1:42:04] alive on many occasions but that's not
[1:42:07] from New Birth
[1:42:09] right you must be born again
[1:42:14] Amen to have eternal life
[1:42:18] amen the gift of God is eternal life
[1:42:22] right through the Bible says Jesus
[1:42:25] Christ that's right see then what is
[1:42:32] it the word can be made alive in
[1:42:38] you I was
[1:42:40] called a 2-year
[1:42:46] Theologian and I told you my
[1:42:49] experience I didn't CL a going to come
[1:42:51] in this message that gave me eternal
[1:42:53] life to just come into the message
[1:42:56] right when I came into this message I
[1:42:59] saw I didn't have eternal life but
[1:43:01] everybody else said you come into the
[1:43:02] message prove you had it I bet people to
[1:43:04] tell me that you come into the message
[1:43:06] didn't
[1:43:07] you so yeah but I didn't have eternal
[1:43:09] life
[1:43:11] right and I saw eternal life for two
[1:43:14] years and it in those times that I would
[1:43:17] read six books a day and listen to two
[1:43:19] tapes
[1:43:25] I just rejected my wife my family and T
[1:43:27] and it just saw I done was read and read
[1:43:30] and read and
[1:43:32] studyed cuz I knew how far we' missed it
[1:43:36] right and the way we was
[1:43:40] going I was seeking
[1:43:43] God and one day then it was all
[1:43:45] quickened and Made
[1:43:47] Alive two years and I sought the baptism
[1:43:49] with the Holy Ghost
[1:43:51] well you're just that it's just your
[1:43:53] stubborn all
[1:43:55] right all right but you don't got it
[1:43:59] right and you know what never denied the
[1:44:02] word you know all that knowledge I had
[1:44:05] he never denied a bit of
[1:44:07] it when he come in to indwell me you
[1:44:10] know he started making that alive to me
[1:44:12] amen that's right like way said when he
[1:44:14] come back to the Lord you know he said
[1:44:17] Daddy watch this I said just he said how
[1:44:19] come I know all that
[1:44:21] right I said because you read it when
[1:44:23] you were 10 years
[1:44:25] old when he 10 years old he read the
[1:44:28] message like
[1:44:29] everything it was laying there but that
[1:44:32] didn't give him eternal life that's
[1:44:34] right
[1:44:36] see the little woman at the well she had
[1:44:38] representation from
[1:44:41] predestination God looked down and Shout
[1:44:43] she'd want it and it there it was that's
[1:44:45] the seed that's in you not something put
[1:44:48] down in you like a spot and you know
[1:44:50] well there it is I found the spot you
[1:44:52] know x-ray the other day looked down
[1:44:54] into my heart and found a little bitty
[1:44:57] spot the other probably
[1:44:59] cancer now you don't like that right cuz
[1:45:01] you think I'm joking I'm
[1:45:05] not you better go have the thing
[1:45:09] checked because the seed of God cannot
[1:45:11] be seen
[1:45:13] no the seed of God is more invisible
[1:45:16] than the germ of natural life if the
[1:45:19] germ of natural life how canot be found
[1:45:21] by mankind how can you find the word of
[1:45:23] God outside of God bringing it to you
[1:45:26] that's right and I
[1:45:28] believe that there was something
[1:45:30] different about you yes sir I do I
[1:45:33] believe that if you go back in your life
[1:45:35] and check it you'll find out there was
[1:45:36] something about you different all of
[1:45:38] your life yes
[1:45:40] sir I've told you about it that I'd go
[1:45:43] out in the world of sin and do wrong and
[1:45:45] then come home and and feel
[1:45:47] dirty why because I remembered when I
[1:45:50] had met met God back there not as a new
[1:45:52] birth but I knew there was an eternal
[1:45:55] God before I ever come into this
[1:45:58] message cuz I had met
[1:46:01] him I seen him I
[1:46:05] know but that didn't give me eternal
[1:46:13] life how much word was quickened to me
[1:46:16] in all of those years that I could stand
[1:46:19] on when the two old man told me he said
[1:46:22] come on up and has long later come on up
[1:46:24] and preach for me and I just a young
[1:46:26] convert and I said I can't see what
[1:46:29] you're talking about
[1:46:31] sir I said brother maybe it's me you
[1:46:34] just pray for me I just can't see
[1:46:36] it he said well come on up and be with
[1:46:39] me and I no fight out with him I just
[1:46:42] told him I couldn't see
[1:46:45] it you know if I can't say something I
[1:46:48] can't say it that's right I just tell
[1:46:51] you I can't see it I ain't saying I
[1:46:53] ain't going to see it
[1:46:55] later when I said I can't see it that
[1:46:57] means I just don't understand
[1:46:59] it you see but God's for knowledge he
[1:47:02] looked down through and what is the germ
[1:47:03] of life God's for knowledge to see that
[1:47:06] you would want that right and he'd have
[1:47:09] it for you
[1:47:11] right why can't you look down and see I
[1:47:13] accepted
[1:47:15] it and then you can realize then if you
[1:47:18] accept it like I did for 2 years I
[1:47:21] accepted it let alone all those years
[1:47:23] before then but I accepted it you know
[1:47:25] but what one day he accepted
[1:47:28] me am a lot of difference amen that's
[1:47:31] right you can go a long time seeking
[1:47:35] after God sometimes I know what
[1:47:37] everybody other people teach you you
[1:47:38] don't have to search you don't have to
[1:47:40] seek God you don't have to do this that
[1:47:41] and the other you just got to believe it
[1:47:44] you got to out somewhere to get to a
[1:47:45] place where you can believe it believe
[1:47:48] what I a even got on the message today
[1:47:50] cuz the very first thing is that I've
[1:47:51] got in here is that we must make sure
[1:47:53] there's one thing for certain that what
[1:47:56] that the word is planted perfect and
[1:47:57] pure and unadulterated because only the
[1:48:00] word can be
[1:48:01] birthed that's where the trouble's at
[1:48:03] people trying to birth
[1:48:05] denominationalism and ideas and Mankind
[1:48:08] doctrines amen right yes sir instead of
[1:48:11] taking God's word amen and believe in it
[1:48:15] what did the prophet say he said false
[1:48:17] prophets produce false birth right true
[1:48:20] prophets produce true brother oh brother
[1:48:22] I'm trying to make them a prophet see
[1:48:25] that's all the mind can go
[1:48:27] on told you I'm no
[1:48:29] Prophet I'm a born again Son of God but
[1:48:32] I am not a prophet of God in this
[1:48:34] message we talked about that last night
[1:48:36] in the Bible study I do not have the
[1:48:38] characteristics of a
[1:48:41] prophet so I do not say I'm a
[1:48:44] prophet cuz I know what I'm
[1:48:46] not so don't you get in your idea that I
[1:48:49] am you said but the word comes the word
[1:48:50] comes to the spirit field the word
[1:48:51] supposed to come to the entire five-fold
[1:48:54] Ministry you mean you tell about
[1:48:56] evangelist yeah the word supposed to
[1:48:57] come to him to go out and
[1:49:01] evangelize where the trouble is it don't
[1:49:03] come to him he goes out and evangelize
[1:49:06] him the teachers go out they don't come
[1:49:08] to them they go out to teach what their
[1:49:10] own Doctrine right and it produces what
[1:49:12] church is
[1:49:14] full but false
[1:49:17] bir that's right
[1:49:21] go talk to him about the word and see if
[1:49:22] where're it's right or not that's amen
[1:49:25] if I deny the word then that's one thing
[1:49:27] for sure I've got I don't have the New
[1:49:28] Birth come on musicians come
[1:49:32] on I just want to make sure you
[1:49:34] understood what I was saying those Old
[1:49:36] Testament
[1:49:38] Saints they had a confession of their
[1:49:42] belief in
[1:49:43] God and that's what was holding them and
[1:49:46] provided a place for them to live in
[1:49:49] when they would pass own right yep amen
[1:49:53] and we'll get to it later where you talk
[1:49:54] about it like this you know what they
[1:49:57] had a
[1:49:58] soul it was not into full maturity of
[1:50:01] the theophany back there for them but it
[1:50:03] did give them a place to go a
[1:50:06] theophany because of theh is eternal
[1:50:09] life amen but you
[1:50:11] see what do you think about
[1:50:15] it if God is calling you then why not F
[1:50:18] follow him
[1:50:21] yeah but look what I have to give up you
[1:50:22] don't have to give up nothing to follow
[1:50:24] God that's where you're wrong you think
[1:50:27] you got to give up something to follow
[1:50:28] God you don't have to give up the thing
[1:50:29] to follow God you just follow God and
[1:50:32] watch everything take care of
[1:50:33] it that's why I Don't Preach like other
[1:50:36] preachers you got to do this you got to
[1:50:37] do that you got to do that you got to
[1:50:38] wear this why because you get born again
[1:50:40] it'll take care of
[1:50:42] it that's right it'll take care of what
[1:50:45] you're wearing and what you doing the
[1:50:47] new birth that's
[1:50:49] right and let God live in you that's
[1:50:52] where our trouble is we haven't let God
[1:50:53] live to sit the where the people can see
[1:50:55] God living we tried to like brother R
[1:50:58] said we we Let's see we don't get them
