Open the Eyes of My Heart I want to see you I want to see you Open the Eyes of My Heart Lord Open the Eyes of My Heart I want to see you amen do you want to see you highly shining in a lot of your glory pour out your power in love amen ing in the light of your glory pour out your power and love is that your desire for him to pour out his love foreign amen and amen amen I want to see him don't you you know and I believe every day we're getting closer to that point or we'll be able to see him in good to see everybody in the house of the Lord if you like turning your scriptures turn where we've been reading in Romans 8 and we'll go to Genesis 4. Romans 8 Genesis 4. we just received a notice from Brother Bob that they did do the the drainage from the fluid in the lungs of sister Monica's mother and it did positive test positive for cancer so used to be much in prayer we know that what did it matter if it was a a bad cold or whatever it is it's all in God she's been I think one time when she was delivered before or something there I remember something down through time and all and he can do it again so just but that's the that's the report out of right now so just remember that by the way of announcement remember brother Claude why singer will be with us the Lord will end this weekend preaching for us remember the fellowship meeting will be the third Saturday which will be down at brother Tony's there at Six Flags if you want to go make sure you let us know and everything and then brother Forney will be with us I think it's the last Sunday of this month which is the 24th I believe that's right you're supposed to be in the part of that week so remember that and just pray that the Lord would bless each one all right Romans 8. and Genesis 4. Heavenly Father we thank you for your grace and your love unto us and thank you for all things and we know you give them to us freely so then we don't have to work for them we don't have to pay for them we don't have to do nothing for him we just have to believe so Just Have Your Way forgive our sins and lead us by thy Grace and understanding father and we pray that you'd be there with sister Monica's mother Lord and just deliver her because we believe you we believe that by your stripes he's healed just as much as it would be if they told us he had a bad cold Lord or any kind of infection there's no difference because we believe you we just ask you to be with us tonight Lord and touch his old body in this cold and everything Satan's trying to give us and we try to give it back to him and we just but we just Praise Your Great Name for your loving grace unto each one of us have your way in our hearts and lives forgive our sins and lead us in Jesus name amen you know this is I mean Romans 8. I may have to be huffing and puffing but if I put in a cough drop tonight it won't be because that I'm chugged up and so uh bad cold is trying to get on us and it just starts running and been life and sitting down on the deer stand you know and trying to hunt yesterday afternoon and this morning and sitting there coughing and a wheezing and a grunting and doing everything else I finally just put my face mask this stuff under my nose and you know kind of bad way of doing it but because I couldn't just keep wiping and doing it I just put it under there and just went over and just let it drop and then it made no difference you know do everything you can to try to hunt and don't see nothing anyway but maybe you don't see nothing cause you're blowing your nose so much I guess but just uh just keep us in your prayers it'll be all right all right Romans 8 28 and we know that all things work together for good to them that love God to them who are thee called according to his purpose for whom he did for no he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many brethren moreover I want to get to that one these days that he's the firstborn among many Brethren more over whom he did predestinate than he also called and whom he called them he also justified in whom he justified them he also already passed Tennessee glorified what shall we then say to these things if God be for us who can be against us it's a great thing right all right go to Genesis 4. and we'll read a little bit 4-1 and Adam knew his wife and she conceived and bear Cain and said I've gotten a man from the Lord and again and she again bear his brother Abel and Abel was a keeper of the sheep but Cain was a tiller of the ground and in the process of time it came to pass that Cain brought to the fruit of the ground and offering unto the Lord enabled he also brought her the firstlings of his flock off the fat thereof and the Lord had to respect unto Abel and to his offering but unto Cain in his offering he had not respect and Cain was very wrath and his countenance fell and the Lord said unto Cain why aren't thy Roth and why is thy canonists Fallen if I do as well shall thou not be accepted and if thou doest not well sin life at the door and unto thee shall be his desire and thou shalt rule over him see we can rule over sin if if we were desire correct and Cain taught with Abel his brother and it came to pass when they were in the field at Cain rose up against Abel his brother and slew him and the Lord said unto Cain where is thy brother and he said I know not am I My Brother's Keeper and he said what has thou done the voice of thy brother's blood clieth unto me from the ground and thou art thou curse from the Earth which hath opened her mouth to receive thy brother's blood from thy hand when thou tillest the ground now remember Adam had already been placed on for him but here it really gets bad for this he would not tell us the ground that shall not henceforth yield any yield unto thee her strength a fugitive and a vagabond shall thou be in the Earth and Cain said unto the Lord my punishment is greater than I can bear Behold thy has driven me out this day from from the face of the Earth and from thy faith shall I be hid that shall be a fugitive in a vagabond in the earth and it shall come to pass that everyone that findeth me shall slay me and the Lord said unto him therefore whosoever slayeth came Vengeance shall be taken upon Him Sevenfold and the Lord set a mark upon Cain lest any finding him should kill him you may be seated the Lord had his Blessing to the reading of the word now I want to go back over a lot of things that we covered there Sunday but you know not to try to do too much but try to uh because what I want to tie together is of what we've been talking about first you have unbelief all right see then unbelief has a display or we call it an attribute like drinking gambling smoke is not sin it's an attribute see it's a display and in doing that if you'll notice each one of these things in Cain what I want you to think about is first Cain gets upset because of his offering well evidently he was in unbelief about his offering all right he gets upset and he's goes before God and his brother random said where was ever a time when anybody ever you know just literally lambasted God or this you know rebuke right at him you know I don't know am I My Brother's Keeper and uh then see there was a display of Cain's unbelief and that wound up being killing his brother so there's always a display of anything so we say the original sin was unbelief and that's true all right but it had a display or an attribute in the act with Eve between Eve and the Beast and to mess up the whole human race see it's always an attribute follows unbelief all right now the point I want you to get this afternoon if we can is we know the Bible doesn't say about Cain or saying leave it take it or leave it brother random is the one who emphasizes that's what he's saying all right now once you say take it or leave it once you bring it out as I was trying to say there Sunday you know when you say take it or leave it all right then there's going to be a display of that there's going to be an attribute of that there's going to be something brought out that will uh you know go into greater things and then from that that you see then that in itself once it comes into being then it will become greater or get worse and worse and worse and worse as it goes along now had Cain done what God told him to do we've done proved it by Brother Branham and we don't worry about it then but we've already covered it that God offered Cain you know he would have been all right if he'd done it and you you got to remember brother Donnie and I talking a lot about this yesterday and today but remember to illustrate it like in the children of Israel it says that Israel sin ten times from the time they left Egypt until they got to Katie sparnia all right that literally says they send sin ten times now sure there was a lot of people got killed 30 000 like at some at one time or something you know all right but still they were on the way to the promised land right all right then when it did the the unbelief that had been in the people manifested itself in a greater way when it come to kadish barnia and when it did it really showed that unbelief as a great thing because like I've tried to show you then God would forgive him for doing this he'd forgive them for doing that he'd forgive them and doing this ten times he said go on you're going to the promised land but when it come to the point that they disbelieve God about the bases that they were capable of going into the land you remember the ten spies well like God said all right that's all the unbelief I'm gonna put up with it's got worse and worse and worse and worse now you've come to the worst of all that you're doubting me that I'm capable of doing it's okay you're heading to the Wilderness you know in a display all right see that's what I look at in the garden as it starts off with one thing you know then it went to another thing and another thing see and Eve you can see that it was her unbelief all right then it went from her unbelief to a physical act the of adultery and uh then we see that same thing start in Cain and Cain's unbelief evidently must have been believing Mama's lie uh you know because looked like that surely him being the firstborn that uh you know look like Adam and Eve would have taught their kids what went on but they evidently didn't I'm just that's just a point and as it wound up so Cain winds up in saying all right I've done what I've done I not going to do anything else that you can take it or leave it all right now we know God left it so now watch what I'm getting at we're going to go if we have time from take it or leave it to the mark of the beast going to run around and said that was the first time in the garden the mark of the beast was placed upon mankind it's placed on Cain brother Carly and I were in a meeting up in South Carolina when a couple of the big name preachers with our conducting of questions and answer con you know thing and somebody asked him said what was the mark that was put on Cain well they knew better than to go into Blackness Etc so they said well we don't know when we was coming back down the road and I said well brother Carly you know something we were talking about it I said you know they didn't know and I said I really don't know what was the mark that was put on Cain he said I do I said you do he said yeah I just heard brother Branham say it was the mark of the beast I said well okay maybe we need to turn around and go back and let you answer some questions you know but the point is watching something it'll go from one thing and it'll go to another all right had came have done what Abel done God would have accepted it all right now I believe that and he still didn't stop dealing with him we gave you a quote in that maybe re-quote it after a while but everyone said God went after him he still wouldn't even after all that that happened and even after he killed his brother you notice the Lord's still talking to Cain he said no that couldn't be forgiven it's all right do what you want to I'm just stating what the scripture says God was still talking to Cain all right but when Cain is we'll get to it now I know brother random I've looked it up I know his way he's saying it and he's saying that God drove Cain out I agree with that but the Bible says it Cain went out from the presence of the Lord he doesn't say God run him off right now he was put out because sure you couldn't leave sin in that presence but just remember that after all was said and done God was still dealing with Cain all right but then when it finished up the Cain went out of the presence of the Lord you never find again in the Bible I'd like to see it you don't find God dealing with Cain anymore see he'd sealed his Doom all right so then let's be careful that we don't do that all right you say well brother Dale I don't think we will well I'm just honest to ask you a serious question how many of you thought about the point of Cain's saying take it or leave it until we read what the prophet had to say about it right and found out it to be very serious and very related to the very hour that you and I are living but we can look back dark and talk about that but what has that got to do with me and you all right now that's the point I was driving at because I had it on my notes and we only got just a little bit Sunday is to saying take it or leave it the next step is the mark of the beast now to read what a prophet has to say should be enough for you and I to check our own selves that's what brother Dale I don't have the mark of the beast I don't I've never told God take it or leave it well there's no place in the Bible that Cain says God take it or leave it no that was the point I was trying to get at the Bible says that we go in the way of Cain what was the way of Cain very religious going to church worshiping God believing God we read what the prophet said about it could we be in that class because remember you and I either have the mark of the beast or the Seal of God and we're not talking about children in underage and different I know get it out of your mind forget all that we're talking about people that we either have the mark of the beast or we have the Seal of God and I'd like for you to think about that a little bit why would it say mark of the beast with seal of God now remember as we'll get to it and we'll back up when I make this statement the mark of the beast is in your forehead is that right the Seal of God is in your forehead no brother Dale seal of God's in my heart we'll get to that I know where it's at I know it's in your heart but what does the Bible talk about the Seal of God being in your forehead it does but I want you to think about it and just stay with me from leave it there we'll go to the mark of the beast if we don't do something about it and I thought well surely Lord I don't need to get away from this I don't mind reading the same thing over again for us to look at it we went through about Cain being of the wicked one and the wicked one being the children of the you know you got the seed of God coming through the children of God in the parable and then you've got the wicked one being the children of the devil all right but then why would Jude as I was trying to express our Sunday first is Jude 1 11. why would it put in the way of Cain right in the line with the era of Balaam put a wave Cain right into Arab Balaam and knowing that Balaam was the one who got God to curse Israel it's close folks he said but I would have the baptism of the Holy Ghost you can have the baptism of the Holy Ghost on your spirit every day of your life and don't go to hell do you have the Seal of God yeah but the baptism of the Holy Ghost right it is the Seal of God there's a lot goes with it they get a chance for don't I'll take it up next service and never think it didn't bother me to just because I want to just keep laying it before you to give you a chance to think it over because the way of Cain was not to start with a murderous mean character that was the display finally of his unbelief he went to church he served God and remember now that when you come over to this that they've done been put out of the garden the third chapter and Cain is right there before the cherubims are turning to guard the way of the Tree of Life Cain and Abel both offer their offering at the gate that goes in that's what your Prophet said all right we're to know that by reading all right but now let's just be careful that we don't let this form of Cain being us of leave it there because the next is the mark of the beast all right so the prophet said you already have the mark of the beast are you how the Seal of God all right so that means every person in the world no matter whether they're knowing about salvations Etc whatever you know christianities they're sealed by the Away by the mark of the beast right now brother random I read it to our Sunday but did you pay close attention he said 99 out of a hundred goes like Kane and there's not a hundred in here but we'll say there's 50 in here so that would only leave a half of a high for sure right you get me if there was a hundred in here it'd mean one had the Seal of God the rest had to mark of the beast star and I don't think that way but I'm just I don't think he was thinking that away but he's the one that gave the example all right so then if we're going to believe what he says we ought to believe it but I want to reread all of these you know I want us to make sure that we're not in the way of Cain um because remember now Jude puts the way of Cain right in with the error of Balaam and what's the other one and gain saying okorah and Cora was the one you know that says we're we're all spiritual I got it right think what I won't think cause I'm spiritual too putting it all together but think about it could we be that away and if we are that away would we be in this day especially would be would we be of a murderous character you know because you've done transformed over into the Christian Realm and and that wouldn't be allowed so you wouldn't be dealing with murderers and killings and things but it would come down to just simple little things in our lives then what about it but brother Dale you you know that's why we don't you know you don't give us hopes there is no hope outside of Jesus Christ I'm telling brother Donnie today I said well there's one thing that I feel about I said my I'm not guilty the blood of no man I can honestly say that because I believe I've tried to do what was right you know all right and I'm free of that because I've tried to tell you the truth all right but let's just read these things and think about what your Prophet is saying of the way of Cain and see if we're in that way just remember now there's none of these quotes that we give goes back to a murderous character you know it all goes to a very religious oh things that he's talking about going to church being good serving God believing God think about it go ahead brother and let's start on number one which is Abraham's Covenant confirmed uh 61 318. so many people today God you'll give your intellects to God he will do that I'll build you a big house I'll make you an organization I'll do this I'll do that don't you realize that's the same thing Cain did it was rejected he said all right Cain built himself an altar and made a sacrifice and said here it is I worship you I believe you there's My Sacrifice he worships like brother Donnie brought up a good point he said you think Cain went away and went off and quit making offerings I said no I don't think he did I think he went away from the garden and probably went right on making offerings but I don't believe he made him in blood do you right no so what did he say Cain built himself an altar and made a sacrifice and said here it is I worship you I believe you there's My Sacrifice there's my altar take it or leave it well look as I said you don't find that in the scriptures but a prophet gives us the understanding of what the scriptures are saying right thing so he gives you the understanding of what Cain was doing see Kane didn't just jump up and run out of the garden when these things started happening it went on for a while until it come into murder we'll get to that if we have time he said that's the man today the religious man Esau the same way and the church the same way I've done this I've done this I've done this it ain't what you've done is what he done give him your heart and follow him next one e-18 mark of the beast 1961-17. and we noticed that Cain he made an altar he put sacrifice on it he got down and confessed his faith in God and he worshiped God see we think about him as just a murderer that was a manifestation of his unbelief you know all right he worshiped God in other words just like the religious man today 99 out of a hundred almost they say and there's his quotes he here it is so 99 out of 100 says here it is it's the best that I can do Cain said this is I I built an altar I belong here to church I made a sacrifice this is the best I can do take it or leave it there it is that's just that's the attitude of people today I go to church I help them do everything we build a nice building built a nice building we've done all this and we've done all that in everything and I put into the winners fund and I do all this there it is the best that I can do take it or leave it but God will leave it right what about all of the good works that people today are doing and yet it's a take it or leave it affair because they're not going to change their attitude right come on he left it there for Cain he will leave it there for you there is a way that seemeth right unto a man but the end thereof is the way of death there's only one provided way for God that's down the bloodstream to the Holy Spirit without that you're done you're finished you'll never go in all right go ahead to the next all the days of our life 1959-8 uh sixth whale look at them here kind of fade out okay and he's so much like Kane Cain wanted to be religious so he went and made his own religion and when he did he brought it before God was something like this here's the best I got this is all I can do about it not take it or leave it now without being derogatory to anyone or thoughts or religions or ideas think about the religious world of today and I say the message people you and I so I'm not derogatory to this church over here okay what they are between them and God but you think about it why is it that people will not receive what you have to say about the word when they're a whole lot better than we are right good people religious people worshiping people but present the word to him and see what to do with it right yeah but y'all are just old word people I'm glad you said that we was life another day kind of funny brother Collins was talking about he had a preacher down that preached for him there and said the old preacher got up and told me going to preach on a new thing and uh he got up there and he said now these old barns out here he said you see them old barns he said they need a new coat of paint and he said that's like these women you know we're putting on makeup on your face I started laughing I looked over Donnie and I said I don't want nobody calling my wife a no Barn do you realize that statement people would make the preacher made the statement that the old barn needed a new plane I'd have got up there and said you apologized my wife she ain't no Barn but you say we don't do it so you do the best you can he says here it is best I got this is all I can do about it now take it or leave it what is the church world today saying to God the greatest religious Society of the world ever been probably today and what do they say unto God are they saying we want your word no they want a spirit among them a move that's about the way man does today I helped build a church I sent my children to church there I put the money in it every year and that's the best I can do take it or leave it oh see he wants his own way that's the way Cain did that's what people are saying right look God still loved him and he still went after him right what did God tell Kane you'll do well if you'll do if you'll just worship like your brother Abel and Abel come God's way but Cain wanted his way and God said now Cain I've got nothing against you if you'll just come over and go the way that Abel goes you'll do well the people of the message preach see the Cain can't be saved you've never heard that priest you wasn't listening too much potential lineage it's impossible to be saved and according to the prophet but you know what they'll say I've studied the message and I got this out of the message you take it or leave it right okay look the next one hearing acting and on the word of God 1960. 221 but look the church natural is just the church carnal they'll never they're never able to get above that little thing of they see they can't get above that that's the church or you understand what he's saying they can't get above what the church thing is of their churchy thing or the thing to serve God now that's what he's saying they're never able to get above that little thing of I joined church I go to church if I do the best that I can that's all God requires see they can't get above that come about you and I brother told me one time he said I know I'm going to heaven because I pray for the prophet's kids I said well praise God pray for mine too I see you you put it on and people have put it on run around and saw me there so I know I'm going well remember he went to hell and he saw people there of course you know your brother Dale that's just sarcastic he wasn't talking about me then okay you make your choice look thinking well that's all God requires you ever talk to people and say we don't need to know about this water baptism you know why y'all build on stuff like that close higher you know why why do you you say this wrong for a woman to cut her hair and for her not wear makeup or her not to wear pants and things that's just all words God don't look at that he's looking at the heart remember out of the heart proceedeth the whole thing out of the heart comes the pants on the woman I hope some of our new coming visitors are listening do not try not to be too sarcastic and beat people over the head could I remember where I come from and where you come from but the truth is the truth you know oh God requires me to do I go to church I worship I play my tithe I love the Lord now he's putting it in the ways of Cain now that's the same thing Cain doing he went and made an alder he made a sacrifice brought the fruits of the land and he said here it is God that's the best I got take it or leave it that's the way the carnal believer believes today foreign Lord I go to church I'll join the best group that I can find I'll pay in my dues to the church I'll do what's right now here's the best I can do I'll help buy some coal for the winter I'll give the children some clothing it was all right nothing to say against it but that's it that's all if you want it take it if you don't you don't have to take it now that's people saying that to God right people are saying to God if you want it take it if you don't you don't have to take it now that's the attitude of the church carnal today but do we fit in there well brother then what do you want we come to church we you know we do everything we what do you want I want us born again right are you saying we ain't born again no that's left up to you that's not left up to me and I'm glad of it I ain't never told nobody that's born again because I can't you can deceive me I just tell you what a Christian will do and I'll tell you what a sinner will do then we'd have to find our own way all right look at the next one an uncertain sound 1961 315. e37 if an order of Cain came to cry of a land able excuse me came a crime in the Land There was death to pay the penalty blood was being shed and today God just like it was in that day when he told Cain was discouraged he said here's the best I can do you can take it or leave it do anything you want to about it but that's all I can do about it that's the way the modern church worshipers today I go to church what about it where do we fit he said but brother Dale you said while ago that everybody in the world was either marked with the mark of the beast or the Seal of God all right and remember now the prophet said and we'll read it he said you're already marked he said the punishment comes later do you realize if you're not born again what are you the domain of Satan right so then everybody now There's No Gray areas you said but this person over here is is coming through justification and sanctification that's good but they're not in the Kingdom they're not in the Kingdom till they get the baptism when the Holy Ghost all right what about you look at the next one this is the true Easter seal 61 um 402 uh paragraph 159. and they refused his messiahship when they showed them when he showed them he was the Messiah they were forced to say something now watch this and so are they today turning it down and won't sponsor him and washing their hands from it the decision is forced upon them there's no Middle Road we're at the end time man's forced to receive it or reject it right one or the other no middle grade you've got to accept it or turn it away it's forced upon America watch it's forced on the Branham Tabernacle we got to make a choice random Tabernacle let's make a choice is forced on the Pentecostals on the Methodist it's forced on Forest everywhere you have to take it or leave it then there's a few of those taken or leave it is not talking just about Cain so if you look them up you'll find some good things God has confirmed his word showing his signs back in his ministry showing exactly what he is by proving that he's God all right now what are we going to do now let's make a showdown no random Tabernacle got to make a decision Lula Georgia's got to make a decision all right no middle grounds make a decision now we're going to put this take it or leave it in the mark of the beast together all right so we want to read what he says go ahead with number seven East 70 the mark of the beast and the Seal of God number 2 61 2 17. after it's brought right up to you and showed you that is the Seal of God just because of prestige I was listening we was the other day where we had mentioned about that remember the Holy Ghost tried to come on who was he uh Saint Augustine a hippo we was listening where brother Branham you know and I told you I didn't know what went on but there was something there that he turned that down or something because the Holy Ghost couldn't come on him and we just hit the tape last night and I was running around him explaining it that that's what happened at Saint Augustine of Hippo knew what he'd lose the Holy Ghost tried to come on him because now he says that Martin and hippos together that's that's what brother run says so you know all right I'll get you to tell you if you want just because of prestige you have to give up something or you quit your denomination or something to receive it and then walk away from it you know what you do you seal yourself out of the Kingdom mark of the beast now people will say because of a quote brother around a mate run around and said it's God's obligated to put a man on the pulpit to answer your question I've had people to tell me God's obligated to come to my church and put it on the platform in my church for me to hear it I wish stood at the end and I still do today I'll say nope that ain't right because the prophet said too that if your pastor Don't Preach the truth you get away from your pastor all right sure God's obligated to bring you the truth but he's not obligated to bring it to your church that's something added to the quote all right but now listen you seal yourself out of the Kingdom mark of the beast when God told Abel or told Cain said just go over and worship like your brother bring a lamb come down here and worship like your brother said you will do it right you'll do all right do as your brother does you'd be all right but he wouldn't do it said this is the best that I can offer and you can take it or leave it and he was marked and went out of the presence of God when he was saying you take it or leave it we read in the scripture you read on down a little bit and then he was marked right take it or leave it you go out look what this one says the mark of the beast the Seal of God number two 61-17 East e 73. but if you hear the trumpet see hearing Faith cometh by what hearing now not not just listening listen with your ear but if you hear that means you understand it you accept it I hear it I believe it see it's hearing Stephen said you stiff-necked uncircumcised and hard and ears the uncircumcised they could hear it with their ears but uncircumcised they couldn't believe it uncircumcised in the heart and ears me understand it oh it's all a mystery to me like Cain take it or leave it I joined church that's as good as I can do all right Kane you'll Mark with the Beast and go right on off in your denomination which you can come to Christ and be sealed of the Holy Ghost you can take your choice and watch you hear the gospel trumpet what is a gospel Trump the good news the Holy Ghost is here how do you know it is it watch it works see what it does it's the good news oh yeah look at the next one or let's get on to this let's get on to this and then I know we won't have time tonight to cover it we don't want to get up to a point look I don't want to Anchor something in you where you'll think about it McCain said unto the Lord Genesis 4 13. My Punishment is greater than I can bear them behold thou has driven me out this day from the face of the Earth and from thy face shall I be hid now shall be a fugitive and a vagabond in the earth and it shall come to Pious that everyone that findeth me shall slay me now watch that's where I want you to deal on this scripture a long time we'll get to it later what is the mark of the beast it's in your forehead right 666 the vicarious Philly Idis and the thing the trinitarian doctrine in your forehead is the mark of the beast it wasn't something stamped on Cain there is no 666 stamped on your forehead right it's a trinitarian Doctrine if we got the trinitarian doctrine we got the mark of the beast now I know you don't like for me to say these things but it doesn't matter whether you're in a denomination and have a trinitarian Doctrine or where you're sitting in Lula Church our pastor and Lula church if we got a denominational Doctrine is contrary to one true and living God then we're trinitarians and we're already marked with the mark of the beast punishment will come later we can prove those points right but look and the Lord said unto him now remember the Lord still dealing with him big old capital little Rd therefore whosoever slave Cain Vision shall be taken on him 7-4 and the Lord set a mark upon Cain lest any finding him should kill him no God put a mark on Cain we'll prove that if we don't get through tonight that's the mark of the beast that's what your Prophet said he said first time it was done it was done in the garden but I want you to think about that scripture because I know years ago it come upon my talks about that scripture a lot and I wrote it in my Bible like this you ever thought about God protecting Cain McCain said anybody finds me going to kill me we want to run it to the mark of the beast then we want to run it through ideas we're thinking that it's blackness you've heard that right the Blackness was put on Cain Blackness was put on ham well wouldn't it be kind of a problem we need to think about that if Blackness was the thing that was put on Cain what about us it's about half black come on are we Hive cars we'll prove by the prophet gonna know we won't deny it but the prophet said Blackness is not a curse he said if it is the Jews would be half cursed they'll say half black he said the curse is to reject God so there wasn't a physical Mark placed on Cain he wasn't standing here one color another color or he was standing here brown-headed and a great big glowing light was placed up over his head and God said no everybody leave a lot alone now what happened there Kane said they'll kill me and you know that Adam should have killed Cain Rider now wait a minute now you know what well you don't either so forget it just talking I mean if if one of your boys killed the other one you ought to at least have some punishment right I mean you know come on one of your kids kill the other one brother right what are you gonna do okay I got another one just go kill that too right come on what did God do there I'm asking the question you got an answer what'd he do well he put the mark on him well what was the mark what was it what color was it what distinction I'm just asking a simple question Terence you got two boys one of them killed the other one you're gonna go Pat him on the backs he's doing a good job boy no you say you're silly don't I'm getting a point across it'll ring the bell when you see it God took the hate possibility away from Adam or away from Seth that came on later got to remember Cain was still alive when Seth become a grown man saith would have been saying Cain killed my brother what I need to do what do you think took place I'm up for questions come on I just wrote it in my Bible a long time ago I said look what God can do he can cover a lot of things Cain said they'll kill me God said anybody that killed you he said it'll be Sevenfold against him he took the hate away just as he did from Esau when Jacob was returning and thought everything was he was going to get killed at least and we was the other day to attack and brought around and said see there he said God took that out of Esau to take care of his brother God took the hate out of Esau's mind when he gets there Esau looks at him and says brother I just don't waste you no more let's just put everything down forget it he's look I'm rich I don't need nothing you remember Esau sin all of us Jacob sent all this stuff ahead to give to him brother Ron said he took the hatred out of he saw his heart man what do you think was given well it was a market to me well what color is it what Mark is it what is the mark of the beast it's in your forehead in it doesn't say on read your Bible we'll get to the scriptures it's in your forehead it's in your intelligence when God put the mark of the beast on Cain he looked no different one second that he did the next second but I'm just trying to get a point to you God didn't set a mark of the beast to protect him because that would have been God making him go into unbelief I hope that rings you can't make God guilty of causing unbelief to come upon Cain getting in the wrong category but God protected Cain he took out of the hearts of those that was against him and they didn't want to kill him then the mark of the beast appears pull up back up now brother and we'll read it then the mark of the beast appeared lord said unto him therefore whosoever sleth came Vengeance shall be taken on him 7-4 and the Lord set a mark upon Cain lest any finding him should kill him it looks like he's putting the mark of the beast on him to keep him from being killed so what is the mark of the beast it's in his forehead where would that be protecting him where would it be protecting Cain would Cain to have the mark of the beast in his forehead what protection would God be placing there in the mark of the beast is what Cain had all right I'll go any further I'll have to get into some things here but let me just scan this see we think Blackness is a curse if you'll read go into questions and answers book two par uh paragraph 153 through about one 65. you'll hear Brother Branham explaining that Blackness is not a curse you hear him explaining that you think that ham was cursed skin through and read it ham was cursed was ham turned black we want to try to put some kind of something like we'll get down to it eventually brother random says people think that Cain went over in the Land of Nod and married an ape a monkey and said that's where the black people come from you've heard him say it right and he says that ain't right you can't mix a monkey and a man if you could wind up with some form of the Beast left you'd have a possibility the word he can't get his wife he took his own sister right right where else did he get it I'll prove it to you and run around and said there wasn't no other race for it to come from he took his sister because girls were not put into lineages remember Cain and Abel were both 20 years old or something but think about it and then I want to say one thing what's the difference in the seal of God in the mark of the beast why is it they're both in your forehead let's read what the prophet says the difference is look at number 12 brother and we'll go back over these next Wednesday or whenever I get around to preaching on brother Cloud to be here this weekend look what he says now mark of the beast and seal of God it's not the Seal of the Beast and the mark of God a mark is a distinction it makes a difference it separates something like you say you've got one Mark against you Lamar but you never said you had one seal against you come on you got one Mark against you in a seal is a sign of ownership a mark is a distinction and the church is sealed by the Holy Spirit showing ownership God owns a church but the mark of the beast is the Wayward the outcast that refused to take and come God's provided way Cain as soon as he was marked was sent away we got that Abel died and Seth raised up to take his place was a sign of the Resurrection or do you understand it doesn't say the mark of God says the Seal of God with the mark of the beast the Mark is a distinction you know a separation the church is sealed by the Holy Spirit but what about when we get over the scripture or not back up on this next service mark them that sigh and cry for the Abominations done in the city you can use Mark and sealed together in God's way of doing things what about over in Revelations about the Seal of God in their forehead I know you're quiet of course you generally always real quiet anyway but that's no problem you just gotta real because you're wondering what in the world am I talking about you're trying to figure it out so just trying to figure it out I'll just tell you what I'm talking about I'm talking about what I've tried to explain to you for 40 something years that God has to use the same channel to get to you that the devil uses which is through your head down through your spirit right and anointed ones now I'm asking you a question those anointed ones have the mark of God or the Seal of God now come on as anointed ones right if they're sealed you got a problem but get the point down through the same channel that God uses to speak to you and I the devil uses the same channel to try to get to us all right but brother Dale I thought the Seal of God was in your soul I do and I believe it is you're sealed in Satan sealed out but just remember through the brain and through the memory reason conscious effects Satan can still get to you sure I heard a man years ago that we really need our blind baptized with the Holy Ghost and I said amen now let me preach a little Doctrine point for a minute what is the new birth is worth of the word why is it that some people can be anointed say the uh what was his name well I don't know Pope wound up Saint augustino hippo he rejected the Holy Spirit right the prophet said it in did that mean he wasn't religious um and you know that in his forehead was truth trying to develop why is it that it's so hard to understand anointed ones and how you can be Anointed with the Holy Spirit because you're not anointed in your soul you're anointing on your spirit right your spirit is memory reason conscious affections Etc anointing then what is the new birth is the birth of the word remember the Bible said that some took the word in The Parables and they held it and the prophet said the Holy Ghost came and quickened that word now it's the same thing Brother Gary I've always tried to preach we talk about them people being anointed ones if you have the new birth today you're an anointed one oh boy because every person that ever gets born again the Holy Ghost has got to come down through your brain through your memory your reason your conscience why does it say and some took the word and held it cares of Life Etc took the others away right did he take them away to the world of sin no no they become religious and they become anointed ones see when the Holy Ghost is coming down on you watch it about the the Pope why did it not come on that man he didn't want to give up what he had right he had a pope he didn't want to give up what he had receive the Holy Ghost but the Holy Ghost came down on his Spirit to anoint him had to get close for him to turn it down see I believe the new birth is the birth of the word amen and that's why there was 120 in the upper room not 500 that was seen after Jesus's resurrection right the Bible said he was seen of over 500 brethren they didn't come up to get the Holy Ghost on the day of Pentecost might have got it later ain't got no problems with that but they wasn't there on a death Pentecost why why would that Pope what was wrong there because he had something in his soul it wasn't right you see it's supposed to be that sanctification that unclean spirit is supposed to be driven out of your soul right where the Holy Ghost can come in but what if it's not driven out Holy Ghost can't come in but he can come down as far as your spirit and anoint you come on what is the new bird is this the birth of the word all right if it's a verse of the word the Holy Spirit comes down upon the word you have held there's your new birth but to others that just take part of the word and because of prestige because of jobs because of their churches it comes down and tries to come on them and he can't come on them because they got it closed out but yet they can shout Glory Hallelujah just as good as anybody else and they wind up being anointed ones sister gay and what is that you've heard it's birth of the word you took in your heart and waited for the Holy Spirit to make it alive but what if in your heart you doubt it God can't make it alive so all of that I read and all of that when we're you know God is a good God God knows I want him come on you mean that Pope said I don't want God no ain't no man in the world to say that one God new verse the birth of the word some took the word in hell and the Holy Spirit could Quicken it some took the word and let others interpret it now you see one that I've always said brother random in his early Ministry used to let others preach am I right and then he would come out and pray for the sick right why did he stop that I wouldn't want to pray for people to receive the Holy Ghost when the preachers up preaching a trinity would you I'd say hold it Brothers get on the truth and plant a seed in the heart of the people and then the Holy Ghost can fall and Quicken the word what's the difference an anointed one you and I are anointed ones come on you don't want to be an anointed one no but I just don't want to be a an anointed one is just an anointed one I don't either but it's all determined on whether or not we can hold the word and cherish that word and receive that word that's what determines whether or not the Holy Spirit can give birth to that word he can't give birth to a false seed right that's why you don't have as a prophet said too many or how did he say it you don't have very many new births right why but are you going to be like the man told me he said I took my wife to a Pentecostal Church to get her free in the spirit and then he knows he call he he knew he'd done goofed up and he started back peddling you know he didn't want to finish his sentence I said now brother you just tell me that you think of Pentecostal you can get the Holy Ghost to come on your wife better than somebody preaching the truth that's why there's very few new births people don't preach the truth they preach come up here Shout Scream holler Shakey do whatever I'm nothing against it I don't have anything against it I've seen them in Jamaica I'm not a Pentecostal come through a lot but I did see them there take the little kid's mouth come on come on sweet come on what trying to get them speak in tongues you can speak in tongues every day your life and I go hey all right you can be anointed on your spirit everyday life go to hell but my point is don't ever think that you're not an anointed one anointed one means Christ it's Christ's own those people right around said to genuine the Holy Ghost but why they're not born again you that been to these count meetings and I'm not against them especially the youth they get a lot of commitments in these youth meetings right but the next time they have one they got the same people in the altar with another commitment why don't you get somebody in there to preach you don't have to preach see those plagues Thunders fight preach the new birth justification sanctification and the baptism of the Holy Ghost why don't you give somebody to preach like that you might see kids getting born again instead of that you got the kids in order the next year seeking God right around and said you make come on twofold Child of hell than you did to start with see it is the mark of the beast but it's the Seal of God now wake up a second and listen I thought we believed in being born again I thought we believed that getting the new birth was just the beginning am I right I thought we believed in the statue of a perfect man is to add to your faith virtue or knowledge Temperance praise God I thought we believed that a birth was a coming forth into I'll back up on this next time because I know it's going to be hard to put it right here I told brother Donnie today I said I'd give anything for a way to explain what I see why does it say the Seal of God is in your forehead your Prophet said it does the Bible says and it's the Seal of God in there forehead why do you understand what's going to bring a Rapture Brother Gary we've talked about just a little bit Ryan what's going to bring a rapture when God can seal that forehead with the seal he's got sealed in your heart can I do it come on folks we are being born again we're being sealed in our forehead I'm still in my heart you ain't listening you get to steal in your heart that's a new birth you get to seal of God in your forehead by the message or the hour that is revealed to you and I that will bring us up the statue of a perfect man being born again okay that's what the Bible's right when it's you got the Seal of God in your forehead in your intelligence is the only way that God can contact you and that's the way you get a revelation is through your intelligence through your spirit into your soul the prophet said the Holy Ghost is sitting in your soul waiting on you to bring him the word now that's what your Prophet said you want that quote waiting on you to bring in the word he said then he can make it alive why because Faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word what's going to change these beings that we are when God can drive out all of our intelligence that is contrary to his word right and that's got to be from the inside outwardly and then he can seal that forehead so brother there you sound like you believe in two or three seals I believe in being born again I believe in a growth development in the word of the hour you see church that's why I've preached so hard trying my best to get you and I you and I to a place that God can speak through these brains that we've got and it not be a cut off Channel down into the soul until we can stand right there and look right at it and say that's it come on folks you ever been healed you ever been instantly healed have you ever received a revelation come on you ever received a revelation what happens the god in here is waiting on you to bring him the word and when you bring him the word he makes it alive we're being sealed in our foreheads let's stand being sealed in our foreheads but let's just don't let this take it or leave it thing go out as to be the mark of the beast because it'll cause death one brings life the other brain's death right what about it I don't understand you brother Dale I don't either I don't understand me either but I know I have one desire and I got to preach to your head but now you know yourself what I'm fixing to say that I've said many times I don't just speak to heads heads I don't do no good I try to speak to your heart if you just open up enough is that on souls in prison he said if he can get that soul to stand still long enough he's explaining the new birth he said if he can get that soul to stand still longer he said that soul will die the nature of that being will go out and God can come in you see what I've preached on the new birth I've been waiting on somebody somewhere to help me preach the new birth like I said the other day I would leave right today if I knew they were places in Africa that people were preaching according to what I understand a little bit about I would just leave and go fly there then I'd go to anywhere else I could go because I believe God is revealing his word it's not just in Lula never taught nothing like that I'd love to go and just listen I don't want to go preach I won't go listen I want to hear somebody talk about God that I've the God that I see I want to hear somebody talk about the New Birth then I see that Jesus said they cut the word and held it and the Holy Ghost came and quickened it but the others didn't hold it they didn't count it honorable so thereby when the Holy Ghost fell it couldn't fall on them you see one there's not very few new births and not a lot of new births go ahead brother what we got 103. you have longed but you can't not have rest until all until that forehead is clean concealed by the Holy Spirit anybody have a need and how peace few days got to go for blood work tomorrow he's also having a hurting in the back of his head so let's just believe let's believe God will touch that hurt in his head but let's believe that that blood work will be all right all right father my brother said he's hurting in the back of his head we lay our hands our condemning that hurt we believe you we believe it because of what Lord we preached about you we want the birth of the word we want that word revealed our brother that says by your stripes he's healed and Lord let work will be all right I believe you we thank you we love you Lord we just commit it to you in Jesus is coming let's see let's see if God is real pain and
