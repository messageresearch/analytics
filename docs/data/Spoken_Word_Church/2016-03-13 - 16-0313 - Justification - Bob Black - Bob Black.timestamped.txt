[0:03] now I want to talk this morning about a
[0:06] real simple loop to the subject but if
[0:09] maybe a lot of times we kind of
[0:10] overlooked and that is the subject of
[0:12] justification because when we're talking
[0:15] about the new birth and everything a lot
[0:16] of times in our mind maybe we'll kind of
[0:18] skip over and and and we want to get to
[0:21] the new verse as fast as possible almost
[0:23] like it maybe just kind of thinking in
[0:25] our head you know and we want to almost
[0:28] kind of treat justification as you what
[0:30] yeah you believe in you turn around and
[0:31] those kind of things and just keep on
[0:33] moving but I think you know the gospel
[0:37] is so simple that these little simple
[0:39] things and we've been talking about
[0:41] patterns and things and how God God in
[0:43] his simplicity just gives us a real
[0:45] pattern because it's so hard when are
[0:46] our human minds to really grasp anything
[0:48] that's complicated so he gives us
[0:51] something for us to understand remember
[0:53] program before it Cecilia said remember
[0:55] just keep only the same symbol true I
[0:58] forget exactly how the cocoa but the
[1:01] same simple message same simple messages
[1:04] continuum because it's real simple and
[1:07] this same simple just looking at
[1:09] justification the same simple truth of
[1:12] justification keeps keeps going up
[1:14] higher and higher and higher and NC what
[1:17] really what really a justification
[1:18] really is you know kind of kind of think
[1:22] before we get into this why did brother
[1:24] branham when he began to preach the
[1:26] capstone messages i went up to nineteen
[1:29] sixty-five an invisible union widen he
[1:31] stressed so much that we are justified
[1:34] it is the similar is more powerful and
[1:37] it became so much more deeper to him as
[1:40] the message went up higher and higher to
[1:42] higher plane a higher plane of
[1:43] revelation i claim is life than it was
[1:46] when you look at it as just a stepping
[1:50] stone a piece of the
[1:52] the things that God does you to bring
[1:54] you to a new birth because think what
[1:57] what is really JIT to be just before God
[2:00] where you could stand before God and he
[2:03] looks upon you and says there's I
[2:05] finally little fault in him I find no
[2:09] fault lay my bride right out of here we
[2:12] just ran John chapter 31 where and
[2:18] gentlemen zone he's trying to say well I
[2:21] had one break this long list this long
[2:23] chapter of all the good things that jump
[2:26] is doing and really if you stand before
[2:29] I only God those things like my brother
[2:31] Joel brought out his message that I
[2:33] righteousness before god it's like
[2:35] filthy rags all those things that job is
[2:39] gonna head looks real good let's go
[2:42] ahead come on man that looks real good
[2:46] on that book but when God looks at you
[2:51] if he's not looking at a reflection of
[2:54] himself God willing inside a person then
[2:58] your righteousness it's just like it's
[3:00] just filthy rags right back so here's
[3:02] here's a if we read down through joke
[3:06] moving over from Joe chapter 31 to job
[3:08] chapter 32 these first two verses where
[3:11] Li who comes on the scene who was the
[3:14] type of Christ and give his job a little
[3:17] bit of Correction so these three men c
[3:19] stands for Joe because he was righteous
[3:21] in his own eyes they ceased to talk to
[3:24] them comfortable you know if if you
[3:26] believe that your own works are enough
[3:29] to save you that you in your own self
[3:31] that's enough reason it's almost like
[3:34] what more can you say to somebody they
[3:37] just left off talking to it and here
[3:39] comes alive then was kindled the wrath
[3:41] of the light of the Sun Chronicle
[3:43] who's I of the candidate of RAM against
[3:45] Joe was his wrath Kendall because he
[3:49] justified himself rather than God now
[3:53] there's the whole the whole secret of
[3:55] the Christian experience is to get
[3:57] yourself out of way God can't justify
[4:00] myself the only justifier the only way
[4:03] that will ever be able to stand just
[4:05] before God at this is if God comes down
[4:07] and does something does something for
[4:10] you to make yourself manifest in you now
[4:14] let me let me switch over the slides
[4:17] that I have here and starting off with
[4:22] it easy of course we know all the Old
[4:25] Testament story was of bringing your
[4:28] lamb and and placing your hand on and
[4:30] being identified with it in faith not
[4:33] just because somebody told you do it but
[4:35] because we have a real revelation of
[4:37] what's going on looking to it to the
[4:39] sacrifice looking to the offering that
[4:41] was made for you and it's the same way
[4:43] we do today when if you go to church and
[4:45] don't have an understanding of what
[4:46] Christ really did for you they need to
[4:49] pull himself all other things that you
[4:52] did and would do in your life and if you
[4:55] if you put your faith in Jesus Christ
[4:57] not by anything that you have done it
[4:59] ain't nothing that you can do to warn
[5:02] any kind of salvation nothing that you
[5:04] can do it's only in Jesus Christ yes if
[5:08] you get this this whole type of it runs
[5:11] through the entire Scripture but I want
[5:13] to stress this from the old testament to
[5:16] the new and that's what a lot of us get
[5:18] in her head that in the old testament
[5:19] christ jesus that the attributes of god
[5:23] were different in the new testament no
[5:25] he's the same yesterday today and
[5:27] forever if you can't even buy coming in
[5:29] by faith today that's how they came to
[5:32] him in the old testament in fact that's
[5:34] the scripture I'll back it will talk
[5:36] about it and then just shall live by
[5:38] faith that's an old testament scripture
[5:41] that the judge shall live by faith not
[5:43] by works but my face and Leviticus 17 11
[5:47] assists crib
[5:48] talks about that prohibition of eating
[5:50] blood and things because for the life of
[5:52] the flesh is in the blood and I have
[5:53] given it to you upon the altar to make
[5:55] an atonement for your souls for it is
[5:57] the blood that maketh an atonement for
[5:59] the Soul something had to give a life
[6:04] now in brother branham except we're
[6:07] going to look at a justification kind of
[6:09] going going down through the plan of
[6:12] redemption because it starts off
[6:15] justification before you get the new
[6:16] birth it starts off as chopping off your
[6:19] past sins you've done a lot of wrong and
[6:22] you believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and
[6:24] all the things that you have ever done
[6:26] and this is what's so fantastic because
[6:28] they don't matter what it was you're an
[6:31] adultery how about this a pedophile I
[6:34] bring it all down bring it on down to
[6:37] the most horrible thing you can think of
[6:38] now really think about how horrible
[6:41] things that people do but if you have
[6:44] faith and believe on the Lord Jesus
[6:45] Christ he'll wipe the slate clean yes
[6:48] right the future home of the heavenly
[6:51] bridegroom they're only bride now the
[6:53] first step is repentance toward God and
[6:55] it follows after that is water baptism
[6:57] water after to a pen and be baptized the
[6:59] name of Jesus Christ sea water baptism
[7:01] falls showing that repentance was
[7:04] genuine order to remit our past sins to
[7:10] take away the things that you did in the
[7:13] past that has nothing to do with future
[7:17] sin now say we're getting somewhere now
[7:21] first take it away your past sins
[7:24] because we're moving on the look to
[7:27] being where what God looks at us and we
[7:29] remember the statute perfect man
[7:31] adoption all these things are talking
[7:34] about oneness with God we're trying to
[7:36] move to oneness moving from
[7:38] we're far apart is a great chasm between
[7:40] us and God and moving this up until
[7:43] we're until the bride is speaking what
[7:48] God that got the revelation the voice is
[7:50] in the bride and cool that I know that
[7:53] stones a lot of people like hold on now
[7:55] how can you how can you say that the
[7:57] voice will be in the bride well how can
[7:59] you say that God will come down and
[8:01] Tabernacle himself inside of a believers
[8:03] of the only ghost that that's stumbling
[8:06] to that God can make himself manifesting
[8:08] somebody and show for this work through
[8:11] through the Baptist but all yours has
[8:12] been down through the seventh Church 85
[8:17] showing that repentance with genuine or
[8:20] to remit our past sins that has nothing
[8:22] to do with future sin it only remits
[8:25] repent and be baptized in the name of
[8:27] Jesus Christ work for remission taking
[8:31] away of past sin has nothing to do with
[8:34] the future just your sin has been
[8:37] chopped off what you did you can't
[8:40] repent from what I've done you never
[8:42] know that Adam do you just forgive your
[8:43] forgiveness for what you're doing the
[8:45] old nature is still there that's that's
[8:49] the key what I'm trying to the point I'm
[8:50] trying to make their old nature is still
[8:52] there you got your old seasons chopped
[8:54] off all nature is still there we're
[8:57] going to wear that old nature stealing
[9:00] their we're going to us that's what I'm
[9:02] going this morning is where you can
[9:05] stand before God perfectly justified
[9:08] where he looks upon you it says an
[9:11] invisible Union and brought across
[9:12] better in priest now the bride is
[9:15] justified you are justified we're god
[9:18] you're looking for you as a no fault
[9:20] anywhere now this is I found this this
[9:25] is a little letter we all know the story
[9:27] Baberaham Lincoln porn and this is one
[9:29] of the partners that he signed this man
[9:31] is pardoned and hereby ordered to be
[9:34] discharged from the service he wrote it
[9:37] and this is how he had party he dried up
[9:39] scribbled down real quick and I think
[9:41] this is actually written on the day that
[9:43] he died and we know the story of how the
[9:46] power
[9:47] must be received as a partner's got to
[9:49] be accepted as gotta be it's gotta be
[9:51] you gotta believe that is for you and
[9:53] the gospel tells the gospel is so
[9:56] fantastic in the end of proclamation
[9:59] that it makes there anything and depart
[10:01] if you'll just believe it and that's
[10:03] what we have so much trouble just
[10:05] accepting what's written and God word
[10:07] that no matter what I've done and no
[10:09] matter what you doing that it can be
[10:12] pardoned and and and and you can be made
[10:15] completely just before God Michael 718
[10:22] it was a god-like under the pardon of
[10:24] iniquity and passes by the transgression
[10:28] of the remnant of his heritage he
[10:31] retained it not his anger forever
[10:32] because he delighteth in mercy this is
[10:36] the Old Testament scripture remember
[10:39] remember the story about David God gave
[10:41] him a choice he turned over to the hand
[10:43] of the Lord when he when he did wrong i
[10:45] think it was be numbered the children of
[10:46] israel he will be turned over the head
[10:47] of the Lord you want to be turned over
[10:49] to the head of the the of the kings of
[10:52] the world will not explain I'm doing
[10:54] them for things and uh I'm kind of
[10:56] paraphrasing quickly but David said I'd
[10:58] really be turned over into the head of
[11:00] the Lord because I know that God is
[11:02] reaching mercy of God slew some of the
[11:05] children of Israel because of what they
[11:06] didn't done but he still knew David had
[11:09] a revelation that God was rich in mercy
[11:14] that's what that part of the snickering
[11:16] who was it God like underneath he
[11:19] retained if not his anger forever
[11:20] because he delighteth in mercy he will
[11:22] turn again he will have compassion upon
[11:24] us he will subdue our iniquities and now
[11:27] will cast all their sins into the depths
[11:30] of the sea which is a poetic way of
[11:33] saying then there ain't on me no more
[11:35] they're going to be completely
[11:37] annihilated the sins are going to be
[11:39] going of course now we will remember
[11:41] we'll bring them up and we'll bring them
[11:43] up things that other people do does and
[11:46] stuff like that but but as far as God is
[11:48] concerned they are gone their knowledge
[11:51] man I was kind of looking at the deepest
[11:54] place in the ocean is 10,000 almost
[11:58] 11,000 meters deep which is which is way
[12:00] higher than Mount Everest is so now if
[12:02] you were to top something down to the
[12:04] bottom of that if you talk something
[12:06] down into a deep pool it's going to be
[12:08] kind of hard to retrieve it if you talk
[12:10] something down into the deepest part of
[12:11] the ocean you ain't never getting it
[12:15] back is that yo that's right didn't so
[12:25] the annihilation of past sins and
[12:27] ignoble Graham talking about Clorox to
[12:29] outlaw roxas you put he puts us a
[12:32] sustained in the Clorox bleach no God's
[12:34] blood and it wipes it out and the Clorox
[12:37] you know gets all in the chemical
[12:40] structure in the molecule that
[12:42] everything until this is for literally
[12:43] gone the stain is gone and he says
[12:47] that's what the blood of Jesus Christ
[12:49] does to the true child of God when he
[12:51] confesses that sin and says they're
[12:53] justified in his mercy goodness even
[12:56] it's so great to God said I can't even
[12:58] remember it anymore and it's absolutely
[13:00] my son stain remover for whites I put
[13:08] because it the bleach of God blue will
[13:12] it will make us in spotless the spotless
[13:15] my church adem can be presented to him
[13:18] holy and blameless right through and
[13:21] through so gentle 92 the job answered
[13:24] and said I know it is so of a truth but
[13:26] how should maybe just with God in june
[13:29] nine twenty twenty two deities on if I
[13:31] justify my mouth shall condemn me if I
[13:34] say i am perfect it she'll also prove me
[13:37] for earth though I were perfect yet
[13:39] would I not know my soul I would despise
[13:42] my life because why would he say
[13:45] something like that well if you could
[13:46] lay out all the good things in your life
[13:49] doing still there's something wrong on
[13:51] the inside of man something's got to
[13:54] happen on the inside of man now that's
[13:56] the best of thing about before the new
[13:59] birth if you're justifying all your sins
[14:01] are chopped away there's still something
[14:03] wrong you got to have something change
[14:05] on the inside of a man so that you could
[14:07] stand before God because if the nature's
[14:10] not changed you can have those past sins
[14:12] chopped off but you'll just keep going
[14:15] right back there's still a conscious of
[14:17] scenes right there's still something in
[14:19] there that that that makes you draw
[14:21] toward the things of the world and
[14:23] that's got to be gotten rid of Luke 16
[14:30] 14 and 15 and the Pharisees also who
[14:32] recovers heard all these things and they
[14:34] derided and he said on the knee are they
[14:36] which justify yourselves before me but
[14:38] God knoweth your heart see I maybe
[14:43] you've heard the expression before that
[14:44] then we judge one another by by our
[14:47] works or by the things that we do but we
[14:50] judge ourselves by our our 10 and
[14:54] everything in this I can you know God
[14:55] judges the same way as we judge
[14:57] ourselves which is merciful he looks
[15:00] upon our motives in our objectives my
[15:02] works are presented other people but God
[15:04] knows the secret of our heart we can own
[15:06] outside we can present ourselves as Holy
[15:09] and pie someone conspiracies but on the
[15:12] inside you can be like a open
[15:14] likewise if occur as Jesus says oh I'll
[15:17] canker everything on the inside but
[15:20] that's why I says but God knoweth your
[15:22] heart you got to have that inside change
[15:25] so justification is well and good and
[15:28] it's needful on the path to being own
[15:30] again but we're talking about something
[15:32] on a change on the inside moving up
[15:34] higher and higher and let me kind of
[15:38] kind of keep going on so I don't and
[15:41] this is the script track quoted earlier
[15:42] back at two for behold his soul which is
[15:45] lifted up is not a pride in him your
[15:48] soul lift it up but how could you
[15:51] remember real revelation will bring your
[15:53] soul down because you realize how much
[15:55] you need God that's one of the greatest
[15:58] things that God can show you that
[16:00] nothing in myself that I can ever
[16:02] justify myself with ain't nothing in
[16:04] myself that I that's even worthy of
[16:05] boasting or anything all the glory needs
[16:08] to go god yes because if we believe on
[16:11] him the just shall live by faith the
[16:14] just little by his face Jove 19 23 23 to
[16:22] 27 old and my words were not already
[16:24] know that they were printed in a book
[16:25] that they were craving with an iron pan
[16:27] and lid and the rock forever forever for
[16:30] I know that my Redeemer liveth see how
[16:33] is it he's living by faith that he shall
[16:37] stand at the latter day upon the earth
[16:38] and though after my skin worms destroy
[16:41] this body yet in my flesh shall I see
[16:44] God whom I shall see for myself and mine
[16:47] eyes shall behold and not another though
[16:49] my reins be consumed within me I'm just
[16:54] kind of moving quickly
[16:56] I am the resurrection in life program
[16:58] said the job here four thousand years
[17:01] before his coming saw his death burrow
[17:04] and his a resurrection and his
[17:07] justification that come by the
[17:10] resurrection and the absolute guarantee
[17:13] of the resurrection of the believer what
[17:16] a comfort it is to know that those
[17:18] things are true it's not a fiction story
[17:24] now I just put this put this in it cuz
[17:28] up cuz with them keep going up high for
[17:30] a second here justification is all of it
[17:33] all these three things are done by the
[17:35] word are you hit a word of them that the
[17:37] Spirit comes and you yield yourself to
[17:39] the spirit believe the Lord Jesus Christ
[17:40] a quick as it to you your aquarium that
[17:43] you believe the Lord and you're
[17:44] justified you believe the Lord and and
[17:46] it works I surprise you you believe the
[17:48] Lord and finally a baby is born out
[17:50] there you say one that's what we're the
[17:54] key point right there is is when the
[17:56] baby is born then your borning you
[17:58] you're justified your sins you're cut
[18:00] off and you keep movin on up eating the
[18:02] word clip being cleaners is easy to
[18:04] thirty-six twenty-six twenty-seven cents
[18:06] and a new spirit while I put in you I'll
[18:08] put my spirit in you a spirit of god
[18:11] that puts it is in you that push
[18:13] you into service and then would you move
[18:17] over them that's right knee high on a
[18:19] higher because God has a he's got like
[18:22] an evolutionary path where even in the
[18:24] beginning when he he created the animals
[18:27] and everything and he began to move up
[18:29] and created the monkeys and they created
[18:32] beast who I
[18:36] hey that might be it kind of close he
[18:39] was upright like a man talking and those
[18:42] kind of things but but then God made
[18:45] Adam and Eve and and put a soul in them
[18:48] said they were walking a higher form
[18:51] that's that's what the same thing that
[18:53] God does in the script trees he starts
[18:55] you off to the foundation starts you all
[18:57] the new birth and it keeps moving you up
[18:58] higher and higher everything is
[19:00] continually moving up higher and that's
[19:02] what I reading this program said in the
[19:05] statute perfect man he was talking about
[19:06] you you fall have the altar in you have
[19:08] an experience with God and you think
[19:10] that's it but no God is moving a higher
[19:12] and higher he's continually moving up
[19:14] and what's he doing as he moves up
[19:16] higher higher z's uniting himself you
[19:18] with himself and so so let's just come
[19:23] stay on this for a few minutes I'm i
[19:26] hate that clock y'all the viable proof
[19:30] of the reservation program says but
[19:32] let's watch him as he stands there
[19:33] gravitation and this is where this is
[19:35] the scripture in the Bible he's talking
[19:37] about work in Acts chapter one ways he's
[19:40] given his final message to the believers
[19:42] and then he ends up in a cloud and he's
[19:45] given his message that this is the same
[19:47] thing that the believers were doing
[19:48] ascending up higher and higher on the
[19:50] word but let's watch him as he stays me
[19:52] gravitation loses his power one day
[19:55] gravitation is going to lose his power
[19:57] for us to right now watch his feet begin
[20:00] to come up from the earth there's a
[20:02] light beneath his feet he rises higher
[20:06] and higher higher and higher
[20:11] gravitationally lost his power just as
[20:14] death lost his power he was the center
[20:17] of gravitation he was the creator of
[20:19] gravitation he held gravitation and his
[20:22] own command as he held death and his own
[20:25] domain okay that's what you see you get
[20:30] born again and you think well I
[20:31] understand justification and
[20:33] justification was just something
[20:35] something to get me to the point where
[20:38] I'm born again but it's high you got to
[20:40] keep moving up higher and higher
[20:42] moving up to higher planes higher and
[20:45] higher like it is when a man will stay
[20:48] not come up and shake hands with the
[20:50] past you put his name on the book but
[20:51] when he will stay there until he feels
[20:53] something cut loose inside of him and he
[20:56] begins to float out younger by faith
[20:58] knowing that his sins opacities anchored
[21:00] his soul in Christ and there is
[21:03] something raising him higher and higher
[21:05] persistent perseverance now that's after
[21:09] he gets the new birth hey
[21:10] something-something raising him higher
[21:13] and higher right hey I love this quote
[21:16] brother I was talking about if you you
[21:18] know he's talking about i quickly
[21:20] paraphrase you get all these little
[21:22] denominational thing almost these little
[21:24] ideas and things in our mind and
[21:25] everything that's separates us from one
[21:27] another and he's talking about if it
[21:29] will just get lifted up higher and
[21:30] higher like like ducks on different
[21:33] sides of the fence that the rain comes
[21:36] and lifts us higher and higher too it's
[21:38] just all united not united by like some
[21:41] kind of denominational system but you're
[21:43] not invited a word and reminds me of a
[21:46] fellow one time had some ducks and he
[21:47] cut their wings and he could fly up and
[21:49] yes and took some one side and ducks on
[21:51] the other water began to come in the
[21:53] first thing you know the water got
[21:54] higher and higher ducks got together
[21:55] then and I'm skip down so denominational
[21:58] barriers can be floated out if we just
[22:00] let the waters get deep enough and we'll
[22:02] let the waters get deeper out of a spoon
[22:06] because that's what we're uniting me
[22:09] with God and we as we take more of the
[22:12] word and we grow in grace and knowledge
[22:19] oh okay now so we talked we've been
[22:24] talking about justification as as
[22:26] putting away your past sins and and of
[22:30] course you still got that same nature
[22:32] you got to have that nature change so
[22:35] justification is talking about put that
[22:38] a death to the to that sinful nature of
[22:40] death to the sins not just not just
[22:43] cutting them off and leaving them
[22:44] hanging somewhere but a real
[22:46] justification is the total annihilation
[22:48] of those past sins we're talking about a
[22:51] total annihilation of that old nature
[22:54] until you can stand before God's
[22:56] completely just and moving on all the
[22:59] way up into a capstone we're now you
[23:01] really justified and such were some of
[23:05] you but you're watched as Paul says but
[23:07] you're sanctified but you are justified
[23:09] in the name of the Lord Jesus and by the
[23:12] spirit of our God and he says all things
[23:15] are lawful underneath nothing here he's
[23:17] talking about he's talking about new
[23:19] level of justification I believe because
[23:22] he says I will not all things are not
[23:25] expedient all things are lawful for me
[23:26] but I will not be brought under the
[23:29] power of any and when you get the
[23:32] universe that's when God's powers on the
[23:34] inside of you power to put you in a
[23:36] service you will not be brought under
[23:38] the power of the things that used to be
[23:40] a power in you now you're intervening to
[23:43] a higher level of justification where
[23:45] you could stand before God just where
[23:47] his own life is inside of your soul if
[23:51] his life is in your soul and you can't
[23:53] you can't help how you can hold anything
[23:55] against the charge of a Christian
[23:57] against a believer because there's
[23:59] something inside of there that's
[24:00] different than the way it used to be
[24:06] that's the reason we're going to send in
[24:08] a visible union hold on sake yes that's
[24:13] the reason you have to be born again you
[24:16] have to separate you have to dodge that
[24:19] first husband you can't live with it you
[24:22] just can't say well I'll divorce him and
[24:24] hang him up here until occasion no sirve
[24:26] no writing of divorcement he dies the
[24:30] nature of the world has to die every
[24:33] speck of him has to die you have to be
[24:35] reunited again with another nature I
[24:40] just got the more minutes up to the
[24:44] born-again Christian of the missing your
[24:45] first husband is dead you know he did
[24:48] God let it die it's finished and we're
[24:53] still talking I justification now of
[24:56] course now there's so many things that
[24:58] go into these I don't want I don't want
[25:00] you off track because we're talking
[25:02] about justification sanctification the
[25:04] Badgers Nolan jokes moving on up move it
[25:07] higher and higher higher forms of an
[25:10] anointing the physical unit abroad
[25:11] across program said your old book of
[25:14] divorcement is put away and it's dead
[25:17] absolutely out of existence even in the
[25:20] mind of God and then in invisible you
[25:25] know the Bride of Christ pahrump said
[25:26] again look up the word the word don't
[25:28] mean forgiven the word means justify it
[25:32] don't mean that you're forgiven and
[25:34] skipping down the old union the old
[25:37] union is in the sea of God's forgiveness
[25:43] now here's the key you wasn't married to
[25:47] it to begin
[25:48] now this is some deep stuff right here
[25:51] you wasn't married to it to begin with
[25:54] because what's he doing he's taking
[25:56] bringing us back full circle back to a
[26:01] union with God Leia should have been in
[26:04] the beginning he the bridegroom bored or
[26:07] shame himself for you in your place he
[26:11] took your place for you and
[26:13] predestinated for him to be in his bride
[26:15] before the foundation of the world and
[26:18] and then I say message he says you your
[26:21] first wedding was an old it was you've
[26:23] never done it in the first place because
[26:26] there's only one thing to do it that
[26:28] will be God come down himself and took
[26:31] your place in a form of the Son of God
[26:33] Jesus Christ and watched you by the
[26:35] water of the washing of the lord of the
[26:37] world now now when you've got the new
[26:41] birth now you're in a different realm of
[26:45] justification that may be it may be
[26:47] there might be a different way to say
[26:48] that but to the best of my ability I'm
[26:52] expressing it this way who shall lay
[26:55] anything to the charge of God's elect
[26:58] because in the center of your soul and
[27:00] down in your soul is God himself and how
[27:04] can you charge God for doing anything
[27:07] that's that's why when you get the new
[27:09] birth there's no more conscious of
[27:11] seeing ya you have no more desire for
[27:13] seeing how can that soul that's now
[27:16] eternal with God be judged anymore
[27:19] because it is just it is righteous it is
[27:23] justified in your soul yes who shall lay
[27:27] anything to the charge of God's elect it
[27:30] is God that justified
[27:35] Hebrews 10 once or two cents for the law
[27:38] having a shadow of good things to come
[27:40] another very image of the things can
[27:44] never with those sacrifices which they
[27:46] offer year by year continually make the
[27:48] comers very to perfect but then when
[27:50] they not have ceased to be offered
[27:51] because the the worshippers once perched
[27:53] should have had no more conscious of
[27:56] sins which is what the new birth gives
[27:59] you no more conscious of sins of course
[28:03] this is one of the way tale the genuine
[28:06] evidence of a new birth no conscious of
[28:10] sin this is admony you walking in the
[28:12] garden naked but there was no conscious
[28:16] of seeing they were naked but they
[28:19] didn't realize that there might be some
[28:21] kind of bad implication of that and it
[28:24] realized that the that you know somebody
[28:27] could say well y'all are naked know what
[28:29] what are you talking about no conscious
[28:32] of sin that the things that when you get
[28:38] the new birth of things that had a
[28:40] former hold on you you can say well well
[28:43] I had a problem with alcohol or all
[28:47] these cigarettes and stuff but now I'm
[28:49] going again and sometimes I still
[28:51] struggle with that God will remove the
[28:54] conscious of seeing completely from from
[28:57] your songs from your innermost being so
[29:00] that remember he's like a that soul is
[29:04] the control tower of the person and that
[29:06] the control tower is perfect it bought a
[29:10] new birth then it's going to set the
[29:12] believer in action to move in the right
[29:15] way so that there is no more conscious
[29:18] of seed now I I'm getting to work
[29:21] sitting in the spirit so hang only for a
[29:25] second but in that soul how can you
[29:28] accuse the soul of the believer of
[29:30] cigarette problems you will have
[29:32] problems in your spirit and
[29:34] but not that kind of problem you say you
[29:37] see a believer going into a brothel or
[29:41] something like that name that's not they
[29:43] probably got a problem we're talking
[29:44] about there is no more conscious of sin
[29:47] and we know seeing is unbelief when that
[29:50] new birth comes into the innermost that
[29:52] Oh God Jones with a solar planet you
[29:56] cannot disbelieve God's Word and here's
[30:01] the thing let's jump straight to 122
[30:04] wish we had some time later than a few
[30:06] minutes looky here for he a worshiper
[30:08] once purged the worshiper once perked
[30:13] has no more conscious of sin sin has
[30:16] passed from it and acts 13 35-39 and buy
[30:24] him all that believe are justified from
[30:26] all things for which you could not be
[30:28] justified by the law of Moses justified
[30:32] from all things that's kind of what I
[30:37] mean yeah I was really hoping program
[30:38] said that when you preach you what do
[30:40] you want you want to convict the heart
[30:42] of the people that make them feel
[30:45] ashamed in the nitration but others
[30:47] there already are Christian you want to
[30:49] give them something to keep moving
[30:51] higher and higher on me so I may be one
[30:54] of my aims this morning is a to convict
[30:58] the heart and and give us all something
[31:00] to aspire to something greater and
[31:02] greater because the gospel really is
[31:05] really simple if it can be revealed try
[31:07] maybe don't minds and then maybe you
[31:12] know I my thick head is sometimes
[31:15] something it takes a while for for God
[31:17] to get through it to get to it sometimes
[31:19] but if it really is once it begins to be
[31:22] open to you it is really simple and it's
[31:27] so simple that the lies in the time I
[31:29] show right over let me let me kind of
[31:32] wrap up here a minute let me see where a
[31:33] good place to stop yeah this is this is
[31:41] a good Scripture now stop right on this
[31:43] one Matthew 11 28 come unto me all ye
[31:46] that labor and are heavy laden and I
[31:48] will give you rest take my yoke upon you
[31:51] and learn of me for I am meek and lowly
[31:53] nan and he shall find rest unto your
[31:55] souls for my yoke is easy and my burden
[31:58] is life why is his yoke easy because you
[32:02] have to do nothing for salvation I
[32:04] program so how are you have to preach
[32:06] I'm just preaching because I love the
[32:08] Lord and I love his people but we don't
[32:11] have to do anything for salvation all
[32:13] you have to do is believe on god and
[32:15] when you do that he shot he shall find
[32:19] rest unto your souls honest a rest unto
[32:22] your souls because your soul is now
[32:25] eternal but you can still have problems
[32:29] in your spirit and so i'm gonna stop
[32:31] right there that'll give you some things
[32:33] about maybe
