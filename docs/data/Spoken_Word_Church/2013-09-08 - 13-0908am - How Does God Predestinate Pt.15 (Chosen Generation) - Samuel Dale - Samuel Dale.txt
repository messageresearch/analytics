then go into questions and answers had a real good time last night at the Bible study and everything so just remember what is the next time is the what is the theophany will be the next one next month so just remember that now we may excuse me we we October is according to when the the uh Fall Festival Falls so we may have to move it okay all right but just remember all that okay uh Romans 8 and Ephesians 1 so let's pray we got all the all of the announcements anybody anything else okay Heavenly Father we thank you for this day and your love unto us thank you for all things thank you for Calvary because without Calvary where would we be we pray now that you would just bless us as we read your word and as we talk about you and have Fellowship around the word of the hour that we believe and we pray that you would just guide each and every one of us teach us to wait upon you reach down and touch our wife Lord and deliver her from that problem with her back and her hips and her her stomach and everything Lord and we pray that that all would work out cuz we believe you that by your stripes she's healed and we we claim it and we Proclaim it because we're know that we have prayed and committed it to you and we believe you now just come and make it a manifestation have your way Lord forgive our sins as we want to make sure to keep us covered by the blood guide us in Jesus name amen Romans 8 and we know that all things work together for good to them that love God to them who are the called according to his purpose for whom he did for know he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many Brethren moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called and whom he called them he also Justified and whom he justified them he also glorified I love this part what shall we then say say to these things if all of this up here is true what can we say if God be for us who can be against us all right let's go on over to Ephesians 1 and we'll read 3-14 blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who has blessed us with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places in Christ according as he had chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein Heath made us accepted in the Beloved let's stop there because we won't get down that far anyway so you may be seated we'll just stop there on that verse main part we were getting is the chosen in him as we'll get to it all right we've been talking about predestination and talking about how does God predestinate and we found that he predestines by for knowledge and being an infinite God he knows all things before they'll take place so he can go ahead and say Jacob have I loved and Esau have I hated as the Bible says even before they were born all right because he knows all things now if that's not the kind of a God your serving I'd sure try to find one that did uh I don't want a God Like a peanut brain like myself that keep keeps changing his mind I I want something I can depend on and you know and believe and then 40 years from now I can still be believing it you know and and not worry about it cuz I want to I I want to keep it that way but now we've been I said talking about it and seeing and and and knowing that by for knowledge he could then actually write the Bible before the world there shouldn't be any problem with that if he's God now if he's not god let's just eat drink and be merry cuz tomorrow we die so what you know we fall off with some glorified monkey tree is that the way we think no we know for assurity that there is a God because by looking around and seeing even the things we see testifies of it and shows you know uh you know you explain to me the human body and how it works how all of those little old Parts in there keeps everything to going now you explain that and I won't have to worry about trying to explain God to you because somebody had to create that he said well it was just a polywog and it rolled up well who got who created the poliwog see you know so we just end the whole thing you know but now thinking about it and we've got up to the point to where that we are talking about God and His thinking and how that we read there in the scriptures you know that those who he justified he's already even glorified but that's in his mind now that's not in reality in you and I right the we're still human beings we're still subject to the world we're still you know uh having to eat drink and everything you know and and doings and and but when when God looks down and sees anything finished then it it is a finished product and we don't have to worry about it so then he sees everything from what he was before the world and as we read there in Romans those who he forn know he could predestinate all right now that's not the old doctrines of predestination that come down to organized religion like your your uh Armenian style of doing is more or less uh uh we got to make sure we work right and do right and this right and that right because we could be predestinated that way and and then the other side is the Calvinism that looks at it as well you know I was always safe so it don't make no difference uh one of these days God will contact me and I get to go to heaven well you know sometimes I wish some of those things were right but it's not so then we just don't worry about it but to see that God fornew what you would do and then he could predestinate which is means Destiny determined beforehand he could look down through time and see that you would want to be saved all so then he could make a plans for that he could come you know and release his life to where it would be ready to come into you and I when we would come into the world all right you know and receive it as not a person back there but come into the world of the basis of growing up and coming to the age of accountability and make a decision and receive the new birth see then we know that God has given us eternal life now uh in no way do I believe in any form of Eternal sunship we've been through that uh a son has a beginning and if a son has a beginning can not be Eternal so we don't believe in that we we'll get to it in a minute we believe in Eternal godship because God is eternal that's right but you and I had a time that we began and we have a time that we will end if we're not born again we will be annihilated somewhere you know in the Lake of Fire and all of that because we're we had a beginning right but if we can receive eternal life into our soul then that eternal life had no beginning that's the main thing I'm trying to get us to see now is to look at it in the bases that if we have eternal life then that eternal life is God's own life there's not two or three Eternal lives right there's only one eternal life and that's God all right God's Own Life coming and living in you and I to make us Eternal giving us what we call the New Birth you know the the the salvation and that's where the Nicodemus he couldn't understand and you know he said you know what do you mean I must be born again well he was simply telling him he needed to die up to his and receive the life that he was going to give but he couldn't understand that do we understand it do understand that what we are as mortal beings you know time doomed people age Factor getting older older and you know wrinkled and gray-headed and Noire and everything else and you know because we're on our way down we're just mortal but God came to make a way and he did through Jesus Christ upon the Earth because we know that Jesus Christ was not a second person or a third person or something like that he was God made manifest in human flesh all right then in being that then we we try to find out by the new birth like the prophet said one day he said God didn't send a son said would you send your child to die or would you go yourself well of course the way it is nowadays most people would send the kid first you know but that's not the way God does things you know all right but getting to the point then and we read there in Ephesians that we were chosen in him amen all before the foundation of the world all right now we're trying to show uh for knowledge and understanding and getting back into the mind of God without having to be that like God will that all be saved he wanted he died for everybody he gave his life to everybody in the world all of the billions of trillions of people that's been in the world that he died to to give his life for everybody but everybody's not going to accept accept it all right so then he gives us a free moral agency to accept or reject or a right to the fact of where we choose if we want to be saved or not not he's not going to make us saved he will not override that and save you when you don't want to be saved but neither will he kick you away if you want to be amen because he lives that up to us as a choice we can receive our reject all right now in doing that then would there be any problem that God could set before the world and look down through time and see who would want to be saved and who wouldn't that shouldn't be any trouble that that should be sensible all right but yet we try to make our things in a great understanding you know but we read it says were chosen in him right now I've emphasized lately a lot on this point and I want to keep doing it if we think we were chosen of him and we're reading the scripture that we were chosen in him but our human mind is Translating that as to be of instead of in because see we think we were chosen of him but there's no scripture say we were chosen of him it said we were chosen in him right in other words when he was chosen I was chosen when he was accepted I was accepted I wasn't back there to receive it but I receive it now because I believe that he died in my place all right so there's a vast difference between chosen in him and chosen of him if you you put it as I said the other day and talking about it a little last night if you put it that we were chosen of him then that means god Stamped Out who he wanted and he's a respector of person he's not just he would be condemning others for dying and going to hell when he'd have no way he can condemn them but if he gives everybody a choice let you decide your own choice then you can't go to judgment and say but I didn't have a chance you say yes you did yes you did you remember when you were that you remember you see then it won't be he won't have to have no great big screen to pull up cuz he can just pull it up in your mind and just you know like that and you'll say okay yeah I know I done it all right like we've always said it won't be the real bad sinner at judgment that will argue with God because they'll know who they were were right right but you take a religious fanatical religious person see the Bible says that they said there you know uh Jesus said depart from me I never knew you right well that didn't mean he didn't know about them right you but he never knew him he never had any relationship into the point with them to where they could become children but he knew all about them because being infinite all right so then when the religious person walks up and they'll say have not I cast out Devils that's what scripture says they'll do and he'll say depart from me he doesn't argue with them when casting out Devils he know they've done it right but yet they never come to an experience of Salvation to a position to where that they could be have something inside of them right instead of just having some knowledge some idea some thought all right so we're going to talk about now a chosen generation and in doing that I didn't give these scriptures to the brothers so I'll just go ahead and read a little bit but in 2 Thessalonians 2 and13 it says but we are bound to give thanks always to God for you Brethren beloved of the Lord because God had from the beginning chosen you to Salvation through sanctification of the spirit and belief of the truth now he's chosen you all right see now that goes to the same of choosing chosen in him it's not chosen you like stamping out I'm going to save this one but I'm going to leave that one no he doesn't do his work like that he wouldn't be a just God so you could argue with him at judgment but there'll be no argument with God go is all finished all right so then we're what we're we were chosen what now youed to Salvation through sanctification of the spirit he he made it then that we would come to a basis of Salvation right amen and I believe in that I don't believe and we'll get to it later in the message as a lot of people believe we come into the world with eternal life I don't believe that you said well Prophet said so and so well let's wait and see what he did say amen I Believe by representation of predestination yeah sure we'll get to those things but I believe that you and I have to accept our salvation and I believe Jesus Christ had to die to release that life that was in him where he come back in me and you he didn't have to come to just give us a head knowledge that's right you know an intellectual conception right he come to give us a new birth that's why he said to Nicodemus you must be born again look at a man that spent his whole life serving God living in the temple all he' done all of his life was went to church and serve God prayed so many times a day fasted so much done everything but when he was facing Jesus he said you must be born again well Nicodemus couldn't understand that all right because he thought he had everything but in the face of God he didn't have it all right but now watch see from the beginning he's chosen you let's go over to 1 Peter 2 and9 it says but you are a chosen generation what now a royal priesthood and holy nation A peculiar people now that's a whole lot isn't it I mean you think about what it is but you are a chosen generation your royal priesthood you remember the high priest had to make the offerings you know he he made the offering for everybody but see in the New Testament form you are the high priest you're the head of your household you're the the the husband then would be the the the head of the house all and the father you know head of the family and in doing those things see we don't have to go down and offer a sacrifice you know a goat or a lamb or something no but our sacrifice is Jesus Christ but he made us over in the Book of Revelation called us priests and Kings every Born Again believer has a right now to go in the holy of holies where in the Old Testament only the high priest could go and he just went once a year but now you have a right to go straight before God and talk to God about what you have need of because you're a priesthood all right but now you're a holy nation that's not a natural Nation it is the the body of Jesus Christ all right A peculiar people I like that God's people are always peculiar they're odd you know we don't have to do anything to be odd you're just odd you why is it that you walk in a store and you sisters go in with your dresses on and your hair and things and and the world looks at you and they'll walk up to you've never cut your hair see you're just a witness against people right just being a people you're peculiar am you're odd you know and you stand out and the women stand out more than men do us men wein nothing but ugly bunch of mud you know it don't matter because we not need bleed bunch of nothings but the the sisters stand out because of what they represent the church all right the bride of Christ But A peculiar people now watch in a minute as we get to a couple of scriptures but if you ever notice that what it says there it says we're a chosen generation now that word generation from uh bringing it down from the strong concordance is 1085 which means a kind a chosen generation they probably got it they they get faster than I am most of the time oh look what it says about it's roll it back down you too high there you go it means a kind and this word of generation you know a chosen generation it means a kind it means a kindred it means an offspring it means a nation it means a stock it means a born or diversities and and you know miscellaneous thing it's like a race or a a stock or a race or a nation in other words nationality or descent from a particular people see meaning that we're different right we're a chosen Generation generation amen right generation regen right amen but we were gened wrong right amen right Mom and Daddy done the best they could do we're not blaming them don't blame Adam and Eve in the garden but we were were gened that way made that way come down through genealogy as we call it and come out to who we are but see the new birth then makes you a different people a royal priesthood not a nation anality of Nations but the word Gentile we're in the Gentile dispensation as we call it Gentile means Nations see that way anybody can be born again in this day you know you don't have to be a certain Israeli lineage or something because it's it's a genealogy it it's doing it all right now watch then if we look at it and keep it correct in our thinking that we were chosen in him then that's how we can be a different kind of people that's how we can be a different Kindred from what mankind is that's how we can be his offspring as we'll get to it in a minute Paul said to the to them on Mars Hill The Offspring of God the children of God all see because that's what we are right all right we're born we're a family we're race you and I are or a race of people that has never you know the the the world thinks about all these super races that they got you know they they got all this fighting people and doing things you know and they claim it that's what Adolf Hitler was trying to do was was make a super blonde Race To Rule The World all he already his W was telling us he already had a place bought out here in California or somewhere back before he was so he was so dead set on Conquering the world he already had them building place here in America yeah but he wanted to have a super race of people well I I believe in a super race of people am but I believe in a born again believer being part of a super rush that's what he's that's what God has done for you and I by giving us eternal life he has made us to a place that we're different amen as I said we don't have to be right if you have to be different you're not a Christian you're an actor right that's right the word f the word Pharisee look it up it means actor and they were acting religious that's why when Jesus talked to him see and said you're your father the devil well they was decided right then they better get rid of the old boy because he wasn't according to their knowledge all right but now think about it if we were chosen in him now to get to the thought a chosen generation then we must be part of God and being that way we must be as Jesus was almighty God made manifest in flesh amen called a son that was all right because that human flesh did have a beginning it came from a mother it had a time you know of course he never did call her mother showing that it was a virgin birth but looking at Jesus to see how he was not just a part of God he was God made manifest all right now you and I then we will never be all of God by ourself because that's he's got children all right I mean we are his children right and if we are his children then one child is never no different Wade was the first one but DNA wise that made him no difference in Terren and see in Anna even being a girl see it didn't make no difference in the the DNA makeups and things it doesn't make one over the other you said well he's the firstborn well that's fine but everybody in the Kingdom of this one gets the same one because we're all children of the firstborn amen so in this family you and I are his offspring we're his children right amen that's what I've tried to get us to look back there that before the world God was D amen we'll read in a minute he was D with his attributes right and you're the attribute of your mother and father but you couldn't Fellowship until you got here so You' just be a gene back in your great granddaddies and and then as we were saying the other day then even when it come to to my mother and my daddy just because they got married that day didn't mean I was born the next one right I was a 13th so it took a long time to get me here all right so now I had to be a gene not a germ not a sperm those were never made until Mama and Daddy come to the bedroom as we'd call it then it develops into a a a a germ called a sperm and woman produces the egg but just remember the egg and the sperm until they're together there's no seed a seed you got to have the the the the cell and the The Germ the sperm together and then when that contacts you make a seed see then I could come forth from that right right and see that's the way it was with God when you look back to see what were we before the foundation world we were just a part of God Amen if you have eternal life right now if not we're not part of God now that's sensible that's why you got to be born again that's what he was telling Nicodemus he said Nicodemus you need eternal life well he thought he already had everything you and he was a good guy you know lined up real good find anything wrong with a guy back there they just take him out and kill him it didn't matter where his high priest or who he was they' kill him because that was the law right but you see then coming into where we're at we see that Jesus was almighty God manifested in flesh amen he was not a second person he was not a third person he was not even a first person you remember I gave that the other night on the unveiling of God paragraph 74 he was the person because if you say Jesus was the first person that means they can be other persons no he was God Almighty in human flesh are the biggest liar the world ever seen I have no problem talking like that got to know who I'm talking about but if he was the second person of the Trinity that we talk about you know that the world believes in God the Father father God the son God the Holy Ghost I want scripture for that I mean I I want a scripture that ever called him God the son they called him Son of God right but never called him God the son because it would mean that he had a beginning and then you go into co-equal and co-eternal that's right right Blessed Trinity co-equal coeternal come on sensible language father son Holy Ghost son had a beginning how can a son be co-equal with his father how can he be of the same age yeah a sensible he all you're just using terminologies well what are you thinking your brain's running your brain's running off the terminologies that you've heard all your life you've been taught all your life that there was three gods and then you've been brought down from that to someone say no there not three Gods Baptist Doctrine I came from there I know it Baptist Doctrine is one God but when you explain it it's God in three persons Blessed Trinity which is the same as any other believing in three Gods right yeah Jesus in you don't go to no Jesus we don't believe in Oneness Oneness went this way Trinity went that way Oneness says he's one like your finger the Old Testament was Jehovah then Jesus now holy ghost all Trinity runs you off into the three neither one of them is correct bring it together in the middle Jesus said unless you believe that I am he amen you will die in your sin no who's the he talking about right he said I and my father are one amen well now what that should have been I and my father are two but we don't know how to explain it that's what Billy Graham said said about it not throwing off on him but I read it in the newspaper one day he said it can't be explained I said what you need is a revelation what you need is a revelation then you need a an experience and then when you do you come down to see that there's just one true and living God are we going to get up to heaven there going to be a God over here it's a pillar of fire and a God over here it's a son and a God over here it's a father or something no take what Jesus said he said if you seen me that's right you've seen the father that's right there in human flesh dwelling on Earth that that flesh had a beginning Hebrews 10:5 a body thou Hast prepared me in that body dwelt the soul and the spirit of almighty God that's right and that's why it was God made manifest in flesh man why did they kill him they said you're a man making yourself God read your scripture no it was God making a man standing in front of him but see we don't see it and we don't try to bring it into the correct understanding because we don't believe in Eternal sunship how could you have an eternal son well don't you believe that we have eternal life right but we're not Eternal Sons right come on we're the children of God which have eternal life and we can be called a son right as I keep referring to it Dar in Daniel where they said Nebuchadnezzar said we throw three in there and there's a fourth man down there and it killed the guys that throw a men and he looked down and he said it must be the Son of God Amen that's right that man at least had sin because he knew that somebody protected them three h children right and if somebody protected him it could only be God and if he could see him it wouldn't be correct see cu the Bible say no man has seen God at any time but the only begotten have declared him or brought him forth right all right dark standing on Earth was almighty God in human flesh right all right and by the new birth that we must receive to have eternal life on Amen I put this in every message we must receive eternal life well uh what about all these let's get to these quotes in a minute it's like Wade said about the brother saying something he said our daddy come along use the same quotes and come it over here and bring it this way this brother bring it over that way you know wouldn't it that way would we done it then we all used to say Lord Jesus Christ father son Holy Ghost bring it together and one of you got amen Father Son and Holy Ghost Lord Jesus Christ we bring it together as the one right all right now in getting to it then we don't believe in an eternal sunship but we believe in an eternal godship you remember I gave you that one thinking uh thirsting for Life paragraph or E12 1957 not Eternal godhead I mean Eternal sunship but it's the Eternal where's it at in the middle all it could be an eternal godship but never an eternal sunship a son is one that's begotten just son has a beginning right right Jesus the body had a beginning and it had to be redeemed not that it was sinful but it had to be made Eternal right in the resurrection all right but see inside of there was the Eternal God that's it well what is the new birth amen same thing no no brother Dale we're the son of Jesus that's the son of God then that makes you a grandchild right right if we don't believe in Eternal sunship for Jesus how did Jesus give us eternal life that's why Paul said it summed it up and he says we're Heirs of God right and join ours with Christ then whatever God is Christ would have to be the same and and if we receive that life come on then we are his children amen all right now and what did he do see God poured himself out on the day of Pentecost out of him came that eternal life right the into thy hands I Comm in my spirit is that what he said on the cross we see that same holy spirit that was dwelling in him that same God came back on the day of Pentecost in the form of the baptism of the Holy Ghost the disciples wasn't sitting up in the upper room and all at once they they got a knowledge that they always was you see where the devil has tried to pull it over on us right I don't fight what's out there he nothing out there to fight ain't no fight for a trinity you you know just you just blow them off and go on I don't mean that wrong I respect people I sit down and listen to them talk but then I just like to ask a few simple questions and that's the way I do now in the message of people right if we came into the world with eternal life then Jesus Christ died in vain that's right that's a simple qu answer to me I mean I don't take a whole theological discussion it just takes common sense Amen to realize that we were lost amen but yet he come to pay the price amen and as far as God is concerned as we read in Romans those he's Justified he's already glorified as far as he's concerned it's over with but we must receive it all right B says the gift of the Holy Ghost which is eternal life now let's start start off on Number Two Brother Anderson and just pick up our thoughts and I want you to get this really good paragraph 153 there roll it on up you read all the other before you get to it but look what he says this life that's within us all right that was in 1963 uh 11 or 117 1963 the life that's in US is not only a creative life now watch hold that point but it's a part of his own life so now really what's he saying he's saying that the part we have in US is not a creative life cuz that would be something different that's right he's saying it's a part of you know part of him that's the reason we have the authority to speak to the devil because it's God's Own creative life now where if you're anointed correctly not you it's not you that speaketh but the father that dwelleth in you see take no thought what you'll say because it'll be added at that time just go on stay with it he said I love it so then we are not a creative being of God we're a part of God that's what he's explaining it's a part of his own life so you isolate a quote you can worry yourself to death on it you can kill yourself trying to just like the Bible I can read you in the Bible where it's said to baptize in the name of the father and of the son and of the Holy Ghost that's in the Bible Matthew 28:19 about 10 days later Peter is asked men and Brethren what must we do to be saved you repent everyone and be bapti in the name of Jesus Christ now Peter was supposed to be the spokesman you know the the the guy that was supposed to understand he had the Keys of the Kingdom and he couldn't remember 10 days what the Lord Jesus told him now he said exactly what the Lord Jesus said they said Holy Ghost Father Son and Holy Ghost those those are not names what it says in the Bible Matthew 28:19 read it in the name of the father and of the son and of the Holy Ghost what's the name of the father Son and the Holy Ghost Lord Jesus Christ that's right sensible amen right father son Holy Ghost Lord Jesus Christ simple language then show me in the Bible where anybody was ever baptized Father Son and Holy Ghost and show me in history until the Catholic Church changed it and I'll show you in history where they changed it I'll give you a list in my office and you go home and read your own encyclopedias and it'll show you the Catholic Church Chang the way of baptizing to Father Son and Holy Ghost right nobody in the Bible was ever baptized that way right that's right it's also about 100 years later or something like that close that they started changing it but yet we believe the Catholic church but no no no I believe the Bible well now you got a contradiction father son Holy Ghost Lord Jesus Christ you got a contradiction and you say you believe in it you say you believe God's word is pure and true amen come on now I'm saying that for one point this way we say we believe a prophet's message amen and yet we're always trying to prove I'm not us now people are trying to prove him wrong you know why because if you can prove somebody wrong you don't have to worry about what he said right if you can prove to me the Bible's wrong then we'll Tire the Bible up throw it away right if God can't keep his word straight out there's no God I got on my study there at the house you know Darwin's theory you know that the monkey well I found this somewhere that we was cleaning out a house with teren and and I brought that thing home I got sitting on my study you know you'd have doing you'd have Darwin if you were looking at you'd have Darwin sitting with the skull of a monkey you know and looking at it and trying to figure out if we come what I've got is a monkey sitting with Darwin's head and I like it yeah he'd take a monkey to figure all that out so I said well to go he saidwell we all come from this who started it that's it right there and I'd like to know how you give an alligator to a bird I never could figure that out I mean that that's beyond me anyway but you know you try to do it but now watch so then it's not that we are a creative life of God right that would mean that that you were saying that we were chosen by him and then he' create us see that would make you something separate from him and you can't create anything Eternal you you got enough sense to know that if you created at a beginning so it's not to say that we are a creative life we are why because we're human Mortals out here this is creative life this what you're looking at is creative life it's not Eternal but see inside of it is a part of God Amen by the new birth all right then being that then that part is not creative see the eternal life you have is not create that's why we we we Baptist and to off on them I just talk plain we'd say well I hope I'm going to heaven I believe I'm going to heaven maybe I'm going to heaven the Methodist come along and said well if you're Sanctified today and you die you're going to heaven but if you're not Sanctified you're not going to make it see everybody's always worried about going to heaven right happy hunting ground for the old Indian you know everybody's concerned about something after this world I'm not concerned about what's after this world that's right that's right right cuz I realize if I don't receive eternal life while I'm in this world I'm going to have to go before the white Throne judgment amen but if I receive eternal life here I don't have to worry about the Judgment because the Bible said I passed from Death un life it's not going to be one of these days we're going up there and decide whether we're going to heaven or not uh-uh somebody's going to get it right here because the Bible says we're changed in a moment twink of an eye and I believe that's what this message came to do I to bring us to a place to see who we are and what we're doing here the prophet said when she realizes that said she'll be gone well I think we're beginning to realize that I ain't worried about Obama and it Obamacare I never did worry about him to start with you know I appreciate uh retiring from General Motors I appreciate that glad to get a check I appreciate that but I don't have to worry about it I can live without it I can go down to Walmart and get me a greeters card on the front and make a living and I will do it if I have to I can't stand this generation of people well you know if I if I go down there and put in that I'll only get uh $7 an hour and I've got this degree and I'm not working for somebody for seven an hour will starve to death amen but now here comes the government to feed all of them sorry Bunch right that's why I'm not against that that's that's just all the governments and everything else well I'm not going to work two jobs to make a living you sorry lazy bum anything else you want me to say I don't have no troubles with it because I work for a living that's right I started pastoring this church right here I was working at gentle Motors that's right and I didn't have nobody to preach with me after brother Mo got sick and the problem I by myself preaching three times a week and working at General Motors and sometimes working 50 60 hours a week CU we work 10 hours a day and 8 hours on Saturday so that'd be 50 8 hours we had to do and I was building houses and building on to the church and doing all that and preaching three times a week you lazy bunch of preachers that's what I told a man one time he said you know he said I'm just work to death this week I said what'd you do he told me what he done I said my Lord man if I called his name everybody here know I said I told him how many hours I'd work and how much I'd travel and how much work I'd done at building houses and churches and I and I said besid that I'm preaching three times a week I said you need a job he did he he had too much spare time sorry about that that just get down to show you what I think about life I'm not against Obama it wouldn't have been no different if McCain would have been put in office probably went down quicker I'm not a Republican or a Democrat my Kingdom's not of this world that's what I was saying while IO my kingdom is is from above all this stuff ain't going to be there why because Paul said we are his offspring all right let's get to that scripture go ahead and pull it up brother I get away with my notes sorry about that acts 17 pull up number four CU I want you to look at the scripture there it and I want you to think about it Paul is explaining on Mars Hill to those people you remember they had all kind of gods they had all kind of thing and they had a little cubicle or something made and and they had a little sign there and just in case they forgot one cuz they had you know nobody tell them how many they had but they had a sign that said to the unknown God right just in case they forgot read the book of Acts they can roll it down from there but just in case that they missed one of them Paul said that's the one I want to talk to you about the unknown God now he's quoting them that's a good way to get a fell to listen to you see their Doctrine was that mankind was The Offspring of God they just had many gods many daddies I guess you call so look at it for in him we live and move and have our being as certain also of your own poets you putting it back to them have said for we are also his offspring put it right back in their lap this is the guy I want to talk to you about this unknown God right and you say we are his offspring look up that word Offspring children Kindred Etc the same things I gave you on generation right all right but look at the scripture for as much then as we are The Offspring of God but have you ever thought about the rest of that for as much as we are The Offspring of God we ought not to think that the godhead is liken to gold or silver or stone Graven by Art and man's devices you've ever thought about that what that means you ever just considered that part we quote the first of it we Offspring but have you ever considered what he's saying can I give brother Dale's understanding okay and just talk a little bit about it for as much then as we are The Offspring we are the children of God Amen now if we are the children of God right we ought not to think that the godhead is some kind of an image that you guys have set up over here to your own your gods and left one to the unknown is that what he's saying that's right what right do you and I have with thinking of God being other anything other than a person yet that's been the hardest thing for me to try to preach for 40 something years that God is a being not like the wind blowing about right he has a headquarters he has a heaven to live in come on Earth is foot tool in Heavens he's a person no God is a spirit you're quoting scripture but keep on quoting right God is a being he's a person the baptism of the Holy Ghost is a person we'll get down to it later like w was said there hoo or brother Joe one of the two in the office or want to go see we say well that's just a spot that's in you well I don't have a spot in me a spot in my soul is no good that's right because Devil's got a lot of spot there until you're born again but if God is a person now you're just trying to make him some kind of a something tangible hey we come from there so he must be more tangible than we are right right God must more be more real than what you're looking at or I'm beating on why cuz he created it see then we shouldn't in no way think about the godhead is being right some kind of a gold or images or anything we talk about that's right we should think of the godhead as being almighty God not Eternal sunship as we're talking about but Eternal godship I believe in an eternal godhead I gave you the quote from the prophet the other day on that Eternal godhead what not a father son like a son we think of but a father Son and Holy Ghost is a three attributes of God that's right and he's Eternal amen so let's don't think about well I wonder what God is oh he just a spirit he's just floating around see we've had a message to explain those things I'll be glad somebody write and send it to me I'll be glad to give you the quotes where the Prophet said God is a being he is not like the wind that's aoya the African word amoya which means I breathe and you breathe my soul goes to you and your soul goes to me that's what the amoyal word means that's not true that's not God God is a person he's real we're not going to get up to heaven and I goes a Halo oh hi Father no when we get there we'll see Jesus and we'll know who he is cuz he's almighty God Amen and you know how come we'll be able to see him because we'll be like him that's what the Bible said the Bible says as he is in this world so are we amen we'll get to that in a minute I got in the scripture what are you thinking about it see we shouldn't think about anything about the godhead except to believe that there's one true and living God CU if not we're not in idolatry if God is not real then okay let's go home eat drink and be marry cuz we die Darwin had it right we fell off over a glorified monkey tree but I don't believe in that I believe people are real I believe that even when you die and they take your body down they put it in the gray or they burn it that's not all of you you got a place to go to amen right to wait until a judgment day amen and you're called a soul so I believe in eternal life as a person not a thought or a concept if it's just a spec then a spec is not a person I believe the new birth is is the person of Jesus Christ coming in you to give you eternal life amen and that don't make you a second person that's right right amen right it makes you part of him amen all right let's give a couple of quotes CU I know we ain't going to get to we'll finish the season if we don't we'll finish Wednesday who worries we're Eternal people look what he says on the who is God preach the 19 uh 50 8:15 well they're getting there he comes down he says the Bible says we are Sons and Daughters of God he is Offspring yeah we got to get on the right one okay now we got we are Sons and Daughters of God is Offspring now when then we're something like God was and watch Jesus said himself it is written your Gods come on that's what the Bible says about you it don't say your sons are God it says you're Gods right written in your law we become a part of God a Son of God by adoption through Jesus Christ that's exactly right because he come to make a way where you and I could have eternal life that's right and he had to die to release that life that's right so then we're The Offspring of God Amen all right look at the look at we've been through the scripture let's see yeah we'll skip all right now watch what he says here and let's get these couple of things and then then I want to hit something that I want you to pay close attention and anybody on the internet system if you're going to miss this evening please come back and get it because we're going to get into some statements that a lot of people use but they're they're using them incorrectly you can make brother around say anything you want to just like you make the Bible say anything you want to but you can't take it all right you take all the Bible and it'll come out a beautiful picture no contradictions I want to see one oh these theologians say I want to see one I mean I'm on the internet come on I want to see a contradiction in the Bible but don't be dumb come up and say David had 40,000 chariots and then you read over here he's only got four over th over at Jerusalem man said that to me one time I said look he got 30 6,000 scattered somewhere else what are you talking about it didn't say he had all of them there see that's what we we we want to make some kind of little bitty silly thing you know you well brother Dale God is a Spirit Well I believe there was a certain man one day after his resurrection did he come walking among the people and they said it's a spirit you remember what he said he said a spirit hath not flesh and bone go get me something to eat what he done wasn't he he he actually ate some fish right he was real all right look chosen in him okay let's go ahead to number five sardian Church age paragraph or page 284 which is 284 Church age book this is the record God has given us eternal life and this life is in his son now he's coming bringing the scripture right he that hath the son ha life eternal and he that hath not the son hath not life eternal so if we're not born again we don't have eternal life sensible and those who have that life were in him now what he didn't say by him it were in him before the foundation of the world they were chosen in him before the foundation of the world that great Royal seed Jesus Christ was planted he died and that life that was in him came up through the wheat plants and is reproducing itself again in multitudes of wheat seeds having the same life in them and being like the original because by Spirit they are original oral coming up through the church ages coming up through time coming out to an end time to understand who we are what are you understanding you following my point yes and what I want you to do is I want you to read with me you know as we look at a few and we'll just have to get a few little things and then quit and come back this evening but I want you to listen very carefully to the reading and then you make up your own mind what's right the visitors and some you know they don't know what we're talking about in that basis but there's a lot of people in this message believe that we come into the world with eternal life y always living in US eternal life well that's Eternal sunship right that's Catholic doctrines that's that's those things I believe you must be born again to have eternal life but yet God by his great Infinite Wisdom knew who would be saved and who wouldn't so he could go ahead and set everything in motion that's right and when you come into the world you had to receive it I believe you must receive eternal life for that soul to be Eternal amen sir am amen yeah but I come in the world with an eternal Soul now I want that I want that in the prophet's message I want it in the Bible because Jesus died in Vine well you're just an intellectual smart El if my intellect can out preach your Holy Ghost I'd trade I've said that 40 years ago and I don't back up from it now if a man was an intellect can out preach a man with the Holy Ghost you need to do some swapping somewhere I had a great Theologian telling me he was a Greek scholar Theologian told me one day he said I can tear you apart with a word I said probably can again but he didn't change my thinking I said we'll still meet you anywhere you want to meet and give you three months to explain what you're talking about I want one service is all I want that wasn't sarcastic it just I knew where I was standing you think I was afraid of him because he was a Greek scholar no I respected him he went to school to learn all those things I didn't have the ability so I've got to depend on God right well we ain't never had none of those meetings but that's all right but now listen to what brother randam had to say there's a lot of emphasized said we we were always Eternal now I want you to just read with common sense all right go ahead and pull up number seven all right I want you to notice the little word if if is always a question the Bible says if the spirit of God be in you it will also Quicken your mortal body that's the scripture right if so that means if means if I was life in other day cuz I was thinking about it we was watching the a video on the president and know and you remember uh and I don't thought them cuz none of I bus but you remember uh the guy that said what is is you know I mean he just tra in words they could never get him do you have relationship I never had no relationship with her then he come up what what is is I laughed then you say to me what if what if what is if if is a question right all right now I got another statement to come behind that so don't turn me off on the internet the rest of people hear it okay you say if is a qu I'll go ahead and put it here make sure you don't lose you say if is is is not a question brother Dale it's a statement I'm glad you thought of that right cuz see the Holy Spirit already said they'll ask that they'll say if is not a question it's a statement amen so either way I'm right if it's a question of if or if it's a statement of if they're both the same now blow you see because I sitting in the study and I just say well Lord what are they going to say he says tell them this it's never been wrong yet so I ain't worried about it now if you've got eternal life tonight if we have eternal life to us then we always were well what he's saying we always were no he's questioning it or a statement of it if you have eternal life the eternal life in you always was eternal but that don't mean we were come on now if you got eternal life tonight if we have eternal life then we always work because there's only one form of eternal life we always were watch now and the reason we were because we are a part of God right because we're part of God if we have eternal life right that should be no problem with anybody right problem if we got it right but if we don't have it we and you can make all the statements you can say I got it and leave the if off and you made the same statement you see yeah but you just don't understand because we always were we who now we'll get back to it this evening course anybody misses it that statement right there is is made seven times eight times in the message if we two times he says if you have eternal life 17 times he said if you've got eternal life sound like questions to me he said no that's a statement okay then the statement and the question is the same the statement is I have eternal life but when did you get it amen well I come into the world with it well then you don't need Jesus Christ that's right right amen do away with your salvation course most of them them have most everybody's done away with salvation they just preach oh that's that old simple stuff back under and I keep giving that quote to you in the seal book he said go on with the same simple message cuz if not you'll work your way self away from it that's what they've done they've worked it way that we always we we we we're we're Eternal and I warned these brothers and warned them over and over and I keep warning on the internet that over and over you show me one of those doctrines and those people believing that they always was eternal and that is a two- Soul Doctrine whether you believe it or like it and you show me them and I'll call the names of them that every one of them went into polygamy now you know we're against that come on and see that's why people don't want to say nothing to me because I just put it too plain I know it I'm sorry but that's just what I am see he's saying if you have eternal life the eternal life that's in you always was eternal right amen amen right roll it on up to the other now we are a part of God now how do you become a part of God the only way a human mortal become part of God is get born again how the life of God right go now we are a part of God you always was that's right you don't remember it because you were only an attribute in God you were only in his thinking you were an attribute the question was asiz now what is an attribute expressed on an attribute is you are the attribute of your parents and in God you were an attribute there's only three attributes of God father son Holy Ghost so that means if any way in the world we were back there it's you're going to have to deal with Father Son and Holy Ghost as attributes an attribute of God is a part of God you remember the other day when I asked you the question is this what he thought of or is this the point of his thinking right which way you going come on have my made a statement I keep making them for people to listen he said well brother D I believe I was a predestinated seed okay that means a predetermined and hey we've done preached about four messages back on the other side of predestination going back by his for knowledge and now going back into the very thoughts itself I don't want to be what God thought of I want to be a part of that God that done to thinking then I don't have to worry about it see because eternal life folks is a person to me it's not a concept or a thought but yet they'll take these you know and they'll say see look at look look at that brother Dale you you just don't understand you he he he said you always was is yeah so that mean you're always Eternal how could you have eternal life in your soul and the devil being there at the same time now you explain that and you come and tell me that that ain't right you're making yourself an eternal sin you got to admit the soul had problems you got to admit the devil was there and then you going to put God there it don't even make sense to me and I don't have no education I'm sorry maybe I'm a dumb I can't understand but I'm just dumb enough to believe in one thing that you and I didn't come into the world with eternal life dwelling in our soul well I the prophet said it we're going to get to that where he says if you have eternal life not correcting nobody you're the one's correcting him cuz you're leaving off what he's saying you're coming with some kind of a doctrine that just makes you oh I just like I said Napoleon he's turn there with his hand I believe I was back there that's what everybody wants they want this thing back there I want this thing made Eternal amen if I don't believe that eternal life is a person it's not a thought or a concept I didn't get a knowledge one day that I saved I had met God I'd seen him and everything in the book Deacon for 5 years in the Baptist Church claiming salvation but when I heard that Prophet talking about eternal life and God being a person I immediately knew I didn't have the new birth and I didn't claim like everybody else that I came into the message so that proves I got eternal life I sought God for two years and I've had experiences to tell you things that a lot of people think you're just trying to make yourself something no I'm trying to tell the truth I've been in the presence of God so much I could smell his presence most wonderful smell you've ever but yet I don't call that my new birth read six books a day and listen to two tapes I don't call that my new birth I call the New Birth exactly what I believe it is Jesus said you must be born again and for you to be able to be born again I've got to go die you remember he breathed on the disciples and said receive you the Holy Ghost they didn't receive it right then and they'd walk with him for three and A2 years that was a promise that they had to go to the upper room well like I said come on Brothers like I said they was your scared to death in the upper room and they said we're not going out right they done seen too much go on and them disciples in that upper room that 120 they said we're not going going out but when that Holy Ghost fail that person of Jesus Christ come into their soul that's right they walked right straight out and being begin to declare the gospel wouldn't have scared of nobody Paul what beat three or five times with with enough Stripes if they give him one more according to the record it would killed him on each one and he's and yet all he could say was the life that I now live in this flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God it's not I that liveth but Christ that liveth in me he believed in a new birth I I don't believe the new birth is a knowledge that's I believe it's a person amen let's stand together what we got 1 139 this we'll take up here this evening read a lot if you have questions and answers Wednesday reing night and daybody name theas why you so happy Brother D Hallelujah with of me if heide of me he's going to have to kill me what you me inside of me I've got an advocate the scripture say he'll take care of me but he'll bring to my understanding that I got
