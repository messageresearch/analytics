our destruction we thank you for the testimonies the things of your love and your grace we love you now just have your way as we read your word you come and speak to our hearts in Jesus name Revelations 1 1 through3 the revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave unto him show unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass and he said and signified it by his Angel unto his servant John who bear record of the word of God and of the testimony of Jesus Christ of all things that he saw blessed is he that readeth and they that hear the words of this prophecy and keep those things which are written therein for the time is at hand all right now 1 Peter 1 beginning with verse 9 receiving the end of your faith even the salvation of your souls of which salvation the prophets have inquired and searched diligently who prophesied of the grace that should come unto you now what about all of those Old Testament prophets they were not speaking of themselves and things they were speaking about us and what would come to pass see verse 11 search searching water what manner of time the spirit of Christ which was in them did signify when it testified beforehand the sufferings of Christ see it was speaking of all the things and the glory that should follow unto whom it was revealed it was made known to them that it wasn't for them but unto whom it was revealed that not unto themselves but unto us they did Minister the things which are now reported among you by them that have preached the holy the gospel unto you with the Holy Ghost sent down from heaven which things the Angels desire to look into so what are we to do now wherefore G up the loins of your mind be sober and hope to the end for the grace that is to be brought unto you at the revelation of Jesus Christ you may be seated the Lord at his Blessing to the reading of the word now we're in the Book of Revelations trying to uh do a study on these things and we're coming up in and just now beginning to uh get to the point that we started on uh back about 2 months ago as to trying to speak about and getting into the revelations chap 5 and the things that was there in the Bible and I hope it's been helpful to you to studying these things and to see what all of these symbols mean because thank God for the sending of the Prophet to where that we could understand the symbol see we questioned this we questioned that but then when God sent us a prophet and told us what these things mean this and then it was so simple until we were stumbling over it looking for some kind of a monster you know or something to come stumbling around and doing all over the Earth and and all I that I never didn't understand how that was going to deceive anybody I could understand how it could step on somebody but not deceive you you know cuz it's not it wouldn't that wouldn't be a religious matter it it needs to be something closer at hand but now what we've been trying to talk about is we're we're actually studying on the revelation of Jesus Christ that's why we've read this in Revelations 1 forever service so far because the entire Bible as we were talking about uh this past Sunday especially the afternoon service trying to get to to a point to see but the entire Bible is the revelation of Jesus Christ because it was to real reveal God made manifest on Earth living with you and I and that would fulfill then Emmanuel that the scripture said you know which means god with us so while he was here on Earth almighty God came down to pay the price now I want you to watch tonight and I'm going to say it and then if I have time I'll get back to it but don't I pick it up Sunday but if you'll notice the the uh in when we're reading in a minute that it's talks of you know um a man to be worthy to take the book well then we know that it said you know we not John because the line of the tribe of Judah we know all about where Jesus came from and we'll get to that in a minute but notice it was calling for a man to come forth and and John saw well you know the Elder was talking about a line well then once that symbol is broken then you can understand that it was the line of the tribe of Judah and that's where the lineage Earthly speaking of where that would come down to Jesus you know and and doing that but what I want you to think about is is what form are you dealing with on Redemption U because we know that 2,000 years ago on earth a man died for our sins and we know he was the kinsman redeemer etc etc you know he paid the price and the baptism of the Holy Ghost kep came on the the the day of Pentecost there all right the new birth into the hearts of the Saints but had you never thought about that why would then would you have to have it written out like you do to come to the Book of Revelations and speaking of that no one was worthy to take the book and to loose the seals thereof well it sounds like that you know if you just read that without comprehension of the end time and the way we understand then you know maybe your mind I know it doesn't work like mine I'm glad it don't but still that's just the way I think but uh because it'd be Mass confusion if we all thought alike especially like me but the point I'm trying to get is that why would you have the Book of Revelations talking about needing a Kinsman I'm letting that Coast a little bit what is the purpose what is the concept or thought or idea of coming over into the Book of Revelations in 2 years after almost the uh birth of the church uh the coming of the day of Pentecost of the new birth Into the Heart of mankind and then John is weak Because unless a lamb can come forth and take the book All Is Lost right I pause I want you to think about that I like to get you to think I I like to get people to think I like you think about what I'm saying you know think or think every how you use them words I'm just I don't have the education to keep up with you do that part but what why would you have to have a redeemer what is the purpose or the idea or the thought maybe there's more into this than we're trying to comprehend because we know for sure Jesus Christ died the writer said he died you know those personal Witnesses said he died they said he rose they said he came back they said he was our kinsman redeemer they said he was our our Advocate our high priest you know I'm quoting the scriptures of Paul and Peter and them you know but why would you need a Kinsman to come forth in the Book of Revelations I won't try to attempt to express any thought on that other than just that thought I leave that with you to think about a while because it may be very interesting when we get on down a little further all right but now we've been studying about the as we read there in Revelations uh 51 you know about the the one sitting on the throne and we know that that's a fulfillment of the fourth chapter because John was taken up to and saw the throne and one sitting on the throne 24 Elders the the different things and then we came over into the fifth chapter and we say that it's a scene it's not a verse by verse more it's a scene it's opening you're beginning to see a picture if you understand um you know God help me to break it down that see chapter 4 is a verse by verse expression of this this this is this but when you come to the fifth chapter it is more or less opening up a scene you're beginning to see in in in Your Vision or thoughts the things that the fourth chapter was speaking of and that's what I've been trying to get you to to line up with maybe I could find words tonight to express those thoughts that you know one is a verse by verse the like I told told you even Paul's writings Peter's writings uh they were writing off something or writing off someone which was the Lord Jesus Christ and then they would speak about him being in US Christ in you to hope of glory but when you coming to the emphasis of the Book of Revelations you're dealing with more dealing into seeing the bride of Christ all right now read chapter 5 with that in mind to where that you can see yourself sitting there and you'll see it's more of a scene then because it uh in other words the the writing of the book is like you would take what you call it script is that the word they use for at script where they they a guy writes a a story you know all right then they make it into a movie and they they bring that down and they give you all of the scripts and the things you know well that's the things you're to read and to see and that's what John was trying to to get us to see through chapter 4 but now in chapter 5 it's entering a scene of reality something is actually taking place in reality all right and it's taking place right here because we're not up there and that's what I was trying to do there Sunday uh wait he and I were talking last night he said Daddy I think you better have questions and answers I said well we we'll have it quick as we can you know and just to see what's on your mind to let's find out what you're thinking I'm doing the best I can to try to bring it down to to the point of revealing you know I can't reveal it because it takes God to do it but we went through the things and we're having to take a verse by verse but what we're doing now is not taking the verse by verse to describe Jesus Christ as much as we're taking a scene of where he's at and what he's doing right and see now we see him more coming related toward the church because you've got the one sitting on the throne same as chapter 4 amen all right but now see in chapter 4 you didn't see necessarily unless you talk about us being the throne and and the things like that which I tried to emphasize but now you see that our Sunday we picked it up that he there was a book in his right hand all right now we know right hand means power and authority it's not somebody sitting over here on the right hand you know cuz that wouldn't even be sensible but it means right hand and Authority because the Bible says we're saved by his right hand you know by his power his authority all right now then we covered how that that Authority is transmitted into you and I cuz he gave the disciples while he was here in Mark 6 verse 7 he gave them power over unclean spirits right and things like that well then we read we didn't have time to express it but we read then or talked on in Revelations 2 and verse 26 to the Overcomer that he have power over all the nations well see that's a promise to the church ages that was a promise to them he gave them power right he gave them power over unclean spirit they could go out cast out Devils heal the sick all kind of things right all right but then when it comes to the church ages see he comes back and restates it to the Overcomer and remember every Overcomer received all of the everything of all of the Overcomers all and he States it there that he would give power over the Nations even you know not only just unclean spirits and things but see knowing that it would have to have the end time would be a whole lot worse than uh natural sicknesses we would come down here in the end time until you would be you would be your spiritual condition feeling with your mind mind of what you're doing all but then to see it we're looking at a scene so we've spent quite a while talking about the right hand you know the the the power and authority and uh we talked about the book that was in the hand of the one sitting on the Drone and tried to show that that was not a book like this because back when that was written in 8 9596 they didn't have books like this they had Scrolls all right we went through the unrolling of the scroll and and the seeing and how you could do that with the you know and have a tab sticking out and that tab would be sticking out and it would say Luke or Matthew or Mark or Isaiah or whatever and then they could just reach and get those Scrolls and they could read it all right but then we tried to make it then bringing it from uh because if you were listening and that's what I'm trying to describe you see those were the scripts those were the writers of the play you know a man writes a book all right and then they put it into a movie all right and a lot of times it's a a book about your your natural you know people's lives you know I mean they put the whole life story into a book form all right but see if you're really doing it I wouldn't want nobody else playing me in a movie right cuz it wouldn't be me right right if it's ever a movie made that I'm in I want to be I want to be the guy in the movie you know why because I I know about myself right cuz you know how they do they they take those things and beef them up and try to make them a whole lot more uh illustrious or what you call it to the eye and the Temptations to hold you and stuff like that all right but the writing of the book I told you then and we covered how that there were only names written in the book that it's speaking of in Revelations only names written in that book because those were the names of the people of God all but then we come to the Earth and we see while these names are being here looking down at Peter see now it writes a story on Earth about what's taking place while Peter is on Earth or Paul or Moses or Jeremiah Ezekiel or whatever and then it was brought down to what we call the Bible see then the Bible is the not only the loue Book of Life bringing the names into being the Bible is also the book of life right which means it covers life right it covers what happened in the days of Moses while Moses was here now had it not been a time of a fall you remember if we get time we'll go back and read these a minute I gave them to you you know back in the time of the of the fall of mankind you know if there hadn't been a fall there wouldn't have been anybody here but the names of those that were the people of God they were written in the in the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world all right but because of the fall of mankind see then other people came into being upon the Earth to make out the story and to make it right and see when when Adam fell then brother R said the book went back to the one uh you know the original owner all right now the book not the Bible section of the entire Bible because had even been written right but the book of names went back that's right to the hand of the original owner and he said and then we see him now here sitting on the throne with that book in his hand well then it's not just Bible up there you know King James version Thompson chains scoffield wh whatever you want to put them out in thousands of different Bible things and and all like that but it's a book of names you got that was all that' be needed God doesn't need to write down all of our doings he said he put our sins into see of his forgetfulness well I'm glad of that amen but he made a record right the record is this Bible this Bible that we've been through it in the church a series especially where the Prophet covers the and and in The Invisible Union where he covers the uh one book with two sections which is The Book of Life and and Judas had his name written in the book of life right mhm CU his name was in this Bible right but his name was not written in the lamb book of life section cuz that's eternal life and see he rejected eternal life yes but a record was made of him to where when it comes to a time of judgment the book can be pulled but who is going to be the book you know that the ones that that was around Judas at the times will be the ones that will stand forth and condem him they won't have to take the Bible and say well okay we got to read over here in Matthew let's see you're found in you know no it's people that's right the book of life eternal section is a book of names that should have come forth that there in Genesis 1 you know where said let us make man in our image and our likeness right he should have come forth there amen but it wasn't able to come forth because of the fall of mankind all right but when the fall came did that stop the book from coming no it put the book back into the hand of the original where it was in other words he had brought it down to were that Adam and Eve was holding within themselves the ability to bring forth the correct understanding and the correct L lineage of people you agree with that they had within them some of you didn't that's all right they had within them Adam and Eve had within them the ability to bring forth right said even Isaiah them should have come through the wound of Eve that's right see now you can't figure that out cuz ain't no need trying to figure it out well how could this have been and how could that have been just just forget it it didn't happen that way we fa because God know we were going to fall but then he started writing a book about us oh yeah and we call it the Bible Genesis Exodus Leviticus Numbers Deuteronomy but you know those were people right and the natural life written behind him you know that in the book of what is it Esther um that even the word God's not even in the Book of Esther that's right that's right because Esther is a basically a genealogy of records of the children of Israel and what happened in a time there that they put it in as a record in record point it's not even the word God is not even used there because it's not dealing with that point it's keeping records a lot of this Bible is records right to so we got so and so and so and we got so and so and so and so we got so and so and you can run their lineages all the way back by following what's written in this book and to see who we came from you go back and study in Matthew uh Matthew 1 it gives the lineage coming down through to David and and Judah and on down and comes down to to where that Christ can come into being because it's a record of life oh yeah all right but see within that also is names cuz that's all that's in the book of the Lamb's Book of Life you know the Eternal section is the book of names but see then you'd write Genesis 1 all right Genesis 1 everything was fine it was only dealing with that one seed singular right but Genesis 2 man was put in flesh right right all right then by putting us in flesh God knew we'd fall you say well I can't help it they done it well if you and I had been back there we'd have done worse and that's no problems no talking no no arguing over a point if you'd have been back there if I'd have been back there we would have done worse probably than what Adam and Eve done that's just plain language but listen then once it was put in Genesis 2 the natural man the flesh man the capability of falling came and man fell and God started riding a record but you know what he was bringing forth fourth that Genesis 1:26 and 27 man it's called in Galatians 3:16 and unto thy seed singular which is Christ amen that's why the the prophet would say if you read the Bible and don't see Christ in every verse he didn't say Jesus because that deals with the human flesh right if you don't see Christ in every verse he said read it again cuz you missed it right see then the entire Bible is the writing about Mankind upon the Earth but the names of those that are the children of God see that was the book in the hand of the one sitting on the throne see then we see him over Revelation 5 with the book all right now he not only just has a book in his hand is what I was trying to get across Sunday see that book that you see we're going to get on over into the chapter a little further to where that were preach in Kings there in chapter 5 but we'll have to deal with some things about why did the book have to be sealed all right looking at it to see what was going on to where that we can understand see then we conclude that it was a book of names all right go ahead and pull up Number Two Brother Anderson I like to give these because a lot of times you think it's my wording and and if my word's right then ain't worried about it anyway you know because it I'd like to hear somebody else's definition of what what happened in the in the beginning and what happened and how the book came about and and how that you can tie it together to see the Book of Revelation and understand because I'm interested in that because that's my name see so what what your Prophet had to say and really it's called The Church age book The sardian Church age page 267 to begin with there is no basis for the claims that the Lamb's Book of Life is not the same as the Book of Life just two sections one book book of life L Book of Life all right now not the same as the Book of Life The Book of Life might be called the Lamb's Book of Life or Christ Book of Life or even thy book and book of the living see that's what the the Bible can be called the loung Book of Life Look only names are written in it and then he gives you the scripture Revelation 138 did everybody that doesn't have their names written in the Lamb's Book of Life Will Worship the Beast or go after the system of organized religion and be parts of that but the true bride will be searching for what she's trying to do see and trying to see if she can find herself see there's only names written then in that Book of Life of the one sitting on the throne but that's you and I that's our names right and our names being there puts us there as well as we're here and you know all right and see it was written before the foundation of the world according to Ephesians 1:4 It Was Written what the lounge Book of Life the eternal life section was written before before the foundation of the world all right then the prophet of God said it was all planned out it was all planned out you see the book actually was planned and written before the foundation of the world this book The Bible was really written pull that one up because lot of times you think that I'm saying book and Bible and things let's just let him say it first SE 1963 318 paragraph 33 33 you see the book Act was planted and written before the foundation of the world this book The Bible was really written before the foundation of the world and Christ being the lamb was slain before the foundation of the world and the members of his bride their names were put in the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world but it's been sealed up now we got to get to something on that all right and now it's being revealed whose names were in there all about it amen I don't mind go ahead and telling you so I write this down your name is sealed in the book that's right we'll quote in just a minute the next one the book is sealed and you're sealed with the book so it's revealing your name you're trying to reveal the Antichrist everybody is about to break into the seals now that goes all the way back 1982 and 83 right brother Gary that I wouldn't trying back then to reveal the Antichrist it was reveal Jesus Christ amen the literal seal itself the man of sin sitting in the temple of God showing himself to be as God will be naturally to Israel the fourth seal is the Armageddon that's in Israel fifth seal is fifth seal Jew six seals tribulation period the literal happening under the sealed is to Israel but see we're sealed in the book is sealed why is it sealed now look what he's calling it it's been sealed and now it's been now it's being revealed whose names were in there all about it what a great thing and John when he saw it he said everything in heaven everything under the Earth everything heard him saying amen and blessings and honor he just really was having a great time for the lamb was worthy now think about it the book's been sealed up drop over to number five brother I get them going back there and I give them numbers to follow by so they can they can uh lower it down just a high paragraph no that's not it paragraph 75 number five run it up to that one you're still on four there you go this is after this is the message the prophet called the breach you know look now notice now this book is sealed and you are sealed with the book what greater thoughts could be brought than that that the book is sealed and we're sealed with the book until the day of redemption that's why I ask you a simple question Sunday afternoon morning one of the two there do you believe redemption's over cu the lamb can't leave the mercy seat right until Redemption is over but the prophet in he's preaching in 63 and that's why everybody thought it it sound just like the lamb left to Mercy Seat in 63 well if it did they been nobody saved since then it's like I said Sunday that lead biggest portion of us out wouldn't it but you see the lamb can't leave The Mercy Seat I don't care how many quotes you got of the Lamb leaving The Mercy Seat be careful the way you're using them because you got to remember the lamb can't leave The Mercy Seat until redemption's over that's right that's why he stays there as a lamb not a lion the lamb is the only one that can take the book The Lion can't take the book right right the lamb is the only one that can take the book because the Redemption is not over until the lamb takes the book and pulls the seal off of it it can't be done see so the book is sealed and you're sealed with the book all right it was actually planned and written before the foundation of the world only names written in the book but it's been sealed up it's been sealed up until the end time what about our names being there you said well they preached about this preached about that yes they have but that's you know you've heard everything in the world on predestination and for knowledges and all like that but see in the end time the book is to be revealed right and you know what most people wants to find is they like to read theirself in here and they like to read it like a love story novel or something because it's not spicy enough to just read their name so they want to read it and spice it up to make it a story why are we always trying to find out what God's got against us instead of trying to find out how much God thinks of us am I right yes we rethinking about what we've done wrong isn't that most of our point we we read about what we've done wrong well I was reading there the other day and I seen how wrong I was that's good that's all right that needs to be done that's wonderful but how about reading sometimes to find out what God thinks about you that's right amen that's it well don't you think we ought to repent of for sins yeah but we don't we not his children that's right you're standing in a day and a time now when the children are proven that they don't believe their mother and daddy is their mother and Daddy because they're willing to face them slap them knock them down kill them mhm they don't want them to rule over them right we was raised up in a time when we honored our fathers and our mothers we cherished them for bringing us into the world now the children you brought me into the world you got to take care of me right I mean am I going wrong no but it shows that we're not in wanting to find out who we are we're only wanting to find out if the Bible tells we've done this we done done that we done this we got rid of this we got this you know like I told you the man said said I read them seals I found myself as that white horse rider he said then I become the red horse rider then I become the black horse rider then I become the Pale Horse I said yep youve lost the whole time because every bit of that Theon Beast no redeemable there you can't redeem them beasts like that the Theon that's right is only the zoom Beast can be redeemed would be your for combat Beast that we speak of and we went to Ezekiel and things with it but are you listening see then there's only names in the book and that was the book that went back your record is not been made of your life the record of the children of Israel the record of the sin of mankind and all of that was not made until after the fall that's right then God started keeping the record writing down about what we done and if you'll notice see Moses is Welling over but he's the one that writes Genesis but TimeWise he's over quite a while in the Bible before I didn't look it up to actually tell you but he's on over a pretty good piece in the Bible before he even writes what God said about what had happened in Genesis right right mhm you you understand what I mean by that the fall had come man had come down and great things had happen floods had happen all kind of things that taken place and then Moses appears on the scene then he writes what went on back there cuz that's what took him God took him up on the mountain and showed him how to write this book how to bring down a record and how to do the things that's why your Prophet was so wonderful when I seen what he was saying we read read The Ten Commandments and it said Thou shalt not kill Thou shalt not steal Thou shalt not commit adultery and we think that's a book of rules but if you'll think of it in a different way Brother Gary was talking about it years ago you know the few times he did try to preach quit he at least had enough sense to quit but if you read it different see instead of Thou shalt not kill if you read it Thou shalt not kill Thou shalt not steal if you're truth honest in heart you won't steal you won't kill then brother random comes along and he said they didn't get what they thought they got when they got the Ten Commandments that's right they wanted to book of rules to tell them how good they were and what to do they got a revelation of Jesus Christ written in the seals The Ten Commandments Prophet we call the Ten Commandments to see if would have any trouble with it why because it's the entire Bible what is sealed up what has been sealed up now listen to what I'm talking about you get it what Moses done was written in this book right now was that sealed up no it's written right you see if Abraham lied all kind of things about it gave his wife away two times right right that's not sealed anybody with a third grade education or what whatever can read the Bible the words off the page true right so what is sealed you remember we read through Jeremiah that when they were going into bondage when they were to go down into bondage see then they would take and they would take all of those records of who own what property you know this property belongs to this to where they would know when they got back to get everything straight and they would take that and they would bury them in Earthly vessels underground to preserve them right and see then when they came back they could say well you own this and you own this and you own this well because they had the Deeds that would be what you call an abstract title deed and in doing that there was a record made about those things sealed up in an Earthly vessel right see Jesus Christ was that Earthly vessel that God was sealed up in that's right amen you remember that Sunday he didn't think about it church we can read what Moses done we can read what Ezekiel done Jeremiah done but there was a mystery that was sealed up all of that time and not even to be made known even to the disciples in its fullness but to be made known in the end time see if you took out all of the things that's written about what we've done and do you wouldn't have but just a book of names and that would be the children of God but you see it has to write that what happened to us like Paul would say you know he would talk about the the world and the things and he would say and such were some of you right think that's the record kept in the book but said now you're clean right why because then we can see Jesus Christ came on the scene and took away our sins amen and then he would be the Fulfillment of of the Book of Ruth read it sometime we get a chance of Naomi and Ruth and and all Naomi was a Jew and she went down she left the land and went away trying to make a living her husband died her sons died and you know they start back home and Ruth goes with her well when it got back to there the kinsman redeemer had a right to redeem right read the book of Ruth sometimes and just think about it in right to the kinsman redeemer had to be somebody kin folk and the also had to be capable there were certain things went with it it wouldn't just a fact you can say well let old sorry SLO no you had to be capable of being able to to be your Kinsman if you remember the story to show you how we were lost and in the world of sin you remember the story in the Book of Ruth that Naomi you know Boaz wouldn't wouldn't too interesting get Naomi right she was an old woman and done P his childbearing so he wasn't going to have to do no work of brothers or whatever it would be and he didn't have to be concerned with none of those things to carry on a lineage he wanted Ruth and Ruth was a gentile but there that stuned you he wanted to he wanted that beautiful Ruth for his wife but remember Boaz told Naomi Ruth there's one closer to Ken we've got to give him the first opportunity and if he buys Naomi Ruth goes with it so Boaz had to do the Kinsman work he had to wait on the man you had to give him an opportunity he told him he said redeem your right of Naomi and her inheritance the man says read the book of there he said I will redeem Bo said but there's one thing that you got to do if you take Naomi and her property you got to take Ruth and bear up children right right so the man was a good sta Jew in the natural so he didn't want to infiltrate his lineage with a gentile so he told Boaz he said I refuse the right to redeem the homie you do it that's right he boy has knew what he's doing and the only way he could get him to ever turn that down because he done said I'll take it that's right now you know what that is we come here K folks to the devil that's right whether you like it or not the devil is the one we came kin folks to because of the fall but see he couldn't redeem us cuz he was the devil but Jesus Christ came to pay the price that's right and he became our kinsman redeemer by becoming human flesh God himself had to come down not send a son we don't believe in trinitarian doctrines tonight we believe in one true and living Goden see would you send one of your children to die or would you go yourself right other words somebody said we're going to kill somebody you said well okay son I'm sorry you got to go you no no if we're any father at all we go oursel right that's right and see God didn't send send a son down that's what we think about in the trinitarian God sent his son we don't believe in that we don't believe in Eternal sunship right we believe in Eternal God Amen so God came himself down in human flesh yes sir in other words he took human flesh that soul and that Spirit within that body was almighty God but that body was a human element that Hebrews uh 10:5 says a body thou H has prepared for me he made a human body and came to Earth and when then that would be would be the kinsman redeemer cuz that would be the only way the price could be paid would be that kinsman redeemer come and stand in our place righten and he paid the price then when he paid the price he raised from the dead sent back on the day of Pentecost to baptism of the Holy Ghost amen Amen to give us an abstract time of deed other words gave us eternal life right in our soul body and spirit we're still human Mortals but the soul of mankind is where the new birth starts he gave us that Abstract title deed but we didn't know how to call it that see we didn't know to call it abstract and things those are words of this day right huh but you see he paid price that's right right amen he redeemed us you believe it amen amen now go back and ask that question again then if he redeemed us why are we in the Book of Revelation trying to find a redeemer are you thinking or you sleep why we got why have we got to come back in this end time to think about a kinsman redeemer when we know who paid the price we know who become kin folks to us now we're looking for a Kinsman to come and take the book because in the book is the whole Plan of Redemption the names all of the names all of the doing listen folks surely don't get in your mind they're out there somewhere listening that I'm talking about some kind of a something that didn't that wasn't worthy enough back there that the price wasn't paid back there it was that's right Jesus Christ paid the price he became our Kinsman we become join ours as I trying to bring out suay the Bible says amen join ours with Christ that's why he said all power in Heaven and Earth is given unto me then he turn around and gives that power to the church that's right in my name you'll cast out Devils you gave the power to the church chur he paid the price he was the Kinsman right but see where the problem was is what I tried to preach to you back about two months ago when a prophet preached a message one day saying raising Jesus from history you know if we're sitting here tonight with a historical God sure he paid the price but how do we know he's our Kinsman how do we know the price has been paid well I feel it in my heart we listening last night where brother Bram was talking about the Muhammad and the man talking to the Muhammad and you know and saying well uh your Muhammad religion is no good why don't you accept Jesus Christ and the Muhammad and said show me one thing that your Jesus Christ can do any more than Muhammad can do for me he said Mohammad said said Jesus promised us life after death he said Muhammad did too you remember the story right but even the Mohamad turned around and said m mammad didn't tell us that we' do the things that he done but said your god did said now let's see him done and I'll accept it right so do we know about what it is a Redemption what would be the problem would we look would we be looking for another Redeemer to come no that's stupidity but I asked you a simple question at the end of the message Sunday afternoon I said will your faith produce a lamb for you will your faith produce a lamb for you well God's already produced it amen but can we depend upon what he's done well sure we can we believe in him well why don't we live like that's right right that's right but after 2,000 years John is weeping for the Kinsmen to come and John was there when the Kinsman was here the first time right right M he ate with him slept with him saw him die saw him raised experienced a new birth on the day of Pentecost to prove that he was that God to prove he was the Kinsman but then why are you looking for a kman but now we know they were we know All Is Lost Without that Kinsman coming right see then if we can't see the Throne of Revelation 4 and the one sitting on the throne and see what that means see that it means in your heart in your life is God sitting on the Throne of your life that's right ruing land in your heart that's right amen if we can't see that we're crying for a redeemer why after all that the prophet has said all that we spent of the 40 something years of studying the message why is it that most people still looking for a redeemer looking for somebody that can come and take us out of here then they got all kind of doctrines that run out from that right trying to find a Kinsman you got the people believing in certain people being God because they believ they were the ones to come and take over after the prophet left why is the people of this message still looking for a redeemer well brother de what are you looking for I'm looking for that one to be able to fulfill Revelations 4 and climb up on the throne in my heart and sat down that's right on this Earthly Throne that he had has here upon Earth which is a very poor excuse and only then can I realize a scene can open in heaven that I can see a book and find out that that book has got my name in it and I preached to you there at Sunday it's not Samuel Dale it's not that that's not your name in the book right that's your Earthly name that Mom and Daddy gave you MH see that's why Paul had to his name was Saul and his name when he got converted had to be changed and made him to Paul Peter was fine means cus but it had to be changed to Peter Jacob's name had to be changed to Israel you remember that in the Bible right are you listening are we still looking for a Kinsman to come or do we know where the Kinsman is see if you can see that Kinsman on the throne in your heart then you can realize Brother Gary that we are that book right we're not looking for a Kinsman to come and take the the book as to pay the price now maybe you'll catch on and see the Kinsman I'm talking about the end time is not the one to pay the price Jesus Christ paid the price right right he was our Kinsman that paid the price MH Boaz could pay the price and redeem Naomi but that wasn't all the story cu the rest of the story was him to receive Ruth as a wife and by children amen and that first child that went back to Naomi remember to carry her leading of her family on read the book of Ruth see Jesus Christ paid the price 2,000 years ago our Kinsman paid the price that's right but he hasn't taken possession yet the price is paid church right mhm but can we accept it that's right oh yeah we believe he can save us you know he he can save us and he can do this but do we put it all in him and say the price had already paid John wouldn't looking for a Kinsman like that way he was looking for a Kinsman that could take the book and loose the seal not to be able to pay the price of Redemption come on try that down and think on it a little John knew Jesus Christ paid the price he' experienced it in his own heart man that's right he was looking for a lamb or a line looking for a man is what his where starts out in Revelations 5 we'll get to it Sunday he was looking for a man to come and take the book he knew an animal couldn't do it it was no form of talking about animal but when the elders said the lon of the tribe of Judah has prevailed he could take the book and loose the seals come on loosen the seals is to take the seal off the book it's not the writing of the book the book is written you and I are the right the words that are in the book you can read it to be personal just like going back there to where it says that when the in the end time say when the towers fall right see we seen them fall two our Flames took them down didn't it they found a scroll in the Bible one time and they stood before the water gate and read the scroll this prophet's message was beginning to be preached when you had a water gate and our day that's right and you lost a president on account of it see the Bible it tells you right where you're at because it's a secret mystery within the book that we're trying to find not a not of what how we're guilty of this we're guilty of that we know we're all guilty John I don't believe was trying to find somebody to pay the price he knew the price had been paid amen but he needed a revelation to where that that something about this book in the hand of the one sitting on the throne he knew who that was right but he couldn't comprehend that book he knew that that one on the throne was Jesus Christ that's right you remember he heard his voice in chapter 4 it was the same voice that he heard while he was on Earth walking with him that voice called him up chapter 4 he knew that throne and the symbols and the things but he couldn't understand that book in the hand of the one sitting on the throne and why a proclamation would go out through heaven for somebody some man to be able to come and take the book no man was worthy brother R said there was no way he said Moses was there look at that that Elijah was standing there Moses was there listen how straight he makes it all the apostles were standing there of all of the ones that had died look how personally he straight how he keeps it all the holy men job the sages everyone was standing there but nobody was worthy even to look at the book let alone to take it and break the seals see the Plan of Redemption was sealed up in Jesus Christ if we don't see him correctly we may go by the grave yes that's fine CU that's what mankind is done down through time because they found no way for anybody to be able to take the book and loose the seals we're not dealing with the paying the price the price was paid in Jesus Christ he is our Kinsman amen but to see how that Kinsman can come and take you and me take these old Mortal bodies that we're living in and change them right make us into like his own glorious body salvation as far as the understanding of the soul and the new birth was made known to the disciples written in the writings of Christ in you the hope of glory but they can only prophesy of a future event Paul could only say one day you be Chang on the twinkle of an eye this Mortal put on immortality Etc but see they couldn't cover that part because it was sealed you see what I'm driving there the k man Redeemer that you and I need in the end time is the one that can take the book and loose the sealed off and show the Redemption of these bodies and souls I mean body and spirit of mankind amen we know who paid the price right we know it was in Jesus Christ we preached that but we need to see us taken off ourselves that's right mhm yes sir we read what the prophet said he said the book is sealed and you're sealed with the book you know that we are the Believers in the book that's what we are is what you say well I I can't find myself to read Revelations come on how many times have I've been over that you can't find yourself in the reading of the book anywhere just turn over to chapter one of the book of of Revelation and start reading and you'll never find Jesus there by himself he's revealing himself to his bride or in his bride the book of redemption has been opened see it was planned and written in all of the things but what about it as I said about Ruth and Boaz then Boaz was a type of Christ he paid the price but then he got Ruth paying the price Jesus Christ paid our priz 2,000 years ago I'm not talking about getting somebody to climb up on a cross and dying again I'm pointing back to what happened there but yet when he left that part there there was something sealed up it was sealed up until mankind didn't understand it here in the end time that's coming forth that we can see that we're the book we're the book in the hand of the one sitting on the throne now he can reveal you and I Christ The Mystery of God revealed I thank his PA 74 said the bride is part of the mystery you know what she's got to be revealed amen that's right be careful now brother D you make too much out of yourself I'm not trying to make my too much out of myself I'm trying to make something out of you I'm not concerned about my end of the deal I'm concerned with trying to get you to see who you areen and see that you are The Offspring of God and he's taking the the seals off of you right think on these things come on Brothers understand kinsman redeemer what are you looking for I hope you understood my whole point I'll say it one more time the kinsman redeemer I'm talking about is Jesus Christ and he came and paid the price 2,000 years ago right but he didn't claim the property of all of us at that time he didn't claim the body he claimed only the soul in possession because that's where he went on the day of Pentecost was right down into the soul of mankind now he's here to pay the price and the paying of the price is not of trying to find another Kinsman but to see what he done he walked into immortality to where no man has approached unto that's what your Bible says that Jesus Christ went to word no man no no wonder no no wonder was it when the prophet went beyond the curtain of time he said I want to see Jesus he said he's in a higher Dimension you can't go there right he went as far as he could go but he couldn't go to the seventh Dimension why because the Bible it said no man has approached to immortality with Jesus Christ immortality is mortal flesh made Eternal the and when you say Mortal is this then when you say immortality it means this is made Eternal see then that's what we're not looking for a new body looking for this body to be redeemed Jesus Christ stood there after his resurrection in the Eternal condition and said fill my hands that's right right you see we've been taught all of our life we're going to get a new body why is it that we don't believe God can redeem this one do we think this one is too bad Resurrection is not replacement I Dro this Bible and pick up a book that's not it I got to pick the same thing back up same thing that went down came up it proved it Jesus did see then why are we worried about anything let's get into the book of redemption to see ourselves in that book what we got 97 in the uh R the world will try any might have a you may Ser the world your you never brother standing for somebody you to work with and they got a little babies brother's heart they're going to operate on Jesus let believe when they going to operate operate let just believe that all is well right father you heard our brother he hasn't concern about so that we lord have a little one touch our heart just reach down baby let let the doctors perform their operation we know you can do it without even being if you choose that way all things well believe you anybody else not looking for another Jesus to come not looking for another Redeemer but to see what he's done and see what he's still doing all the world you CH she's here for her mother breus you believe see the price is paid but you ain't claimed it yet this is in the end time of where he claiming The Possession when he gave you that baptism of the Holy Ghost he L claim on that oh one day this body then is going to have to be made the Bible said we have a body like under his own glorious body he would here he the wall s down what a wonderful time to be able to understand the plan of Ric sweet love and one more time before we go anybody have a oh Jesus father Friday for we
