[16:26] all right all mine's clear everything
[16:28] good
[16:29] all right it's a stunt of Man part 108
[16:34] we're gonna look at a different angle
[16:36] here in just a minute and maybe not
[16:39] change your thought but but help you to
[16:41] think about godliness and not just to be
[16:44] so pure that we we walk around like like
[16:47] God zombies
[16:49] you know no we're not God zombies we're
[16:51] humans
[16:52] but we do have godliness living inside
[16:54] of us so there's somewhere this thing's
[16:56] got to meld together
[16:58] all right we live as humans
[17:01] born and sin shape and iniquity have a
[17:03] carnal mind
[17:04] all right but we're trying to head
[17:06] toward the mind of Christ which is pure
[17:07] and holy and is godliness well if it's
[17:10] required then there's something we got
[17:12] to do that'll get us to that all right
[17:14] so we're going to see that here in just
[17:16] a few minutes so let's bow our heads
[17:19] Lord Jesus thank you for this evening
[17:21] you've given us a meal of the week pray
[17:23] this should be with us now and
[17:24] sanctifies Lord
[17:26] open this up Lord open our heart to you
[17:28] Lord that we'll hear from you father and
[17:31] Lord I pray if there be any sick among
[17:32] us Lord that you'll heal them Father I
[17:35] know there are several that are at home
[17:36] that are sick Lord and several that are
[17:38] not with us it's Rebecca and sister Anna
[17:40] Lord different ones it's traveled to be
[17:42] with loved ones that are not that are
[17:44] not well father I pray that your healing
[17:46] hand would be upon them Lord
[17:48] touch us here now today Lord give us
[17:51] Revelation because that's what we thrive
[17:53] on that's what we live on just as the
[17:54] manna that fell in the wilderness Lord
[17:57] let the Manna fall today father that
[18:00] we'll get something from you Lord and
[18:01] we'll be able to eat it and let it
[18:04] sustain us Lord
[18:05] till we meet again father just bless us
[18:08] now in Jesus name amen you'll be seated
[18:11] so we've been talking about the
[18:14] godliness and then we're going to head
[18:16] toward brotherly kindness but let's read
[18:19] the scripture here in the beginning was
[18:20] the word where it was with God and the
[18:21] Word was God and the Word was made flesh
[18:24] that's what we're heading toward only in
[18:26] this end time as we were kind of trying
[18:28] to to show our brothers and sisters this
[18:31] past weekend that it's not just going to
[18:33] take it's not just going to take average
[18:35] reading it's not going to take average
[18:37] to get us out of here
[18:40] average will not get us out of here
[18:42] average sustained us through the church
[18:45] ages average will get you into heaven
[18:49] Maybe
[18:51] Maybe
[18:52] but exceptional is what we're required
[18:55] now we're required to live a Godly life
[18:58] that's what we're going to talk about
[19:00] here in just a minute
[19:02] and something kind of struck me
[19:04] yesterday
[19:05] no day before yesterday someone said it
[19:07] work and it's uh you know you you always
[19:11] you you never ever ever do you have a
[19:14] conversation with somebody about
[19:15] religion
[19:16] and they don't say well I ain't perfect
[19:18] you ain't perfect
[19:21] because you start you start digging into
[19:23] that you know living a little bit higher
[19:25] life and they're like no no and you know
[19:28] I the Lord don't matter if it don't
[19:30] matter the Lord if I say that bad word
[19:34] and I even asked I said would you say
[19:35] that in front of your pastor and she
[19:37] said well if that's the only thing I
[19:39] said bad yeah she said I probably would
[19:40] say it I said well okay all right so you
[19:42] see that's the mentality of the world
[19:43] mentality of the world is Satan has
[19:45] beaten them down so much
[19:47] so there's no way to come to Perfection
[19:49] no way
[19:50] there's no way to get there your
[19:52] denomination has just got you sitting
[19:54] somewhere and you're what divided that's
[19:57] what denomination means they divide you
[19:59] up
[20:00] but we're going to be the word made
[20:02] flesh Jesus was not
[20:04] uh um I was watching the guy yesterday
[20:07] on YouTube his last name's Peters or
[20:10] Peterson and he's all crippled up with
[20:12] arthritis but man he went through that
[20:14] book of God's generals and he just
[20:16] berated every one of them said that all
[20:18] that charismatic movement was false all
[20:20] that was false and the Holy Ghost he had
[20:22] inside of him knew it was false I
[20:25] thought man come on
[20:27] I mean come on
[20:29] I mean what holy we've got three or four
[20:31] different Holy Ghost because the first
[20:33] thing he'd say he said oh they don't
[20:35] believe in the Trinity oh they don't
[20:36] believe he talked about William Branham
[20:38] oh he don't first thing he just doesn't
[20:40] believe in the Trinity and said we've
[20:41] excluded him called him a charlatan
[20:44] called him you know some of them he
[20:46] called they were just wanted money the
[20:48] different things but I thought ma'am
[20:50] I would not be sitting where you're
[20:52] sitting
[20:54] no I didn't understand it I just said I
[20:56] don't understand
[20:58] even today we can say well we don't
[21:01] understand that but we've come to a
[21:03] place to where we have to understand
[21:04] we've got to come to it's a requirement
[21:06] that when we get our diploma to get out
[21:09] of here when we have our when we have
[21:11] our deed in hand what do we have
[21:16] we have the title deed now back where it
[21:18] should be
[21:20] now you have eternal life but that's not
[21:23] all the title deed was yours
[21:26] the title deed was it your flesh was
[21:29] going to be made word and your word was
[21:31] going to be made flesh now is the word
[21:33] Eternal absolutely the word of God is
[21:36] eternal man's words will fall man's
[21:39] words will go away there'll be Millions
[21:41] upon Millions upon millions of volumes
[21:44] of especially that guy that wrote you'll
[21:46] never not hear about that in glory
[21:48] you'll never hear about that you know
[21:49] you won't need a Webster's Dictionary
[21:51] but there's a time where you need all
[21:53] these things
[21:55] but then there'll be a time when they
[21:56] won't be you don't need that
[21:58] all right so second Peter 1 verse 5 says
[22:01] besides this giving all diligence add to
[22:03] your faith virtue virtue knowledge
[22:05] knowledge Temperance Temperance patience
[22:07] patience godliness that's where we're
[22:09] coming to Godliness brotherly kindness
[22:12] and the brotherly kindness charity and
[22:14] we told you the last time we spoke that
[22:16] when we get to that charity
[22:18] there is a gap in there there is
[22:21] something there there something takes
[22:22] place and we'll get into it maybe Sunday
[22:25] we'll get into that part of an interval
[22:29] because we're all humans I mean like
[22:31] today man I worked in the Garden today
[22:33] for for half a day I took a day off
[22:35] because they pull some more teeth
[22:37] yesterday before yesterday
[22:39] and I'll be lisp and spit but I'll be
[22:41] all right
[22:43] but I worked in the garden all day
[22:45] and and went home and I was tired I was
[22:48] dragging the wagon was dragging
[22:50] but after about an hour of of coming in
[22:53] sitting down drinking some water uh June
[22:56] fixed some wonderful supper and well
[22:57] Gary Krantz is not here but he gave us
[22:59] some uh meatballs and they were good so
[23:03] praise the Lord for that
[23:05] but I was rejuvenated then
[23:08] so there was an interval between me
[23:11] working hard
[23:12] there was an interval where I just took
[23:14] it easy kept eating I mean there was
[23:16] something I did it wasn't I just sat
[23:18] there and didn't do anything and then
[23:20] now we're at church
[23:22] so that's the way we need to look at it
[23:24] in the gospel there's there's seven
[23:25] Church ages and and it's like you know
[23:27] it's like Bam Bam Bam Bam like brother
[23:29] Brown said it talks about the uh the
[23:31] Roman Candle well there's going to be a
[23:33] time where there's going to be like a
[23:34] pause
[23:36] for everything to catch up
[23:38] and we better catch up or I'll promise
[23:41] you at that moment is when God's going
[23:43] to shut the door to the ark
[23:45] all right so don't get left behind
[23:50] First Timothy 3 16 says without
[23:52] controversy
[23:54] great is this mystery of godliness
[23:57] great is this mystery of godliness
[24:00] God was manifested in the flesh
[24:02] justifying the spirit scene of angels
[24:04] preached unto the Gentiles believed on
[24:05] the world received up into the into
[24:07] Glory now what do we see we see that
[24:10] same man back down here
[24:11] we see him in the true baptism of the
[24:14] Holy Ghost that we're going to see when
[24:16] it says holy spirit up here it's not
[24:18] that the First Holy Ghost is false it's
[24:21] just when we come to as as Revelations 3
[24:24] 14 says the faithful and true witness he
[24:27] wasn't a false one he never was a false
[24:30] witness
[24:31] but what reason what brother Brown says
[24:33] about that he explains true being like
[24:35] you tuning for is true it it sounds
[24:38] right everything's the way it's supposed
[24:39] to be and and as we're talking about
[24:41] godliness with contentment we come to
[24:43] that place where
[24:47] the struggle is about to be over folks
[24:52] without controversy great is the mystery
[24:54] of godliness God is Manifest In the
[24:56] Flesh justified in the spirit saint of
[24:58] angels preaching the Gentiles believed
[25:00] on in the world received up into Glory
[25:03] that great mystery without controversy
[25:06] if anything has a controversy there's a
[25:08] dispute
[25:09] there's a doctrinal issue now you've got
[25:12] the Methodist Church buddy they split
[25:13] now I mean they're splitting like crazy
[25:16] and they're they're abandoning churches
[25:17] and abandoning won't let people in
[25:19] certain churches and and that's not
[25:22] contentment
[25:23] but you and I got to learn to be content
[25:25] while that's going on
[25:27] right we gotta learn to be content while
[25:29] that's going on in the message
[25:32] ah
[25:33] so that means we got to move up we've
[25:35] got to be a little more scholarly
[25:38] all right
[25:39] so we know we talked we've been talking
[25:41] about the Plan of Redemption
[25:43] Romans 8 verse 29 said for whom he did
[25:45] for no he also did predestinate so look
[25:49] at simply one more time he saw this he
[25:53] saw that he would lay the plan out
[25:56] God himself
[25:58] just just put the plan out it's not
[26:02] going to change
[26:03] or God changed so it's not going to
[26:06] change so as he threw it out brother Bob
[26:07] he threw it out with us in it
[26:10] not us coming to it
[26:13] I'm kind of quiet tonight
[26:15] he came he came with us with with
[26:17] remember we were in him so we were in
[26:20] the plan we were not something he
[26:22] thought of and then he thought of the
[26:24] plan
[26:25] as the plan unfolded as the Bible says
[26:28] we read it Sunday the Bible says in
[26:30] continuance was I fashioned into lower
[26:34] parts of the Earth in other words in
[26:36] your mother's womb
[26:38] come on somebody that's where you were
[26:40] curiously Rock You Were what you there
[26:44] was no way
[26:46] now when we grew up you didn't even know
[26:49] the sex of the child until the baby came
[26:51] right
[26:52] he used to go to he used to go to baby
[26:54] showers and there was a lot of yellow
[26:56] there
[26:58] for some of you younger ones you're
[27:00] going what in the world no we didn't
[27:02] know the sex of the baby so it was
[27:03] either you got something pink or blue or
[27:05] they'd have to take it back so you got
[27:06] something yellow in there right Mom you
[27:08] got something yellow because yellow
[27:10] stood for both
[27:11] but that's that didn't see now look as
[27:14] we progress in the end time you and I
[27:18] can see
[27:19] who the baby is
[27:21] what the baby is here for
[27:23] we go back the foreknowledge of God he
[27:25] foreign you and he what he he planned
[27:28] according to what he already saw
[27:31] not what surprised him
[27:35] right I believe the devil can't see so
[27:37] much by foreknowledge because a lot of
[27:39] this stuff surprises him
[27:41] I believe that I just I and so see that
[27:44] puts us in a position to where we we
[27:48] look at the Devil and we think well now
[27:50] if we look at the pecking order
[27:54] we think it's God
[27:55] the devil or Lucifer because that's the
[27:58] way the creation part came when he said
[28:00] when he created Lucifer and then the
[28:03] Genesis 1 26 man folks that Genesis 1 26
[28:06] man was already in eternity before Satan
[28:09] was made because you got to remember one
[28:11] thing Satan was not in eternity
[28:15] if he was he's an eternal being
[28:18] so so he was not he had a beginning
[28:21] and he's going to have an ending
[28:23] you and I that Genesis 1 26 man we did
[28:27] not have a beginning and we're not going
[28:29] to have an end if you can connect to
[28:31] that
[28:34] that's where you were
[28:35] before the foundation of the world
[28:38] and then the Bible tells us that we were
[28:40] curiously wrought in the lowest parts of
[28:42] the Earth in other words your parents
[28:44] got together and and didn't have a clue
[28:46] what you had looked like didn't have a
[28:48] clue if you would grow up and be a
[28:49] preacher didn't have a clue if you grow
[28:50] up and be anything
[28:53] but that's not the way God works God
[28:55] knew as we grow up what are you saying
[28:57] by the way he know he knows when we come
[29:00] up to a certain point we're growing
[29:01] we're growing and then we may have an
[29:03] issue
[29:04] we may have a problem in our life well
[29:07] he knew that already by Foreign
[29:08] knowledge so he can predetermine
[29:10] something to help you thank God for that
[29:14] predetermine something to help you bro
[29:16] John once you get there
[29:18] it's that matching pieces
[29:21] there's a piece fell off in the Garden
[29:24] of Eden
[29:25] hey man but remember it didn't get lost
[29:30] he didn't get annihilated
[29:33] brother Brown said I love what he said
[29:35] he said God just took the book back
[29:37] put it on tucked his under his arm in
[29:39] other words I don't know if that's a
[29:40] direct quote but I believe God just took
[29:42] the book and he said okay I'm going to
[29:45] hang on to this because I'm a savior I'm
[29:47] a Healer I'm a redeemer
[29:49] and in this book I got people that I got
[29:51] to save because I already saw
[29:54] already strong before the foundation of
[29:55] the world to be conformed to what the
[29:58] image of his son to be conformed to him
[30:00] now Genesis 1 26 man never changed it
[30:03] never will change
[30:05] it can't change
[30:07] it won't be created in His image and
[30:09] then all of a sudden created in the
[30:10] devil's image or an image of a dog or a
[30:12] cat no it was always created in God's
[30:15] image the real you the Genesis 1 26 man
[30:18] the one that's supposed to be that Holy
[30:21] Ghost as that brother said that Holy
[30:23] Ghost that leads you and guide you into
[30:25] all truth I believe that right amen and
[30:28] I don't believe see he he's looking at
[30:29] it as a third person of Trinity
[30:34] I'm looking at as God himself
[30:36] the throne man in other words
[30:39] not getting down to a secretary and
[30:41] getting down to treasuring and getting
[30:43] down to this and get no God had his hand
[30:45] in all this he has a title though he
[30:48] goes by those titles and he was we were
[30:51] made in the image of his son
[30:52] that he might be the firstborn among
[30:55] many brethren
[30:57] moreover whom he did what predestinate
[31:00] he called
[31:02] all right he saw it
[31:04] saw what we would come to saw as this
[31:06] thing unfolded that that that Boyd would
[31:09] be here in 2023 and and you know brother
[31:12] Howe would be where he's at in a
[31:14] situation of all those everybody's
[31:16] situation never ever slipped up on God
[31:20] so now if he sees it though brother
[31:22] Aaron if he sees it he looks into our
[31:24] Humanity because we're not infinite yet
[31:28] we are finite
[31:30] trying to look at an infinite God but
[31:33] God's infinite looking at us going I
[31:35] knew you were going to get into that
[31:36] situation here's something to help you
[31:38] if you'll take it that's where that's
[31:41] where I see a plan that's where I see
[31:43] that you do have a choice
[31:46] it's the choice you make
[31:50] and God you've already made that choice
[31:54] you just don't know it
[31:56] that's why I love that scripture the
[31:58] Bible says all things will be made new
[32:00] will not have to we won't listen until
[32:03] the disappointments the trials that
[32:05] brother Howe went through the trials
[32:07] that all of us have went through in our
[32:08] life
[32:10] that's what bombards our brain now right
[32:13] right
[32:15] not anymore
[32:17] because we're going to go back to that
[32:18] Genesis 1 26 thinking
[32:21] to where that didn't happen
[32:24] that's what we're going to look at folks
[32:26] this is not so
[32:28] this is not the way it should have
[32:30] happened it says not the way God
[32:32] wanted to see it
[32:34] but to be God and a free and to give you
[32:37] free moral agency had to let you do what
[32:39] you do
[32:41] because listen you never can take away
[32:43] his judgeship
[32:45] he is a righteous judge he's not just a
[32:48] judge I was thinking about today
[32:50] you know if you look in the paper or you
[32:53] look
[32:54] um you look on online and you see the
[32:56] that there was a a judge that that
[32:59] sentenced somebody to to prison and he
[33:02] wasn't guilty
[33:03] that's not a righteous judge now I'm
[33:06] sure he was going by whatever they gave
[33:07] him but somebody lied in there somewhere
[33:11] somebody told a lie to get to that point
[33:13] but with God being the judge he can't
[33:16] lie praise the Lord he can't lie so his
[33:19] judgment can't be changed and it's
[33:21] always going to be true
[33:24] so moreover whom he did predestinate let
[33:26] me also called whom he called he
[33:28] justified
[33:31] as I said before
[33:33] this weekend
[33:35] try to help the people
[33:38] see that we are special
[33:40] that we know we did something wrong we
[33:42] know we got in a pawn shop we know we
[33:45] got into in front of the judge we know
[33:47] we did something wrong
[33:50] we know that
[33:53] four
[33:56] you walk into the courtroom I know some
[33:59] of you may I have to I've been in one
[34:01] time in my life so I don't know but some
[34:03] of y'all may have been more I don't like
[34:04] them frequent flyer miles in the judge I
[34:06] don't want to know the judge by name
[34:08] unless he's a friend of mine
[34:10] okay I don't want to know Josh knew all
[34:13] them yeah Josh well he's throwing it
[34:15] away now but Josh knew everybody up
[34:16] there
[34:18] when you frequent a place you get to
[34:19] know the people
[34:24] but you've done something wrong and you
[34:26] you feel unjust
[34:29] everybody with me this is where we're
[34:30] going to head toward glorification
[34:32] if you feel unjust
[34:34] you feel dirty
[34:36] you know you did it
[34:38] you made a boo-boo all right
[34:41] but you walk into this court
[34:45] and there says the man you know
[34:48] as Jesus Christ sitting as a judge with
[34:50] his white wig on
[34:52] hmm
[34:53] you look over in that same man standing
[34:56] over here
[34:57] the prosecutor
[35:00] and that same man is set standing over
[35:03] here the defense attorney
[35:06] and you look on the judge and you see 12
[35:08] people now all Jesus Christ
[35:11] how'd that make you feel
[35:13] that make you feel wonderful
[35:16] but you know why because he knew we'd
[35:18] make a mistake he knew we would do wrong
[35:21] and he's going to justify us and glorify
[35:24] us not by his own will but he knew what
[35:27] we would do when we walked into that uh
[35:31] courtroom
[35:33] we wouldn't be arrogant we wouldn't be
[35:35] we'll bless God you know I got all this
[35:37] I know all these people so I'm no you
[35:39] come in with wanting some grapes you
[35:41] come in wanting I want Justice
[35:45] man there's so much Injustice in this
[35:47] world I want justice so they so I can go
[35:51] now into the Bible and look at me being
[35:54] uh as we're going to talk in a minute
[35:56] about life and godliness Even in our
[35:58] life
[36:00] we can live a righteous life
[36:03] cause we know how
[36:06] am I with me
[36:09] I know it's Wednesday night don't fall
[36:11] asleep
[36:13] come on
[36:16] so brother Brown tells us that you're on
[36:18] the basis of free moral agency you can
[36:20] turn this down and you can accept it
[36:23] you know what you do you walk into that
[36:25] courtroom you know you did it
[36:27] but the the jurors
[36:30] look at the prosecutor the prosecutor
[36:32] looks at the defense attorney defense
[36:34] attorney looks at the judge and said
[36:36] will Hunter Witnesses
[36:42] wouldn't that make you feel good
[36:44] even though you knew you did it
[36:47] but you walk in the door and you don't
[36:48] say a word
[36:50] and they're all going I didn't see it
[36:52] they went call witness call Witness
[36:55] nobody comes to the door
[36:57] that's the way it is
[37:00] with our sins and whatever we do our
[37:03] life
[37:04] we gotta understand that when we walk
[37:06] into that room we're already forgiven
[37:09] and not just forgiven they don't know
[37:13] you did it
[37:17] because you're going yeah yeah no
[37:19] where's Witness
[37:21] hey now what Jesus said to the woman
[37:24] they threw her down and said hey she was
[37:26] calling the actual adultery
[37:29] in other words he said did y'all see it
[37:32] I didn't see it
[37:35] they said oh yeah we saw it we saw it
[37:38] well about two minutes later they were
[37:40] gone somewhere else
[37:42] there was some condemnation inside of
[37:44] them that sent them somewhere else and
[37:46] believe you me it must have been
[37:48] something with more condemnation than
[37:50] they wanted that girl killed
[37:52] because the law said Stoner because they
[37:55] watched her commit adultery but what did
[37:58] Jesus do he got rid of their accusers he
[38:00] got rid of all the witnesses and he says
[38:03] I don't see it
[38:05] I didn't see it
[38:07] go on he said go on and sin no more
[38:10] don't do that again now
[38:12] same way with us don't do that again
[38:15] because we're going to look at godliness
[38:16] where godliness is not you just keep
[38:18] doing the same thing over and over again
[38:22] we gotta get rid of that stuff every
[38:23] once in a while
[38:25] don't you remember when you first got
[38:27] saved all that stuff you got over that
[38:29] you got over
[38:31] kicked out moved out shoved out kicked
[38:34] out didn't want no more
[38:36] it didn't even feel good to be where you
[38:38] thought you were before
[38:41] that's the step of godliness
[38:44] that's the step of godliness because
[38:46] look it wasn't godliness it got you in
[38:48] that place where you that
[38:51] it was the devil that got you in the
[38:53] place where you was at
[38:56] brother Ramsey you can turn this down or
[38:58] you can accept it to turn it down is to
[39:00] be lost and remain potassium calcium
[39:02] petroleum but to accept it and have a
[39:05] new heart a new spirit in his Spirit
[39:07] part of the logos in you controlling
[39:10] your emotions
[39:11] controlling your emotions
[39:14] that's
[39:16] what sometimes we have we want
[39:18] uncontrolled emotions we want to
[39:19] shouting in the speaking in tongues and
[39:21] running the owls and all that that's
[39:22] good fine and dandy but where's the new
[39:25] heart in the new spirit
[39:27] where's his spirit
[39:28] where's part of the logos app
[39:31] and you controlling your emotions and
[39:33] when he accused through his word you
[39:35] coup back and answer to him
[39:39] that's why you should say Amen when the
[39:40] preacher's preaching
[39:42] because you're agreeing with the if the
[39:44] logos is inside of you you're agreeing
[39:46] because it's pulling it's bringing those
[39:49] two together
[39:51] you might you might not know somebody
[39:52] from nobody but he comes up here and
[39:54] preaches a wonderful sermon and you
[39:56] connect with that brother well you don't
[39:58] know him you haven't known him a day
[40:02] so what is it then it's what's inside of
[40:05] you is what connects
[40:11] now you're gonna have to make a choice
[40:13] Jesus said never worked man word be a
[40:15] line mine be truth
[40:17] now you got to make up your mind now
[40:19] watch that where it says let every man's
[40:20] word be alive
[40:22] and mine be true every
[40:25] man's word
[40:28] be a lie
[40:30] and mine be the truth
[40:33] now you got to make up your mind you've
[40:35] got to make a choice and this may be
[40:37] your last time to make a choice
[40:39] tomorrow may be too late God might have
[40:42] chose you to eternal life now this is to
[40:45] me this is an outstanding quote this
[40:46] just takes away the pulling through the
[40:48] tube and God's going to make you saved
[40:50] and he's made you saved from the
[40:52] foundation of the world well
[40:55] God might have chose you to eternal life
[40:57] but if you don't make up your mind
[41:00] those pieces have got to match now God's
[41:03] so much or he saw him not
[41:06] but it was because what you chose but if
[41:09] you don't make up your mind and accept
[41:10] it
[41:11] she'll take your place in other words
[41:13] why
[41:15] it's moving on
[41:16] because somebody's gonna want it he saw
[41:18] somebody on it
[41:20] so he's going to move on further
[41:22] just like me and you there's more to
[41:25] this message than just brother Brown was
[41:26] a prophet
[41:27] there's more to this message even that
[41:30] we get the Holy Ghost and just start
[41:32] living right
[41:36] Philippians 2 verse 15 says that you may
[41:38] be blameless and harmless
[41:41] the sons of God look without rebuke
[41:47] well let me tell you something that's
[41:49] not talking about your regular life
[41:52] because you get rebuked all the time
[41:55] why do you women do this why do you
[41:57] women not cut your hair why do you women
[41:58] not do this why do you men not do this
[42:00] what do you mean you you don't you don't
[42:03] you don't say a little bad word every
[42:04] once in a while
[42:07] hmm
[42:10] I'm telling you that's what we're fixing
[42:12] to see that's what's going to separate
[42:13] us and put us into where the the Bible
[42:17] tells us life and godliness and it's in
[42:19] second Peter well we've been talking
[42:21] about the Statue of perfect man it puts
[42:23] us into that
[42:24] I mean listen did you walk in here today
[42:27] and just totally believe you were
[42:29] blameless of everything you've done no
[42:31] I'll go and answer that for you
[42:33] number one if you said yes you'd been
[42:35] lying and that took the other blameless
[42:36] part out amen
[42:39] we come to church to get rid of those
[42:41] things right
[42:44] right way come on somebody we do it the
[42:47] right way we've been told how to do it
[42:49] we know we should know how to do it
[42:52] if we do that that makes us blameless
[42:56] that doesn't have to what you're saying
[42:58] rehash
[42:59] hurry up or bring something back up
[43:03] that you may be blameless and harmless
[43:06] the sons of God without rebuke
[43:09] look in the midst of a crooked and
[43:12] perverse nation in other words God did
[43:14] not take us and put us on an island and
[43:16] say hey bride you live right here
[43:18] because y'all are special people
[43:22] how easy would that be
[43:24] if everything we've done revolved around
[43:26] the Bible the church and the message
[43:29] wow well that's what we're going to live
[43:31] in
[43:32] that's what we're heading toward but not
[43:35] now
[43:36] God put us in the midst of a crooked and
[43:39] a perverse Nation put us in the most
[43:43] perverse Church age
[43:49] among whom you shine as lights
[43:53] in the world Genesis 17 1.
[43:57] when Abram was 90 years old and nine the
[43:59] Lord appeared to Abram and said unto him
[44:01] I am the almighty God walk before me and
[44:04] be thou perfect
[44:06] all right let's get into this just for a
[44:08] minute
[44:09] That Word Perfect means one who lacks
[44:11] nothing now look and they talk about in
[44:13] physical strength and beauty
[44:15] their sound wholesome complete
[44:19] morally innocent
[44:25] that's a hard one to swallow
[44:28] happy integrity
[44:31] one who is morally and ethically pure
[44:35] now let's talk about that in just a
[44:37] minute
[44:39] stop right here
[44:41] that word perfecting because the Bible
[44:43] talks about how we're going to get
[44:44] perfected the perfecting of the Saints
[44:45] is going to be given to us by the
[44:47] ministry of the Gospel of Jesus Christ
[44:49] all right somebody's getting up behind
[44:51] this pulpit and ministering to you are
[44:54] there our brother Bob or the different
[44:56] ones asking questions helping people
[44:59] that's just the way this economy works
[45:01] and we can't do it no different
[45:04] you know why because it won't work why
[45:06] God wanted
[45:07] he saw
[45:11] how they'd be a division of people that
[45:13] wouldn't want it over here
[45:15] but he saw that big group of people that
[45:18] would consistently listen to pastors
[45:20] prophets teachers evangelists
[45:22] and get Perfection from that not
[45:25] Perfection from this over here
[45:27] all right because remember there's a
[45:29] guardly and an ungodly
[45:31] there's godliness and there's
[45:33] ungodliness
[45:35] all that live Godly in Christ will what
[45:37] suffer persecution
[45:40] listen it's not so much they hate you
[45:43] they hate that Spirit that's inside of
[45:45] you because it's different from what
[45:48] just for example I was telling you about
[45:50] work
[45:52] and one girl she just spit off a couple
[45:54] of good ones and she goes to the Baptist
[45:57] Church for me in general
[45:58] married in
[46:00] she's a good girl
[46:02] but Lord she let it go one day
[46:05] and I just looked at her and I said
[46:08] I just hmm you know just kind of It kind
[46:11] of floored me a little bit
[46:13] she said well that's the only that you
[46:15] know in other words if that's the worst
[46:16] thing I've ever said and that's why I
[46:18] said I said would you say that in front
[46:19] of your preacher she said well if that's
[46:21] the worst thing he ever heard from me
[46:22] that'd be all right so you know you
[46:23] start backing up and smoothing all that
[46:25] over you know I made a mistake you ain't
[46:27] perfect
[46:29] that's the same thing she said she
[46:30] looked at me and she said you've never
[46:32] said nothing like that I said not in 20
[46:34] something years after the Lord saved my
[46:36] soul here did not I have not
[46:39] they don't understand that though
[46:41] because they're they're seemingly
[46:43] righteous
[46:45] holy
[46:48] they're seemingly different than the
[46:50] world out there that just throws f-bombs
[46:52] and all this all every every breath they
[46:54] got
[46:56] but they're just not seeing that they're
[46:58] the same as that they still got that
[47:01] same spirit
[47:04] The Same Spirit that they had then what
[47:07] happened Satan has just coded it over
[47:09] right
[47:10] with religion
[47:13] he just coded all this over with
[47:16] religion oh it's okay
[47:19] oh it's okay
[47:22] for your sisters to wear pants to church
[47:24] that's okay it's okay for you you men to
[47:27] you don't have a little social drink
[47:28] every once in a while or or you know if
[47:31] you real thirsty get you get your colon
[47:35] I got one today
[47:37] Diet Mountain Dew
[47:39] I know that's hard for some but
[47:43] it's good I like that mountain
[47:48] so what's the difference
[47:50] what's an Emerson me working out in the
[47:53] yard
[47:53] and drinking water are are thinking I'm
[47:56] going to get a night Mountain Dew then
[47:58] for then for you know not our neighbor
[48:00] but just say neighbor
[48:02] does the same thing
[48:04] well he goes home and he either he's got
[48:06] a six-pack or he goes and gets one you
[48:08] understand what I'm saying so life and
[48:11] godliness has got to work together
[48:14] it can't work separate you can't have
[48:17] one one uh you can't have I almost said
[48:20] her name you can't have the girl at work
[48:22] you know saying a few this and that and
[48:24] the others
[48:26] and then she moved over here and she
[48:28] says well you're not perfect
[48:30] and and don't tell me you don't say them
[48:33] things listen they they will they'll
[48:36] call you a liar
[48:38] they'll call you a liar she almost did
[48:42] I say I'm never
[48:44] in 20 something years since I've been
[48:46] saved now
[48:47] ah
[48:50] and then they're like oh come on
[48:53] are you secret Center that's just like
[48:55] job's accusers that's your right ball
[48:57] they got a bunch of me around you like
[49:00] you really do you kind of have a rough
[49:02] time you might I bet you slipped up on
[49:05] one there a couple days ago didn't you
[49:07] no you just had life
[49:11] so let's talk about this just for a
[49:13] minute is everybody all right
[49:14] godliness it's reverence all right
[49:17] respect party towards God and I'm gonna
[49:21] say one thing else piety toward each
[49:24] other
[49:25] respect toward each other
[49:28] amen respect for elders have went out
[49:31] the door
[49:34] respect for parents has went out the
[49:36] door
[49:38] respect for anything the Bible tells us
[49:41] if you're even a Slave
[49:45] hello somebody
[49:47] treat your boss right
[49:49] I'm sorry treat your owner
[49:53] right
[49:54] well that's even worse treat your owner
[49:57] right
[49:58] hmm so let's talk a minute about life
[50:00] and governance it's okay
[50:04] without controversy great is this
[50:08] mystery of godliness
[50:09] you don't watch the mystery because
[50:11] people can't without the Holy Ghost they
[50:13] can't live it
[50:15] without the Holy Ghost because God was
[50:17] manifested in the flesh your flesh
[50:21] that's why like I said before you got
[50:23] this group over here that just don't
[50:24] care
[50:26] curse like sailors
[50:28] then you got that group in between
[50:32] that slip up on one every once in a
[50:34] while
[50:37] now I want to ask you something
[50:40] slipping up on one
[50:43] shouldn't be
[50:45] now
[50:47] listen slipping up on one in your
[50:49] justification yes sir yes ma'am
[50:53] come on
[50:54] brother Brown said that unclean spirit
[50:56] is still inside of you at justification
[50:59] making you do what you did before it's
[51:01] just that everything you had done before
[51:03] has been chopped off
[51:08] that's why we're looking at the higher
[51:10] form of justification and I'm gonna do a
[51:11] sermon on that the the the higher form
[51:14] of justification because when we get in
[51:16] here and we get when we get to the to
[51:19] the baptism of the Holy Ghost and we
[51:21] start living this godliness and we start
[51:22] seeing that
[51:25] that we can live it
[51:27] listen I've come to conclusion I can
[51:29] live this
[51:31] amen now you may not
[51:33] the altar's open
[51:35] get that thing off you or out of you
[51:38] I've come to the conclusion this is it
[51:43] sure have eight mistakes you know what
[51:45] when she said what she did I thought the
[51:48] same thing in my head
[51:50] well now get quiet on me
[51:59] but we didn't entertain it like we used
[52:01] to entertain it
[52:03] you let that bird just fly right on by
[52:07] see that see bro John when we see that
[52:09] we're
[52:10] thank you Lord
[52:12] get lost we've been taught to know that
[52:15] that's not condemning me even though I
[52:18] did come in here
[52:20] even though I did but what did he do it
[52:22] didn't reside there it just moved on
[52:24] through
[52:26] because we still have a carnal mind we
[52:28] have to deal with but you and I are
[52:29] going to have to here in godliness we
[52:31] got to separate that thing
[52:34] we make mistakes we are not
[52:37] p-e-r-f-e-c-t as the world sees perfect
[52:41] all right
[52:43] never make a wrong move
[52:46] everything at work goes exactly 100
[52:48] percent
[52:50] every time
[52:52] because perfect is every time
[52:55] see that's what they're
[53:05] working but when it comes down to
[53:06] situations of life and godlinesses we're
[53:09] going to see in just a minute
[53:11] there is life that we have to live life
[53:13] listen uh coming here
[53:16] us coming here into this world is
[53:19] contrary to God
[53:23] it is not so
[53:25] it's not the way it should have been
[53:28] with me
[53:30] the Eternal part of God's mind can't
[53:33] change
[53:34] that's what we're getting to
[53:37] we come down here curiously wrong in the
[53:41] lower parts of the earth my substance
[53:43] was hid from thee
[53:45] what me my Humanity
[53:52] but what happened at the new birth
[53:55] that's why it's called a new birth we
[53:57] had a chance
[53:59] come on
[54:01] we had a chance to be born right
[54:03] we had a chance to be born the way we
[54:05] should have been
[54:07] that's your new birth not just that I'm
[54:09] going to get the Holy Ghost just gonna
[54:10] clean this out and I'm going to just
[54:17] brings you to a realization that you
[54:19] have to Paul I preached about 25 sermons
[54:22] on it do you remember that pop said the
[54:24] life I now live
[54:26] which many lived another one before
[54:29] the life I now live I live by the faith
[54:32] of Jesus Christ you and I didn't
[54:34] I did not first life according to Jesus
[54:36] Christ
[54:40] well you can agree with it or not I'm
[54:42] going to tell you you did
[54:46] but we've got to as bride
[54:49] we've got to do you know you see the you
[54:52] see the the story of the Three Sisters
[54:53] and and the armor meat packing boy and
[54:55] and you know you look at brother Branham
[54:57] and you look this way you see you know
[54:59] it was a party
[55:01] Houses full of people
[55:04] a bunch of girls
[55:05] bunch of Bride
[55:07] potential bride
[55:09] was in that room in that house
[55:13] my mind
[55:14] the three sisters we know were there
[55:16] right so they're putting on their Danish
[55:19] and they're you know they're trying to
[55:20] impress the guy
[55:22] well the real bride wasn't even in that
[55:24] house
[55:30] she wasn't even in the house
[55:32] she wasn't dressed like the world
[55:34] she wasn't acting like them
[55:37] I'm sure them three women looking at
[55:39] this now look let's put the scenario
[55:41] here you've got a an armor meat packing
[55:43] guy that I'm sure at that time he wasn't
[55:45] worth billions of dollars like they are
[55:48] now but very wealthy
[55:51] because they made hot dogs and all that
[55:53] stuff
[55:54] eventually
[55:55] armor if you don't know Armory is a hot
[55:57] dog okay
[55:59] it's not an Oscar Mayer Wiener because
[56:01] you couldn't sing I wish you were an
[56:02] Oscar anyway
[56:06] so you know those three girls did
[56:08] everything in their power that they
[56:10] thought now come on people they thought
[56:12] they could get to him
[56:15] because you know what they were looking
[56:16] at they weren't looking at his love they
[56:18] were looking at his money
[56:20] and his status and his
[56:23] you know he's up here we're down here
[56:27] to watch the wash woman my best brother
[56:29] said the fourth girl
[56:31] I like that number four when it comes to
[56:33] humans
[56:40] she heard his what she heard his voice
[56:43] she probably heard all that going on
[56:47] and then the armor meat packing guy like
[56:49] God does sometimes he said I'm disgusted
[56:52] I I don't even want to be in that room
[56:53] with him people
[56:55] I'm gonna go find me somebody
[56:57] that I can talk to
[56:59] and he talked to her
[57:02] great is a mystery of godliness
[57:05] she was trying her best to live a Godly
[57:07] life because she had separated herself
[57:11] from the world
[57:13] are from that going on inside everybody
[57:15] with me
[57:17] all right so
[57:21] denominations let's look at this real
[57:22] quick
[57:23] and then we'll probably we'll just close
[57:25] here because we can finish it Sunday
[57:27] won't be too long
[57:30] you look at life in godliness all right
[57:32] so without controversy great is the
[57:34] mystery of godliness now it is a mystery
[57:36] until now the prophet of God says the
[57:38] mystery has now been made known or the
[57:40] mystery is now history
[57:42] so we have the book open to tell us how
[57:46] to live Godly
[57:53] all right now look
[57:55] this comes up in our communion
[57:58] when we are judged
[58:01] we are chastened
[58:03] of the Lord
[58:05] chasten means instructed
[58:10] for 60 years now since the prophet's
[58:13] gone we have been instructed sometimes
[58:15] by different we have been destructed by
[58:18] some
[58:19] but we have been instructed by a group
[58:22] of ministers that's brought everybody
[58:24] brought us to a place not just us here
[58:26] but there's there's Ministry around the
[58:28] world that's brought up people that
[58:30] brought people that have instructed the
[58:33] people or they've been chastened of the
[58:35] Lord look that we should not be
[58:38] condemned with the world
[58:41] all right so the world is condemned why
[58:45] let's just throw the blanket out and
[58:47] let's I mean we know one thing's for
[58:49] sure we know that they're condemned
[58:51] because they don't have the new birth
[58:53] all right so let's just get that out of
[58:54] the way but let's go over a few things
[58:56] and let's see how that we can live Godly
[58:58] in Christ how that we can live a life
[59:00] that's close to him
[59:03] everybody with me
[59:05] number one
[59:07] we don't have a horse forehead
[59:11] think about it
[59:13] we are not a denomination
[59:15] we don't believe in denominations
[59:19] so we have been separated from that
[59:22] group
[59:23] of the and her harlots
[59:26] all right everybody with me so that's
[59:28] just one I'm not gonna put them one two
[59:29] three but that's that's one way that we
[59:32] can live Godly in Christ
[59:34] we don't have a moniker on our
[59:36] denomination where do you go church I'm
[59:39] Baptist remember what your brother said
[59:40] to that woman said are you a Christian
[59:41] I'm Methodist
[59:43] that's hard to say now
[59:45] but
[59:47] we don't have that title
[59:49] I hope you don't say we're message
[59:51] Believers and that's the reason we born
[59:53] again
[59:54] no we're born again because we know how
[59:57] we know how to get born again we know
[59:59] how to get just we know how it feels to
[1:00:01] be justified come on somebody we know
[1:00:03] how it feels to be Sanctified if you
[1:00:06] don't please
[1:00:09] please don't sleep until you realize
[1:00:12] that God has cleaned you up that's right
[1:00:17] made you different
[1:00:20] listen give you something to make you
[1:00:22] different bye
[1:00:26] oh listen but people have took it to the
[1:00:29] extreme brother Donnie
[1:00:30] they have calls and to have these you
[1:00:34] got to be with our group you know
[1:00:37] I'm hurting my sheep over here now
[1:00:40] it's the goat that's herding the Sheep
[1:00:46] that's the denomination just wrapped up
[1:00:48] in a message Church
[1:00:52] so we don't have the horse forehead we
[1:00:54] don't have the condemnation that that
[1:00:56] horse system is going to receive
[1:00:58] remember I just read you that we should
[1:01:01] not be condemned with the world why is
[1:01:02] the world going to be condemned because
[1:01:04] they didn't believe
[1:01:05] but there is going to be
[1:01:08] a Catholic church or whatever you want
[1:01:10] to call it a denomination that God hates
[1:01:13] now you can't live Godly in him hate you
[1:01:16] everybody with me on this we're trying
[1:01:19] trying to pile this thing up where it's
[1:01:20] not so such a great big mountain but we
[1:01:23] do have to pile it up and get it
[1:01:24] together
[1:01:29] and I've always wondered
[1:01:31] why brother Branham was talk about a
[1:01:33] woman
[1:01:35] cutting her hair
[1:01:37] the Bible says it's an abomination
[1:01:40] how can you live Godly
[1:01:42] and be an abomination
[1:01:45] can't so see that's another
[1:01:47] separation point
[1:01:50] brother Brown said one time you know he
[1:01:51] said uh God won't even hear the prayer
[1:01:54] but Bob haired woman
[1:01:56] only for her salvation
[1:01:59] you look at people like Joyce Meyers her
[1:02:01] hair shorter than mine
[1:02:03] and she's just people walking across the
[1:02:05] platform and just you know getting
[1:02:06] healed and and supposedly getting a holy
[1:02:09] ghost I ain't gonna say they can't
[1:02:11] but but yeah exactly
[1:02:14] it's kind of
[1:02:16] but David but listen they've attached
[1:02:20] themselves to Godliness
[1:02:23] Joyce Myers don't get up I hope she
[1:02:25] doesn't see this Joyce Meyers don't get
[1:02:27] up in the morning and say
[1:02:29] I'm just as false as I can be
[1:02:31] I'm glad here to save a couple hundred
[1:02:33] thousand people today I'm gonna go out
[1:02:35] here and teach them Seven Falls
[1:02:37] now she gets certain studies just like I
[1:02:40] do
[1:02:41] y'all do
[1:02:43] she gets up she goes to church like some
[1:02:45] of y'all don't
[1:02:51] but she's so deceived though she's still
[1:02:53] got ties to the world
[1:02:56] anybody with me we're trying to untie
[1:02:58] this thing
[1:03:00] because the Bible tells us life and
[1:03:01] godliness and that we should not be
[1:03:03] condemned with the world
[1:03:06] now we can just say and go home and say
[1:03:08] well we have the new birth according to
[1:03:10] Malachi 4 according to Luke 17 30 we
[1:03:13] have the new birth we've been Justified
[1:03:15] Sanctified fill the Holy Ghost we can go
[1:03:16] home
[1:03:18] let's think about just a minute right
[1:03:20] back sitting right back there
[1:03:22] I thought Lord wipe why do this
[1:03:26] why struggle
[1:03:27] we already got eternal life in our soul
[1:03:29] we just go home and sit down
[1:03:33] have you ever not thought about that
[1:03:35] some of you do
[1:03:37] because you do it
[1:03:43] but really I mean if we got the Holy
[1:03:45] Ghost mom come on if we got the Holy
[1:03:47] Ghost why do you have to preach through
[1:03:48] sermon Sunday
[1:03:51] why not practicing music for
[1:03:55] really I mean come on
[1:03:57] we got the Holy Ghost
[1:03:59] we can't not have it if we get it
[1:04:02] right
[1:04:04] but if you got it you want more
[1:04:07] the problem is people think they got it
[1:04:09] and think I'm done this is it now you're
[1:04:12] just starting
[1:04:13] but the denomination we have no horse
[1:04:15] forehead we have no worse thinking we're
[1:04:17] trying to get what the mind of Christ so
[1:04:19] you can't have the mind to Christ and
[1:04:20] have a horse for him nobody with me on
[1:04:22] that remember
[1:04:23] okay I don't want to say that too many
[1:04:25] times but how
[1:04:27] you said if you don't cut your hair
[1:04:29] guess what you will not be condemned
[1:04:31] with the world
[1:04:32] because
[1:04:34] 99.99 of this world
[1:04:37] ladies thinks it's okay to cut your hair
[1:04:40] is that not right am I am I pretty close
[1:04:42] to 99 can I just say 99 just to give one
[1:04:45] percent of the whole world
[1:04:48] I'm talking about the world the world is
[1:04:50] just it's okay to to do that and see
[1:04:54] nothing wrong with wearing pants
[1:04:56] when the Bible says it's an abomination
[1:05:01] for a woman to put on a garment
[1:05:02] pertaining to man
[1:05:04] the world has attached herself to that
[1:05:07] we haven't
[1:05:10] unless you slip around put some on and
[1:05:12] then you're still of the world
[1:05:13] come on somebody
[1:05:16] all right
[1:05:17] so now we're trying not to be condemned
[1:05:19] with the world we're trying to be
[1:05:21] chasing or talked
[1:05:24] what did Brother Brown tell us he said
[1:05:25] Malachi 4 was sent to tie up Loose Ends
[1:05:29] what are loose ends oh it's okay
[1:05:33] no it's okay you can just trim a little
[1:05:35] I mean just you know do like some people
[1:05:37] do and I've seen it here at the church
[1:05:39] same way you don't cut it this way or
[1:05:41] it's obvious but if you cut it this way
[1:05:44] ah
[1:05:46] don't you think we don't see what's
[1:05:48] going on
[1:05:50] but listen God knows for we did
[1:05:53] so don't fool him you're not gonna throw
[1:05:54] him we're not going to be we're going to
[1:05:56] be condemned with the World by not doing
[1:05:58] what God Said
[1:06:00] so we're trying our best to what not be
[1:06:04] condemned with the world
[1:06:05] and then that leads us to Godliness not
[1:06:09] sinless perfection
[1:06:12] that's what that guy that Peter's got he
[1:06:13] said all these all the uh everything
[1:06:16] they say is two things in the
[1:06:17] charismatic movement that that uh
[1:06:20] everybody's in Elijah
[1:06:22] of course he was referring to brother
[1:06:23] Brown and different people and everybody
[1:06:25] thinks that they have sinless Perfection
[1:06:27] and you get a lot of money because of
[1:06:29] that
[1:06:31] he just ain't he's just blinded the bats
[1:06:33] what his problem is
[1:06:35] he's blinded by the what the God of this
[1:06:38] evil age
[1:06:39] he's blinded by ungodliness
[1:06:43] and by Whitney just a second our actions
[1:06:47] our dress
[1:06:49] separates us from the world
[1:06:53] our manner of life as I was saying
[1:06:55] before
[1:06:56] you won't you don't see I you know I
[1:07:00] I do I want to say this
[1:07:02] you take a denomination like the Church
[1:07:04] of there in town in Gillsville or any
[1:07:07] other Church
[1:07:08] and you know that it's nothing to them
[1:07:11] to smoke a little cigarette or take a
[1:07:13] little drink or say a little bad word
[1:07:14] just like the girl did
[1:07:17] there's no teaching for that
[1:07:20] it's all okay
[1:07:22] because we're not perfected we're not
[1:07:24] perfect
[1:07:25] can't be Godly when the Bible tells us
[1:07:28] I've got 10 more scriptures that says
[1:07:31] be Godly
[1:07:34] sure mannerisms of life
[1:07:39] you take churches
[1:07:41] take this church
[1:07:44] no more
[1:07:45] reach your hand out like this
[1:07:48] pay me some money no reach your hand out
[1:07:50] like this and do this right here
[1:07:52] pat yourself on the back
[1:07:55] because y'all are not any of you in a
[1:07:57] divorce case none of you are in a
[1:07:59] domestic violence case none of you have
[1:08:02] been put in jail for DUI
[1:08:05] am I I hope I'm not hitting somebody
[1:08:07] here
[1:08:10] turn the camera off
[1:08:13] altar
[1:08:17] but see we look at it and we think
[1:08:19] there's no way we can do this
[1:08:22] but Donnie just to look at these people
[1:08:26] I'm serious look look at these people
[1:08:29] y'all live cleaner than anybody on the
[1:08:31] face of this Earth
[1:08:36] you live more Godly
[1:08:38] than anybody on the face of the Earth
[1:08:41] that's what God's looking for because
[1:08:43] remember he's looking for our separated
[1:08:45] people
[1:08:46] he's not looking for a perfect people
[1:08:49] he's looking for separated people that
[1:08:51] becomes as this list is showing us that
[1:08:54] we're not being condemned with the world
[1:08:58] we don't need
[1:09:01] bless your heart you get these big
[1:09:03] churches and they have they have a uh
[1:09:05] you know they have a Ministry for
[1:09:07] divorce people
[1:09:10] they have a Ministry for single people
[1:09:12] that are divorced that are looking to
[1:09:14] get married again
[1:09:17] let's try that out every once in a while
[1:09:20] no we don't ever do that that's not in
[1:09:23] our curriculum
[1:09:24] anybody with me do you understand what
[1:09:26] I'm saying you sitting here today you
[1:09:28] live more Godly than anybody on the face
[1:09:30] of the Earth
[1:09:32] and but you go I will ask I just I got
[1:09:36] mad
[1:09:37] but what
[1:09:42] I drove somebody off the road you better
[1:09:43] not do that
[1:09:45] foreign
[1:09:50] huh
[1:09:53] listen
[1:09:54] some of y'all are not behind bars
[1:09:57] right 99.9 I hope not I had to go get it
[1:10:01] I'll be out of jail yet why because you
[1:10:03] try to live the law here
[1:10:06] through the law
[1:10:07] of life and godliness
[1:10:11] the law you see
[1:10:14] on your book
[1:10:16] keeps you away from the law man had you
[1:10:19] know why man had to write a law
[1:10:22] so I broke it
[1:10:24] you know why you look you look at these
[1:10:26] lawnmowers
[1:10:29] you look down at the deck of the
[1:10:31] lawnmower and it's got a guy with his
[1:10:33] fingers whacked off says do not put your
[1:10:35] hand in this hole do you know why they
[1:10:37] put that sticker there
[1:10:39] somebody put their hand in that hole and
[1:10:42] it tore their fingers off
[1:10:44] all right that's what I lost for the law
[1:10:47] for DUI look I remember when we used to
[1:10:49] when we were growing up there wasn't a
[1:10:51] lot they wanted a DUI Law I mean you
[1:10:53] just they just take you home you know
[1:10:54] what they do they take you home I don't
[1:10:56] know that personally but I've heard
[1:10:59] praise the Lord
[1:11:02] but but you see how we develop now
[1:11:05] though we don't have to worry about that
[1:11:06] we don't have to have an alcoholics
[1:11:08] anonymous group to meet in church
[1:11:11] are y'all getting what I'm saying
[1:11:13] count that stuff off
[1:11:15] count that part that you don't have to
[1:11:17] deal with you don't have to go home and
[1:11:20] deal with well if my wife's gonna
[1:11:22] divorce me or not
[1:11:23] no you're gonna work your problems out
[1:11:27] through God
[1:11:30] and godly people
[1:11:33] everybody with me
[1:11:36] that we be not condemned
[1:11:39] with the world
[1:11:41] we're being instructed
[1:11:45] by the Holy Ghost
[1:11:47] second Peter 1 3 says according as his
[1:11:50] divine power has given us all things
[1:11:52] that pertain unto life and godliness
[1:11:56] now that's part of statue of perfect man
[1:11:58] through the knowledge of him look for
[1:12:00] through the knowledge of him who's him
[1:12:03] not me not brother Dale not to other
[1:12:05] ministers
[1:12:06] through the Lord Jesus in a Ministry
[1:12:11] and by with me in a Ministry
[1:12:13] that ministers to us
[1:12:17] I mean listen come on we go through hard
[1:12:19] times as as parents as as
[1:12:22] um husband and wife
[1:12:24] um
[1:12:25] let's get away from in-laws but
[1:12:29] we'll talk about that later
[1:12:31] when there's not so many people here
[1:12:32] maybe two or three
[1:12:35] but even with that
[1:12:37] I mean we joke and cut up
[1:12:39] but we love we love the people that were
[1:12:41] around
[1:12:44] you might not like to be around them all
[1:12:46] the time
[1:12:48] but there's a love that wants to see
[1:12:50] them see what you see
[1:12:53] is that not your
[1:12:58] make them do something I want them to
[1:13:00] see God
[1:13:01] and start acting like it
[1:13:05] I was looking the other day that you
[1:13:08] look through and you see
[1:13:10] um take psychologists for example
[1:13:13] psychologist for everything now
[1:13:16] for your pets
[1:13:20] figure that one out and call me in the
[1:13:22] morning
[1:13:23] for your pets
[1:13:25] hold on for you and your past
[1:13:31] didn't program say this world was going
[1:13:33] insane
[1:13:34] it's here
[1:13:35] it's here
[1:13:37] it's here I mean all this stuff that
[1:13:40] goes on you you look at all this gun
[1:13:42] violence and everything going on
[1:13:44] we don't have to worry about that
[1:13:47] if you're born again filled with the
[1:13:48] Holy Ghost you come to church and you do
[1:13:51] your job and your duty
[1:13:53] you're not thinking about shooting up a
[1:13:54] school
[1:13:56] come on you're not that's not even your
[1:13:59] thought process
[1:14:01] but I promise you it's in some of their
[1:14:03] thought process because they're doing it
[1:14:04] every day
[1:14:06] you know we don't hear about it we don't
[1:14:08] collectively put it together but after
[1:14:10] that one shooting in in Louisville
[1:14:14] that was a hundred
[1:14:16] Louisville sorry not Louisville
[1:14:17] Louisville that was 163 mass shootings
[1:14:21] prior to that from January to that day
[1:14:25] 163
[1:14:27] mass shootings which is two or more
[1:14:30] people getting killed
[1:14:33] this weekend
[1:14:35] Chicago
[1:14:36] 43 people shot
[1:14:39] Nine Dead
[1:14:42] in one weekend because it's Memorial Day
[1:14:45] and everybody's all hyped up
[1:14:48] but Memorial Day is to what pay homage
[1:14:51] to the people that died well some of
[1:14:53] them decided to go ahead and be part of
[1:14:55] that people
[1:14:59] but you and I
[1:15:01] we don't look at that day as anything
[1:15:03] different
[1:15:04] am I getting somewhere
[1:15:06] we just think that you know Satan just
[1:15:09] beats us up about stuff little stuff
[1:15:12] but godliness
[1:15:15] as we'll look in just a minute maybe no
[1:15:17] we're not godliness with contentment
[1:15:21] with contentment
[1:15:24] listen
[1:15:25] you know what love is
[1:15:28] you know what real love is is
[1:15:29] contentment
[1:15:32] I love my wife
[1:15:34] and I am content with her
[1:15:37] just in filio love
[1:15:40] because I'm content I don't have to go
[1:15:42] in and and have a gun battle with her
[1:15:49] she'd lose
[1:15:53] because she wouldn't want to shoot
[1:15:54] nobody she was that way
[1:15:57] but that is the thought process in the
[1:15:59] world though domestic violence is just
[1:16:01] rampant what is that that's a husband
[1:16:03] and a wife
[1:16:04] that's two people that's supposed to be
[1:16:06] so in love with each other they can't do
[1:16:07] without each other come on somebody
[1:16:12] yet
[1:16:14] there's logs now
[1:16:16] because of all this
[1:16:18] then all you gotta do is pick the phone
[1:16:19] up and say hey my husband smacked me
[1:16:21] upside the head well he goes to jail for
[1:16:23] 48 hours there ain't no attorney you
[1:16:25] don't you don't pass go you definitely
[1:16:26] don't collect two hundred dollars
[1:16:28] right
[1:16:29] that's why they made it so serious to
[1:16:31] separate
[1:16:37] work on your issues
[1:16:40] dude and I've been married 44 years
[1:16:44] yeah we still surprised each other
[1:16:48] she said amen
[1:16:52] but we there's no thought there's not a
[1:16:54] thought process in my mind of getting
[1:16:55] rid of her
[1:16:57] come on people
[1:17:00] but this world is full of people
[1:17:03] that would love to get rid of their
[1:17:05] spouse
[1:17:06] do you see that woman the other day
[1:17:08] she's some kind of advocate and she's
[1:17:09] some kind of they love her and she's
[1:17:10] some kind of oh you know angel and a
[1:17:12] guru
[1:17:13] they got her for poisoning her husband
[1:17:18] slowly killed him while she was doing
[1:17:21] Oprah Winfrey and all these other places
[1:17:25] telling everybody how great everything
[1:17:26] was she's in jail now
[1:17:29] because she was
[1:17:31] she didn't like her husband
[1:17:33] you see how the mentality of people are
[1:17:37] but would that enter you please don't
[1:17:39] answer this question would that enter
[1:17:41] your mind
[1:17:42] let's look over and say I just like I
[1:17:45] just like to get rid of her or him
[1:17:49] you know why we're not because we're
[1:17:50] separated
[1:17:53] we're separated from that
[1:17:55] now the old me what would have stopped
[1:17:57] it the old you what would have stopped
[1:17:59] it come on somebody
[1:18:00] it wouldn't have
[1:18:02] you're going to do what you are inside
[1:18:05] but now that we have that Advocate we
[1:18:07] have all the different things inside of
[1:18:09] us that takes us
[1:18:12] to this right here and then let's stand
[1:18:13] our feet we'll come to A.M close right
[1:18:16] here
[1:18:17] we're about giving unto us exceeding
[1:18:19] great and precious promises listen
[1:18:23] the world has no promise
[1:18:29] tell me that it does
[1:18:32] now
[1:18:35] none
[1:18:38] ask him
[1:18:40] ask a non-Christian say
[1:18:43] what do you think we're going to do here
[1:18:45] in about another six months or a year
[1:18:46] you know they're getting ready in July
[1:18:48] to change the uh change the currency
[1:18:51] not go completely by their dollar
[1:18:53] anymore
[1:18:54] well hello somebody we already read that
[1:18:56] news
[1:18:57] 50 years ago we got prophesied that
[1:19:00] so we shouldn't be going really
[1:19:06] like Darren said one time if we'd just
[1:19:09] really listen to what brother Brown said
[1:19:10] we'd all bought gold a long time ago
[1:19:14] I mean really if it's going to go to
[1:19:16] some astronomical amount of money and
[1:19:18] then the Pope's gonna that's the only
[1:19:19] way you're gonna be able to buy or sale
[1:19:21] and the Pope's gonna you know reimburse
[1:19:22] you for that we should have bought a
[1:19:24] bunch of gold
[1:19:26] but that's not gonna get us out of here
[1:19:29] children go Have I None
[1:19:32] but such as I have
[1:19:34] I give unto you
[1:19:37] amen rise up and walk
[1:19:40] that by these you might be partakers
[1:19:42] what these promises that I was telling
[1:19:43] you that's why the prophet of God had to
[1:19:45] come that's why zeroopable had to
[1:19:47] rebuild that house
[1:19:49] he had to rebuild that Temple and what
[1:19:51] Temple was he rebuilding Jefferson
[1:19:52] Tabernacle brother Brown Tabernacle no

[1:20:10] having escaped look having escaped
[1:20:15] that's good enough for me
[1:20:18] having escaped the corruption that is in
[1:20:21] this world
[1:20:23] through lust that's a promise
[1:20:25] but look though verse five we'll stop
[1:20:28] right there come on musician
[1:20:30] and besides this what we thought this
[1:20:33] whole sermon was the I mean we're up to
[1:20:35] Capstone now we're just getting started
[1:20:39] Faith virtue and all his Temperance
[1:20:41] patience godliness brotherly kindness

[1:20:47] Headstone on
[1:20:49] but it's not the headstone
[1:20:52] besides this this giving all diligence
[1:20:57] ad
[1:21:01] we'll talk about a deity
[1:21:03] this weekend
[1:21:05] because you and I
[1:21:07] are deity
[1:21:09] if you have the Holy Ghost
[1:21:11] and deity doesn't make a mistake deity
[1:21:14] doesn't go backwards
[1:21:16] deity is not held accountable to mistake
[1:21:24] Jesus he made all kind of mistakes
[1:21:29] well yeah he learned by the things he
[1:21:31] suffered he was a human
[1:21:33] we learn by the things we suffer
[1:21:36] I mean you should love your even even at
[1:21:38] Mom and Dad's age it's 60 something
[1:21:40] years or being married might be 81
[1:21:42] Monday
[1:21:44] you should still be bindings closer
[1:21:46] together
[1:21:48] did we not get dude we get married to
[1:21:50] Jesus Christ when we got the new birth
[1:21:52] did we not
[1:21:54] and we hate him more now than we did
[1:21:56] then
[1:21:59] we don't like him now we like him then
[1:22:02] but we don't like him now
[1:22:07] love him more
[1:22:11] sure there's things we have to deal with
[1:22:13] in life absolutely
[1:22:15] but don't let them overrule your
[1:22:19] Christianity
[1:22:21] live what you preach
[1:22:24] all of us
[1:22:27] and listen I can start a list over here
[1:22:29] where we all failed
[1:22:31] but not from the Bible
[1:22:34] not from this deity part that we're
[1:22:36] talking about not from this godliness if
[1:22:39] the Bible tells us to be Godly
[1:22:41] or have godliness there's got to be a
[1:22:45] door
[1:22:46] for us to get into that
[1:22:48] there's godliness right here
[1:22:51] but it's shut off
[1:22:53] it's shut off and we can't get to it you
[1:22:55] know who shut it off Satan shut it off
[1:22:58] First Church age Jesus or Jesus but the
[1:23:02] the
[1:23:03] Holy Ghost Jesus standing there though
[1:23:05] right in the church ages he said you've
[1:23:08] lost your first love
[1:23:13] and me
[1:23:15] now you don't like me no more
[1:23:18] come on
[1:23:20] kids you better put that in your cap
[1:23:25] you love a guy and you give your heart
[1:23:27] to him he's yours for life and you
[1:23:29] better believe that
[1:23:31] don't make him out to be a liar I hate a
[1:23:33] lot of lies goes on during the wedding
[1:23:34] ceremony
[1:23:38] but they but in the world though
[1:23:43] statistics tells us
[1:23:46] 50 percent of people divorce in the
[1:23:49] first five years
[1:23:52] statistics so it must be right
[1:23:58] as bride
[1:24:02] is that what we're looking at
[1:24:06] I'm gonna I'm gonna love him
[1:24:09] until he don't get but when he gets sick
[1:24:12] or when we have to live in a trailer we
[1:24:14] started out living in a in a nice little
[1:24:16] like 1800 square foot house which cost
[1:24:19] you four hundred thousand dollars now
[1:24:20] but um me and June started out in a
[1:24:23] trailer and poor old mom and daddy we
[1:24:24] had to scrub the thing we actually
[1:24:26] literally opened the doors mama
[1:24:28] she'll tell you I ain't lying not
[1:24:31] exaggerating we scrape stuff off the
[1:24:34] floor
[1:24:36] open all the doors took a water hose
[1:24:39] and scrubbed that trailer out before we
[1:24:42] me and Jim could live in it but guess
[1:24:44] what
[1:24:45] it must have been all right okay must
[1:24:47] have been all right we live in a pretty
[1:24:49] good house now so we're okay we're good
[1:24:51] you know why because we progressed in
[1:24:53] love
[1:24:55] but I promise you one thing
[1:24:57] if I ever had to go back and live in
[1:24:59] that again I would I'd live it with her
[1:25:02] don't don't open I would I'd live it
[1:25:05] with her I don't believe in nobody else
[1:25:07] because we've been through it
[1:25:10] same way with your Christianity we are
[1:25:12] being going through it and being going
[1:25:14] through it and all of our Christian
[1:25:15] Journey every little thing that we do
[1:25:17] and we can't We're Not Gonna and God
[1:25:18] We're not gonna go back to living in a
[1:25:20] trailer
[1:25:21] we're going to
[1:25:23] we're going to a mansion that's already
[1:25:26] prepared and it's not prepared on his
[1:25:28] idea
[1:25:30] it's prepared on your idea
[1:25:33] it's built for you and me that's how
[1:25:35] much he loves us that's how much he
[1:25:38] knows we can do this
[1:25:40] we can and will overcome I'll promise
[1:25:43] you the Bible tells us he that
[1:25:44] overcometh
[1:25:47] let's give him some time to work
[1:25:50] give God time to work with your Humanity
[1:25:52] if you're having problems I know we all
[1:25:55] do
[1:25:56] but when I'm talking about this one when
[1:25:57] God requires us to be Godly he's got to
[1:25:59] make a way and I just told you the way
[1:26:01] to do it and you're doing it already you
[1:26:03] just don't realize it
[1:26:06] if you're living Godly you're living
[1:26:08] pure no drink no smoking no no no all
[1:26:12] that
[1:26:12] hey I have the battle's over
[1:26:16] you're living Godly
[1:26:18] so all that living Godly in Christ oh
[1:26:21] what shall suffer persecution
[1:26:24] I think so anybody have a name
[1:26:29] [Music]
[1:26:38] it will never go down
[1:26:43] foreign
[1:26:45] [Music]
[1:26:58] [Music]
[1:27:07] it's been a long journey
[1:27:10] but there's an end to this down here
[1:27:12] [Music]
[1:27:21] at the sun it will never ever
[1:27:27] [Music]
[1:27:43] the flowers
[1:27:45] [Music]
[1:28:20] and the sun it will never go down
[1:28:26] hang on a minute
[1:28:30] go ahead
[1:28:32] um I'm gonna ask the church to be in
[1:28:34] prayer tomorrow morning at nine o'clock
[1:28:37] Wade and I hadn't talked at all about
[1:28:39] this but Jay and I are going to be in
[1:28:41] court about an eviction that we're we've
[1:28:45] got a a person that's been with us
[1:28:48] probably
[1:28:50] 15 16 years he's almost like family
[1:28:54] and he moved into one of our homes two
[1:28:58] years ago he was homeless and I gave him
[1:29:00] a place to live and all I asked him for
[1:29:02] was 40 hours work a month that's all I
[1:29:06] asked him for
[1:29:08] he since hasn't helped us since October
[1:29:11] when we needed the help most
[1:29:13] and um
[1:29:15] I've been patient and my Temperance have
[1:29:18] capital and check so I told him I was
[1:29:21] going to have to evict him and he said
[1:29:23] no you won't do that to me and I said
[1:29:25] I'm sorry about his business it's just
[1:29:28] life
[1:29:28] hope it's a life lesson for him and
[1:29:31] he'll turn his life around but the
[1:29:33] bottom line is
[1:29:35] we have two situations Happening Here
[1:29:39] one of the homes one of the other homes
[1:29:42] we have is halfway on
[1:29:44] one of the cousins family property so
[1:29:48] I've got to move a home in the next
[1:29:50] couple months or quicker if they did
[1:29:53] really challenge us and that's family
[1:29:55] challenging us so there's just a couple
[1:29:58] things going on on top of everything
[1:29:59] else it's a I want to be in prayer about
[1:30:02] but the main thing is
[1:30:05] what's hurtful about this whole thing is
[1:30:08] this guy
[1:30:10] I'm not asking for much just come we we
[1:30:12] barter all the time somebody getting a
[1:30:14] tight come clean my house come wash my
[1:30:17] car I'll barter with you I'll give you
[1:30:20] the farm and that's typically what I've
[1:30:22] done with this fella but just be in
[1:30:24] prayer because I know he's not going to
[1:30:26] have the right attitude and he thinks
[1:30:28] going tomorrow is going to save him
[1:30:29] because I've already given his first
[1:30:30] notice and the official notice in Hall
[1:30:33] County served him he thinks he's going
[1:30:35] to get around it but he's just going to
[1:30:37] have 10 days is always going to have
[1:30:40] but he was living in a hole in the
[1:30:42] ground when I took him in he dug a hole
[1:30:45] and lived there on some people's
[1:30:47] property he burned trash and leaves
[1:30:50] around their home and Burn It Down
[1:30:52] he was and since then he's been got
[1:30:55] married so it's a mess but
[1:30:59] I hurt because
[1:31:00] I know he's not going to be able to help
[1:31:02] himself but I've done all we can we've
[1:31:04] done all we're willing to do
[1:31:07] we were
[1:31:08] we got the bill for pops monthly Edition
[1:31:12] is seventy three hundred dollars a month
[1:31:15] I need that place for income and I'm
[1:31:17] gonna lose one
[1:31:18] in two months for income so it's kind of
[1:31:20] a trade-off not gaining anything but
[1:31:23] certainly it's just a bad situation
[1:31:25] but be in prayer because I like the guy
[1:31:28] I would help him still happen but I want
[1:31:31] to tell you
[1:31:32] I'm not the same person I used to be
[1:31:34] because I wouldn't have that temper be
[1:31:36] able to handle the temperance and
[1:31:38] patience of this no there's days that
[1:31:40] we've been in fist fights and years ago
[1:31:43] when we got into this a years ago but
[1:31:45] you know I've learned to be patient with
[1:31:47] people and just try to give them
[1:31:49] love them too just love them right you
[1:31:52] know
[1:31:53] but just being prayer at nine o'clock
[1:31:54] people okay
[1:31:58] um you know the Bible is pretty specific
[1:32:00] about taking somebody to court it
[1:32:02] doesn't say don't take anybody to court
[1:32:05] it just says don't take a brother to
[1:32:06] court I don't think they're dealing with
[1:32:08] a brother here
[1:32:10] um so uh you have to use the law
[1:32:13] because you know what if that guy though
[1:32:15] was a member of the church or he was or
[1:32:18] he was a good Christian guy who wouldn't
[1:32:19] be dealing with this
[1:32:22] okay but then you got to deal with it
[1:32:24] though if you deal with the public
[1:32:25] you've got to deal with those kind of
[1:32:26] people and don't let them run over you
[1:32:29] I mean I mean don't and I know Jesus
[1:32:31] said if you he wants your coat or your
[1:32:34] cloak giving me Coke too you can go as
[1:32:36] far as you need to
[1:32:38] but but but right right wrong wrong
[1:32:41] you let the you let the the authorities
[1:32:44] deal with that and and uh if you'll show
[1:32:47] a good attitude then that that guy will
[1:32:49] uh it never has been a good attitude to
[1:32:52] change your attitude when you get an
[1:32:54] attitude with somebody else's attitude
[1:32:56] okay I never will be able to say that
[1:32:58] again
[1:33:00] but do you understand what I'm saying
[1:33:03] if you have the same attitude they do
[1:33:05] you're gonna get the same results with
[1:33:07] them
[1:33:09] right but if you'll have a different
[1:33:11] attitude they won't know how to handle
[1:33:13] it and ninety percent of the time they
[1:33:16] they'll back off because they don't know
[1:33:17] how to have they want a confrontation
[1:33:19] the devil wants a confrontation with us
[1:33:22] but I thought the Bible says resist the
[1:33:24] devil he didn't say fight him
[1:33:27] he didn't say argue with him
[1:33:30] resist him
[1:33:32] just walk off
[1:33:33] walk away get away from it so we'll be
[1:33:36] praying for that in situations we have
[1:33:38] to go through let's bow our hands
[1:33:39] definitely father thank you for this
[1:33:41] evening
[1:33:42] Lord I pray that something's been said
[1:33:43] Lord that'll help us in life when we go
[1:33:46] home tomorrow and get up in the morning
[1:33:48] the world smacks Us in the face Lord
[1:33:50] we'll take it with a grain of salt and
[1:33:52] continue on knowing that this is not our
[1:33:56] home
[1:33:58] we're looking for a mansion
[1:34:01] that you've already built according to
[1:34:03] our desires
[1:34:07] very soon Lord
[1:34:09] very soon
[1:34:11] Lord thank you for the brothers and
[1:34:13] sisters that's assembled today and the
[1:34:15] ones that that attend this church Lord I
[1:34:17] pray that you'd bless them Lord
[1:34:19] take care of them Lord
[1:34:21] raise them up Lord and the statue of a
[1:34:24] perfect man Lord as we continue with
[1:34:25] this
[1:34:26] this study Lord that maybe it would it
[1:34:28] would change our thoughts a little bit
[1:34:30] about about being so weary and tired and
[1:34:33] and and and and seemingly insurmountable
[1:34:37] odds
[1:34:39] but Lord you're a God that takes those
[1:34:43] insurmountable odds and makes them
[1:34:47] surmountable one man
[1:34:50] a thousand people
[1:34:51] one man with an ox gold 600 people
[1:34:55] 600 trained soldiers
[1:34:57] with the power of God on them we'll now
[1:34:59] remember
[1:35:01] Lord we have the power of God in us
[1:35:04] not just an anointing that comes on us
[1:35:06] Lord and we we pray that we would
[1:35:08] cherish that cherish it every day that
[1:35:10] we live
[1:35:11] well Lord give you the praise and honor
[1:35:13] and glory be with the ones on the
[1:35:14] highways Lord as they travel back be
[1:35:16] with us Lord as we come to bible study
