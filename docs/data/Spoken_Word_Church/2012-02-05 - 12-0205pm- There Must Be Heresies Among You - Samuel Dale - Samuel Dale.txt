brother how back there with us him have him out with us today remember now the fellowship me meeting will be held here on the third Saturday in March at 3:30 so remember that there much be much in prayor and we'll get everything ready now I I'm just asking for I loan my master key to the church to somebody while they're here working on it and I wish you would let me know I'll give you another key back in place of it but the master key is easier to get locks you know keys made for locks somewhere I've loaned that to somebody or something and I can't find but now we have plenty of keys so we'll just loan it back we'll get it back to you if you just find my master key you tell the difference in the Masters and the others and all but just remember that okay uh to the men the other day we had to make a statement about the bathroom you know and I was laughing cuz I thought well we sure do our hour laundry out on the internet don't we uh the ladies bathroom got messed up a while ago and flooded downstairs so please ladies uh make sure you know that there's not too much paper in there when you flush it cuz if you get a lot of paper piled into it it come back up so you know try to help a little bit cuz see men it's not always that get on to you I get on to women too you know about you know doing it but we just a laundry all out on the world India right now her sister over there she called us every once in a while she's probably just Dy laughing right now talking about their commodes on the internet but we get it all done amen that's fine with us okay any other announcements I generally miss them I know Terence has made all the others about the the banquet and the different things and if you like turning your scriptures turn to First Corinthians 11 and 1 Peter 3 now forgive me this afternoon my tro been oh sinus has been hitting me for a couple of days and you just pray cuz I've been coughing like crazy and you know it's one of them things but just pray the Lord take care of it and get us where we can get our point across because we're going to we're going to be talking for a while I don't know how many services but we will be talking about some of the doctrines that are floating among the people of the message try to bring out their background of where they came from and express why we believe maybe something or why we don't believe some of the doctrines and things and you know and I say to those out there on internet or to anyone um first off if you have any questions when I speak about things uh don't write me and ask me a question who started this doctorine I I'm going to try to stay away from calling names cuz that wouldn't be proper but if you'll send me a personal note I will pray about sending you back a note on it you know to tell you who that uh but most of them when we call the doctor and most everybody will know who has got the doctrines and what they are but uh you know if you want anything if you got any questions about any of the doctrines that you want to be covered if you'll write me a note I'll try my best to cover it the best I can because I want to tell you why I don't agree with something I want to put it in the Bible I want to put it in the prophet's message not just get up and say what do you believe about to so don't believe it question number two that's no answer to nobody that won't cover anything is just you know cuz uh there are a lot of people that believe some of those doctrines that don't believe like the others believe you know even the founders and especially don't live and do like some of them have done but now you know to do uh and if you hear this I'm not your pastor I'm not pastoring the people on the internet system You Know It uh that's that's beyond where we can do and by by doing that then I'm not I'm only HonorBound to my people here that's right that I'm speaking about why I don't agree with these things and you go to your pastor and you ask him about this and see what he believes and and thingss and that's your choice you know to do but that's it 1 Corinthians 11 and 1 Peter 3 our heavenly father Our Savior Our Redeemer our All In All In Jesus is your name thank you for all of the things that you've done for us in our day day and hour that we're living thank you most of all for salvation in our souls thank you for the word that you've given unto us into our hearts that we may grow thereby and thank you for you coming Among Us in many ways of Healing The Sick and delivering and setting us free Lord we pray that you would just touch each one there's many sicknesses Among Us here today Lord and we read in your word where it said you sent your word and healed us and delivered us from destruction so all we're asking you to do is manifest your word have your way Lord if I say something here I will be trying to listen and make sure that I speak according to what I believe and why I believe it that way and if there's anything that's wrong Lord then you just count it to my ignorance cuz I don't I don't want to be and I don't want to be contrary to people I love everybody and I want everybody to to be helped and guided and Lord just let your love be there it's not that we've always been so straight and everybody else has been so wrong Lord but we've all been in a category put together that we're growing in you and we just ask you Lord to have your way now and guide us forgive our sins most of all and keep us in Jesus name amen 1 Corinthians 11 18 we go to verse 18 and 19 for first of all when you come together in the church I hear that there be divisions among you and I partly believe it now watch for there must be also hes among you why that they which are approved may be made manifest among you that's right all right now that's that's simple and plain isn't it there must need to be heresies there will be heresies there got to be because Satan will send them all right but what is to do the prophet said is to try us to see if we'll stay with the word right all right so you know it's wonderful for him to allow these things to happen but we don't say wonderful because of the people that is happening in no sir all right verse uh 1 Peter 3 and verse1 15 said but sanctify the Lord in your hearts and be ready always to give an answer to every man that ask you a reason of the hope that is in you with meekness and fear you may be seated the Lord at is bless ing to the reading of the word now we've done this over periods of time and things and we you know kind of felt like it the other day maybe praying some when we were out in in the Alabama hunting and didn't do much getting the deer but I could listen to a lot of tapes and just sat there for 3 or 4 hours morning 3 or 4 and afternoon you got a lot of times to meditate and you know to think on things and we've got some new Among Us that you know we can say well I don't believe in this well you know they want to know maybe why you don't believe in it because maybe they've been taught that and they might think it's true right all right and then uh the fact is that uh it always helps all of us to uh review in our minds and things about the the message to where that we can um feel assured that we have the right answer the Bible says examine yourself right to see whether you be in the faith or not all right so then the way to do that is by the word so then we're not picking on people right you know it is not the people that I'm against the prophet said it's the system or the fact of people taking those doctrines and ideas and they're honest hearted people that are in them and you know they have affected all of us I say that because a lot of times people don't really know when they say well I believe so and so and then when you express to them what that so and so amounts to well then they'll be like I was when brother Mo asked me what I believed and I said I believe in one true and living God I believe in God in three persons Blessed Trinity he said that's trinitarian so you know he straightened me out in a hurry well you know sometimes we have to tell what we believe before we can uh get helped right and that's the way it is and I've just always been blunt to do and I've studied all of these basics of the doctrines when it comes out because especially being Pastor you know that's being Pastor I believe that I'm Duty bound to know of these things so I've listened to some of the brothers and as many as 10 11 tapes or something like that from somebody and I don't listen you know where did he miss that where did he miss that quot know and I don't boy I'll straighten him out when see him I don't do that and I'm honest I've always tried to be that way I listen to see what they're saying right I listen more to the sincerity of their heart right right than I do anything else and I got some wonderful brothers friends out there that I count Brothers you know and and you know I don't disrespect them but I too want to take a stand for what I believe and tell you why I believe it that way in that way you know that would good and we just got to covering what is the new birth and and we went through so that can be uh added into this series if you'd like right as to you know there's a lot of controversy about the New Birth whether it's this whether it's that whether it's this that and I hope we tried to cover it enough to be able to at least tell you what we I believe and then you we can go from that point now you say but Brother D you say someone so beli it are the Lost no I didn't say that that's right right now if you putting that to my statements you're you're messing things up you know I said it you and all of us were messed up amen and we needed somebody to help us Y and you know the best thing to do the prophet of God said he said like I said about there must needs to be heres among you brother Rand said God would allow these things to come Among Us right that's right even send an anointing and even things would happen upon the you know the people has to try you and I to see whether or not we're in the faith well so they must needs be it's not that they might be or maybe they will it's it must be in other words it's going to be amen God knew before the world that he was going to allow these things to take place and even honor them to the basis of sending healings and signs and I've always told you this much I believe it now I believe when the this thing winds down that according to the prophet he said God will anoint a church right and he'll do in one year what theologist tried to do in 2000 but said he's doing it now all right now I believe that when the anointing strikes home to the Bride of that final quickening to go away of the bride all right I believe all of those that out there that are under doctrines and things that that there'll be an anointing strike them and they'll be saying I tried to tell you I right yeah y I'm sorry I believe that he said well what hope does that give me that gives us only hope in one thing right whether or not we do like I've tried to preach this morning whether or not the spirit in US agrees with the word whether or not we can believe the word not what somebody said the word said now what somebody said brother random said yes but whether or not the spirit in us can agree because that's always been the evidence to each Church age that said he that hear Let Him hear what the spirit sath unto the churches so it's always been the hearing by the Holy Spirit even the day of Pentecost was the hearing yes like I said this morning you got him in the upper room it doesn't mention it mentions what took place there but then you got to separated the prophet did when they were outside and the 3,000 heard them that was quite a time even if it' been 5 minutes it was the time right and these out here is hearing them speaking tongues so then you know separated in the right order I believe in speaking in G amen I believe in all the manifestations of God shouting seeing visions dreams prophecies all in if it's in God I believe in cuz I believe in the nine spiritual gifts right but I believe the gifts without the virtue the prophet said is a stumbling block right all right so I don't want to be in a stumbling block position I want to be ready against that day okay now Paul found in his day you know the time that he was here doctrines that he did not agree with and and he had to approach that subject I'm not making ourselves or anything like that in where Paul was but just making us the pastor or Shepherd of the flock right that you know we don't have the ability and I wouldn't want the ability but see Paul had the ability according to 1 Corinthians 1513 that some said there's no Resurrection well he had the ability to call them men in and he had ability to release them to the Lord right you know he done that to Philipus and hus I believe the two names are you know why because they were saying what they thought he said right that's it and that's how simple it is to be in heresy Paul was teaching a phys a spiritual Resurrection inside of us rais sitting together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus Philipus and hus took it over to the Natural and said the resurrection done took place right now they took it from Paul right so Paul had the ability or the authority to call in those brothers and do that now because he was the messenger of that time all right now now we're not we're not concerned about it I'm not wanting to you know call in somebody and say bless God will just commit all them to the devil no we're not going to do nothing we're just going to try to cover doctrines and say okay this is why we don't agree with it right and then just going down the road you know and things of that order and there's wonderful brothers like I've said that you know are are out there that are called in doctrines right you know and just you know just pray for them that's all do all right we'll start off with one of the oldest major doctrines and we'll try to cover some of the things this was one of the major ones that you would a lot of you would be Associated into the time it was called Two Souls all right it was started by a man up here and accredited two or three different ones but there's only one man that really started it and and I say this folks listen just because somebody comes along and said they believe in Two Souls uh they might not believe it the way that yeah the originator started it and especially they would not live the way he did because he wound up with young girls and everything in the world you know uh messed up all right but that's between him and the Lord on his part but a lot of people are caught in doctrines that really don't realize that they they believe that righten yep that's right and then when you say something they say well that's what I believed then you say well now this is why that we don't agree with it well then you go off and puff up you you know get yourself all PFI and everything else and go off mad because you think somebody straightened you out well thank God for the truth there was a dumb donkey straightened the prophet out one day and I imagine that old Prophet from then on felt pretty good about that old boy he probably fed a little extra and took care of him because he realized he saved his life you know all right so you know we could maybe we could do that but many years ago there was a man started a Doctrine and called Two Souls knew the man personally sat down talked with him and just told him that I couldn't see what he's talking about and uh you know but there's many flings off from that Doctrine right and the reason I'm using this one is because you will see that once we cover this Doctrine we can go into other doctrines of the message people and you'll see that they have the same basis it's like all denominations it's got the basis of the Trinity all right then you come over to the Oneness side then all the Oneness has got the basis of the Oneness Doctrine you agree you know that's just the what they are and like we were're talking the other day I think brother Donnie and I were talking about it but uh a man used to go to church with us here he he was in a Baptist Church and he he he asked the pastor one day something about you know what did the Baptist believe and the old preacher which he was a personal friend of mine I worked with him but he uh he said well I'm going to teach him the Baptist Doctrine and he for two or 3 weeks he took the doctrine of the Baptist Church you know and explained it to the congregation but when before he started he said how many here understand the Baptist Doctrine but and agree with it would this maybe a few hands went up you know he said well I'm going to just take the Baptist doctorine and explain it so he took two or 3 weeks to explain it when he got through he said how many here raise your hand believe what the Baptist Doctrine there was less than what there was to start with that raised their hands because they didn't really know what it was and you know yourself that unless you you know were something trying to maybe approve PR or something that you didn't know the doctrine of the church you come from right you just went to church well see it's easy to do that in the message people yes sir just go to a church find a good bunch of people and and you know and just sat down and well what do we believe we were going to a u a fellowship meeting one time and this sister and brother was with us and and she turned around to her husband and since i' said something and she's turned around to the husband and she said something about do we agree with that he said no we didn't believe it that way she thought she did just because I said it you know you say predestination a presbyterian rais his hand badst cuz they believed in that but what are all of the problems and the things of explaining it may come out to a lot of different things all right but with all that doing now here's what I believe and I'm tell to my conclusion and I did listen to these if I tell you I listen to them you can back on I did but if I didn't never do it then I'll tell you I never listened to that but I've heard what other people said right all right but see like I said I met the man personally and brother collie brother Dy met him and uh you know sat down and listen to him talk about the things and uh as as it was doing they begin to explain you know that you had two Souls all right now the basic teaching of Two Souls is that if you were able to be redeemed see a lot of you probably heard two soul doctr but don't even know what in the world it was or whatever the basics of the doctrine was that if you were able to be redeemed if you would ever be redeemed you had two Souls but if you were not going to be ever redeemed you only had one now and the doctrine was that if you had the two Souls if you had the one Soul it' come from Satan see you see his children then that would go into the serpent seeds and the doctrinal isues and that's what it said all slings off of different things of people believing it all right but see then they would say that if you were able to be redeemed or a seed you know predestinated person you had two souls and they said one of them come from God the other one come from the devil and that was why it was called Two Souls but that's the basis now that they believed you if you were redeemable you had two Souls if you wouldn't redeemable you never had but one cuz you just come from the devil and that was it all right now the one reason I don't and is what I told him according to Ezekiel 18 for the Lord says All Souls are mine the soul that's sth it shall die right amen all right now if Satan can give you a soul now we're going to get into this nature in a minute so then just bear with me of what people are saying about it you know well I'm not really talking about I'm talking about the nature of that you know well we'll get to that in a second yeah all right but see Satan cannot create that's right amen okay go ahead brothers and pull up some of these things and we'll read some points and I will try to give them to you if I can as we go along but the main issue is to show you that Satan cannot create to show you brother around said that right well then if he can't create how can he give you a soul right no no that's what I'm saying hang on to your nature part hang on to you you know to the part about the the nature till we get down to where brother R says the nature of your soul is God if you're bornn again if it's nonsense of the world right and I had a two soul man tell me he said how can a nature have a nature I said you go argue with brother brandom I didn't make the statement that's what I told stand in Jeffersonville Indiana because you know I was just I just gave you what brother ROM had to say about it right all right so we gave the scripture now that all souls are mine now there's nowhere in the Bible that you can find that Satan can create you can I want the scripture you say well he creates Havoc he creates Z all he perverts amen right that's where his problem is he is not does not have the ability to create you see what he creates wrong he had to be allowed to do that right he said when he creates Havoc or heresies or doctrines he had to be allowed to do that right he cannot create he can do all the other things but he can't create that's the one thing your profit holds that Satan can't do is he cannot create so look what he says all right on the questions and answers in 54 so we'll go from here and then we'll go to 65 see to make sure you know it's before the after the seal doctrine of people we'll get to that eventually iew 54 10 10 103 the morning service paragraph 137 he had a question today brother Bill the Bible said it e said I got the son from The Lord exactly right it had to come from the Lord the Lord's only Creator there is he God created the devil how's that God created the devil God created every Fallen Angel there is is that right my certainly that was their choice not his he created you what are you doing about it you'll be judged the same as they you'll be judged as same as they are there you are certainly all right so God even created the Devil he's the only Creator amen there's no other Creator see God's the only one okay number two God's power transformation 65 911 paragraph 42 he's the only Creator there is there is no other Creator but God Satan cannot create at all he only perverts what's been created God is the only Creator and he says he goes on about his word h going down to the next one while we add it 64-8 identifications paragraph 74 so much still he was the word in full the word of God flowed through him so freely that even he could speak a word and it would create see that showed who he was who can create but God see God is the only Creator there is go down to the next we we'll get this reading out of the way uh the queen of Shea E28 1961 to19 the devil cannot create the devil only perverts what God's created there's only one Creator that's God what is a lie it's a truth Mis represented what is a bad woman it's a good woman that's been perverted see anything that is perverted is of the devil right anything in it's original condition is of god see God is the only Creator and the devil cannot create he has to pervert what God has created keep that in your mind all right now so he cannot create so if you say Satan gave you soul and God gave you a soul you're making Satan a Creator right CU see they didn't teach it now you'd say well the way I'd say that they didn't teach what you said about it they said Satan gave you a soul so we read now that he can't give you a soul right but he can pervert right he can pervert whatever God makes right but he cannot create it so if you make him a Creator you you're battling against things and and you run a ground on on a lot of points all right now you say but brother Dale they were only teaching that the soul is the nature of the spirit I agree that's what they done but they really didn't say that the original one that taught it said it this way quote the nature is just the soul is just the nature of the spirit now I want a quote from Brother Brown that's why brother colag and brother Dy can verify that they would the man said something down there us about brother said so and so he told us to raise your hand and I raised my hand he said what Brother D I said brother didn't say that yes he did well there's another brother sitting right there beside of he said brother they righty it brother said Amen brother didn't say that and he said okay I'll say it I said we'll continue if you want to say you said it go ahead and what you're doing just don't say to these here that are sitting here that brother brandham said this I'm just going to tell you he didn't say it see if you say the soul is just the nature of the spirit Lo in then you're locking it to one thing and you're making it nothing right exactly yep yep so you're making the soul nothing but it's just the nature of it right then that wouldn't work right now brother Rand go ahead with number five brother on the token and listen to what he says here and it'll come close cuz he'll actually make the statement now the animal life could not come back to the human because they wouldn't match the animal life has no soul in it the human life has a soul the animal doesn't know he is naked he doesn't know right from wrong he he just he has a spirit but not a soul remember now the soul is the nature of the spirit of course right all right now so then if you're just saying it's the nature of something you're not seeing what a real soul is that's right and that's what's wrong with the people when that Doctrine started they were arguing and fussing over it and it really worked out good for me you know why because I began to consider and study what is a soul they talking about how many you had I was trying to figure out what a soul was and I went to a certain brother's church and preached that that God is a have a soul right and the brother he didn't like it to begin with right y because he he didn't see what I was talking about right so he differed with me till he went to somebody else and said to that brother said you know brother Dale says that God is a soul the brother said he's exactly right right do he went back home and study thank God he run into the right person all right all right now just forgive me for coughing you clear your throat I do okay but now what is a soul if you're going to talk about two Souls there you what is a soul amen you know you know the soul is the most important thing about you amen that's right yes it is the only part yep that has eternal life yep that's right you know by the new birth got it's the only part of you that has eternal life we've been through that on the new birth okay so now the soul is not just a nature of something just to no see a dog has a nature right you take a bird dog you don't have to train a bird dog Point Birds some unknown reason he'll just spread out he'll point it to birds of course he may point it to dogs and the cats and the horses and he may point at everything you got to train him about the birds all right but that's his nature of him you know see then the animals can have those form of nature but they don't have a soul all right see that soul of you is actually your being right it's the only part while we're in this world that God can make Eternal right amen we're going to have to go through a change of this body and spirit to be able to talk about eternal life in body and spirit right you say yeah but brother Dale I got all these quotes yes you have and brother brandom from the beginning where he was at now listen to my words listen out there to my words on most every do way that he would teach up until about 62 on the greatest battle ever fought up until that time he would basically cover the three reals of man and he'd say Body Soul Spirit he would make the spirit the center real okay now that is a doctrine of mankind and brother ROM followed it cuz he was basically following it from a scientifical side to looking at what people were saying I ran into a group of people before I heard of this message that said you did not have a soul until the law came that's what they T I asked the man said but according to Genesis God BR in about 27 God BR in the nost of Adam he become a living Soul he said I never thought of that he was up he was teaching a class at work out there about it but see that was their Doctrine they believe when the law came it brought you a knowledge of sin see that would bring you a soul no Adam according to my Bible was a created man right Body Spirit and soul right all right now follow me and don't don't turn me off at least you hear the end of this point all right cuz I've been it here with the people a lot but you out there maybe hadn't heard the point but see like I said basically brother around now he would interace soul in spirit he would speak so in spirit and drop it backwards and forth he would have the soul in the center and the spirit in the outer and then he would have the the spirit as the center the soul in the outer y all right until he comes up to about 62 the greatest battle ever fought is about the best time that he start hearts and you can see in that that he's going this way and all at once he lined it up because according to the Bible that you know that you would even understand by the opening of the word Hebrews 4:12 you would be able to discern between the joint neir and the soul and the spirit so when the scripture begin to open to the prophet then he always taught it Body Spirit Soul okay now I said saying he interlaced him in the older the early Ministry of the soul is the center the spirit is the outside and the spirit is the center the soul is outside but here's one thing you say well why didn't he straighten that out you know why can't we find a tape where brother Brown said I was wrong here because he was not wrong he was lacking of understanding right the reason he wasn't wrong look he always gave three rims of man he always gave the senses of those Realms body was body was see taste feel smell and hear right right second realm of man whatever you want to call it is memory reason conscience affection what imagination all right the cerim of man he always taught was either one of the two things not two thing one of the two it was either Faith or doubt amen was in the soul you know the sinner so he had it right so if you look at what I'm talking about when you're reading or hearing the early Tes and you're listening to it and he said see there the the spirit of man is the center of man watch him he'll say the soul has got memory reason conscious affections right see he had his Doctrine right it was just just is wording right all right now I'm going to show you something if you'll do it you I'm I'm asking you especially the the Learned Scholars that may be listening preachers you cannot go in we in uh Strong's Concordance run it in on your computer run spirit and run Soul it's interrelation word it's so close to the same until they do not differ between right they do not differ in the fact of spirit whether it is the Holy Spirit right or whether it is man's spirit because they were not capable of being able to distinguish right but the before and the after of the thought tells you which one is right it tells you if it's talking about man's Spirit read the before of it and after you'll see if it's talking about man Spirit or talkinging about the Holy Spirit see then that way it's simple for you to see it all right see now to do that then what is a soul what do you want to call it Spirit what what is that Center real that has the one sense of Faith or doubt that's the real you Soul means being it means spirit means person y all right now to show you when the prophet needed it to be and come into understanding God gave it because the scripture doesn't say the spirit that sent us shall die right amen say that right said the soul that sin us shall die y amen see so then the prophet had to line with the scriptures so when he got into the 62 and the last part of it there there you can see from then on he would always say Body Spirit Soul well because God was unveiling the word as I said Hebrews uh 412 I think it is this sharper the two-edged sword dividing between joint and Mar and between the soul and the spirit all right now that's not how smart I am that's how God can speak to you right cuz I was just like everybody else when I read it I wondered why he made these statements and made them statements and I was simply praying one day about it and the Lord spoke to me and said see he never changed the senses right he only changed the wording right amen not the senses all right there's always five senses to the body always five senses to the second real whether he called it Spirit or Soul always one sense to the a real whether he would call it soully Spirit it was the same and that's what I told those Brothers in I said Brothers you don't understand I said if you got two Souls you got two persons in you right right now you'll see that these doctrines will inter Rel of the people of the message because when you get to the two Lords you're going to see the same point right yep you get to the doctrine of the two Lords you're going to see that it actually come from the two Soul Doctrine right you've got what you call the change of the soul that is a big part of the doctrine that flew off from the two Souls you got what you call the exchange of the soul and you got all of those things and what the man that taught the two Soul part of it was he said if you're born again in other words if you're capable of being saved God comes down and destroys the old soul now listen to this is of what I'm saying because this is what the man talk that you destroyed the old God would destroy the soul that come from Satan and he said the one that come from God never did need anything it always was eternal yeah now you see all these doctrines coming out of the people the message oh yeah about eternity y they have in their basic back there with that Doctrine right I've told you here about it and you know it that I had an opportunity to talk with a Mormon and he was a pretty good rank of a Mormon and uh cuz they have different ranks he was a male Chic rank which he was close to capability all Mormons cannot have more than one wife it is not meant that everybody can have more than one wife in the Mormon it is meant only those who can afford them and those who have the rank capable of being that which was basically if you want to call him priest yeah all right now that's Mormon Doctrine it's okay now but I talked to this man for about for 8 hours I asked him to explain the Mormon Doctrine when he finished at the end of that 8 hours I could lay his name or this brother's name right down over his and they were saying the same thing so you say you got a soul from from Satan the Mormon Doctrine is that everybody's up in heaven everybody everybody ever be in the world was up in heaven all right we were talking about how that we could um come to Earth be lost or something and and uh honor our Father by salvation and whatever you know and the doctrine was that Satan now listen Satan wanted to save everybody in the world Lucifer the anointed cherub you know they knew the story it was kind of funny when it started off with a man he said if you knew about prophets that's what he said he said if you just knew a little bit about prophets he said you and I could talk I said continue brother we can talk but anyhow they prophets come up with these ideas and they can change the Bible and do what they want to you know and different things or the polygamy came in and then they come over and wrote another rule it it's not right and it didn't stop most of them from being polygamist but anyhow the doctrine is that Satan wanted to save everybody but Jesus just wanted to save a few people or certain amount now that shows you right off to start with that something's messed up right cuz Satan save everybody and Jesus only want to save so many but that's their Doctrine now you go find one talk to him just ask him to explain it to you and Satan got mad because Lucifer you know he wasn't Satan then he wasn't the devil he was the anointed cherub and he got upset and he came to Earth as being mad and that's why the battle has been going on ever since all right now they believe the Mormons believe that ever so often God empowers a certain person with the ability to be a prophet and that he can speak to the people and that's why they change as they go along you know and different things but see what would be the difference in the doctrine of the Mormon then and the doctrine of the people of the message to believe in Two Souls because they would believe that Satan give you a soul y well he can't give you a soul that make him a Creator right amen cuz a soul is is real right amen amen your soul is whole whole lot more real than your body right man this thing we beat on here we call it wood that's nothing that just destroys with ashes you know that's burned up but there's no way that you can burn up the soul right amen God is the only one that can destroy a soul amen right as I said while I go it does not say the spirit that's in it it shall die it says the soul that's in it shall die right all right meaning the real you the real you is that Soul within you right the spirit real we've covered that the spirit real is in your memory imagination and stuff and it Satan can penetrate that and just cause all kind of Havoc within you yes in all right and then your body is nothing without the spirit the Bible said so it just displays what the spirit within us is doing with that real soul in there sealed in amen so then that man in the Hebrew book that was a preacher I think and he went out and got him some beer sat down said he wasn't going to preach no more wasn't going to do it you know a couple weeks later he died right brother brandom said God would not let him Mar his name he took his child home right so you see people out here just living like the devil and they say well I was saved at one time now something wrong there I don't I can't follow that line of thought I've got to to be a different but now get to point that Judas is cared was a human soul amen right uh Cain Cain in the Genesis was a living Soul amen that's right cuz when a baby comes forth God breathes into its nostrils and it becomes a living soul and as I've expressed to you before I'm glad the prophet explained that because that doesn't mean that these babies that have to be aborted or different things they're not living Souls right you'll argue that point that's all right you'll argue they can cry so does an animal cry in the mother's room you can argue that pain will inflict it'll do it to an animal see it's not that it's not a living Soul until it comes forth right right CU brother brand said he's waiting he said that more one said she's she's kind of arrogant and hateful and said said all at once right around the time the baby b this get this sweet this around her he said that's that little body waiting on that baby to drop that little soul to go into that baby when the baby comes forth God gives you the soul Satan cannot create but the minute that Soul comes into that baby and the little baby can't see nothing blurred hardly but he's still he's got all of the mov and he looks around down and here's two nurses and one of them saying well look at that blankety blank little baby laying there you know said You know here we had a good night going until three babies were born and we going to have to work all night the poor little kid that's he starts off from that's where Satan starts perverting our nature right God cannot give us a soul that is not good right he cannot create an evil Soul right he's not the author of evil things right amen oh but brother Dale I got the scripture where it says God knows good and evil yes he knows good and evil right right he knows of it but he don't allow it right there's no part of him it can come from he just knows of it all right now following the point then that soul is the real you that soul is the real you right amen and that's what God starts working on read black read uh souls in prison and you'll understand a lot what the prophet is saying about it all right go ahead and pull that quote up brothers let's just look at cuz look what brother Brown said number six this is taking souls in prison 63 11:10 morning service paragraph 36 when he said we are dead the scripture plainly tells us that we are dead and our lives are HID in God through Christ sealed there by the Holy Spirit now it wasn't that your body died now he's talking about when you're getting born again right now watch it wasn't your excuse it wasn't that your body died it wasn't your spirit died it was the nature of your spirit died that's why Ezekiel said I give you a new heart and new spirit so you couldn't stand yourself with that other Spirit you have all right see the nature which is the soul right whatever the spirit is is motivated by the soul right whatever the body is is motivated by the spirit right see the nature of your soul is is God if you're born again if not it's of the world now that's as plain as you can be the nature of your soul is God if you're born again if it's not see wasn't your your body that died when you get a new birth it wasn't your spirit that died right and when he said I give you a new heart and a new spirit did he take out the spirit you have Spirit you standing here go by Spirit then God has to reach in get that Spirit rip it out put in another Spirit no no he just works on the nature of the thing right you know what the nature of the thing comes from the inward part of you right so what I've been trying to explain on on sanctification justification just Toops off the p of the Soul sanctification starts what cleansing and setting aside a place right in the soul for God to live then the new birth is a life place within there so then it comes out to be that that Soul then displays what nature it is out through the spirit and the spirit out through the body and you can see what the person is right because of that doing but but the soul is the real you all right now to show you John 12:27 now these are just scripture so I'll just quote them to you Jesus when they were fixing to place him on the no that was when he was in the uh there at the park said now is my soul troubled right y don't we got soul amen and I don't like to say he had a soul I like to say he is a soul right so I don't like to say that you got a soul you are a soul amen amen so you're a soul you're a spirit and you're a body it's not you have one because that would mean that you got something here and you have to keep putting over into there to make it work out and that's why I didn't agree with him when they said the soul is just the nature of the spirit see this means it's nothing right it's just nothing it's nothing when I knew what the Bible had to say about it all right what about the psalmist David that said in Psalm 42 and2 my soul thirth after thee amen there's a lot of that in the psalmist about him thirsting his soul right now what is the second death first death you die go to the Grave what is the second death it's the death of the Soul according to Revelations 20 14 and 15 every soul is going to die that's not born again amen or given eternal life going to be destroyed amen Every Soul so it's the soul that's in us when when you die naturally what happens the soul leaves the body now I know what the Bible says about about the spirit go back to God who gave it that's that's a hard thing to comprehend but it is scriptural but still I can't see that it goes and attaches itself back to him right so that means your spirit is not really real you no that's right it's not the real you your spirit is not that's right your soul is the real you so you don't have to deal with where it goes the spirit you don't have to deal with where that part go you deal with where the soul goes and when brother Brown went beond the curtain of time even the angel of the Lord called it Souls under the alt amen cuz he seen the people there in Soul when he said Jesus Christ that now you need all these I can sply for you okay 40 years teaching in order to be able to without the computer but thank God for them but see that Soul when you die it either it's going downward to a place to abide or it's going upward that's right amen it's either going to a place of Abode like beyond the curtain of time or it's going to what we call hail goana sh Hades etc etc we know all of the wordings it's going to the place of the lost if you're not born again you're born again it's going into the dimensions of God right now like we could spend a long time cuz we have that a foolish virgin wouldn't be going to hell their soul wouldn't but so there must be another place that can abide until time can be but for them to be given eternal life so we've been through that but now the main point I'm W you to see Jesus's soul went to hell that's what brother Brown said he went and preached to the spirits that were in prison brother Brown said it was the souls that was in prison the Bible calls it Spirits in in prison he said Souls that were in prison and Jesus's soul went down to them and he testified to him he was a person right amen he wasn't a myth or a fog it floated to hell and they looked around no he was standing down all right the same one standing down there was the same one standing up here that brother Ram said when he appeared to Abraham right as mdic that's right amen that man standing there was God that's right soul in that body that you look at righten he said it was the same one that Moses saw the back part said he saw the theophany right the theophany is the soul no brother we got doct about the theophany we going to it that's where you're messed up we'll cover that docto amen it's not you going somewhere I thought God supposed to come here right I don't know we'll pray J the Hebrew Book brother said your soul you theop argue with him right but listen see the Bible says Matthew um got to be 1028 let me look at this one got to be 1028 or 1228 so I have to look see which one it is cuz I made a circle around it 1028 oh yeah and if you're not being which kill the body but are not able to kill the soul but rather fear him which is able to destroy both soul and Body in hell that's right so the Bible's plain about the soul all right so then in doing that brother Bram calls it on the message of samon church age of the death of the Soul go ahead and pull that up brother number seven the first day is separated from your loved one separating from your loved one we're gone in the presence of God never out of his presence now if there's a second death then it had to be the death of the soul and then he that overcomes the world or overcomes the thing of the world has eternal life and shall not be touched by the second death all right going on to number eight that was part page the paragraph 150 this is paragraph 49 now there's one death that we know about it there's got to be another death somewhere else because death we die is here in the flesh the second death we die in the spirit the soul it's the soul that Sinn us shall surely die that's 1960 1207 pergent age uh and he goes down but a Christian does not die there's no scripture that a Christian dies because he's got eternal life when a sinner dies he's finished and his soul will finally die cuz the soul is a last destruction huh yep but when a Christian dies he's just waiting with Jes Jesus to return back again see even a sinner is still alive somewhere in his soul right waiting for the day of the Judgment then at the day of judgment it can come forth to the basis of let me make sure I don't cover too far cuz I inter relate I ain't going to do it cuz I'm going just hold it all right now I want to ask you a simple point if it's your spirit is the center realm of you then look what you be dealing with because we just got through covering and we talked a good bit about well Jesus said the unclean Spirit goeth out of a man let the unclean Spirit goeth out of a man right are you listening if the unclean Spirit goth out of the man and the Soul was not the real you why would you need a new birth right if the unclean Spirit has gone out of you and that's all you need is the unclean Spirit to be gone out of you then you don't need a new birth well see that's what they taught you didn't need a new birth because you always was eternal you see they made it the spirit of you that was eternal right and the Soul was just the nature of the spirit okay see that's what they made the soul just be the nature of the and the spirit's a real you see where they missed it at the soul is a real you amen and think of all the way around the world I run into that in in the Philippines and they had the wrong brother and Tack to the name of it and they had really been and you just think and you think about that we sent money to a lot of these places for them to be able to print books and to do things to help them and those brothers were at the mercy of those men that came over there with quotes until they begin to get a few books of their own they could not argue with him about whether it was two souls or what it was and the man went over there maybe not himself personally because they thought the other man was ahead of it it really inflicted a lot of damage in the island and a lot of things throughout the philes was messed up on C that ran into it in Brazil that it has a lot of thought following around the world still today about the two Soul Doctrine in one form or the other is still inflicting damage around the world you know and they're still talking about and that's what I said this morning whether you caught it or not that don't cabbage down if brother Dale dies and gone off the scene don't cabbage down and say we got what is it we got brother Dale's word you get God to speak to you that's right amen because that's what they had they didn't have nothing else they just had what a man said and even after he went off in polygamy and everything else and I read the books where he said that he was teaching that you can have the polygamy was this great Secret Under the seventh seal you had never heard me say this one we were talking Brother Gary he listening on TV laughing cuz we were talking in rym one day and I was telling them that's what the brothers believe that the great mystery under the seventh seal was polygamy that you could have more than one wife Sister Margaret G's first wife she's a very quiet person she didn't say a lot you know well she did spoke you know speak you listen but she didn't say a lot she looked across the table and said if Brother Gary can get the Revelation that polygamy is okay under the seventh seal she said I can get the Revelation and I'll take my 357 and blow his head off she wasn't laughing and I said sister I agree with you you know that's the great mystery see the mystery of the two Soul was and brought it on into polygamy was that you see the hen and you see the rooster you see the buck deer and all of the do you see all of the things they went through and it's still just going all over the world trying to show you it's okay brother around said polygamy is wrong that's from Daniel 70 weeks you want to look it up the polygamy is wrong today we're not dealing no more with one David and thousand wives we're dealing about a man and wife being a type of Christ in the church see you get into one thing and it goes all the way into another one but now listen if you caught the point I was saying there a minute ago that why did Jesus have to die if the unclean Spirit go could go out of you yeah see then you wouldn't need him dying you just needed him driving it out that's right but he had to Die Why right not to get the spirit to go out of you right are you listening the unclean Spirit went out right them disciples was clean when they went to that upper run right they were clean through the word that was spoken to them they were Sanctified in St John 17 but see they didn't have eternal life right cuz eternal life was in that soul that was in that man brother around said this is a quote if you want it he said and God ripped out of the body of Jesus that soul and said it came back the spirit that's the way it said the spirit of God came back on the day Pentecost in the form of the baptism of the Holy Ghost in the soul amen running soul of God into your computers and look what you'll get amen cuz you see the only way you can have eternal life is for soul to soul body to body he's my brother right that right Y come on now body to body Jesus is just my brother you now you say just that's going to confuse a lot of people just get get my point body to body we're we're brothers y Spirit to Spirit we can talk in a real higher soul to soul makes me a child of God see there must needs to be heresies among you if you'll take it and study it out yeah and get into the right thing then you'll see that Adam became a living soul and God breathed the breath of life into his nostrils he became a living Soul why does it say that according to Blasphemous names Adam was a man moving around and then God breathed into his nostrils eternal life right especially in the Adam was given God's Own eternal life what is it that Wade loves so much about Genesis 1116 and 17 I mean 26 27 why because that's only one person that's right that's only one man that man was created what not created but stepped over into another form and come down right into that body that's my brother amen and lived in that body one day was removed from that he went to hell and preached to the souls that were down in hell then he came back back into that body stepped back in it raised that body up 18 19 20 years old yep went up and then he comes back on the day of Pentecost right the soul of God Amen do you say what I I don't know where I believe in two souls or not well how can you have two Souls if you got two Souls you got a problem that's right I got enough trouble with the one I got right act like having two wives who would want two wives amen that's right lust would be the only form that you wanted in and then why did these men like the man that started this doctorine want all these little young girls he was probably he was older than I am and at that time which has been 10 years ago I was give a take a little bit off or something he was somewhere in his 60s and why would he want young girls if he wanted more than one wife why didn't he find any more 60 year old women they could all sit around and and crack pecans and and take it time about cooking and washing and but it don't never work that way does it man don't never want a wife older than he is you know like that especially if he's 60 he don't want a 70 year old woman he be about like that guy was that got up and this man got they prophesied in the church and said there's a there's a you know he prophesied and said there's a I'm supposed to go to Italy or somewhere you know and said there's a young woman in this building the Lord told me he supposed to go there with me I'm a missionary this 70y old woman got up walked up there and she said Lord spoke to me and told me to go with you he said hold on just a minute he said the Lord just spoke to me and told me to stay where I'm at so change things it ain't funny that's right but it is that's right it's funny how maned people are right that's right you can live out of a bottle all you want to whether it's blue or whether it's pink or whatever you want to right you can have operations you can have anything you want to you're going to get older that's right and you know what in this Bible what I love it cuz it's plain you know that David having all them wives now you believe this is in the Bible he got old worn out well they wanted to see if they could R revive him up plain language let's talk okay where they'll understand that on the internet but go in your Bible read it they give him a young virgin as a wife to try to revive him up but they found out it didn't work too far gone okay listen folks we are nothing but a garbage can but God show chose to save us right amen that's right place eternal life within our soul amen that's right he gave us that Soul at Birth and Satan perverted it the nature part of it working through our spirit he got to work upon us but one day God came down and he gave birth to that Soul amen did that solve all the problems no God knew we'd need it so there must needs to be heresies among you there must be doctrines come among us to see if we were going to believe the truth and stay with it now you can say well now I don't agree and I I wrote that in my notes here a lot of the people that followed Theo did not agree with the man that started Theo when he went into polygamy they didn't agree with him they were good people they didn't agree with it right but you still still they took the same Doctrine and trying to make the two Souls out of it right and when you do you're trying to soulmate with something and brother rown said I don't believe in soulmate you're trying to match up things and he started a doctrine that would later turn out to be and maybe we won't cover them but it would turn out to be a groups would call it the chain of the Soul Y and then some would label it even the exchange God taking this out putting that in I've never believ God took anything out like that he just takes what you are and works on it when he gives you a new heart and a new spirit it doesn't mean that he takes your spirit out see that would lose all your memories your reasons your conscience and things would go over that and then what would you be you'd start a baby over you you wouldn't have no memories or nothing he doesn't do that he works on the nature of that thing he works on that Spirit from the inside by the new birth right then he he can bring that Spirit into subjection right to make the body do what he wanted it to do right see then that's what God began to deal with me about it to show me and I'll try to show you each Doctrine as we go along if I can remember it as well and then we'll say we see where this year went over that helped us to see this right because it was necessary that those things come Among Us God wanted to try us he loves to try you brother R said he loves to see whether or not you'll stay with the word he put everything in the world in your face to make it look good I told you about it I don't mind telling everything cuz I'm just feel I wrote notes on something one time that I was intending to preach and I had about five pages of quotes Bibles everything and you know the way I preach now I would challenge anybody to come show me if I'm wrong and I was sitting there and I said Lord it looks like that's a pretty good point I don't know where to bring it out or not but it's a pretty good thing and this is all he said he said if you make that he said you make your type greater than your antitype it didn't take me a week to figure that out if you make a typ of something a boat is the type of a ship right right so if you swap places with want you go you got the big old boat first little boat Li that wouldn't work out that's not the way you're going see see if you make anything greater about D you know say David and his thousand wives are the top of the Bride In Christ right but if you stay on that where are you at right you got a problem so you had to come to Christ in the church right don't make your tip greater than your anti I shed those notes and burn them I didn't want nobody to ever see it in my wife or anybody I never discussed it with anybody because I seen it was wrong right I thank God that he could speak to me amen but you know where he spoke to me from right out of the word you make your tight greater than your ant attip I said Thank You Lord because see I don't want anything like that I want to see the real right yes and you don't say thank God for the herries that's come Among Us that's not the attitude because somebody's got to bring them and lo and behold look at who they you think Judas wanted to be what he was I don't go that way he was a mortal human being but the devil entered into him the Bible said and he went out and sold the Lord Jesus the devil has got in these people and even given them signs and wonders sure what if you ask God for a sign and it comes to pass one scripture said if a prophet gives you a sign of thing that comes to P believe that Prophet because I am with him everybody wants to believe it so every little Fly by Night preacher come along got some kind of a gift you see where brother Brom then would say it was wrong and they start running and they said the Lord showed me this one man showed said I heard him he said I saw Africa burning on fire and he said I'm going there and it's going to be a great Revival of Africa well as far as I know today when I we went to Africa yeah now if the Lord showed me that I'd go to Africa right wouldn't you see that would be the point and I just jump up and take off but see that wouldn't that wouldn't be the form that You' want it to be in cuz you have to try that by the word see there never will be another worldwide sweeping Revival so somebody come along preach there going to be a worldwide sweeping Revival there will be till those two witnesses fall with the Jews it's your prophet's message there's a place down here in Florida years ago it had been going about 10 or 15 years if it's still going that they were having Services 7 days a week seeing great signs and wonders take place but brother brandham said even though you have great signs and wonders come to pass he said and you continue with the same old Doctrine he said you're wrong wrong amen see that the other scripture they fail to read is where it said if a man give you a sign and it come to pass they get he leads you another to another God y so don't hear that man but you better read the rest of it I sent him among you to try you y somebody come in and say look the Dead's going to be raised there's going 10 people raised the dead and that show you how to believe me what do you say about the word right what's the word say how do you try people oh bless God I'll try you by the spirit now I just look you that's PC look in and brother calling W you blink your spirit's not right you blink he said I blink cuz I got something in my eye well where you at I'm not being silly I'm being truthful but what do you try anybody by right the word amen amen see if it fits this word amen don't fit this word you don't have to fear no years ago this sister told me while I said there a man over in India he believed he was God not just another something you know that brother Ram come to introduce him because he was God and the lady said I'm afraid to say anything about it well I said does he believe brother Brown's message you know well he said brother Brown was wrong in places she said well I ain't got no fear of him right that's right why because he's off the message why you going to be afraid of him Bo that you B back but listen church do you understand there must needs to be things happen Among Us I'll try not to review this so much readon I'm trying to put it on you but it's to help us right it anchors you down amen see then when somebody comes along with another one you say uhoh there's that same old Doctrine just another wording for it two Lords are just another wording for Two Souls that's right and all of you know the two Lord man but yet I'm sorry I just don't agree with it I just maybe I'm lost you stuck with me for another year okay let's Stand Together come on Brothers you stuck with me for another year so don't worry about it right I'll try to do the best I can you don't have the communion just yeah we don't have no singing we're just going to have to commun about to forget that see think on these things now we do one thing for sure that we always do we always give time to you know if anybody wants to be prayed for or anything we here to come but let's just saying only believe if anybody has a need you can come to the altar we pray with you pray for you then we'll take communion when we get through them right only all things are possible only be okay we're going into the scripture 1 Corinthians 11:23 for I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread and when he had given thanks he broke it and said take it eat this is take eat this is my body which is broken for you this do in remembrance of me after the same manner also so he took the cup when he had s saying this cup is the New Testament in my blood this doe ye as of as you drink it in remembrance of me for as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup you do sh the Lord's death till he come wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord but let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh Damnation to himself not Discerning the Lord's body for this cause many are weak and sickly among you and many sleep for if we would judge ourselves we should not be judged but when we are judged we are chasen to the Lord that we should not be condemned with the world wherefore my brethren when you come together to eat t one for another and if any man hunger let him eat at home that you come not together under condemnation the rest will I set in order when I come you know like we were saying and reading this morning about Paul and the believing of the word you know none of the disciples were chosen to record the fact of the communion right but Paul coming along out of due season and God opened the word to him from all of the topes and the shadows and the things and then he spoke in communion so it did unfold into deeper things when so he did open their understanding and even teaching things to come it's a wonderful thing in it so let's just have a few minutes of Silent prayer making ready to where we can all take the communion you know and just Fellowship together around it we thank you for all things Lord and we commit them unto you believing you thank you for Thy word the truth that we have and we believe you just be with each and every one of us make us worthy to take the communion Lord because none of us are worthy cuz there's no way to be worthy in ourselves but is what you have made us and not we ourselves we love you and we thank you in Jesus name the Bible said he took bread and blessed it father we thank you for this bread it's went through the time ready now for us to take we know it's only a symbol yet in that symbol of great things can take place if we really believe it because it is an ordinance given unto us and we believe it we ask you now to sanctify the bread and the partakers in Jesus name it was a broken body yes it was not a round wafer looking in the Kingdom's tap the other day and you can you can order communion stuff and and they'll send you a little cup and it's already pre filled it's everything's ready and it's got a little wafer lay on top of it and you just got it every bit there and you just hand out those little cups everybody just got their own doings but that's not correct right you know and naturally they don't have wine they have grape juice and the people would differ with us and say you mean y'all take wine yes we take wine right but it's not right to drink well don't take your if you think it's wrong to to drink a little supp of wine then when you get to coughing real bad like I've been at it don't drink no cough syrup because a lot of it's 18% alcohol and the wine we make here is probably very very low even below beer is only 12% I think something in that order so don't be so super religious you know father we thank you for this Lov and Grace offering that you've made for each and every one those that you did one day pour out your blood for us this is only a symbol of it where the wine Lord represented because it's a stimulation we'll eat the bread we'll drink the wine that becomes cells in our body to live off of Lord your spirit then would Quicken the word that we have heard and we ask you to just bless each and every one of us sanctify the wine and their partakers now in Jesus name amen come morning I walk by the river I'll the everen tree I'll carry my cross through the mid come morning there's glory for me sometimes I'm despised and and rejected and I question oh Father how then I take one more look at Mount Calvary I look around and I see the world and it falling apart and I see that the word said that's what would take place so then I can be encouraged in my spirit right and I can see that no I don't want this to happen but I can see that it will that it will come upon mankind just because we brought it right the prophet said God never destroyed the Water World with water he said science did right sence is one Destro that's right excuse me but you see we just try to make the best we can while we here then when it's all over and done with Y we no problems here right amen we have a wonderful time right I won't be coughing over there you just pray for me I certainly don't want what I did last year you remember I had a b hour with a problem last year with it but I ain't worried about that I'm just concerned with serving God am and try to be a servant to him and a servant to you you know to be able to help you and to do what we can do for the Lord be able to help out as much as we can you know out to the world for the people to see and hear and they got an opportunity to hear and that doesn't mean we're all right it just means simply one thing that we're trying CU I believe around the world that there's a bride of Christ a fful Ministry and working in the bride of Christ around the world and they're bringing God's word and I believe that I trust while they're finishing up with that I will announce this way sister Regina is going to make up a kind of a little board cuz she asked me could she do it and for those the people that are way off you know and we have like we did yesterday we have the Bible study or something or we have these special meetings where you're up here on Saturday where you don't have to go back home she's going to make out a list and if you want to volunteer to allow somebody to stay in your home which is around in here closer see then you put on there that you will receive people as much as you can all right then we'll go on the other side of it and write down somebody say well I need a place to stay right well that way it won't be the same one doing it all the time it'll be different once and we can all benefit from it it's really something sister Trudy stayed with us last night and we sat down we talk a little bit we got up this morning sitting over some coughing talking about the word of the lord well we just have a good time fellowshipping you know and we don't get to see each other too often anyway so and that's to you that are off where you're having to drive a long ways it ain't brother Al cuz he comes over to my house you know that's kind of close for me and him and that' be all right right if he was to come and be glad for come spend the night but that wouldn't be what I'm talking about somebody down the road good pace and if you want to open up your home to let somebody stay we when they see yes your thing made up you write your name on there that's right and then when the times comes we can take care of it right sure all right amen everybody do that let's all protect together you can be seated for a moment is everything ready you like turning your scripture to John 13 we'll read the scripture before we go into the foot worship and suffer being ended the devil had him now put into the heart of Judas isare Simon son to betray him Jesus knowing that the father had given all thanks into his hands and he was come from God and went through God he RIS from supper and laid aside his garments and took a towel and GED himself after that he poured water into a Bas and begin to wash the disciples feet and to wipe them with the towel wherewith he was GED then cometh he to Simon Peter and Peter Sith unto him Lord lest thou wash my feet Jesus answered and said unto him what I do thou knowest not now but Thou shalt know Hereafter Peter said unto him thou shal never wash my feet Jesus answered him if I wash thee not thou H has no part with me Simon Peter said unto him Lord not my feet only but also my hands and my head Jesus said unto him that he that is worse need us not save to wash his feet but is clean every with and you are clean but not all for a knew who should betray him therefore said he you are not all clean so after he had washed their feet and had taken his garments and was set down again he said unto them know ye what I have done to you you call me master and Lord and you say well for so I am if I then your Lord and Master have wash your feet you also are to wash one another's feet for I've given you an example that you should do as I have done to you verily verily I say unto you the servant is not greater than his Lord neither he that is sent greater than he that sent him if you know these things happy are ye if you do them let's stand together and be dismissed remember the service is Wednesday pray that the Lord would bless we be trying to cover some of these doctrinal things and all in throughout the the time and just if you have something you want to be brought out write it down and hand it in and we'll try our best to cover it I've got a couple of questions back there on my desk now that while we'll get to eventually and one of them is marriage and divorce this her person said I'm not clear about this would you speak on it well we'll go through marriage and divorce one day just see you know what it is about it what we can

had to finally just tell her I can't answer the rest of them you know I don't have time I've got to do something else you know and preach something else I did and they were great questions they were not just you know little simple ones they were great but just write them down and bring them and we'll talk on these things you know and see what the Lord has to say about it father we thank you we
