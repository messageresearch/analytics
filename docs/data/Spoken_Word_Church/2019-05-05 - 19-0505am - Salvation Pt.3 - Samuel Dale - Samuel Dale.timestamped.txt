[9:17] believe it and we thank you for it we
[9:19] love you in Wicca we just commit
[9:21] everything to you now in Jesus name Amen
[9:26] Ephesians 2 verse 5 even when we were
[9:35] dead in sins hath quickened us together
[9:38] with Christ by grace you're saved and
[9:42] have raised us up together and let us
[9:44] sit together in heavenly places in
[9:47] Christ Jesus that in the ages to come he
[9:50] might show the exceeding riches of His
[9:53] grace in his kindness toward us through
[9:57] Jesus Christ for by grace are you saved
[10:00] through faith now remember what we've
[10:02] been bringing out up here he says that
[10:06] by grace you're saved okay that's
[10:10] wonderful
[10:11] then he comes down and he adds more into
[10:15] his thought and he says for by grace are
[10:19] you saved through faith he's explaining
[10:22] how you're saved
[10:25] right now he's expressing or explaining
[10:29] what salvation is no for by grace are
[10:34] you saved through faith and that not of
[10:35] yourself is the gift of God not of works
[10:38] lest any man should boast you may be
[10:41] seated the Lord had his blessing to the
[10:43] reading of the word now trying to get
[10:47] and I have a hard way of approaching
[10:51] things and you know I'm sorry that's
[10:55] just me but I've tried to get your
[11:00] thoughts into a channel in the Word of
[11:04] God and get you to thinking on that line
[11:06] just like that point Darcy
[11:08] he says you're saved by
[11:11] by faith right but then he comes in
[11:16] adding the point or thought to that
[11:19] you're saved by grace through faith okay
[11:23] now he's explaining more what he's
[11:27] talking about okay are you following me
[11:30] see then there is something about you
[11:33] just say well I I'm saved by faith well
[11:36] that's that's good or you say I'm saved
[11:39] by grace that's good but what I like is
[11:43] Paul with the ability to put them both
[11:46] together and expressing what is taking
[11:51] place in your Christian journey that
[11:55] you're taking because that's what we've
[11:57] been trying to speak about right that by
[12:00] grace are you saved grace is God's
[12:03] unmerited favor okay are you saved
[12:06] through faith in other words you're
[12:10] taking a journey and if you're we're
[12:13] talking about salvation we'll get back
[12:15] to these and expressing it that you you
[12:19] can say the Prophet said one day he said
[12:22] your salvation life's as long as your
[12:24] confession well wait a minute now you
[12:27] you don't seem to believe well we'll get
[12:29] on to that one you know we we're trying
[12:32] to lay a foundation to get to a point
[12:36] see I believe that the Christian journey
[12:40] starts the day you accept Jesus Christ
[12:43] as your Savior all right now that starts
[12:46] your Christian journey okay now through
[12:50] faith okay because see that way then it
[12:57] will keep unfolding and won't stop and
[13:01] Peter you know he says being born again
[13:06] what not of corruptible seed but of
[13:12] incorruptible how by the Word of God
[13:16] which liveth and abideth forever all
[13:19] right so now your Christian journey
[13:22] you're being born again
[13:24] it's not just something that we come up
[13:27] well I've accepted Jesus Christ as my
[13:29] savior you know and 20 years later you
[13:33] said what's your coz I accepted Jesus
[13:35] Christ as my savior you mean there's
[13:37] been no growth development or anything
[13:39] in your journey then I questioned your
[13:43] journey I think water question in our
[13:47] own journey if what we have is not
[13:50] growing within us and has been growing
[13:54] all of our Christian journey we should
[13:56] question what's taking place you know we
[14:00] were discussing this last night you know
[14:03] and the Bible study had a good time
[14:05] about it and see I was trying to say
[14:07] something about that so I believe that
[14:09] that if you you get something starts in
[14:14] the Christian journey and God begins to
[14:17] unveil himself to you it'll never stop
[14:22] it'll keep on going so then as I've
[14:26] always taught you I've always taught
[14:29] this to the church and believe it what's
[14:32] my statement I'd rather go through life
[14:37] seeking God and get out at the end of
[14:41] the journey and find out I had him all
[14:44] the time then to go through life not
[14:48] seeking God and get out the end of the
[14:51] her and find out I didn't have him all
[14:54] right
[14:55] see then what's wrong you say yeah but
[14:57] it you see that's what but if I did I
[15:00] you know no no no it's not trying to get
[15:03] nobody to deny nothing you ever talk to
[15:06] a good old Trinity and he said father
[15:08] neither father deny deny the son no
[15:11] we're not denying nothing we're just
[15:12] talking about the truth I believe your
[15:15] salvation begins but it never ends and
[15:20] what is my finality in the statement of
[15:24] finishing in it all right
[15:25] your new birth starts with your
[15:28] believing and your new birth will end
[15:32] when you're in a total glorified
[15:34] condition body spirit and soul
[15:37] you can truly say then I'm born again
[15:41] but you're not saying that you're not
[15:43] born again before then no but you're in
[15:47] a journey and that's why I've tried to
[15:50] to say it see that it's a journey of
[15:55] Revelation it's a journey of God
[15:58] revealing himself to you you said but
[16:04] but but I you know I can't connect my
[16:08] salvation because that's what we're
[16:10] opposed to be talking on right I can't
[16:12] connect my salvation to any revelation
[16:16] the way you seem to talk about you know
[16:20] that that we need a revelation well I'm
[16:23] not the one who doing the talking the
[16:24] prophets one that said you know what is
[16:26] the new birth brother on Christ the
[16:28] mystery he said it's a revelation of
[16:30] Jesus Christ personally to you well now
[16:35] then it's not to every one of us you
[16:40] know as one we're Gentiles we're coming
[16:43] in you know the we ever want I was
[16:46] reading this morning where the Prophet
[16:47] says everbody must have their own
[16:51] experience all right then I believe now
[16:58] listen I believe because what I've
[17:00] always tried to teach I believe it's
[17:02] what the Bible teaches that everybody's
[17:07] new birth is the same every babies born
[17:11] the same you said no this doing well
[17:14] we're talking with normal babies we're
[17:15] talking about the Syrians we talking
[17:18] about this that or the other we're
[17:19] talking about it in the line of normal
[17:21] birth of a child it's water blood and
[17:25] life all right we'll get to that and am
[17:28] I asking you if you would have asked you
[17:31] to read it over and over and then you go
[17:34] back to the future home and read it
[17:36] start and read about the first 20 pages
[17:39] especially because we're gonna try to
[17:41] the Lord when's the Lord's coming
[17:44] Wednesday we'll try to move in to our
[17:47] thought more you know to Express
[17:50] we're talking about alright but see what
[17:55] is faith you said well I've never had a
[17:59] revelant what did the man say what
[18:01] brother Brown said the man said we can
[18:03] excel revela he said then you can't
[18:05] accept Jesus Christ you don't believe in
[18:09] revelation youi you can't be saved
[18:12] because the Bible says upon this rock
[18:16] this revelation he said he would build
[18:20] the church well it's built on the
[18:25] revelation of Jesus Christ that's what
[18:28] we're talking about this by Sunday see
[18:30] there's no promise in the Bible of the
[18:33] Holy Ghost to come upon you under Father
[18:36] Son and Holy Ghost but under the Lord
[18:40] Jesus Christ at least you've got a
[18:41] promise right
[18:44] see you come to a promise you're putting
[18:46] it to the basis that depend upon what
[18:49] God says about it alright so if I can
[18:53] get to a promise I like that okay but
[18:58] see now get this point we'll try to move
[19:01] into the thought we must accept Jesus
[19:08] Christ as our Savior all right but then
[19:13] he must accept us and that's kind of you
[19:18] know to people that have not paid
[19:21] attention to those thoughts you know
[19:25] it's just a lot of people think
[19:28] salvation is just I accepted Jesus
[19:30] Christ and that's it well now how are
[19:33] you going to put it together with all of
[19:35] the scripture if that is just your
[19:37] thought well what happened brother Dale
[19:40] well you ought to remember what happened
[19:45] well I've never had an experience well
[19:50] yeah I mean II won't we read the brother
[19:55] on said ever born-again believer must
[19:58] have the experience of the new birth
[20:03] well I'll probably bread rather see this
[20:06] we're not talking about evidences we're
[20:11] not talking about that
[20:12] I believe God was real before ever heard
[20:16] of this message right but I don't count
[20:20] none of that as being my experience many
[20:24] things happen but I count none of that
[20:25] is my experience I have an experience
[20:28] that is word related so they don't have
[20:32] to worry about it yeah those disciples
[20:36] we'll get to this later in talking about
[20:38] it those disciples spent three and a
[20:41] half years going through justification
[20:44] and sanctification you wouldn't just a
[20:50] haphazard journey it wasn't just one
[20:52] thing they all run up to Pentecost got
[20:54] the Holy Ghost how come there's only 120
[20:57] got it there were the only ones that had
[21:02] come through justification and
[21:04] sanctification is that sensible you'll
[21:07] see that as we relate it together to
[21:09] Jesus and doing like a ask them life's
[21:12] not about it
[21:16] you've got to have the three stages of
[21:20] grace right but how come Jesus said you
[21:29] got to be born of water and spirit
[21:30] that's only two
[21:39] I'd like to make you think I'd like to
[21:46] make you consider something because
[21:51] Jesus says you're born to water I'm a
[21:54] spirit okay but we believe in
[22:03] justification sanctification the baptism
[22:06] of the Holy Ghost well I've always just
[22:10] been told about like I do believe the
[22:12] Prophet I wouldn't the one that taught
[22:17] these things so I would suggest you
[22:20] listen to the Prophet is more what I'm
[22:23] saying you know to listen to him express
[22:27] what the new bird really is now remember
[22:33] he was born the Prophet that right that
[22:39] didn't make him saved they must be more
[22:48] to the journey than just to believe I
[22:56] wasn't him that said he said I'd have
[22:59] been saved when I was 12 years old if it
[23:01] hadn't been for that demon hanging there
[23:03] now do we listen to him all that what
[23:08] he's saying do you say yeah but he was
[23:16] right he was he's born a prophet but
[23:20] there was a lot of those people that
[23:22] were born prophets especially not Old
[23:24] Testament group of people because all of
[23:26] those prophets were born prophets but
[23:28] none of them had the baptism when the
[23:30] Holy Ghost because they never made it to
[23:37] penticoff even the great John the
[23:39] Baptist never made it to the Upper Room
[23:43] experience the Upper Room experiences
[23:48] the new birth
[23:54] now don't you think they had a great
[23:56] understanding of the Word of God
[23:58] don't you think that even you get in I
[24:01] believe this in Luke and then especially
[24:02] when you get into revelaed me know the
[24:06] book of Acts then he opened their
[24:10] understanding of the scriptures well
[24:15] that's all I need to get saved just get
[24:17] my understanding of the scriptures open
[24:20] well now according to the Bible go read
[24:24] it he opened their understanding of the
[24:28] scriptures he does it then he comes on
[24:32] back over to the group and opens their
[24:34] understanding of the scriptures and
[24:36] they're still not saved they prove
[24:40] they're not safe because they say an ax
[24:43] 1 are you going to restore the kingdom
[24:45] now to Israel they didn't know what he
[24:50] was talking about he says you don't
[24:51] understand what we were saying about
[24:53] Nicodemus Nicodemus couldn't understand
[24:59] when Jesus was saying you must be born
[25:01] again but do you understand what it
[25:06] means come on do you understand what the
[25:16] new birth is well I just all I've ever
[25:20] done just believe the word well that's a
[25:25] good point but now that's quoting their
[25:31] moment ago but jesus said upon this rock
[25:34] I'll build my church upon this
[25:38] revelation so we're saved by grace
[25:43] through faith which is a revelation you
[25:48] can't be saved according to that my
[25:50] vision I got these laying here I read
[25:52] them over and over to you and they're on
[25:54] the internet so anybody out dark and
[25:56] pull them up and read them you can't be
[26:00] saved without it being a revelation
[26:03] I don't understand that Brazil cuz I've
[26:06] never got no revelation number one you
[26:12] might not know what you're talking about
[26:14] and trying to understand what you need
[26:16] and what I mean by der the Prophet means
[26:18] by it
[26:20] number two you might not have it well
[26:26] I'll tell you whom I don't like you talk
[26:28] to me like that you know my whole life
[26:31] is built on believing brother Branham
[26:34] was a prophet well I'm reading or
[26:40] quoting to you what your prophet said
[26:48] I'm quoting the Bible that says you're
[26:51] saved by grace through faith well that's
[27:02] just true believin that's a good start
[27:06] in the right direction but it ain't a
[27:08] finish to the story when it says you're
[27:11] saved by grace through faith that's not
[27:13] just believing to say well I believe it
[27:16] well what else you think I'm supposed to
[27:18] do believe God until God believes you
[27:22] right that's the best way to say it did
[27:27] your prophet teach each other way you
[27:29] salv accepted Jesus Christ as my savior
[27:31] he said but as he accepted you well I
[27:36] didn't know I had to that's what we were
[27:38] discussing a little eyes not see God
[27:40] waited ignorant until the truth is
[27:43] presented but once the truth is
[27:46] presented we have no right to be
[27:48] ignorant anymore faith is a revelation
[27:57] and you can't be saved without a
[27:59] revelation
[28:00] I tried my best to explain something
[28:06] I'll get back to it more than it I've
[28:08] never attempted to explain a lot about
[28:10] my experience but I tried to a little
[28:12] bit last night
[28:16] you see if you don't have a revelation
[28:22] you don't have the new birth you show up
[28:37] or picture does well I'll tell you what
[28:43] to I'd rather go and face you at
[28:45] judgment on the basis of me trying to
[28:47] tell you the truth than have to face you
[28:50] Darwin I wouldn't tell you the truth I
[28:55] guess the tickle of these preachers they
[28:58] say boy it's hard being a preacher it
[29:01] ain't hard to preach like most people
[29:03] preach you just believe the message
[29:05] you're on your way to heaven everything
[29:06] took care of glory hallelujah make sure
[29:09] you pay it out right it's hard to preach
[29:23] the truth it's easy to preach a life
[29:26] there's no problem with preaching a life
[29:29] me it's hard to preach the truth to get
[29:35] the truth settle down into our hearts
[29:37] and lives to where we won't argue back
[29:41] with it well brother Taylor I didn't
[29:44] know we had to have how long have you
[29:48] been in this church because this is what
[29:50] I've talked for nearly fifty years I've
[29:53] taught it this way and I believe it
[29:55] you've got to have a definite experience
[29:58] of justification the disciples did
[30:02] you've got to have a definite experience
[30:06] of sanctification the disciples did and
[30:09] by only of those two things being in
[30:12] manifestation in their lives
[30:15] khadiyah could they qualify for going to
[30:18] the upper room to receive the experience
[30:25] well you sound like you mean it I need
[30:27] to be justified sink if I'd feel with
[30:30] all
[30:30] I thought that that was what it was some
[30:39] of you come from Pentecost that's bad
[30:41] listen time we didn't teach you about
[30:43] justification sanctification the baptism
[30:45] of the Holy Ghost right we didn't even
[30:48] know the words we just believed we got
[30:52] it all one will bleed I accepted Jesus
[30:58] Christ as my savior and you can't tell
[31:00] me I'm saved
[31:02] I'm not trying to tell you I'm sorry I'm
[31:06] trying to tell you
[31:07] you lost souls brown you see maybe
[31:18] that's one of it okay go on being born
[31:22] again it means a process is taking place
[31:28] right you're in a journey and in that
[31:38] journey you're traveling the journey is
[31:44] a journey by faith or you're saved by
[31:49] grace but it's through faith now I'm
[31:57] gonna say it this way but I hope you'll
[31:59] keep it in line and thought it's really
[32:00] not to just say by faith but that's true
[32:03] that's alright we'll go along with it
[32:05] but just remember it's not just by faith
[32:07] well I'm saved by faith don't say by
[32:12] grace through faith if my journey of a
[32:16] Christian stops I prove I never was
[32:19] right to start with
[32:21] that's all I've tried my best to say to
[32:23] you all I've ever tried to say to you if
[32:29] you started out believing and you quit
[32:32] believing what happened the because it's
[32:38] not supposed to be that way
[32:43] a child is born into the world and it
[32:48] starts a journey of living if it stops
[32:54] it dies well is any problem with your
[32:59] prophet then saying he said people use
[33:03] the word salvation so loosely in other
[33:07] words until he said you say well I'm
[33:11] saved I tell you what I'm saved
[33:19] I believe I'm saying and the evidence
[33:21] I'm saved is I believe the message well
[33:26] let me ask you this question in a simple
[33:29] matter but yet what did you believe
[33:33] before you heard the message
[33:35] I had great experiences and things
[33:43] happening and the great understanding
[33:45] before I heard of the message I've tried
[33:49] to teach you those things and get you to
[33:51] understand there was a lot of people had
[33:54] a lot of understanding of the Word of
[33:57] God before the Prophet ever came on the
[33:59] scene he didn't start a lot of the
[34:02] doctrines that everybody thinks the
[34:06] Azusa Street were Pentecostals we yet
[34:10] they believed in the baptism of the Holy
[34:11] Ghost and they all they didn't everyone
[34:15] come up that's why you've got you won
[34:17] this is your tune assisting you this
[34:19] that or the other because of the way
[34:22] some of them believed in some stopped
[34:24] and they're believing well what if you
[34:26] stopping you're believing I'm just
[34:33] trying to be sensible because you to
[34:36] think about it do you know you're born
[34:41] again well I know I've done everything I
[34:45] can do uncle let's remember life Sunday
[34:47] when Cain What did he say that around
[34:53] him said
[34:54] name said I've done all I'm gonna do you
[34:58] take it or leave it
[35:00] well we know what happened that was
[35:04] where he made his worst mistake right
[35:06] because God didn't take it well I
[35:12] believe God I believe God and I've tried
[35:16] to live a good life amen
[35:20] thank God you showed me where a good
[35:25] life is reestablishing I thought it was
[35:28] an outward work I thought works and good
[35:34] things and doing right was an outward
[35:36] work of an inward work that had taken
[35:39] place well I didn't know I needed to be
[35:46] saved I thought I was saved
[35:50] yeah what do you know you're saved
[35:58] come on do you really know you whether
[36:03] you're saved or not and what on what
[36:06] basis do you put it I put don't believe
[36:09] in the Prophet now wait a minute
[36:11] let's get what the Prophet said the
[36:13] evidence of the holy ghost was what he
[36:16] said whether or not the spirit now he
[36:18] used it in their different ways and
[36:20] brought it okay but what did he say that
[36:22] ain't that the Lord straightened him out
[36:25] in a vision about it and what did he say
[36:28] so that's the last one and if anyone
[36:30] whether or not the spirit in you agrees
[36:32] with the word he didn't say whether or
[36:36] not the spirit and you agreed with the
[36:38] word agrees which means never stops
[36:42] being born again means you started a
[36:45] journey and you never stopped growing in
[36:50] grace and knowledge means that you're in
[36:52] just in that journey as you're traveling
[36:56] I'm trying to get you to just think well
[37:04] I don't like it what you doing go here
[37:06] you just you just put it to
[37:08] how do you still handle hope I would to
[37:12] God I could preach it that hard I would
[37:17] to God I could preach it so hard that
[37:19] everybody in this building and me myself
[37:22] would fall on our knees and cry out
[37:23] under God and try to get an answer from
[37:26] him this is not to play pretties and go
[37:32] to oh where but with brother brother
[37:34] sword so he's so sweet
[37:36] we'll go with him he's got no problems I
[37:43] didn't invite you here and I didn't say
[37:45] that wrong now people are welcome to
[37:48] come here but I didn't go out and get
[37:49] nobody and they some been here that's
[37:53] been women for 40 years around me at
[37:55] least they know I ain't never tried to
[37:57] do nothing but one thing I screamed and
[38:01] hollered about salvation all of these
[38:02] years but what do you teach your
[38:09] children well brother Dale don't
[38:12] understand he's he's a little hard yeah
[38:16] he's he's a little Stern about it well
[38:23] that may be true but is it the truth
[38:27] what I say do you teach your children
[38:34] you need to be warned again or is it
[38:39] like that I've always said to you about
[38:40] the the she bars it ate up the children
[38:43] with Elijah you know why they ate up the
[38:47] children because the children sat down
[38:49] and listened and mom and daddy was
[38:51] sitting at the table and they were
[38:53] saying why don't old ball head going up
[38:55] get the heaven and get away leave us
[38:57] alone them children just went out and
[38:59] said what mama and daddy didn't got ate
[39:00] up oh I don't like that good
[39:05] see you later I'm serious this is not
[39:12] trying to build anything a kingdom
[39:14] really it's trying to see whether or not
[39:16] we're born again
[39:20] my brother Dale I like it when you're on
[39:22] the see older than the plague hey I
[39:24] thought this was the seals enough time
[39:27] I thought salvation was the only thing
[39:29] we had that's the only doctor and I know
[39:36] the seals if it's the part of your
[39:39] journey it was part of runarounds
[39:42] journey he started then he went into
[39:44] this and went into that you need to skip
[39:47] under message this kept unfolding to him
[39:50] I thought that was what was supposed to
[39:53] happen to me in you what I was saying
[39:59] about you know you're gonna face brother
[40:03] branham about it not me yeah I mentioned
[40:07] seventy weeks of Daniel people I
[40:13] wouldn't know one that said in that book
[40:15] he said if you don't understand this
[40:17] Daniel seventy weeks you will not
[40:19] understand the seals it's in the book
[40:23] read it well I don't have to understand
[40:27] that I didn't say you did
[40:34] but what if you do I thought that the
[40:40] prophets said the bride was to be
[40:42] delivered of a new birth from according
[40:45] to Malachi 4 so it seems to be delivered
[40:53] of a new birth according to Malachi 4
[40:55] then that's not no childish doctrine
[41:00] there would be the entire message of
[41:03] Malachi 4 that we are to believe that
[41:06] God can bring it forth what about it
[41:14] will you sound like that I need to do
[41:17] something and all I've been taught out
[41:19] of my life they just believe well let me
[41:25] ask you one question
[41:26] what have you been taught to believe
[41:29] oh we've been taught to believe bread
[41:35] Randall was a prophet amen
[41:37] why is everybody falling away down why
[41:41] are they leaving it why are the ones
[41:44] that brought you into the message of
[41:45] maybe or leaving it evidently something
[41:50] went wrong see faith is a revelation you
[41:57] need me to read these to you faith your
[42:02] prophet said is a revelation it's a
[42:05] revelation of Jesus Christ personally to
[42:08] you but a writer like I said the
[42:17] disciples went three and a half years
[42:20] with the Lord Jesus teaching them the
[42:23] message right and then they went to the
[42:27] upper room what if they had not a had to
[42:33] three and a half years prior why would
[42:35] they not 4,000 in the upper room
[42:36] why was it not gonna at least what does
[42:39] the Scriptures tell us about he was seen
[42:41] of over 500 brethren or something like
[42:43] that after his resurrection why didn't
[42:45] they make it to the upper room right
[42:49] come on I'm quoting scripture he was
[42:52] seen of more than 500 brethren it and he
[42:55] called them brethren which means
[42:57] believers but evidently didn't believe
[43:02] or not to make it to the upper room
[43:14] you cannot be saved without a revelation
[43:18] because the new birth is a revelation
[43:22] the birth of the word the prophet says
[43:25] spoken word regional seed is the new
[43:29] birth the birth of the word there's your
[43:35] new birth well I just talked to just any
[43:40] understanding right then words you get
[43:43] to thoughts from well I I don't I just
[43:54] don't know what you're talking about
[43:55] I'll just go somewhere that's where I
[43:57] can understand the Lord be with you and
[44:02] me too
[44:04] but that's his honest as I can be I
[44:09] believe the new birth is the birth of
[44:12] the word
[44:13] what do you believe well it's just I
[44:17] just I just believe God well I thought
[44:19] God was the word so don't play games
[44:24] with me you're just trapping your own
[44:25] selves you're running around and around
[44:27] if the new birth is a burst of the word
[44:30] and God is the word what does heat
[44:33] waters brother Dale talking about what
[44:35] is your prophet talking about he said if
[44:43] your salvation
[44:44] you're believing stops he said then you
[44:48] lost your salvation I can't believe that
[44:53] cuz I believe it I believe once saved
[44:55] always saved well that's good bad news
[45:02] have you taught your children salvation
[45:17] do they know what it is to be saved
[45:25] well maybe mom and daddy don't know no
[45:29] more than to just say I believe well
[45:33] what do you believe I'm kind of like it
[45:37] fellow would any there's a BAP tighter
[45:39] than a minute you kept saying do you
[45:41] believe and put him down run him up you
[45:43] believe put him down brought him up you
[45:44] believe you got nothing holding me I
[45:47] believe you trying to drown me see you
[45:53] can get a believer out of something in a
[45:55] hurry right but what do you believe but
[46:09] I don't I don't need to know these
[46:11] things I'm just - I'm just simple
[46:13] brother Dale there's a lot of
[46:18] differences being a simple and stupid
[46:21] but they do go in the same category but
[46:25] just think about it now what I've been
[46:28] driving at and then we'll pick up later
[46:31] to try to get any more interesting
[46:32] points of talking about justification
[46:34] sanctification the baptismal oligos and
[46:42] to try to find out if we've ever
[46:44] experienced those fun have you ever had
[46:48] an experience of justification would you
[46:51] know what it is if you've never had it
[46:54] if it ain't talked to you how do you
[46:57] know what it is if it ain't been talk to
[47:00] you how do you know what it is
[47:12] if you ever went to a preacher and said
[47:15] what in the world you talking about went
[47:21] one sister here for years and asked her
[47:24] one day I didn't she went to another
[47:25] Church you know and I didn't bother me
[47:27] none
[47:28] I was friends with her nice try said
[47:30] what his brother so-and-so preached on
[47:32] the souls he said I don't know he never
[47:35] heard him saying I mean you go to a
[47:39] message church for years and know
[47:41] nothing about a soul you know nothing
[47:45] about salvation you know nothing about
[47:48] being born again what's wrong
[47:56] but yes you know everything else right
[48:04] you know everything else well what if
[48:07] your children ask you sir what is
[48:09] salvation could you express it to them
[48:18] could you explain salvation to eight ten
[48:23] twelve fourteen year old child will just
[48:32] believe the Lord that's all dear just
[48:36] believe the Lord I see you boom brother
[48:39] Dale was talking about something else
[48:41] because he seems to be talking about
[48:43] more than just believing what's he
[48:47] talking about
[48:54] you see that's why I'm not accepted at
[48:55] that basis I don't preach like the other
[48:58] preachers all the others wonder I mean
[48:59] saying although man is saying most of
[49:01] them they preach what don't do this do
[49:05] that don't do this don't do that just
[49:06] you do they believe this except that you
[49:09] know that wouldn't want to ask in the
[49:15] Bible's are they said what must we do to
[49:18] be saved
[49:21] what just believe run around with a
[49:23] prophet believe the word I know I
[49:33] shouldn't say a lot of things but I'm I
[49:35] mean here as a human being too
[49:39] we send our children to places and they
[49:42] hear doctrines talk do we correct the
[49:45] doctrines when they come back home
[49:55] that's all I'm asking you you hear dr.
[49:59] install some of you come told me that
[50:02] they did teach them things you know
[50:04] maybe the kids talking okay
[50:06] let your kids talk back tell them the
[50:09] truth and tell them to tell them the
[50:13] truth let them solve it it might be like
[50:18] one sister said one time she's been
[50:20] there was a meeting and all in in that
[50:23] they said something in this said she'd
[50:25] been after talking a good bit and this
[50:28] feller he said I know where you go to
[50:30] church he said you do he said yeah you
[50:35] go to brother Dale's in Lula Georgia
[50:37] says because I can hear him talking
[50:39] through what you're saying
[50:43] well isn't that a wonderful situation
[50:49] that we could have the answer to a lot
[50:52] of questions that people out that our
[50:55] children and it's not based upon what
[51:00] they said just believe it I've never had
[51:09] a revelation you'll say brother there
[51:10] well what's wrong we you mean God has
[51:14] never spoke to use never reveal nothing
[51:16] to eat come on they don't have to be a
[51:24] great time sisters come on all it can be
[51:27] is this you don't need to getting
[51:28] supposed to cut you higher that's a
[51:30] revelation now whether you believe it or
[51:35] not that's how simple I teach because
[51:42] why do you have to tell the women
[51:43] there's wrong to cut to her wear their
[51:46] pants and do this I know when your
[51:47] prophet says you didn't have to once
[51:49] they got born again well why don't we
[51:51] get them born again
[51:54] well not brother Dale they from around
[51:56] here yeah and I'm not a dummy I can look
[52:00] at higher cuts her don't grow straight
[52:02] across in the back okay
[52:08] if I was you I'd wise up a little bit
[52:11] okay now come on if I was you I'd wise
[52:15] up a little bit if my daughter wanted to
[52:18] have her hair cut she'd have it could in
[52:19] a V she wouldn't have it cut straight
[52:22] across because when you cutting the
[52:23] straight across and automatically admits
[52:25] you cut it at least you can lie a little
[52:27] bit and let them cut it at an angle
[52:31] brother Dale you're stupid I agree with
[52:34] you but it's better than to be so silly
[52:39] right
[52:43] what about it
[52:44] what is your revelation if you ever had
[52:52] a revelation of Eva come ooon is that
[53:01] what the Prophet said
[53:02] did he tell the story about the man that
[53:05] whenever were trying to find Christ he
[53:08] had to plant you know he read about it
[53:10] where were you spend eternity or
[53:11] something anyone ever were trying he
[53:13] went to old robbers doing all of them
[53:15] you come back to brother Brandon what we
[53:17] run say you had it all time said cuz
[53:25] when you picked up that track you made a
[53:26] decision
[53:35] well do you believe here profit he said
[53:41] that was the salvation what if your
[53:43] salvation is based upon what you believe
[53:45] I believe it is I'm not questioning to
[53:50] myself for the profit or the Bible I'm
[53:52] questioning you what is your revelation
[53:58] could you explain one God to somebody
[54:05] without saying the profit sale Yeah
[54:07] right
[54:11] come on you don't throw me wrong I throw
[54:15] back at you don't start stuff on me like
[54:17] what you don't believe the brother I
[54:18] believe more than you think about
[54:20] brother branham but you see I set and
[54:25] look and read setting yesterday and
[54:28] setting this morning reading for the
[54:30] Prophet said it's not what you do it's
[54:33] not what these things are he said it's
[54:35] not how good you are and that's why I'm
[54:42] calling that phrase right there you
[54:43] don't want us to live good no won't you
[54:45] get born again i thrown in there you
[54:50] hear that and you say well brother l
[54:51] don't believe in living good now you
[54:52] lied I didn't say that I believe in
[55:00] getting born again then I believe in
[55:07] being born again that that journey just
[55:11] starts when you start you're believing
[55:15] but what's wrong with the most of people
[55:17] is what your prophet said when you stop
[55:19] believing you lose your you lose your
[55:21] confession you lose your salvation
[55:36] but you see can they take a Trinity in
[55:40] deprogram you well you know what the new
[55:50] birth then if that can't be done the new
[55:53] birth has something to do with the
[55:55] revelation of God's Word to you there's
[56:02] reading the one overlaying here where
[56:03] veteran says the only way you can be a
[56:05] son or daughter of God is by revelation
[56:09] given unto you which is a birth we claim
[56:17] to be his children but know nothing
[56:18] about what he taught us
[56:28] then go ahead but see it'll all be gonna
[56:34] be a Whooper quick cuz we know we can't
[56:36] keep on the way we're going
[56:37] I may never made no dates they ain't
[56:39] never set none never worried about it
[56:44] but there's one thing for sure it's
[56:46] gonna be over with and we're gonna face
[56:50] our maker and I ain't gonna face him
[56:53] with the blood of any of you on to me
[56:55] that won't tell you the truth about it
[57:00] don't try to convince me you're born
[57:03] again cuz that wouldn't help you got me
[57:09] convinced I wouldn't have nothin
[57:21] a revelation that around said it's got
[57:25] to be revealed to you he said the only
[57:30] way you could be saved is by revelation
[57:33] what do you mean we come up to the altar
[57:37] brother Dale and we cried and we prayed
[57:42] now listen to her this is how simple
[57:45] we're gonna try to have to make it your
[57:50] salvation didn't start up here at the
[57:52] altar now come on don't misquote me on
[57:57] the quotes and then I can quote - but
[57:59] don't do that take what I'm saying you
[58:02] leave the all the seat and you come to
[58:04] the front and you get prayed for your
[58:06] salvation didn't begin here it begun
[58:09] back there because there's where you
[58:11] made your decision right your decision
[58:17] was made when you stood up brother
[58:18] Brendan said raising your hand
[58:20] he said it's impossible to raise them
[58:22] without some spirit moving it see your
[58:30] salvation begin maybe in the middle of
[58:32] the night last night as you were
[58:33] thinking about where am I saved or not -
[58:40] word begin come on close the prophet how
[58:46] did they explain it when you get up and
[58:48] start towards the front he said right
[58:50] darts where it was that cause you made
[58:52] your decision
[58:58] the other is manifestation and things
[59:00] happening through your journey
[59:13] do you really have the new birth
[59:22] well brother Dale I have to agree that
[59:25] it don't go along with everything you
[59:27] say well now of what did I say if I said
[59:31] what the Prophet said and the Bible says
[59:34] we ain't got no argument because your
[59:38] own wrong ground trying to talk to me
[59:40] that way if I got it in the word and got
[59:45] it the prophets message don't try to get
[59:48] me to change it but don't you think no
[59:51] no don't have no thoughts but could it
[59:55] be brother Dale that that we've all this
[59:58] time we've tried to and brother Branham
[59:59] would and really a prophet is that what
[1:00:03] you're saying there what it what is your
[1:00:04] point is your salvation based purely
[1:00:12] upon brother Branham was a prophet or is
[1:00:16] it fate was it based on the Lord Jesus
[1:00:19] Christ and salvation which one
[1:00:30] you try to put everything and I'm
[1:00:31] putting his honest I can be you try to
[1:00:34] put everything up on what you believe
[1:00:36] but what do you believe you believe
[1:00:43] today and tomorrow you don't believe as
[1:00:49] I said we'll finish this journey
[1:00:50] probably 20 year or 20 messages from now
[1:00:54] but my whole point is one thing you
[1:00:57] realize we're showing what we are we're
[1:01:00] producing what we are we're showing the
[1:01:03] world what we are maybe that's why your
[1:01:06] children don't want the message no no no
[1:01:15] you shouldn't talk like that now why
[1:01:26] well you don't never do nothing wrong
[1:01:28] yeah I do a lot wrong what do you got it
[1:01:30] what are you trying to make it on well
[1:01:38] maybe the children don't want the
[1:01:40] message we claim because we don't
[1:01:42] present it correctly we making it a book
[1:01:45] of rules or an idea or a thought like
[1:01:48] that instead of making it a revelation
[1:01:51] of Jesus Christ
[1:01:52] because that's what I told them last
[1:01:54] night and I mean it I don't care what
[1:01:58] they prove brother branham was wrong
[1:02:00] here brother branham was this brother
[1:02:02] Brown was married ten times brother
[1:02:03] branham was all this at the other I
[1:02:05] don't care because the message he
[1:02:13] brought has brought me to Christ
[1:02:19] what about you are you willing to put it
[1:02:22] that away
[1:02:24] well no brother they live quite that
[1:02:27] strong and because a brother so-and-so
[1:02:29] said brother branham was wrong here and
[1:02:31] I can't disprove it well so what they
[1:02:36] said Jesus was wrong but Jesus brought
[1:02:42] God to a human element to worry could
[1:02:45] make a sacrifice for you and I to where
[1:02:47] we could live a Christian life I thought
[1:02:49] that's what the Prophet was trying to do
[1:02:51] not to try to make us a bunch of good
[1:02:53] people or this that or the other but to
[1:02:55] make us born-again Christians that loved
[1:02:59] the Lord Jesus in our heart and don't
[1:03:01] matter what anybody else said about it
[1:03:04] you sound like you don't know what run
[1:03:06] around true enough
[1:03:07] that's up to you I don't have no problem
[1:03:09] my answer is my answer
[1:03:11] I don't care what they can say I
[1:03:17] appreciate that Baptist preacher that
[1:03:21] led me to Jesus Christ and I was in a
[1:03:23] Baptist Church what about you I went
[1:03:33] back and thank them folders for helping
[1:03:35] me you ever done that I'm talking about
[1:03:40] some of them preachers I said under I
[1:03:42] thanked him for helping me someone's
[1:03:47] been in this message just turned me out
[1:03:49] and kicked me away and everything else
[1:03:51] I've went to him and said thank you for
[1:03:53] helping me if you got enough salvation
[1:03:58] to do that ain't gonna thank that
[1:04:01] brother he run me out of the church
[1:04:03] thank God for running me out of the
[1:04:05] church
[1:04:15] I don't understand you see that's what I
[1:04:16] mean you don't understand me because you
[1:04:18] don't understand salvation
[1:04:20] you got salvation based on some kind of
[1:04:23] goody-goodies and it's that of the other
[1:04:24] instead of putting it on the truth of
[1:04:26] the word I have no problems with the
[1:04:32] Pope of Rome but I said I'll call him my
[1:04:40] brother he said this ain't gonna kiss
[1:04:42] his toe he's not calling brother blessed
[1:04:49] gone ain't calling a potent oh brother
[1:04:51] you're not saved oh no salvation puts
[1:04:57] Christ in you that overlooks whatever
[1:05:00] thing else he is how can your testimony
[1:05:06] win the Pope has to try to be a
[1:05:09] Christian if you don't give him some
[1:05:10] opportunity I thought we were such
[1:05:20] overshoe of Christianity that's that's
[1:05:23] what I said this is 20 sermons down the
[1:05:24] road I thought our life was to show
[1:05:26] Christianity of the world maybe that's
[1:05:32] why some of you your wives your
[1:05:34] husband's and your families don't want
[1:05:36] the message you shouldn't talk like that
[1:05:39] brother to hell well I don't have to
[1:05:44] worry about it it's not enough been that
[1:05:47] good about it and if not my wife's been
[1:05:48] that good about it but all of our
[1:05:50] children sitting here today where's
[1:05:53] yours now you're hurting feelings praise
[1:05:58] God I hurt your feelings
[1:06:00] you'll do something about it if I don't
[1:06:03] hurt your feelings you'll go on this
[1:06:05] earth
[1:06:05] well I'm goody-goody I miss that in the
[1:06:07] other I've done the best I can do you
[1:06:10] ain't doing the best you can do and I
[1:06:11] didn't do the best I could do right but
[1:06:19] I tried my best teach the children this
[1:06:21] meant yeah you said it home and teach
[1:06:26] the children about the messy
[1:06:28] we're not supposed to get that away
[1:06:30] brother yeah you said at home and try to
[1:06:33] tell them how good the message is you're
[1:06:36] a lying hypocrite now that's more than
[1:06:39] being lost
[1:06:41] Rodell you just called me a hypocrite a
[1:06:43] liar
[1:06:44] hey man is it true
[1:06:53] like I said about Elijah them kids heard
[1:06:59] that from somebody and then when our
[1:07:05] turns got killed they already took the
[1:07:08] momma's and daddies out and fed them to
[1:07:10] the bar come on it's time to either
[1:07:17] start living the Christian life and
[1:07:19] being with Christ I just quit right just
[1:07:26] quit you don't run people off I didn't
[1:07:32] run you in
[1:07:33] I ain't trying to run nobody off you
[1:07:37] just don't understand me I'm trying to
[1:07:39] save you let's look back here and I see
[1:07:47] some things and happening around here
[1:07:49] and a certain little old sister sitting
[1:07:51] here today and she quit coming to church
[1:07:54] and her two kids told her said mama that
[1:07:58] and I'm preaching what them are Lula we
[1:08:01] need to get back to Lula well you know
[1:08:03] what they back in Lula now thank you
[1:08:04] boys keep telling mama what to do yep
[1:08:15] that ain't hurt her because they told
[1:08:19] her the truth
[1:08:26] bless God you ain't gonna tell me that I
[1:08:28] do wrong kids why not if you're wrong
[1:08:34] come on what are you talking about I'm
[1:08:41] talking about one thing
[1:08:45] salvation is a journey it starts but
[1:08:53] it'll never end until we walk out of
[1:08:56] this world and when we walk out of this
[1:08:58] world it will be just the beginning
[1:09:04] that's how wonderful I think this
[1:09:08] message has brought Jesus Christ off the
[1:09:11] pages of the book I read the book I
[1:09:14] could quote see the book I could quote
[1:09:18] them the book I did I stayed in trouble
[1:09:22] all the time because I just tell people
[1:09:24] what the book said
[1:09:33] I thought we're supposed to believe the
[1:09:36] book and what the book said why did your
[1:09:42] profits at anyway he said you know I'm
[1:09:43] tell a woman this wrong cut her heart or
[1:09:46] why pants or which one is I know there's
[1:09:48] a direct quote the one part you don't
[1:09:51] have to tell the woman why cuz come on
[1:09:55] the church then you women you just sat
[1:10:01] down and grin for a little bit and think
[1:10:03] about it you don't have to tell you that
[1:10:05] it's wrong to do you know better okay
[1:10:18] let's kill knows that hey brothers how
[1:10:20] about it you know better well brother
[1:10:28] deal I just don't like you I never have
[1:10:31] liked myself let alone like anything yet
[1:10:35] but is it the truth of what I've said
[1:10:38] that's all I'm asking you salvation
[1:10:42] according to Jonah what is it two and
[1:10:44] nine of leaders are salvation is of the
[1:10:47] Lord we're talking about salvation
[1:10:52] salvation is deliverance salvation is a
[1:10:55] journey we started our journey when we
[1:10:58] started believing the Word of God and
[1:11:00] that journey brought us now you can sit
[1:11:02] back and look at it and think about
[1:11:04] we'll go through some of these and look
[1:11:06] where you come from to bring you into
[1:11:08] the message and to think what aggression
[1:11:13] God we have that would drop all the way
[1:11:20] down to where we had
[1:11:29] say it this way without you getting
[1:11:32] offended there is no grace in a
[1:11:39] prophetic message now listen to what I'm
[1:11:44] saying and don't just misunderstand it
[1:11:46] there's no grace in a prophetic message
[1:11:49] it is law because it's the word that
[1:11:52] says to do or don't do bring that
[1:12:01] prophet with his message to the New
[1:12:04] Testament and it becomes Grace but not
[1:12:13] disgrace right come on how many of you
[1:12:19] remember back about probably 70
[1:12:22] somewhere in there
[1:12:23] they started out about you know that
[1:12:26] brother Branham was an Old Testament
[1:12:27] prophet in a New Testament age I mean
[1:12:31] have you remember that before that be
[1:12:34] something that's what I told him I said
[1:12:35] I told him just what I say at this then
[1:12:37] I said boy ain't that something
[1:12:39] he's an Old Testament prophet so they
[1:12:42] ain't no grace in anything he says
[1:12:45] because he's a law teacher if he's a
[1:12:47] prophet of the Old Testament you better
[1:12:52] get him in the New Testament where
[1:12:54] you're at you get him where you're at
[1:12:57] then you can claim salvation then you'll
[1:13:00] understand
[1:13:01] come on musicians anybody got any
[1:13:05] thoughts about what I say I'll be glad
[1:13:07] to set in the office and listen to you
[1:13:10] we're glad for you to tell me where I'm
[1:13:13] wrong but you tell me if I'm wrong about
[1:13:16] salvation you tell me I'm wrong about
[1:13:19] the things that I believe that the
[1:13:22] prophet of God taught us
[1:13:30] he's the one that taught us that we're
[1:13:33] in a journey traveling through life he's
[1:13:42] the one that taught us that we're saved
[1:13:43] by grace through faith and as long as
[1:13:48] that salvation is the correct confession
[1:13:51] then it'll work but if not it'll stop
[1:13:55] well I always thought it once saved
[1:13:58] always saved that's true if you're once
[1:14:01] saved if you're once truly saved you're
[1:14:05] always saved that's true but if you're
[1:14:11] not saved better find a website version
[1:14:17] okay what do you think about it well I
[1:14:25] think brother Dale I'm massively
[1:14:26] confused good that gives you something
[1:14:28] to pray about I just don't understand
[1:14:34] you
[1:14:34] well good that'll give you something to
[1:14:36] pray about and while you're praying
[1:14:38] about that pray for me okay cuz contrary
[1:14:46] to what your thinking is I don't want
[1:14:47] nobody to be lost and I don't care who
[1:14:52] they are I want them saved I would to
[1:14:57] God the devil could be saved you know I
[1:15:03] don't hate him that away it it's kind of
[1:15:08] hard to listen to the Prophet sometimes
[1:15:11] and you know the Prophet how did he
[1:15:13] stated about the devil he's the best
[1:15:15] friend we got per phrasing it right but
[1:15:19] that's right isn't it devil is the best
[1:15:22] friend we got you know why cuz he's
[1:15:24] gonna get on our back and he's gonna
[1:15:26] beat us to death and he's gonna do all
[1:15:28] kind of things yeah but he ain't my
[1:15:32] buddy no he ain't my buddy
[1:15:34] but he's doing a good job trying to line
[1:15:36] us up
[1:15:41] well you love the devil no don't love
[1:15:45] the devil but he's a mighty good devil
[1:15:49] and he's doing his job what are we gonna
[1:15:53] do bless God devil I ain't gonna listen
[1:15:57] to you well and where do we go ahead
[1:16:00] brother
[1:16:00] let's stand together you say I don't
[1:16:02] understand what you're saying all right

[1:16:07] take it up with Lord willing winds that
[1:16:09] will try to drop back to where where
[1:16:10] everyone live out and start with a
[1:16:13] simple plan of salvation
