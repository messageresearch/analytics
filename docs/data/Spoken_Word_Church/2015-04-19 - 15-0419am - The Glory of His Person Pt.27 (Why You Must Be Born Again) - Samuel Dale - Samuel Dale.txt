we thank you in Jesus name amen don't let us forget I have a prayer cloth in handkerchief in my pocket that we will fix some more prayer claws this afternoon all right Revelations 1 we've been reading this for quite a while verse 12 and I turned to see the voice that spake with me and being turned I saw seven golden candlesticks and in the midst of the seven candlesticks one like unto the son of man clothed with a garment down to the foot and G about the pals with a golden girdle his head and his hairs were white like wool as white as snow and his eyes eyes were as a flame of fire and his feet like undefined brce as if they burned in a furnace and his voice as the sound of many Waters you say well you sure have read that a lot of times uh I remember one time that I read the same scripture 60 something services so it's not too bad to just keep reading it maybe we'll learn what it means you know all right John 3 there was a man of the Pharisees named Nicodemus a ruler of the Jews the same came to Jesus by night and said unto him Rabbi now notice he recognizes him Rabbi great something not just an average all right we know that thou art a teacher the teacher is uh you know would be uh bringing it to because he recognizes him as the teacher too in Israel and says um thou art a teacher come from God now what for no man can do the these Miracles that thou doest except God be with him now that's a great recognition right Jesus answered and said unto him verily verily I say unto thee except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of God Nicodemus sath unto him how can a man be born when he is old can he enter the second time into his mother's wound and be born Jesus answered verily verely I say unto theee except a man be born of water and of the spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom of God that which is born to the flesh is flesh and that which is born to the spirit is Spirit Marvel not that I say unto thee you must be born again you may be seated which trying to okay okay trying to get an understanding trying to get to a place to see who we are and what we're doing and uh you know what we're doing here as we were talking about it last night then this age is the age to where that everything is winding up and and the word is to be revealed in this age to bring us to that place and we thank the Lord for it now a lot of people seemingly in the message has gotten away from many years ago from preaching on the new birth it was just uh one of those things that you you're a Believer you believe the prophet uh you believe this you believe that and that means that you're saved well we'll get to that in a little bit and all because today I want to ask the the question is and we'll read what the prophet says in a minute but why must you be born again say well this is just a good old Baptist message you know well maybe sometimes we need a little good old Baptist message to understand what's going on and all but I didn't know we were to take out scriptures because we had Advanced so much into the word until the little things were not needed anymore uh I thought we were believing that you know uh we all the word all right now we've been speaking for quite a while about how that man is a triun being not to spend much time on this but to make a background part that he's a triun being he's Body Spirit and soul right and that makes him to be a person you know a man of a a a being and then speaking of how that God condescended down to Mankind and he comes that way through Body Spirit and soul all right and giving it to where they we would uh see that we were not only created In His Image in Genesis 1 but then he came in our image amen you know as to the things that we are and uh you know that's a wonderful part we can look at that and see it we see ourselves and we can see God in that part we see God and we can see ourselves because you know even the the Bible says the Eternal godhead can be understood by the things that we see amen all right then it's a wonderful thing to be able to follow it that way uh thank God for the message cuz we didn't know it that way amen we were just to the bases of this that or the other as we'll try to cover more in the message today but as I was making the point while ago what about a man that was you know and and Jesus says th the teacher you know in Israel in other words top he recognized him as to be a great uh leader he gave him a great compliment about him and talking about the teacher all right but see Jesus then but but Nicodemus didn't come to him just as an argumentive form of what that basically we do you know uh what do you believe you know uh what do you believe about this that or the other he came to him and he spoke to the man well when he spoke to the man the man didn't make anything derogatory as the other Pharisees and things did the man gave him a greater honor he says we know in other words that had to me more than just him amen we know that thou art a teacher because we recognize that you do bring us the word all right he said and you've got to be something about you that I even recognize you to say and call you Rabbi which can be many many many thoughts to related to calling him Rabbi you know of even father you know or different things great things but he said no man can do the things you do unless it be of God now that was a great compliment am or great thought especially in the day and hour when everything he would say 90% or more or 99% of the people would jump on to him about the things and you're a man making yourself God and and you know we know who you are and and you're born illegitimate you're you're this that or the other the only man that really gave him now even the Peter and all of them that followed him and and all of that Nicodemus was giving him a whole lot more greater uh position and placing him in a con a situation of bragging on him right well what about after all of that Jesus would look at him and say Nicodemus you must be born again y well he never heard words like that before right in his understanding but way do we get down and read a quote in a minute you know that brother Brown said Nicodemus if you hadn't just hadn't have stayed with your traditional ideas you would have know I come to die for the sins of man and see then but here's this great man giving all of these things and Jesus said you must be born again well Nicodemus didn't paraphrase it in the words we will and say why must I be born again he knew the man was talking about something but he couldn't comprehend it and so he goes to the Natural thought and he saids you mean I've got to go back into my mother and come out again and and Jesus kind of B how do you use that brated him belated him he he kind of went put him down a little bit he said you're a teacher and you don't understand these things and see Nicodemus he he couldn't follow it but yet see we come along and we say but poor Nicodemus here's a good Baptist you know poor nicod all he had to do is believe well you're not listening to the statements I just made he believed this man to be from God he believed this man to be a great teacher he even recognized him and called him Rabbi he would say God is with you he sounds like a pretty good believer and he did get to Jesus right come and talk to him right where the others wouldn't talk to him sound like a pretty good believer but see that's one of the thoughts as we'll get to in a minute that when you know you you you try to say something to people about the new birth and well I've got the new birth now you you'd have to be with understand me but you keep on you'll find it out brother dick I tell him things he'll go find him a good Baptist one these days and a good old Baptist would tell him I got the Holy Ghost I got the new birth he may not use the word Holy Ghost cuz he don't like that afraid of ghost you know but he may use the word Holy Spirit but he the reason he say he said the reason I've guided it come on to death Pentecost well what's that got to do with it you know right I mean did it come on the day of Pentecost means you got it so think about it the most religious sincere wonderful person and Jesus never brought anything up against him in his life never said a thing he just say you must be born again amen he couldn't follow that line right now Jesus could have reminded him you you remember that the the Bible speaks of the uh Christ child he would agreed with it he said you know he could have reminded him that God was going to be a man right you know he could have told him a lot of things and and Nicodemus would have agreed with him if you understand what I mean this is a sincere man coming to ask the question not a man that does like we do okay I quote brother Brandon he said the biggest portion of the people asked the question and said they're not listening to your answer they're waiting on you to shut up where they can refute what you said that's kind of a paraphrase quote it's close enough right but this man was very sincere very humble very good man amen and he says You must be born again now brother brand on the message you must be born again they can pull these up as we go along if they want to but I don't think it's necessary to that much but he said that this was the first Doctrine that's right of the Lord Jesus amen right what it you must be born again all right and he says goes on and says it's a very deep one but yet we think the new birth is just some shallow something it's just you know it's going to take us months in this relation to the new birth for to cover this so don't get dragged out on it if I repeat a lot of things and keep bringing out a lot of things because we're going to get into some things that maybe you had never tied together as to thinking about the New Birth all right and like brother brandham would say I can conclusively prove that you're born again right and then baptize into the body then we've got the ones we've just got to covering a lot where he says you you say you got the baptism of the Holy Spirit he says you can have that every day of your life and be lost right all right he says you believe unto eternal life right but you're baptized into the body by the Holy Spirit now those things have got to be brought in brought out into an order for us as human beings to follow it and to understand that all of those things are right uh we we're not ones to say we'll take so many these things but we won't take this cuz that don't sound too good you know well I the day I get to be doing that I'll stop quoting brother brandham as a prophet you know all right but just think about it the first doctrine that the Lord Jesus brought was you must be born again right amen all right the beginning Doctrine would be the most important one you said no it was this or that no there is no need of talking about them things until you're born again that's the thing that I've tried my best for almost 50 years of studying this message 40 something years as a matter of fact this 4th of July will be 40 years pastoring here that you know for all of that time is to try to get us away from this little petty ideas and thoughts and get down to the seriousness of God's word Jesus didn't say you need to be as we'll read the minute you ought to be and maybe it's okay to do it no he put it there and he said verily verily which means that anytime God says something double times you pay attention to what he's saying more than you the other times that he just says verely because he's emphasizing something you know he's bringing it out into the open unto you and and read the Bible for yourself and learn the things for your own you know and study the word of God but a very deep subject is you must be born again I think it's so deep until that's why most people don't preach on it right sure okay but is't it odd here comes along an old Baptist that when I started trying to preach about what I saw about the New Birth 40 or something or 50 almost 40 something years ago the first sermon was that the Bride of Jesus Christ would be the son of man and that was in Athens Georgia 19 1969 and uh a good old Baptist that still believes in justification sanctification the baptism of the Holy Ghost you know and to see the Pentecostals of this message do as brother Bram said if you Pentecostals won't go in what did he say he said he'll raise up abst and Methodist right well okay but to see that most of the people of this message no longer teach justification sanctification the baptism of the Holy Ghost is the new birth that's right it's just some act or form as you do whatever you know or some legalistic form as we'll get to the end of the message where brother Brown said when it says You must be born again he said we want to tell the people what to do and not to do he said the Philippian Jailer didn't ask the question like that he ask what must I do to be born again he says we tell them what to do or not to do right we tell them to quit this we tell them to quit that not do that and do that that's not what the man asked about he asked how to be born again well now it's believe the message well okay that's everybody their own idea I still believe the same thing I believe back then when I came into this message and heard brother Brown talking about justification sanctification the baptism of the Holy Ghost I knew immediately that I was not born again yet I was a deacon in a Baptist Church for about about fromwhere into 5 years I was teaching the adult Sunday School classes when I left from there which was the deacons and Elders the elderly people of the church that's what I was doing but yet I saw that I was not born again I've seen God when I was 11 years old I've had great experiences with God in my life but none of those do I count as the new birth okay that what most people would be glad to say is their evidence I don't say that amen because evidences is getting into attributes we'll read what the prophet has to say about it you know smoking drinking gambling and stuff like that it's not a sin right what is it it's an attribute of unbelief amen well why would you want to tell somebody something and somebody come up to the alar I want to be born again well you need to do this you need to do that you need to do that you need to quit this you need to believe the message well that's good amen wonderful but that's not the question since when have you heard someone preach on that you need to repent repent believe on the Lord Jesus Christ repent and get baptized and then you need to follow the word and be Sanctified by the word that's right and then you need to receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost I hope everybody's got it all figured out how that comes to pass well don't okay if it's right right how would you like for the prophet it says it we'll read it in a minute he says there's nine over 900 different churches now that's that's that's way back and it's about that meaning the message right you understand what I mean doctrines and ideas right and he said if we ask every one of them we'd get 900 different understandings that's right well all right but what do you put yours on the question is why must you be born again that was the question Nicodemus was asking in a simple terminologies of thinking he was saying I got to go back to my mother I got to do this would you please explain to me what I need to do and and the best that I see that I need to do is according to what you're teaching that if I was born once I need to be born again and and that way I need to go back to my mama's wound and come out again in simple plain language Jesus said that wouldn't help you you you'd come out a two-fold child of hell if you went back and could come back again it wouldn't do you any good but why must you be born again now for heaven's sakes don't lay it on how good you were in your life you know don't put it on I never done this or I never done that CU we'll go with the Apostle Paul and say a Pharisee of the Pharisees a Hebrew of the Hebrews concerning the law blameless but you know what he had to be born again he had to be born again struck down by great light y called it Lord right brother BR said he would have no way the man would have no way recognized that to be the Lord had he not known that's who it was but he winds up over there in a little hole somewhere and he's blind right until a man comes yep and speaks the word to him his eyes is opened and he receive the new birth so let's don't go on any thoughts or ideas if you don't get nothing out of the message today get that cuz that's what we'll be on for quite a while of dealing with this because you know I'm accused of being so deep that I bring out things that people can't follow well and let me say it the deepest thing this morning I can think of is you must be born again now you want me to prove that to you the prophet said one of the Mysteries in this day was the receiving of the new birth without a sensation we'll read in maybe this afternoon but it's either morning or afternoon where brother Brown says the new birth is a mystery yes it is amen right right it was so much a mystery until it was hidden totally to the Old Testament people yet we're on this side of it you know what they say about it Hinds side is 220 or something like that or you know you can always see behind you because what's been but like I started off while ago saying you know we can say all that Nicodemus had to do was believe the poor old fell I mean all he had to do was believe well I I would like sometimes for you to study Matthew Mark Luke and John and in that would you follow a line in Matthew Mark Luke and John and would you write down every time that it was spoken of about the belief that's right or believing or believeth that's right amen you know he that believeth in his baptized shall be saved don't say the baptism saves you but I wish you would just go through it and and write down believe believe us or believed or whatever when a disciples come along one day and they said now we believe and even Jesus one day referring do you now believe right they still wasn't born again come to run like a bunch of chickens when it come time for for Jesus in this crucifixion right right but a few days later they wouldn't run in at all right right cuz they had something that anchored within them right of their own experience now don't ever think that brother Dale believes that you can't have the Holy I mean that you can have the Holy Ghost without an experience you'll never find that in brother Brown's message I want to see it he says you got to have an experience but he'll say you can have it without a sensation a sensation remember according to Webster and that's the only thing we got to go by is a English language it means a sensation means an ex a a stimulation upon your fleshly being you know through your spirit of things an experience is something you live through yes sir amen all right I had a first birth I live through that all right well then what would my second birth be and why would I need that second birth well let me just read to you and let him let him then that way that's the reason I like to read a lot of the Prophet says to you or give you the quotes because that way it's not my words you know because on 90 90% of the people are not going to go look up what you say they're going to remember what they thought he said and they're not going to like I was telling them yesterday about it uh at church one time and I said well brother R said so and so and this person said he didn't say that I said well he did said no I just listened to that tape and he didn't say that I just went and got the book and laid it down I said well there's something different between the tape and the book because according to this book right here supposed to be that he says this well I didn't know he said that you know sometimes we sleep through things and it's not always sleeping through things it's just our mind blanks out no brother Dale I said glued in and that's when you're glued out because your mind doesn't work that way some of you're worried about dinner and whether your stuff's going to be any good today or not cuz we're going to eat together and all the way through the service you'll be concerned about that right that's human I do the same I remember brother Jeff I laughed at him one time he figured out how to fix a tractor or something listening to a service here at the church I said boy you really enjoyed it didn't you but he said it just come to him how to fix that tractor he was locked in good all right well why must you be born again that's right if your lineage is so great and you were wonderful and you came over on the May flow okay you know your lineage everything's beautiful down to there nobody committed any adulterous acts nobody ever had was no divorcement in the family no no things and it's all beautiful line all the way down for 20 Generations well what does it matter P are you still going to hit something but see we think there some reason that God saved us well what would be a good reason that he would save you now I know what the biggest portion of the message people believe he saves you because he put a seed in you well according to my understanding I believe what he said about the seed I believe that but they failed to quote this one that that he put the seat in you before the foundation of the world they don't want to quote those things they don't like to follow let's go ahead with number two and let's think about it off the message you must be born again cuz I would invite you to listen there's two I believe two messages seem like one in the 50s this one is 61 uh 12:31 uh no excuse me this one is from 58 uh 819 the one that we were right above there quoting from which says about two or three messages but look what he says and when Jesus said to this great ruler you must be born again then why must I be born again that's what I want to know now look at him if I'm a minister of the Gospel if I'm a good person and I pay my debts and I'm just and honest and walk upright before men what more could god require of me all right now relate this to Nicodemus in the situation of the great life that he was living but related to brother randam in the great life that he was living right why must I have some kind of an experience as people tell me that I must be born again why did Jesus say to this ruler who lived high and holy and was requested that now what are not requested but commanded that he must be born again amen great man but you must be born again look what he says on spoken word is the Original Seed number three of our thoughts paragraph 12122 then except a man be born again why must he be born again he's dead the flesh is in why must you be born again he's dead right the Bible says that the person that lives say the woman lives in pleasure is dead while she liveth see we're every one dead right amen from Eve sin right right we're born in Sin from Eve sin in the garden all right no hopes whatsoever far us we're born dead now watch what he goes on to say he's a hybrid all right a hybrid cannot reproduce itself right that's right it won't come back sure now okay come on you can take you take corn you plant it and a hybrid and you plant the next year you get a stalks you get this but you get old naughty looking things you don't get nowhere nothing right we're not so far off until we don't know a little bit but look he's a hybrid he's dead he's a hybrid he's got to be born again why he was born in Sin from Eve sin shaping in iniquity come to the world speaking lies he's a liar to begin with no matter how smart educated what more he is he's a liar the Bible says he is how holy his parents was or anything about it he's a liar to begin with now you don't like that cuz I don't make it as a joke but you look down at that little baby that you're holding you say Hey Little Liar how you doing see you you think you're throwing off on the baby no no I'm throwing off on you okay I mean if you're going to get your feelings hurt for me saying something about you baby get your feelings hurt for me saying something about you you were the liar that brought it here right but see that doesn't have anything to do with it see that would go into what is this or how good or what you you can't do it right well look he's a hybrid I think I've got it in here I'm sure I'll use it but brother Ram said I'm a hybrid he said don't matter where you're priest king or who you are you're a hybrid now that you back up just a Hur you know because see your honor into that and that's wonderful that's all right but just remember he had to be born again that's right when you put it to the bases that brother brandom never had to be born again then you're making him go God that's right now you got your deities into the line cuz he was a human being just like the rest of us all right but he's a hybrid he was born in the eve sin now we we're you know uh we quote a lot of times scripture um when it's really a little bit offline from what we say born in sin sheap in iniquity come to the world speaking lies that's that's not verbatim that's saying what it means because you get into Psalms 51 it says behold I was shapen in iniquity and in sin did my mother conceive me all right then you go into Psalms uh 58 and 3 The Wicked are strange from the wound they go astray as soon as they are born speaking lies all right now I thought of something Wednesday night I really enjoyed brother Bob's message and I admit I got lost in my own thoughts for a little while because I I don't say that's wrong for you to do it when it's in the right order cuz I was thinking about something that he made me think of you know language is an ability to communicate you know there's thousands of thousands of different languages in the world and you know God can understand every one of them it doesn't matter as brother ROM would say is they say goo goo gaga he said that means something in their language all right but you know language being the ability to communicate then you must understand what each one's doing but you know that person like I said there the other day it you know we could say in English uh let's go to town maybe Spanish it says to town we go I just you know I'm not a major on those things I just uh saying it as a point but you know there is a thought in the word of God that brings out God the word of God brings God's thoughts to whatever language we are and I remember brother uh Dan daisley speaking here one night it's the only time I've ever in my life seen anything to me now a talking about something else but brother uh done go I'll think of it a minute brother LeAndre brother from from Venezuela believe that's right he was speaking and brother daisley was interpreting for him well I wasn't following the words to be able to understand but I I got into the thought with brother LeAndre as to what he was saying and there was no way that I'm telling you this other than an honor but I begin brother daisley with stone for words and I was sitting there and I tell him the words to say and he I guess he was shocked he probably thought I was understanding no I was understanding the thought that was being presented right that way you get away from your own concept or what your word means you know because if you have and you know I make light not of people in their language but I I make a thought a point I say in English we say dog well what is it in Spanish see p petrol everything not gas but the P something what is it in Zimbabwe where sister dogy okay what is it in uh all right we've got about four or five different words relating to the word dog and that's what I asked everybody I say sister when you think are you thinking of dog and they said yeah I said why don't you say dog well they do say dog but it's their language that the word they use that means dog see it's uh It's ability to communicate because if you don't do it that way you're going to make the educated to be superior right and then you're falling out of the scriptures that the Common People heard him gladly he spoke their language he said things are s of Southern maybe as Paul would say you all you know well Lord great you're great for us but do you understand what I'm getting at all right now there's many ways that we're going to approach a thought not today now so I'm laying this attit time where you won't get when we get there you won't get confused and say he's doing it there's many ways we're going to have to approach this point of why you must be born again and then what is the new birth and and how do you know you got it and the evidences and things we're going to approach it from many different ways but remember my thought will be the same no matter if the prophet says you're born again baptize into the body in no way are we going to try to correct him CU that'd be stupidity right right but we've got to get the thought that's involved now that's the only way that I can go with it I'm sorry to not to try to change nothing that's what people of the message do brother BR said oh when was that that was in his early Ministry all I want is after that's not me not say all I want is after the seals broke cuz that is the spoken word I can take the definition of the new birth from 65 up and say one thing I can take it from 65 down or 63 down and say something else and both of them be correct but you'll think I'm mly confused see you you you think that I just try to be a smart elic and when that for many many many years and you've probably heard it 20 times in the past 27 services that where brother brandham would explain in his early Ministry Body Soul and Spirit but then in the later part of his ministry he would say Body Spirit and soul but he never changed the senses of the position that he brought C taste feel smelling here for the body second real memory reason conscious affections Etc third one was either Faith or doubt and see that way you can tie the message together through the entire thing you don't have to deny anything because most of you never came through the old two Soul people their point was always laying about the soul we get a New Soul that's a quote then you say we get a new spirit that's a quote like we were talking the other day about you know you you you well why must you be born again let's just approach it from there and go on well we've read that we're dead and according to Colossians 2:13 and you being dead in your sins and uncircumcision of your flesh but he has to be quickened having forgiven you all trespasses so then we're dead while we're living right amen right why would God refer refer to a person being living to be proof that you're living and yet say you're dead well we're getting to a point it's pretty good now that you know that they're computerizing everything so much until it won't be long you can't prove it you're living and you you go down to the bank and say I'm Donnie faush I've come to check out some we have no record of Donnie faush according to our records and the Bureau of Senses we have no donif fa Bush and you're standing there trying to prove your Al and they say prove your alive and we'll give you this okay but listen High breeding brought death spoken words Original Seed paragraph 142 he said she's hybrid he said I'll ask you why what's these funerals and things about she was a hybrid every one of us are hybrid from the original that's the reason you're constantly dying right all right is because that we were born wrong all right and see even the original when we get into it this afternoon and where that that Jesus says You must be born again the original translation says You must be born from above but see does that change our thoughts so here it is off spoken word Original Seed number 7A go ahead and then pull it up but every man no matter whether he's a pope priest bishop or whatever he is he dies because he he he's a hybrid that's exactly he was born between Satan and Eve and they called it whatever you want to it was Satan and Eve the original word had nothing to do with it was a hybrid it brought death no my Mom and Daddy was married what that got to do with it you know I mean I know the point you're making you're trying to make a purity of yourself you're trying to make a lineage of yourself hey there's nobody in the building that love their mama anymore my mom raised us nine of us that even four died young and nine of us I'm the baby of 13 and she raised us you think I don't honor her I honored her so much until when she told me to be at home at 10:00 I was at home at 10:00 I can stand here and say that she could raise and tell you it's true I was late one time I apologized to her when I got home because I knew and I could hear her she wasn't to sleep till I went to bed I honor her but you know what my mother wouldn't a saint maybe you think your is worse and I don't mind saying it because I honored I just give that honor she could have had all kind of affairs with men well you're not talk like that about your mama I'm just trying to be honest and straight cuz that's the way I am is straight and it wouldn't matter she was pure and holy all the way through what a back behind that what a back behind that hey come on but we came over on the Mayflower I don't know how the Dales got here there probably was a stowaway on the ship somewhere cuz I know they wouldn't worth very much you think this the honor all I try to tell it like it is I say my kids what their Halo was held up by horns the grandkids are the same way the great grand kids are the same way that's not throwing off on anybody that's truth you don't know what lineage you're from but irregardless what does it matter and how great the prophet could speak it they were born between Satan and Eve now watch he never said that's why you don't have that you got the seed of the serpent you're dealing with you don't have the seed of the Beast right right it doesn't mention seed of the Beast come on it's the seed of the serpent who's the serpent Satan Why didn't it say well some people is born between Eve and the Beast but we were born between Eve and Adam and do you know that a lot of the ministers this message preach out lineages Paul said you keep lineages I'm scared of you all right what good is it but to realize that we're all lost and born between Satan and Eve do you realize then what he's saying and what the scriptures I've given to you in sin did my mother conceive me he wasn't saying that he was illegitimate right he knew who his daddy was and his mama right he was just saying it like it meant right repr uction of what the big old words y'all use for it I just say reproduction getting kids here you know that simply comes by a sex act I have never heard of anything more doing it other than these implants they have today but you know what implants got to come from somewhere so I don't make no difference how it gets tired ain't got nothing to do with it it got tired it had to be a a a egg from a woman and a seed from the man or germ or whatever the terminologies you use to bring a child all right they have never been able to create either one of them right because that would be a creating life they can't do it but you see we're all born between Satan and Eve and that way we don't glory in the flesh that's we know we thank God for people see right I mean for people to say that I never done this or never done that that's wonderful right but I don't save you that's right amen I can say that the only drink I've ever taken was a communion wine but that don't save me as a matter of fact it makes me on the wrong side of the situation and Paul would say of all of the great things what did he say about himself he said I'm chiefest of Sinners what does that mean to be chiefest that means you're the closest to the truth and there he was all of those great things and this great Nicodemus standing here all of those great things that Jesus never brought one thing against him and said well now Nicodemus reading you need to be born again it says because I can look back through your lineage and way back under that you don't know about but you're great great great great great great great great grandma done something wrong he didn't go through that he probably could look back through the mandoline and see that he didn't do any of it but what did that do he turned to a man and said you must be born again what about you and I amen what about it let's jump a few we'll bring them back later go over to quote number 10 which is you must be born again 1961 and he says now out of there there are so many different meanings that people put to it you must be born again see as it St nearly all churches say that you must be born again but each one has their their different interpretations to that what it means to be born again I might go to the Methodist church this morning they say we believe that you must be born again how do you interpret it I go to the Baptist Church we believe you must be born again how do you interpret it I would do to and I would go to each church and we'd find if we went to all 900 different denomination of churches there'd be 900 different interpretations right that's right look like a couple agree but you know the point look going on down reading what did he say now remember it didn't say you ought to be born again but you must now we as English-speaking people understand what the word must means that is it's absolutely you got to do it see it's a must not you ought to you'd be better off if you did but you must be born again amen oh if we could just take that word this morning and break it down what it means how that it's totally impossible and then if it's that essential and that great that it's totally impossible to enter the kingdom of heaven or even see it until you're born again and so many different interpretations of that word born again we ought to seek it out with all of our heart to find out what it means what does it mean you must be born again now as I said 900 different he says well then you got about 900,000 this message of all kind of ways and ideas of saying there's a reason you know you're born again is because but well let's just read the next one let him say things then you can't argue with you can argue with me you can cut me off and a little computer look what he says off the investment 1963 let not these words be in vain you must be born again you must now I'm not talking about you might scream shout speak with tongues I mean being born again now watch him really with with that deep confession of sin that's right all right let's read the next one where we get our thought Hebrews chapter 5 and six now speaking in tongues shouting in there that's just attributes that follow this kind of a life all right and you can take impersonate these attributes and never have that life we see it how many knows that's the truth surely surely we ought to know that look what he drops down to paragraph 11 141 I've seen Visions in the sick healed the dead raised when they're laying out dire and the doctors walk away and say they're finished and gone lay there a couple of hours in the Holy Spirit come right down and show a vision go down there and raise that person up I've seen those who are deaf dumb blind crippled well that's just attributes read it that's just attributes we like to talk about and we'll use it with drinking G and smoke and it just attributes it's unbelief but what does he saying all of these things that you do it's just attri Utes you cry you shout you believe you walk you do you do see the dead rais that's what he's saying he said you can impersonate any of those attributes well all right upon what basis do you put it because the Bible is saying You must be born again but why must you be born again cuz if you don't admit you need to be born again you will never be born again that's why that I've told you how many years have I made this statement I would to God I could preach a sermon that every person in this building including myself would realize if they are lost that they could say I'm lost and let me do something about it now not try to build a church up full of Sinners that's why I Don't Preach to bodies and Spirits I look you in the eye when I'm talking to you cuz I want you to look me in the eye and listen to what I'm saying right I'm not trying to discern your spirit that doesn't work right cuz if I discerned a lot of your spirits I'd be in bad shape if you discern mine you'd be in bad shape you know but why must you be born again cuz you're born wrong amen but I I'm a good person I've been a good person all of my life praise the Lord so was Nicodemus so was the great Apostle Paul but they had to be born again that's right so was brother brandham don't smoke Don't drink don't chew cuz it'll work for you one day but he didn't have any trouble explaining that he had to be born again and even the things that he would say and I will admit there are a lot of statements that must be put together because one time he'll be in the Woodshed the next time we'll be running down the railroad track the next time he'll be doing this or that or the other there are different ways he would speak of his new birth because that's just PL doings talking you know you tell me something one day and the next day you'll tell me something you'll add a few words to it or leave out a few words right that's human beings but see none of those his shouting speaking running down the railroad track none of that was his new birth right right that was attributes he wasn't against shouting right he was not against speaking in tongues he was not against crying and screaming and all of those things he believed in them every one of them he said he done every one of them but he never put any of it as to be his new birth a baby is born it's is born is alive then it starts crying right starts screaming starts doing why those are just attributes of an alive baby that's not your birth the birth was when the baby got here spank it or whatever and it come to life but then it does those things well brother Dale you're trying to tell me I'm lost if I can convince you brother Al can I quote brother you brother Al brother Al said I wish you'd go up part to brother Dale and let him talk you out of your what you think you know God if you can talk you out of it you don't know it I ain't hindering nobody that's born again that's right and the ones that would hinder is proving you're not born again see if you're having doubts about things because of what I'm saying to you then you're the one that's got the problem and you need to work on it you need something to where you can say this is my experience let me anchor down here do we want to profit he said take a steak drive it downen sir see then you can say Satan do what you want to that took place back there here's the date here's the time here's what done now you just go on and if it's real he'll go on but if it ain't he going to make you do everything in the world but do you understand why you must be born again cuz you're born wrong am right Born wrong you're dead that's why I've always tried to get you to see those things that those Old Testament Saints no matter how great they were and honorable right they needed to be born again right amen right amen all right then we go over in scripture because it says that that Jesus had not been you know the Holy Ghost had not been given all right that's Wonder we got the quotes we've got the thought but why not take it in plain simple language he that is born of a woman is full of Sorrows right troubles and but hey thank God we got here yeah right right amen and I wouldn't care I don't I don't mean this to derogatory to my mother or water I wouldn't care if if if I was illegitimate all the way back to the Garden right amen amen if every parent I had leading back went straight to Cain boy the preacher this message I hear him on that he don't believe in the no I don't believe in all that garbage you talk about that's right amen amen I believe the Bible that said to Cain would you not have been received if you'll go do what your brother done I'll accept you now you go read the Bible and see what it says but see no no we we're so holy my lineage come on it's been in the message you that been around a while you know what I'm saying true they've always brought two lineages absolutely a lineage coming from Adam a lineage coming from the Beast through Cain that's right and if you was born of Adam you can be saved but if you born from the cane you can't be saved now that's the biggest garbage can that could ever be amen that's right right amen because you'd be B Mak it on the basis of who my mom and daddy happened to be you wouldn't be giving me a choice righten and even my mom and daddy would give a choice Adam and Eve that's right right sure but you'd be making me to worth it so you're not seeing why you must be born again you're trying to make it so holy the reason I come into this message I never done like you if I had done the things you done the Lord would have never saved me oh it's wonderful isn't it you remember the story that I told you one time about the man that told me that I kept trying to get him to get baptized he finally got baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ but he talked to his wife and she wasn't going to do it and she wound up saying that God come in the hospital room and poured water over her and baptized her in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ because he didn't know now this is the word because God didn't know whether she was going to live or not to be able to go out and get back baptized now that's what the man said and I don't care if he went there in the bed was floa I don't care if the room was full of water so I being the mean God that I am I asked him a simple question I said in other words you say you're wife says that God baptized her he said yes that's right I said now brother if if I come to you and told you this story most of you know what I'm saying some of you know who it was I said if I come and told you this story that my wife said God come in a hospital room and poured water over her and baptized her I said would you believe my wife was right he said no brother I just don't think I could believe your wife I just never did talk to him no more you know why because his wife was a woman preacher whether she ever preached a sermon or not she doesn't preach the doctr to him the same way Eve did in the garden and he was not going to go against her that's right right he believed her but he wouldn't believe my wife you see 97 different ways of trying to answer the question that you must be born again from shouting to speaking in tongues to crying to seeing Vision seeing Angels speaking the word of the Lord do you realize that in the Psalms that it's actually the prophets were speaking as the personal God right the psalmist David Solomon one the two what would he cry they pierced my hands and my feet you remember the Ethiopian unic you remember he said this man talking about himself as he speaking about another right speaking to first person and still be lost as far as the humanity cuz old Those Old Testament Saints could not be born again because you got to have the death of the testator right it's like I was you know I say this to you and I don't do it to be funny or anything like that I say to most people say turn to the first book of the New Testament some of you would probably even do it right now you'd turn to Matthew and want to read it to me that ain't the first book of the New Testament the first book of the New Testament is the book of Acts because in Matthew Mark Luke and John the testator had not died there was no new birth even though he breathed on them at the end right in the last days he breathed on them and said receive you the Holy Ghost but it was not given P until Pentecost the New Testament started on the day of Pentecost that's why Jesus told the people come on Jesus told the people in the gospels right to go offer the sacrifice of Moses am I in the Bible read Matthew Mark Luke and John you might find a lot of other things that's right read it for yourself he said go offer the offering of Moses go wash in the pool go do this right because he was still under the law himself that's right the Bible said he came under the law to redeem them that were under the law that we may be able to be the children of God paraphrasing the last part right but see we think it was just believing we'll get to that one too it's just believing well when I say unto you you must be born again what do you say back I've done this I've done that now let me end the last one with a quote from the prophet he said that Cain offered his sacrifice you know and he believed what he was bringing was the correct one and he says it one day like this about Cain he said Cain said to God I've done all I'm going to do he said take it or leave it now that enough was enough to let you know what kind of a spirit he had amen right in the face of God to say take it or leave it come on Brothers I've done all I'm going to do I've offered my sacrifice you set for me to do it I've done it that's why I love the scriptures where it says you know that you're not you're paraphrasing but it says you're your offerings your things has become a stink in my nostrils I don't look to that he said but I look to a man with with an honest and a contrite heart what's the difference in David committing adultery or anybody else committing adultery but yet Joe Blow as we call him was killed because of what he done but David Nathan himself had to speak it but he said David you call down your own judgment cuz David said bring the man in other words I'll kill him he said You' brought your own judgment but said you won't die he said God done told me you ain't going to die amen well what was so good about David oh he was a God I've always love David because of one thing he had an honest and a contrite heart scoi even verifies the same thing brother brandham said maybe that's where he got he said that David on his way home from the bed with basba cried out in his heart return unto me the joy of thy salvation he had that honest and a contrite heart cuz there was no way to take away the nature that was within the man he went back and had a dozen more kids out of women he capture from different people and done all kind of dirty things but yet in the Bible he's called a man after God's Own Heart I'd rather see somebody that's honest and straight than to see all the goodness we could do because we're still all facing why must we be born again l 10 because we were born wrong born lost go ahead brother 206 inal book anybody have a need and we're going to eat together Here My Cry anybody have a need not me by right I'm singor save here my own is that your desire Lord I know why I need to be born again the Lord do something about it I come to you with an honest heart and Lord forgive me you know we have to ask for be forgiveness what Mom and Daddy done just not a lineages of what somebody done the Bible said it would come a time that the children wouldn't the mama wouldn't eat grapes or the parents and the children the teeth be on it cuz that would not apply comes a time when you answer to guard yourself you got to talk to him yourself don't in no way try to approach him with how good you are you say Lord forgive me Lord forgive me you're my while on not B me only in th home Save Me by thy Grace sing it unto him and think about him you blessed what goodness do I have that I could present none that's why Jesus said come unto me all you that labor are heavy laden and I'll give you rest ain't nothing you can take just lay yourself on the altar say Lord let me die to myself spring of all my come more than life to me how high Earth we C your blessing hear my humble cry th do not me saor the new birth today is the same as it was back there in the book of Acts it took the disciples three and a half years to come to a place of being Believers to come to a place of being Sanctified cleansed and set aside to where they could receive the new birth yet they had raised the dead healed the sick cast out Devils even Judas was a part of that Ministry but yet he failed to make it to Pentecost well Judas just couldn't be saved upon what do you Bas it save hear my AR more why on others down amen and amen and amen white tells me they're getting together a good bit of money to be able to send to the Philippines and things to help those people and we thank you for all that you're doing to try to help and to do and and all to uh you know to help those brothers and sisters and what they're doing if you ever went to some of those countries and see it even the ones that are here that live there uh you know maybe they don't see it like we see it because they live there and they don't think much of about it but you go there and see them and the way they lived and the way they're doing and then you come back home and and you just want to had three three full luggages going to Jamaica the first time clothes packed everything was tight candy to the kids but still a lot of it was three-piece luggage you know big and you know I came back without one stitch of clothing well I said did you even give away your underclothes I said they got washing machines they can wash them I gave away everything I had because when you see them to think that they have no opportunity like we do and see them to be poor people but yet to be good people happy people it's no joke to what they say that in the Philippines if you see a man with a frown on his face that he's faking it because they're happy people Jamaica they're happy people but I did see some standing there that I looked at him and I cried I could see in their eyes no hopes I said brother r please please take the gospel to these people cuz they don't have no hope whatsoever in anything else take the gospel to him if you've never done that to be able to look in the set of eyes of a person that has no hopes and then look in comparison to a person that has Jesus Christ in their heart you can see an entirely difference if you're even spiritual at all you can see that they do have hopes and thoughts where others has none that's right you just want to give everything away to try to help them that's right come that's just the way it is you think about it God keeps up and knows who's helpen with what we do too and we thank you for the needs and the helps you know amen and the things that we've been able to do over the years to be able to send thousands of thousands of dollars to the foreign field that's right to help those people that we could have took and stuck it in our pocket and bought a new car you know but yet we had never chose to do that he just chose to try to exist as well we can and we do good but to go back and see those countries after you there the first time and then go back years later and see them and just just to see how the econom is a little better the first time we were in Jamaica man you were riding in cars with no shocks you just and there wasn't no door handles cuz it' all been knocked off there wasn't any mirrors on them and you'd just be going somewhere and the thing would get hot and it have to stop and put water in or do something or probably you know get on a little further and and you never seen it to where they be running on tires that I told you about I saw the tires on a car one night when they drove in and I thought that's a funny look I've never seen a tire like that and there was things sticking out the side of the tire you know and it was just flopping I thought that's the old polyester they didn't have the radio I said that's the old polyester tire and the Treads was that look at the tire and not one da was Tre on the tire and running on the inner lining I said yeah I'm driving like crazy through the mountains we I said brother put a set of tires on that car tomorrow here's the money you just don't even think about it but now they have got up modern and more modern at they have some pretty nice cars and and they're doing good but still when you're considering it it's $40 to one on at least or 46 or maybe more to every dollar you got you could take a $100,000 American dollars go buy you a beachfront property of 2 or 3 acres and build you one of the finest homes in the country for $100,000 builds you a castle for that amount of money and you just don't even think about it I guess we're getting about ready anyhow we'll go ahead and pray and start on father just talking a little bit while waiting on them to get through and get ready for the dinner that we're lunch that we're having today Lord we pray that you would just bless us all together in you we ask you to sanctify the food and us together as we eat together in Fellowship Lord around your word we love you we thank you for all the things that you've given unto us made possible for each and every one of us we love you we thank you guide us now sanctify the food and the people in Jesus name we ask it amen your dismiss
