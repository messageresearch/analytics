to church just to be here Lord I come to receive from you Lord just help us tonight we pray we commit all things to to you in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen Hagi chapter one beginning at verse one and it says in the second year of Darius the king and the sec in the sixth month in the first day of the month came the word of the Lord by Hagi the prophet unto unto zerubabel the son of shtiel the governor of Judah and to Joshua the son of joshc the high priest saying thus speaketh the Lord of hosts saying this people say the time is not is not come the time that the Lord's House should be built then came the word of the Lord bagga the prophet saying is it time for you oh ye to dwell in your sealed houses and this house lie waste now therefore thus sayith the Lord of hosts consider your ways you have swn much and bring in little you eat but ye have not enough you drink but you are not filled with drink you clothe you but there is none warm but he that earnthenecklace consider your ways go up to the mountain go to the mountain and bring wood and build the house cuz that's the house we're building and I will take pleasure and I will be glorified sayith the Lord that's right amen you look for much and lo it came to little and when you brought it home I did blow upon it why thus sayith the Lord of hosts because of mine house that is waste and you run every man unto his own house therefore the heaven over you is stayed from Dee and the Earth is stayed from her fruit and I called for a drought upon the land and upon the mountains and upon the corn and upon the new wine and upon the oil and upon that which the ground bringeth forth and upon men and upon cattle and upon all the Labor uh all all the labor of the hands and this is from 1 Peter 1:2 and it says ye also as Lively stones are built up a spiritual house and holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God by Jesus Christ amen God bless you you may be seated and I was looking at something the other day and I was looking at some things that brought me to this brought me to this scripture and we know that when the children of Israel they came out of Babylonian captivity we know that they came back and they were were given the word to to build rebuild the Temple and we know that uh you know Cyrus was King when he allow and he was allowed when things opened up so they could come back into build the temple they actually able to come back into Jerusalem which was the was the promised land when they came out of captivity and when they when they came back you know we know Nehemiah and Ezra were there you know they had a desire to build the to rebuild the Temple and were able to do some things and we know that the the work was hindered after they started we know that the uh we know from the from the story we know that the Samaritans you know which were a mixed group they wanted to come in and they wanted to help them build rebuild the Temple but you know um zerubabel and them uh the different ones the elders believe that no it it's for us to build the Jews were to build rebuild the Temple because that was what God had given given them and that was their work to do not anybody else's and not and not to have a mixed multitude but to have those that were fully Jews that were fully Believers to rebuild the Temple that was their work to bring that back and we know that you know they had a a lot of they had a lot of hindrance to go and we know through the scripture and studying the 70 weeks of Daniel we understand how how difficult it was for them to to rebuild and and the prophecy was given to them how they would have to hold a sword and and trial and they would have to work and look over their shoulders to watch because they always had to keep an eye on the enemy all the time as they were trying to rebuild this thing and it was a struggle for them to rebuild that Temple but they rebuilt that Temple and you know as as they were building it and they had a lot of problems and we were reading here in in Hagi when he talks about when when they had so much trouble but when Darius became king then things opened up some more and Darius helped them with with some things and everything and that they had to keep trying to uh energize the people to get to behind the work to do what God had given them to do because we know that God sent two prophets from the from this reading we know that Hagi came and Zachariah was the other one that was really the spearhead behind stirring up the people to come back into building the Temple and this is what haggi was speaking of when he's writing the when he's writing this to zerubba and Joshua is because when he sees that the people the condition that the people are in and he begins to speak there and he says the Lord says that the people say that it's not time to build the house he said the people say that it's not time but but God is standing there and he's looking and he's saying but you're living in in your nice house you're living in in a walled house and he said but the house of God what lays in Ruins and then as you see that you're you're building up things to yourself but you don't see the condition that the house of God is in and then you say but now is not the time to do that and he says then the word of the Lord came to Hagi to the to the Israel to speak unto them and tell them he said is it now time he said can you can you say that it's not time when you see the utter ruin of the house of God but the house that you live in is all full of comfort you have all these Comforts to yourselves but you've not spent one dime you've not spent one moment trying to rebuild the house of God when God told you that you were supposed to go back and you know even in the in the chapter chapter two of Hagi you know he brings it back to the people and he said who saw the former glory of the house who was the one that saw the first temple and he said remember he said but the word of the Lord come that the second temple would be greater than the first temple the glory of the second one would be greater than the first and you know he kept putting the vision before the people that it's time to rebuild the the house of God and as as Peter tells us we are a spiritual house to be build up to offer spiritual sacrifices unto God and we see how Hagi was there trying to stir up the people to get into the work of God because this is the place where God's going to meet you this is what God wants this is what God requires but he tells them said listen he said y'all have have received all these things and he said but you've not taken any time you've not put anything into the work of God you've not done anything to help the work of God and he said you have you have labored but it's not come anything he said you work and all these other things that that he talks about here he said everything that you've put your hands to is because of what you've done then when then he says consider your ways why because you've sown and it's all into the things that fill your pocket that that that are your that are really just to your own lust to your own desire he said but you've not put anything into the house of God and he stands there and he says consider your ways and he said look he said because all that you you've had and all that you've done and everything has went wrong in your way he said listen that's the reason that you're standing in and sitting in the midst of a drought right now is because you failed to be at the house of God because you failed to prepare and go forward with the house of God and you know the thing is is you and I are spiritual are a spiritual house for God we are we are God's dwelling place and if and and not just not just meeting here but it's where you meet God every single day of your life what have you put aside to to meet God and and for God to meet you to have communion and so when when he begins to speak of and he talks about everything that they have had their hands to has failed he said he said you desire he said you're trying to eat and you it never comes to not he said you try to drink and you're not and you're never ever satisfied you're never you never you just continually be thirsty he said you're always cold there's everything wrong why because you have failed me right why because if you want anything from God then you give God what you have why because if you want God to bless you then you've got to follow What God Says and he said they have gotten to a point where it was just such a terrible condition that they had gotten into that you see that how how terrible everything was around them and yet God was trying to call them back to the work of God to trying to call them back to build this is the time to build the house of God and brothers and sisters I I I want to say something tonight uh I'm going to be a mess tonight but that's all right I'm GNA preach anyway but let me tell you something after the messages that the last few messages that we've heard to across this pull pit I I tell you it it it it there reason we have to take a more Earnest heed to what we've heard and not just allow things to just to be just to be common or everyday kind of things but we've got to have a stirring to change us and who we and change Who We Are and not just allow it to be another service where we've just come and just heard the word of God and say well brother that was good and then we don't ever change why because what has been preached to us is a is a lifechanging message and and the thing is if it's not changing you then you we need to go back because we've missed what has happened and I and I tell you we it it has it something has stirred me why because I have failed God and and and and and it may just preach on me tonight and that's okay because I need it because you know what I don't want I don't want to be the same Aaron Roberts that come in here tonight I don't want to be the same Aaron Roberts that was here a year ago and from a year from now I don't want to be the same Aaron Roberts if I'm the same one that that was a year from now and there's no been no change then you know what then I Lord do something with me because I don't need to be this the biggest problem that I have is Aaron Roberts it's the one I wake up and look in the mirror at every day yeah and you know there's times that you know things are said and you know that brother brandham had had problems with things that that people that because you've got to preach the word the the the five Ministry has to preach the word you're giving you're just just like all of the prophets the different ones everybody's been given a a Ministry and they've been given a part to do and and you know what it's not always fun it's not always pleasant but it's what God has given you to do and when and brother brandom speaking in the in the message he that is in you I was I was listening to it today and you know brother brand is is speaking because the message that he preaches right before this and I don't it's not up there but uh one of the the message that brother Brandon preaches right before this is Souls that are in prison now and he begins to preach and and you talking about the condition that the world is in the church is in and how everything is in right now and he's like really because when you start to see as as brother Brown was talking about when you see that that that foolish virgin is coming for allil he said realize he said it's already over with when the foolish virgin they're coming to the to the wise with with the old he said realize he said it's all over with because there's no oil for them to receive the oil has been cut off there is no going back because when when it comes to the point when they've heard the voice said behold the bridegroom cometh when that voice went forth and to those people when they turned it down they're in inner outer Darkness there's no way to come back but only those that have the oil are able to go because they were able to raise up and trim their lamps and go in and that's the only ones that are going in nobody else is going in and when he when he gets into this point and and you know he brother Brown you know he's he's dealing with this struggle because he calls a brother's name and I think brother W mentioned that and and he's talking about you know he calls this brother's name and and you know when uh he you know he was so upset but you know brother Brandon when he when he's speaking here in this message you know he said he said you know he said it it's hard to imagine what's on a man's heart because you know you're you're trying to do the best that you can but he said you know I realize some people are going to take the wrong slant to this he said they're not going to accept it the right way because a lot of people turned brother brandham down but it wasn't what brother brandham was saying because he had it from a from what he said he said it was from a heart of love because he was saying what God had given him to say so he was only saying what thus sayth the Lord he wasn't trying to he said I know my my friends are going to turn away from me he said he knew it was going to break churches and all kinds of things all the all the the problems that they was going to create but you know what he had something that was down inside of him that was burning inside of him you know he said he talked about he carried that burden with him you know he said I would go to the mountains and pray and he said I couldn't get rid of that burden he said I'd go to the seaside and pray and I couldn't get rid of that burden there was something why because there was something something that God wanted him to do and he said he kept battling with that burden but when he began to preach that message then he realized you know that burden lifted off of him and it was something that why because it was something that God wanted him to express and it was so hard right and brother R says he said how can you say it without hurting how can you say these things without hurting people's feelings how can you how he said how can you and and it not take effect because you know when you say these things he because he says how can I say it to show the people that I'm not picking on them that you love them how can you be strict and firm and yet be loving he said oh how you're going to present it and then woe unto me if I don't present it see and there you are see no wonder it keeps you nervous and tore up so when brother bram's trying to trying to express something to the people he's not trying he's only doing what God wants him to do but he's showing it from a a way of love that he's showing what the position the condition the world's in this is what's going on this is what we got to do and it's just like he said when you SE those people when the when they're coming to the falls and and there somebody's in a little johnboat or whatever and realizing they're not going to they're not going to survive the Rapids they're not going to survive and all you can do is stand out there and yell at them it's not it's not because you're mad at them you're not trying to pick on them he said but it's from a Heart of Love you're trying to tell people the condition where you're at and listen you don't realize what danger you're in you're not going to survive you're not going to make it and and so when you when you come to that see that then it becomes a very difficult position to be in because you've got to preach the word but you realize people are not going to accept it the way you preach it and then because people when when who who was it uh was it Jeremiah that said you know because he he had he said well you know I'm just not going to speak the word of the Lord anymore why because everybody turned him down the more he preached the more more oppos opposition that he had the more problems that he had and then he finally just said listen I'm not going to speak in the name of the Lord anymore he said I'm just tired of speaking but he said then the word the Lord came to him and he said it was like fire shut up in his bones why because it was something that he had to say and you know sometimes sometimes we get to the point where you know we think well somebody's just picking on me or whatever maybe it's not maybe it's the Lord speaking to you and he's trying to get your attention but the problem is that sometimes as as we'll L read later on sometimes our our problem is our stubbornness is our problem is and that's what gets us in trouble because we get hardened by things and we get offended by things and that stops the move of God that's what stops the move of God in our life is because we've gotten offended and and sometimes we like to get behind that and we just like to hide behind that little little pet feeling or whatever our little complex and it holds up the work of God it hurt it hurts the family it hurts the church and we don't realize how much danger we are when we have that happen and we don't do anything about it now this is this is from the message the blushing prophet and it says listen it says it ought to be the happiest time in the world to the Christian for the Christian times are going to change the old's going to become young oh my death's going to flee away sickness will be no more no more prayer meetings for the sick no more prayer meetings for the lost but God shall come and take the elect from the Four Winds of the earth and Shall Gather them under his own wings and we'll live and reign with him forever in his Heaven oh brothers sisters friend of mine if you're not prepared tonight may you be prepared at that at this hour I give you an invitation to come to Christ Jesus tonight and receive you that's been different you that know that you're not where you should be with God I invite you to the altar with myself I invite everyone of you to come here and not only to say but to stay here until God has cleansed your soul from everything that's unlike him until you can go out of here a new person not with a corn plaster on but go out of here with a blood transfusion that purifies your blood and gives you new life and New Hope go out of here with the baptism of the Holy Ghost go out not shouting not dancing not so much them things are all right but they all belong in the church they are they belong in the Bible they all belong in the Bible but what I'm talking what I'm talking about is the Holy Ghost God's love now brother R continues on here and he talks about this young man that came to him and and he said his his mom had a desire to have a have a closer walk with God he said I made man young young man is talking the other day they said oh honey to her boy come here I want you to look I have oil in my hands well I have to it's here I've been sweating now he said I've I've got oil so she's talking about I've got oil in my hand said what do you think of that and the boy looked at his mother and said mother I want to ask you something she just wanted him to pray wanted him to pray that she'd have a closer walk with God he said when it all come in your hand did it take away all your condemnation did it give you a sweet experience with god well no then I'd leave it alone that's it over the world the religious world the Pentecostal people are all looking for Fantastics the world the educated so-called World denominational world is looking for some great solution that they can embed their denomination and get more members a million more and 40 4 and he continues on about the Nations and everything of the Pentecost he said but it comes by a surrendered life to Jesus Christ through the baptism of the Holy Ghost anything short of that it's wrong now I just you know because it really struck me when I read that because you know it is it is supposed to be the happiest time in the world for us and let me tell you something brothers sisters this is the great and terrible day of the Lord and we we ought to be happy and we are blessed above all measure but let me tell you something brothers sisters if you're not there if you've not if you're if this is not if you've not as as he was talking to that that son was talking to his mom if you've not had that sweet experience if you've not had a life-changing experience with God then he said you need to come now and come to the altar you know don't need to wait and don't don't second guess yourself because you know what if something is hindering you if something holds you back whatever it is you know because as brother Dale's always said I'd rather seek God every day of my life and know that I've had it the whole time this than try to guess whether I had it and play around with God and realize I didn't have it and all of a sudden one day I realize I'm on the wrong side because you know what it's a late hour and we can't play with church anymore you can't play with God you don't play with his word it's time to change it's it so we've been called to that it's a time that we need to understand what needs to what needs to take place because not just not just having a an idea or or reading books or coming to church or all that kind of stuff but you've got to know that you got to know that you got to know you've got to have a a state driven down and where where all the storms of all the hell all the devils in hell can't shake you from it you know where you're standing you know what God has done for you you know that you're uh Temple of the Living God that's right he said I would he said if it if it didn't bring you to that why because it it's so it's so easy to fall into a trap where where people have had some kind of emotional experience where where something is taking place in their life and then then they think this this is it and they drive it down and all of a sudden the next time you you see them they they're out back in the world or they they they falling back into the same traps they're s back into the same thing that they were that they came out of and they're they never can get victory over it why because they're going right back to it why because they've not reached the place that they need to that they have not stayed as brother said you got to stay there until something changes until God until you know that God speaks to you that God has has done something in your life that he has filled you with the Holy Ghost that he's changed your life but many people they've not gotten to that point this is from the message the Queen of Sheba Brother s says you know Faith cometh by hearing talking about it and and I want you to listen to some of these he said we don't do enough talking this is number number two so we don't do enough talking about the good things of God tonight the Church of the Living God is is took up too much on talking about television programs some kind of a ball game or something on that order he said we we should be testifying to the power of the resurrection of Jesus Christ and let your whole life be wrapped up in that because that many times people you know they they get so wrapped up in so many other things outside of the word of God outside of the the gospel that when they when you try to talk to people they don't know anything we we we've gotten so LAX that we spend more time and it's and it's okay to have entertainment it's it's all right to have enjoyment and all those type things but the problem is is we we find people that that claim to claim to follow the message and and and FL claim to be a Christian and claim to be a believer but you know what they they have they have better uh they have better attendance at a ball game or at Walmart or at work than they do in the house of God now brother Brenham said one time he said it was all right to miss work but he said don't miss the house of God but you know there's a lot of people you know they they they they like that little gold star or whatever they get at work you know their little bonus or whatever they get to pat on the back they got perfect attendance whatever they whatever you get for having perfect attendance at work but I tell you what you know this this is a whole lot more important than than being perfect and having perfect attendance at at some at a work at a job because your job's not going to last forever some people they sweat and toll and they do everything they can and they as as they say people are company people you know they do anything in the world for the company but the the problem is is the company don't give you anything in return you know the thing is is you know you can you can give everything that you have and pour your heart and soul into a job and the problem is is the first time they change management you're on the street before you can blink your eyes they don't care you can do everything you can to help people out and the next time you know there's all of a sudden you're pulling four or five knives out of your back you don't get you don't get no respect but people but people are so wrapped up in and working a job now we got to we got to work to live and all this kind of stuff but you know what it's not it's not the greatest thing in the world working a job ain't going to put you in going to put you in the Rapture it ain't going to get you anywhere all this stuff's going to pass away this is from the from the message second hand rad brother Ram says he's talking about his his mom he says and now here's it may hurt just a little bit but my mother used to give me when we was poor said we used to eat cornbread with grease and meat skins and everything you know she said and every Saturday night I know we used to have to take a dose of casserole he said I can't stand it today but Mom used to say I'd hold my notse said Mama it makes me so sitick I can't even bear it she said if it don't make you sick it don't do you any good so maybe that is with preaching the gospel if it doesn't stir you up a little bit and I'm afraid today that many of us that are claiming great things of God are only carnal impersonations someone else the way they act they act in the way they do and you try to put the same thing on yourself and act that way when Christianity is not a mimic it's a life Christianity comes by a birth that when you're born again of the spirit of God and become a new creature in Christ Jesus old things are passed away and All Things become new watch so when he's speaking of these things you know why because there there when the word of God why because people get so wrapped up in all these other things that are around us but the problem is is sometimes the word of God has to come and and correct the situation and be stirred up by it because sometimes you you wonder why wonder what people where people are and what's happened to people and why the condition that they're in about the about the joke that and you know I know that's not a place to joke but it you know illustrates the point but they was talking about the people that sat in the church for so long that when the move of God come come by they just sat there had sat there in the church for so long when the move of God took place all of a sudden they had a dust storm in the church because all the dust had Shettles was shaking off the people because they had sat in the church for so long they had dust settled on them that's right why because they had never had a move of God why because they just sat there and well we just come in and we just sit down and we we just do we just do our little uh religious ordinance and then we leave but they don't know how but they've not had a move of God and then you know God God can be moving all around them and they they don't have no idea what's going on they come in and they walk out the same way and when when the when the the brothers have called for for people to come up and you know when like when brother Ronnie and different ones are here and when they come and you know the Lord's moving and you know what people just like well they're still they're still sitting there that's right brother come on well what see God God can't God can only move he can only call you've got to respond if you don't respond God can't do anything else right but are you building up a house of God a house where God can dwell a go a house that God is pleased in a house that God can be glorified in this is from the message a deceived Church by the world brother says for God can keep anyone and use anyone that he that will follow after him for it's God's business but when we turn aside we turn aside away from the things of God then God cannot use us any longer when we'll walk steadfastly after the Commandments of God then we'll stay in the pages when we stay in the pages of the Bible and worship by the written word worship him in the spirit and in truth of the word then God can use an in any individual but when they take a notion to turn aside from after something else then God cannot use that person any longer so when when God has a has a desire to be to use because you know what when God calls an individual into into this Army as as brother Wade keeps telling us you know we're not on we're not on a cruise ship we're in a battleship you know God didn't call us on no Club Med vacation this is a this is Battle this is Warfare and you know there's there's one thing that that I want to say tonight when when you see the condition that things are in you know brother Donnie and the different ones that that have served in the military you know when you go in the military you don't go in there to uh just just to stare at the walls that you've got a job to do and you know brother Bown said every believer's got a job we've got a part to play we've got something to do you go you go find anybody that's been in the in the Army when you are the military the Marines whatever youve got a job to do they train you to do something amen the first thing the first thing that that when you go into places like the Marines the first thing the Marines teach you is how to that you know they want you to realize that you are a fighting machine right you are a man of war right amen you are a killing machine that's your first job first thing you got to understand when you come in here it's no longer I or me it's it's you as a group you work together because there ain't no there ain't no there ain't no freelance going on there ain't no long Rangers everybody's working together and we all got a common goal they get rid of all that other stuff because you got to learn how to walk in step with everybody else you've got a job to do and the first thing you got to do is realize the first thing you got to do is understand that you're a you're a person of War you're a soldier you're a warrior not a warrior you're a warrior that's right we fight we don't worry God didn't never gave us a spirit of fear he didn't give us a spirit of confusion he didn't give us a spirit of worry that's it on he gave us a spirit to fight that's to believe the word and fight now when he gives us that when we become a soldier in the army of God then the first thing he does is he teaches us how to battle and the first thing you do is you realize you do everything the way the Marine Corps taught you you go to bed when they tell you to and you go to bed the way they teach you to do it you get up the way they teach you to do it everything has to be done their way why because it's imprinted in your mind so when everything that you do has a reputation a rep repetition everything has a way of doing it so when you don't have to think about what you have to do when you're called upon you just act so what did Jesus tell he said in that day he said he said take no thought what you'll say why because the Holy Ghost will give you the words to say so how do you get the words to say well he just going to drop no you need to be in the word you've got to sew the word in so when you learn how to be a soldier then you've got another job you've got to learn how to do a lot of a lot of Marines you know they are they are combat infantrymen they know how to they know how to get off of a ship swim they had a beat headed and they're going to take it over and they lock it down that's right amen and that's their job and it doesn't matter some people some of them they go in there and they can they can shoot a gun and they can dig a hole and all those type things but their other job is everything else and some people they're plumbers there's people that are Cooks some are medics whatever your job is but there's another job so you don't you just don't sit around and look at the walls come on there's something that you have to do I was thinking about a man that years ago that that he served he wanted to join during Vietnam he said well I'm I'm gonna get in I'm gonna join and and get ahead so I don't have I don't have to go to Vietnam he said I'm gonna go in I'm gonna get in I'm gonna get in a a branch of service I'm going to stay out of of all of that I'm going to try to find something that's safe to do and so he went to the Navy he thought hey the Navy's a a good easy job it's safe I can I can I can handle this for a few years I'll be okay so he went in he was looking at the list he said I saw the thing where it said cook he said hey I think I can do that I think i' be pretty safe had a recruiter come by and say hey man you don't want to be no cook he said I got a great job for you he said well I'm listening he said I want you to be a hospital Corman he said what's a hospital Corman he said well it's a really neat job you get to hang out with all these pretty nurses in the hospital and then you get to pass out drugs and help a little bit in the hospital and you help these people he said hey I think can handle that so he signed up to be a hospital Corman well he got into his training he got through that they shipped him off to Corman School guess what he found out there ain't no such thing as that in the Navy a hospital Corman or a Navy Corman is a Navy medic and if you want to know where the Navy Medics end up they get attached to Marine Corps units so he said spent three and A2 years in the Navy attached to Marine Corps units and he said the first thing I got done was got shipped to Vietnam and he said I was the one that was over there bandaging up these guys that had been shot up and blown up and everything else and trying to patch them up he said the person the place that I didn't want to end up is where I ended up so not you know everybody just don't have some cushy job but there's a job that you've got to do right and so when when God has called you to a place God just gives us a job to do and whether whether it's preaching the gospel playing an instrument being a deacon or or cleaning the church or whatever it is or just coming to church and shining the light and saying Amen to the gospel then that's our that's what your job is whatever your job is then that's what your that's what your job is because it's we come here and we and we meet together and we recharge our p batteries and you know we praise the Lord and we get we get energized and we make it through to the next service and you know we just Feast on the good things of God but you know when you walk out that door you've got to be ready you've got to be ready to battle God didn't call us to this to be losers God didn't call us to be to be failures right well if God if God called me to to this place and you know what then he then if he's already he done it that I don't have to worry about whether he's going to do it or not why because if if I have been sealed by the Holy Ghost until the day of my Redemption then then tell me what day is that going to be what time is there going to be that I'm not going to be ready that I don't have the blessings of God now I don't have to accept them just as we was preaching on last time I don't have to go to court that's right I can have the rights to go to court and have a judgment against the devil and have him kicked out but if I don't exercise the rights then it's not anything for me I don't get any benefit of it if God if he's if he's if he took all those stripes upon his back for my healing and then I go and and cry out to God and will you heal me right can you imagine that it's it's so amazing it's just like somebody running by holding out holding out a w a $100 bills trying to get them to you like I I don't I don't know about that well if somebody pulled out if terce pulled out aund bunch of $100 bills and had them we know that won't happen but it' be a miracle but anyway God works miracles but anyway you know if somebody if somebody had that you know then well I I I don't know about that but you know God God's not that way so you so you don't trust what God said come on Brother come on you won't trust what God said well it's like well you know God healed me two or three years ago but I don't know about today and then you come to church and we say well we we got a praise report this one's been healed and that one's been healed and this one's been healed and that one's been healed and God moved in this situation he done all these great things and then we sit there well I wonder if he'll do it for me yeah come on come on brother and it's like well the the Bible says that that you know if I if I would just trust him and and and I would just try him he said he'd open up the windows of heaven and pour out a blessing I couldn't contain but I don't know I don't know if that's true or not come on if you if if God said it then then why is it that we won't we won't believe it and people say well you know I get in here brother Wade and I get to looking at this stuff and you know sometimes my eyes cross I I I get to reading this stuff and I'm so confused on all this stuff and I begin to read these things and and and it looks like one way and it looks like I I can't figure it out and I you know well we don't try to figure it out but you know what I've got a promise in the Bible where he where brother brandham said he he because he said the the spirit of Truth he said how be when he the spirit of Truth is going be to lead you and guide you into all truth that's right it ain't going to be a mystery that's right it's going to be a revelation and brother Bram said a real true Eagle will understand well then you know what if I'm a real true eagle and he's opened this up to me then guess what then I can understand it he said he said this the Bible this message can be understood by the most illiterate than well praise God I'm not there but you know I might be at the bottom somewhere but I may not be that but at least he put me in that in that class you know you know we we see people sometimes and and you you you wonder about people and you know because we allow the devil to talk to us and get into our minds and you know some sometimes it's nice to understand because you know you have you have an understanding God God's able to touch you and he's able to speak to you and praise God we we we all can read and write you know we got through you know High School most of us we got through past the third grade or seventh grade or whatever it was you know I think sometimes when you know I can read I can I can listen I can understand all these things I can look up words and all this kind of stuff and I think about brother jel fory he couldn't even read couldn't read at all couldn't didn't know nothing and the Lord come down and supernaturally touched him where he could start reading that he could able to study the Bible and read the Bible and study the message well guess what y'all was that far gone y'all were above that and he worked the supernatural miracle in brother jules's life that he could do that well you know what y'all don't have that we didn't have that problem well then then if if God was able he was mindful of somebody that had faith that put his confidence in God that he could do that for him well you know what we we should be able to get above that well I don't I I don't know well you know what you never you never will until you actually come to the place where you actually realize you know what I'm not going to listen to what the devil has to say I'm going to put my faith in What God [Applause] Says so when we read the scripture then and we pray about it when we read what God says and we pray about it then we realize have the Holy Ghost well I'm just going to hold this right I don't understand this but I know that the Holy Ghost will come amen God God is O Brother R said that if you had a question that he's obligated to put somebody behind the pull pit that can answer your question and sometimes it's it's amazing because you you're I I I've got a little iPod beside the bed I listen to brother brandom at night and it and it's pretty amazing because I woke up in the middle of the night 3:00 in the morning I hear Brother brandham start preaching brother Bram says stuff and all of a sudden it's like catches my attention well I pull out my phone because I've got the message on my phone I start looking up the quote because I start reading what brother brandom said because sometimes I hear I think did he actually say that because it catches your attention and it's like well the Lord's speaking to you and it's like wow that's amazing all of a sudden you back and you start reading and it's like hey I got to hold on to that one cuz that was a good nugget that donees something for me and it's just like he speaks to you well you know that's the whole thing is when you listen or you read then sometimes you you've read you've read the same thing over and over and over amen and it ain't done anything for you you know it may be the fifth time the 500th time you read it and all of a sudden all of a sudden it just opens up and you see everything in a brand new because know when you come to to the place you read the scripture and and it's just like well that doesn't mean any it just I I'm lost confused well you know you just stay in the word and wait till it opens you know I I I've had scriptures that I've seen that that looks that look so contrary or look so so confusing and all of a sudden the next time you read them after the Lord opens them up to you you will never ever read them the same way you did before as brother R talked about he said you know he said I packed a Baptist Bible he said I read them with Baptist glasses and he said all that but he said when the Holy Spirit came and he opened up the word then it became a new book to him then he could never saw it the same way he saw it before then you don't ever have to see it the same way that you saw it before you can never see it the same way now this is from the message hear ye him brother BR says Jesus never gathers his people just to be gathering he said Christ never did anything Loosely and I think that's the problem with the church today we take too many things of God Loosely and now I perceive that this is a Pentecostal Gathering listen if you're my brothers and sisters but the Pentecostal people are too Loosely with the gifts that's in the church and that's the reason God can't respect them see you just get them let them go any old way they shouldn't be they should be governed and put in order and then he continues on talking about people speaking in tongues and meetings and everything and he says and so you understand he said then it's confusion how they're working but he says the gift he said the prophets the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophet he said so he said so we we so misuse these things just letting it go freelance that's just as good as the devil would want it to right well that's just because if if you get it out of if you get it out of order that's just as bad as not using it at all because you exactly You' just conf created all this confusion he said that's right he said them gifts had been set in order and put in place that that have that had been a Revival sweep this land today that's never been exceeded he said we don't lack power we lack knowledge we lack Faith you got power any man that's born again has the whole Heavens the whole Heavens is open to him so the problem is we don't have we don't lack power he said we lack faith and we lack knowledge and what struck me about that is see when you have all these gifts God has given you a gift so if God's called you into this place of being in a battle being in an army then God is giving you a gift everybody has a gift to use whatever your gift is the they you need to find out what your gift is amen and and some people's problem is is they don't know what their gift is and they never try to seek an answer to come to a place where God shows them what their what their gift is so they don't know how to operate they don't know what they can do to help people why because they've never sat down and stalk God about it and so there's a gift of God that's in the body that's not being used right brother amen and then if we and if we misuse our gifts and we don't operate them the right in the correct manner then we realize he said that's worse than you know that's just that's a good as the devil wants you to do because then it all creates all this confusion right amen he said but we don't lack power he said we lack knowledge so you got to have faith to come up that stature of a perfect man to come to a place where you get knowledge because there is knowledge in the Holy Ghost but You' got to come to this place where you have knowledge where it's sealed in but if we want but if we want to be used of God then that's what we've got to do we've got power but we've got to be able to use it and God has and God has more power he has more gifts that he wants you to do he has things he wants you to do but the problem is you've got to come to the place where he can use you we've got to come to that place where we're able to be utilized of God to be the living instrumentality of Jesus Christ to be able to be used in the way that God wants us to be used not just to be holding back right you know it's just like people collect things and you know you know I worked with a guy one time and and you know he he he was a he was a good guy he was smart but you know the company bought him tools and you know he just wanted he just wanted to see how long he can keep all these tools in the plastic he's like he's like well you know he said I I what I want what I want to do is I want to turn them back in when I quit in the same condition I got them in well you ought to quit now then but that's that that's but that's people's mentality amen you know it's just like collecting a bunch of of porcelain whatnots and all kinds of stuff knickknacks and all that kind of stuff got to build up these nice little shelves put all this stuff on what you what does it do collect dust and that's I mean that's okay that's okay but what I'm saying is is you know that God God don't give us gifts to hang them on the shelf for us to look at God don't don't don't give us and you use because we're given things to be used to be used of God but also to utilize the things that we have because if God calls us to live in a place of heavenly places then then guess what then we live in Heavenly places and we utilize the things that are there right amen but if we don't then you know what it doesn't do anybody any good n it's just like people that that that can sing and you know it some people they can sing but you know what it it's like pulling teeth trying to get people to sing but you know you know the people that that are that are happy to get up and sing you know what I'm talking about and I ain't calling any names but some folks couldn't carry a tune in a bucket but you know what the Bible says to make a Joyful Noise yeah and you know what some people don't like like pops always said he said we're going to make we're going to be somewhere between a Joyful Noise and an awful racket but you know what some people they don't mind doing that but some people they can sing like a night Andale and you'd have you'd have to put Dynamite under them blow it up for them to actually get them to move to to sing for the Lord that's right you know I've told I've told so many young people that that I've talked to that that see that like our young people and the ones that don't want that have these wonderful gifts and everything like that I said they get up here and they say well I I make I make a mistake somebody listen there's 88 keys on that piano right right so there's 88 keys on that piano right there she she guesses she plays the piano she don't anyway right somebody somebody somewhere along that number I don't know what it is somebody knows I don't but I think that's how many okay you know I mean you know how many how many keys do you how many those things you hit at time sister Esther 10 11 9 4 6 whatever it is that you're hitting right out of 88 and somebody's hitting all of a sudden well I hit the wrong one how many people know that there was a wrong key hit and if you mess up just do like sister Esther does I don't fix everything I love that maybe nobody else in this church does but I I we List It we let I Sarah and I we were we're in the car and coming on Wednesday night we hear her playing the piano sometimes and man she just going and I hear her rake at that piano man I tell him I say I tell him I said sister Esther's playing the piano I like if I don't do something for you I think your spoons fell out you Bo so just do it in for me if nobody else likes it sister es I like it but let me tell you what it does something for me but but I tell them I said listen I said you get up here and there's 88 keys and and how many how many string you got 10 strings on the on the mandolin right yeah okay listen there's six strings on the guitar I know that much I play that I don't know what everybody else knows but anyway somebody somebody will know there's four there's four on the violin I know that much but you know I mean how many key I mean how many notes you you're playing a song you how how many in in a song how many you hit 200 200 notes come on whatever and yeah how many people in here have a perfect pitch and and understand hey you hit the wrong note I wouldn't but some people you know they'll they'll play a song they'll get up here and play a song and they'll play and they play for four minutes they'll play a song for four minutes and the only thing that they get out of that four minutes is I hit the wrong note they don't get into the spirit of worship they get out of that one note and I tell kids I say listen you're you're not playing for the audience this is not a concert I said when you get up here and play you're playing for God you don't worry about whether whether you hit the wrong note or nothing then you learn you know what because a lot of y'all don't know how many mistakes I've made playing the guitar because most of you don't know how to play the guitar so you wouldn't know if I made it or not Richard sometimes knows when I make a mistake but nobody else does yeah but you know what it's playing for the glory of the Lord It's not trying to worry about whether whether we are and and it's good to practice but you know when you get in the in the in the church it's a spirit of worship it's not worryed about trying to get every single note right and that's good but when you come to the house of God what are you trying to do are you trying to glorify God because a lots of times people will get and they get into this into this thing and and you you'll see them they'll get up here it's like you know what if you were in in your house if you were sitting in your house at the piano and you started to play the piano you've got zero pressure on you and you began to play the songs and all of a sudden you'll feel the presence of the Lord come and you and you'll begin to enter into a spirit of worship in your own house and the only person that's there is you and the Lord and I said you know what that's the same idea when you come to the house of God when you sit down to play it's not just to be going through the motions but it's to bring a spirit to worship and then when you realize I'm glorifying God that's what God wants to see and I always tell young people listen don't when you get up here just play for the glory of God because God's the only one that matters pray because you know everything that we ought to do is to be pleasing unto the Lord not just not just trying to do things because you know we're trying to impress somebody that doesn't do any good that's right so when you come up here play play for the glory of the Lord sing for the glory of the Lord raise your hands and if you can't if you can't hold up one you know both hands just hold up one for a while then swap to the other one brother and if your hands get tired just go like this when when know you're tired but it's okay raise your hand if you just swing your arm you put it back down right it's it's better than just sitting there looking like this and I understand some people come in and and boy I tell you what them them them pews they'll move on you they because they're holding them down all the [Laughter] time but you know when we come to the house of God you know I see I see people you know what they'll get out and they they can work I got I got guys that I work with friends and I tell you what they can get out and they can work in the yard they can I mean sweat just all kind of work but you know what they they can't don't sit them down they're useless and you and it's like it's so amazing when you when you when you work I mean you can do but you can't come to the house of God you can't raise your hand you can't clap your hands let's let's pull them engines apart and do all kinds of stuff but you know we come we all we ought to put we ought to put a little bit of emphasis on what we're doing when we get [Applause] here but sometimes you know we don't realize when we come here we just well we're we're just back in and doing the same thing no we're meeting with we're meeting with God he gave us he gave us his all he gave us our his best then we ought to give us give him our best we ought to give him our all that we have now brother BR was speaking here in the in the message the leading of the spirit and he was speaking of the of the Magis and he says he said and they watched the stars in every city and not one of them ever saw it speaking to all the cities that when he was when they were going everybody between there and Bethlehem nobody saw that star all the way to Jerusalem when they when they came to see Herod excuse me when they got to see Herod nobody saw that they come all that way and the mag followed all the way from India Plum into Palestine why didn't they see it he said the reason people can't see the Glorious things of God today they're not looking for them that's the reason it's only given to those who are looking for it those Magi had W had watched balam's prophecy when he said there'll be a star rise out of Jacob they knew it and the way things were shaping up it was time for it to happen and you can tell amen he said but listen here here it is listen you can tell we're at the end of the road Atomic bonds Cobalt hydrogens the Nations it's trembling fussing the great enemy hanging Yonder with jet planes that could blow this nation to Pieces yes the whole world in five minutes time everybody's nervous well that was 1955 it's the same thing today in 2022 but what but here here those people they saw what the prophecy the Magi saw what the prophecy was and brother said how people didn't see the things of God is because they weren't looking for it but those people brother said they got up every single day and and every night they studied the stars and had wrote down everything that had happened all the changes and knew where every Star was supposed to be and what would take place and they knew by the by the writings by the prophecies what was going to take place so every time they got up there were looking they were looking to see what was anomaly what was something different when they saw that take place and they saw that star rise up out of Jacob then they knew that was a prophecy to be fulfilled and they started heading that way because it caused a reaction because it moved them because they saw something well the same way if if you had SE something that it doesn't it doesn't move you then you really didn't see something it didn't change you because if if you see actually see something that it's a life-changing experience then you've got to move but people don't see those things brother BR speaking he's speaking here in in the message the uncertain uh I'm sorry be certain of God and and he was speaking of Ahab and he was talking about the condition that the world had gotten into and right right before here brother brand was speaking he's speaking of of coming to God and and and leaving God and and realizing where you've come to and where you where you are today and brother R speaking and he starts talking about the chaplain that come to the soldier and he asked the soldier when he was sitting there and he was laying dying on the ground and the chaplain come to him and he said son he said where where did you leave God he began to talk to him about it and he kept looking back he said Son you don't have a lot of time he said Now's the Time to understand where you've left God he said you need to understand where have you left God where where was it and he said at that moment he said then he said he began to say now I lay me down to sleep why because he left God as a child and that's where he left God but he had to go right back to that place to find God where he left him and he said as he was laying there dying he began to pray and he said then he slipped off because he' come back to the place and he said you've got to know where you come to and he begins to talk about this the condition that we're in and he begins to talk about Ahab and he said all these things had long left Ahab why because Ahab but left God why because he got so wrapped up in his ancestral idolatry that they had got the Kings of Israel had gotten away from all of the precepts and all the laws of God that they had come to and that's exactly what Ahab done because he just walked in the in the way of his fathers now now he had done all these things and he just well I'm just doing what everybody else has done and all of a sudden he he marries Jezebel and he gets all twisted up in that and and then he he begin to talk about how Jezebel tried to put the uh come out there was twisted before J said you know she got he said after her husband was dead she dressed herself and twisted out before who thought she could Vamp the the man of God and said throw her out the window he said if we had more men like J today we'd have less Jezebels but that was her nature and she was a wor worshipper of idolatry and she thought the whole and she brought the whole nation to idolatry and so has our modern Trends today falling from falling away from the things of God and has brought the world to one of the greatest idolatries that we have that's idleness just idling Away Great is the iniquity of the people today making plenty of money and think that God's blessing us because he's prospered us that's no sign of God's blessing not at all so many people you know they get wrapped up in their own things but they they have this great Idol and it's idleness where they don't do anything now yeah that well I go to work and I come home and and and out on all these things but you know what they don't do anything for the house of God they don't do anything for a spiritual walk with God and great is this idolatry why because well you know we're just doing we're just keeping up with the Joneses and and we're doing all these other things but they're not doing anything to put anything toward having a spiritual walk with god brother and so they've they've missed out all these things because they've not continued on with what God has called them to God's speaking to them and then then this this is from the message here you him brother says he said speaking of the tutor and he speaking of the Holy Ghost he said now the tutor had to report to the father all that the child did whether it was good or bad the tutor had to give a correct report and the father seen that it was his tutor would be a little wishy-washy sort of a guy and his son would be doing wrong he'd be afraid before the father to say that his son was doing wrong he had to be the right kind of tutor a real just and honest man he looked for that type of person to put over his child and it's allog together a beautiful type of God our Father sending to us the Church the tutor the razor the Holy Spirit God found the best tutor that there was in heaven to put over his church the Holy Spirit not some intellectual being that's just got a lot of Education more than they got a lot of Education to know how to control it and the church was not to be raised on intellectuals not but it was to be tutored not by denomination but it was to be tutored by the Holy Spirit that's God's tutor and what do you think that the tutor would do to come before the father and have to tell him how his children was progressing I sometimes wonder how the Holy Spirit must feel to go in the presence of God with the character of his children today who we who call ourselves Sons and Daughters of God how he must like the prophet of gold blush in the presence of God how the church has become so indignant about the things of God how they go off on little tantrums and don't even notice the word of God remember the Holy Spirit Will tune to the children by the direction of the book of the father that's the word God will raise his church by the word and the Holy Spirit will teach the church the word not the catechism not the rules of the church but the power of the word of the Living God the holy spirit will give that to the church did not our blessed Lord say man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out the mouth of God that's the thing the holy spirit will teach and when the Holy Spirit teaches unadulterated Holiness before the Lord how do you think the Holy Spirit feels to bring the word before the father that were selfish that were unconcerned we'll stay home on prayer meeting nights to watch the old religious programs uncensored with dirty jokes and everything and then calling ourselves the Church of the Living God what do you think he thinks tonight amen can you imagine the Holy Ghost having to look at people's lives and understand that he has to give an account to tell the Lord what the what the people are because you know when he said when when they was a tutor when a man had a son he wanted to raise him up he gave him the best kind of tutor well he give us the the best the Holy Ghost but he came to raise us but you know what you don't have to follow the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost gives you the way to go but you know what it's up to you to following and you don't and you don't have to foll him right but you know what just remember when you decide hey I'm not going to follow the Holy Ghost I'm going to do my own thing or it's okay to do this or whatever you know we we get a little bit lacks on everything just remember you're going to pay for it there's always there's always a payment that's got to be made he said listen he said you know we're taught by the word of God to be raised by the word of God and he said how can the how can the spirit the the Holy Spirit he said when when it says that we're selfish and we're unconcerned when we're selfish why because you know the Life of Christ is not a selfish life you can't live you can't be selfish and Live the Life of Christ because when when Christ came then he you know everything he said he said I don't do anything the son can do nothing in himself except what he sees the father do that doeth the son likewise well you know that'd be kind of hard sometimes if we sat down and we started looking at the way we live our lives sometimes the way we speak to our children the way we speak to our wives the way we speak to our boss sometimes the way people the way we react the way people say things to us and say how would how's that pleasing to the Lord would the Lord do that would that be the what and then it's like you know some well I don't I don't want to I don't you know I I I just going to do do my little part no sometimes when God calls you to do more people don't want to respond to that well I don't want to get out of my comfort zone I'm I'm okay over here no God calls you and sometimes he wants you to get up and like well why am I going that way well it's just like Abraham when God called Abraham God called Abraham up and said listen I want you to leave your family he said I want to follow want you to follow me come out here go to a place that you've never been before I want to show you take you to place it's like well I don't know where I'm going well guess what you just follow me cuz I'm GNA lead you and he started out walking and all of a sudden he couldn't he couldn't even follow the the directions that God gave him to begin with because he had to take lot with him and God didn't tell him to take lot he told him to go himself you got to separate from your family and what happened it it let he went on down the road and after so long then he had had a blow up with with lot and all a sudden they had all the the herdsmen were fighting and they had to split up why because it wasn't for Abraham to be there he had to get had to separate from lot God calling him out his own way so when God calls he's got a way for us to go sometimes you know we don't understand why we have to go certain ways but that's what God has us to have faith you got to have faith in what God's doing and not realizing you know I I I used to drive I used to drive me crazy when I was when when the boys were little because you know they they play 20 questions and as soon as you get the 20 questions they got 20 more questions they want you to answer they're always questioning everything and it's like listen it's not for you to know just do what you're told right when you you all the answers when you get there we got things to do besides us standing here answering all your question questions just do what you're told right because you know what they want to have the answer before they do something but God sometimes we want we want God to give us the answer before we do something and God's trying to tell us you just need to walk by faith you just need to walk forward don't keep asking questions while well why why Lord I'm just going to put it in your hands and realize you're going to take control of it so I can just walk I'm just going to continue to walk forward because that's the best thing for me to do right Amen brother BR says he said now he said now every person thinks of their children this is from message of the way to have Fellowship he said now every person thinks of their children he said while while they're under your wings you watch them but once out from under the wings then the devil's got every little Oscar he can out there to associate with your children that's idelic I mean the develish and everything else God help us the juvenile delinquency here in New York Chicago and all these big cities watch the papers is writing up how they kill one another and everything the little children little boys and girls killing and murdering shooting and so forth like that if those poor little kitties only realize that that's the devil sure he said what brought on juvenile delinquency was parent delinquency the parent failing to take care of their children he said he continues on he says he said remember the doctor told my wife said just let that kid Squall said it ain't going to hurt him and if his grandma comes along to pick him up and take take her hands off of him he ought to be crib broke at six months he says now you know better than that sounds like a talk Talking of a witch doctor instead of a real doctor and then you know what it hatched out it hatched out a bunch of erotics and a bunch of gangsters listen God gave you that child of love I don't care how bad you SPO it love it anyhow that's right love it if you don't love it now it'll grow up in a cold home and indifferent and it'll seek love somewhere else or something it'll be out an outl for some for somewhere mother take that baby and give it fellowship and love now make it a part of you which it is act like and hug it and kiss it and love it don't be too cold with the things of The World God gave you that as a treasure raise it right amen notice that's what's the matter we got away from the things of God you get away from nature then you're out of the will of God you know you know many times because people you know they have all of these books and all these self-help books and you know it's so funny because you know people have spent millions of dollars buying books and all these people Dr Spock and all these other ones that that have written books Dr Dobson and everybody else trying to teach you how to raise your kids and you know and you know everybody's got everybody's got to write a book and put it out and then it's it's doctor this and doctor that and it's like you know and sometimes when you get down and you start studying what they got it's I mean Dr Seuss is a better is a better book than some of these doctor books and Dr Pepper is better than some of these books but I mean people people put all of their of their life into these books that this is going to help them ra children but the problem is is God give us a book on how to raise children but the problem is is people don't realize that it's a book to raise children that's right that God give us a way to raise children and he said we get away from the things of God he said then we're out of the will of God why because we don't look where God tells us to look where God has given us away to raise kids that's right and some you know and you know it's like all the time back you know it was always well you know um they they didn't want they didn't want uh mothers breastfeeding because they come up with formula and it was so much better and when they were trying to sell all this and then come to find out you know what what God made was better than what God what man made amazing how that God created something and a man tried to spend years de trying to make something trying to doctor something up to sell to people and come to find out what God done in the beginning was the best and people well that's shocking yeah yeah but that's what people done they trying to find a better way to do something and not realize that God's already made the perfect wayen God has the most perfect way and you're not going to be able to find a better way than the way God made it this is from return and Jubilee He said brother B says today we have preached preachers ethical educated fine Scholars turned out can stand up and never move never mess a hair mess up a hair NE never sweat a drop and just stand there and speak and oh give the articles of the church and everything just so pretty for 15 minutes while you're sleeping go on back home and you call yourselves Pentecostals he said brother what we need is need an old rugged Backwoods preacher that'll come with a pair of overalls on and hit the pull pit Hallelujah Anointed with the power of God he won't preach for 5 minutes till the spirit will take the

your eego oh that sounds good he said I understand that kind of talk yes sir why he was an eagle to begin with he was actually an eagle just got in the wrong Nest that was all I hope I don't hurt you Brethren I'm just telling you the truth that's right many of them today is in the wrong Nest many times we get in the wrong Nest why because we're not in the place that God wants us to be but we hear the word and God's calling us out of that where wherever you're at God's calling you up am he said oh in the wrong Nest huh mama is that what happened yeah you're my mama yes I'm both father and

ground and start flapping your wings real hard I'll get you he jumped up this little Eagle coming up coming out of them denominations and give a little FL great big flap four or five times and lit

Mommy ain't I doing good look there I am now mama she said Sunny you're going to have to jump higher than that or I can't get you right there she stooped down again she he throwed his little feet up in the air and began to flop his wings as hard as he could and the first thing you know he felt something being lifted up up up till he struck the milky white way amen then he could fly himself after he got high enough he could fly himself brother that's what the matter with the church today it's never raised up high enough just to get out of an organization it or or something another to find out whether could fly or not how do you know you can't fly use your wings amen hallelujah jump into it go to flapp in your wings and find out Jehovah will catch you I will bear You Up On Eagle's Wings

flapping your wings as hard as you can and whatever the battle is you just press on as hard as you can not just go halfway but continue to press the battle why because God is wanting us to build up a
