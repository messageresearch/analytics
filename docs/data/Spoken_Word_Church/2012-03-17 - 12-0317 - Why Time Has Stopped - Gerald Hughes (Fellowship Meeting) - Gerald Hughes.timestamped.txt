[5:15] he saw the
[5:16] city poorly given to
[5:20] idolatry and escaped
[5:22] to
[5:26] 18 then certain men certain philosophies
[5:30] of the
[5:32] epicurian and of the
[5:34] stoics encountered him and some said
[5:38] what will this bab
[5:44] say after the
[5:46] some he seem to be a settler for a
[5:51] strange Gods because he preach unto them
[5:56] Jesus and the resurrection amen amen am
[6:00] I just want the lord to bless your heart
[6:01] with a lot of scripture I've been

[6:12] not taking just just a little bit but
[6:14] just to see the up am when Paul was
[6:21] waiting now remember the bride is
[6:23] waiting yeah and Paul looked around and
[6:26] he saw that everything had been given to
[6:29] the the devil everything around him was
[6:33] bad and the bride is waiting we seeing
[6:36] everything going on around us is so
[6:41] bad come on yes
[6:44] amen the Bible say when Paul saw that
[6:48] when he saw that everything was
[6:51] holy now I'm just talking we understand
[6:54] what is going on right now everything
[6:57] the government politics
[7:00] the economies everything is wholly given
[7:03] to the devil yeah school system is given
[7:06] to the devil y so the Bible say when
[7:10] Paul saw that his Spirit was fed yes
[7:15] it's time for the bride to be stirred

[16:27] Jesus
[16:29] amen so uh quite a message we have isn't
[16:32] it right quite a turn of events we're
[16:34] watching in this world quite a pressure
[16:37] coming down on people amen and we're
[16:40] feeling the effect of that pressure
[16:41] that's why our lives are so weighed down
[16:43] at times but but don't weary and well
[16:46] doing the Holy Bible says that church
[16:48] greets you sweet water we're having a
[16:50] great Revival and good things are
[16:52] happening just watching the word come to
[16:54] pass but as a way to encourage you I
[16:58] want you to know
[16:59] Brothers you may be the only brother in
[17:02] your whole neighborhood that takes the
[17:03] place as a man is supposed to MH
[17:07] sisters if you're right with the Lord
[17:09] and raising your children up you may be
[17:11] the only one in your whole neighborhood
[17:13] right right that is raising their
[17:14] children in the fear and admonition of
[17:16] God yes children even if you go to
[17:19] school you might be the only one dressed
[17:20] right you might be the only one that
[17:22] don't cheat in your class you might be
[17:24] the only one that stands for
[17:26] righteousness brothers who are EST Lish
[17:29] you may be the only one within miles of
[17:32] where you live that knows how to explain
[17:35] that hell's not Eternal or that we're to
[17:38] be baptized in his precious name not his
[17:40] titles what a position we hold just
[17:43] because of who we are and what's been
[17:44] given unto us so don't be discouraged we
[17:48] have a great opportunity we are turning
[17:50] the world upside down and and around and
[17:53] around and everything's being shaken
[17:55] because of the doctrine of this message
[17:57] amen and I believe we're g to we headed
[17:59] for some stormy seas but I believe that
[18:02] the same God that begun the good work is
[18:05] able to finish the good work right even
[18:07] the devil and all his tactics do nothing
[18:09] but to identify who we are so if you're
[18:12] being attacked much praise God much
[18:15] because that means you have something
[18:17] that he hates his life cannot be
[18:20] received by God but yours can yes and he
[18:23] is a devil of jealousy he is a devil of
[18:26] bitterness he is a a devil that wants to
[18:29] take all his attributes and try to put
[18:31] it on us oh yeah so we wonder why are
[18:33] all those people being so nasty it's
[18:35] because they got that all over them but
[18:37] they don't have the Blessed Holy Spirit
[18:39] to take it off of them amen We Gather
[18:42] here and these meetings are wonderful
[18:44] these meetings give us strength I I
[18:45] can't stand to miss these meetings I
[18:48] can't stand to not see my brothers every
[18:50] now and then to to get together to let
[18:52] you know that I'm pushing for the word
[18:54] yet I'm believing this message more than
[18:56] I've ever believed it before I remember
[18:59] years ago over in Arkansas we we would
[19:01] visit this church this small building
[19:04] smaller than this by far and it was just
[19:06] stuffed full and I remember there's not
[19:08] a place to sit but me and my wife and
[19:11] little children would come up and
[19:12] magically a place would form right in
[19:14] the front just like I saw
[19:17] today and you know maybe some of those
[19:19] folks were so simple they thought they
[19:21] were just giving us a place to seat what
[19:23] a blessing that would be know you know
[19:25] what they're doing they're giving us the
[19:27] opening of the word yeah so when you do
[19:31] something for someone you are preaching
[19:32] to them the opening of the word that is
[19:36] the position that we hold that's why we
[19:38] hold our high standards that's why we
[19:41] press to even love our enemies and extra
[19:43] love our brothers and sisters amen
[19:46] because we are the opening of the word
[19:48] people that's right your your life
[19:50] expresses that God did come down in the
[19:52] last day to reveal the Mysteries hidden
[19:55] in those seals the Mysteries hidden over
[19:58] over there at Rome so the bad guys
[20:00] exposed and the good guys revealed I
[20:03] just love it and I just can't wait to be
[20:05] in heaven also so let's press the battle
[20:07] and good to see all of you good to see
[20:09] brother Homer sister Margie and just so
[20:12] many others brother
[20:14] Tony my the world just doesn't

[20:22] ones have a song oh and this my nephew

[26:25] this new heart in you yes then said
[26:28] he'll put a a spirit in you new spirit

[26:43] his people amen there nothing like this
[26:45] message on Amen I tell you what i' been

[27:00] ever happen and ever since then my soul
[27:03] has been hungry and thirsting Hallelujah

[37:58] you don't see like people are really
[38:01] kind of dropping away or getting
[38:03] discouraged and uh and you know had it
[38:06] on my mind and this morning was getting
[38:08] ready and sat down and i' printed off a
[38:10] little book here and was thinking about
[38:13] coming to the fellowship meeting today
[38:15] and know a lot of people's concerned
[38:16] well a lot of things going against it's
[38:19] the gas going up and a lot of things
[38:21] about being able to get here and
[38:22] different things like that and I thought
[38:25] you know people have so many different
[38:27] excuses for different things and I
[38:28] thought but you like holy spirit said
[38:31] but who made you want to get right go
[38:34] ahead so I got to thinking about that
[38:36] who made me want to go I thought maybe
[38:39] they just ain't got in contact with the
[38:40] same guy I got
[38:43] in amen so let me share this little
[38:46] thing right here where you I printed off
[38:48] a book you one good thing about the
[38:49] computer now you can print off sermons
[38:51] by Brother Brown now and I love that a
[38:54] lot of them I don't have them printed in

[38:58] wait and get ready and brother man was

[39:04] you know that's what we're lacking may
[39:05] his faith Amen brother say your faith
[39:08] got to be anchored in something you know
[39:10] I can say well I got faith in this pull
[39:12] pit but this pull pit can't help help me
[39:15] am might have faith in this piano but
[39:16] that piano can't help me I can have
[39:18] faith in these drone but they can't help
[39:19] me but you got to have something faith
[39:21] in something that can get results amen a
[39:25] lot of people their faith is in the
[39:26] doctor
[39:28] their faith is in the medication amen
[39:30] you come along with brother B said now
[39:31] that medication can't heal you it can
[39:34] only assist nature until healing can
[39:37] take place in your body I said thank the
[39:39] Lord for that amen you got to work
[39:42] according to nature but brother said
[39:43] here he said my how that Moses after
[39:46] having 40 Years of religious training by
[39:48] his mother and having 40 Years of
[39:51] military might in his hands of how to
[39:55] whip a nation and how to conquer
[39:58] and then it taken God 40 years to take
[40:00] it out of him but once out there in the
[40:03] wilderness brother Homer Al one day he
[40:07] come face to face with God in a burning
[40:11] bush that's what the difference I

[40:19] he said man when to come face to face
[40:21] with that burning bush he was better
[40:23] equipped in 5 minutes after he had

[1:27:38] heard thus far and Lord the sweet Spirit
[1:27:41] of love and fellowship that we sense
[1:27:43] here in this
[1:27:44] building oh Lord and now may you just
[1:27:48] continue to bless us father we ask this

[1:28:03] scripture and that way it won't keep you
[1:28:06] standing quite so
[1:28:07] long but um again before I
[1:28:12] actually uh forget I wanted to express
[1:28:15] my appreciation for the invitation to be
[1:28:18] here once again and um I thought it was
[1:28:21] two years ago when I was here last but
[1:28:25] um maybe it was just last year you know
[1:28:27] we lose track of time after a while yeah
[1:28:31] but um I really appreciate uh I deem it
[1:28:34] a very special privilege to be here and
[1:28:38] so
[1:28:39] um you know one of the greatest things
[1:28:43] brother Homer that a man can give to
[1:28:45] another man is his
[1:28:48] Pulpit because there you're
[1:28:51] actually um
[1:28:54] offering into his hands your
[1:28:56] congregation amen and um the prophet of
[1:29:01] God said the most precious thing you
[1:29:04] know that we could ever hold in our hand
[1:29:06] would be the blood of the Lord Jesus
[1:29:09] outside of the purchase of that
[1:29:11] blood and by the grace of God then we
[1:29:14] have the purchase of his blood here this
[1:29:17] evening how many believe that do you
[1:29:20] believe you're the purchase of the
[1:29:22] blood then you're more precious in God's
[1:29:25] sight than his own blood if he didn't
[1:29:27] think he was more precious he would have
[1:29:29] never made the transaction at
[1:29:31] Calvary but I'm glad he did brother
[1:29:34] croan I'm glad he did yeah we used to
[1:29:37] sing that song I don't know why Jesus
[1:29:39] loved me but I'm so glad he did amen but
[1:29:43] you know we're beginning to understand a
[1:29:45] little bit more about why that he loved
[1:29:47] us amen with the great elective love
[1:29:49] right and so we really really appreciate
[1:29:51] all the comments that have already been

[1:32:08] program in fact they had a clean up
[1:32:10] dayto dat at the church and to get

[1:33:26] John 4 the disciples come to try to get
[1:33:29] him to eat you know but he was about the
[1:33:32] father's business and he said I have
[1:33:35] meat that you know not of my meat is to
[1:33:38] do the will of him who sent me and to
[1:33:41] finish his work and so he had such a
[1:33:44] spiritual appetite that he wasn't even
[1:33:46] hungry for the middles even though it
[1:33:47] was past noon it was after dinner time
[1:33:51] so I hope y all didn't just come to get

[1:34:15] right is that okay pastor give me
[1:34:19] opportunity to receive an offering now

[1:34:49] Scorch and uh if we'll set our heart and
[1:34:52] affections on things

[1:34:56] help us Amen to be able to sit in
[1:34:58] Heavenly places in Christ Jesus and
[1:35:02] that's what we're here for is that right
[1:35:05] and so let's just for a few minutes

[1:35:13] just appreciate brother Wade and brother
[1:35:14] Dale and and the camaraderie that we've
[1:35:17] had The Godly affections and um I trust
[1:35:21] that the Lord will just continue to BU
[1:35:23] our hearts together in Christian love
[1:35:26] there's healing and
[1:35:28] fellowship and um he sent his word and
[1:35:32] healed them so where the word of the
[1:35:34] Lord is there's power word the king is
[1:35:36] there's power and there's healing amen
[1:35:39] and we believe that God has given us uh
[1:35:41] uh his word in this hour amen and um any
[1:35:45] one of these ministers the first one to
[1:35:47] start off tonight I thought boy that's
[1:35:49] just the leadership of the Holy Spirit
[1:35:52] In fact I didn't have my mind made up
[1:35:54] they come back there brother longor and
[1:35:56] ask me what's what's your title I said I
[1:35:58] don't know
[1:35:59] yet and but just about uh 10 minutes ago
[1:36:03] I told them what the title of my sermon
[1:36:05] is but now we better take our text
[1:36:08] before we talk about the title okay amen
[1:36:11] and if you'd like to stand we'll uh
[1:36:14] invite you to turn to the Book of Joshua
[1:36:17] my was wishing I had I've got two sons
[1:36:20] That's not married
[1:36:22] yet and seen these young saintly looking
[1:36:26] young ladies I was wishing I'd at least
[1:36:27] got my sons over
[1:36:30] here
[1:36:34] amen praise the
[1:36:36] lord well maybe we can get some of y'all
[1:36:39] over our way
[1:36:41] sometime amen let's go to Joshua
[1:36:45] chapter
[1:36:47] 10 Joshua 10 and we'll begin reading
[1:36:51] with verse 12
[1:36:54] and um I believe this is where the
[1:36:56] Prophet taking his text when he preached
[1:37:01] Paradox and uh but let's read here
[1:37:05] Joshua 10 and 12 if you have it say Amen
[1:37:10] am then spake Joshua to the Lord in the
[1:37:13] day when the Lord delivered up the
[1:37:16] amorites before the children of Israel
[1:37:19] and he said in the sight of Israel son
[1:37:22] stand th thou still upon gibian yeah and
[1:37:27] thou moon in the valley of
[1:37:30] aelon and the sun Stood Still and the
[1:37:34] moon stayed until the people had Avenged
[1:37:38] themselves upon their
[1:37:42] enemies is not this written in the book
[1:37:45] of
[1:37:46] jaser so the sun Stood
[1:37:50] Still in the midst of Heaven and hasten
[1:37:54] not to go
[1:37:55] down about a whole
[1:37:58] day and from this scripture reading I
[1:38:01] want to take my
[1:38:03] title
[1:38:06] why time has
[1:38:10] stopped
[1:38:12] why time has
[1:38:19] stopped we've already
[1:38:22] prayed I want you to just reach over and
[1:38:26] shake your brother's hand your sister's
[1:38:28] hand beside you or behind you say God
[1:38:31] bless you Pilgrim it's good to be in
[1:38:34] Fellowship God bless you brother thank
[1:38:36] real honored to be here and then if you
[1:38:38] do that I'll let you be
[1:38:42] seated
[1:38:48] amen and um you know
[1:38:55] oldtimers I I I really got a little
[1:38:59] laugh back there in the
[1:39:02] study these um olders joshing one
[1:39:06] another about their
[1:39:08] shape and the
[1:39:11] weight and um I thought you know
[1:39:14] that's you know we never get up to the
[1:39:17] pyramid Capstone of love until we at
[1:39:20] first half brotherly kindness yeah
[1:39:25] and after hearing these brothers you
[1:39:27] know P these comments about one another
[1:39:30] I thought well man at least they have
[1:39:32] they've got to brotherly kindness
[1:39:35] because brotherly kindness is putting up
[1:39:36] with one another yeah that's what the
[1:39:39] prophet's definition of brother
[1:39:41] brotherly kindness is and we'll never
[1:39:44] get to the Capstone of love if we can't
[1:39:46] put up with one another but when you
[1:39:48] start talking about man's weight and his
[1:39:50] shape and his age it takes a lot of
[1:39:54] Grace and uh but I
[1:39:56] appreciate the good sense of humor that
[1:40:00] we have I've made the statement if I
[1:40:03] didn't have a little sense of humor I
[1:40:05] probably wouldn't have much sense at all
[1:40:07] you know but I'm glad for a little sense
[1:40:09] at least little sense of
[1:40:11] humor and
[1:40:13] uh but now in all
[1:40:18] sincerity and I think I I I know some of
[1:40:22] the others and maybe even other
[1:40:24] ministers um I know the pastors have
[1:40:26] been recognized do we have any
[1:40:28] evangelist or any other ministers to
[1:40:31] today that has God bless y'all amen I
[1:40:34] want you to pull okay help me out here
[1:40:37] help me out I seen that brother when he
[1:40:39] got his Bible and got out of the car and
[1:40:40] I said that looks like a minister and so
[1:40:44] I uh now here in this let's
[1:40:48] just let's pray in our hearts now
[1:40:53] the prophet of God said what you need is
[1:40:55] not be up here on the pull pit or on the
[1:40:57] platform what you need is to have faith
[1:41:00] in God and so right here tonight we have
[1:41:05] come not just to fellowship with one
[1:41:07] another but we've come to fellowship
[1:41:10] with him he wants our
[1:41:14] fellowship
[1:41:15] amen and um I believe with all my heart
[1:41:20] God has stopped time yes
[1:41:24] waiting for the Readiness of the
[1:41:27] church and I believe that beyond a
[1:41:30] shadow of doubt if you believe the
[1:41:31] Vindicated message of the hour I'll be
[1:41:34] able to convict you tonight because at
[1:41:38] the mouth of two or three Witnesses let
[1:41:39] every word be established you might say
[1:41:42] my time piece is still
[1:41:45] ticking the calendar is still
[1:41:48] flipping but I want to show you
[1:41:51] tonight by Vindicated message from
[1:41:55] God at least about a half a dozen
[1:41:58] locations come on where the prophet of
[1:42:01] God said that God has reached out his
[1:42:04] great hand and stopped time amen other
[1:42:08] places he said he holding
[1:42:12] time other places he said it's past time
[1:42:16] yeah and God is waiting for the
[1:42:19] Readiness of the church for us it's not
[1:42:24] us waiting on
[1:42:26] God God is waiting on
[1:42:29] us right and I believe with all my heart
[1:42:32] tonight I believe in this little service
[1:42:35] right here the Lord wants to speak to
[1:42:38] each of us yes and convince us of our
[1:42:44] responsibility that's it of our position
[1:42:47] of our
[1:42:48] Authority
[1:42:50] and how that the scriptures must be
[1:42:53] fulfilled amen before he can come amen
[1:42:57] and he's waiting on us to fulfill those
[1:43:00] scriptures
[1:43:02] am how many believe Jesus Christ is the
[1:43:05] principal theme of the entire
[1:43:08] Bible he is the principal theme of the
[1:43:10] Old Testament of the New Testament and
[1:43:14] if he is in us then that would make us
[1:43:17] then something principal in that
[1:43:20] thing amen like the brother said fire on
[1:43:24] the altar it should be fire in our heart
[1:43:26] where the altar really is hallelujah and
[1:43:30] so I'm going to encourage you as brother
[1:43:32] Wade said I he said when he turned me
[1:43:34] out of the shoot back there he said now
[1:43:36] seek
[1:43:37] him and I thought well you just keep on
[1:43:39] seeking me and the way we do that is by
[1:43:42] saying Amen to the
[1:43:44] word not to the man but to the word
[1:43:47] right and we understand that at one
[1:43:50] place the prophet of God said this
[1:43:51] business is not saying amen come from
[1:43:54] the Baptist or the
[1:43:56] Methodist from there it come from the
[1:43:58] Catholic and from there it come from the
[1:44:00] pits of
[1:44:02] hell this business of not saying amen so
[1:44:06] I tell you
[1:44:08] what maybe I just like to say this
[1:44:10] before we go
[1:44:13] forward how would you sisters that are
[1:44:16] here tonight young or old La have had
[1:44:19] the responsibility that Mary had to con
[1:44:23] re the word give birth to the word nurse
[1:44:26] the word train the word teach the word
[1:44:28] and bring that word to maturity right
[1:44:32] how would you like to have that
[1:44:34] responsibility you Brothers how would
[1:44:36] you like to have the
[1:44:38] responsibility that Joseph
[1:44:41] had overseeing and keeping safe and
[1:44:46] providing for and helping to bring that
[1:44:49] word to full maturity oh my let me tell
[1:44:52] you something something you have that
[1:44:56] same
[1:44:57] responsibility you and I brother sister
[1:45:01] young or old we all have that same
[1:45:05] responsibility
[1:45:08] today prophet of God said the secret is
[1:45:11] this the word is in the bride as it was
[1:45:14] in
[1:45:16] Mary the more he said when you receive
[1:45:19] Jesus Christ or the Holy Ghost it's like
[1:45:22] Christ in be formed right
[1:45:25] Hallelujah and one place he said we can
[1:45:28] nurse him like Murray did by saying
[1:45:31] praise the Lord hallelujah glory to God
[1:45:35] Amen you know some people just don't
[1:45:37] want to
[1:45:38] nurse they don't want to be nursed they
[1:45:40] want to put a bottle somebody else say
[1:45:43] the amen you know stick a bottle or a
[1:45:45] paci maybe but we understand that we
[1:45:49] have that privilege and we have that
[1:45:51] responsibility of in the
[1:45:54] word right
[1:45:57] tonight
[1:45:59] amen right amen and it's more than
[1:46:05] just that's part of it I'm thankful for
[1:46:07] all the knobs now but don't be afraid to
[1:46:10] say
[1:46:11] Amen if it's you bear witness the word
[1:46:14] Bears witness in your soul ready don't
[1:46:17] amen the wrong thing now that's right
[1:46:21] don't just get carried away
[1:46:23] be sure that it goes through the filter
[1:46:26] Amen
[1:46:32] Hallelujah Jesus was the word made flesh
[1:46:38] yes
[1:46:40] Hallelujah and we understand that there
[1:46:44] was six Overcomers in the days of John
[1:46:46] the Baptist that was Joseph and Mary
[1:46:48] Zachariah and Elizabeth Simeon and Anna
[1:46:50] just six
[1:46:53] just
[1:46:55] six that's right all the rest of them in
[1:46:58] the message how can I overcome brother
[1:47:01] said they offered their sacrifices they
[1:47:03] worshiped maybe there were hundreds
[1:47:05] thousands millions but only six that's
[1:47:09] what he were these were the elected ones
[1:47:11] he said yes these were the elected ones
[1:47:14] but you realize that Joseph and Mary
[1:47:16] left the
[1:47:20] word how many knows what the first
[1:47:22] recorded words of the Lord Jesus in the
[1:47:25] New Testament that's
[1:47:28] right how many knows what's the first
[1:47:31] red letter recorded words of the Lord
[1:47:33] Jesus first words that he
[1:47:39] spoke it might be the last words he
[1:47:41] speaks also but he's still speaking
[1:47:43] we're glad for that but what did he say
[1:47:46] when he was just 12 years old the first
[1:47:48] recorded words knowest thou not that's
[1:47:51] right how is it that you seek me that
[1:47:55] was his first words how is it that you
[1:47:58] sought
[1:47:59] me knowest thou not that I must be about
[1:48:04] my father's business yes that's right
[1:48:07] and anybody was asking a question and he
[1:48:10] was also bringing a
[1:48:12] rebuke he was rebuking his own mom and
[1:48:16] daddy in the
[1:48:18] presence
[1:48:21] of of all the elders and all the
[1:48:26] priests but I said that to say this that
[1:48:30] the elect can't leave the word we get
[1:48:33] the idea oh we're so predestinated we're
[1:48:36] so right and we're so much the bride of
[1:48:39] Christ go
[1:48:42] now Joseph and Mary both left the
[1:48:45] word supposing him to have been in the I
[1:48:49] like to put it like this the Bible says
[1:48:51] in the company in their kin folks and so
[1:48:53] forth but the little Church of Nazareth
[1:48:55] had come down to the Church of
[1:48:57] Jerusalem you find this in Luke chap 2
[1:49:00] I'm not going to preach on that but I
[1:49:01] just felt to bring it in
[1:49:04] amen amen amen thank you the Church of
[1:49:07] Nazareth it was their custom to go down
[1:49:09] and have a
[1:49:10] convention at Jerusalem God's chosen
[1:49:13] place of worship where God had put his
[1:49:15] name and here it was the most important
[1:49:19] Feast the Feast of
[1:49:21] Passover and and the Passover
[1:49:24] Lamb Jesus Christ was at the Passover
[1:49:29] feast and they left the
[1:49:32] word wow the elected ones left the
[1:49:36] word you say I don't know about that
[1:49:38] brother Hugh listen when brother Ram
[1:49:40] seen the bride passing in review come on
[1:49:42] right he seen the church pass first
[1:49:44] right the true bride and then he seen
[1:49:46] come back around finally the last but he
[1:49:48] noticed that some of them long for the
[1:49:51] last was getting out the step
[1:49:56] right in the message how can I overcome
[1:49:59] brother said Le deia needed a sharp
[1:50:03] rebuke
[1:50:06] amen and he said it
[1:50:08] twice and then not only does
[1:50:15] the not only does the Sheep go astray
[1:50:19] yeah but sometimes Shepherds go astray
[1:50:21] too
[1:50:23] yeah how many believe
[1:50:25] that and if the blind lead the blind
[1:50:28] where they going to end up right amen
[1:50:31] amen so we
[1:50:33] understand
[1:50:35] that the voice of God come to be our
[1:50:39] guide and God still speaks through a
[1:50:43] fold
[1:50:45] ministry right
[1:50:48] amen and he still speaks through his
[1:50:51] prophet and the Spirit and the prophet
[1:50:53] and the bride all say the same thing
[1:50:56] right do you know Joseph and Mary
[1:50:59] represented the
[1:51:01] Ley yeah they were just common people
[1:51:03] Joseph wasn't a minister Mary wasn't a
[1:51:06] minister zachari and Elizabeth was now
[1:51:09] right yes so you have six Overcomers
[1:51:14] Joseph and Mary Zachariah and Elizabeth
[1:51:17] represented the ministry brother said go
[1:51:19] listen to it and then Simeon and
[1:51:23] Anna a prophet and prophetess right
[1:51:27] Hallelujah so you got your six classes
[1:51:30] or three classes rather of
[1:51:33] Overcomers
[1:51:35] now
[1:51:37] nowh do you find where Simeon had to be
[1:51:42] corrected not saying that God didn't
[1:51:44] correct him in his lifetime but in the
[1:51:45] Bible I'm talking about but you know
[1:51:47] what the Joseph and Mary had to stand
[1:51:51] corrected
[1:51:52] right Zachariah had to stand correctly
[1:51:56] right I believe it's probably one of the
[1:51:58] first cases of Divine Healing in the New
[1:52:00] Testament he was healed of his
[1:52:04] um sealed lips
[1:52:08] dumbness and I believe it might be one
[1:52:10] of the last things that takes place too
[1:52:12] is whenever us message ministers gets
[1:52:15] the dumbness out of our voice where we
[1:52:18] can speak the word of God Amen now think
[1:52:21] about it Zachariah was was an
[1:52:23] overcomer he was a message preacher
[1:52:26] don't tell me he wasn't yeah he had
[1:52:29] received a message from the angel same
[1:52:31] angel that visited
[1:52:34] Mary but he doubted the
[1:52:36] message he questioned it in the wrong
[1:52:38] way now it looks like Mary questioned it
[1:52:41] but see it was a different attitude that
[1:52:42] Mary had right amen she wasn't spitten D
[1:52:47] that's right but when Zachariah
[1:52:50] questioned the angel messenger
[1:52:53] see and I think that's the problem many
[1:52:56] times we get too much up
[1:52:59] here amen instead of the new birth we
[1:53:01] want an intellectual conception
[1:53:03] something we can understand instead of
[1:53:06] believe
[1:53:07] got let me tell you something God never
[1:53:10] did call you first to understand and
[1:53:12] then to believe we do not understand in
[1:53:15] order to believe we believe in order to
[1:53:19] understand believe first then the
[1:53:21] revelation
[1:53:23] come understanding will come God want
[1:53:26] you to follow the guide you're not
[1:53:29] subject to discern which direction to go
[1:53:31] without a guide you don't try to go to
[1:53:34] British Columbia and go on a moose hunt
[1:53:36] or elk hunt without a guide that guy has
[1:53:38] to sign your license he's responsible
[1:53:41] for you yeah and he is officially
[1:53:44] appointed by the government to be a guy
[1:53:47] and I'm not talking about British
[1:53:48] Columbia I'm talking about the Church of
[1:53:51] the Living God and God has promised the
[1:53:54] Holy Ghost in This Hour to be our Gody
[1:53:57] and he S A Vindicated guy the Vindicated
[1:54:00] messenger a Vindicated
[1:54:03] message you question that gu you're lost
[1:54:07] I don't care who you are you try to
[1:54:09] interpret his directions you try to
[1:54:13] interpret or misconstrue oh I think it
[1:54:16] ought to be this way or it ought to be
[1:54:17] that way you better stay just the way
[1:54:19] the guy Le Hallelujah
[1:54:23] oh brother may the Lord help us that's
[1:54:27] for you and that's for
[1:54:29] me Church age book brother BR said in
[1:54:32] every age the church goes
[1:54:35] astray are we still in an
[1:54:37] age you say oh it's a bride age nobody
[1:54:40] can go astray be careful and more astray
[1:54:42] in this
[1:54:45] age oh
[1:54:47] my in every age the church goes astray
[1:54:50] and not only the Ley but clergy goes
[1:54:53] astray too shepherds are wrong as well
[1:54:56] as
[1:54:57] sheep and when I point my finger out
[1:54:59] preaching the gospel I know I got three
[1:55:01] more pointing back at me and I believe
[1:55:04] in Shepherds Hallelujah yeah and
[1:55:07] questions and answers on the seals
[1:55:09] brother BR was asked will the bride have
[1:55:11] a Ministry brother BR before the Rapture
[1:55:13] he said well sure he said it's going on
[1:55:16] right now it consists of Apostles
[1:55:18] prophets evangelists pastors and
[1:55:20] teachers amen
[1:55:23] oh right yes sir and so we see that God
[1:55:28] has a true five-fold
[1:55:30] Ministry amen but the only way that we
[1:55:33] can know amen hallelujah how was how did
[1:55:38] they know in that first age brother C
[1:55:41] how did they know in that first Ephesian
[1:55:44] age Jesus commanded
[1:55:47] them for trying the
[1:55:50] apostles yeah that's right thou H has
[1:55:52] tried those who call themselves Apostles
[1:55:56] I think one of the first signs of a
[1:55:58] false false Apostle is one who calls
[1:55:59] himself an
[1:56:02] apostle I'm this or I'm that go ahead
[1:56:04] now but thou has DED them and how did
[1:56:08] they try them they tried him by the word
[1:56:10] of the age you're not saying what Paul
[1:56:13] said right he say right oh my and if
[1:56:19] they're not speaking according to the
[1:56:21] law and the prophets there's no light in
[1:56:24] them
[1:56:25] Hallelujah yes throughout Seven Ages the
[1:56:29] church is going astray and shepherds are
[1:56:32] wrong as well as sheep right in that
[1:56:35] same paragraph brother Ram said but then
[1:56:37] through the ministry of these seven
[1:56:39] Messengers God Capital God brings
[1:56:43] himself on the scene as the chief
[1:56:47] shepher let me tell you something the CH
[1:56:50] shepher never goes astray no the chief
[1:56:53] Shepherd never leads astray Hallelujah
[1:56:57] you might leave the word but the word
[1:56:59] ain't going to leave
[1:57:00] you oh my Joseph and Mary went about a
[1:57:05] Day's Journey and then they
[1:57:07] realized that they left the
[1:57:10] word they realized that they had left
[1:57:13] the word and when they did the Bible
[1:57:16] says after 3 days right they found him
[1:57:21] right
[1:57:23] that's right now it was only a day
[1:57:24] Journey away from
[1:57:27] him but it was at least two maybe two
[1:57:30] and a half days to find him and you know
[1:57:34] where he was right where they left
[1:57:38] him that's where they found him and
[1:57:40] that's where you'll find him that's
[1:57:43] where I'll find him when I leave the
[1:57:45] word I got to go right back to that word
[1:57:47] because when you leave the word you
[1:57:49] leave God
[1:57:52] there's only one reason young man young
[1:57:56] lady teenager young or old there's only
[1:58:00] one reason for God's displeasure with
[1:58:03] you and I and that's for you to leave
[1:58:05] the
[1:58:06] word that's for me to leave the word and
[1:58:09] there's only one remedy to regain his
[1:58:12] favor that's back to the word back to
[1:58:15] the word
[1:58:18] repent and come back to the word every
[1:58:22] new and fresh Revival every true and

[1:59:43] yes oh
[1:59:45] my yes amen God's identification is
[1:59:49] never with the group
[1:59:54] that might not sound too popular but
[1:59:56] that's the word of the
[1:59:58] Lord can I say that
[2:00:01] again I'm quoting your Prophet you ought
[2:00:03] to know what he said he said it God's
[2:00:06] identification is never with a group
[2:00:10] God's identification is always with the
[2:00:14] individual Hallelujah Always With the
[2:00:17] Enemy so he is in the church praise God
[2:00:20] so he is in the bride praise God but
[2:00:23] what about in you yeah what about me
[2:00:27] that's what
[2:00:28] counts he's not going to ask you amen is
[2:00:31] he with your mama and your
[2:00:33] daddy he's going to say Amen is he in
[2:00:36] your
[2:00:37] heart I will not leave you comfortless I
[2:00:41] will come unto you oh we need that
[2:00:44] guide Amen to uh help us not only to
[2:00:49] read the lines but to show us what's
[2:00:52] between
[2:00:53] the when you fall in love with him oh my
[2:00:58] fall in love with the
[2:00:59] GU then you can have
[2:01:02] Assurance amen you know where you come
[2:01:04] from you know where you're going you
[2:01:07] know the count of the Cadence of God's
[2:01:09] word thank you Lord bear with me
[2:01:12] now I'll tell you what the word of the
[2:01:15] Lord he said as many as I love I will
[2:01:18] rebuke
[2:01:19] Jesus you might have a little you coming
[2:01:22] this
[2:01:23] evening you might have a little
[2:01:25] chastisement
[2:01:26] coming if you do say thank you Lord for
[2:01:30] your
[2:01:31] love thank you Lord for your love thank
[2:01:34] you for speaking to me
[2:01:36] Lord oh yes that's a good sure
[2:01:40] indication Hallelujah that he loves you
[2:01:43] yes oh my but one thing about the El
[2:01:47] they'll always come back to the word
[2:01:51] might leave the word but one thing for
[2:01:54] sure always come
[2:01:56] back the Bible says after 3 days they
[2:02:00] found him is that right oh my yes and so
[2:02:06] we see that it's
[2:02:10] um very serious thing to leave the word
[2:02:15] now this evening I'd like to remind you
[2:02:17] that God loves Fellowship this is
[2:02:20] fellowship meeting right
[2:02:24] God so loves
[2:02:27] Fellowship that his only purpose of
[2:02:31] existence is fellowship with his
[2:02:34] family God so loves Fellowship that the
[2:02:37] only personal request that Jesus asked
[2:02:40] for in St John 17 prayer was for your
[2:02:44] fellowship God so loves
[2:02:48] Fellowship how would you like to be the
[2:02:50] only one exist exting in eternity how
[2:02:53] would you like to be eloh
[2:02:55] him the self-existing
[2:02:58] one I'd get pretty lome wouldn't
[2:03:00] you you know when God made man he said
[2:03:03] it's good good first 2 3 4 5 six day but
[2:03:05] on the sixth day when he made man his
[2:03:07] own likeness in his own image he said
[2:03:08] it's very good and then next chapter he
[2:03:11] said it's not
[2:03:12] good for man to be alone that's right
[2:03:15] amen God wants fellowship and so we see
[2:03:19] that brother BR put it like this he said
[2:03:21] go
[2:03:22] in order to give himself a reason for
[2:03:26] being had to predestinate a church that
[2:03:29] would need
[2:03:30] Redemption we look at brother Brenham
[2:03:32] trying to commit
[2:03:34] suicide tried his best right is that
[2:03:38] right with a gun tried it with the
[2:03:39] Highline War didn't work what was being
[2:03:43] reflected God's lonesomeness he had just
[2:03:46] lost part of his family he just lost his
[2:03:48] sweetheart his
[2:03:50] bride and God whole purpose of existence
[2:03:53] today is his bride his whole purpose
[2:03:57] before the foundation of the world was
[2:03:58] the
[2:03:59] church
[2:04:01] Hallelujah in other words God's purpose
[2:04:04] of existence his main purpose is not to
[2:04:06] create the universe and the universe and
[2:04:09] the the milky white way and all the
[2:04:14] great but it's
[2:04:15] you you're the purpose of God's
[2:04:18] existence and without you
[2:04:21] God's main
[2:04:23] purpose I don't like to use the term
[2:04:25] spiritual suicide but he'd have a
[2:04:27] tendency to want to commit
[2:04:30] suicide but he's got a purpose he's got
[2:04:32] a plan and that plan will not be
[2:04:36] defeated God wants your
[2:04:38] fellowship he want and he can't have it
[2:04:41] when you leave the word no he can only
[2:04:44] have it as you Fellowship in the
[2:04:47] word his Fellowship is in the son and
[2:04:50] his son is the word his Fellowship is
[2:04:52] under the blood is that right and
[2:04:55] there's least about 11 places where
[2:04:57] brother said Jesus is sitting there with
[2:04:59] his own bloody garments right now
[2:05:03] Hallelujah interceding for you and
[2:05:06] I his own bloody garments think about it
[2:05:11] he didn't go away naked he went away
[2:05:13] with those bloody
[2:05:14] garments representing the blood
[2:05:18] Hallelujah that was shed for you and I
[2:05:21] today it's not just the chemistry of the
[2:05:23] blood but the bleeding word of God is
[2:05:26] bleeding blood to wash the bride in and
[2:05:29] it's been rejected aresh crucified aresh
[2:05:33] yes Hallelujah let's not amen be guilty
[2:05:37] of the second crucifixion of Jesus
[2:05:39] Christ let's be sure we don't change the
[2:05:42] word we're not called to change the word
[2:05:46] we're called to believe the word we're
[2:05:48] called to obey the word is that right
[2:05:51] amen sure we're not here to get the
[2:05:54] people to ourselves we're not here to
[2:05:56] get the people to the church we're here
[2:05:58] to get the people to
[2:05:59] Christ Christ is
[2:06:02] the oh my sure he comes through the
[2:06:05] church sure thank God for the church
[2:06:09] amen but let's be sure that we're
[2:06:11] putting him first and letting him have
[2:06:14] the
[2:06:15] preeminence
[2:06:18] amen the great man calls himself a
[2:06:22] bishop of many of the churches in
[2:06:25] Africa we had a communion foot

[2:06:55] ourselves did we come just to be
[2:06:58] served or we come to serve if the son of
[2:07:02] man is in US amen we need to Humble
[2:07:06] ourselves the key to power the secret to
[2:07:09] power we're taught is
[2:07:11] humility the disciples right up at the
[2:07:14] communion supper in the Passover chamber
[2:07:16] were busing about who's going to be the
[2:07:19] greatest
[2:07:20] leader going to be the greatest message
[2:07:23] Pastor or who's going to be the Apostle
[2:07:26] who's going to be the general Overseer
[2:07:27] in the
[2:07:28] message because Jesus is talking about
[2:07:31] leaving and they were arguing right at
[2:07:34] the last right at the communion

[2:07:40] table of the Lord busing about who's

[2:08:05] unveiled they were fussing about who's
[2:08:07] going to be the greatest and he showed
[2:08:09] him who was the greatest and he showed
[2:08:11] him how to be the greatest because he
[2:08:14] GED himself only with the towel and he
[2:08:16] came down nobody offered to wash Jesus
[2:08:20] feet exactly on find it in the Bible at
[2:08:23] that communion supper not at the
[2:08:25] communion

[2:09:28] talking about that eagle that he he got
[2:09:30] out of the uh
[2:09:33] Barnyard and he said Lord take us away
[2:09:36] to the eagle nest where you can nurture

[2:10:15] still in the process of dying I thought
[2:10:18] that's real humble brother Dale and I
[2:10:20] think we all need to consider that yes
[2:10:23] are we still maybe in the process of
[2:10:26] dying out to ourselves to our own ideas
[2:10:30] to our own will to our own way Jesus
[2:10:33] said I've not come to do my own will but
[2:10:36] I've come to do the will of him or
[2:10:39] S you see even though you're born again
[2:10:42] God doesn't take away your self
[2:10:44] will he doesn't take away your free
[2:10:47] moral
[2:10:48] agency Jesus himself had a self-will
[2:10:52] Hallelujah and if he had to surrender
[2:10:55] his with desperation and prayer what
[2:10:57] about you and I desperation
[2:11:02] yes the greatest weapon ever put into
[2:11:05] the hand of man brother Bram said is
[2:11:08] prayer the greatest weapon put into the
[2:11:11] control of

[2:13:40] awake everybody happy amen oh
[2:13:46] boy and as they departed from
[2:13:49] Jericho a great multitude followed him
[2:13:53] and behold two blind men sitting by the
[2:13:55] wayside when they heard that Jesus
[2:13:58] passed by cried out saying have mercy on
[2:14:02] us oh Lord th son of David and the
[2:14:07] multitude rebuked them yeah because they
[2:14:11] uh should hold their
[2:14:13] peace but they cry the more yeah instead
[2:14:17] of getting quieter they got louder say
[2:14:19] Have Mercy oh on us oh Lord th son of
[2:14:24] David notice in verse
[2:14:26] 32 brother BR said Jesus
[2:14:29] didn't see blind barus amen he didn't
[2:14:34] even hear him
[2:14:35] calling because all the multitude and
[2:14:39] all the commotion was going on and he
[2:14:41] was off the beaten pack he wasn't right
[2:14:44] on the road uhhuh but he said he felt
[2:14:46] his faith amen hallelujah all right and
[2:14:51] the Bible says Jesus Stood Still Glory
[2:14:55] Hallelujah and called them and said
[2:15:00] what will ye that I should do and they
[2:15:03] said unto him Lord that our eyes may be
[2:15:06] opened amen so Jesus had compassion on
[2:15:09] them and touched their eyes and
[2:15:11] immediately their eyes received sight
[2:15:13] and they followed him wonder if maybe
[2:15:15] tonight we don't need our eyes open a
[2:15:17] little bit
[2:15:18] more we find the same incident I believe
[2:15:22] in
[2:15:23] Mark
[2:15:25] 10 and beginning with verse 46 and they
[2:15:28] came to Jericho and as he went out of
[2:15:30] Jericho his disciples with his disciples
[2:15:34] and a great number of people blind barus
[2:15:37] the son of
[2:15:38] timus Sat by the wayside begging just a
[2:15:43] blind
[2:15:45] beggar and when he heard that it was
[2:15:49] Jesus Oh my of Nazareth he began to cry
[2:15:53] out amen I believe we can still reach
[2:15:57] him
[2:15:57] by crying out to him don't you I he can
[2:16:01] still be touched by the feeling of our
[2:16:02] infirmities amen and say Jesus th son of
[2:16:06] David have mercy on me and many charged
[2:16:09] him that he should hold his
[2:16:12] peace but he cried the more a great deal
[2:16:15] th son of David have mercy on me and
[2:16:19] Jesus stood still right yeah only place
[2:16:23] in the Bible where you find where the
[2:16:26] Bible says that
[2:16:27] Jesus
[2:16:29] Stood
[2:16:31] Still in the Book of Joshua we see the
[2:16:35] creation right being stopped by Joshua's
[2:16:41] faith and the Sun and the Moon perhaps
[2:16:45] it was evening time how many seen the
[2:16:47] moon coming up while the sun still up
[2:16:49] sure maybe in the evening time oh my
[2:16:53] hallelujah what a good time when you
[2:16:56] realize time's running
[2:16:58] out Joshua with inspiration and Faith
[2:17:02] spoke and time had to stand still I
[2:17:06] haven't forgotten my text hold with me
[2:17:10] now here Joshua had stopped the
[2:17:14] creation in the heavens the moon the sun
[2:17:19] yes but here the the same kind of Faith
[2:17:23] but it was in blind B and he stopped the
[2:17:28] very Creator
[2:17:30] himself the one who created the son he
[2:17:33] stopped the Son of God hallelujah and
[2:17:36] our faith can stop him here
[2:17:38] tonight thank you Lord your faith can
[2:17:41] still reach him if you'll cry out but he
[2:17:45] wants you to be in desperation
[2:17:47] Hallelujah And when everybody else says
[2:17:49] be quiet it's not for you
[2:17:52] you got to know it is for you amen
[2:17:55] hallelujah
[2:17:57] amen yes one stopped the creation but
[2:18:01] the other stopped the Creator amen oh my
[2:18:06] just
[2:18:07] think he had
[2:18:10] been
[2:18:14] uh now let's just go forward a little
[2:18:17] bit here and I want to ask the question
[2:18:20] why
[2:18:23] why did Joshua do
[2:18:27] that
[2:18:29] why I'll tell you
[2:18:32] why because he need a little bit more
[2:18:34] time to fulfill the
[2:18:38] commission he needed a little bit more
[2:18:41] time to fulfill that Great Commission of
[2:18:43] that day to place the people in their
[2:18:47] inheritance to divide to them their
[2:18:50] promised land to drive out the enemy and
[2:18:54] to claim their possession the promised
[2:18:57] land and today these promises have been
[2:19:00] made to the
[2:19:01] right if God didn't know you needed a
[2:19:04] double portion he wouldn't have promised
[2:19:05] a double por if God didn't know I would
[2:19:08] need a double portion in this hour he
[2:19:10] wouldn't have promised a double por but
[2:19:13] we need it and God promised it and we
[2:19:17] can have it hallelujah oh my for for the
[2:19:21] day there has to be a faring time
[2:19:24] Hallelujah there has to be a quick short
[2:19:27] work Hallelujah I don't know what it's
[2:19:30] going to take but I do know one thing
[2:19:32] God has stopped time waiting for the
[2:19:35] Readiness of the church amen
[2:19:38] amen
[2:19:41] amen now when I kind of pretended ask
[2:19:46] permission to receive an
[2:19:48] offering tonight I was thinking about
[2:19:50] this quote right here am so follow along
[2:19:55] it's an expectancy 1952 brother BR said
[2:19:58] see obedience do what he tells you to do
[2:20:01] no matter what it looks like do what he
[2:20:04] says do and God will take care of the
[2:20:06] rest of it don't you think amen oh if
[2:20:10] the church could only get to a place
[2:20:13] where they just forgot about the routine
[2:20:19] am what about right here tonight when's
[2:20:22] the best time to start this when's the
[2:20:25] best time to obey the word only time you
[2:20:28] can't obey the word he in the
[2:20:31] Pres oh if the church only got to the
[2:20:34] place to where we just forgot about the
[2:20:38] routine or whatever it is just lose
[2:20:41] sense of time yeah or anything else and
[2:20:45] just stay with God do what he says do
[2:20:49] don't you believe the church needs a
[2:20:50] spiritual leading like that yes we got
[2:20:53] our programs all drawn out and lined out
[2:20:58] and so forth I don't believe it was ever
[2:21:01] intended for the Apostolic Church of God
[2:21:04] to be led by program I believe it's the
[2:21:07] program of God to lead us by his holy
[2:21:10] spirit just the way he
[2:21:14] will my
[2:21:17] yes our programs he says takes up all of
[2:21:19] our time
[2:21:21] in this uh worst sinter in the city
[2:21:25] 56 yes well our programs take up all of
[2:21:29] our time we got too many things to do so
[2:21:33] we uh got to be taken care of see and uh
[2:21:38] he said I wonder sometimes that maybe we
[2:21:40] hav it just went off without Jesus like
[2:21:43] the disciples did you know that night on
[2:21:45] the ship amen his own disciples went off
[2:21:48] without him that's when the storm hit is
[2:21:51] that right that's when all the devils in
[2:21:53] Hell swore amen that they would seink

[2:22:32] just one word she didn't disbelieve the
[2:22:35] whole book is just one word right is
[2:22:38] that right in the middle of the book

[2:30:47] it's the word in the body amen
[2:30:52] thank you come on he was asked the
[2:30:54] question what what does it mean brother
[2:30:55] B in Luke 24 or Matthew 24 where Jesus
[2:30:58] said wheresoever the carcass is there
[2:31:01] will the Eagles be gathered together

[2:32:02] the same thing yes amen now God didn't
[2:32:06] send me to correct brother
[2:32:10] brandom he didn't send the fivefold
[2:32:12] ministry to correct brother BR he s
[2:32:15] brother to correct the
[2:32:17] five is that right oh my and that's his
[2:32:21] love to us many as I love I will rebuke
[2:32:24] and Chason the word always corrects the
[2:32:26] error that's what he was doing the very
[2:32:28] first time that he spoke about the
[2:32:30] father's business correcting the
[2:32:32] denominational eras and if he's about
[2:32:34] that business here tonight he'll be
[2:32:36] doing the same thing in you he'll be

[2:32:41] thing stay with that word amen

[2:32:50] I believe
[2:32:51] that well if I didn't believe that I was
[2:32:54] in the will of the Lord I wouldn't be
[2:32:56] here but I believe it was the Lord that
[2:33:00] placed on brother Wade brother Dale for
[2:33:03] to ask me invite me to come and I didn't
[2:33:06] take that lightly I took it very
[2:33:07] seriously yes and U so you know if
[2:33:11] you're not doing what god listen what
[2:33:13] brother BR says here he said like this

[2:33:18] this God is so arranged it that his
[2:33:20] program cannot move without you and I
[2:33:23] amen as long as we're not doing what God
[2:33:26] leads us to do we're paralyzing his
[2:33:30] program oh my good paralyzing his
[2:33:35] program wow if the program of God is
[2:33:37] paralyzed time is stopped amen sure
[2:33:41] going to take it a little further here

[2:33:44] church moves by the anointing of the

[2:33:50] program am thank you Lord amen
[2:33:53] amen
[2:33:57] now
[2:34:00] expectations we've got to get back to do
[2:34:03] his great uh into into the program of
[2:34:07] God and find out after all what God
[2:34:10] wants us to do and the only way I know
[2:34:13] to do it is prayer prayer is the key
[2:34:18] yeah that's the answer prayer changes
[2:34:20] things prayer is the most powerful
[2:34:22] weapon that was ever put in the control
[2:34:25] of human beings there's no atomic bomb
[2:34:29] no hydrogen bomb as powerful as prayer
[2:34:33] hallelujah we're left without excuse
[2:34:36] amen amen it's put in your
[2:34:38] control you have that ability and when
[2:34:41] the weakest of Christians goes to their
[2:34:43] knees and prayer the foundations of Hell
[2:34:48] shiver the we
[2:34:53] amen I'm going to skip some of this here
[2:34:56] just going down now uh this is 1961 I
[2:34:59] want you to notice the time setting sir
[2:35:02] we would see Jesus Bloomington
[2:35:05] Illinois as our scientists tell us it's
[2:35:09] long ago 3 minutes until midnight yeah
[2:35:13] but we know we know this is the prophet
[2:35:16] of God speaking now we know the hand of
[2:35:19] God has stopped
[2:35:21] time to wait just long enough uh long
[2:35:26] just long suffering like he was in the
[2:35:29] days of Norah
[2:35:32] amen our differences yeah has turned him
[2:35:37] away our separation of
[2:35:41] Brotherhood and the way that we we've
[2:35:44] sent after the things of the world
[2:35:46] instead of the things of
[2:35:47] God we ought to have been Plum into
[2:35:50] canaan's
[2:35:52] land and here we are in the wilderness
[2:35:55] wandering around and around just like
[2:35:58] they did back there we should be having
[2:36:01] all kinds of gifts signs and wonders in
[2:36:03] our churches instead of that God can
[2:36:06] raise up something and then we all get
[2:36:09] scared of it and walk away and say we
[2:36:12] don't understand these
[2:36:14] things what do you think they done in
[2:36:16] the wilderness for 40 years walk around
[2:36:20] and around the same old grounds we took
[2:36:23] acts 24 acts 24 acts 24 we've run it to
[2:36:27] death let's go on I think they s about
[2:36:31] that tonight the promised land is
[2:36:35] there for whatsoever thing you desire
[2:36:39] When you pray believe you receive it and
[2:36:41] you shall have it acts 2 and for is
[2:36:44] right but it ain't all of it that's
[2:36:47] right there's more of it that's right
[2:36:50] that's every promise in the Bible is
[2:36:53] ours it's given to us by the Lord Jesus
[2:36:56] and his Great Mighty hand is holding
[2:37:01] time for us to possess the land that's
[2:37:04] been given to
[2:37:10] us ain't that why he stop time then
[2:37:14] waiting for them to possess the land
[2:37:17] right and the same thing has happened in
[2:37:19] this
[2:37:20] how many knows he call that an
[2:37:22] Ephesus Joshua parallels the book of
[2:37:25] Ephesians they had go listen to the a

[2:38:23] down and seeing its last sign Lord let

[2:38:34] under their nose and they don't realize
[2:38:39] it again um Abraham and his seed after
[2:38:45] him
[2:38:47] 61 do you know what God did he
[2:38:50] reached it's past time he reached out
[2:38:54] his hand and stopped it GL he's holding

[2:40:05] while I'm going to skip over some of
[2:40:07] these
[2:40:22] amen Lord
[2:40:25] Jesus I'm reminded the old I believe it
[2:40:30] was Buddy Robinson that brother Brandon
[2:40:33] quoted said Lord feel
[2:40:35] my Gable of my soul with good things and
[2:40:38] then nudge me when I've said
[2:40:41] enough oh Lord give me backbone like a
[2:40:44] solog yes Lord Lord let me fight the
[2:40:48] devil till I ain't got no more teeth in
[2:40:49] my head let me gum him till I die Lord
[2:40:52] let us be so determined and Lord these
[2:40:56] uh Elders here that I'm glad to be
[2:40:59] identified with them Lord but let us
[2:41:02] have that
[2:41:04] determination and father may we remember
[2:41:06] the prophet of God said if I had a
[2:41:07] choice it'd be that
[2:41:10] last 75 year or 25 years of my
[2:41:14] life oh my maybe from 75 to 100 I'd be
[2:41:17] more season more
[2:41:19] experienced more determined God renew
[2:41:23] our strength then as Eagles Lord yes
[2:41:25] father let us reexamine ourselves Lord
[2:41:28] and may these your children know that
[2:41:30] I'm not here thinking I'm I'm here to
[2:41:33] correct somebody God you know better
[2:41:35] Lord but Lord You're Here We Believe to
[2:41:38] correct us all and I stand Lord with my
[2:41:41] brothers and sisters and Lord we want to
[2:41:44] be right but father we want to be uh
[2:41:48] know that the only criteria that we have
[2:41:50] is to stay with the word even the
[2:41:53] manifestations that balum
[2:41:56] had
[2:41:58] prophesying of the star rising out of
[2:42:00] Jacob one of the greatest and most
[2:42:03] perfect prophecies given yet we know
[2:42:06] that he was not an elect of God
[2:42:09] cesis another great demonstration of the
[2:42:12] manifestation of God prophesying of how
[2:42:15] the Lord Jesus one must die not all
[2:42:17] Israel and
[2:42:20] yet we know that he there was no
[2:42:21] evidence or no scripture indicating that
[2:42:23] he was a spirit
[2:42:25] filled Lord may we not take a sensation
[2:42:28] may we not take an emotion may we not
[2:42:31] take a organization or an
[2:42:33] affiliation may we not take anything but
[2:42:36] the spirit of God and the word of God
[2:42:40] lord may you vindicate uh Beyond where
[2:42:44] we can Lord we cannot do it ourselves it
[2:42:47] takes you we can say We Believe but it
[2:42:49] takes you to confirm our faith Lord and
[2:42:52] you're here we believe to do that for
[2:42:54] every individual we haven't just time to
[2:42:56] fellowship with one another Lord but we
[2:42:59] desire your fellowship above all oh Lord
[2:43:02] Jesus and if we find oh Lord where that
[2:43:05] we've left the word any portion of that
[2:43:09] body word God if we've not been feeding
[2:43:12] on all that word then Lord grant Grace
[2:43:17] to repent here tonight as as it's
[2:43:19] written per Adventure that God would
[2:43:21] Grant repentance unto the
[2:43:22] acknowledgement of the
[2:43:24] truth and Lord we know the Zeal of the
[2:43:27] hour is to say yes Lord I'm wrong you're
[2:43:31] right Lord we think of Hebrews I believe
[2:43:34] it's chapter 11 the closing part the
[2:43:36] closing two or three verses how Paul
[2:43:39] talked about all these Heroes of Faith
[2:43:41] then he said and they without us are not
[2:43:44] made perfect brother Ram said they have
[2:43:47] to have this ministry to raise them up
[2:43:50] then Lord may we realize here this
[2:43:52] evening that we cannot have a
[2:43:54] resurrection and a Rapture until we each
[2:43:57] one come to our place till we let the
[2:43:59] word mature in us and Lord we mature in
[2:44:03] the word how can we uh ever recognize
[2:44:07] the revealed word our husband who is
[2:44:10] Among Us unless we're continually
[2:44:12] constantly in that word all being led by
[2:44:15] the spirit we remember the lord of the
[2:44:18] Harvest
[2:44:20] how before he sent out the 12 also
[2:44:22] before he sent out the 70 he said you
[2:44:24] pray said to them to the 12 to the 70
[2:44:27] pray ye the lord of the Harvest that
[2:44:28] he'll send forth labors into the Harvest
[2:44:31] then your servant and Prophet ask the
[2:44:33] question why if he is the lord of the
[2:44:35] Harvest and we know he is why knowing
[2:44:39] that they he's going to do it why did he
[2:44:40] ask them to pray yes because God's
[2:44:44] program cannot work without you and I
[2:44:47] even the preaching of the Gospel oh my
[2:44:50] everything it's the program of God so
[2:44:53] Lord help us now not to paralyze the
[2:44:57] program of God yes because when we do
[2:44:59] Lord we're responsible for the stopping
[2:45:03] of
[2:45:04] time but God when we're in your program
[2:45:08] fulfilling the Great Commission we know
[2:45:10] Lord until that last one comes in there
[2:45:12] will be no Resurrection there will be no
[2:45:15] Rapture you must stay there and
[2:45:17] intercede till that last one com in and
[2:45:19] you will not be satisfied the great
[2:45:21] Shepherd will not be satisfied until
[2:45:24] that last predestination comes the let
[2:45:28] us have that cry then other sheep have I
[2:45:31] oh that are not of this fo let us reach
[2:45:33] out Lord to the regions Beyond let us
[2:45:37] have a burden like Jesus had oh the same
[2:45:40] burden for he said as the father sent me
[2:45:43] so send I you help us Lord to be a real
