don't send her the whole church uh we were looking at the first scene and I said to the people now we know brother brother told us what it was that decreased breath I said but what have I asked you to find me a scripture to show me what it was could you do it and of course the great scholars they are they were looking to one another and oil you know I said well it's there hey man it's there because this guy he's on identified a man you don't know who he is a lot of the grid scholars thought it was the Holy Spirit Todd not amen I'm he's got a bow but there's no record of any ours with them another words he's a bluffer good that's the silly you wouldn't quit honking in it won't move the ball and walk around for your gig diva you don't the darkness so anyway and I said there is a scripture that will tell us a minute ssin in Revelation 18 Revelation 19 verse 11 it says that he sat on a white horse and he that sat on him right Amen was called faithful and true no word of God was on his left to right man see so he identifies himself he always identify himself a man exact I'm not as wonderful I knots that's what's good thing that you'll know this fella he wouldn't identify himself but Jesus Christ all as well right and you know who who is right never reckless you don't have to guess who Revelation 19 right 11s and of course amen brother branham taught us which is absolutely correct that it was the Antichrist spirit and not foresee that one for a min prison ward a midnight let's look at this a little bit because I want to get into ah the prophet comes to the word book there's more than that there's more than I I'm not and revel and revel I'm sorry ah that would be in Genesis amen Genesis 15 I'm sure it's a familiar structure but our 13 to 16 I know when Abraham was a tone of God that his seed would be four hundred years and now and a foreign land amen even talked about somewhere where they wouldn't even recognize the language wouldn't understand me and people have lost me hard hard are you do not I'm really ah it's just one of those things in your life it's a phenomenal that God has always give us an interpreter you enjoyed the language oh you know if you didn't have that for something you'll tend to a girl with he'd be lost you know but he's always there there's all having so many do enterprise and there's always ungodly person to do it because they need to be in The Sims 4 as you are to get not word out you know and here was amen and what is actually happening here it's the word that's God Himself m is the word coming to the property of your honor I i I'm speaking over to him a man that they would be in this line for 400 years I'm done unless what happened now I may come back to this in a moment because when you get to the purifier but that's what happened amen exactly friendly clear to the matter they would call it with grip softness and they did that amen so are the chances of these things happening are so many women be really millions to one right but you could speak of it all them things that you stroll around and it just happened amen right ah that people would believe that all that we are today came from a big barn yeah i mean not us that's asking a lot okay all right that's asking a lot I'm they're changing all the time all right but I'm not going to go to amen it's time hey man I / brunch said we found it in the church hinges we prayed in the Old Testament each time there comes a certain manifestation of the journey so I'm glad amen but not enough profit was in the water Amen in 1833 will not

Eiger whole folks you need something to hold onto I knew died in his darkest hour he would say to himself now who was not that talk to me yeah honey knew it was gone right I said I believe it amen I

with him today I'm brother brother brought the third part of it the third exodus that if we keep the condition tape I said was Captain the first accident right as I say Gordon never changes his mind amen so the conditions are the first one will be exactly the conditions in the side not their accents amen and if God keeps his word the cop when she does then it would reflect God and it will identify gore amen and that's the way he said light comes today no I'm going to just put this in because it's it's got another cool at the bottom that I would like you to get but um amen when the word is tested what hold amen I remember and one of the bottles and have it up in Gettysburg and you know it their buttons are hot and heavy it's not chanceplay people are dying for real your best friend could be shot beside you and didn't matter amen I'm dad so it was in a terrible difficulty another part of the battlefield I'm there and one of the generals rolled up and he must have came to the journal of a regimen and he said sir he said can you hold he said I think we can he said sir I never asked you what you thought he said can you hope I don't know he said yes sir he said we are not moving hallelujah we are not remember we're going to stand right here how do we have enough to wear this with a word of God today all right at home I can hold ya des hold me I could hold say Mary and it goes with move a man and so here was your science you know Sciences up mostly they tell you that their grip darn things is observation I'm testability yeah so therefore any sadness was to be talking this language and has to be observed an has to be tested that's why when they talk about the grapevine how much nuns I can you observe something that they say helping 15 by the music okay yeah I mean were you hoping even in a circle right you know how are you gonna test it hallelujah how are you going to test it you know but when the word is testable hold a man Noah was born in a scientific

the Prophet hallelujah I God the spirit had anointed the word I'm going to arc certainly stepped in and God close the door and rims hallelujah had certainly did and it destroyed that I'm to do living world but God always does it that way I know it was a confirmed prophet of God and it's God's message of the hour and this is what I want you to get Prince God he was the gods message of the art he was a prophet and he had to believe it right in it no I hard to believe it hey man I wasn't that taking somebody else's you know right I'll pinion over he had to believe her he was a man I was the man I was there when God spoke to me and I believe that hallelujah and the people have to believe the message after have been confirmed plans with a minute so that's the way it always is amen no thank you I prison Lord so here we saw not the word came to the prophet a memon for full all righteousness and then we read that wonderful wonderful thing not the Spirit came to the word the sprint kin to the word praise God amen the holy sprit he said I saw the Spirit of God descending from heaven like a dog I'm didn't wait upon him i'm britta brown says and he was drooling in the wilderness I'm temptation I'm converted the wilderness immediately and we find him praying for the set so the word had come to the prophet and they're sprint iphone to the word I've you find him amen kicking the devil on and also co nguoi I starting this ministry event right for the SEC game in the spread of God had come upon him before his ministry so that's the reason you can see it's not mean it does the works but the father that dwelleth in many men died in Acts chapter 10 it says that God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost I'm with power and he went about doing good and healing all not gonna press I of the devil that is something that our ministers can do hallelujah person wants deliverance there is deliverance there I wouldn't care hallelujah hard the devil would be afflicting you today and you can believe it there's a prayer of faith running the second image yeah I mean that's the Lord older okay that's just going a little bit more a man so the Holy Ghost here anoints to hurt okay then you can't do that I suppose it would be a logical question what are you doing amen what are you doing the profits of the same yeah you see where does the word is it just floating the aether so we're there or what happens to the word a man what happens then I'm gonna tell you what happens then because jesus said and it is expedient that I go from you because if I do not go the comforter
