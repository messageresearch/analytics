[18:58] awakened the whole congregation cuz we
[19:01] were on the other side of the world
[19:02] about 12 hours y'all we're all sleeping
[19:04] so we were talking about you while you
[19:06] were sleeping but that's okay okay so we
[19:10] weren't I want to thank everybody for
[19:12] their support mostly your prayer and the
[19:15] gifts that you gave the monetary gifts I
[19:17] I did not come back with anything so it
[19:21] was used to forward the gospel to one
[19:28] brother that if you'll remember three
[19:30] years ago he and we'll do this next
[19:32] Sunday because I'm not gonna do it this
[19:33] Sunday but next Sunday I'll show you his
[19:35] picture he's built six message churches
[19:37] and all he needs is nails so we just
[19:39] give him all kind of money for kilos of
[19:43] nails that's all he needed since that's
[19:44] what he needed to build the churches
[19:46] with he they didn't have a nail gun he
[19:50] used the one God give him okay so he's
[19:53] built six churches now he's trying to
[19:54] build his own so we're thankful for that
[19:57] and he's real good brother so we left
[20:00] them money for that but I just want to
[20:02] tell you that real quick but thanks
[20:04] again for your support appreciate your
[20:05] prayers

[20:17] going to review a little bit today and
[20:19] then go a little bit further and then
[20:22] let's then next Sunday Lord with an O
[20:24] I'll give you a report we're trying to
[20:26] get to get the pictures ready and get a
[20:29] few videos snippets some of you some of

[20:41] those if you if you wish so revelation 6
[20:44] verse 12 let's pray before we get
[20:46] started
[20:47] wait a minute April 6 Bible study April
[20:50] the 13th we have our
[20:51] I'm giving you all of April here from
[20:53] Saturday Saturday the sixties Bible
[20:55] study 13th is the Spring Fling April the
[20:58] 24th is Easter oh did everybody read the
[21:02] paper this morning Trump did something
[21:05] he recognized Israel when they took over
[21:09] the Golan Heights back in the 67 war
[21:13] there was a few presidents that agreed
[21:16] that Israel should own them but all the
[21:18] past few presidents especially Obama he
[21:22] hated Israel but he did not recognize
[21:24] that well Trump came out today and said
[21:26] we recognize as the United States of
[21:28] America we recognize the Golan Heights
[21:32] as being part of Israel and the Golan
[21:35] Heights is part of Israel so we just
[21:37] thank God that everything's moving in
[21:39] the right way we know we know what's
[21:41] gonna what's gonna happen and it's
[21:43] moving in the right direction that was
[21:46] one of the most asked questions besides
[21:49] Bible questions in the Philippines
[21:50] people asked me said what you think
[21:52] about Trump I said well he's the man we
[21:54] voted in so I guess he's the one who
[21:56] gonna get us out of here
[21:57] so you know what that's okay with me I
[21:59] really don't I told him I said I really
[22:01] don't care I really don't care but still
[22:04] he's in there you know and he's little
[22:07] pieces of thing he's president I believe
[22:08] does little pieces of thing that God
[22:10] puts them in there for Trump's real
[22:13] strong in the military so we've got to
[22:14] be a military might to be able to speak
[22:16] for the beast and everybody knows that
[22:17] that the you know the prophet of God
[22:19] told us United States would had to be
[22:21] have would be the voice are the power
[22:24] behind the beast so we have to be backup
[22:27] into into political power and into into
[22:32] military power so we thank God that we
[22:36] read the newspaper a long time ago
[22:39] through a prophet
[22:40] he told us exactly what was gonna happen
[22:42] so we're not surprised we know we they
[22:45] may not have been names put in there but
[22:47] that we know that the system is going to
[22:50] take us down it's going to go speak for
[22:53] the Beast the Beast is gonna come in and
[22:54] pay everything off and everything is
[22:56] gonna be really happy except for us when
[22:58] we were talking you know last time about
[22:59] persecution and that's when I believe
[23:02] that they're gonna tell us say hey you
[23:04] either believe this or you shut
[23:05] door you either believe this or you
[23:07] don't even get to go to the grocery
[23:08] store you know
[23:09] so one but you know what that's okay
[23:13] how in the world like brother Dale said
[23:16] how in the world are we going to not
[23:18] trust a God that stood there one day and
[23:20] said let there be in this all this
[23:21] stolen kiss came to being and we can't
[23:24] trust him to take care of his own kids
[23:25] no I trust him completely to take care
[23:28] of all our needs he knows the end from
[23:31] the beginning he knows what's gonna
[23:33] happen he knows it already so and he
[23:36] we're in this part of that that where
[23:38] God's opened the word so that we can see
[23:41] these things and see them plainly not to
[23:43] look to a glass darkly so we thank God
[23:45] for those things so let's bow our heads
[23:47] Heavenly Father we thank you today Lord
[23:49] that you've given us already a good day
[23:52] Lord it was good weather and good
[23:55] fellowship and friendship song service
[23:58] and everything else Lord we pray now
[23:59] that you just take active participation
[24:02] in this part of the service Lord of it
[24:04] that we've come to now that without you
[24:07] Lord with just a meeting of minds but
[24:09] with you Lord we we know that one thing
[24:12] for sure we will make a mistake as human
[24:14] beings but you have never in your
[24:16] eternal existence that ever committed a
[24:18] mistake so father we lay all these
[24:20] things in your hands Lord that you would
[24:22] take care of us be with the ones that
[24:24] are sick we were the ones that are not
[24:26] with us today for whatever reason Lord
[24:28] just bless each one Lord is on highways
[24:31] traveling on vacation and different
[24:33] things thank you lord basically for
[24:35] getting brother John and sister Alicia
[24:36] and the children back safe Lord and
[24:38] ourselves we thank you for those things
[24:40] Lord many things could happen there's a
[24:42] lot of things goes on when you travel
[24:44] but Lord you're the one that's got it
[24:46] all in your hand and in your control
[24:48] Lord we pray that you'd just be with us
[24:50] now take care of us bless us in Jesus
[24:53] name Amen
[24:54] 60o part a our review and I'll beheld
[24:58] when he had opened the sixth seal and lo
[24:59] there was a great earthquake and sun
[25:00] became black as sackcloth of hair and
[25:02] the moon became as blood the stars of
[25:04] heaven fell unto the earth even as a fig
[25:06] tree casteth her untimely figs when she
[25:08] is shaken of a mighty wind and the
[25:11] heaven departed as a scroll when it is
[25:13] rolled together and every mountain and
[25:15] Island were moved out of their places
[25:17] and the kings of the earth and the great
[25:19] the rich man the chief captain than the
[25:21] mighty men and every bondman and every
[25:22] free man hid himself in the dens and in
[25:25] the rocks of the mountains you don't
[25:26] thank God none of that I just read
[25:28] included you none of that none of that
[25:32] included you we're gone over in another
[25:34] dimension and we're not part of this but
[25:39] we know what's going to happen and we
[25:41] see what's gonna happen and that way God
[25:42] can show us that hey maybe we we need to
[25:45] work on ourselves to make sure we don't
[25:47] get included in this scripture here and
[25:50] said to the mountains and rocks fall on
[25:52] us and hide us from the face of him that
[25:54] sitteth on the throne and from the wrath
[25:56] of the lamb for the great day of his
[25:58] wrath has come and who shall be able to
[26:01] stand well there's no one gonna be able
[26:03] to stand in front of all that so you may
[26:05] be seated in Lord adders blessing
[26:06] reading the word no we were talking
[26:08] about last Sunday or Wednesday before we
[26:12] left about the persecution and how we
[26:15] would not go through the wrath of God
[26:17] tribulation but this sick seal is the
[26:20] tribulation seal now we must see as we
[26:23] read the first quote today on the sixth
[26:27] seal the first quote says this sixth
[26:29] seal is the tribulation period that's
[26:32] what takes place the bride has gone I'm
[26:34] telling you I every time I read this I
[26:37] really rejoice in myself that I know
[26:40] that a prophet told me that if I got the
[26:43] baptism of the Holy Ghost and believed
[26:47] on the Lord Jesus Christ and what he
[26:50] said in the Bible I do not have to go to
[26:53] tribulation Amen because like I've said
[26:55] before and I want you to just ask
[26:57] somebody in the denominational world
[26:59] they'll tell you they are expecting to
[27:03] go through some sort of tribulation Eve
[27:07] whether it be three and a half years
[27:08] whether it be seven years but everybody
[27:10] is expecting to go through all that
[27:14] wrath that we're talking about but you
[27:15] know well that's one thing that God
[27:18] taught us through a prophet that the
[27:20] Bible never said that the Bible never
[27:23] said the bride was going through the
[27:24] tribulation
[27:27] thank God it took a profit to separate
[27:31] that to bring a bride into view to bring
[27:34] a church into view to bring foolish
[27:36] virgins interview and to separate them
[27:38] by the Word of God he separated those
[27:40] groups out so that we can see this one
[27:42] doesn't go through this this one does go
[27:44] through that and the reasons why because
[27:46] the reason why we don't go through the
[27:48] tribulation period is we have received
[27:50] Christ who's already went through the
[27:52] tribulation period and then he took our
[27:54] wrath upon him courting Isaiah 53 that
[27:57] he would bore our iniquity he bore all
[28:00] of our sin he bore everything for us so
[28:03] that we can see that not only during you
[28:06] know even in baby form justification you
[28:09] do see that God done a work in your life
[28:10] he he forgive you about your past sins
[28:13] what a great thing but remember you kept
[28:16] on sinning and you kept on doing the
[28:18] things that you were doing because hey
[28:19] girls just keep movin on up just keep
[28:22] doing this playing for we're good to see
[28:25] you with us today but we see that those
[28:28] things are separated though that the
[28:30] bride doesn't have to go through that so
[28:32] we can take us completely out of any
[28:34] equation of even it says here it says
[28:37] and said to the mountains and rocks fall
[28:39] on us that us is not us
[28:41] that is another group of people that's
[28:44] not received God there's not received
[28:47] what the grace or the justification the
[28:51] real justification the one to where the
[28:53] real you never did it amen we're going
[28:55] to try to speak on that just for a
[28:56] second to try to bring everybody back up
[28:58] to speed and thank God brother brother
[29:01] Bob where's my bucket he's in the back
[29:04] he did a good job that Wednesday night
[29:06] baby I'm telling you he did a good job
[29:08] he did a real good job on hitting on
[29:11] those feast days because I'm gonna hit
[29:12] on them a little bit today and show you
[29:15] how that they were separated out but and
[29:17] it does can go into this thick steel
[29:20] because remember all trumpets sound
[29:24] under the sixth seal and then those
[29:25] feast days are in that sixth seal the
[29:27] day of atonement the day of the Feast of
[29:29] Tabernacles the feast the Feast of
[29:31] Trumpets that all that's the Israel but
[29:33] you and I get the spiritual application
[29:35] to that alright so same thing with this
[29:37] sixth seal we get the spiritual
[29:39] application
[29:39] of everything that's going on in this
[29:42] sixth seal where we see that everything
[29:44] every part of nature I want you to think
[29:47] as we go along because what happens is
[29:50] we're going to suffer some part of
[29:53] persecution but persecution and
[29:55] tribulation are two different things
[29:57] tribulation prophet of God said was the
[30:01] wrath of God
[30:02] now that wrath of God was already poured
[30:04] out on Christ on the cross it was all
[30:08] laid on him and he took it all and when
[30:10] he took it he didn't just hide it he did
[30:12] away with it that's why the prophet of
[30:15] God said never forget what happened at
[30:16] the cross because at that cross
[30:18] everything that you need even we were
[30:21] talking about this morning in the Bible
[30:23] study or in a Sunday School class your
[30:25] body when Jesus stepped out of that tomb
[30:28] and said all power in heaven has been
[30:29] given unto me and he was changed back to
[30:30] a twenty year old man potentially you
[30:32] were changed with him potentially all
[30:35] 2,000 years of church age members were
[30:38] changed at that moment because we have
[30:40] to look back to that son of man to get
[30:44] our body change so that's where it had
[30:46] to come from it originates that I know
[30:48] if Christ came out of a tomb with a
[30:50] glorified body that whoever is in the
[30:52] grave is gonna come out of the tomb with
[30:53] a glorified body and then we which are
[30:55] alive and remain to be changed in a
[30:58] moment in twenty number nine amen all
[31:00] right so this six seal then those
[31:02] separate to me it separates everything
[31:04] out and we were talking last time I
[31:08] spoke against that this was in a
[31:09] three-fold manner we'll get into that in
[31:11] just a second because thank God that
[31:13] brother Branham was so gracious that God
[31:16] brought him to me and you to bring these
[31:19] things and like I said it's that the the
[31:21] word separated everything out where he
[31:24] could put the pieces together and he
[31:25] could make where to me it's a plain
[31:27] picture it's a plain picture everybody
[31:30] thinks the seals and all these things
[31:32] are so deep and so mysterious it's the
[31:35] plan of redemption it's how you got from
[31:37] zero to a hero a man that's just the
[31:41] plan of redemption it's not some I mean
[31:45] it's all in the Bible there's not a
[31:48] different Bible we got to read brother
[31:50] Brown it bring us another Bible to have
[31:52] to read it's
[31:53] same Bible the same Bible that everybody
[31:56] reads we read it but we read it with the
[31:58] eyes of understanding that God has
[32:01] brought us in this endtime me and you us
[32:05] that's us we're the ones were the
[32:07] recipients of this alright so now let's
[32:10] read finish this quote that's what takes
[32:13] place the Brian has gone there's no
[32:14] living creature nothing there to say it
[32:16] in other words the Holy Ghost has left
[32:18] the building the Holy Ghost has left the
[32:20] earth it's only in two prophets then
[32:22] 144,000 over there and Israel it's not
[32:24] all around worldwide we're already gone
[32:27] all everybody around the world the
[32:28] Brian's already left the earth we're
[32:30] there's no Holy Ghost left they said
[32:31] what goes to those Jews over into Israel
[32:34] they're by all right with that God is
[32:37] not dealing with the church no more it's
[32:38] been it's been gone he's dealing with
[32:40] Israel this is the other side this is
[32:42] when Israel receives the message of the
[32:44] kingdom by the two prophets and we know
[32:47] they come in during this time of the
[32:49] Tribulation Period remember Israel is a
[32:51] nation God's servant nation and when
[32:53] Israel is brought in it'll be a national
[32:56] affair Israel the kingdom ages where
[32:58] David the son of David sits on a throne
[33:00] so Israel has to have their that's why I
[33:03] was so when I was reading that this
[33:04] morning I was rejoicing that they're
[33:07] getting their land back even Palestine
[33:09] Palestine is theirs but Palestine has
[33:13] kind of separated their self off but one
[33:15] day all that's got to come together
[33:16] because that's the Land of Israel
[33:17] they've got to be in their homeland to
[33:20] be able to receive the message alright
[33:22] so we see that they're getting bits and
[33:24] pieces back no I don't we that they came
[33:26] back mama they came back in the wind
[33:29] brother Brown tells 50s and 60s they
[33:30] started flying back in saying that this
[33:33] is our land but they only have a little
[33:35] bitty spot because by that time this one
[33:37] had to own this one and this one it
[33:39] tried to own this one the Palestinians
[33:40] own this over just a little bitty piece
[33:42] that's why the six-day war in 1967 was
[33:45] so important where they started getting
[33:47] some of their land back that was theirs
[33:49] because all the other nations had
[33:51] squeezed down trying to scale listen
[33:53] they want Israel gone the whole world
[33:56] basically wants Israel completely wiped
[33:59] off the map and they think that'll
[34:00] solved their problem we know that's for
[34:03] sure it will not solve their problem
[34:04] it'll just make it worse all right so
[34:07] let's
[34:07] number two here quote we'll get through
[34:09] this review a little bit and then we'll
[34:12] make some comments at the end try not to
[34:14] hold you too much today
[34:17] y'all be proud of me I didn't I don't
[34:19] think I preached over an hour and ten
[34:21] minutes over there in the Philippines so
[34:23] it can be done for we know that okay
[34:29] where we know that the sixth seal is the
[34:31] judgement seal I was telling him
[34:33] downstairs I bet you when I was over
[34:35] there I didn't read four quotes the
[34:36] whole time I was over in the Philippines
[34:39] no I think I read four quotes the rest
[34:42] was Bible and I would quote what brother
[34:44] Brown said but the people or the people
[34:46] are picking up the people are
[34:48] understanding more now that it's not
[34:51] just quotes cuz they're fighting they're
[34:52] they're fighting I'll tell you something
[34:54] next Sunday they're fighting Fox
[34:55] doctrine just like we are the only
[34:57] problem with it I told them I said I
[34:58] apologized as an American because all
[35:00] you two sold to Lord's seven thunders 14
[35:04] sales all come from America it all
[35:07] originated over here this great country
[35:09] that we've got all the prophets message
[35:11] and we've got all this ready available
[35:12] information that has got into the minds
[35:16] of a lot of message preachers and
[35:19] they've took it over there and and and
[35:22] of course they're fighting it because
[35:24] they have the Holy Ghost like we did
[35:25] they have the Holy Ghost just like we do
[35:27] in there they're doing a real good job
[35:29] of it I was really impressed with a lot
[35:31] of them in their reception of the words
[35:34] so it was really wonderful but we know
[35:36] that this sixth seal is the judgment
[35:38] seal it is the judgment seal exactly
[35:41] what it is now see we've had the
[35:43] Antichrist right seeing the church go
[35:44] now it's finished goes up then we see
[35:46] the martyrs of them Jews back there
[35:48] under the altar now here's the breaking
[35:50] fourth of the judgment upon the people
[35:51] we're out of this tribulation judgment
[35:54] will come forth 144,000 redeem Jews I'll
[35:57] prove it to you they're Jews and we know
[35:59] they are they have nothing to do with
[36:00] the bride and not a thing see there was
[36:04] I caught her brother royal for a few
[36:06] minutes they was also something going on
[36:09] in Philippines that had come from the
[36:10] United States that somebody from the
[36:12] United States was gonna go be one of
[36:14] them two prophets and they were gonna
[36:15] try to go over there and be you know
[36:17] take the message to the I said no
[36:19] brother
[36:20] said it was to Jews so it's to Jews
[36:23] weird listen weird dogs to Israel I
[36:27] don't carefully they shake hands with
[36:28] Trump Netanyahu's going
[36:30] he's a Gentile we'll just smile and
[36:34] shake his hand cuz he's a dog cuz we're
[36:37] just all dogs according to his rule
[36:39] we're just we're all Gentiles you know
[36:41] which is fine with me that's okay
[36:43] because remember Gentile lady looked up
[36:45] at the Lord one day and said Lord cannot
[36:48] this dog have crumbs from the master's
[36:51] table so I believe we got the crumbs
[36:52] from the master's table and we're able
[36:55] to to feast on that so if this is just
[36:57] crumbs just way too what's going on when
[36:59] we get over there if this is just crumbs
[37:01] oh my what a feast Amen they want
[37:06] nothing to do with the bride not a thing
[37:07] you see that they have nothing to do
[37:09] with the bride not a thing so the bride
[37:11] has nothing to do with Israel Israel has
[37:13] nothing to do with the bride when you
[37:15] when you go into this context the sixth
[37:17] seal separates and shows that we don't
[37:19] go to Israel and I don't know that you
[37:23] can say you can sit here and debate all
[37:25] day whether whether the two prophets
[37:27] take the seal book over to the Israel or
[37:29] taste the church age book to Israel but
[37:32] they will preach the message of the hour
[37:33] and they won't have to say brother
[37:36] Branham said My heavens they're two
[37:38] prophets they're self they're moses and
[37:39] elijah the spirit of moses and elijah so
[37:42] it's not going to be that they're gonna
[37:43] be over there quote quote israel's not
[37:46] going to take quotes they're gonna want
[37:48] to see something live something alive in
[37:51] those two prophets amen
[37:53] so we just don't need to spend a lot of
[37:56] time on whether they were this or that
[37:57] or the other because we're gonna be gone
[37:59] we're gonna be enjoying a wedding supper
[38:03] that we're going to not be in this
[38:05] dimension and we're not gonna worry
[38:07] about it but we do have to take this
[38:09] sick seal though and continue to go over
[38:12] it because see this seal if you've
[38:14] caught it we'll talk about it at the end
[38:15] this seal is a sanctification seal even
[38:19] though it being the tribulation what
[38:21] does it do it cleanses three groups of
[38:24] people
[38:24] well now the hidden mystery is is that
[38:26] it cleans one group of the without the
[38:29] three it cleans one group that I'm
[38:32] looking at now before any of this can
[38:33] ever take place
[38:34] amen so you and I have to go to a sick
[38:38] Seal purging to purge this we'll get
[38:41] into letting him got into that yeah
[38:43] we're just trying to stay on the natural
[38:44] seal and what that natural seal does to
[38:47] this earth because it does it to three
[38:50] different sets of people
[38:51] all right so we'll read it in just a
[38:53] second so the sixth seal is the judgment
[38:55] seal of the word so when you read the
[38:58] sixth seal you must see judgment but you
[39:01] almost all should always see
[39:03] sanctification all right number three
[39:08] let's read this real quick get some of
[39:10] these and some of these quote sounds now
[39:16] we're into the age of the eagle the
[39:18] revelation to be revealed the whole
[39:20] thing now compare this with revelations
[39:21] 10 verse 1 to 7 and we'll see in here in
[39:24] this revelations here 10 1 through 7 in
[39:26] the days of the sounding of the seventh
[39:28] angels message was to finish up all the
[39:30] mysteries of God now we find out also in
[39:33] this that the sixth seal now being
[39:35] opened it was for a three-fold purpose
[39:38] now here was the purpose the first thing
[39:41] was that the sleeping virgins had to go
[39:43] through the tribulation for what for
[39:46] purification which is sanctification
[39:50] sanctification is what cleaned and set
[39:52] aside for service now remember they
[39:55] can't be put in service or they would be
[39:57] bribed you and I are justified
[40:02] sanctified filled with the Holy Ghost we
[40:04] justified God picks up the glass
[40:06] sanctification he cleans the glass the
[40:09] baptism the Holy Ghost he uses the glass
[40:11] fills it up and uses the glass we'll see
[40:14] that's where those foolish virgin didn't
[40:15] get to that point they got to the point
[40:17] of God picking them remember the remnant
[40:20] we've come back a remnant of Israel
[40:23] being the remnant of the same cloth that
[40:25] you and I are cut out of all right but
[40:27] they don't get the Holy Ghost the the
[40:30] foolish virgin doesn't the foolish
[40:31] virgin gets a sanctification but they
[40:34] have to get it through the tribulation
[40:36] period right here all right there buddy
[40:38] got that say man now here was the
[40:42] purpose the first thing was that the
[40:43] sleeping virgins had to go through the
[40:45] tribulation period for purification she
[40:48] to be purse of her sins of unbelief and
[40:50] rejecting the message this she was done
[40:53] in the tribulation period we see they
[40:55] wind up over here in Revelation 7
[40:57] between 6th and 7th chapter that she had
[41:00] been purged and she had been given her
[41:01] robes now she's not the bride
[41:04] but it's the church they're pure people
[41:06] that didn't have the opportunity maybe
[41:08] to receive the message or in some way
[41:09] that they were blinded by these false
[41:12] prophets just like I was saying a minute
[41:14] ago and they didn't get a chance yet
[41:16] they're really sincere in heart in other
[41:18] words they're sincere they went through
[41:21] justification and went through
[41:22] sanctification and know God knows their
[41:24] heart and here's their purge during this
[41:27] time you notice that another purging
[41:30] time it's for Israel when she gathers
[41:31] that's the second fold now let's see
[41:34] under the second fold what is it it's
[41:36] during the Tribulation Period why does
[41:37] he purge them during the Tribulation
[41:39] Period because they turned him down
[41:41] in AD 30 let his blood be on us and our
[41:45] children that's what they're having to
[41:46] pay for now the 144,000 is going to
[41:49] receive the Holy Ghost but they're gonna
[41:51] have to pay for all that back part that
[41:54] came up from let his blood be on us and
[41:56] our children because that's what brother
[41:57] Bram talks about when we were typing the
[41:59] other day with the six fold purpose the
[42:02] six fold purpose is what make an end of
[42:04] sin reconciliation for iniquity and all
[42:06] those things that was bringing doing
[42:08] away with Israel's past because they
[42:11] rejected the Messiah see we accepted the
[42:13] Messiah they haven't accepted this
[42:16] Messiah they're waiting on to accept the
[42:20] Messiah but they're going to do it on
[42:21] their Day of Atonement not on their day
[42:25] of Pentecost Israel has not had their
[42:28] Pentecostal feast yet Israel the 144,000
[42:32] they've never had it before you and I
[42:34] had our Pentecost feast the day that we
[42:36] came right here not a day in the on the
[42:39] calendar but the day you received the
[42:41] Holy Ghost you began your Pentecostal
[42:43] feast and then and you've been in that
[42:46] Pentecostal feast like baubles come back
[42:48] for the whole seven church ages we've
[42:50] been in a Pentecostal feast all right
[42:53] and that's your first four feast and
[42:57] then you've got three more later on but
[43:00] we'll get to that in just a sec
[43:01] that's the second folk god purges Israel
[43:04] in the Tribulation Period out of the
[43:06] millions that will gather there there'll
[43:08] be a select 144,000 and they'll be
[43:11] purged also because remember they got to
[43:13] be killed they have to be killed the two
[43:16] prophets and 144,000 have to be killed
[43:19] God's purging Israel now there is a
[43:22] whole earth to be purged
[43:24] now it's brother Dale talked about the
[43:25] other day when either when you read the
[43:27] future home see he bring remember when
[43:29] you read that future home you're looking
[43:31] at the sixth seal because you're looking
[43:34] brother branham takes them from coming
[43:36] out of the Tribulation Period into the
[43:38] millennium into the future home all
[43:40] right so - that all begins with this
[43:42] sixth seal purging of the earth because
[43:46] there is a whole earth to be purged
[43:47] finish the reading here there will be
[43:50] such a thing that the moon stars and all
[43:52] nature will be purged you see what it is
[43:54] the earth is renewing herself being
[43:56] purged getting ready for the Millennium
[43:59] the millenniums coming up and see
[44:01] everything that's got any filth in it is
[44:03] to be purged during the sixth seal so
[44:07] now if the earth has to be purged and
[44:09] all the fields has to be purged during
[44:11] the sixth seal that has to happen to a
[44:13] group of people before any of these
[44:15] three can happen it's got to happen to
[44:17] us because the sixth seal must open to
[44:19] you and I in a spiritual form to show
[44:22] that our nature now we know our nature
[44:24] was changed when we received the baptism
[44:25] of Holy Ghost amen
[44:27] God interrupted our nature because that
[44:30] old nature that we had is dead like we
[44:32] were talking another day about you know
[44:34] the things I used to do I do them no
[44:36] more but the things I did when I did
[44:37] them I did them I did them and didn't
[44:41] bother me one bit there was no
[44:42] condemnation but now you know you you
[44:47] don't even hey that's what I was telling
[44:48] them I'll tell you this little story for
[44:51] just a second I won't have to tell it
[44:52] next Sunday I the last motel they put me
[44:56] up in was in the casino literally in a
[45:01] casino so but brother Vernon had set up
[45:05] all the security so he knew everybody
[45:07] man I thought I was they thought I was
[45:09] president they had to they had to FBI
[45:11] agent looking guys with him things
[45:13] sticking in their ears
[45:14] they escorted me out of a car they
[45:16] escorted me up to the up to the desk
[45:18] they escorted me up to the room and
[45:20] stood both by the doors till I put all
[45:21] my stuff in and then they left and then
[45:23] they come back picked me up and took me
[45:24] for supper
[45:24] so I guess everybody thought I was to be
[45:26] up here but I told them I said you know
[45:28] you see that and you it's just it's just
[45:30] it it humanly it draws you to it because
[45:35] you think man there's money in there and
[45:37] they're having fun you understand what
[45:39] I'm saying just humanely you look at
[45:40] that I told him I submitted I said if I
[45:43] just took one peso which is worthless in
[45:45] the United States one peso and put it in
[45:48] a machine I'd win ten minute not win ten
[45:50] million dollars and everybody ain't know
[45:52] it but now I would do that if I weren't
[45:56] a Christian not just because man the
[45:58] place was full of people that were in
[46:00] there playing you know so it didn't
[46:01] bother them what I'm saying is that old
[46:03] nature they were born with that they
[46:05] have nurtured all through their life it
[46:07] didn't bother them one bit to walk in
[46:09] and they were putting hundreds of pesos
[46:12] in those things pulling the machines and
[46:13] having all kind of fun but you know what
[46:15] that's what they fed on and I know you
[46:17] think about that you gonna boy you were
[46:19] in a bad situation no I thought it was
[46:20] pretty neat that I could stand there and
[46:22] have no no I didn't even want I no
[46:26] desire I was just saying it'd be my luck
[46:29] if I just win and put one little peso in
[46:31] you know and you'd win all this money
[46:33] but you know I never did I could have
[46:37] y'all would have never knew it I had the
[46:42] two security guys that they could have
[46:43] cleared the building for me but the
[46:52] desire was gone the desire of all the
[46:55] things that we used to do you know
[46:56] they're gone so that's where God started
[46:57] purging you from the inside out but
[47:00] there has to be a sixth seal purging
[47:02] though that comes to the outside guy and
[47:04] we'll talk to talk about it a little bit
[47:05] later but the earth listen if the earth
[47:07] has got to be purged then you and I have
[47:09] got to be purged first our purging
[47:12] because this six sealed once you see
[47:19] this six seal and how that it opens
[47:21] you'll know that you were purged you'll
[47:25] know when the sixth seal opens on this
[47:27] earth you have
[47:28] been purged and you are in another
[47:30] dimension in a glorified body and never
[47:34] to have to die again or never have to
[47:36] have any trouble you're in a protected
[47:38] place so when you see these things
[47:40] happening know one thing's for sure
[47:42] you're in a place that you are totally
[47:45] eternal body spirit and soul are you all
[47:50] wait today nobody's even saying Amen I
[47:53] listen I just came back from Philippines
[47:55] I need some reaction because they sure
[47:57] did I guess it doesn't mean as much to
[48:01] you as it does to them but this whole
[48:05] earth is purged there'll be such a thing
[48:06] that the moon the stars in nature will
[48:08] be too peepers you see what it is the
[48:11] earth is renewing itself and that's what
[48:13] God is doing because remember the fall
[48:15] caused all this but the renewing is
[48:18] coming but listen the renewing is not
[48:20] coming in rocks and bricks and moons and
[48:22] stars it's coming to me and you that's
[48:25] where the rest where the restoration is
[48:27] coming back it's coming back inside of a
[48:30] group of people whether you believe it
[48:33] or not somebody's gonna believe it and
[48:35] they're gonna be changed let's go to 2nd
[48:43] Timothy 3 but thou has fully known my
[48:47] doctrine manner of life purpose faith
[48:49] long-suffering charity patience
[48:51] persecutions afflictions which came into
[48:53] me at Antioch you see what Paul is
[48:55] telling you Paul's telling you he's went
[48:56] through a a certain kind of tribulation
[48:58] I mean my who has been how many times
[49:02] was he whipped
[49:04] several times at least 39 stripes minus
[49:06] one because 40 they say you die he's
[49:09] been whipped so many times his back had
[49:11] sores on top of stores but persecution
[49:14] afflictions which came into me in
[49:15] Antioch Iconium Lystra what persecutions
[49:17] I endured but out of them all the Lord
[49:20] delivered me yea and all that will live
[49:22] godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer
[49:24] persecution don't worry it will come of
[49:28] its own accord you will not have to hunt
[49:31] persecution it will come but the
[49:35] property God told us that the bride does
[49:38] better under persecution why because
[49:40] like now
[49:41] we're full bellies we got plenty of
[49:43] money we got food we got what we need
[49:48] God for what we need God for Matthew 13
[49:58] but he that receiveth seed in stony
[50:01] places the same is he that heareth the
[50:03] word and anon with joy receiveth how
[50:06] many times have you seen this yet hath
[50:08] not yet hath he not root in himself but
[50:12] dureth are endure for a while you see
[50:15] them they come and they endure for a
[50:16] little while but when tribulation or
[50:18] persecution arises because of the word
[50:21] because of the word by and by is
[50:24] offended they they leave they leave the
[50:30] church or leave the message or leave
[50:32] whatever you want to say they come to a
[50:34] place that went a little bit of
[50:35] tribulation because listen what
[50:37] tribulation and persecution you and I
[50:39] guess supposed to draw us closer to God
[50:41] it will never now if you're a bride it
[50:45] will never take you away from God
[50:47] persecution and tribulation will only
[50:50] drive you closer to Christ it will not
[50:53] if it draws you away if you think oh I'm
[50:56] going through persecution so I'll leave
[50:58] the church or I'm going through
[51:00] persecution I'll just that's not God
[51:04] that's you doing that but when we
[51:08] tighten up our belt and we come together
[51:10] and say hey let's get rid of this and we
[51:12] maybe we've been doing a little too much
[51:14] of this so we've not done a lot of that
[51:15] or we've not prayed enough we've not
[51:18] read to buy no we I know we're all
[51:19] covered under that one we don't pray
[51:21] enough and we don't read her Bible
[51:22] enough but if we do that don't be like
[51:25] this person he had no root but endure it
[51:28] for a while but when tribulation and
[51:30] persecution arises because of the word
[51:32] by and by his offended something inside
[51:36] of him offends him or her and they leave
[51:40] well they really didn't have anything
[51:42] rooted and grounded to start with or
[51:44] they would say thank God for the
[51:46] persecution and thank God for the
[51:48] tribulation all right now not the
[51:50] tribulation period just tribulation that
[51:53] you and I have to go through
[51:55] Paul went through tribulation that's
[51:56] what he was talking about how'd you like
[52:00] to be strapped to a pole and take your
[52:02] shirt off and hit you 39 times with a
[52:04] whip 39 times with the whip I think you
[52:08] had that done two or three times in his
[52:10] life plus they threw things at it five
[52:12] times brother al said thank you where
[52:13] the hell you read the Bible more than I
[52:15] am and that's the trick I'm just being
[52:17] serious he knew what I was talking about
[52:18] they meant five times the man's back was
[52:23] just like hamburger meat but that was
[52:25] the tribulation and persecution he went
[52:27] through to get this gospel so that you
[52:29] and I can hear it so what are we doing
[52:31] to further that gospel we we don't have
[52:33] somebody whipping us oh yeah we have
[52:35] persecution but most of ours is
[52:37] spiritual persecution amen so we have to
[52:41] be careful with that
[52:43] Matthew 24:22 this is the seal for then
[52:47] shall be Great Tribulation such as not
[52:49] since the beginning of the world to this
[52:50] time nor ever shall be and except those
[52:53] days should be shortened there should be
[52:55] no flesh save for the elects sake those
[52:57] days shall be shortened and we know that
[52:59] they have been man have you always not
[53:01] realize when you get older the year a
[53:04] year only lasts about 20 days maybe 30
[53:10] Rebekah's over there going it was just
[53:12] taxis in a couple of weeks ago but
[53:15] really I mean you see the day's
[53:16] shortening the days are shortening in
[53:19] ourselves to where we we realize that
[53:22] God's doing something and I believe that
[53:24] what I was talking to him in some of
[53:27] them in the over season they see an
[53:30] urgency more than they used to be but
[53:32] it's just in a few it's not an urgency
[53:34] in an overall crowd it's just in a few
[53:37] people and you see that it just pops up
[53:39] in a few people that the days will be
[53:42] shortened we know something's coming and
[53:44] we know as the brides what we got to do
[53:46] to get to that place because brother
[53:48] Graham told us what to do to get to this
[53:50] place
[53:50] amen so getting to that place is not so
[53:53] bad it's just we've been here a long
[53:56] time and then not like I said before you
[53:58] know you I love that scripture those who
[53:59] endure to the end shall be saved so
[54:01] you've got to endure to the end not
[54:03] enduring inquit endure to the end I want
[54:07] to see this thing complete
[54:08] I want to see this thing finished mmm it
[54:17] may be horrible in one way but it's the
[54:18] most glorious thing that ever happened
[54:20] on the face of the earth is that a group
[54:22] of people comes to a body change that
[54:26] there is a resurrection of the Dead
[54:28] Saints from 2,000 years ago two thousand
[54:32] years of bride coming out of the grave
[54:36] and then we're going into rapture what a
[54:38] wonderful time except those days should
[54:41] be shortened there should be no flesh
[54:43] save for the elects sake those days
[54:44] shall be shortened then if any man shall
[54:47] say unto you lo here is Christ or there
[54:49] believe it not for there shall arise
[54:52] false Christ's and false prophets and
[54:55] shall show great signs and wonders so
[54:58] you can't put it all on that and so much
[55:00] that if it were possible they shall
[55:02] deceive the very elect behold I have
[55:06] told you before now what is this barely
[55:08] barely I say unto you behold I've told
[55:10] you before wherefore if you shall stand
[55:12] and if they shall say unto you behold he
[55:17] is in the desert go not forth behold he
[55:19] is in the secret chambers believe it not
[55:22] now how are you gonna know that cuz you
[55:27] know he's here you don't have to go to
[55:30] the desert to find Christ he's inside of
[55:31] you and if you know that you know that
[55:34] you know you can just stand right there
[55:35] because your roots are grounded in God
[55:37] amen and you don't go to and fro and
[55:40] that's for travel after every wind of
[55:42] doctrine that comes along because look
[55:44] wherefore if ye shall say unto you
[55:46] behold his in the desert go not forth
[55:48] behold he's in the secret chamber
[55:50] believe it not for as the Lightning
[55:52] cometh out of the east and shine it into
[55:54] the West so shall also the coming of the
[55:56] Son of man be so what is the coming son
[55:58] of man me and you are the coming of the
[55:59] Son of man so it says as the Lightning
[56:02] comes from the east to the west so shall
[56:05] the coming of the Son of man be for were
[56:07] so ever the carcass is there were the
[56:09] Eagles be gathered together and managed
[56:12] to what a promise now let's look at
[56:14] number four and get down to my to my
[56:18] point here and then we'll
[56:22] cut it off let's read them down and I'm
[56:26] so sorry really they I've held you like
[56:27] this this is Shalom 1964 but just to get
[56:31] a tape of this now when if the Lord
[56:33] willing this is one of them to speak at
[56:34] Phoenix Sunday then Monday I'm going a
[56:36] little short meeting so forth I purposed
[56:38] in my heart this year the Lord willing I
[56:40] just could tour from side to side see he
[56:43] had a lot tribulation in the South
[56:44] listen that guy was 56 years old when he
[56:46] died and he looked way older than 56
[56:48] years old because of the ministry that
[56:50] brother Branham had it really told on
[56:52] his body and we all know that's the
[56:54] identification we know what the third
[56:57] pole is we all understand that now you
[56:59] got you'll have the tape see and I think
[57:02] it'll just lay dormant for a little
[57:03] while until the great hour of
[57:05] persecution comes on that's when it be
[57:08] it will it'll speak it will be
[57:10] manifested just like the five straight
[57:12] signs without fail you're perfect now
[57:14] think just now think just wait see see -
[57:17] what what it's done now I'm going back
[57:19] the same again through and through to
[57:21] find out short the third pole we were
[57:24] talking about it last last week the
[57:25] third pole it is the opening of the word
[57:28] and it's not something when you say it
[57:30] you say well brother dealt with at least
[57:31] laying dormant then God's laid it upon
[57:33] the shelf somewhere no it's not in its
[57:35] full power yet because under the third
[57:39] pole ministry I was thinking about this
[57:40] this morning under the third pole
[57:42] ministry things were created not healed
[57:46] created from nothing like if you need
[57:50] gas like if you need oil there was
[57:53] nothing and then there's oil all in the
[57:55] car if you don't have anything to eat
[57:57] that will be food provided for you
[58:00] that's what the third pole is but it's
[58:02] not just the third pole that we're
[58:04] waiting on something to happen or or you
[58:06] know like most people to return ministry
[58:09] they're waiting on brother Branham come
[58:10] back to tell us we got the third pole
[58:11] well they'll be too late then way too
[58:15] late and then you'll be in that foolish
[58:18] virgin part that's gonna have to be
[58:20] purged in in the tribulation so you
[58:23] believe that whatever you want to or
[58:24] they don't bother me I'm just gonna be
[58:26] ready before I put all my dependency on
[58:29] what brother I'm said yes but I put on
[58:31] dependency that Jesus Christ is one it's
[58:33] gonna take us over
[58:34] he's one that done it for us and he's
[58:36] the one that's gonna take it to it all
[58:38] right he's the one that's gonna take it
[58:39] to us we know what the third Pole is and
[58:41] we are third pool people because third
[58:43] pole is the opening of the world we've
[58:44] got now the opening of the word of God
[58:47] more than any age since Jesus was
[58:51] standing here himself no one understood
[58:53] him while he was here but now by the
[58:55] grace of God if we had Jesus Christ
[58:59] standing here today speaking to us like
[59:01] he did 2000 years ago we could
[59:03] understand what he said that don't make
[59:07] you excited cuz you know what he was
[59:13] very lonesome because nobody understood
[59:16] him he said you don't understand me
[59:19] you don't understand my speech hear me
[59:22] listen to what I'm saying they didn't
[59:24] listen to nothing but now being under
[59:27] the ministry of the son of man we've got
[59:28] all the prophets every prophet lain
[59:30] another prophet to come to us not
[59:33] another prophet to come to the Gentiles
[59:35] we've had all of them the Bible has been
[59:37] open this is a sick sealed book that's
[59:39] been open the you and I can see this so
[59:42] yes if Christ was standing here today
[59:43] and speaking to us we could say Amen to
[59:45] every word every word it'd not be going
[59:49] without what are you talking about you
[59:51] know that's what this message is all
[59:53] about it restored back that same
[59:56] three-and-a-half-year message that
[59:58] Christ preached while he was on earth
[59:59] with no question he was not wrong never
[1:00:04] it was Jesus Christ wrong and what he
[1:00:05] said so if we can say Amen to it and
[1:00:09] make it live then that's the purpose
[1:00:11] Jesus came for so the third poll was
[1:00:19] labeled dormant for a little while so
[1:00:21] the great hour persecution comes on
[1:00:23] that's when it be it'll speak what's the
[1:00:27] it it'll speak it'll speak in me and you
[1:00:30] and then it'll speak through us it'll
[1:00:34] speak through the bride of Jesus Christ
[1:00:36] we've seen a lot of pieces and parts of
[1:00:39] it even through brother branham's and
[1:00:40] even through the ministry here in the
[1:00:42] church we've seen things being called
[1:00:43] and brought in but when
[1:00:47] full manifestation comes brother Brown
[1:00:50] said it's just gonna be like popcorn is
[1:00:51] just gonna be popcorn popping all right
[1:00:53] so that's what I'm looking toward but
[1:00:55] but that's not just a place that we got
[1:00:57] to get to we got to start now
[1:01:00] because the opening of the word just
[1:01:02] keeps going and it keeps going remember
[1:01:04] God never stops he keeps going and going
[1:01:06] all right now look at number five the
[1:01:08] northern ones to the M times 1965 now
[1:01:11] the very day when this messenger not
[1:01:13] when he starts on but when he begins to
[1:01:16] declare his message now watch brother
[1:01:18] I'm saying not when he first and brother
[1:01:20] Graham said many times not in the
[1:01:22] healing campaign that wasn't brother
[1:01:24] branham's message the healing campaign
[1:01:27] was not his message that was the bait on
[1:01:31] the hook to get the people to come to
[1:01:34] hear the message which started there in
[1:01:36] 63 in the seals or 62 63 not when he
[1:01:39] starts on but when he begins to declare
[1:01:42] his message see
[1:01:43] first Paul healing second Paul
[1:01:46] prophesying third pull the opening of
[1:01:50] the word the mysteries reveal no more
[1:01:53] there's no more higher order to reveal
[1:01:54] the word than prophets well folks we've
[1:01:57] had them we've had brought we've had
[1:02:00] them we're standing now in a prophetic
[1:02:03] age not being prophesying we're not
[1:02:07] under this prophesy in part
[1:02:08] we're under the opening of the word the
[1:02:11] mysteries revealed we had to go through
[1:02:13] the prophesied part where brother
[1:02:14] Branham would prophesy and he would tell
[1:02:16] us the things to come well those things
[1:02:18] are come they're happening now all right
[1:02:22] so the third pull open the other words
[1:02:24] mysteries revealing no more there's no
[1:02:26] more higher order revealed the words and
[1:02:27] prophets but the only way the Prophet
[1:02:29] can be vindicated is by the word and we
[1:02:31] know brother Branham was definitely a
[1:02:32] vindicated word prophet and the third
[1:02:36] poll was the opening of them seven seals
[1:02:42] to reveal the hidden truth and what was
[1:02:44] the hidden truth the hidden truth wasn't
[1:02:46] that the plow horse rider was Antichrist
[1:02:49] sure that was part of the mystery had to
[1:02:51] be made known but when that seal tore
[1:02:54] off brother Graham said the whole he
[1:02:56] didn't say revelations chapter 6 became
[1:02:58] a brand-new chapter
[1:03:00] he said the whole Bible became a brand
[1:03:03] new book he saw the seals from beginning
[1:03:05] to end he's and there's only one thing
[1:03:08] to see from beginning the end is the
[1:03:09] plan of redemption
[1:03:10] the Bible is the only book that shows
[1:03:13] the complete plan of redemption they men
[1:03:16] it is and it was sealed up with those
[1:03:21] seals until today all right so you and I
[1:03:24] get the complete listen we get
[1:03:27] everything and it's not coming it's here
[1:03:32] what we need for what we have of what we
[1:03:36] need is here now it's in two people it's
[1:03:41] not on a tape recorder it's in people
[1:03:45] God never wanted to be plastic he didn't
[1:03:51] he wanted to be flesh your flesh of my
[1:03:54] flesh he wants to work through our flesh
[1:03:59] to me folks that's the mystery the
[1:04:03] mystery the greatest mystery of God is
[1:04:05] that you and I have been plopped into
[1:04:08] the worst age on the since the beginning
[1:04:11] of time the worst age and where God made
[1:04:16] manifest in another form called the
[1:04:18] bride and we walk through this world a
[1:04:20] total mystery a mystery to the world
[1:04:24] mine can you imagine all the things that
[1:04:27] the world does that we don't do anymore
[1:04:30] that to them is just normal and it's
[1:04:34] becoming more and more normal to do the
[1:04:37] uh normal for the world but you and I
[1:04:42] are not part of that thank god we've
[1:04:44] been brought out of all that thank god
[1:04:46] we've been separated to where yes we
[1:04:49] walk right down through the smutty pits
[1:04:51] of hell every day and we're this chosen
[1:04:55] bride of Jesus Christ
[1:04:59] Aaron if I don't stir you you bow you
[1:05:03] what is it your spell by your bow that
[1:05:09] don't stir you up thank you it was
[1:05:12] something like that but really I mean if
[1:05:16] it don't stir your heart I was thinking
[1:05:20] coming by I guess it's coming back from
[1:05:22] the Philippines I can't remember how
[1:05:23] many flights I was on but that how you
[1:05:25] can there you are and it would not just
[1:05:27] be me if a brother John's sister Alicia
[1:05:30] and the children sitting on an airplane
[1:05:32] probably I say probably the only people
[1:05:35] that believed in God on the whole plane
[1:05:36] and to be the chosen bride of Jesus
[1:05:39] Christ and us just sitting there having
[1:05:41] a happy time and thinking about God and
[1:05:44] thinking about the things that we've
[1:05:45] done and then you know we're coming back
[1:05:47] home and and you know we running through
[1:05:50] the things our mind the things we wanted
[1:05:52] to do in the Philippines and the things
[1:05:54] we wanted to get accomplished and we're
[1:05:56] sitting on an airplane and we're flying
[1:05:58] it you know 600 miles an hour 35,000
[1:06:00] feet and that's what God chose God chose
[1:06:05] you to do what you do it shows me to do
[1:06:06] what I do but you know what he chose us
[1:06:08] to do that and here we are sitting on
[1:06:10] this airplane and you know what I'll
[1:06:12] guarantee you the devil wants to throw
[1:06:14] that thing into the ground because he
[1:06:16] definitely wants to get rid of us but
[1:06:19] when that thing comes around in taxis
[1:06:21] and I feel like power in that engine I'm
[1:06:23] thinking man get me home I always say
[1:06:29] God you be the pilot you be the mechanic
[1:06:32] and you be the wind underneath them
[1:06:34] wings and get me home he's never failed
[1:06:37] to get me home never has he failed to
[1:06:40] get me home hey man but see that's us
[1:06:43] and that's a mystery but now if I were
[1:06:45] to stand up in that plane and say hey
[1:06:47] y'all 300 people I'm God made manifest
[1:06:54] that work
[1:06:57] y'all would see me like this and I'd
[1:07:02] have the thing on the I mean really so
[1:07:06] your mystery in the world but you're
[1:07:08] telling the exact truth you stand up in
[1:07:10] the plane and say I am God made manifest
[1:07:12] in another form called the bride think
[1:07:18] about it think about all them healings
[1:07:21] and you know good people I'm not saying
[1:07:23] anything about it but I'm just saying
[1:07:24] they're not at the level of spiritual
[1:07:28] understanding that you're at they're
[1:07:31] just going through life I'm gonna die
[1:07:36] that and that's all they're doing i
[1:07:38] watch people I'm like sister Lisa's this
[1:07:41] place to have a good time in some of
[1:07:42] them airports don't use the people watch
[1:07:45] her but you watch people and you think
[1:07:48] where did they come from and they
[1:07:51] definitely don't know where they're
[1:07:52] going
[1:07:53] I mean you know me I saw this one
[1:07:57] somewhere but this girl had stuff she
[1:08:00] had so many holes in her body if if the
[1:08:03] wind blew she'd whistle like a wind
[1:08:04] chime I mean she had like here and here
[1:08:08] and here and here them great big old
[1:08:10] ring I mean really look at what their
[1:08:14] mentality is look what God took us from
[1:08:22] sitting there the other day getting gas
[1:08:24] at the door waiting on take Deana
[1:08:27] somewhere we were rabbit town and
[1:08:29] they're set to rabbit town liquor store
[1:08:30] and I'm sitting over looking at them
[1:08:32] people and they go in they buy their
[1:08:37] beer and they go put it in your car and
[1:08:40] you go home and you don't know what
[1:08:44] nowhere I mean they some cars you
[1:08:45] couldn't hardly the car couldn't hardly
[1:08:47] make it to the parking lot and then you
[1:08:50] had some Mercedes that were sitting
[1:08:51] there so it takes all Pete it takes out
[1:08:53] all the people the devil is the same
[1:08:55] devil he just gets to all of them but
[1:08:57] they all have the same purpose what I'm
[1:08:59] gonna go buy me some beer and I'm going
[1:09:00] to drink my sorrows away I'm gonna have
[1:09:02] a social drink you know I mean I have a
[1:09:05] social drink too every day
[1:09:08] I drink from a fountain that never will
[1:09:13] run dry and if you want to get drunk on
[1:09:15] this go ahead
[1:09:17] cuz I'll promise you when they give you
[1:09:19] a sobriety test out of a car
[1:09:21] you'll be drunk on the holy ghost but
[1:09:23] I'll guarantee you you'll pass the
[1:09:24] sobriety test
[1:09:25] the ones that the world gives amen but
[1:09:29] you see what we've been took from this
[1:09:30] sick seal takes us and purges us from
[1:09:33] all that stuff it takes care of that
[1:09:44] little man from Kentucky brought us a
[1:09:46] message and now you and I are the final
[1:09:49] voice to the final age under that
[1:09:52] message and it's gonna take us home it's
[1:09:57] gonna get us out of here let the world
[1:10:00] do what they do but you're walking
[1:10:03] through the world but you're not of the
[1:10:05] world like I said before all the great
[1:10:07] things that even when Jesus stood up he
[1:10:09] said I am the resurrection and the life
[1:10:10] well they want to kill him and they did
[1:10:12] you see what he said the many things he
[1:10:15] said upset the religion of the day and
[1:10:21] so will you and I if we have the same
[1:10:24] message of Jesus Christ the exact same
[1:10:26] things gonna happen you're gonna almost
[1:10:30] walk alone in this world that's why I
[1:10:33] love my church family your real family
[1:10:37] don't understand you but your church
[1:10:40] family understands you and it's an
[1:10:43] eternal family it's a family you're
[1:10:46] gonna live an eternity with all right
[1:10:50] everybody okay
[1:10:51] maybe you got woke up just to film a few
[1:10:54] minutes we'll close in just a second
[1:10:55] all right look right here let's go to
[1:10:57] the next one is we'll go to the seals
[1:10:59] now remember we went through the first
[1:11:02] four seals and the first four seals we
[1:11:05] type justification sanctification about
[1:11:07] ten and Holy Ghost and the opening of
[1:11:08] the word the four seals four first four
[1:11:11] seals then we show where five six and
[1:11:14] seven
[1:11:14] we know the fifth seal is to the Jew the
[1:11:17] six seals to the Jew and the seven seals
[1:11:19] to the Jew under that part you
[1:11:21] understand one
[1:11:21] under that part because the seventh seal
[1:11:24] to them is the same as the seventh
[1:11:26] trumpet to them the same as the seventh
[1:11:27] seal does alright so what happens is
[1:11:30] when when Israel receives their
[1:11:34] justification and sanctification because
[1:11:36] I believe they're gonna get the Holy
[1:11:37] Ghost like we did I think they're gonna
[1:11:38] have to go through justification
[1:11:39] sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:11:41] and then what's going to happen Christ
[1:11:43] is going to come on the scene the
[1:11:44] seventh seal is going to be revealed to
[1:11:46] them in a part you're what I said in a
[1:11:49] part like it is to us in a part because
[1:11:54] the seventh seal to me and you the true
[1:11:56] seventh seal to me and you is when we
[1:11:59] are changed without death when we're
[1:12:05] changed without seeing death that is the
[1:12:08] seventh seal opening to you and I now
[1:12:12] that there is a seventh seal opening
[1:12:14] because it is the Holy Ghost
[1:12:15] I put the Holy Ghost in fire because
[1:12:17] that's what it's got to be the fires got
[1:12:19] to burn everything out but that's what
[1:12:20] it's got to happen to Israel but now
[1:12:22] under our fifth seal we saw a group of
[1:12:25] people give an eternal life just because
[1:12:30] they were a certain group of people
[1:12:31] right they were Jews so somewhere they
[1:12:35] have to be in God's eyes they have to be
[1:12:38] justified because they're just going to
[1:12:41] be given he's heard of life they're not
[1:12:43] bribed they're not 244,000 but the fifth
[1:12:46] sealed Jew has got to come under such a
[1:12:49] justification that the real them didn't
[1:12:51] do it because God didn't hold anything
[1:12:53] if they're given white robes folks they
[1:12:56] can't be one spot against you so I want
[1:12:59] us to see that because this is God this
[1:13:01] is for our body change we've got to see
[1:13:04] we've got to we don't have to stand up
[1:13:07] in the middle of a plane but what if you
[1:13:08] stood up in the middle of a plane and
[1:13:10] say I'm perfect
[1:13:17] you would get one of them they'd
[1:13:23] probably want to throw you out the cargo
[1:13:24] hold I mean really stand up and say I'm
[1:13:29] perfect cuz what's the first thing a
[1:13:30] nominal person will tell you when you
[1:13:33] start talking about the Lord I'll
[1:13:34] promise you you can quote it like I'm
[1:13:37] quoting it well we're not all perfect
[1:13:38] and I look at them and I say that's not
[1:13:44] what God said what do you mean wait
[1:13:48] nobody perfect I said the Bible told me
[1:13:50] be therefore perfect and through his
[1:13:56] eyes I have to be perfect through God's
[1:14:00] eyes I am perfect I'm not going to be or
[1:14:04] I'm not born again if I'm born again in
[1:14:06] the eyes of God I'm perfect my sins and
[1:14:10] has not just been hid they've been put
[1:14:12] so far away he can't even remember amen
[1:14:16] so we got to deal them with
[1:14:19] justification being that the real you
[1:14:21] didn't do it we already covered this I'm
[1:14:23] just laughing back over to get into the
[1:14:26] sixth seal because this sixth seal is
[1:14:28] the seal of so much this is
[1:14:30] sanctification to its highest power
[1:14:33] remember God has cleaned the earth off
[1:14:35] in times of Noah with water but remember
[1:14:39] what step back on earth with him he
[1:14:42] began sinning again man began sinning
[1:14:45] again all the different things God has
[1:14:47] done wars have wiped people out
[1:14:50] different things man has tried to why
[1:14:52] Hitler tried to wipe the Jews out you've
[1:14:55] had you've had many purges of people
[1:14:57] trying to get this thing fixed back
[1:14:59] right
[1:15:00] don't tell Hitler what's worst man ever
[1:15:03] lived on the face of the earth I believe
[1:15:04] but still he was trying to do something
[1:15:06] he was trying to get rid of an inferior
[1:15:08] race to raise a better race didn't know
[1:15:13] what we're doing
[1:15:14] oh you know what we're doing we're
[1:15:19] getting rid of an inferior gene problem
[1:15:23] to bring in a better one
[1:15:26] hey man aren't you a better person
[1:15:27] because you're a Christian well the old
[1:15:30] you swap
[1:15:30] now listen there's no record of that
[1:15:33] there's no record no we're in heaven
[1:15:36] hell on earth of your past if you're
[1:15:39] truly born again there's no record
[1:15:43] so it has cleaned this race of people up
[1:15:46] listen there's not gonna be sinners in
[1:15:48] the new future home it's not gonna be
[1:15:53] what you know make the list they're not
[1:15:56] gonna be there so there has been a race
[1:16:00] cleansing but what Hitler done is he
[1:16:03] took it and perverted it because he
[1:16:05] wasn't a Christian number one number two
[1:16:07] he let the devil get on him and he tried
[1:16:09] to get rid of one certain race which we
[1:16:11] know that you know what that was the
[1:16:13] hand of God God already told him he was
[1:16:17] going to release those two hundred
[1:16:18] thousand thousand demons brother Brown
[1:16:19] said to drive Israel to their homeland
[1:16:23] just like he hardened Pharaoh's heart
[1:16:25] all these different things now God
[1:16:27] didn't make them do it I can't make them
[1:16:30] do anything but he allowed Hitler to do
[1:16:35] what he did to the Jews to drive them
[1:16:37] back to the homeland
[1:16:37] so God's allowing the devil to do what
[1:16:40] he's doing to me and you to drive us
[1:16:42] back to our homeland which is not a
[1:16:44] piece of property it's the Word of God
[1:16:46] hey ma'am it's just pretty simple but I
[1:16:53] wrote down here she is him
[1:16:58] now that's what we kind of the whole
[1:17:01] point we were when we're in the
[1:17:02] Philippines we stayed on the I am but we
[1:17:04] also stayed on the Shia's him whatever
[1:17:06] whatever he gets she gets Jesus Christ
[1:17:10] got a body changed we get a body changed
[1:17:12] amen all the different things that we
[1:17:15] see that that we're not that second
[1:17:17] person that that we've kind of not maybe
[1:17:20] a name we've said we were a second
[1:17:22] person but we've always maybe separated
[1:17:25] it but but watch what brother Branham
[1:17:27] says let's read this in the rising of
[1:17:30] the Sun so let's let's just run through
[1:17:32] real quick those fifth seal
[1:17:34] justification the real you never did it
[1:17:36] sixth seal sanctification
[1:17:38] now this sanctification when we come to
[1:17:40] this think the vacation going into the
[1:17:41] Millennium it's going to take the entire
[1:17:42] earth and clean it
[1:17:44] but now remember remember you got to
[1:17:46] leave a point there
[1:17:48] it will not clean it as it will before
[1:17:51] the future home the devil is going to
[1:17:54] still be here and so where is his little
[1:17:58] imps because remember the millennium is
[1:18:00] still in time he's not going to be able
[1:18:01] to work but he's still going to be here
[1:18:03] but now when we walk into that future
[1:18:05] home that is a total purging because
[1:18:08] remember the future home is a type of
[1:18:09] your body change the millenniums really
[1:18:13] not it's still in the seventh day it's
[1:18:17] typing your new birth yeah you're born
[1:18:19] to get in you're into the glorious time
[1:18:20] of your of your Christian experience but
[1:18:22] until you get in the future home in the
[1:18:24] eighth day we know that in our soul
[1:18:28] we're that but until we step into that
[1:18:30] future home there's always going to be
[1:18:33] something else but buddy when that
[1:18:34] future home because God's gonna clean
[1:18:36] this earth off with his fire before we
[1:18:40] go into the future home it will not be
[1:18:42] atomic fire like the Millennium where
[1:18:44] things will be left here no because
[1:18:47] remember we're gonna build things in the
[1:18:50] Millennium we're gonna build houses and
[1:18:52] inhabit them that's what the Bible says
[1:18:53] but now in the future home that that's
[1:18:56] already build that's that's an eternal
[1:18:58] place amen but now you got to back all
[1:19:02] that up 1,000 years and every what you
[1:19:04] want to and stand right here today and
[1:19:07] stand up in that airplane and say you
[1:19:10] remember that city that come down out of
[1:19:11] heaven in revelation 22 I'm that City
[1:19:17] they might throw you completely out of
[1:19:19] the airplane but you know what we're
[1:19:23] only saying what God said about us it
[1:19:26] may be strange to them and some of them
[1:19:28] probably don't even know what revelation
[1:19:29] 20-something 22 is but still that's what
[1:19:33] we are that's the recipients of this
[1:19:35] messages you know who you are and you
[1:19:38] know what you're doing here and you know
[1:19:41] where you're going so the Holy Ghost in
[1:19:44] fire that fire that burns us on the day
[1:19:46] that we receive a body change to me is
[1:19:49] that same fire that cleanses the earth
[1:19:51] before we walk into the millennium the
[1:19:54] end of the future home think about it
[1:19:58] because you got the baptism the Holy
[1:20:00] Ghost in your soul but you don't have it
[1:20:01] your spirit in your body at this point
[1:20:04] today but when you take a body change
[1:20:07] your whole being is eternal your whole
[1:20:10] being has been changed amen
[1:20:14] that's God's fire that's not any kind of
[1:20:17] atomic fire that man did that's the fire
[1:20:19] of God that's the Holy Ghost and fire
[1:20:21] that burns you out and changes your body
[1:20:24] because it's literally going to change
[1:20:26] this earth when we step on in future
[1:20:28] home everything is going to be right
[1:20:29] back up shape again everything is gonna
[1:20:31] be right where it needs to be and it's
[1:20:34] going to be perfect go see after that
[1:20:36] there's no more change when you're
[1:20:39] getting when you get in the future home
[1:20:40] there's no changing going on now in the
[1:20:42] Millennium there's changes
[1:20:44] there's things changing then you got a
[1:20:46] white throne judgment things change
[1:20:48] their eternal destinations are changed
[1:20:50] but when you get in the future home it's
[1:20:51] settled it's done there's no more
[1:20:55] changing or put you know well I'm gonna
[1:20:57] get a better house in Louisa's God you
[1:20:59] know I'm gonna get one higher up here
[1:21:01] you know you two better you're gonna
[1:21:03] live with him but really it's not it's
[1:21:10] all done but so that's what the Holy
[1:21:12] Ghost in fire does is make us him it's
[1:21:17] rising of the Sun let's read this that's
[1:21:19] what he proved hallelujah that's what
[1:21:23] Easter proved he wasn't only the word
[1:21:25] but he was God himself the dynamics in
[1:21:28] the word that made the body of Jesus
[1:21:31] Christ look cold stiff and dead in the
[1:21:35] grave Jesus is literal body on Saturday
[1:21:40] was cold and stiff and dead laying in
[1:21:43] the grave
[1:21:44] amen while he was off doing the other
[1:21:49] work before he came back but watch that
[1:21:53] made the body of Jesus Christ cold stiff
[1:21:56] and dead in the grave shaking to life
[1:21:58] and rise again and roll away the stone I
[1:22:01] am he that was dead so dead til the son
[1:22:05] said he was dead the moon said he was
[1:22:06] dead the star said he was dead all
[1:22:08] nature said he was dead and now the
[1:22:10] world has to recognize that he's alive
[1:22:14] again now that's not it's a future home
[1:22:18] that's right now he's talking about
[1:22:20] right then 1965 4:18 he's alive again he
[1:22:26] was not only mechanic's God's Word he
[1:22:28] was the dynamics to prove it and as he
[1:22:32] being the groom the bride has to come
[1:22:36] forth because it's part of him it's part
[1:22:43] of him and it can only be the
[1:22:46] manifestation of the fulfilling of all
[1:22:48] the revelations any others has spoken of
[1:22:52] the bride it can only be you an hour the
[1:22:59] manifestation of everything that's been
[1:23:01] said about the bride it can only
[1:23:07] manifest if it does something different
[1:23:10] from the groom it isn't the bride
[1:23:12] because she is flesh of his flesh bone
[1:23:16] of his bone life of his life power of
[1:23:21] his power
[1:23:21] she is him as man and woman are one and
[1:23:26] woman taken from his side she had taken
[1:23:30] a spirit the feminist spirit from him
[1:23:32] the flesh from his side made both
[1:23:35] mechanics and dynamics the wife the
[1:23:39] spirit of him and the flesh of him and
[1:23:42] put it together and made mechanics and
[1:23:43] dynamics until the church or the people
[1:23:47] then they stopped here to interject all
[1:23:49] these Easter bunnies and ceremonies big
[1:23:51] churches and fineries will fail and pass
[1:23:53] away until that church becomes both
[1:23:56] dynamics and mechanics and the Spirit of
[1:23:59] God that moved him to do the things that
[1:24:02] he did if he had owned 16 cylinders so
[1:24:06] will the bride a man for he said in John
[1:24:10] 14:12 he that believeth on me the works
[1:24:12] that I do shall he do also
[1:24:14] I'll give him a charge of my dynamics in
[1:24:17] his mechanics that the world will not be
[1:24:21] able to withstand it
[1:24:24] what causes the Tribulation Period
[1:24:28] the literal Tribulation Period what
[1:24:30] causes the literal tribulation period me
[1:24:33] and you are not here it's the wrath of
[1:24:36] God poured out when we leave when the
[1:24:38] Holy Ghost has come off the earth that
[1:24:40] creates the tribulation period that's
[1:24:43] what he said right here that the world
[1:24:47] will not be able to withstand it and
[1:24:50] I'll raise him up again at the last day
[1:24:53] that's the Easter message the dynamics
[1:24:55] and the mechanics together the mechanics
[1:24:58] without the dynamics no good neither is
[1:25:01] the dynamics without the mechanics you
[1:25:04] can scream and shout and jump up and
[1:25:05] down all you want to and deny this word
[1:25:08] it won't do any good they men don't do
[1:25:14] any good
[1:25:15] you're just cranking around the Pistons
[1:25:18] got the spark there to fire but no
[1:25:19] gasoline to fire by it'll only only work
[1:25:25] as they come together amen
[1:25:29] so one will sit still and the other one
[1:25:32] will go up that's the only thing there
[1:25:34] is to it yet they both might look alike
[1:25:37] both claimed to be churches both claimed
[1:25:39] to be brought but one has mechanics and
[1:25:41] dynamics it brings it the pass of what
[1:25:44] he said is the truth it just won't move
[1:25:48] no matter how good the mechanics is
[1:25:51] until the dynamics come when the
[1:25:54] dynamics come that fire is made to
[1:25:57] connect with that octane in the gasoline
[1:26:00] and when that explodes it causes a
[1:26:02] combustion and that combustion moves
[1:26:05] every motion every move for here's the
[1:26:07] same yesterday today and forever
[1:26:09] that's the resurrection you won't know
[1:26:12] what the resurrection is I just read it
[1:26:14] I just read you what the resurrection is
[1:26:19] it's the mechanics and dynamics together
[1:26:21] that fire is made to connect with that
[1:26:23] octane in the gas and when that explodes
[1:26:27] it causes the combustion and that
[1:26:29] combustion moves every motion you know
[1:26:31] what it's going to do it's going to blow
[1:26:32] a hole in that six dimension and when it
[1:26:33] blows a hole in that sixth dimension
[1:26:34] they're gonna walk in this one
[1:26:36] man he's the same yesterday today and
[1:26:38] forever that's the resurrection that's
[1:26:40] the real power of God mechanics with the
[1:26:42] dynamics notice it's the spirits that
[1:26:44] quickens it's the spark that fires it's
[1:26:47] not the gas that fires it's the spark
[1:26:49] that fires the gas amen is to fire that
[1:26:52] sparks the gas now let's read number
[1:26:55] seven
[1:26:55] it still is rising of the Sun that's
[1:26:59] that divine revelation of the Word made
[1:27:02] flesh now listen if it was flesh in that
[1:27:07] day by the Sun the groom it's the flesh
[1:27:10] today by the bride hmm you don't even
[1:27:17] have to stand up and say that in the
[1:27:18] airplane you say that in a message
[1:27:20] Church you probably get thrown out thank
[1:27:24] you it's the flesh in that day by the
[1:27:29] Sun if it was flesh in that day by the
[1:27:33] Sun the groom it's the flesh today by
[1:27:36] the bride who soever sins you remit to
[1:27:39] them their remitted now what he was
[1:27:41] doing I cut that part out but remember
[1:27:42] he had just got finished preaching
[1:27:44] marriage and divorce after he preached
[1:27:45] this and this woman went up to him and
[1:27:47] said hey you made yourself God you
[1:27:49] forgive those people their sins that's
[1:27:52] what she said what is that well that's
[1:27:54] what he's quoting them right here that's
[1:27:56] what he's quoting them right here who
[1:27:57] soever sins you remit to them they are
[1:28:00] remitted and whosoever sins you retain
[1:28:03] to them they are retained now the
[1:28:05] Catholic Church picked that up and takes
[1:28:06] it to their priest but that's carnal
[1:28:09] watch it's the spiritual revealed word
[1:28:13] that did it that's the reason he told
[1:28:16] him to baptize in the name of Father Son
[1:28:18] Holy Ghost he knowed they knew who he
[1:28:21] was you and I know who he is and we know
[1:28:26] what we're doing here but it was the
[1:28:29] spiritual reveal word that did what
[1:28:31] remitted those people their sins wasn't
[1:28:34] William Branham he didn't do that a a
[1:28:37] sinner can't you know born in sin can't
[1:28:39] do that but God had but listened but
[1:28:42] still we have to say what God said about
[1:28:43] us he just told us this to flesh today
[1:28:46] by the bride
[1:28:49] that's the divine revelation of the Word
[1:28:52] made flesh if it was flesh in that day
[1:28:56] by the Sun the groom is too flesh today
[1:29:00] by the bride whoso sends you remit their
[1:29:03] remit hey listen that's exactly what's
[1:29:05] happening all the time like I told you
[1:29:06] walking through the world you walk
[1:29:08] through Wall Martin and you know
[1:29:11] somebody does something for you opens
[1:29:12] the door for you or somebody changes
[1:29:14] your tire on the road what are you doing
[1:29:18] now you didn't save those people but
[1:29:25] because of you in your flesh because of
[1:29:32] you standing there in your flesh with
[1:29:34] God inside at the white throne judgment
[1:29:39] their sins are going to be remitted just
[1:29:44] by you but it's Christ in you but if
[1:29:47] you're connected to that flesh if Christ
[1:29:50] is in your flesh finding me crushed pull
[1:29:54] him out and show him to me
[1:29:56] you can't he's in your flesh he's in
[1:30:00] your very being that's why you got to
[1:30:04] see that we are have already been
[1:30:06] changed we just got to start believing
[1:30:09] it we've already went through the change
[1:30:12] you started changing on a daily or day
[1:30:14] of Pentecost but but you know you say
[1:30:20] that like that woman said said well who
[1:30:22] are you to remit that well my heavens
[1:30:25] it's in the Bible a cup of water in my
[1:30:29] name will not be forgotten in this world
[1:30:31] of the world to come and now what are
[1:30:32] you doing
[1:30:33] your remitting their sin it doesn't
[1:30:35] matter if he's a a ten-time murderer if
[1:30:39] he helps you out one day and you get to
[1:30:43] the white throne judgment and you say
[1:30:45] hey you I've done this many times and
[1:30:46] you say hey Lord you said you wouldn't
[1:30:49] forget what they would do to us even the
[1:30:51] little things cup of water he changed my
[1:30:54] tire well now watch God gonna do God is
[1:30:56] gonna say because of that person and
[1:31:00] point to you
[1:31:02] say because of that person being me made
[1:31:06] manifest in flesh
[1:31:07] whosoever sins he retains retained who
[1:31:10] soever sins Hyrum it will be remitted
[1:31:13] what do you say I say remit go that's
[1:31:18] what you're gonna say how in the world
[1:31:19] can you say anything else because you
[1:31:21] were a recipient of that one day and man
[1:31:24] you were a recipient that maybe a long
[1:31:26] time ago when God came to you he
[1:31:28] remitted your sin did he so now by being
[1:31:32] the bride it's the flesh today that's
[1:31:36] the mystery is that we can walk through
[1:31:39] airports and we walk through Walmart why
[1:31:41] do we use Walmart all the time we want
[1:31:43] to target
[1:31:48] we're just promoting the devil I guess
[1:31:56] I'll promise you I told them the other
[1:31:58] day at Walmart is probably used in the
[1:32:00] pulpit more than word then the Lord's
[1:32:02] name because everybody says I was in
[1:32:04] Walmart the other day or we got to go
[1:32:05] through Walmart or we're going through
[1:32:06] Walmart I guess it's just a place we go
[1:32:11] a lot but no you but now what a great
[1:32:15] mystery and I'm gonna finish right here
[1:32:17] that's the greatest mystery to me is
[1:32:19] that God is now in human flesh your
[1:32:21] flesh working through you to retain sins
[1:32:26] because you know that can work the other
[1:32:28] way some up behind somebody come up and
[1:32:30] curse you out about something and it's
[1:32:32] really not a problem and they didn't you
[1:32:34] know what they're gonna get they're
[1:32:37] gonna get theirs retained because God
[1:32:40] knows not gonna go to remit those sins
[1:32:42] they're gonna be retained but like the
[1:32:46] Bible says whosoever sins you remit they
[1:32:48] remit retained they retain but on a
[1:32:50] sixth Hill purging to me that's what
[1:32:52] God's showing us he's showing us that
[1:32:53] he's already remitted my sin
[1:32:55] he's remitted your sin they're gone that
[1:32:58] you don't have to go to a white throne
[1:33:00] judgment you don't have to go to a
[1:33:01] tribulation they're done today sitting
[1:33:03] in your seat likes it when you get up
[1:33:05] and go to target your God in human flesh
[1:33:09] walking in target
[1:33:13] you ever thought about that you are God
[1:33:17] you're the only God that ever walked
[1:33:18] inner Target or Walmart believers go to
[1:33:28] Walmart I guess maybe that's why we need
[1:33:29] to start of doctor and believe him no I
[1:33:31] don't think so but have you ever thought
[1:33:38] about that way though you sittin you set
[1:33:41] an airport of in Atlanta there's I think
[1:33:45] there's like 50,000 people a day 50,000
[1:33:49] people a day go through that Airport and
[1:33:53] probably just you can count them on your
[1:33:56] hand how many people that really are
[1:33:57] born-again believers of God and you look
[1:34:02] and see what you're walking through
[1:34:05] that's the world that you and I've been
[1:34:07] put in but that's the world that you're
[1:34:09] not being put in to overcome remember
[1:34:14] it's not what you overcome it's how you
[1:34:15] overcome it not be a part of the world
[1:34:19] you have to be in the world but that
[1:34:26] Holy Ghost goes wherever you go you
[1:34:27] don't you know I hope you don't think
[1:34:29] you can leave it in the closet and then
[1:34:30] go do what you want to out there in the
[1:34:31] world and then come back pick it back up
[1:34:33] on Sunday and bring it in here you gonna
[1:34:35] bring something in here and it won't be
[1:34:37] that Amen we must be sensitive though
[1:34:41] that the Holy Ghost a light how many
[1:34:42] times you hear brother Branham um when
[1:34:45] me to shut the door slammed the door on
[1:34:47] brother branham you know and she got in
[1:34:49] trouble why because the Lord was real
[1:34:51] near trying to tell brother Branham
[1:34:53] something I believe and I don't believe
[1:34:55] it was just because brother Branham who
[1:34:57] he was but still though that that spirit
[1:35:00] was so sensitive till she had to
[1:35:03] apologize you know and and then you know
[1:35:06] what happened with the with the other
[1:35:07] part but that's and we know he said well
[1:35:10] that was brother Branham well I got the
[1:35:11] same Holy Ghost he does he did he's
[1:35:14] still got it it's just in another
[1:35:15] dimension he's still God I didn't lose
[1:35:18] it I don't like the quote where people
[1:35:22] say brother Branham was a prophet that
[1:35:26] constitutes that he's not one
[1:35:27] now no he's as much a problem now the
[1:35:29] air will be so brother branham is a
[1:35:32] prophet with the Holy Ghost but now
[1:35:36] remember you and I are trying to get
[1:35:38] this thing together without separating
[1:35:40] it that's what the sixth seal shows me
[1:35:44] that our purging goes on here we don't
[1:35:45] have to go to another place or go to
[1:35:48] another spot it's happening right now
[1:35:50] you're purging is happening now walking
[1:35:53] through the mall thank you
[1:36:00] here we were at them up at the mall oh
[1:36:09] yeah yeah oh that's right he was at a
[1:36:11] mall when he saw hell right okay that's
[1:36:13] true it was at the mall so well maybe
[1:36:16] that was a precursor of Walmart he did
[1:36:22] have a dream he did have a vision at the
[1:36:24] mall didn't he stay away from the mall
[1:36:27] but you know we were in the Mall of Asia
[1:36:29] do you get to go to the Mall of Asia
[1:36:30] John no big smile in the world and this
[1:36:33] thing's seven stories tall and you
[1:36:35] cannot literally see the end of it it's
[1:36:37] that big and but we as believers we
[1:36:40] walked in there we said at a coffee shop
[1:36:42] and we had coffee and we talked about
[1:36:44] the Lord we talked about the things we
[1:36:45] were gonna do in the Philippines and you
[1:36:47] know what if you could see with
[1:36:48] spiritual eyes there was just angels all
[1:36:51] around us the glory of the Lord was
[1:36:55] shining you know they always make these
[1:36:57] little pictures of Jesus with the halo
[1:36:58] over his head I don't believe that Jesus
[1:37:02] he was a secret and so are you you're a
[1:37:05] secret you're a secret now one day we
[1:37:08] are gonna be displayed to the world but
[1:37:10] right now as you walk through the world
[1:37:11] you don't have this glow coming off your
[1:37:13] shoulders it's all from within but if
[1:37:16] you were to look in a supernatural realm
[1:37:17] you could see things so it's the same
[1:37:20] way I want you to think about all the
[1:37:21] things you do in your life when you're
[1:37:22] going to you know get your car done and
[1:37:24] you anything you want to don't think
[1:37:26] well you know gods I left him at the
[1:37:28] house no he's there I just read you he's
[1:37:33] in fleshing out God's in your flesh of
[1:37:35] my flesh and he wants to less tender fee
[1:37:38] he wants to make us
[1:37:40] in that sixth seal purging he wants to
[1:37:43] finish the mystery he will finish the
[1:37:47] mystery with the Gentile dispensation in
[1:37:50] flesh he started it in flesh and he will
[1:37:54] end it in flesh hey man they weren't so
[1:37:58] great of people on the day of Pentecost
[1:37:59] but God came down into 120 human flesh
[1:38:02] and started this work called redemption
[1:38:06] of the Gentile Church and you and I are
[1:38:09] at the other end of it and we are
[1:38:10] recipients of the same thing but we have
[1:38:13] now the seven seals open so that you and
[1:38:16] I can see that it's not going to happen
[1:38:18] to another group of people it's going to
[1:38:20] happen to this group or it's not going
[1:38:22] to happen to you at all we're either in
[1:38:25] or out see to me that's that's to me
[1:38:28] that started all two started tribulation
[1:38:30] inside of you that ought to start in
[1:38:33] motion something to make sure
[1:38:34] everything's good make sure everything's
[1:38:36] right make sure everything's going good
[1:38:38] musicians y'all come on but remember
[1:38:43] this sixth seal that we're on which
[1:38:46] we'll get into Sunday afternoons we'll
[1:38:48] bring it to us but that's what finishes
[1:38:51] I had a quote here from Feast of the
[1:38:53] trumpets I've already read it before the
[1:38:54] sixth seal finishes the mystery six
[1:38:58] seals finishes the mystery just before
[1:39:01] the seventh is opening because remember
[1:39:03] the seventh seal when it opens there's
[1:39:04] nothing going on there's no symbol
[1:39:06] there's no angel there's no light
[1:39:09] there's nothing goes on having this
[1:39:12] silence everything's finished he just
[1:39:16] steps on the scene and a bride and takes
[1:39:20] us out of here

[1:41:34] life the original scene our eyes have
[1:41:40] understanding he has opened up at last
[1:41:44] and sweet victory is ours who were
[1:41:47] chained down in the past true to believe

[1:42:08] it's what I believe
[1:42:12] it's revealed by seven seals
[1:42:16] at all

[1:42:23] unto a dog gentle
[1:42:26] or a teen pile sleeping st. for we can
[1:42:30] join us for translation in this out
[1:42:33] Gentile day
[1:42:35] Sammy over
[1:42:38] who you are God say it time to the
[1:42:41] original
[1:42:43] the original one
[1:42:46] [Music]
[1:42:48] the original world
[1:42:51] [Music]
[1:42:54] son of mine
[1:42:56] it's a what seal isn't they all the
[1:43:00] original line
[1:43:02] the original scene who watched the son
[1:43:06] of man
[1:43:06] asada man was the word made flesh what
[1:43:10] are you what are you
[1:43:13] you're the word made flesh verse 14 and
[1:43:19] John is talking about you and the word
[1:43:23] was made flesh and dwelt among us we
[1:43:25] know it was talking about the
[1:43:26] firstfruits but remember if the
[1:43:28] firstfruits is the firstfruits there's
[1:43:30] more fruit behind it
[1:43:31] hey man can I start I wrote the feast
[1:43:34] down let me get this to you real quick
[1:43:35] we'll talk about it maybe later on you
[1:43:37] got four feast as Bob was talking about
[1:43:39] you got Passover unleavened bread
[1:43:41] firstfruits and feast of Pentecost then
[1:43:45] there's a gap then you've got the feast
[1:43:48] of trumpets atonement and the feast of
[1:43:50] tabernacles Israel has not been through
[1:43:54] those feast days yet as far as trumpets
[1:43:56] automa tabernacle and even the day of
[1:43:58] Pentecost will they've not had their day
[1:44:00] of Pentecost yet all right so they got
[1:44:02] to go through these but there's a gap
[1:44:03] between four and five there's a 2000
[1:44:08] year gap of church ages the feast of
[1:44:10] Pentecost happened on the day of
[1:44:12] Pentecost a literal day of the feast of
[1:44:15] Pentecost is the day the Holy Ghost fell
[1:44:17] the literal day all right
[1:44:19] and to be real it's kind of strange I
[1:44:24] forgot to mention this but the day that
[1:44:26] Trump signed the acknowledgment that
[1:44:30] Israel could reclaim the Golan Heights
[1:44:33] as theirs was the day of Purim remember
[1:44:38] what that is that's when Esther that's
[1:44:42] when extra they have the day of Purim
[1:44:44] every year to show that Esther had went
[1:44:46] into the King and got the decree not
[1:44:49] changed but a decree that they could
[1:44:51] fight for their own land and fight for
[1:44:54] their own self what about that I don't
[1:44:56] think that was a coincidence I think
[1:44:59] that that was the hand of Almighty God
[1:45:01] but you look at the feast of trumpets
[1:45:03] and atonement tabernacle that's your
[1:45:05] fall feast if you take five six and
[1:45:07] seven I think we may parallel them with
[1:45:09] the seals here pretty quick but those
[1:45:12] feast days meaning a lot because God
[1:45:13] told them he said you do this till I
[1:45:15] come back and they're still doing it I
[1:45:18] mean they they're doing it do it over
[1:45:19] there in Israel all the time then like I
[1:45:21] said the feast of Purim which is not one
[1:45:23] of the seven feasts but it is one of
[1:45:24] their feast happened on that day that
[1:45:27] Trump decreed that was their land so
[1:45:33] they have what what was the decree the
[1:45:35] decree was you can defend your property
[1:45:40] remember remember the king couldn't
[1:45:42] change it and say well we can't fight
[1:45:45] but we can put it to where you can
[1:45:47] defend yourself and you can defend your
[1:45:50] own property that's what the day of
[1:45:51] Purim is so that's what Israel doing
[1:45:53] they're fighting for their land so that
[1:45:55] land means a lot to them and it does
[1:45:57] because you know what Abraham everywhere
[1:45:59] the soul your feet walk that's what I'm
[1:46:01] gonna give you so they believe in that
[1:46:04] so it's a wonderful hour we see these
[1:46:06] things coming and you know what we're
[1:46:08] recipients of it we can walk through
[1:46:10] Walmart we can walk through the
[1:46:12] different places and know that God's
[1:46:14] right there not a second person that we
[1:46:17] got a my even Moses said why are we
[1:46:20] looking for God over the sea why are we
[1:46:23] looking for him up in the air he's
[1:46:24] naughty even in thy mouth why he's in
[1:46:29] your heart
[1:46:31] if you're born again here's your heart
[1:46:34] you have no other heart not this heart
[1:46:37] but you have no other heart but God amen
[1:46:40] let's bow our heads
[1:46:41] gently father thank you for this day
[1:46:43] Lord that we did you give us the for a
[1:46:48] few moments Lord to expound a little
[1:46:50] more on on what we see of you father I
[1:46:53] pray Lord as we go out into this world
[1:46:55] we make our little comments and quotes
[1:46:58] and quips but Lord we know one thing's
[1:47:00] for sure Satan would love to destroy
[1:47:01] some time we walked out this door but
[1:47:04] Lord you're protecting angels Lord the
[1:47:05] anointing that you have given us in this
[1:47:08] endtime has given us supernatural
[1:47:11] protection and Lord we let us not deny
[1:47:15] it and let us not hide from it but Lord
[1:47:17] let us walk through this world and know
[1:47:19] that we're the only God the people will
[1:47:22] ever see Lord we didn't see you hanging
[1:47:25] at Calvary but we know you did and we're
[1:47:28] the recipients of that and Lord we can
[1:47:30] give it out to other people
[1:47:33] but it's a total secret to the world
[1:47:35] father we pray this should be with us
[1:47:38] now Lord purchase in coming into this
[1:47:40] sixth seal that we look at for the bride
[1:47:42] we know it's for the land and we know it
[1:47:44] or the world and we know it's for the
[1:47:46] foolish virgin and we know it's for
[1:47:47] Israel the Lord will not 6dl opens it
[1:47:50] shows a complete disruption of our human
