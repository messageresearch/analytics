[2:54] very moment she just took a few days and
[2:58] visited her her family up there so you
[3:02] just she landed about three o'clock this
[3:04] afternoon

[3:13] something like that yeah yeah well this
[3:17] come in a few days the high is gonna be
[3:19] like 16 all right so let's go to the
[3:23] word this evening uh if you want to turn
[3:25] to second Corinthians chapter 4 I'm not
[3:27] going to I'm not gonna preach too long
[3:30] and maybe 25 minutes or so 30 minutes
[3:33] and then so we can get into report
[3:34] because Chris
[3:36] Bella is also she's gonna present about
[3:40] five minutes or so say what she
[3:42] experienced so and then we'll get into a
[3:47] report we'll have we have lots of videos
[3:49] and lots of images and we'll just try to
[3:52] get through them as as quick as we can
[3:54] and but I want to hit some highlights
[3:56] and just talk about some things that I
[3:59] think are important that we experienced
[4:01] down there so you all just pray for us
[4:04] amen oh I'll try not to keep you here
[4:06] too long tonight second Corinthians
[4:09] chapter 4 verse 1 this is the word says
[4:12] therefore seeing we have this ministry
[4:14] as we have received mercy we faint not
[4:17] but we have renounced the hidden things
[4:20] of dishonesty not walking in craftiness
[4:23] not handling the Word of God deceitfully
[4:25] but by manifestation of the truth
[4:28] commending ourselves to every man's
[4:30] conscience in the sight of God
[4:33] but if if our gospel be hid it is hid to
[4:37] them that are lost in whom the god of
[4:39] this world hath blinded the minds of
[4:42] them which believe not
[4:44] lest the light of the glorious gospel of
[4:47] Christ who is the image of God should
[4:49] shine unto them for we preach not
[4:52] ourselves but Christ Jesus the Lord and
[4:56] ourselves your servants for Jesus sake I
[4:59] believe every Minister can should say
[5:01] the same thing amen
[5:02] it's not about us and men it's about
[5:05] Christ for God who commanded the light
[5:09] to shine out of darkness had shined in
[5:11] our hearts to give the light of the
[5:13] knowledge of the glory of God in the
[5:15] face of Jesus Christ but we have this
[5:18] treasure in earthen vessels that the
[5:21] excellency of the power may be of God
[5:23] and not of us we are troubled on every
[5:27] side yet not distressed we are perplexed
[5:31] but not in despair persecuted but not
[5:34] forsaken I cast down but not destroyed
[5:38] always bearing about in the body in the
[5:43] body the dying of the Lord Jesus that
[5:45] the life also of Jesus might be made
[5:48] manifest in our body amen Lord added
[5:52] blessing to the reading of the word you
[5:53] may be seated this afternoon this
[5:54] evening praise the Lord hey man I just
[5:58] want to talk this morning and maybe if I
[6:01] give it a little tylo I want to title it
[6:03] uh I'm a loser and you should be too
[6:08] yeah I hope you got that I got your
[6:11] attention amen praise God I just want to
[6:17] want to talk about how God is pleased to
[6:24] dwell in you and me amen and it wasn't
[6:28] just for the Lord Jesus Christ when he
[6:29] was here on earth and in in and he said
[6:32] in him I'm pleased to dwell when the
[6:35] voice said in him I'm pleased to dwell
[6:37] but if you right now with the Holy
[6:39] Spirit in your life amen God has said
[6:42] the same thing about you amen otherwise
[6:44] he has not he wouldn't have given you
[6:46] the Holy Ghost amen he is pleased to
[6:49] dwell in you and I men and so Paul here
[6:52] is speaking about how we are
[6:55] earthen vessels amen we are earthen
[6:59] vessels that God has chosen that light
[7:02] that he said at the beginning for that
[7:05] he used to create the heavens and the
[7:07] earth
[7:07] amen which that God I explained though
[7:10] one another time that that light is life
[7:13] amen
[7:14] that life God has wanted God wants to
[7:19] place in you and me this is in this hour
[7:21] he meant what uh what a wonderful God
[7:25] that we served that he wants to dwell in
[7:27] you and me I meant to manifest himself
[7:29] to the world through you and I Who am I
[7:33] who are you amen you know what you kind
[7:37] of look like you lived you know I knew
[7:39] what kind of life I lived amen
[7:41] but God can take these type of vessels
[7:45] they meant earthen vessels dirty vessels
[7:48] clean them up fill them with something
[7:51] good they meant to do a great thing in
[7:53] this hour amen and that's you and I
[7:55] praise God young people that's you and I
[7:59] God wants to work through you God wants
[8:02] to use you to save others you may not
[8:09] think so Oh Who am I that you know what
[8:12] can I say you don't have to say anything
[8:14] just live before the people just live
[8:17] before the people and that'll take
[8:19] that'll take care of your day men praise
[8:21] God so so Paul here is speaking about he
[8:24] says here in verse six he says for God
[8:26] who commanded the light to shine out of
[8:28] darkness has shined in our hearts to
[8:31] give the light of the knowledge of the
[8:33] glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ
[8:35] but we have this treasure in earthen
[8:38] vessels you know and then when you look
[8:42] back at this word that the earthen
[8:43] vessels it's kind of like like clay pots
[8:46] at Walmart yeah there's not as it's not
[8:50] it's not Chinese vases that like for you
[8:54] know those porcelain vases that you see
[8:56] it expensive vases you know God didn't
[9:00] choose something like that
[9:02] he chose the cheap little Walmart clay
[9:05] pots that you see over there in the
[9:06] corner that nobody's touching but
[9:09] somebody that needs those pots amen all
[9:12] right some of you that are gardeners and
[9:13] some of you that not like to deal with
[9:15] plants you need those those pots for
[9:17] your service amen
[9:19] and God chose these put these weak
[9:21] vessels amen these these pots these clay
[9:24] pots amen so that he can fill them up to
[9:27] get something to grow out of that amen
[9:29] praise God you're not who am i as I said
[9:34] you're not you're not anybody to the
[9:35] world to the world you're nothing but to
[9:39] God Amen you're everything amen
[9:41] because he dwells in you amen you might
[9:45] be at work you're working your your the
[9:48] the brother is working may be whistling
[9:50] Amazing Grace singing singing to God
[9:52] yeah and and his wife is at home she's
[9:56] doing cooking maybe taking care of the
[9:59] children doing what she's doing but
[10:01] she's doing it wholeheartedly with all
[10:03] with all that she uh with full passion
[10:06] in it and wants to serve the Lord with
[10:08] it and the world sees nothing amen
[10:11] but God sees everything amen oh you
[10:15] might say oh it's ho-hum it's it's it's
[10:18] everyday amen
[10:19] but you know what in the everyday things
[10:22] is how God wants us to see him it's in
[10:25] their everyday routines where God wants
[10:29] to teach you to see him oh it's good to
[10:33] see him in the exhale you know in there
[10:36] in the in the outstanding things that
[10:39] take place in our lives and an
[10:41] extraordinary explosive things amen
[10:44] but God doesn't always work that way
[10:46] sometimes he comes in as a still small
[10:49] voice nothing moved
[10:52] nothing shook nothing sounded but God
[10:57] was there you may not hurt anything you
[11:00] may not seen lights you may not see
[11:02] nothing bright you may not seen anything
[11:04] Amen or felt anything but God is there
[11:08] how many of know believe that God is
[11:11] there I believe God is there amen
[11:15] because that desire II meant for more of
[11:18] him it's there now if you don't desire
[11:21] more of God then
[11:22] God wasn't there in the first place but
[11:25] when you're filled with his spirit amen
[11:27] and when you have God in your life amen
[11:29] you want more of him amen because the
[11:31] Holy Spirit in you only the only wants
[11:34] more of him he only can feed on the word
[11:36] amen praise the Lord Jesus so what a
[11:40] privilege that that light that that
[11:43] eternal life that God uh that God used
[11:46] that to create the heavens and the earth
[11:49] dwell in you and me yes out in the world
[11:54] knows nothing about it
[11:55] the world knows nothing about it all
[11:58] they see on the outside is sisters with
[12:01] long uncut hair and and long dresses and
[12:08] and brothers who don't wear you know
[12:11] tight jeans and and you know walk around
[12:14] like that and and and and and and you
[12:17] know don't go around with a cigarette in
[12:20] their mouth and you know and earrings
[12:23] and earrings in their nose and stuff
[12:25] like that they don't see that and they
[12:28] might criticize you not knowing that God
[12:31] is dwelling the god that they might say
[12:33] they might say I'm a Christian to the
[12:36] God that they say they're Christian and
[12:38] that they serve dwells in you and me
[12:40] what a privilege
[12:42] praise God amen so you know and and God
[12:50] wanted it to be that way a mint because
[12:53] he wants him to get the glory not for
[12:57] you to get the glory amen because when
[13:01] when you when something happens
[13:03] extraordinary in your life or something
[13:05] took place in your life people might say
[13:07] well I know God couldn't have done that
[13:10] I know I know that person wouldn't have
[13:13] done that I knew him before he came to
[13:15] be a Christian
[13:16] I need her before she looked the way
[13:19] they talked looked at the way they lived
[13:20] and when God does something
[13:22] extraordinary through your life then
[13:23] they got to realize it is it was God not
[13:27] you man
[13:28] praise God so that's the reason why God
[13:31] has decided to put this this uh this
[13:36] light this in earthen vessels such as
[13:39] you and me in first Corinthians chapter
[13:41] 1 verse 17 it says for Christ sent me
[13:45] not to baptize but to preach the gospel
[13:47] not with wisdom of words lest the cross
[13:50] of Christ should be made of none effect
[13:53] for the preaching of the Cross is to
[13:55] them that perish foolishness but unto us
[13:58] which are saved it is the power of God
[14:02] my goodness why why is it you always
[14:04] wonder why is it that God will decided
[14:07] it to be that way for somebody up here
[14:12] to be slobbering in front of you you
[14:15] know you come like a brutal brother Joel
[14:17] Forney you know he'll come over here and
[14:19] you better my sometimes you better watch
[14:22] out hey I know that for firsthand I was
[14:27] interpreting for him one time and he
[14:30] turned around like this I was right here
[14:33] on his left side and here it comes the
[14:34] sweat right on my lips as I was speaking
[14:39] [Laughter]
[14:41] of course you couldn't you just go like
[14:44] that you know you had to finish what you
[14:45] had to say but you know what that's what
[14:50] God decided that's how he's going to
[14:53] show his power amen through the
[14:55] foolishness of preaching amen
[14:57] now we know that's not just not the only
[14:59] way amen God God could use us in many
[15:02] different ways
[15:03] but this is how God established for his
[15:05] word to go forth amen and that doesn't
[15:08] make me doesn't make brother way brother
[15:10] Dale any of the ministers here anything
[15:12] more than you amen praise God because
[15:15] I've always said you know a minister is
[15:18] one that serves is one that serves I'm
[15:21] here you're actually greater than us
[15:23] because we're serving you think about it
[15:27] that way I'm not anything that's why I
[15:29] can't stand you know we've seen people
[15:33] ministers sitting in the back and things
[15:35] like that you know if a church does it
[15:37] that way that's fine but but I just I
[15:39] don't feel comfortable like that you
[15:40] know I haven't a minister sitting back
[15:42] here and and and you know and that's I
[15:45] want to be with the people you know
[15:47] that's that's cuz I'm one of you
[15:49] amen there's God but I mean that's
[15:51] that's damned if they want to do that
[15:53] but that's just my personal preference
[15:55] amen praise God or the preaching of the
[15:58] Cross is to them that perish foolishness
[16:00] but unto us which are saved that is the
[16:03] power of God for it is written I will
[16:05] destroy the wisdom of the wise and will
[16:07] bring to nothing the understanding of
[16:09] the prudent amen
[16:11] where is the wise where is the scribe
[16:13] where is the disputer of this world hath
[16:16] not God made foolish the wisdom of this
[16:19] world
[16:21] he certainly has and he's doing it
[16:24] through you and me oh my can you imagine
[16:28] that you know you might think who I'm
[16:31] about to stand in front of President
[16:33] Trump or the President of Spain or the
[16:35] president of
[16:38] though the power of God dwells right
[16:41] here in this little town called Loula
[16:43] Georgia right now Washington DC ya
[16:47] Washington has has believers there right
[16:50] and so it so but but what I'm saying is
[16:54] that who would think that God wants to
[16:57] dwell in this little and little weakened
[17:00] vessels like you and me Amen for after
[17:06] that in the wisdom of God the world by
[17:08] wisdom knew not god they pleased God by
[17:10] the foolishness of preaching to save
[17:12] them that believe there it is again
[17:16] for the Jews require a sign and the
[17:19] Greeks seek after wisdom but we preach
[17:22] Christ crucified unto the Jews a
[17:25] stumbling-block and unto the Greeks
[17:27] foolishness and then Greeks you know
[17:31] being us Gentiles as well you know it
[17:34] was foolish to us for that for the
[17:36] natural man doesn't understand naturally
[17:39] the things of God you know to look us to
[17:43] us I mean you know how you were when you
[17:44] were not a Christian and somebody talked
[17:46] to you about Christ thought it was
[17:49] foolishness you know Christ but unto
[17:54] them which are called both Jews and
[17:56] Greeks Christ the power of God and the
[17:58] wisdom of God because the foolishness of
[18:00] God is wiser than men and the weakness
[18:03] of God is stronger than men now read
[18:08] that again for the foolishness of God
[18:10] but hold on a second because the
[18:13] foolishness of God is wiser than men so
[18:17] in other words if God had foolishness
[18:21] if there was foolishness in his in him
[18:28] you know that would be more wise than
[18:33] though holding the greatest wisdom here
[18:35] on them upon this earth amen
[18:37] you know I've said before the people in
[18:40] the out in the world they're looking for
[18:42] Superstars and they're looking for
[18:44] superheroes and they manifest it because
[18:47] that's what they show in the movie
[18:48] theaters there's about every three
[18:50] months it's always some sort of
[18:52] superhero movie coming out and they
[18:55] they're just lining them up and anyone
[18:57] that when they got it when they got done
[18:58] they'll just do part two of the they
[19:00] already got spider-man up to life part
[19:02] ten now superheroes superheroes
[19:06] everywhere why because they want a
[19:08] superhero they're looking for
[19:11] superheroes amen but not knowing the
[19:13] superheroes are right here amongst them
[19:15] walk in and working amongst them and
[19:17] they don't even realize it and it's not
[19:19] because of them is because the superhero
[19:21] that dwells in them amen
[19:24] Jesus Christ you're the true super here
[19:28] on this side right amen gödel when you
[19:33] were there working at where were you
[19:36] were at GM General Motors they might
[19:39] have probably seen brother Dale just
[19:41] someone in the common common guy just
[19:43] like one of us not knowing that that was
[19:46] God walking walking amongst them amen
[19:50] and that's what the people are looking
[19:52] for that's what the world wants and that
[19:55] but they'll fulfill it with something
[19:57] else and they'll bring in a spider-man
[19:59] and they'll bring in a Captain America
[20:01] and they'll bring in a Wolverine and not
[20:03] an x-men and all kinds of stuff knowing
[20:07] that you are a superhero on this hour
[20:08] right man because the superhero dwells
[20:11] in you the Superman dwells in you hey
[20:14] man Christ amen because but God had
[20:19] chosen the foolish things of the world
[20:20] to confound the wise and God has chosen
[20:22] the weak things of the world to confound
[20:24] the things which are mighty again that's
[20:28] you and me
[20:31] and base things of the world and things
[20:34] which are despised hath God chosen yea
[20:36] and things which are not to bring to
[20:38] nought things that are that no flesh
[20:41] should glory in his presence that is the
[20:44] purpose of all these things so that no
[20:47] flesh will glory in his presence
[20:49] so yes you are a super here on this hour
[20:52] because you have the superhero the
[20:55] superhero dwelling in you but it's for
[20:57] his glory amen and not for your glory
[21:00] praise God but of him but of him are ye
[21:08] in Christ Jesus
[21:10] but if him are you in Christ Jesus who
[21:13] of God is made unto us wisdom and
[21:15] righteousness and sanctification and
[21:16] redemption that according as it is
[21:19] written he that glorieth let him glory
[21:21] in the Lord amen
[21:26] I can't glory in in what I've done or
[21:30] what I can do a men because anything
[21:33] that I have accomplished it's because
[21:35] been through him a man he's the one
[21:38] that's given me the strength he's the
[21:39] one that's given me the life he's the
[21:41] one that's given me I'm you know every
[21:43] single heartbeat that you have is
[21:45] because of him nothing that you've done
[21:48] right if he said right now is this this
[21:50] is it this is this is a much time I have
[21:53] allotted for you are you ready to go
[21:57] right now at this very moment because we

[22:13] little bit more Lord yeah I need to do
[22:15] this I got to do this I got to finish
[22:17] this I got
[22:20] amen we should be willing to say like
[22:23] John Amen Lord - come quickly that's
[22:26] what the Bride of Christ has said it
[22:28] says amen and in Matthew chapter 16
[22:33] verse 24 and this is the reason why I
[22:35] said you know I'm a loser we're gonna be
[22:38] done here pretty quick says then said
[22:40] Jesus unto his disciples If any man will
[22:43] come after me let him deny himself and
[22:46] take up his cross and follow me listen
[22:50] for whosoever will save his life shall
[22:52] lose it and whosoever will lose his life
[22:58] for my sake shall find it so how many
[23:03] wants to be a loser that's what I was
[23:10] talking about amen
[23:12] I'm a loser because of that I want to
[23:16] lose myself so that he can take the
[23:18] preeminence Amen so that if I want to
[23:20] save my life I better lose it first you
[23:23] better die to yourself if you want to
[23:25] save yourself amen and I'm so glad that
[23:28] it's not through us that said we can't
[23:29] save ourselves and you can't forgive
[23:32] your own sins but he's already paid it
[23:34] for all for us Amen he's already done a
[23:36] work for us and we we just thank him for
[23:38] that amen
[23:39] so for whosoever will save his life
[23:42] shall lose it what is saving your life
[23:44] amen
[23:44] in other words you live for yourself in
[23:48] other words you it's it's about me and I
[23:51] live for myself and it's about me and
[23:53] you acknowledge God your own
[23:55] acknowledged God at all Amen if it's if
[23:58] that's the way you live your life then
[23:59] you're gonna lose it sure you might
[24:02] enjoy yourself you might have fun in
[24:04] this in this life but in the life to
[24:06] come you're not gonna win they men who
[24:09] is however will lose his life for my
[24:11] sake shall find it that's Jesus's own
[24:13] words praise God amen
[24:18] and you know sometimes we're wondering
[24:22] we wonder Lord how in the world can you
[24:25] use me I'm imperfect look what I did
[24:27] look what I've done and you know Satan
[24:29] always comes around and tells us you

[24:35] what you know look what you said look
[24:37] what you thought look look look
[24:40] see see see watch watch and he'll even
[24:44] probably tell you what you're gonna do
[24:46] probably probably to why you did it
[24:48] yesterday you're gonna do it tomorrow
[24:49] again and if you accept the lie of the
[24:52] devil like man that's the reason why we
[24:54] keep falling the same thing over and
[24:56] over and over in the same besetting sin
[24:59] over and over and over and it's like a
[25:02] roller coaster ride you go you're up and
[25:05] down you're up and down you know you're

[25:23] roller coaster again hey man that's not
[25:27] how God made it that's not the holy
[25:29] spirit that God put in you and me ain't
[25:31] man to go up and down up and down right
[25:33] willingly because we're the ones to do
[25:36] that to ourselves
[25:39] jesus said my burden is light
[25:42] we're the ones who make it heavy
[25:45] we're the ones who who who make the the
[25:48] Christian life difficult when Jesus
[25:52] himself said my burden is light we just
[25:57] you know Jesus lightens it up for us
[25:59] because as as you as you give in to the
[26:02] word and as you yield yourself to him
[26:05] amen he's lightening that load in your
[26:08] life right he'll take it get rid of it
[26:12] but then all of a sudden we we somehow
[26:15] pick it back up again just start
[26:18] carrying it again maybe to like first
[26:21] three months of the year
[26:24] when and then he'll and then Lord I'm
[26:28] sorry I'm sorry forgive me and you laid
[26:31] that okay and then he'll take get rid of
[26:35] it again
[26:35] but you're watching to see where he
[26:37] threw it yeah to go pick it back up
[26:40] again I know but Christian doesn't do
[26:47] we're not we're not roller coaster
[26:49] religion right up and down up and down
[26:53] amen the Christian is firm is stable
[26:55] Amen because Christ is stable they men
[26:58] because Christ is firm a man that he's
[27:01] the same yesterday today and forever and
[27:04] if Christ is in you you should be the
[27:05] same yesterday today and forever amen
[27:09] praise God yes we're gonna make mistakes
[27:11] we're gonna fall amen we're gonna we're
[27:13] gonna do we're gonna displease him
[27:15] sometimes amen but you want to quickly
[27:18] get rid of that you want to quickly
[27:20] repent amen praise God it's a new year
[27:25] Saints and uh I need think I need this
[27:28] just as much as you do amen
[27:30] I we all we all need amen because the
[27:35] Saints if we don't know what's gonna
[27:36] take place this year Amen wait this is
[27:39] uh just things are just coming down to a
[27:43] amen
[27:44] praise God so amen but God wants to use
[27:51] us weak vessels and and and and if you
[27:55] remember in 2nd Corinthians chapter 12
[27:57] amen when Paul he said he said here and
[28:01] lest I should be exalted above measure
[28:04] through the abundance of the revelations
[28:06] there was given to me a thorn in the
[28:09] flesh for me for in the flesh the
[28:12] messenger of Satan to buffet me lest I
[28:15] should be exalted above measure
[28:17] sometimes God just needs to he he might
[28:21] put something in there in your life and
[28:23] you wonders Lord why is this not going
[28:25] away
[28:26] well I Love You Lord I'm serving you I'm
[28:29] sorry but God Amen knows how to keep you
[28:32] humble knows how to keep you meek
[28:35] otherwise you know where most of us will
[28:37] be walking like this be walking like
[28:47] this God knows how to God knows exactly
[28:50] what you need to keep you amen dependent
[28:54] on him dependent on for him to get the
[28:58] glory amen
[29:00] and look what Paul says here continues
[29:02] to say he says for this thing I besought
[29:06] the Lord thrice that it might it might
[29:08] depart from me whatever it is you know
[29:12] there's speculations that because of his
[29:14] eyes you know he couldn't see well and
[29:17] he said unto me this is what the Lord
[29:20] said unto Paul my grace is sufficient
[29:23] for you amen my grace is sufficient for
[29:27] thee and you know one timeout one time I
[29:32] was in the in the restroom out of out of
[29:34] all places
[29:37] and that thought just came to mind to my
[29:40] head my grace is sufficient for up for
[29:43] thee and I realized why is it that the
[29:46] Lord told Paul that it's because that's
[29:50] all he needed that's all he needed the
[29:56] when you have the grace of God amen you
[30:00] got love you got everything amen
[30:03] when you got the grace of God that's all
[30:07] he needed to even take care of that
[30:10] issue that he was there he was amen and
[30:13] if we could just depend on his grace and
[30:15] and be thankful for that grace amen
[30:19] praise God and he said unto me my grace
[30:22] is sufficient for thee for my strength
[30:24] is made perfect in weakness imagine that
[30:29] my strength this is this is God speaking
[30:33] to Paul amen mmm my strength is made
[30:37] perfect in weakness most gladly
[30:40] therefore will I rather glory in my
[30:42] infirmities that the power of Christ may
[30:45] rest upon me
[30:46] oh that's just silly you know praising
[30:50] God when you're sick and you're vomiting
[30:52] and and you have a hundred and three
[30:55] degree fever and you're in the hospital
[30:57] and and there's been an accident and
[31:00] you've been sent to a hospital and and
[31:01] all kinds of bad things taking place in
[31:03] your life but you're still there
[31:04] praising God that's foolishness to the
[31:08] world amen
[31:09] but it's beautiful to the Lord amen
[31:13] especially if it comes from your heart
[31:15] amen sometimes like I said we don't
[31:19] understand why some things happen in our
[31:22] lives and I can't explain it and you
[31:25] maybe we'll never get to explain it here
[31:27] on this life maybe the Lord one day will
[31:29] reveal it to us I don't know but it
[31:32] brought you to the place that you are
[31:33] now amen
[31:35] it brought you to the place where you
[31:37] are now because God wanted you to be
[31:39] here at this hour
[31:41] this is where God wanted you to be so
[31:44] that he gets the glory amen
[31:47] because it's it's it's he's still
[31:49] working on me to make me what I want to
[31:53] be and you know you might say you might
[31:56] say I want to be this way the Lord I
[31:57] want this in my life but God's thinking
[31:59] of a totally different way to bring that
[32:01] to you totally different than what you
[32:04] think it's gonna be and then we wondered
[32:06] why is it that it's happening to me like
[32:09] this Lord but that's the way God is
[32:11] trying to bring you he's trying to
[32:12] answer your prayer through that
[32:16] sometimes we don't understand God's ways
[32:19] but those are his perfect ways amen
[32:21] praise God amen so in finishing Amen
[32:25] some of you may have heard this story
[32:27] before but if you've heard it before
[32:30] hear it again he may one day there was a
[32:34] there one day there was a little boy who
[32:35] had gotten into a car accident and the
[32:38] little boy he lost his left arm and so
[32:44] the little boy you know he lost his left
[32:47] arm and got home got you know got well
[32:49] recuperated but he didn't want to stay
[32:51] all his life you know just sitting
[32:54] around not doing anything just because
[32:55] he lost his left arm you know you know
[32:58] sometimes sometimes we get we get so
[33:01] complex in our life you know just
[33:04] because we got this in my life well I'm
[33:06] just gonna end up just going this way or
[33:08] doing this and you know that's the time
[33:10] to stand up amen and and and do
[33:14] something that Lord you got me in this
[33:15] position and he meant but what is it
[33:17] that you want to want me to do a man
[33:18] there's you still want you have me here
[33:20] with life what is it that you want me to
[33:22] fulfill a man every day that you have
[33:25] that God gives you of life there's
[33:27] something that you must fulfill praise
[33:29] God somebody is looking at your life
[33:31] somebody's depending on you amen praise
[33:33] God so this little boy he he says he
[33:39] tells his parents he says he decides he
[33:40] wants to take judo classes so the little
[33:43] boy those parents said ok that's fine so
[33:46] they found a a a master in town who
[33:49] could teach him judo so he went to the
[33:52] master and he said master well you could
[33:54] teach me judo even though I have this
[33:56] handicapped in my life and he said sure
[33:59] thing son they'll be fine
[34:00] so he enroll he was ready he was excited
[34:03] for the first day of class and when he
[34:05] got to the first day class there was one
[34:07] move that he kept the master kept
[34:09] teaching him a men and and the boy was
[34:13] excited he was excited about that that
[34:15] one move and so he's like okay tomorrow
[34:17] I'm gonna go and he's gonna teach me
[34:19] something else but when he would go to
[34:20] the class he teach him the same move and
[34:23] then they'd go third day and fourth day
[34:25] weeks and weeks and it be the same move
[34:28] that he would he was learning and so the
[34:31] kid was like wondering why in the world
[34:33] so a time came where he had to he was
[34:37] fighting a he was having uh you know
[34:40] fighting opponents and he was winning
[34:43] but he could not explain to himself why
[34:46] is it that he was winning he knew the
[34:48] move and he was winning through that one
[34:51] move but he could not explain why he was
[34:53] winning and then there came a time where
[34:55] he had to fight it in a championship and
[34:57] he went through all the opponents got to
[35:00] the last opponent which was the champion
[35:02] of of Champions and and and and and he
[35:05] was clogging him and he was he was about
[35:08] to lose but then all of a sudden the boy
[35:09] does this one move and he goes down and
[35:12] he wins the whole the whole tournament
[35:14] and so the boy he's wandering and he's
[35:16] still scratching his head and he's
[35:18] excited and he asked the master after
[35:20] leaving the tournament he said master
[35:21] I'm so excited that I've won the
[35:24] tournament and he says sir now I'm glad
[35:26] that you wanted to turn him into he said
[35:28] but I need to find out why it is that
[35:31] the the I'm winning all these matches he
[35:34] said all right I knew that the day would
[35:36] come that you would ask me so I'm gonna
[35:38] tell you he said the reason why you're
[35:41] winning all these matches is because
[35:43] that one move is all you need to look to
[35:46] know and the only way that your opponent
[35:50] is able to defend that one move is for
[35:52] them to grab your left arm and you don't
[35:56] have a left turn
[35:57] [Laughter]
[36:00] amen
[36:01] so what his his weakness became his
[36:04] strength amen
[36:06] so when you are weak you are strong amen
[36:10] I'm going through this in my life but
[36:12] you are strong he said that you are
[36:14] strong amen oh this is happening in my
[36:17] life but you are strong because the word
[36:19] said so Amen I'm sick I did this it but
[36:26] you are strong because the Lord has made
[36:27] a way for you amen so your weakness it
[36:33] doesn't matter what it is Satan will run
[36:35] a rub it all over your face your
[36:37] weakness but that weak through that
[36:40] weakness God to show the world hey

[37:08] to get her testimony be a purple mic
[37:22] yeah
[37:27] you can tell mommy's not around god
[37:39] bless you brothers and sisters it's
[37:41] great to be in the u.s. again and see
[37:43] all your smiling faces I just wanted to
[37:46] share a few experiences I had and in our
[37:49] mission trip and some things that I'm
[37:52] thankful for now there's some things
[37:54] that a lot of us take advantage of so
[37:59] four things that I am very thankful for
[38:02] now our smooth roads warm water flushing
[38:08] toilets and Wi-Fi because when you go to
[38:10] Honduras you're not gonna have Wi-Fi
[38:12] everywhere some experiences I had were
[38:17] feeding a monkey a brother took us on a
[38:21] boat ride to a few islands in Nicaragua
[38:25] and we fed a few monkeys over there and
[38:29] then another experience I had was being
[38:32] attacked by a dog this dog
[38:36] his trainer had taught it to protect its
[38:40] belongings and one thing that the owner
[38:45] had done that morning was he had skinned
[38:48] it he had skinned the sheep that morning
[38:50] which was going to be our lunch that
[38:52] afternoon after the youth service so I
[38:56] was gonna pass pass by there to go see
[39:00] the chickens at the time I didn't know
[39:03] that there was another way so the dog
[39:06] started chasing me and it bit my leg but
[39:09] thankfully I didn't get any cuts
[39:12] I just gave me a bruise things that were
[39:18] hard to adjust to were the roads the
[39:23] road where we went there weren't a lot
[39:25] of paved roads there were paved roads
[39:29] and every single time we got on one we
[39:31] were sick oh my goodness it's a paved
[39:33] road but mostly everywhere we went it
[39:38] was a dirt road
[39:39] and then it was also hard to adjust to
[39:42] where bathrooms
[39:45] it wasn't exactly a toilet it was you
[39:50] had to use a bucket of water to flush
[39:53] and they were heavy buckets when we went
[40:01] to the youth services there were
[40:03] multiple people there that had walked
[40:06] three or more hours to go to the youth
[40:10] services which lasted three days well it
[40:19] just really shows me how hungry people
[40:21] are for God's Word and what they'll do
[40:25] my dad went to preach there and I think
[40:28] he did a very good job and I believe
[40:31] that the people were blessed my favorite
[40:34] part of the trip well my main part
[40:37] my main favorite part of the trip was a
[40:40] mountain that we drove up to called some
[40:42] softball day when we got up there excuse
[40:47] me it was just very calming and quiet
[40:50] you didn't hear people singing karaoke
[40:52] everywhere you went it was just very
[40:56] quiet and then later that afternoon my
[40:59] dad was going to preach and when we got
[41:03] when we were driving it was just the
[41:06] roads were stones squished in together
[41:09] so they weren't exactly even so we were
[41:13] kind of bumping around all over the
[41:15] place in the truck and but when we got
[41:20] to the top where we were supposed to be
[41:22] it was worth it it was very very much
[41:25] worth it there's just two miracles that
[41:28] I wanted to share that happen there they
[41:31] may not seem big and something that
[41:35] people are gonna scream and shout about
[41:36] but it's something that's big to me
[41:39] there was one instance where the brother
[41:43] that we were staying with had lost his
[41:44] keys in the mall and my mom was just
[41:48] praying Lord we need these keys we can't
[41:50] get out of here without these keys and
[41:53] five minutes after my dad said that he
[41:55] had found the keys and then there was
[41:58] another instance where the brother that
[42:03] you helped get tires for new tires for
[42:07] his truck brother Eric there were many
[42:11] instances where his car would break down
[42:14] on the side of the road when we would
[42:16] have to go to a church or back to his
[42:18] house and whenever that would happen the
[42:22] brothers would try to fix it and
[42:23] whenever that would happen me and my mom
[42:26] and a sister and my sister would seeing
[42:32] me and my mom would sing when nothing
[42:34] but a miracle will do and by the time
[42:36] that song ended the car was the car we
[42:40] started again where it was as if it had
[42:45] gotten a new battery and I believe that
[42:50] it's just it just shows me that God's
[42:52] and God's never gonna forget you even if
[42:56] you're just on the side of the road
[42:57] where no one's gonna help you so Zoey
[42:59] just wants to share a little story that
[43:02] she had and then we'll pass it on to my
[43:04] dad
[43:14] all right you wanted to share about
[43:17] monkey all right Thank You Bella Thank
[43:21] You Zoe hey man oh yeah this was this
[43:37] was the first trip that Zoe took outside
[43:42] of North America she's been to Canada
[43:45] but you know going to Canada like going
[43:47] he was being here in the States but uh
[43:50] Bella she's been in the Philippines and
[43:52] she's been to my country so she's seen
[43:55] things that like that she's seen how
[43:57] third-world countries look and the way
[44:00] they live but she hadn't been in a while
[44:03] and so I wanted to take her and so uh it
[44:05] was it was some things were very
[44:07] eye-opening to her and it's definitely
[44:10] for Zoey when you might ask what you
[44:13] wanted why do you want to take your
[44:14] children you know what one of the best
[44:16] things I could probably give them is an
[44:17] experience like that you know they're
[44:20] you know sometimes you know we get so
[44:24] acclimated to this life here and it's us
[44:27] four and no more and and but when you
[44:30] see outside of the shell and you see
[44:33] what other people are going through like
[44:35] walk in three hours to church you you
[44:38] look at things back home a bit
[44:39] differently and I think it's good for
[44:41] young people to see those and to
[44:43] experience that have those experiences
[44:45] you know because you know it'll help
[44:48] them later on I believe in their
[44:50] Christian walk you know help them maybe
[44:53] kind of keep them humble kind of keep
[44:55] the meek and and just just I wanted them
[45:00] to experience that so hopefully the Lord
[45:02] gives give them more opportunities amen
[45:04] that way amen
[45:06] so I guess the brothers that they can
[45:10] start with the with the first
[45:14] amen so this time around what we did is
[45:19] we drove all the way to Miami from from
[45:21] Atlanta and Oh from our home about a 10
[45:26] hour drive so we flew out from the
[45:29] airport and down to Nicaragua and of
[45:33] course this is Central America
[45:35] Mexico's right here Nicaragua is all the
[45:38] way down here just right above Costa
[45:41] Rica so next and this is where this is
[45:45] this is Nicaragua this is Managua which
[45:48] is the capital and this is Honduras this
[45:53] is pretty much everywhere we traveled
[45:55] the whole it's in miles III I'm not sure
[46:03] exactly in miles of it a lot of pilots
[46:05] that we traveled but we mainly tried to
[46:08] concentrate in on the southern part of
[46:11] Honduras now the brother the brother
[46:13] brother Donald oh that's preached for us
[46:15] here from Honduras he's preached for us
[46:17] twice he's from right there La Ceiba
[46:19] that's where he's from couldn't make it
[46:22] all the way up there but next time Lord
[46:24] willing we might we'd like to take a go
[46:29] go through the northern part of Honduras
[46:31] hey man next so this is uh this is in
[46:36] Miami next and right right in Miami we
[46:41] hadn't even left the country yet and it
[46:42] was already food this was that at a Ruby
[46:50] Tuesday's parking lot they were just
[46:53] there just walking all over the place
[46:55] iguanas everywhere and I think brother
[46:57] Joe mentioned to me that there's there
[46:59] there are a lot of them down there in
[47:00] Florida so that was just uh what was to
[47:04] come
[47:05] I had next so there's a picture of the
[47:10] flight next and we were about to land in
[47:14] Nicaragua next so when we got there the
[47:18] brother that that was what state picked
[47:20] us up from the airport took us to this
[47:22] place to just eat these little I forgot
[47:25] what they call them was basically it's
[47:27] everything in
[47:28] and in a bag and you just kind of suck
[47:30] suck it suck it and there's cheese in it
[47:32] and all kinds of stuff he's like this
[47:34] hopefully this will keep you until we
[47:36] get to our destination which is about
[47:38] two hours away so that's what we were
[47:41] eating next and Zoey was drinking it was
[47:46] they call it cacao but it's really it's
[47:48] like cold chocolate because it's very
[47:51] hot down there in Managua Nicaragua a 95
[47:54] degree weather it's just very it's just
[47:56] a usual everyday drinking out of a bag
[47:59] and Zoey asked she wondered today not
[48:02] have cups in Nicaragua
[48:06] but that's what they give it to they'll
[48:08] just give you the drink in a bag and
[48:10] would put a straw in it and that's I
[48:13] guess it saves them more money that way
[48:15] next so the next day when we got to
[48:18] Chien and Agra which is the city they're
[48:21] in in in in Nicaragua
[48:24] the next day we ministered at this
[48:26] brothers church and brother our brother
[48:31] Nielson Romero and next
[48:42] [Music]
[48:48] [Music]
[48:49] I was just kind of healing much
[48:51] yesterday a little bit yes next all
[48:57] right so after the service we had we had
[49:00] prayer prayer requests I'm in a prayer
[49:04] line and several of the sisters came up
[49:06] for prayer we took we took the prayer
[49:10] cloths and we we were able to take all
[49:15] the prayer cloths and spread them out
[49:17] through all the different places that we
[49:18] went to so we only gave certain certain
[49:22] amount to each ones and we told them hey
[49:24] look you can still even cut these pieces
[49:25] so they did that so we this is the
[49:29] pastor right here and he's 28 years old
[49:33] young young man but he's he's laboring
[49:37] next so we put this picture in here Zoey

[49:43] Zoey's went and saw a broom she would
[49:45] pick it up and just start sweeping this

[57:21] almost everywhere where you where you go
[57:23] this is how it is cows everywhere and in
[57:27] the middle just walking dogs and things
[57:32] yeah that's good
[57:34] all right so when we got there this is
[57:37] some of the ministers that were there
[57:39] the pastors at this week-long pastors
[57:42] ministers meetings that were they were
[57:44] gonna have in the morning it was
[57:46] ministers meetings further for three of
[57:49] three or four days they were gonna have
[57:50] about four sessions in the evening times
[57:53] I'm sorry there was two services for the
[57:56] ministers meetings every day and then in
[57:59] the evening times it was a van gistic
[58:01] service under a tent and I was there
[58:05] that was the first day I was supposed to
[58:07] speak that night at that evangelistic
[58:09] meeting under the tent so next
[58:14] [Music]
[58:33] that's like Christine she they got
[58:36] started seeing a special turn it up for
[58:40] their hands
[58:46] [Music]
[58:51] can't tell she's singing in Spanish
[58:55] so I asked she asked me she said what
[58:58] song should I sing and I said well sing
[58:59] this one and she learned it Spanish so I
[59:15] used to like walking around with my with
[59:18] my sagging pants trying to try to get
[59:23] girls I see your dad and I used a rapper
[59:44] [Applause]
[59:58] well brother Eric his wife does too this
[1:00:03] is where I did an example of take the
[1:00:05] book from Revelation 10 Bela went and
[1:00:08] grabbed it
[1:00:10] [Laughter]
[1:00:19] and she took advantage because I was at
[1:00:22] the edge of the pulpit I had already
[1:00:24] gotten some other at the edge of the
[1:00:25] platform on man I was added ready told
[1:00:28] him some of the brothers they of course
[1:00:30] they didn't take it you know but she she
[1:00:32] knew the deal all right this is the the
[1:00:57] following morning at the ministers
[1:00:59] meeting this is Juana this is pastors
[1:01:02] and ministers throughout just the
[1:01:03] southern part of the Honduras I don't
[1:01:07] know it was at least maybe I don't know
[1:01:09] 100 200 people maybe 150 I don't know
[1:01:12] but I'll and you know what I like is
[1:01:16] that they all have fellowship with one
[1:01:17] another and that's that's one thing that
[1:01:20] they do try to respect each other and
[1:01:22] they may not agree in everything but
[1:01:25] they at least try to respect each other
[1:01:26] and they try to fellowship each other
[1:01:28] with that with each other and everything
[1:01:31] that's I was wonderful to see next some
[1:01:36] of these also were not just from
[1:01:37] Honduras but they're from El Salvador
[1:01:40] and also from Nicaragua as well
[1:01:42] next and there's Christine that night
[1:01:47] she was helping cooking in the little
[1:01:49] little stove there that they had next
[1:01:57] car ride a little girl that that was
[1:02:00] with us
[1:02:02] her name is Ivana
[1:02:06] so Zoe's own that she that's the thing
[1:02:11] with Zoe when she's owned then just
[1:02:13] don't bother her you know she's owned in

[1:02:17] next all right so the following day we
[1:02:22] had to go the sisters were constantly
[1:02:26] all day long just making meals because
[1:02:29] the sessions for the brothers ministers
[1:02:31] the ministry brothers was all day long

[1:02:36] Christine helping them cook next

[1:02:43] is a chicken feet soup
[1:02:46] and it's it was very good next water
[1:02:53] they they constantly just use water in
[1:02:55] little bags so it's it's a filtered
[1:02:58] water purified water but they just
[1:03:00] cheapest thing instead of just having
[1:03:02] bottles you know next day I want to show
[1:03:07] you this brother this brother he's about
[1:03:09] your same age brother right here and he
[1:03:12] was one of the first ones he came into
[1:03:14] message around 67 68 as well and he was
[1:03:18] one of the first ones to his mom was the
[1:03:21] first one to receive one of the first
[1:03:22] ones to received a message in Honduras
[1:03:26] so and that he's he's related to him as
[1:03:30] well so he sure does yeah it's an Eagle
[1:03:35] Eagle belt buckle yeah he's one of the
[1:03:43] veterans next and the brother he the
[1:03:47] brother is related to him he had broken
[1:03:50] his arm messed up his arm and it was
[1:03:53] still in the process of healing
[1:03:54] something similar to what you did
[1:03:55] brother Aaron and so we were just
[1:03:58] praying for the brother next this is
[1:04:02] brother Aldo and he's another one of the
[1:04:04] veterans in the message here old timer
[1:04:07] he invited me to speak in his church and
[1:04:09] the brothers told me brothers told me
[1:04:12] he's like I can't believe I can't
[1:04:13] believe he invited you to speak I didn't
[1:04:15] even invite him we're Hondurans
[1:04:17] you don't invite Harley nobody and but
[1:04:21] you know I thank God that you know you
[1:04:23] found grace in the eyes of these people
[1:04:26] you know and look I didn't get to visit
[1:04:29] his church then get to visit his people
[1:04:31] but Lord willing maybe next time next
[1:04:34] all right this is one of the area's head
[1:04:38] into that place where where the meetings
[1:04:40] were gonna be held that next some more
[1:04:43] food cooking there next there's a more
[1:04:47] chicken feet next all right I wanted to
[1:04:51] talk about this right next to the the
[1:04:53] church there where they were held into
[1:04:55] ministers meetings and all there's this
[1:04:57] little house right there next to it very
[1:04:59] common to see this is a house and the
[1:05:04] the lady that lives here has four
[1:05:05] children her husband was one he was he
[1:05:08] was one of the ones who went on one on
[1:05:11] this Caravan that that walking up to try
[1:05:14] to get to the United States and he came
[1:05:17] back with a broken arm but you can see
[1:05:24] why people do the things they do I mean
[1:05:26] I'm not here about political things you
[1:05:27] know it but things are hard down there
[1:05:30] and but so my wife I wasn't there but my
[1:05:36] wife felt led to give her some money and
[1:05:38] some of the money that was donated amen
[1:05:42] to us we were able to give her some
[1:05:44] money because the only things she has no
[1:05:46] note no income coming in and she just
[1:05:48] sells tortillas out in the streets her
[1:05:51] husband can't work so at the moment but
[1:05:54] it has four children to to raise so next
[1:06:00] this is another part of their home next
[1:06:04] this is her right there with with her
[1:06:06] and so she's she's she's allowing this
[1:06:10] is her oldest daughter she's allowing as
[1:06:12] she lets them come to the church and
[1:06:13] visit the church she she hasn't come yet
[1:06:16] but but I believe the Lord is doing a
[1:06:19] work in her so long but it was thankful
[1:06:22] that Christine was there and that she
[1:06:24] was able to you know to minister to her
[1:06:26] in that way
[1:06:26] maybe might have done something that
[1:06:28] heard that maybe she started going to
[1:06:30] church now I don't know but next all
[1:06:33] right this is the next night of the
[1:06:35] meetings there was buses just lined up
[1:06:38] from different parts of fun of Honduras
[1:06:40] coming to the tenth meeting next next
[1:06:46] and this is the the second or third
[1:06:50] night it was probably about close to a
[1:06:52] thousand people there that night next
[1:06:55] and this is afterwards that after this
[1:06:58] after that long day of doing all that
[1:07:01] they're in the meetings this is what
[1:07:03] happens we were supposed to be eating
[1:07:06] there at a little eatery but Zoey just
[1:07:09] she was ready to sleep next all right so
[1:07:14] we visited another brother in the area
[1:07:17] where my Bello was talking about so
[1:07:19] inside bought then and he's pretty much
[1:07:24] up in the mountains but it's very it's
[1:07:27] very beautiful up there and we had
[1:07:30] service with them next on the way there
[1:07:32] we stopped and we saw these these
[1:07:35] critters and they gave us I told her
[1:07:39] brother I said one why don't you go
[1:07:40] ahead and get him he said I just stopped
[1:07:43] so that the girls could see him I didn't
[1:07:44] well I didn't think you were gonna want
[1:07:46] again I said yeah by him so the little
[1:07:48] boy you know probably like 14 years old
[1:07:51] he said I'll sell them to you I'll even
[1:07:52] skin him for you and everything I'll
[1:07:54] prepare him here for you so it's kind of
[1:07:56] like the hunters drive-through you know
[1:07:58] you know you're right there and they
[1:08:02] they cut the heads everything well you
[1:08:04] got another video that I didn't put it
[1:08:06] on here but but they prepared it right
[1:08:08] there for you but this is next next oh I
[1:08:14] thought it was a picture an image there
[1:08:16] I thought I'd put it there but it was a
[1:08:18] look that Bella and Zoey had while the
[1:08:20] boy was skinny I mean he was skinning
[1:08:22] the the with his teeth and everything
[1:08:24] taking the skin off the iguanas and but
[1:08:28] we were gonna we were gonna eat him that
[1:08:30] night when we got to the to the place
[1:08:33] that afternoon this is the church will
[1:08:35] revisited grace Tabernacle next brother
[1:08:38] Carlos ketose
[1:08:40] is the pastor there next this isn't from
[1:08:43] inside the church next which I'm pretty
[1:08:57] much the same thing that I was
[1:08:58] ministering to you all this afternoon
[1:09:00] and it seemed then we had a wonderful
[1:09:03] people coming up for prayer we give
[1:09:06] prayer cloths as well a man next that's
[1:09:10] brother Carlos right here the pastor and
[1:09:12] his he I found out he told me that his
[1:09:16] son that lives in Jacksonville Florida
[1:09:18] he and I got in touch with him but while
[1:09:21] I was there in Honduras and that's the
[1:09:23] reason why I stopped by in the
[1:09:25] Jacksonville and it was to visit his son
[1:09:28] and then I ended up preaching there too
[1:09:30] on the way here so next this is what the
[1:09:35] area where we were we were at the
[1:09:37] brothers house they may not have a lot
[1:09:40] but you can't beat stuff like this you
[1:09:44] know and they pretty much was interested
[1:09:47] they pretty much live off the grid they
[1:09:50] don't pay for electricity they don't pay
[1:09:51] for nothing they grow their own food

[1:17:00] from them next this is the day of the
[1:17:03] dedication a lot of people came now see
[1:17:06] a lot of the people that came were
[1:17:09] people not even believers that lived
[1:17:12] around the community to the church
[1:17:14] dedication so they're having an effect
[1:17:17] on the people when the brother when the
[1:17:19] brothers were building this church the
[1:17:21] people thought the the people were were
[1:17:25] you know they were other churches around
[1:17:28] the area and stuff we're criticizing
[1:17:29] them and people were criticizing them
[1:17:32] and so when the church started getting
[1:17:34] built it was no work nothing happening
[1:17:36] for a while but then all of a sudden the
[1:17:38] church started getting you know when we
[1:17:40] when we helped put the roof up and all
[1:17:42] that all that it started getting built
[1:17:44] faster and so the people around there in
[1:17:47] the community thought that there were
[1:17:48] witches because of them why is this work
[1:17:52] speeding up so much but but some people
[1:17:55] even from other churches you see the
[1:17:57] ladies wearing the veils there that are
[1:18:00] coming in so you pray for that little
[1:18:02] brother for their brother Eric and that
[1:18:04] church there next

[1:18:31] from from Nicaragua was the one who

[1:18:47] all the ministers in the church we
[1:18:49] dedicated the pulpit for the Lord next
[1:18:52] and then some of the people from the
[1:18:54] congregation came up from his
[1:18:56] congregation and we prayed for them as
[1:18:59] well next there's we were there middle
[1:19:04] prayer next these two brother Pedro and
[1:19:07] sister Maria they're very I guess their
[1:19:10] pillars in the church they've been very

[1:19:54] who has a program of one one-hour
[1:19:56] program at the radio station he asked me

[1:20:09] there at the mountains this is the
[1:20:11] pastor there at the church and this is
[1:20:14] the tire wearing boots and

[1:20:22] we just got out of the truck from
[1:20:24] traveling
[1:20:25] I wasn't ministering that night this is
[1:20:27] when I had just gotten I was sick with a
[1:20:29] cold so I couldn't minister and I had
[1:20:31] asked another brother to minister for me
[1:20:33] and that's brother island he was the one
[1:20:39] to minister that night the the heavyset
[1:20:41] brother that was with us from Nicaragua
[1:20:43] and as he was ministering next the power
[1:20:47] goes out so there's no problem people
[1:20:50] just take their flow flashlights and
[1:20:52] whatever if they had phones and we just
[1:20:55] kept having church next the next day I
[1:20:59] preached and as you can see the mirror
[1:21:01] right here so you kind of know what I
[1:21:04] ministered to them about that morning
[1:21:06] next this is some of the youth that went
[1:21:15] to the to the to the meet meetings there
[1:21:17] that week that youth camp this is their
[1:21:19] first youth camp that they had in that
[1:21:21] region and so for that for it to be the
[1:21:24] first one you know it was it was a it
[1:21:26] was a good amount of people and some of
[1:21:28] these people travelled about three hours
[1:21:30] by foot to get to this place the church
[1:21:34] is in the middle of the woods you can
[1:21:36] see next

[1:21:53] sessions as well with the young people
[1:21:55] the first session that we had with them
[1:21:58] they we asked them questions and one of
[1:22:01] the questions that we ask them is what
[1:22:04] is the Holy Ghost and then the other one
[1:22:06] is what is the new birth
[1:22:08] what does it does it mean to be born
[1:22:09] again obviously they're both taught with
[1:22:12] each other but it's very interesting to
[1:22:15] get you know to get the responses from
[1:22:17] some of the young people they're you
[1:22:19] know they're they're knowledgeable in
[1:22:22] the word and I was I was pretty
[1:22:24] impressed but I was able to give each
[1:22:27] one of us as the ministers gave our you
[1:22:30] know little two cents I guess on what it
[1:22:33] was to us next and then the next day
[1:22:38] also we had they we asked they asked us
[1:22:41] questions so we had question and answers
[1:22:42] and they asked us questions and it
[1:22:44] wasn't questions you know silly

[1:22:59] that the brothers would sleep on they
[1:23:02] just kind of spread them out me that's
[1:23:05] where they would sleep on next next I
[1:23:10] don't know what happened there supposed

[1:23:14] where we've stayed at and this is the
[1:23:15] driveway brothers a brothers truck
[1:23:21] almost got stuck there several times

[1:23:45] in this bag I wasn't preaching those you
[1:23:48] know those were just to come walk around
[1:23:49] but then I changed right before I come
[1:23:52] to the pulpit next
[1:23:55] next next all right this is what us
[1:24:02] pushing the brother Eric's truck because
[1:24:05] the battery ran out the juice on this
[1:24:08] battery had had that batter the juice on
[1:24:12] that battery had run out like eight
[1:24:14] months ago and he and he said this is
[1:24:17] his testimony he said lord I don't have
[1:24:19] any money do you gonna have to do
[1:24:22] something and the and his and that
[1:24:25] battery just came back having the
[1:24:27] battery just worked for another eight
[1:24:28] months until we got there and so when we
[1:24:31] got there we bought him a brand new
[1:24:33] battery and well that's what we had to
[1:24:38] do in the meantime while we were up in
[1:24:41] the mountains where there was not much
[1:24:42] not much recent no many reach so many
[1:24:45] resources until we got back to the city
[1:24:47] where we were able to buy him the
[1:24:49] battery next bunch we were this sister
[1:25:01] after one of the services we had with
[1:25:03] them their sister came up she has four
[1:25:06] or five children and and started

[1:25:18] we even go actually after where she said
[1:25:21] you know what the Lord had told me that

[1:25:27] was crying so next and then another day
[1:25:33] I went into the radio station again and
[1:25:35] that preacher another 30 minutes
[1:25:37] I really enjoyed I don't know how many
[1:25:45] listeners were listening
[1:25:48] whether I got eaten for his son and Lee
[1:25:53] though they're brothers that handle the
[1:25:55] church their next

[1:27:20] outside next to the bathrooms next and
[1:27:28] then the day before we left we
[1:27:32] administered at another place it was
[1:27:34] kind of you had to walk several steps to
[1:27:36] get to their church next and this is a
[1:27:41] little place where we ministered at next
[1:27:48] daddy and the off cie and then we had we
[1:27:54] pray for a prayer cloths and we pray for

[1:28:04] Zoe she's talking to one of the little
[1:28:08] girls there I don't know if you all
[1:28:16] remember the church right before I left
[1:28:18] this is we're almost done that right
[1:28:22] before I left I met I mentioned the
[1:28:23] church that I was trying to help raise
[1:28:26] money for them this is the church that
[1:28:28] that that it's in Nicaragua brother
[1:28:33] Manuel is the pastor and and so they
[1:28:37] they've got they've got it all right
[1:28:39] almost finished
[1:28:40] next next this is the inside they've got
[1:28:46] a good sized congregation so they were
[1:28:49] building it this is pretty nice inside
[1:28:54] next next next
[1:28:59] and so after leaving Honduras Nicaragua
[1:29:02] on January the 4th January the 6th I
[1:29:08] believe it was which is a Sunday I
[1:29:10] stopped in Jacksonville Florida this is
[1:29:12] brother Carlos the brother in Honduras
[1:29:15] this is his son and that's met with him
[1:29:18] and then he's like hey I would like for
[1:29:21] us to speak at our church so he talked
[1:29:23] to his pastor and I was I spoke at their
[1:29:25] church that Sunday next a so throughout
[1:29:46] the whole trip Saints I ministered
[1:29:47] probably about 18 different services and
[1:29:51] and that's not can't well yeah that's
[1:29:53] counting the times that I spoke on the
[1:29:55] radio and and so I what I told the
[1:30:02] brothers I didn't get to baptize anybody
[1:30:03] we didn't have any baptisms or anything
[1:30:05] like that we got to see some lives
[1:30:08] affected by the word but what I told her
[1:30:09] brother and I said listen all I do is
[1:30:12] just like Paul said we go and just
[1:30:14] preach the word the pastor's water the
[1:30:18] minister's their water but the God is
[1:30:20] the one who gives the increase amen
[1:30:22] so we appreciate all of your prayers and
[1:30:24] we appreciate everything that you all
[1:30:26] did for us the offerings and everybody
[1:30:29] is so appreciative of it and without
[1:30:31] without you all in and then your prayers
[1:30:34] and I knew we wouldn't be able to make
[1:30:36] it through and thank you so much and
[1:30:38] Lord bless you all you and that's it
[1:30:40] right there
[1:30:44] [Applause]
[1:30:48] go down you want to come up I don't okay
[1:30:52] all right so I listen to our feet sure
[1:31:01] let's have the musicians come up
[1:31:08] obviously there's a you know there's
[1:31:11] invitations to go other places they're
[1:31:14] around the country but you can only do
[1:31:16] so much you know
[1:31:18] so we'll see when the Lord allows us to
[1:31:21] visit them again but it's there's so
[1:31:27] much work to do one of the things I
[1:31:29] wanted to mention is that you know it's
[1:31:31] easy to go and even though there's you
[1:31:35] know you go through some rough terrain
[1:31:36] you experienced some very difficult
[1:31:38] things but you're preaching to already
[1:31:43] established churches for the most part
[1:31:45] but there's brothers there in Lord
[1:31:48] willing you know I'd like to join up
[1:31:50] with them and there's brothers there
[1:31:51] that go to places where the gospel
[1:31:53] hasn't even reached to them you know and
[1:31:56] so you pray for these these brothers
[1:32:00] Lord willing next time I go that's where
[1:32:02] we're gonna be going and there'll be
[1:32:04] they travel they travel far like there's
[1:32:06] like you know it's easy for people from
[1:32:08] America to come and preach you know at
[1:32:11] established churches but I want we want
[1:32:13] the gospel to be preached to people
[1:32:14] hadn't even heard about Jesus Christ and
[1:32:17] so lord will and that's what we want we
[1:32:19] want to do and I'd love to be able to be
[1:32:23] able to support these brothers that go
[1:32:24] out you know to these different remote
[1:32:27] I'm in mountainous areas where there's
[1:32:29] still Mindy and Indian tribes that live
[1:32:32] there and so you pray for those people
[1:32:35] because there's still places that still
[1:32:38] have not heard about the Lord Jesus
[1:32:40] Christ that still need the Lord amen so
[1:32:43] let's just bow our heads and then we'll
[1:32:46] have brother brother boy sing something
[1:32:48] for us our Heavenly Father thank you
[1:32:50] Lord for the opportunity to that you've
[1:32:52] given us Lord to minister your word and
