[35:41] thy name that stirreth up himself to
[35:44] take hold of thee for thou has hid thy
[35:47] face from us and has consumed us because
[35:51] of our iniquities may the Lord add His

[36:37] in this Tabernacle to stir you up by
[36:40] putting you in
[36:42] remembrance by putting you in
[36:43] remembrance then again second Peter
[36:46] chter 3 and verse one says it like this
[36:50] this uh send this Second Epistle beloved
[36:53] I now write unto you in both which I
[36:56] stir up your pure mind
[36:58] by way of remembrance and that's what I
[37:00] want to do this morning as we stir
[37:03] ourselves and take on the scripture says
[37:05] there's none that stir theirself up and
[37:08] take hold upon God but I want to take
[37:10] hold upon God this morning I was talking

[37:52] to say that it some things don't cause
[37:54] us to do anything but to set and and
[37:57] just staring whatever you remember uh
[37:59] there's a little boy that her her her
[38:01] mother just fell over the counter his

[40:10] that word of
[40:13] God said so holy that the angels look
[40:16] filthy the Angels before him are
[40:18] filthy I thought
[40:21] my let me read that again if I can if I
[40:24] may I'll be Amplified
[40:29] it says for we all become as one who is
[40:32] unclean ceremony like a leper and all

[40:56] away for far from God's
[40:59] favor this morning I want God's favor
[41:03] I'm sure that's what you want this
[41:05] morning it's God's favor yes sir but it
[41:08] says our iniquities what is that knowing
[41:11] to do something and not doing it or
[41:12] knowing not to do something and still
[41:14] doing it said our iniquities like the
[41:16] wind is taking us away far from God's

[41:39] for you have hidden your face from
[41:41] us and have delivered us into the

[50:44] Nest
[50:46] 1960 said it's Nest stirring
[50:49] time the Pentecostal church needs a nest
[50:54] stirring it needs an oldfashioned reval
[50:56] Bal like he spoke up of Jacob he was app
[51:00] of his eye he done wrong but he found
[51:03] him in the wilderness and he's like an
[51:06] eagle stirring her nest he carried Jacob
[51:09] on his wings he says amen the church has
[51:12] done wrong we've all done wrong but
[51:15] we're the apple of his eye he's ready to
[51:18] stir the nest
[51:19] tonight send the Holy Ghost in and Shake
[51:22] all the feathers

[51:27] Alama Valley that'll warn the nation
[51:30] he'll do it as an eagle stir up her nest
[51:33] and FLIR FLIR furth over her young and
[51:37] taketh them up on her wings and bears
[51:38] them up in the air he said so did he

[51:43] people amen that's it God's in
[51:45] inheritance is his people he told Moses
[51:48] said I'm your portion so I believe it's

[51:53] morning so let me just mention this to
[51:56] you
[52:01] sin you know what brother Braham said

[52:13] right said
[52:15] sin broke it down said what is sin
[52:20] transgression what's transgression an
[52:23] overstepping of the
[52:25] law how many many of us has
[52:28] transgressed and overstepping the law
[52:31] the Divine boundary between good and
[52:34] evil how means us
[52:37] transgress
[52:38] iniquity an act inherently wrong whether
[52:44] especially forbidden or
[52:47] not
[52:49] era a departure from

[53:30] trespass the
[53:32] wrongful entering of
[53:38] self-will in Divine
[53:41] Authority the wrongful

[53:57] in the way our own will has destroyed a
[54:01] lot of us our own will has destroyed a
[54:04] lot of moms and dads right right our own
[54:08] will has destroyed a lot of young people
[54:10] we want our own will instead of saying
[54:13] God help me you remember he had a will
[54:15] but in the garden he had to pray not my
[54:18] will but thy will be done God that's
[54:21] what I want remember when the disciples
[54:23] came to him and said Lord teach us how
[54:25] to pray he said our father I want him to
[54:29] be my father this morning our father and

[55:20] words absent of
[55:22] government hey God's got a law he's got
[55:25] a government
[55:27] you remember in the Bible in the Old
[55:28] Testament how they had a law how to tear
[55:31] the Tabernacle down how to set it up
[55:33] where every tribe should be and when
[55:36] they put when they had to pull it up and
[55:38] March how many feet they were supposed
[55:40] to walk behind it God has he still has a
[55:43] law but sometimes we don't want God's
[55:47] law help us Lord llness
[55:51] unbelief and insult of divine truth
[55:57] sin can only be Remedy by the
[56:00] sacrificial death of
[56:04] Christ what is sin it may be summarized
[56:07] as
[56:08] threefold number one an act of violation
[56:12] of our lack of obedience to the revealed
[56:16] word of
[56:20] God number two a state which actually
[56:23] means a condition because Paul said
[56:25] whatever state or whatever condition I
[56:27] find myself
[56:29] in I will praise the Lord I will give
[56:33] him glory whatever state and then and he
[56:36] said sin can be summarized as this a Act
[56:37] of violation of or lack of obedience to
[56:40] the revealed word of God number two a
[56:41] state absence of righteousness or number
[56:44] three a nature which is enity toward God
