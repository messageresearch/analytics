[0:00] dear father Lord we thank you for this
[0:01] day Lord thank you for allowing us to
[0:02] gather together as Believers Lord just

[0:06] and and to search your word search your
[0:08] scriptures with o people like Precious
[0:10] Faith Lord to lift each other up Lord
[0:12] that we each bring our own lick of fire
[0:13] lord and just add to the the fire lord
[0:15] and just pray that you forgive us of all
[0:17] our sins Lord pray for all the prayer
[0:18] requests Lord those who are down lord
[0:21] lift them up Lord those who are sick
[0:22] heal them Lord pray for those who can't
[0:24] be there Lord just pray that they'll be
[0:25] back with us soon pray for those
[0:28] traveling Lord and just pray for all
[0:29] things in your part precious name of
[0:31] Jesus Christ I pray amen amen if you
[0:35] have your scriptures today we can turn
[0:37] to um John chapter
[0:42] 9 give your Bible today everyone sit
[0:48] down all
[0:50] right still getting into the flow of
[0:55] things so John chapter 9 verse one
[1:01] and as Jesus passed by he saw a man
[1:05] which was blind from his birth and his
[1:07] disciples asked him saying master who
[1:09] did Sin this man or his parents that he
[1:12] was born blind Jesus answered neither
[1:15] hath this man sinned nor his parents but
[1:18] that the works of God should be made
[1:20] manifest in
[1:21] him so sometimes we wonder you know why
[1:24] do things happen why are there trials
[1:27] why why why are bad things happening to
[1:28] people and the Believers but God is
[1:31] saying that no one sinned no no one
[1:33] sinned that this man should should be
[1:35] born blind but it's simply that the
[1:37] works of God will be made manifest in
[1:38] him so it's no one's fault you know he
[1:41] who sined that maybe you would have
[1:42] diabetes who sined that you would suffer
[1:44] from this Affliction who sined that
[1:45] maybe you'd have depression who sinned
[1:47] that you know you would have have high
[1:48] blood pressure who sinned that these
[1:50] things would come upon us that people
[1:51] were getting car ACD and car wxs and who
[1:53] sin that these things would happen and
[1:55] it's that nobody sinned you know nobody
[1:56] sinned it's just that the works of God
[1:58] be made manifest in you and through our
[2:00] struggles that is how God will make his
[2:02] work manifest you know like like brother
[2:04] Brenham said you know he has to he has
[2:06] to display his attributes he couldn't
[2:07] save if there was no one lost he
[2:09] couldn't heal if there was no one sick
[2:12] you know and and the question is asked
[2:14] who sinned and it might be the same
[2:15] person who sinned when job was
[2:17] persecuted and there was no one who
[2:19] sinned when job was persecuted job was
[2:21] job was challenged by the devil the
[2:23] devil said God put a hedge around him
[2:25] and that's why job was righteous because
[2:27] job was in a in a place of you know he
[2:29] had wealth he had children he had a wife
[2:32] he he had many things that made life you
[2:34] know better on him easier on him and
[2:36] made made the Troubles of life you know
[2:38] seem maybe a little more distant than it
[2:40] was for the other people and so the
[2:42] devil calls this out and says well
[2:43] there's a hedge around him of course
[2:45] he's righteous but when
[2:46] job when job lost his his cattle he was
[2:49] righteous still and when job lost his
[2:51] money he was righteous still when his
[2:53] sons died when his children died he was
[2:55] righteous still when his wife said Curse
[2:57] God and die he was still righteous when
[2:59] his friends rebuked him he was still
[3:01] righteous so don't be surprised when
[3:03] these things happen to you don't don't
[3:05] be in shock you know we know we're
[3:06] children of God we know this is a war
[3:08] this is not a lunch table this is not a
[3:11] picnic this is a battlefield so don't be
[3:13] surprised and and maintain your
[3:15] righteousness God is testing you he's
[3:17] going to see how you react you know and
[3:19] and maybe he said you know have you
[3:20] considered my servant and maybe that's
[3:22] why he's things were happening so that
[3:24] you can prove yourself as a Believer the
[3:26] same way that God must manifest his
[3:28] attributes when someone is L he is to
[3:30] save them when someone is sick he must
[3:32] heal them well if you're a Christian
[3:34] when you go through a trial you have to
[3:35] prove that you're a Christian you have
[3:36] to prove that your faith is stronger
[3:38] than your trial that your faith in God
[3:40] is going to take you through this you
[3:42] will overcome through this so it's going
[3:45] to be it's going to be God working in
[3:46] you and and manifesting those those his
[3:48] Works in you through what you suffer and
[3:50] through the trials that you go through
[3:52] and let's turn to Ecclesiastes chapter 7
[4:23] eclesiastes chapter
[4:27] 7 verse three
[4:30] sorrow is better than laughter for by
[4:32] the sadness of the countenance The Heart
[4:34] Is Made better the heart of the wise is
[4:37] in the house of mourning but the heart
[4:39] of fools is in the house of Mirth it is
[4:42] better to hear the rebuke of the wise
[4:44] than for a man to hear the song of fools
[4:47] so this is it can be a strange scripture
[4:49] to read Because typically you know as
[4:51] humans we always want to have a joy you
[4:53] always to have laughter we want to have
[4:54] good time and you know it is a good time
[4:56] to get around Believers in Fellowship
[4:58] but you know sometimes having a good
[5:01] time and laughing isn't what's going to
[5:03] perfect us that's not what's that's not
[5:04] what's going to edify us it's going to
[5:06] build us up you know and and even you
[5:08] think of uh that's that's where all your
[5:10] character is built it's through it's
[5:12] through the things you go through you
[5:13] know parents often say that expression
[5:14] you know it it builds character when
[5:16] your kids are going through something
[5:17] you say well it's okay it builds
[5:19] character so there's things that they go
[5:20] through where it's like well that that's
[5:22] actually going to help them become a
[5:23] more mature person CU if they don't go
[5:25] through anything you know they're going
[5:27] to end up spoiled and rotten and and the
[5:29] Bible says you know you spare the rod
[5:30] and you spoil the child you know and God
[5:32] is our father so he's not going to he's
[5:34] not going to spare the rod he's not
[5:35] going to spoil us so that we cannot be
[5:38] perfected you know he wants us to come
[5:39] to Perfection he wants us to grow up to
[5:41] grow to
[5:42] maturity so he's not going to spread the
[5:44] rod he's not going to go easy on us he's
[5:45] not going to but also won't tempt us
[5:48] Beyond what's common of man as the Bible
[5:49] says he's not going to tempt us beyond
[5:51] what we can handle beyond what we can go
[5:53] to him for and seek strength from him
[5:55] for so he's never going to to tempt us
[5:57] or or or you know rock the boat some so
[5:59] much that we we fall over and we capsize
[6:01] he's always going to keep us right in
[6:03] line with how we're supposed to be and
[6:05] and even that scripture you know sorrow
[6:09] you know the house of Mirth and you
[6:10] think of you know the house of Mirth and
[6:12] mirth is essentially just happiness or
[6:15] laughter or or maybe a comedy show or
[6:17] mirth is is that kind of
[6:19] Celebration or or activity you
[6:21] participate in where everything's
[6:22] everything's fine everything's good you
[6:24] know everything's great and you're just
[6:25] in the house of Mirth and and that's
[6:27] where that's where that's where the
[6:29] world is at you know and sometimes you
[6:30] see people doing what they doing we know
[6:32] it's pride month and we know there's all
[6:34] these different things going on and
[6:35] that's the house of merth they being
[6:36] people are being told what they want to
[6:38] hear and not what they need to hear but
[6:40] when you come to the word of God it's
[6:41] going to tell you what you need to hear
[6:42] even if it's an uncomfortable truth even
[6:44] if it stirs you up even if it it really
[6:47] Pricks your heart it's that's what it's
[6:48] was supposed to do you know cuz when you
[6:50] go out in the world they say oh
[6:51] everything's fine you're okay the way
[6:53] you are and you know and that that
[6:54] doesn't prick your heart when you come
[6:56] to the word and then someone comes in
[6:57] the pulpit and says something and and
[6:59] applies to your life and even if it's
[7:01] something that you're doing wrong it's
[7:02] going to prick your heart it's going to
[7:03] it's going to stir something up that
[7:05] wasn't stirred up before but when you're
[7:07] just given you know a validation and oh
[7:11] everything's okay and and you know just
[7:12] wave everything off and the the world's
[7:15] not the problem you don't have any
[7:16] problems you're perfect the way you are
[7:18] no that that's that's that's a lie and
[7:20] and it's going to it's a lie that's
[7:21] really going to do more harm than good
[7:23] people do that in intention they kind of
[7:25] intend to you know help you out and lift
[7:28] you up but is what really is going to
[7:30] edify you and and perform excuse me
[7:35] per improve improve and perfect you is
[7:38] what's going to be the things that are
[7:40] hard to go through it's going to be the
[7:41] sorrow you know that's why sorrow is
[7:43] better than laughter because the the the
[7:45] sorrow of your countenance but your
[7:47] heart will be made better so it it won't
[7:50] always feel good but it is good for you
[7:52] kind of like medicine sometimes and as
[7:55] the scripture said it is better to hear
[7:56] the rebuke of the wise than for a man to
[7:58] hear the song of fools so I pray that
[8:01] you know when we come to um when we come
[8:02] to church we're not here to hear the
[8:04] song of fools you know even um Paul said
[8:06] you know if I come here and I try to
[8:08] please man I can no longer be a servant
[8:10] of God so when people are up here we're
[8:12] not trying to appeal to you we are
[8:15] trying to help you but we're not trying
[8:16] to appeal to you know what you want to
[8:18] feel or or the things that maybe would
[8:20] sound good to you but we're trying to
[8:21] edify you and bring you closer to what
[8:23] the scriptures say because you see
[8:25] churches where they don't really teach
[8:27] the scriptures they just say what people
[8:28] want to hear and the Prosperity Gospel
[8:30] and you know and that's why you see
[8:32] these huge crowds and it's cuz they
[8:35] don't really know what they believe in
[8:37] so they can draws many people in and
[8:38] they can kind of cater to the people and
[8:40] me but God said it's always it's going
[8:42] to be the minority it's going to be the
[8:43] smaller group that that really gets
[8:45] through because they're going to be
[8:46] preaching the truth and the truth is
[8:47] abrasive the truth can hurt sometimes
[8:49] the truth it's not always going to be a
[8:51] comfortable atmosphere in the truth but
[8:53] it's going to be what's good for you
[8:54] it's going to be it's going to be better
[8:55] for you in the long run so you must go
[8:57] through struggle to build character God
[8:59] will not spare the rod on his children
[9:02] amen let's turn to Psalms
[9:17] 141 41
[9:25] verse4 Psalms 141:4
[9:30] incline not my heart to any evil thing
[9:34] to practice Wicked works with men that
[9:36] work iniquity and let me not eat of
[9:38] their dainties so dainties is once again
[9:41] just something pleasant something that
[9:43] that is nice to hear something that is
[9:44] dainties the literal definition is
[9:46] something that is like something good to
[9:48] eat you know something that's tasty so
[9:50] it might might it's kind of like junk
[9:51] food basically where you know it tastes
[9:53] real good but it's really not good for
[9:55] you it's going to cause you a lot of
[9:56] problems especially if you eat it
[9:57] consistently you're going to start
[9:59] gaining weight you're going to start
[10:00] getting headaches many things will
[10:02] happen if you continous to eat junk food
[10:03] it's not good for you and that's that
[10:05] that's what the world is is trying to
[10:07] give you is the dainties the work those
[10:09] that men that work iniquity they're
[10:11] trying to give you these dainties and
[10:13] you know brother brandham he really
[10:14] talked about how it's really going to be
[10:17] close it's going to be very close and
[10:19] it's going to be the religious world
[10:21] that we really have to look out for you
[10:22] know everyone looks out you know uh
[10:25] outside the world and looks oh look what
[10:27] they're doing look the Muslims are doing
[10:28] look at what the government's doing but
[10:30] brother R so the Antichrist is going to
[10:32] be a religious spirit it's going to be
[10:33] so close so you really have to watch
[10:36] that spirit and it's going to be you
[10:37] know maybe someone who who comes up here
[10:39] and really tries to make an impression
[10:41] on you but they're going to slip
[10:44] something in there where it's something
[10:46] that you want to hear and something that
[10:47] that that you don't really need to hear
[10:49] so they're going to try and slip
[10:50] something in there that'll um you know
[10:53] just like when you know when these
[10:55] crimes happen when someone is you know
[10:57] date raped or someone just slips
[10:58] something in their drink you know most
[10:59] of that drink is still intact but
[11:01] there's a little something in there
[11:02] that's going to knock you out and it's
[11:03] going to be for evil so it's just going
[11:05] to be that little thing you know like
[11:07] brother Dale us say the little spes
[11:09] little foxes will spoil the vine so it's
[11:10] going to be those little things we need
[11:12] to watch out for we want to be pure and
[11:14] completely pure before God's eyes you
[11:15] know because God is not going to accept
[11:17] any any leaven in our bread amen there's
[11:20] not any leaven in the doctrine any
[11:22] little thing it's going to make the
[11:23] whole lump corrupt so we don't want any
[11:25] of that we want to be completely pure
[11:28] when we you know when we search the
[11:30] scriptures and when we live our lives in
[11:32] verse 5 says let the righteous smite me
[11:35] it shall be a kindness and let him
[11:37] reprove me it shall be an excellent oil
[11:39] which shall not break my head for yet my
[11:42] prayer shall be their shall be in their
[11:44] Calamity so it's quite literally saying
[11:47] let the righteous smite me so I I
[11:51] believe that we have you know good
[11:52] ministry here and and there's good
[11:53] ministers in this gospel and they're
[11:55] going to say things that are that might
[11:57] you feel like you're being smited you're
[11:59] going to feel like you're getting hit
[12:00] over the head but it's good it's a
[12:02] kindness it says it shall be a kindness
[12:04] because you know there's many people who
[12:07] their ministers and their their
[12:08] preachers they don't Smite them they
[12:09] don't tell them what they should be
[12:11] doing enough and it's going to lead them
[12:13] you know to the wrong place if they're
[12:14] not careful so really to for the
[12:17] righteous to Smite you it it will really
[12:19] be a kindness you know for God to show
[12:20] you where you're supposed to go it will
[12:22] actually be a kindness even though it
[12:23] might hurt in the moment it is genuinely
[12:25] a kindness so if your heart is stirred
[12:29] by what some a brother says it is a
[12:31] kindness that your heart is being
[12:33] stirred at
[12:35] all amen and let's turn to Psalm
[12:48] 17 17 verse1 hear the right oh Lord
[12:52] attend unto my cry give ear unto my
[12:55] prayer that goeth not out of feigned
[12:57] lips let my sentence come forth from thy
[12:59] presence let Thine Eyes behold the
[13:01] things that are equal thou Hast proved
[13:03] Mine Heart thou has visited me in the
[13:05] night thou has tried me and shalt find
[13:08] nothing I am purpose that my mouth shall
[13:10] not transgress now that's a wonderful
[13:12] scripture thou thou has tried me and Sh
[13:15] find nothing that's a wonderful thing if
[13:17] if God can try all our lives if God can
[13:19] really examine all of our Lives can do a
[13:21] full scale investigation on our lives
[13:23] and find nothing amen that's what we
[13:25] need to that's what we're going to need
[13:27] you know to get through through um
[13:29] to get to heaven to to be purified to be
[13:32] perfected to for all all the all the
[13:34] virtues that we need to add we're going
[13:35] to need God to look through our lives
[13:37] and find nothing and that's the mature
[13:39] bride he's looking for amen but as long
[13:41] as he's looking through the blood he'll
[13:42] find nothing so you just claim the blood
[13:44] and that's what it's for you claim the
[13:46] blood so that God will find nothing
[13:47] wrong with your life because the blood
[13:49] the red blood will make everything white
[13:51] as snow
[13:52] amen so those things he'll find nothing
[13:55] and and that should be our desire as
[13:56] Christians that he'll try our life and
[13:59] find nothing and that as the scripture
[14:00] says I am purpose that my mouth shall
[14:03] not transgress amen and uh let's go skip
[14:06] to verse
[14:09] 8 verse eight verse eight says keep me
[14:12] as the
[14:13] apple of the eye hide me under the
[14:16] shadow of thy
[14:18] Wing from the wicked that oppress me
[14:21] from my deadly enemies who Compass me
[14:23] about they are enclosed in their own fat
[14:27] with their mouth they speak proudly
[14:29] they have now compassed us in our steps
[14:33] they have set their eyes bowing down to
[14:35] the Earth like as a lion that is greedy
[14:38] of his prey and as it were a young lion
[14:41] lurking in secret places arise O Lord
[14:44] disappoint him cast him down deliver my
[14:47] soul from the wicked which is thy sword
[14:49] amen I love that scripture arise O Lord
[14:52] disappoint him amen and we know the
[14:55] devil is also compared to as a lion who
[14:58] is lurking who is seeking seeking pray
[15:00] but we want to pray arise oh Lord
[15:02] disappoint him when next time you pray
[15:04] and just pray for pray for whatever
[15:06] you're going through and say arise oh
[15:07] Lord disappoint him disappoint the devil
[15:10] you know cuz when we pray for you know
[15:12] Revelation the devil's disappointed when
[15:13] you pray for your children the devil is
[15:15] disappointed you know when when people
[15:17] you stop being a Halfway Christian and
[15:18] you want to live the full scriptures of
[15:20] God the devil is disappointed you know
[15:22] when you when you show up to Sunday
[15:23] school and you show up to church on time
[15:25] so you don't miss Sunday school and you
[15:26] show up and the in certain things you
[15:28] know
[15:29] that you know you should be doing that
[15:30] maybe you don't always do the devil is
[15:32] disappointed when you see someone really
[15:34] living the word the devil is
[15:35] disappointed I guarantee when the devil
[15:37] was trying job and he was letting the
[15:39] God was letting these things happen to
[15:40] job the devil was disappointed because
[15:42] he took his cattle away he said you
[15:43] built a hedge around him you made it
[15:44] easy for him and then he takes it all
[15:46] the way and the devil was disappointed
[15:48] and he said well actually and he kept
[15:49] moving the goalpost to keep try try job
[15:52] further he kept trying to say well
[15:54] actually you know well you know uh well
[15:56] there's more there and he kept trying to
[15:59] kept trying to argue and argue but the
[16:00] devil was disappointed because every
[16:02] time job was tried he stayed righteous
[16:04] and he kept staying righteous and he
[16:05] kept talking to the Lord he always you
[16:07] know kept praying and he he he kept in
[16:10] communion and in relationship with the
[16:11] lord the devil was disappointed so that
[16:14] is our that is our goal today is to
[16:15] disappoint the devil you know and the
[16:18] first thing that job did when he when
[16:21] when he when he first lost everything
[16:22] the first thing he did was
[16:25] worship and he said blessed is the name
[16:27] of the Lord for the lord giveth and
[16:28] taketh away way but it says job worship
[16:30] that was the very first thing he did
[16:32] amen and I guarantee the devil was
[16:34] disappointed so next time you go through
[16:36] something maybe just have a little
[16:37] praise break have a little worship sing
[16:40] a song to the Lord read a scripture the
[16:42] devil will be disappointed because he
[16:44] expects he expects when something bad
[16:45] happens to you that you'll be all down
[16:47] and your head will be down and you'll be
[16:49] you know you feel like you're you're not
[16:50] you're not there and you feel like
[16:51] you're just not living up to what you're
[16:53] supposed to but just sing sing a little
[16:55] song to the Lord sing a song you know
[16:56] that's on your heart and you know the
[16:58] scripture says he'll give you a new song
[17:00] as the scripture um I believe it was
[17:03] Ecclesiastes we read that said you know
[17:05] they want to hear the song of fools but
[17:07] God said he'll give you a new song in
[17:08] your heart you know we sing that song
[17:10] Blessed Assurance this is my story this
[17:12] is my song we don't want the song of
[17:14] fools we want the song of Blessed
[17:15] Assurance we want the song of you know
[17:17] creating me a new heart oh Lord we want
[17:19] the song of redemption that the Angels
[17:22] can't sing We want those songs we don't
[17:23] want the song of fools we want to be
[17:25] rebuked by the righteous and we want to
[17:27] you know fully receive that in the way
[17:29] that we're supposed to and in the spirit
[17:31] that we're supposed
[17:32] to and so don't be Halfway Christian you
[17:35] know come to church the devil will be
[17:37] disappointed when you come to church and
[17:39] and you hear something that will edify
[17:40] you and that'll that'll really help you
[17:42] the devil will be
[17:43] disappointed and uh verse 14 psalm
[17:51] 17:14 for men which are thy hand oh Lord
[17:54] from Men of the world which have their
[17:56] portion in this life and whose belly
[17:58] thou fillest with the head Treasures
[18:00] they are full of children and leave the
[18:03] rest of their substance to their babes
[18:05] ask the musicians to come at this
[18:07] time um so it
[18:11] says once again it says the the evil you
[18:13] know they're their um their bellies are
[18:16] full of children and we know there's
[18:17] definitely a any parent knows and most
[18:20] people know there's a spiritual battle
[18:21] with our children with with all of the
[18:22] children and that people are trying to
[18:24] attack the children and you know the the
[18:26] Bible says to raise them up in the way
[18:28] they should go but the world is trying
[18:29] to do the same thing in the way that
[18:31] they want them to go but we know that we
[18:33] have we have a a a calling you know to
[18:35] raise these children and live brother
[18:37] Dale said live before the children and
[18:39] that's what's really going to help them
[18:40] is living before them and living their
[18:41] life continuously before them so we
[18:43] don't want the once again disappoint him
[18:46] if the devil's looking to take your
[18:47] children if he's looking to to strike
[18:49] you down or trying to you know make make
[18:51] you feel down and then you have that
[18:53] that that low atmosphere around your
[18:55] kids or you have this depressed spirit
[18:56] and and and your kids your children are
[18:59] going to see that so we want to
[19:00] disappoint the devil and don't let them
[19:02] see that let them see you worship when
[19:04] when something bad happens let your
[19:06] children see you worship let your
[19:07] children see you go to prayer and get on
[19:09] your knees and guess what they'll do
[19:10] when they come across their own trials
[19:12] going they do exactly what you did the
[19:13] same way they learn to walk by looking
[19:15] at you walk they're going to learn to
[19:17] pray they're going to learn to worship
[19:18] by looking at you worship amen because
[19:20] babies don't learn to walk on their own
[19:22] if a baby didn't have you know see
[19:23] adults going around and walking on their
[19:25] two legs they would never think to do it
[19:26] but they see a model they see an example
[19:28] example and instinctively they follow
[19:30] that example so the same thing with with
[19:33] Parenthood and just even just even if
[19:36] you're not a parent even just a
[19:37] membering the church and just showing
[19:39] you know the younger people how how
[19:40] really how to live and I pray that are
[19:42] younger people would disappoint the
[19:44] devil based off your example Amen in
[19:48] verse
[19:49] 15 as for me I will Behold thy face in
[19:53] righteousness I shall be satisfied when
[19:55] I awake with thy likeness and I love
[19:58] that scripture you can it can be
[20:00] interpreted maybe in a few different
[20:02] ways as in when I awake with thy
[20:05] likeness that you know you awake close
[20:06] to the Lord and the Lord is there when
[20:08] you awake and when you rise but also I
[20:10] think it can be interpreted as you know
[20:12] if we're Christians we awake with his
[20:14] likeness as then we look like him we
[20:16] walk like him we talk like him we act
[20:17] like him and and so that you
[20:20] know we and Jesus are the same we're
[20:23] joint erors with him so when we he said
[20:26] be perfect as my Father in Heaven is
[20:28] perfect so if we walk perfect they're
[20:30] going to confuse us for Christ and I
[20:31] think that would be a great thing for
[20:32] them to confuse us with I think uh even
[20:35] our brother Daryl ward has has a
[20:36] testimony it's probably better for him
[20:37] to tell it but I think he said he was he
[20:39] was you know being kind to a woman in an
[20:42] airport or something and I guess she was
[20:44] blind and then she asked them are you
[20:46] Jesus and that's a wonderful thing that
[20:48] you know if you were to help someone and
[20:50] they would think man this person is are
[20:52] you Jesus and for you to be so full of
[20:54] that spirit and to be such a kind and
[20:57] and doing what the scriptures say to do
[20:58] do and be so just be such so in that
[21:01] atmosphere and so in that way of
[21:03] thinking and that way of doing and to be
[21:04] reading your scriptures and be praying
[21:06] like coming to church prayed up and all
[21:08] these things for someone to ask are you
[21:09] Jesus so when the scripture says you
[21:11] know when I awake with thy likeness I
[21:13] believe that's what we should be
[21:14] attaining that's what we we should be
[21:15] aiming for is to awake with his likeness
[21:17] to be in his likeness so amen God bless
[21:20] you
