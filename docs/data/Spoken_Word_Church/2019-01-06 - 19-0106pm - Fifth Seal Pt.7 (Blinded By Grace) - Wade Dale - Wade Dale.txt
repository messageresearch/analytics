see a human today hope you come to see God Almighty in human flesh a man good to be in the house of the Lord good to see each and every one of you happy new year to all of you had a we probably had the biggest group what's not group we'd ever had a lot of you weren't here so you'd all come we'd had a full house but we had pretty much full house and had a good time had a good time brother Chris did a real good job he said tell everybody hey he's he's traveling back tomorrow I think or maybe it was yesterday I can't remember but he said to tell you again god bless you love you with a lovely Lord let me read something real quick that we got on the Internet I believe it's sometimes we think we're walking through the valley of dry bones and sometimes we have a real narrow perspective of what's going on but as brother Joe told us for those of you that weren't here on walks night service brother Joe kind of gave us a overview of the views of the internet which was up into the hundreds of thousands of time and all that hours and all our thousands of hours of time and and I believe he said we reached every country now every country in the world has clicked on our internet sites so we had missed one or two the last time but now I think we've we've covered them all but listen to this it says brother Dale I just want to say that your series on the baptism with the Holy Ghost is probably the best I've ever heard I believe it behooves us as Christians to examine ourselves and our experience with the Word of God to make sure we have what we claim we have I have for some time now struggled to dovetail all the details of justification sanctification in the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the things of sensations and such I studied intently on the subject through brother Browns teachings and I knew baptism was not the shouting in the tongues but was the Word of God coming alive in you it's a revelation and mine was Romans chapter 8 concerning the love of God in Christ Jesus that revelation changed me and I was never the same again I knew that's where I met my Lord that was there was no sensation just a revelation I didn't even really understand entirely what happened that night just that I was his and he was mine but Satan Ward was on my mind on sensations and such and after seeking God for answers I can say he has used your sermons to confirm me and reveal himself in me all over again thank you brother for the wonderful teaching I've been wonderfully blessed and I praise God for the operation of the Holy Ghost through you brother blank blank revealed Word Tabernacle so we just got that today so some people don't sleep through the sermon some people will you let's turn to revelation 6 we're gonna get started today we at the end of the at the end of the service we need to number one we prayed over a few prayer cloths to send to Mary and Micah but we've got some more we want to pray over and y'all can send them to Cathy right you have their new address okay we're gonna give you the she requested us to give pray over them so they can take them to their new home over in Japan so so we're gonna pray over a few more that's probably not enough to hang over the doors and put in cars and all that so we're gonna pray over a few more into the service all of us are gonna pray and we'll send the other ones I'll give them to y'all and y'all can send them okay just pray for Mary and pray for me and Michael that's a commendable thing to do if you're going overseas to another country need all the help you can get and there's one thing about our Lord he's never out of Wi-Fi range he doesn't need a tower he doesn't need a he doesn't need a satellite or a cell phone he's ever-present and he'll be right there with him in Japan so Lord bless you reminded me though I'm gonna leave these right here so if I don't just remind me revelation 6 today we're going to still can on the fifth seal part seven and I want to title this one blinded by grace think of that blinded by grace all right because it was grace that was extended to these fifth seal Jews and grace is unmerited favor nothing they did but it was done by God himself because of an act of grace and actually grace is what blinded him your grace the grace he went and came and got a Gentile bride that grace is what blinded him the grace to you where the the headstone cross grace grace unto it that's you and I you and I the grace that God extended to us blinded his own children and therefore being a just God he gives them eternal life man so let's just bow our heads Heavenly Father thank you for this day that we have this time that we've come to reflect on the word Lord as brother Dale has been preaching that's not letters on a page because all that will pass away but Lord the word manifested in a heart as this brother just sent us the email there that's the Living Word of God made manifest in a human being Lord I pray that you'd be with each one here in the sanctuary Lord be with the ones that are sick ones that couldn't be with us Lord we pray that you would just be the active participant in the service you do the speaking you do the hearing and only you can do the revealing father just let it not be a meeting of minds Lord let the word sink deep in our heart and show us what day and time we're living in and show us our position so that we can become better Christians Lord forgive us of our sins let's brother Lewis and Emmett on the way back get him back here safe Lord with his family Lord just bless us now and be with the other missionaries on the foreign fields Lord brother Knoll Johnson comes to mind Lord he is his wife's having some trouble with her heart so he not gonna get to go to India as long as he wanted to Lord I pray that you would just give him fruit for his labor Lord he Labor's every year over there Lord and we pray that you're just touching me just bless us now in the firm of this service in Jesus name we pray amen and when he had opened the fifth seal I saw under the altar the souls of them but were slain for the word of God and for the testimony which they held and they cried with a loud voice saying how long O Lord holy and true dost thou not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth and white robes were given and every one of them and it was said unto them that they should rest yet for a little season until their fellow-servants also and their brethren that should be killed as they were should be fulfilled you may be seated the Lord that is a blessing to the reading of the word man so now we've been talking a little on the fifth seal here this is number seven and we know one thing's for sure we're not going to bring this chart out but we know that we've come to the fifth seal and this fifth seal each seal to me I was thinking the other day that each seal sure it has the the seal meaning has the seal that we were talking about had two seal on it where the first seal was the wild horse rider was the Antichrist and the things he done but then when that book opened we saw the Thunder underneath that seal that spoke of our Redemption all right so the redemption of our whole being comes under that seal we're talking about the your human body and then your human body a man is to be redeemed and potentially it's already redeemed it was redeemed at Calvary amen and you we just got to come to a realization of that because Satan has worked through that memories and conscious affection and imagination to tell us that that's not true okay well Christ is in the soul he is the soul he's trying to tell us that he's already done it so there's your war there's your you know you you brother Brian made the illustration of white dog black dog and I've heard people preaching the message that that was in your soul that's not in your soul you're either black dog or white dog in your soul but what happens is when the white dog enters the soul the black dog tries to come back in so it moves out to that next room which is the spirit realm and there's your black dog white dog fight because listen there's no if you're born again today there's no fight in your soul Jesus said come to me all that labor and heavy laden and I'll give you rest it's not the day of Sunday we come to rest no we fight and work on Sunday for Christians like we do and you know most people in the world they rest on Sunday well we don't rest on Sunday no we fight and then we fight all seven days a week but Sunday we have to fight because we come into one group and we have to fight the devil to get here we have to fight the devil while we're here we have to fight him when we leave amen so that's already that okay but our soul is at rest your soul is not in a fight it's God it's that next realm that's got to be worked on the memories and conservation imagination that's what we got to work on that room and I believe that's where the seals work on that room shows us that we're already justified as we said before seal one being justification as though you never did it seal number two the Red Horse Reds always sanctification the sanctification of your spirit realm which is the statue of a perfect man because remember think of this that's think of this last night we were talking in the Bible study can I make a point here Kenneth do you mind I'm going to anyway listen if you hold an office in this church you should be at Bible study every that's only 12 Saturdays a year if you hold an office in this church you should be a church every service because people are watching you and some of you hold offices and you don't come to Bible studying you know why you shouldn't be an officer amen she's not being officer thank you brother dating a man he's that shouldn't be an officer all right look this these characteristics emanate from your soul right because you're not looking at the knowledge of man you're looking at the knowledge of God that comes from your soul that's what we were talking about last night these emanate these are the what stature of this man right here and he is where he's in your soul if you're born again so he's he is these virtues are emanating from the soul outward to get into the spirit realm you just gotta let it out and work on this and let it out let it out let it keep working out and then it's just going to change this guy it's just going to change it I mean we've already come to a temporary change you don't do the things you used to do do you hang you don't do the things you used to do the things I used to do I'd do them no more hey man okay so if you did not go to church you're the okay I've always said hey Jim you don't need to wash this best anymore I've always said the people that come to Bible study really are the ones that don't need it the ones that don't come as one to need it one more time yeah think about it anyway well you know what Bible study always talked about God we're gonna talk about I feel left out I guess I mean you know there's sometimes you can't come I know that you know that to this but man there's 52 Sundays in a year you ought to be able to make about 50 em I mean everybody takes a two-week vacation right but some of you come twice and take a pizza 250 we play case so anyway no if you want to be spiritually fed you got to go you got to get where you the food's out right why can't okay I can't I can't I thought I can't yeah cuz you know what this bride we was thinking about this a little bit last night this bride is an overcoming bride we're not just bride then you just lay back no you'll fight your way all the way through and man this is not a picnic clear your schedule for God and I'll promise you he'll make time for you hey man all right so now we come to the black horse the black horse we see the new birth which is coming to adoption in the Statue of a perfect man we know we get the spirit of adoption when we're born again but we are come - we are coming to a place of adoption amen I'm still number 4 as all those wrapped up together which is the word made flesh are the body change cause remember on the fourth seal we took a rapture so there has to be a body change somewhere in there amen because we're leaving now that's you just got to see that that when we leave this earth where's the bride of Jesus Christ have already come to full adoption we've all come to full revelation of a body change amen not another body see that's the lazy people that don't come to church no I've got a fight to keep this thing under control you and I have got to fight to keep this thing under control and the bride's caught up on the for sale so now we've been talking about the fifth seal which is the higher form of justification that you realize that the real you never did it doesn't matter what you what your mind says and we were talking last night don't don't get this to where they so much send this perfection that we're going come to a place to where you know we don't have a bad thought please brother Brown said this thing's gonna be sticky all the way to the change so that's what I said it's a fight all the way to the change hey man so you must fight to know the real you never did it and to know the real you never did it is to see yourself in the word that that Genesis 1:26 man is that person residing in you today and that man never did it amen and you will only see it we were talking yesterday now last night in the Bible study this is full revelation folks we've got the full we we are in a buffet debt debt that Golden Corral rinds anybody hungry yet and and the Chinese buffet that you can get anything if your heart's desire this is we're past that during the ages they had certain places they could go to some got McDonald's some got a steak but you and I all we gotta do is walk in and say I want this and God will already have it there for you because you and I now have the rebel a even see Paul like catch what brother Dale was talking about when John is riding on the Isle of Patmos the second now he's in the first church age but the seconds never come the thirds never come for man he's just in the very beginning of Christianity but he's telling us what was going to happen to us 2,000 years and past another thousand for the millennium and then going into the future home he's telling us the whole thing and remember it was only compiled in a book about Luther's time to where we can say we have a Bible and we can read Genesis through revelation so a lot of it had to be that you believe what the preacher said but now you should believe what a good gospel preacher says but you still should check it out you've got plenty of resources you know I was looking about the Holocaust we're gonna talk about that because that's what comes into the fifth seal just put in Holocaust and the computer you can read for two hours about what happened to the Jews because listen that's what I was saying before John saw a fifth seal Jew you and I have that history available to us he did not he didn't I don't believe John when he wrote the fifth seal he wrote what he saw I don't believe he said now this is going to be the Holocaust Jews and there's six million I'm gonna be killed by a man named Eichmann and Hitler and but we do we have that in our disposal and for those of you to think it don't happen you're contrary to the Bible the Bible says it happened so I don't need somebody to tell me that the Holocaust didn't happen now please that's just pitiful it happened because the word said it happened a prophet of God said it happened Amen so I don't have to have anybody else's opinion that it didn't happen right so now we are now under the fifth seal we're going to see like I said before blinded by grace a group had to be blinded so that you and I could come in because if not he would have come to them they would have accepted it and we would have not been included because according to the Old Testament you and I might have a little bit of chance to get in a little piece but not the fullness that we see now amen or you can see where we talked about the the Gentiles being grafted in but now the Gentiles were grafted in the true grafting was after Jesus had died and the Jews had put him on the cross but now you got to remember I'm the one that put him on the cross but physically the Jews 2000 years ago they said let his blood be on us and our children turn rejected that Mossad that came to them he came to his own and his own received him not amen but you and I are recipients of God blind in the eyes of the of the Jews and so that you and I could be the wild olive branch could be graft and then as we said before it's not just the branch because the branch lives off the life and the life is totally that old part of the Jewish tradition the old part of the Jewish life it's what the Prophet said he killed the life he just took an olive branch off of another tree and grafted it right in lived off the life you and I live off the life of the Old Testament you know why because brother branham said Jesus's body was what formed by the Old Testament prophets if you can't see Christ in every verse read it again now that goes back to like brother Tom used to say them old war stories got a little mundane or you know this one begot this one and that one killed this one but it all is in type coming down showing Jesus Christ good prophets it if you can't see Christ in every verse then you need to read it again alright so now we're in the fifth seal everybody okay alright so now let's read the first one let's just read these quotes real quick to just catch everybody back up number one Oh Lamb of God come forward we pray we're calling you Lord the great Redeemer come forth and show us your plan of redemption now he's on the fifth seal and he's still talking about the plan of redemption because literally the fifth seal Jew is considered in the plan of redemption but you and I get the spiritual part because remember in Revelations for one we're caught up not seen until revelations 19 none of that is to us in the literal part revelations 10 brother well revelations 10 is does but it's also to Israel hey man they have to live the book amen in the days of the voice you know I like that because when brother Dale said dad I thought well I've never seen it that way it doesn't say in the days of the written word it says in the days of the boys now you know what I do I'm like on Patmos I'm standing and I'm looking and a voice says I am Alpha and Omega the beginning in the end and I hear the voice I turn to see William Branham because we know that no women I hear the voice of that seventh angel prophet but when I turn I see the Son of Man I do just like John I turn I see the bride so when I listen to a tape I don't see William Branham I've never seen him before physically some of you have but I have never seen him you know wow yeah we saw him in 1950 on the movie but that's not in person but I know his voice and like John on Patmos I turned to see the voice well when I put a tape on I don't see William Brennan I see a voice talking to me talking to a bride and I see that he has brought us a word to the bride to make a bride for this seven church aged about you know I read the other day brother Branham said the angel said what you'll be gathered with your people he said old branham's he's they said no your converse the people that are converted under your message or under your ministry that's what we're sitting under now we're sitting under where John gets the book and he eats the book in Revelations 10 8 that book has has John didn't take the book and start walking into the different countries you don't see the book no more John becomes the book or the book becomes John because when he eats the book the book disappears that's the same thing with you and I but as long as we got in sure we like to read quote but if that quote doesn't come alive I make it say a whole lot of different things like this morning you want to know it here's an example in Sunday School class this morning we were reading in Romans and Paul was talking about kind of like the nine spiritual gifts in other words he was giving us a list of things and Aaron read them off for us but you know what I've done when I read a couple of those passages of Scripture mind immediately went to robert Tatum the characteristic Robert Tatum had was in that in that sentence in that scripture and some of you agree because we know brother Tatum beautiful I can't read it it wasn't part of what I was gonna talk about but the same thing but so did that words stay on the page it became alive because Robert a double live that Tatum live that's that scripture so when I see that scripture I see a person who used to sit right here I see that person that's what you got to see you guys see yourself in the word but when you're reading the word you see others because it brings to your memory how that there's one word brother that's the brother Dale was long-suffering everybody shake your head yeah he's long-suffering he'd fight sometimes only one time a long time ago so how do you put up with these people I'll not tell you what he said but that was my question but you know what is he had patience that's why amen that's why that patience right there kind of higher up close to the statute to the top of the pyramid is to have patience brother Brown said have patience with God but he also said have patience with the people so he's long-suffering and so is God he's long-suffering we'll me and you amen so now let's read the second one so we're still talking about breaking the fifth seal shows us the plan of redemption which to me it shows us grace grace amazing grace and then now let's go to number two the fifth seal now notice and not first souls under the altar now here's one we get some agreement but just watch from it I thought that too but it didn't come that way I've always thought that these souls under the altar with the martyrs of the early church now listen hold that word martyrs cuz we got to talk about that in a little bit because remember the fifth seal Jew is not a it's not a Jew that just died a natural death I'll read you where brother Brown says it's the mark there under the martyrs altar and a martyr is someone that is killed for a purpose okay so it's not every Jew and my question is I'm gonna ask you this question there was a lot of Jews that survived the Holocaust and they died a natural death well they fit filled you because brother Bram says they got to be martyred they got to be killed for that purpose mmm maybe they weren't predestinated maybe they weren't part of God's plan because I'm gonna tell you brother Brown says only those that are predestinated Jews as the ones he's gonna save so that's my question there were something that now that was something survived that could tell us what went on right so they had to survive there was about a hundred out of that article I'm going to read you in a few minutes they were killing fourteen thousand Jews a day imagine a slaughter of fourteen thousand people a day for twenty something days straight don't tell me it's not real the martyrs he thought this was the martyrs of the other church I thought so myself but when the Holy Spirit showed division it isn't the salt so none of this fifth seal look none of this fifth seal is talking about a Christian martyr a Christian person it's not talking about anybody with the new birth the fifth seal Jew is a group of people that's given white robes after they've died a martyr's death there by okay that that's that's and that's the specific because remember now look Gentiles were saved as numbers we don't know what that number is but there's gonna be just 144,000 saved 12,000 out of each tribe and there's only gonna be a fifth seal Jew that's included in the martyr but 20 martyrdom between brother Branham I'll read it a little while to the cross and right now okay okay so there's a specific group because he deals with the Jews as a nation Jews Israel you and I are whatever doesn't matter where we're Caucasian so we're everything so these are not the souls of the broadchurch so forget about the fifth seal Jew let's make it plain if it was that it would be real simple cuz I accepted eternal life here I get my robe then I go getting another in another dimension when I pass away but what about a group of people that live their whole life not caring to hear about Jesus Christ because he wasn't them aside to them but I'm a Jew I'm God's chosen so I am going to live that life doesn't matter if Germany comes or whoever comes Poland or whoever comes and says we're going to kill you for being a Jew well I'm sorry I can't help it I'm a Jew so boom they take them and put them in a gas chamber that person is going to get eternal life for being who they are not the testimony of Jesus Christ but the testimony they held that's what the Bible says alright so there's not the souls of the bride Church to me that's the easy part you get eternal life here you go in the sixth dimension but you take the fifth seal Jew it's just a Jew that doesn't get a white robe here they don't live a Christian life here they can be smokers and drinkers and all those things but they gave their life for being a Jew and they're put in a place and they're in a holding place waiting for the something else to happen alright and then they're given white robes because of what God did blinding their eyes we'll read in just a minute brother Ram nails it of course he nails it all the time but I found a good a quote where he really really narrows it down so now look so the fifth seal I don't need to read the rest of that quote the fifth seal fifth tells you is not a Christian Jew all right so it's not somebody that give their life for the gospel or for the testimony of Jesus Christ no it says for the word of God what they were in the Word of God and the testimony that they hell all right so let's go to the seal the seal says when he had opened the fifth seal I saw under the altar the souls of them that were slain for the word of God and for the testimony can we change that please to the seal the seal revelation 6 verse 9 through 11 no the other way no the other way no there you go and we had opened the fifth seal I saw under the altar the souls of them were slain for the word of God and for the testimony which they held they held on they didn't try to hide they were Jews and they cry with the loud voice saying how long O Lord holy and true dost thou not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth now they've got enough consciousness to know that something happened to them while they were alive and they were put in this place for a purpose because they look to this side and they look to that side and it's their people that they died in the death camps with in places like that okay and they cried with a loud voice saying how long and white robes were given unto every one of them and it was said unto them that they should rest yet for a little season in other words in other words what you know what I would say is hold on a minute you know how a Jew is they're pretty high strung cuz that's what they're saying they said with a loud voice they cried with a loud voice how long the Lord so he said rest for a little season until your fellow servants and their brethren that should be killed as they were should be fulfilled so we now these were souls under now I want to add a word here because brother Branham adds the word later on these are under the martyrs altar Christians are not under martyr altar they're under the altar of God the sixth dimension they're under there in that six dimensions we're perfect love we're the new birth you have the new birth here that's what takes you when you pass the way it takes you into that sixth dimension thereby okay with that but the martyrs altar now sure there was 68 million Christians killed they were martyred but they just went in the sixth dimension okay they're in the sixth dimension with Columbus group amen with their gathered with their group and they're waiting dimension inside of a dimension and then that okay cuz brother Brown didn't see Paul he didn't see Iranian see Martin the angel said you'll gathered with your people so they're standing at dimension inside of six dimension that's probably seven dimensions you got Paul's group over here you got Arrhenius because you're gathered with your age and they're gathered what they gather for the Word of God why they're Jews the testimony they held and then judge and avenge our blood so they've got an attitude a little bit because brother Brown said a Christian wouldn't do that a Christian would say forgive them Lord but these people are not saying they're not very forgiving judge and avenge our blood right so white robes are given because of what God did he gave them white robes and they got a rest for a little season what 2,000 years during that 2,000 years they got a rest for a little while until their fellow-servants and brethren are killed which will be as brother Brennan will tell us in a minute the 144,000 that's killed when we leave we were talking about that last week on on the seventy weeks of Daniel so now let's go to the transgression just keep going up no signal all right let's read the transgression remember words in Jeremiah there we go all right the Lord said unto me in the days of Josiah of the king I stop seeing that which black back siding black backsliding Israel hath done she has gone upon every high mountain and evergreen tree and played the harlot let's just read the red part whereby backsliding Israel committed adultery I had put her away and giving her a bill of divorcement yet her treacherous sister Judah feared not but went and played the harlot also so anyway God put them away I put them give him a billing of divorcement and put him away and they are not to be his wife anymore they're to be servants because he's fixing to take a new wife a Gentile bride amen let's roll it up and read the red part down there says then save earth to go proclaim these words say go return thou backsliding Israel saith the Lord and I what God caused my anger to fall upon you for I am merciful saith the Lord graceful saith the Lord and I will not keep anger forever only acknowledged on iniquity that thou has transgressed against the LORD thy God and has scattered those to the strangers under every Green Tree and you have not obeyed my voice that the Lord turn old backsliding children stay at the Lord for I am married unto you and I will take you one of a city and two of a family and I will bring you to Zion Jeremiah 31 behold the days come saith the Lord that I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Jacob not according to the Covenant that I made with their fathers and the day that I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt which my covenant they break although I was a husband unto them saith the Lord but this shall be the Covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days saith the Lord I will put my law in their inward parts and write it in their hearts and will be their God and they shall be my people and they shall teach no more every man his neighbor and every man his brother saying know the Lord for they all all know him for they shall know me from the least of them to the greatest answer Lord for we'll forgive their iniquity and I will remember their sin no more that fifth seal Jew in God's eyes has no sin he can't give them eternal life and see their sin blinded by grace i interject myself here for a minute God is blinded by grief he don't see your sin does he he and see your sin does he what blinded him the grace that he gave to you Oh think about that that was fresh I didn't have that mono all right let's go the next one Romans 11 well now then the branch was broken off that I might be grafted in no we we talked about that last last Sunday because of unbelief they were broken off so when Christ died on the cross their unbelief broke them off from anything to go to God amen when they said let his blood be on us and our children God cut the Jews off and blinded their eyes so that the Gentiles could come in that 69 weeks of Daniel was over one week left after the rapture according to the Bible according to the Bible only three and a half years of preaching left to them you don't get three and a half years of preaching you only get three and a half years of tribulation but there's seven years left according to the Bible and then I don't care what anybody says I really don't if an angel from heaven comes and preaches any other thing let him be accursed used to who know out cause you know what he can't deny what he said in the Bible he can't deny that he shall make a covenant with many for one week who's he he's the Antichrist what's one week one week equals seven years good grief so you know what it's so simple it blinds there 99% of the people in this message it blinds their eyes amen and they also if they buy not still in unbelief shall be graffed it in for God is able to graft them in again what's he gonna do he's gonna take that he grafted us in during the 2000 years of the church ages then he's not going to forget him he's going to take and graph them right back into the 144,000 during that one year or seven years of time after the rapture of us our rapture we're gone we have nothing to do with that wait listen the best thing we can do is is do like I did a couple years ago take the Daniel 70 weeks from a total Jewish perspective because it is not to us it's not it's not for us now it shows us in it where there's a division there word where the church ages come in but that's not to us that's to them they get to 70 years of captivity they get to 70 weeks we're gone when that last week starts amen mm-hmm but now look I would not brethren that you should be ignorant of this mystery source of mystery but now remember even depaul it was a mystery because he didn't break that fifth seal I still didn't break during Paul's time he prophesied of it but he did have a revelation that blindness happened to Israel that the fullness of the Gentiles could come in he didn't know about the end grafton he could see all that grafting in and grafting out and putting in the wild olive Co that's in the Old Testament that's in the Old Testament Paul could read that it blind but see it doesn't say blindness but watch this unless you should be wise in your own conceits the blindness in part has happened to Israel until the fullness of the Gentiles be come in they you and I are right at the cusp of that the fullness of the Gentiles you and I finish up the fullness of the Gentiles everybody that's in the seven churches we are the end we're at the end of the whole Gentile dispensation the blindness in part happened to Israel until the fullness of the Gentiles be come in don't you think God he's he's just waiting he wants to go to that 144,000 listen in a type with Joseph in just a minute Joseph was so glad to see his brethren but what was one kid he was glad to see he was glad to see old Benjamin he hugged him and cried why because they had to say mama and he was born after Joseph had left and what's that a type of the 144,000 that little Benjamin group Joseph went straight to him and so all Israel shall be saved that is written there shall come out of Zion a deliverer and shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob now who's Jacob Israel Jacob is Israel for this is my covenant unto them when I shall take away their sins now his covenant is that's 6 fold purpose because that's the restoration and the saving of Israel which is what I can understand reckless reconciliation for iniquity bringing the everlasting righteousness all those things you understand then so I said the 6 fold purpose to me explains all the Daniel 70 weeks if you'll just read the 6 fold purpose amen because the first three has to happen during the time of the two prophets the other three has to happen while everybody's gone because you can't you can't bring in everlasting righteousness before the Battle of Armageddon hello you can anoint the temple before the Battle of Armageddon there is no temple so it has to be built after the two prophets are gone it has to be built going into the Millennium and then that's its full purpose a wonderful statement brother Dale maze the six fold purpose puts Israel in the Millennium the revelation of the sixth seal puts us in the Millennium hey man so it's for both of us it's it parallels just a wonderful wonderful thing that we don't have time right now to go through the Daniel 7 to which we went through it last week if you have any questions please ask a question a minute I don't mind we've been over this too much - man we order no it just it ought to be a part of us and we shouldn't like I said but here we go again we shouldn't have to go back and say brother Brown said because he said what the Bible said you say oh I got this well if you got to quote this contrary to the Bible brother Branham is not wrong the Bible's not wrong so guess who's wrong you are well how many times did we read in the Bible Jesus said baptized the name of the Father in the name of the son in the name of the whole ego we read it to people and tried to convert them to it and it's what the Bible says but that ain't what the Bible says hey man it's it to me it's just it just it gets more clear in this sixth in this fifth seal a lot of things have cleared up for me myself and I hope this helps you clear things up and it's not just when you see a Grace when you see Grace extend it to you that blindness was in part to a group of people that God loved he cherished he held them he was married to that person Israel and he had to divorce her because of what she did which was which was the judgment but then he blinded their eyes so that we could come in and then he's going to lift that off of them we're going to read it here in just a minute right here we're gonna read it right here and once ya'll say unto him what are these wounds in thine hands now listen jesus is not going to physically appear to the Jews when we leave a man but they're going to see Jesus Christ through those two prophets they're gonna preach him so real until they're gonna see they put those wounds in his hand you and I've never seen the wounds in Jesus's hands have you but I believe it I believe it it's real and once you'll say unto him what are these wounds in thine hands then he shall answer those which which I was wounded in the house of my friends in the house of my friends remember Abraham was not a son of God Abraham was a friend of God only sons and daughters of God have the new birth in their soul Abraham did not have the new birth in his soul so he was a friend of God I'm just telling you what the Bible says remember the Bible is called Abraham the friend of God right so that's what has that those which I was wounded in the house of my friends awake o sword what word against my shepherd and against the man that is my fellow saith the lord of hosts smite the Shepherd and the Sheep shall be scattered and I will turn my hand upon the little ones who was the little one we just talked about Benjamin the Benjamin group is the 144,000 listen after we leave that's the last group to receive Christ as Savior because then everybody else dies and then we go to white throne judgment and the foolish virgin they are given eternal life but they didn't accept Christ here or they had already took a rapture I'm and a cup of water in my name all the people that's going to be good that's gonna be giving eternal life they gotta wait remember the Bible says the Dead lived not for a thousand years amen Zechariah 12 said I will pour upon the house of David now what was he talking about Jews Israel David was due and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem the spirit of what Grace and of supplication and they shall look upon me whom they have pierced and they show mourn for him as one mourning for his only son brother Brown said they'll come to realize that they killed him and they missed him they missed their Messiah and actually they physically put him on a cross amen and shall be in bitterness for him as one that is in bitterness for his firstborn in that day shall there be a great mourning in Jerusalem as the mourning of how to had a remand in the Bali kind of strange them comes up in the valley of Megiddo where the Battle of Armageddon is gonna be fought amen and the land shall mourn ever family apart thereby all right with that say Amen alright let's go to number three and read this real quick now who are these souls in that's the next thing who are they then if they are not the early church this is Israel that's to be saved as a nation all of them that are predestinated that's Israel that's Israel itself oh you say wait a minute they can't oh yes they are to be saved here let's settle it just a minute I got four or five scriptures I'll take one let's take Roman just a minute find out if they are Oh No let's keep the book of Romans and go to the eleventh chapter of Romans and we'll find out just let's just read it and then we'll have it by ourselves Romans the eleventh chapter 25th 26th verse no listen it Paul Paul said if anyone else even an angel preach any other gospel what he was to be cursed watch probably would not brethren that you should be ignorant of the mystery we just read that lets you be wise in your own conceits there you are the blindness in part has happened to Israel until the full full filling fullness of the Gentiles be come in the last Gentile bride be brought in for the bride the blindness comes to Israel for that purpose all right and so all Israel shall be saved that is written there shall come out of Zion a deliverer we just read that and shall turn away ungodliness for Jacob right now they are Israel that's under this altar Israel was blinded for the very purpose of us being saved you believe that now who blinded them God God blinded his own children no wonder Jesus standing there at the cross and them Jews howling for his blood that was his own kids and he was the scripture he was his self the word in here he knowing look knowing that those people would have gladly received them they knew that Old Testament that's the reason he blinded them so that they wouldn't recognize him he came in such an humble way and blinded them to that that they wouldn't receive it see the scripture said they would do it and he blinded was blinded Jesus pitied them even so much as they father forgive them they don't know what they're doing they were blind Paul said they were blinded for a Cause for us notice now I want you to watch this real close they were given robes they didn't have them they were given robes white robes each of them now the Saints now I already have one they get it here but there they were given robes and the Saints already had theirs and gone on see they had not seen they had not a chance they had not a chance because they were blinded by God their own father so that the grace of God could be fulfilled so the bride could be taken from the Gentiles so I said blinded by grace grace is what blinded the grace to me and you is what blinded him the Jews amen so are we recipient of the fifth seal yes you say loss to the Jews yes it is but we're recipient of it and then there are hold on but there are recipient of us receiving Christ Oh hallelujah I like that amen now let's go to the next scroll it on that and talk about Joseph for a minute remember what happened in the story of Joseph Joseph would suppose the kill sold for thirty pieces of silver perfect type of Christ well when he went to Egypt what was he given he was given a Gentile bride the other of the children of Israel were cut off right just like what happened now cut off the children of Israel were cut off but what did when they come to get provisions what did Joseph remember Joseph didn't physically blind their eyes cuz he was one man during a story but they were blinded because he what he put on a different veil hello he put on a different veil and changed his voice I believe his voice was heard by the Gentile bride but not bothered because they they didn't know who he was they just they listened they assumed he was dead especially Reuben and all them that were you know they got caught up in that they're the ones that did that right Reuben and them knew what they had done to Joseph but they really didn't know what happened afterwards because they lost touch with him during 2000 years he was getting a Gentile bride and they were thinking he was dead amen but what happened when he come back and he said hey cuz remember during that story remember God crossed the arms of the two twins that came out right brother Larry one was the younger and one supposed to be the ribbon was tied on the first one to come out because I was the first born memory he pulled his arm back and the second baby was born God had crossed him he said what happened he said I didn't cross her arms he said God crossed her arms why it was the old Orthodox Jew that now had a new kid us amen perfect time then you come up with Joseph Ariens now he's standing in a court with all of his brothers standing around him his own blood brothers and they didn't know who he was but what did he do he sent the Gentile bride to the castle sent her a raptured her into the castle and then what'd he do he revealed himself to the Jews he revealed itself and yet What did he say he said this was to preserve you this was to preserve life this was so I could get a Gentile bride and that we can have two children the whole story we could we could go all over the story but let's don't go through it but it the story of Joseph as the type of cross but read it with this fifth seal in mine where he revealed itself now after the Gentile brides gone he reveals herself to his brethren and then they're saved right he gives him all that provision they're saved he brings them in right so now let's read the fifth seal now notice these souls under the altar was these the souls understanding now that now that are under the altar while they were martyred by sinful men like Eichmann see they're holding right on millions of them but they remain Jews now remember what is it they were killed for the word of God's sake not for the testimony of Christ do you understand that but remember the church come in also the martyrs of the church was for the Word of God and the testimony of Jesus Christ that makes us different right we have the testimony of Jesus Christ here how many knows that here - all right but these don't have the testimony of Jesus Christ for the word of God and for the testimony which they held as Jews and Hitler hated them so denied Minh so did Stalin all of the rest of the world but they stayed true do you know that the United States knew they were killing those Jews the United States and England knew from 1942 to 1944 what they were doing and didn't do anything about it I'm gonna read it to you in this article it kind of strange that my hometown newspaper on the day I'm gonna speak on this writes a whole full page article about the Holocaust that's not strange because it proves a lot of things were that we we didn't live through but we had we've got right we've got good pure history you know it didn't happen 5,000 years ago it happened only 100 years or 50 years 60 years ago for the Word of God and for testimony which they held as Jews and Hitler hated them so tonight my soldier Stalin all the rest of the world but they stayed true to what they believed and they killed them because they were Jews that's all I mean it was just because they were Jews now let's go to number 5 mmm now watch they had in their blindness martyred their Messiah let's go back 2,000 years all right back to the cross they had in their blindness martyred their Messiah and now they were reaping for it they realized that they recognized after it was gone on they seen then when they come before the altar of God now what's he talking about when those fifth seal Jews died and they went under that ought martyrs altar they realized they martyred Jesus cuz look it says right there and now they were reaping for it they seen then they come before the altar of God but now the grace of God is to them now watch now they could not by no means be Saints because they would already be robed but here they are now just souls under the altar for the word of God testimony they hell for being God's people the Jews but now watch the grace every time you read ever read the fifth seal circle every time brother Ram said graves it's phenomenal how many pages of grace is in this because it it's to see that's the grace seal the grace of God comes to them and Jesus gives them each one a white robe watch plumb over after the church is gone because they were loyal to their cause and they were blinded and they didn't know it they didn't know it they were playing exactly the part that God had ordained for them to play and here John looks over and sees sold under the altar now watch he sees those souls watch what he calls them they cry Lord how long just a little while longer see let's get that as we go down through the scripture they realized they had been murdered they had murdered their Messiah and they didn't know it but then they realized they got murdered back to pay for it they got murdered by to pay for it for doing the wrong now look what a thing they had to do see they was guilty of murder so they got murdered wow that's pretty strong but that's exactly what happened they cried out his blood be on us see that's right and they were blinded now if they hadn't have been blinded God said let them alone they're not worthy but being that they were blinded by I got his grace reached down to them amen talk about Amazing Grace and give every one of them a row because all Israel will be saved every one that has his name written that's right let's continue reading still in the fifth seal I do not think by the opening I do think rather by the opening of this fifth seal as I believe that it's open to us I did it with good conscience with clear revelation before God not trying to just make it think because I always was against organization never would belong to him but it opened to me now now what he's going to talk about it what he's talked about I just kind of omitted some of that you remember when he comes to the Book of Revelations 9 he talks about the the two hundred thousand thousand horsemen being released they were released on this group of people but remember the classical was released on menu the organizations that were set up that's what he's talking about ok no but I look he changes the subject here for some unknown reason he just come pops right up and says I do not think you know I do think another thing by the opening of the fifth seal on this day straightens up a doctrine right here that I might speak of of soul sleeping and I just wanted to cover this in case somebody thought just looking in you never know so mind you in the message or whatever now I realize there's people here that does believe that and that doctrine is is when you die you go to the grave and your soul stays there with your body your soul stays in that grave and in kind of a limbo state see now that's the doctrine not in the message but this fifth seal disproves that because I think that this proves that they're not sleeping they're alive their bodies are sleeping but the souls not in the grave they're in the presence of God under the altar and let's keep reading around him now our to settle it for those who soul now watch it under the altar of the breaking of this seal that have been slain in the time now here he's taught the fifth seal Jew or the Jews that's been slain from the time between the death of Christ and the going up of the church the Eichmann group and all them true Jews with their name on the book if you'll watch my brother according to the scripture they could talk cry out speak here and had all five senses not sleeping in the grave unconscious they were very much awake and could talk speak hear anything else now we're going to paragraph 459 brother Brown begins to hint he's humming only believe I think or I love him one now quietly reverently before God as we seen this seal open to us garden having to take his own beloved children and blind their eyes and send them because of his own judgment see remember he couldn't send them in the sixth dimension that's where the bride goes so he had to make a place for him a place of holding God happened to take his own we love children and blind their eyes and send them because of his own justice requires judgment of sin think of it his judgment justice and his holiness requires justice a law without a penalty is not a law and his own laws himself he cannot defy and still remain God that's the reason God had to become man he couldn't take a substitute a son that wasn't just an ordinary son to him or something God became both Jesus became both son and God the only way he could just Lee do it God had to take the penalty himself it wouldn't be just to put it on somebody else another person so the person of Jesus was God manifested in the flesh called Emmanuel now watch here's his whole point and to do that and to take a bride and to save a lost bunch of heathen Gentiles he told me and you he had to blind his own children and then punish them for it in the flesh for rejection but his grace provided rope his grace provided robes for every one of them you love the Lord hey man let's read this right here just from at the peak of the Holocaust the Nazis murdered 14 thousand Jews per day okay and the ledger of evils perpetrated by humans operation Reinhard holds a special place over the course of 21 months starting in March 1942 Nazi forces and their collaborators rounded up 1.7 million Jews from 393 Polish towns so they were only dealing with Poland which is real close to Germany and ghettos and dispatched them in tightly packed rail cars to three camps in Germany occupied Poland's so BR Treblinka and Belzec at these three killing centers members of Poland's once thriving Jewish community were murdered with such efficiency and ruthlessness that roughly 1.5 million Jews who passed through their gates a mere 100 and 2 would survive to bear witness by November of 1943 when operation Reinhard ended essentially no Polish Jews were left for the Germans to kill listen hitler's final jewish question was is get rid of not one of them or 100 of them all of them he was going to exterminate the whole kind of strange it he had a little Jewish background pitiful in it all right this guy drew upon a painstakingly account of Nazi train schedule to analyze the kill rate of Jews between February 42 and December 1944 with in operation Reinhard's 21 month campaign of extermination he discovered a 92 day period that stands out for its ferocity in August September in October of 1942 he calculated German forces and their allies in Poland killed at least 1.3 2 million Jews that averages out to fourteen thousand three hundred and forty-eight Jews per day every day 14 thousand a day basically you take 1.3 million that's probably the population of Atlanta and within three months it's empty this concentration of murder in three month period likely created substantial confusion amongst its victims and it's speed would have made them wait made it impossible to organize the resistance the Jews calculated this thing they did it so fast because you know what if they started just bringing two or three of us out of the building you know some of us would kind of catch on and we we'd probably try to you know make us some get us some guns or something but they did it so fast that the possibility of organized resistance was difficult to coordinate in that time stone used the authority of estimates of the Holocaust toll on Jews which rain ranged from five point 1 million to 6.2 million that's half of the state of Georgia I think Georgia's got 12 million people in the state half the state of Georgia was wiped out to reckon that as many as a quarter of the Nazis Jewish victims were murdered during these three months of operation reinhold although they all they were were preparing war crimes here it is my document recently unearthed from United Nations says the governments of the United States Britain and the Soviet Union were aware that at least at least two million Jews had been murdered and another five million were at risk of being killed although they were preparing war crimes against Hitler and his generals the Allied powers did little to protect or provide sanctuary for your excuse they were scared we exterminate them will exterminate you but this is where this this six million Jews we know where they're at now we know the reason that happened amen listen to this I'm gonna read this and then we'll then well I'm gonna read another statement an estimated two hundred ninety two thousand of the 1.3 million perished during a spasm of violence they were killed by bullets by special shooting squads called the ox grouping the remaining were dispatched by poison gas within hours of their arrival at the death camp brother brems tells us in the feast of the trumpets he reads revelations 9 1 woe is past and behold there come two woes more Hereafter what were the three woes three wars first world war was over here comes two more second had to come and then we're looking for a third world war alright but we're not going to be here and the sixth angel sounded I heard a voice from the four horns of the golden altar which is before God saying to the sixth angel which had the trumpet loose the four angels which are bound in the great river Euphrates and the four angels were loosed which were prepared for an hour and a day in the month in the year for to slay the third part of men and the number of the army of the horsemen were two hundred thousand thousand and I heard the number of them brother branham talks on the fifth seal and the six sorry the feast of the trumpets paragraph 173 they don't have this I'm just going to read it now he loosed under that sixth seal those two hundred thousand spiritual demons started in Rome see they were released under the sixth seal but remember they had to come under that they brought that fish sealed you inside that alright if Whitney brother Brown was wrong okay and notice over in the Bible where they were they receive power as kings but weren't crowned because remember I went in Hitler never were Kings they were dictators but they never became a king but they acted like kings he said all the Spirit of God moving through me now just saying something I don't know how to say it he says notice two hundred thousand demons turned loose upon those Jews when they burned him they crucified him they put bubbles in their veins they killed him till they had no more gas to kill him with they shot him till they had no more bullets to shoot him with and they done everything they could do they cremated their bodies and everything hung them on fences innocent people because they were Jews they were done that way but God said he gave each one of them a robe undeserving as they were but His grace to blind so that we could see notice we find out natural power under the natural to a natural nation Israel was loosed and what did it do it went and made war and how it murdered and persecuted now in the ecclesiastical realm of it and I hope that God's open God opens your eyes to this now because I realize this is just not speaking to this church here this tape goes worldwide and I don't mean to hurt anybody's feelings now the ecclesiastical realm has been open from the natural revival of the old pagan Rome went forth on those Jews which was all has always been their enemy the lion with teeth and everything stomped down and broke out the people Rome always has been God's enemy and it was turned loose in the same spirit by the dictators of the world because the religious system was still holding during that time now he said it's been loosed so those two hundred thousand thousand demons the same demons that killed all those under Eichmann and Hitler are after me and you they're after us they're after us but you know what they can only they can only try their best but we live under the promise of God that says we're gonna take a rapture we're gonna take a body change we're going to come to a state of perfection we're going to have a body change and we're gonna take a rapture and all of you remember brother Branham he makes a statement I didn't put this down but in 1960 remember they had the nürnberg which they brought all the Chiefs in and they did to them what they did to the Jews but there was one called Adolph Eichmann he was the worst of the bunch dr. death they found him in 1960 and then they tried him in 1961 and brother Branham on the fifth seal I didn't bring it but he says you see they just came through that what was that was the last one of that group that had been terminated because of the killing of the Jews he said see there he said that's ended so see that ended under when that person was killed that that spirit of that thing left and that was all under that's Adolf Eichmann in 1960 he was executed in not sixty-two but you see how rough this is but he protected a whole fifth seal Jew you know all this happened so you and me could come in them two hundred thousand thousand demons were held under the river euphrates not over there under a river good grief no they weren't under a river and all of a sudden God parted the waters and the demons came out know a man named Adolf Hitler and all these different ones they come up in power and Satan anointed them with all those demons and they decided they was going to kill but you know what poor Adolph Hitler he thought he was doing the world a service everybody down through those ages thought they was doing the world a service that getting rid of the Jews but in all actuality they working right into God's plan that I've preserved this group of people in secret and not gonna let you know about it until I come to it bring it to a prophet and let the fifth seal open showing my grace you think a dog Hitler had grace I don't feel it didn't have grace he want them all dead but in killing 6.8 million of them think about this that put them in the fifth dimension they're going to be eternal and that off Hitler is gonna go where he goes and all of his other people that thought they were doing God a service on earth by taking care of this group of people and in all actuality he was working right into the hand of God putting that same group of people he despised it's one day gonna walk the streets of gold with me and you side by side and they're gonna be giving eternal life they're gonna be giving white robes in their journey I mean and their continuous of the of the look of redemption hey man so the fifth seal nothing to me I see is but grace but that grace is extended to me in you that God saved you and you didn't want it you didn't want it but now that we do have it now that we do realize that there's a place for the fifth seal Jew there's a place for in the sixth dimension for all the the dead that's went on that's got the baptism of the Holy Ghost they're waiting but you know what they're all waiting on me and you they're waiting on menu to come to a place that we realize that not grace is coming grace is here grace is a person grace is Jesus Christ that come to you and took your sin away and he can't remember just like that fifth seal Jew he can't give him white robes if he remembers what they've done I believe he throwed at it and see if forgetfulness and said this is my group of people right here I'm gonna have this group of people they're gonna be special but I blinded their eyes so that I could take a Gentile bride and then when we move out of the way he's gonna go take 144,000 bring them out of this world and put them in the same place you in our let's stand our feet god bless you there's your fifth seal grace amazing grace it's grace my you think about a group of people now now let me make this clear like I said before I don't think this is every Jew that considered their self with you because remember God knows the heart he knows that person and if they just said well okay I'm a Jew you know I mean you understand what I'm saying program said those who are predestinated God knows their heart and when they're standing there in that gas chamber you know what they may cry out they may say jehovah oh the only norman's Jehovah Jehovah God come and help us and he did sure they had to be killed by the millions but when that flesh body went into the ground that soul went over into the dimension now which ones which ones greater cuz that soul of that person is going to come back here in a glorified body listen they're not going around justice theophanies they go get a glorified body just like you guys hey man what a wonderful wonderful God we serve sing something man singing Amazing Grace how sweet the sound [Music] you take about what God did for you when you were standing out in the world and say that you didn't care one thing about Gunn you care what about grace you didn't care what everybody going to church can't care though you're the time in the nether but God had a point not had a way to get to you that no one else in this world know how to do yeah momma can't save me and daddy can't save me your brother can't save you not all bodies the only person that can save my heart Jeffie you know I think about when John Newton was write that song he looked down at those slaves all those years he was a slave trader here they took slaves back and forth across the ocean and he would listen to them not say Amazing Grace but they would sing a song that had that same rhythm to it from their homeland a group of people they did not know where they were going did not know where they were gonna land did not know where they were gonna be they were sawn into slavery by man but all thank God then one day John never found God and that's all he could say was Amazing Grace already car oh praise praise God praise God praise God praise God praise God praise God [Applause] [Music] praise God you thank him today praise God raised of praise yah praise God praise God let's say you like this oh when we fit there 96 10,000 years [Music] ever more bright shine [Music] we will have no less days we know last days tennis a heart ring [Music] you know that there's about three more verses of that song that I'd like to find because man it talks about your flesh and about all the yeah his word has promised good to me his faith my hope and or I can't get the rest I will find it though because really that's the original verses that John Newton wrote and then he wrote these afterwards but I really like the ones that that was that was wrote first because it really has another meaning to them but it is amazing great man when you look at what happened where you came from it's as its as a miracle as that fifth sealed you but you and I are holding this whole thing up we're lining those seals up brother Dale's bringing in the church ages we've had Daniel 70 weeks we're coming to a place folks so I said this year 2019 is going to be a special year we're gonna see a lot of things but remember when you see when you say that in the Christian realm you got to remember that as some go some go brother Brown says some will be able to go all the way someone I'll be able to go all the way some will be able to take it some won't be able to take it but you know what if you live his promise live his promise do what he says he's got that's what he did with the Jews they stood there and said we are Jews we are God's people and Hitler said well you're gonna die and they said well we can't deny who we are you just got to do with us what you're gonna do with us a man same way with us I mean what are you not looking at there's nothing we can do about this flesh it's in Satan's domain it's in Satan's eat fill the soul with the Holy Ghost knowing and working on that next man a man then this will have to lean into it'll have to lean toward that we're all leaning toward death what do you believe that or not every year that gets longer I'll be 59 here in a few days getting close to 60 some of you are well past that so we need we need to move on but take one day at a time I like what brother Claude said I'm going to leave you with this Matthew 24 says those who endure to the end shall be saved you won't know it until you get to the end if you really really got the goods but you will know it when you get closer toward that end you'll know that you know that you know that God has done a work in your life that God has done not just grace but Amazing Grace but let's don't make it greasy grace let's don't just live any way you want good let's come to church and do what we're supposed to do I'll say one more time if you have an office in this church you need to be here every time that something happens like that you need to be here because you know what people are watching you and when you don't show up what are you doing if we're putting an office we're fixing to elect officers again we got to do that pretty quick [Music] either we wanted to live it or we don't we're gonna pray over these cloths I want everybody to bow their head now this is for mm-hmm brother Micah and sister Mary what's the baby's name scarlet scarlet scarlet yeah scarlet we're gonna pray for those three they're going to Japan now as working for the government he's going to Japan to do something for a couple of years whatever time doesn't matter but we're gonna send these prayer cloths with them they're gonna take them with them and that we're gonna pray that God will anoint them the whole time they're there I don't know of a messege Church in Japan they might be one but they may not be close to one but they're gonna be 18 or 20 hours away from us but you know what that - God that ain't even that's not that much but we're gonna send these prayer cloths because we believe in it we believe that these cloths will do what they said they'll do because there was a group of people in the book of Acts that believed clothes that come off of Paul demons would leave when they'd lay that cloth on the people so if there's any demons over there we're gonna talk to them today and we're gonna send these cloths over there and wear these prayer cloths go the demons will flee amen let's bow our heads let's all pray together as you keep pleading the Emilee father we know it is truly amazing grace how sweet the sound that saved a wretch like me and now that we come under this umbrella that's called the bride lord we have an intimate relationship with you the creator and you told us through the book of Acts that we could take Klaus and pray over them and anoint them and send them out and the anointing of that cloth not just the material itself but the prayers of all the bride in this building is praying that were those claws are placed be a a drawer or in the car or over the door or anywhere they travel keeping them on their self a little scarlet that the demons will have to flee because not the power of the cloth but the power of the prayer behind it Lord we pray that you would anoint them truly for their journey that they're going to take father they're one of us we love them like our own children and Lord we pray that you'd protect them and that their little light would shine wherever they go and maybe as they go over there Lord they find some believers or maybe they see a group Lord that they want a witness to father just give them the anointing to witness to that group of people because everybody can be saved whether it be whatever nationality doesn't matter and the language barrier can be broken by you Lord speak through our brother and sister Lord and let they be a lighthouse Lord as they journey over to a foreign country Lord we realize that there's things over there that's not over here sickness disease different demons but Lord we that's why we're sending these cloths to protect them to help them have faith in you Lord and Lord that we'll see them again and that they'll have some really good reports Lord we actually just bless us now in the ending of this service Lord ending of this fifth seal Lord and seeing that wow what what grace that was extended that you blinded your own children so that this group of people can receive a revelation of who you are and become intimate with you lord we're your bride father we pray now that should go with us Lord this week that you'll give us Lord a supernatural charge this year 2019 Lord may we live closer to you all these New Year's resolutions of weight loss and all this stuff I want to lose some demons I want to lose some things that's been bothering me I know that the group of here wants that's here now that they want to lose not so much weight but Lord the weight of sin that so easily besets us and let us run this race with patience Lord knowing the author and finisher of our faith Jesus Christ and that we've become more intimate with you Lord as the year goes forth Lord forgive us of our sins and bless this day take care of us Lord as we go out of the building be with the ones on the highways Lord when we come back on Wednesday just annoy brother Bob with a supernatural anointing to break the word down for us Lord be with brother Louise says he's only his way home
