[28:48] herself on the work you know and she's a

[31:27] Holy Spirit come upon us have
[31:28] preeminence and his congregation Lord

[31:34] thus we have sang the song Lord we pray
[31:36] that you open our eyes Lord open our
[31:38] spiritual understanding open our
[31:40] spiritual eyes oh God that we may see
[31:43] the path that you're leading us through
[31:45] and Lord may we glorify your name at the
[31:48] end of this service and bring back to
[31:49] you all the honor and the Praises in the
[31:51] name of our Lord Jesus Christ you pray
[31:53] amen amen
[31:56] before we sit down I'd like to invite
[31:59] you to read our opening texts for this
[32:02] afternoon
[32:03] in the book of Hebrews chapter 11
[32:06] we're reading two verses Hebrews chapter
[32:08] 11 verses 5 and 6.
[32:12] this is a common verse that uh
[32:15] we normally read when we speak about the
[32:18] rapture we know that Enoch was the type
[32:21] of the Bride
[32:22] amen and so we read in verse 5
[32:37] amen
[32:39] okay so Hebrews chapter 11 verse 5.
[32:44] by faith you know
[32:47] was translated that he should not see
[32:49] death
[32:50] and was not found
[32:52] because God translated him but before
[32:55] his translation he had this testimony
[32:57] that he pleased God but without faith it
[33:01] is impossible to please him
[33:03] for he that cometh to God but must
[33:05] believe that he is and that he is a
[33:07] rewarder of them that diligently seek
[33:10] Him may God bless his word may not be
[33:12] seated
[33:14] um
[33:16] I've been uh praying for what uh I would
[33:19] like to share this afternoon and uh
[33:23] knowing that this congregation is more
[33:26] of a family church family oriented
[33:28] church and uh I was led inspired to
[33:32] to share something about Rapture in the
[33:35] family
[33:36] I want to speak about the Rapture in the
[33:38] family and we all know where whatever
[33:40] part of the world we we come from
[33:42] there's only one goal in our service to
[33:45] Christ that is to be in the Rapture
[33:46] right if you fail to be interruptured
[33:49] then all our efforts are Vain and so uh
[33:52] there's a question one time in uh in
[33:56] brother Brandon's time and he preached
[33:58] the the message thy house which is
[34:00] sometime 1961 the question goes like
[34:03] this when the Rapture takes place will
[34:05] all the Believers families wife and
[34:08] children go
[34:09] they're in the faith and trust in Jesus
[34:12] Christ as Lord so it is say the brother
[34:14] Brandon said this that's a legitimate
[34:16] question you want to know if all your
[34:19] family will be in the rapture and if you
[34:21] love your family you want to have your
[34:22] wife there your children there but this
[34:25] is what brother random answered he said
[34:27] uh we see that and then everyone that
[34:29] was found written in the book was
[34:32] delivered in that day of that before the
[34:34] tribulation so if your children your
[34:38] mother your loved ones whoever they are
[34:40] if their name is written on the lamps
[34:43] Book of Life my precious children you
[34:45] will be right there
[34:47] so it's more of a predestination it's
[34:49] more of election if our names are
[34:52] written in the Bible in the Lamb's Book
[34:54] of Life then we don't have to worry if
[34:57] we will be in the Rapture or our family
[34:59] will be in the Rapture that's why when
[35:01] the disciples came to Jesus and said
[35:03] they were rejoicing because they were
[35:06] able to cast out Devils heal the sick
[35:08] but then the Lord said to them don't
[35:11] Rejoice because you're able to just
[35:14] Rejoice because your your names right
[35:16] are written in the last book of life and
[35:19] that is what we are rejoicing for
[35:20] because we believe by faith
[35:23] that our names are written in the Lamb's
[35:25] Book of Life otherwise we cannot we are
[35:28] not able to manifest the life that we
[35:30] are living right now and so
[35:33] going to our opening text it says there
[35:35] that the Enoch had a testimony and the
[35:37] testimony please God now what is in a
[35:40] testimony
[35:41] see it's this is the life that we live
[35:44] it is the character that we possess
[35:46] it is it is our the depth of our
[35:49] relationship to God
[35:51] amen so that's our testimony it's what
[35:53] you believe in now you know because of
[35:55] his testimony that please God he did not
[35:58] taste that but was raptured now raptures
[36:01] are going on time and I believe that
[36:03] Rapture is a victory because we are
[36:05] Overcomers so uh I I don't believe that
[36:09] uh when Rapture comes you're all you
[36:11] know tired and weary and wore out no
[36:15] it's like it's like an athlete in a race
[36:18] when you when you go to a race and you
[36:20] you can see the Finish Line you suddenly
[36:22] get this what you call the second wind
[36:24] you feel stronger you feel faster than
[36:27] when you started because you're seeing
[36:29] the end of the line and so so as we see
[36:32] this the end of the line we are our our
[36:35] spiritual strengths doubled and uh we
[36:39] are not going through the Rapture that
[36:41] that were falling or we are weak but as
[36:44] the Bibles we are Overcomers and
[36:45] Overcomers Are Victorious and if you are
[36:48] in Victory then I believe that uh we'll
[36:50] be we'll have spiritualists the
[36:52] spiritual distress that we need and the
[36:55] we see that before the Rapture the
[36:57] prophet mentioned about having a bride
[36:59] without spot or wrinkle a sin Free
[37:02] Church
[37:03] see and I believe that when that time
[37:06] comes the True Believers will not have a
[37:08] desire for sin it's not doesn't but
[37:11] people are Desiring see but I believe
[37:14] that that desire will be taken away from
[37:15] us there will be a people in this end
[37:17] times desire for sin will absolutely be
[37:20] taken away and the Bible said that we
[37:22] are in the world but we are not of this
[37:24] world
[37:25] so we are pilgrims just passing by time
[37:28] will come that sin will not have power
[37:30] on us before the Rapture takes place we
[37:32] will have a body change and the brother
[37:35] and brother Branham always calls this
[37:37] body as a past house that we live in and
[37:41] and we believe that one day this will be
[37:43] changed to a glorified form now if we
[37:45] truly understand amen the body change
[37:48] then we can present this body as a
[37:51] Living Sacrifice because we know that
[37:53] this will be change I can give I can
[37:56] give up everything you can give up a
[37:58] career you can give up you know anything
[38:01] about this world because you know that
[38:02] this will receive a body change see this
[38:05] will keep us going and we know that this
[38:07] body in this condition will not go to
[38:09] the Rapture it has to be glorified
[38:11] because flesh and flesh and blood will
[38:13] not go to heaven we have another body
[38:15] waiting for that and that's it you know
[38:18] it meets this physical body it becomes
[38:20] glorified form so in the Rapture that
[38:22] body will pick up the 16 elements if you
[38:24] are not I mean if already we have gone
[38:27] in Christ and the prophet it picks up
[38:30] the 16 elements of your Earthly body
[38:32] then it's changed into a glorified form
[38:34] so we in ourselves you know we we we
[38:37] there's there's a change to happen
[38:40] because in this body right now we say
[38:42] the the the word says and the message
[38:46] says that in this body dwell no good
[38:50] thing
[38:52] in one of his message it says this
[38:54] outside man is the flesh that's what we
[38:56] look at what we see and it has five
[38:58] inlets to that body he said that is the
[39:00] evil one on the outside
[39:02] right see and now in another message
[39:05] another message he says in the inside of
[39:07] that is the spirit see and you know
[39:10] Spirits are controlled by circumstances
[39:12] right see if if you're if you're hungry
[39:15] you know you don't feel so good
[39:18] but if you're a fool and you know you
[39:20] you're happy
[39:21] I mean your happiness is determined by
[39:23] what you feel right right so we are
[39:25] controlled by circumstances if we have
[39:27] money sometimes we're happy if you don't
[39:29] have money we're not happy
[39:31] see that that's how the official
[39:33] circumstances surrounding us affects our
[39:36] spirit
[39:37] but in the inside of the inside which
[39:39] are which is what the prophet calls the
[39:41] inside man he said uh there's only one
[39:43] since the sense that controls that and
[39:45] that is the free moral agency the free
[39:48] will to choose or to reject that is why
[39:51] whatever we do
[39:53] we cannot perfect this body
[39:55] when we come to church we do not feed
[39:57] this body but we feed the inside amen
[40:01] the inside you are the Inside Man and to
[40:04] be a believer you need to come to God
[40:05] you cannot go to heaven unless you came
[40:07] from heaven see it's it's your
[40:10] destination you are not going back to
[40:11] God unless you came from God Amen if you
[40:15] are not if we were in his mind our
[40:17] origin is not some certain place or
[40:19] certain countries amen our origin is in
[40:23] the in the mind of God
[40:24] and so we can see each other
[40:26] we don't we have cultural differences
[40:29] different backgrounds see but because of
[40:32] the message we were connected and then
[40:35] we see one another as different Brothers
[40:37] but we are in the same in the same line
[40:40] of thinking because of the message and
[40:43] this is what called us to be together
[40:45] and you know our origin is not as I said
[40:48] it's not some other places but we came
[40:50] from one place which is back in the mind
[40:53] of God Amen in that back part of God's
[40:56] mind we saw he saw us in our perfect
[40:59] condition
[41:01] amen God looks at us at the from the
[41:03] beginning until to the end he's not
[41:06] actually so much concerned in the in
[41:08] between
[41:09] he saw it from the beginning we may have
[41:12] weakness we may have shortcomings but
[41:15] you know God knows our end
[41:17] so it's like you know God took us in his
[41:20] mind put us in a book sealed it to the
[41:22] Seven Seals and at the end times he
[41:25] opened the sales and then you saw your
[41:27] name
[41:27] and that's why we are following this
[41:29] message amen then we recognize Who We
[41:32] Are
[41:33] we recognize that we are not of this
[41:35] world but we are from God's Eternal
[41:37] thoughts amen and so no matter what we
[41:40] lost we we lost on Earth maybe material
[41:43] blessings or material belongings it
[41:45] really doesn't matter at the end of the
[41:47] day what is what matters will will be
[41:49] that we are part of God's Eternal
[41:52] thoughts now this will give us the
[41:54] capacity to live a life that's worthy of
[41:56] the Gospel amen we are we are the
[41:59] revelation of the seals salvation is
[42:01] something that you choose as an
[42:03] individual amen but it because we are a
[42:06] free moral agent each individual has to
[42:08] come to that choice and we have the
[42:10] power of choice but our choice is in his
[42:13] choosing right we did not choose him
[42:16] actually it is he he was the one who
[42:18] chose us and we can read that in John
[42:20] chapter 15 he said you have not chosen
[42:22] me but I have chosen you and ordained
[42:25] you that you should go and bring forth
[42:27] fruit and that your fruit should remain
[42:29] and that whatsoever you shall ask of the
[42:32] father in my name he may give it to you
[42:34] so God gives us a choice but in one
[42:38] sense we have no choice because God
[42:40] chooses you and when he choose you he
[42:42] will never lose you no the Bible says no
[42:45] man can pluck you away from his hand
[42:48] amen
[42:48] amen see he will God will persevere
[42:51] until we are perfected and so
[42:54] as we go along in this life's journey
[42:56] sometimes we we get tired sometimes we
[43:00] stop sometimes we backslide no but but
[43:03] God will persevere to look after you to
[43:06] run after you he will never lose you
[43:08] this message will run after you right
[43:10] until until you you reach that statue of
[43:13] a perfect man and as I say uh if we
[43:17] insist to do wrong God would either take
[43:19] you home before your appointed time or
[43:22] you'll bring circumstances in your life
[43:24] to bring you back
[43:25] into the into into the right path and so
[43:29] our choice is in God's choosing
[43:32] the choice to obey or not was
[43:35] back in the beginning
[43:38] God gave man a commandment and that's
[43:41] not to partake of the tree of knowledge
[43:42] see and
[43:45] he has the choice
[43:47] now we know that the woman was deceived
[43:48] but Adam was not deceived
[43:50] his decision however was to partake of
[43:53] the three of uh the knowledge of Good
[43:56] and Evil because through this act the
[43:58] woman will not be killed by God right so
[44:00] he partook it by this decision and by
[44:03] this decision of our first parents man
[44:07] was driven out of Eden
[44:08] amen it was their choice but we suffered
[44:12] the consequence right
[44:14] the choice of the parents but the
[44:16] children us suffer the consequence see
[44:19] so it what we as parents I'm a parent uh
[44:22] I'm a father of four children and the we
[44:25] as parents I would say that we are
[44:26] responsible for every single decision
[44:29] that we will make right
[44:31] for it will affect our children
[44:33] okay a right decision will bring about a
[44:36] blessing in the family
[44:38] but a wrong decision can bring a curse
[44:40] to the family amen by your decision you
[44:43] can either build or destroy the future
[44:46] of your family and this decision
[44:48] includes you know it includes the school
[44:50] that they will go to the church that
[44:52] will they will choose to be their home
[44:54] Church the place where you will live and
[44:56] all this you know daily decision making
[44:59] it will affect our children and our
[45:02] decision will actually reveal who we are
[45:04] what is our priority and what is
[45:05] important to us
[45:07] amen you see the decision of the parents
[45:10] it always affects the children
[45:13] and I would like to read a portion here
[45:16] in Matthew chapter 27 uh before the Lord
[45:19] Jesus Christ was crucified
[45:21] in March 27 uh
[45:24] we'd like to hear
[45:26] uh we'd like to read here in verse 21
[45:28] where where Jesus Christ was
[45:30] interrogated by Pontius Pilate
[45:34] you know there were two they have the
[45:36] choice during the feast day they have a
[45:37] choice to release one of the prisoners
[45:40] and they they presented Jesus Christ and
[45:43] Barabas
[45:45] and Barabas was as we know he's a
[45:48] murderer and it's a notable prisoner he
[45:51] was called Barabas see and uh in verse
[45:54] 17 he says there therefore when they
[45:56] were gathered together pilate said unto
[45:58] them who believe that I listen to you or
[46:02] Jesus Christ is which is called Christ
[46:04] for he knew that for Envy they had
[46:07] delivered him
[46:09] when he was set down on the Judgment
[46:10] seat his wife sent unto him saying have
[46:13] thou nothing have doubt nothing to do
[46:15] with the just that just man so they know
[46:18] that Jesus Christ was a just man amen
[46:21] for I have suffered many things this day
[46:23] in a dream because of him but the chief
[46:26] priests and Elders persuaded the
[46:29] multitude that they should ask Barabas
[46:31] and Destroy Jesus and so the governor
[46:34] answered and said unto them where of the
[46:36] twain will you that I release unto you
[46:39] they said Barabas pilot said unto them
[46:42] what shall I do then with Jesus which is
[46:45] called the Christ right and they all say
[46:47] unto him let him be crucified this was
[46:50] the decision of the people
[46:53] right it was not pilate who decided to
[46:54] lose the people who decided this and
[46:57] when pilate so that he could Prevail
[46:59] nothing but that rather a tumult was
[47:02] made he took water and washed his hands
[47:04] before the multitude is saying I am
[47:07] innocent of the blood of this just
[47:09] person see to it then answered all the
[47:12] people and said his blood be on Beyond
[47:15] us and
[47:17] right on our children
[47:18] I mean so maybe some of the children
[47:21] were not yet born during that time but
[47:23] they were deciding for their children
[47:26] see and their decision
[47:28] to pick Barabbas instead of Jesus Christ
[47:31] to be to be let free it affected you
[47:35] know generations of generation of Jews
[47:37] see we we see what happened to them in
[47:40] 70 A.D and we see what we saw what
[47:42] happened to them uh during the the
[47:45] Holocaust and it was because of the
[47:48] decision of this parents amen and and
[47:51] maybe these parents are long gone but
[47:53] because of their decision they said be
[47:56] it on us and be it on our children right
[47:59] right so what goes out of our mouth
[48:01] as parents it's very much important
[48:04] because it will affect the future of our
[48:06] children if the Lord that is whatever we
[48:09] say
[48:10] a profound effect on our children right
[48:14] amen see so your decision will uh reveal
[48:18] the audition reveals what is in our mind
[48:20] and you know the minds actually the
[48:23] processing unit of what is in our heart
[48:25] amen
[48:27] the the pro the the the the the the word
[48:30] says that we're thinking out from our
[48:32] hearts
[48:33] and the the thoughts are processing our
[48:35] mind and it comes out from our mouth
[48:37] amen so what comes out of our mouth is
[48:40] the one that defiles us but where did it
[48:42] come from from our hearts
[48:44] we were thinking in our hearts we are
[48:46] pondering on this thing so if you are
[48:48] pondering the negative things all the
[48:50] negative things will come out of your
[48:51] mouth
[48:52] you can sit in a prayer with a negative
[48:54] person talk to him for 30 minutes if
[48:57] he's a negative person he always talks
[48:59] about negative things 30 minutes later
[49:01] you're a negative person because the
[49:04] spirit that is in that person transfers
[49:06] to you because Spirit transfers through
[49:09] words can you transfer towards you catch
[49:11] the spirit
[49:12] amen and so we should be very careful uh
[49:15] listening to you know to to the words
[49:18] that we hear so
[49:20] moving further uh when it uh we want to
[49:24] look at Isaac and Rebecca this is the
[49:26] type of Jesus Christ in the bride and
[49:27] Elisa as we know is the messenger now
[49:30] when we when Elisa was sent to look for
[49:32] a bride he was told to go and get a
[49:35] woman from the family of Abraham right
[49:37] not from the Canaanites but from his
[49:40] family that was the instruction that uh
[49:42] uh Elisa got from his master Abraham but
[49:45] there were no other specification
[49:48] but because he was the messenger he has
[49:50] the mind of his master
[49:52] he has the mind of his master so he was
[49:54] he was he was thinking and he was
[49:56] praying about uh he was looking for a
[49:59] character of a bride
[50:01] see and when he when he went there he
[50:03] was he was just talking to himself he
[50:05] was talking to God if if this damself
[50:07] will come out go here and you know ask
[50:10] me for a drink of water she will also
[50:12] give water to the camels and that is
[50:14] what exactly Rebecca did right he he
[50:17] didn't hear anything from Elisa but
[50:21] Rebecca being the predestinated bride
[50:23] for Isaac he was able to capture the
[50:26] mind of the messenger right and he was
[50:28] manifesting it because it was already in
[50:30] his in her character to be a servant so
[50:34] you see in our times the message had the
[50:37] messenger brother Branham had the mind
[50:39] of God on what he wants for a bride
[50:42] okay so we have the Siegen of God in our
[50:45] heart and we will be able to pick up his
[50:47] mind amen as well as as well as
[50:51] Rebecca was able to pick up what was in
[50:54] the mind of Elisa and if you don't have
[50:56] the decision of God we can hear you know
[50:59] we can we can listen to the message of
[51:02] the Prophet over and over again it will
[51:04] make no difference in your life see but
[51:07] if you have a sitting of God something
[51:08] some something inside will Quicken
[51:11] amen and you know our work is an
[51:14] individual walk
[51:16] father we can I cannot say to my
[51:18] children because I am a believer you
[51:20] will be a believer they have to have
[51:22] their own experience they have to grow
[51:24] up in in maturity they have to serve the
[51:26] Lord day of day of to to have a deeper
[51:29] relationship I mean all my children are
[51:31] baptized but as I told I tell them as
[51:33] you grow up you have to have your own
[51:35] experiences with the Lord right I tell
[51:38] my wife you have to have your own
[51:39] experiences with the Lord and even me as
[51:41] a minister I have to have my own
[51:42] experience to the Lord I cannot just
[51:45] preach out of knowledge I have to preach
[51:47] out out of my relationship from with the
[51:49] Lord see so the Holy Spirit uh is that
[51:53] is there watching the family amen and if
[51:56] there's one is between the husband and
[51:58] the wife amen uh we can see that there's
[52:02] complete submission I mean if the
[52:04] husband will submit to the to God the
[52:08] wife will submit to the husband and the
[52:10] children will submit to the parents
[52:12] there will be Oneness at home and the
[52:15] Holy Spirit is pleased to dwell in a
[52:18] home that is filled with with unity and
[52:21] love and respect with each other so the
[52:23] holy spirit is pleased to dwell in that
[52:26] kind of atmosphere you know Adam and Eve
[52:28] they had a son
[52:29] his name is Abel and uh and how did he
[52:33] know that the the blood caused the fall
[52:35] no I I would I would imagine that every
[52:38] time Adam walk around
[52:40] Abel can see Adam wearing this lamp skin
[52:43] and he might be wondering it's your mind
[52:45] where did this came from maybe he can
[52:48] even see that the blood dripping and the
[52:50] and by the example amen that is so in
[52:54] his parents
[52:55] he was able to make the right sacrifice
[52:57] now Cain on the other hand was also
[53:00] seeing this kind of thing but he didn't
[53:02] have the revelation
[53:04] exactly see there was nothing in him to
[53:06] understand what he's seeing so these are
[53:08] two individuals seeing the same example
[53:11] amen but Kane never saw the Revelation
[53:14] so he never did the right uh
[53:17] the right thing so Abel made the
[53:20] sacrifice that was pleasing to God
[53:22] Kane made a sacrifice he also made the
[53:26] sacrifice but it was not pleasing to God
[53:28] right okay I mean going to the Rapture
[53:31] is about pleasing God it's not pleasing
[53:34] our parents pleasing our children or
[53:36] even pleasing somebody else it's about
[53:38] pleasing God walking in a way that is
[53:41] pleasing to God Amen so God revealed it
[53:45] through a way that the parents are
[53:46] living their life and this Revelation
[53:49] humbled Abel and it is a sacrifice that
[53:51] was pleasing to God Amen now Cain
[53:54] because lack of lack of Revelation he he
[53:58] made the sacrifice but it was not
[53:59] pleasing to God you see every time we we
[54:02] when we receive when we receive a
[54:04] revelation amen and we and because of
[54:07] that revelation we do a thing that is
[54:09] pleasing to God then that is what counts
[54:12] amen in in the Book of Luke I would like
[54:15] to to read another scripture in the Book
[54:18] of Luke chapter
[54:22] in chapter 23.
[54:26] in verse 32 it says here and there were
[54:29] also two other male factors male factors
[54:32] means the evil doers yeah criminals
[54:35] with him to be put to death and when
[54:38] they were come to the place which is
[54:40] called Calvary
[54:42] There They Crucified him and the male
[54:44] factors one on the right hand and the
[54:46] other on the left they said Jesus father
[54:49] forgive them for they know not what they
[54:51] do and they parted this treatment and
[54:53] cast lots
[54:54] and the people stood beholding and the
[54:58] rulers also with them the right of him
[55:01] saying he saved others
[55:04] let him save himself if we be Christ The
[55:06] Chosen of God and the soldiers also
[55:09] mocked him coming to him and offering
[55:11] him vinegar and saying if thou be the
[55:14] king of the Jews save thyself
[55:16] and the superscription was also written
[55:19] over him in letters of Greek and Latin
[55:22] and Hebrew this is the king of Jews now
[55:25] watch this closely now in verse 39 it
[55:28] says one of the male factors which were
[55:31] hanged railed on him right right in
[55:33] other words he was also mocking Christ
[55:35] he said if thou be Christ save thyself
[55:39] and us
[55:40] but the other on the right hand he said
[55:42] answering rebuking him saying does now
[55:45] that fear God seeing Thou Art in the
[55:47] same condemnation if we indeed justly
[55:51] for we receive the Jew reward of our
[55:53] Deeds but this man not done nothing
[55:55] amiss
[55:57] and he said unto the Jesus Lord remember
[56:00] me when thou cometh into thy kingdom you
[56:03] know that statement of one of this
[56:05] criminal discriminate these male factors
[56:08] has pleased God
[56:10] right amen he pleased God that in verse
[56:13] 42 he said verily I say unto you today
[56:15] Thou shalt be with me in paradise and
[56:19] now if you try to analyze this situation
[56:22] this male Factor on the right hand I
[56:25] mean
[56:26] all through his life he was a thief he
[56:28] never attended any Bible study he never
[56:31] attended any church
[56:33] he he never had any Revelation but I I
[56:36] could imagine that was when he was hung
[56:38] there they were seeing Jesus Christ you
[56:41] know being being nailed to the cross and
[56:43] putting this sign this is the king of
[56:46] the Jews
[56:47] this is the king of the Jews and maybe
[56:49] he had the Revelation if this is the
[56:51] king then he might have a kingdom right
[56:54] and if he has a kingdom amen his request
[56:58] was remember me when thou comments into
[57:01] thy kingdom
[57:02] and so that piece of Revelation giving
[57:06] an access to Paradise he spoke the words
[57:10] that pleased God right while on the
[57:13] other hand that male Factor saw it also
[57:15] never saw the revelation
[57:18] and what he said is instead of asking
[57:20] mercy and Grace from the Lord he start
[57:23] mocking
[57:24] amen see so this there's a big
[57:27] difference in in our perception
[57:29] amen I I was talking uh I was speaking
[57:33] one time uh in uh
[57:35] in the Philippines there's there was a a
[57:38] shoe salesman
[57:40] yeah just just to emphasize the the
[57:42] difference of perception there was a
[57:44] Salesman that was sent you know to the
[57:47] to the to the islands and the uh they're
[57:50] wanting to expand their business of you
[57:52] know selling shoes and when they when
[57:54] when that first salesman went to the
[57:56] island they said uh
[57:58] there were we we don't have any Market
[58:01] in this island
[58:03] because people were not wearing shoes
[58:07] they're barefooted
[58:08] so if you put a store here nobody will
[58:10] buy shoes that was his perception and so
[58:14] he went back to the company and told
[58:15] their boss we don't have any Market that
[58:17] forget it
[58:19] but they sent another uh salesman who
[58:22] went there the same island and so these
[58:25] people with the barefooted no shoes and
[58:27] he said he went back to the company I
[58:29] reported we have a lot of Market there
[58:31] because all people there are not wearing
[58:33] any shoes
[58:35] see the same island the same people but
[58:38] two different perceptions
[58:40] and so the and they so they started
[58:42] building this this this store and now I
[58:44] mean they got richer because all the
[58:47] people want to have their own shoes
[58:49] but it started with difference of
[58:52] perception right right we can look at
[58:54] the same thing with the different you
[58:55] know interpretation and meaning to it
[58:57] but we we realize amen like these two
[59:00] male factors here they both were seeing
[59:03] but only one got the Revelation and what
[59:05] came out of his mouth please God
[59:08] that he granted this request and he was
[59:11] able to have access to Paradise amen so
[59:14] the Rapture will come and God will look
[59:16] for things that comes out of our mouth
[59:18] if it will be pleasing amen if if we
[59:22] speak of things that are not pleasing to
[59:23] the Lord then
[59:25] we cannot say that we're living a life
[59:27] that is pleasing to God
[59:29] amen now
[59:32] we are we we every one of us here know
[59:35] the the story of how to write
[59:38] how how uh
[59:41] two sons were receive salvation and uh I
[59:46] just like to give uh to give some
[59:48] emphasis on this uh part of the the
[59:50] message where it says in question and
[59:52] answer how to write the other day she
[59:55] did this didn't ask for nothing she was
[59:58] just sitting there but she said the
[1:00:01] right thing which please
[1:00:03] right the holy spirit amen and what was
[1:00:06] the thing he said
[1:00:07] uh in another message says I know more
[1:00:10] than said that until sister Hattie
[1:00:12] sitting there crying right now hadn't
[1:00:15] said the word and she said
[1:00:16] that's nothing but the truth
[1:00:19] this simple phrase
[1:00:21] see he said the right thing said at
[1:00:24] which pleased the Holy Spirit and when
[1:00:27] the Holy Spirit was pleased by the words
[1:00:30] that came out of her mouth amen
[1:00:33] he had access to the third pool
[1:00:35] the Holy Spirit
[1:00:37] tell her you know that he could she
[1:00:40] could ask anything that her heart
[1:00:42] desires and it shall be produced right
[1:00:44] there
[1:00:45] that you know that the Lord of God the
[1:00:47] son said his prayers and of course we
[1:00:48] know the rest of the story instead of
[1:00:50] asking for the healing of her sister of
[1:00:52] asking for uh thousands of dollars he
[1:00:55] asked in this word said my greatest
[1:00:58] desires for the Salvation of my two boys
[1:01:00] amen the right desire the right words
[1:01:03] coming out of her mouth gave her access
[1:01:06] to the third pool
[1:01:07] so in brother Banner spoke it he said
[1:01:09] ask and then it happened so that is how
[1:01:13] uh
[1:01:14] when we say that we live a life that's
[1:01:16] pleasing to God amen it manifests in the
[1:01:19] words that we say
[1:01:21] it manifests when manifest interaction
[1:01:23] because we can we can always say that we
[1:01:25] are we have a life that's pleasing to
[1:01:26] God but as long as we say the right
[1:01:28] thing as long as we we do not we do the
[1:01:31] right thing then
[1:01:32] everything is just you know like a
[1:01:34] mental exercise
[1:01:35] so
[1:01:36] we we realize my brothers and sisters
[1:01:39] that uh
[1:01:40] as we go along in this life's journey
[1:01:43] there are so many things that we can do
[1:01:45] that we we might offend the Lord right
[1:01:48] right and there are so many things that
[1:01:49] we can do that we may please the Lord
[1:01:52] and most of the time it it is those
[1:01:54] words that come out of our mouth that
[1:01:56] pleases God
[1:01:57] like for example the woman whose child
[1:01:59] was vexed as we may read in Matthew 15
[1:02:01] he says then came she and worship him
[1:02:04] saying Lord help me but he answered and
[1:02:06] said it's not meat to take the
[1:02:09] children's bread and to cause it to dogs
[1:02:10] and she said truth Lord
[1:02:13] yet the dogs eat the crumbs which fall
[1:02:16] from their master's table then Jesus
[1:02:18] answered the senator oh woman great is
[1:02:20] thy faith because of what she said amen
[1:02:24] three
[1:02:25] the Lord said woman great is thy faith
[1:02:28] be it unto thee even as thou Wilt and
[1:02:31] her daughter was made old from that very
[1:02:33] hour
[1:02:34] how did this come about because of the
[1:02:36] words that came out
[1:02:38] the words that came out of of this woman
[1:02:40] amen and we can also talk about the
[1:02:42] Centurion that uh we read in Macho in
[1:02:45] the book of March also verse where it
[1:02:47] says the Centurion yeah uh there came a
[1:02:51] centurion beseeching him and said you
[1:02:52] know he has a servant that is sick of
[1:02:54] policy grievously tormented and Jesus
[1:02:57] said unto him I will come
[1:02:59] and heal him see but this is the
[1:03:02] Centurion answered now watch what he
[1:03:03] says I'm not worthy that thou should
[1:03:06] come under my roof but speak the word
[1:03:08] only in my servant shall build for I am
[1:03:11] a man under Authority having soldiers
[1:03:13] under me you know in other words you
[1:03:15] know what he's doing he knows the the
[1:03:18] the level of authority and he said uh I
[1:03:22] say to this man go and go away to
[1:03:23] another come and he comment and to my
[1:03:25] servant do this and do with it when
[1:03:27] Jesus heard it in Marvel they said unto
[1:03:29] him to them that what verily I say to
[1:03:31] you I have not found so great of Faith
[1:03:33] No not in Israel and you know Center is
[1:03:36] a gentile and so again the words that
[1:03:39] came out of the mouth of this Centurion
[1:03:41] it pleased God
[1:03:43] right in fact the Lord describes himself
[1:03:46] was he marveled and he saw uh what what
[1:03:48] what he was asking for came to pass at
[1:03:51] that very hour
[1:03:52] and every time we we speak of positive
[1:03:55] things we please the Lord
[1:03:57] amen even brother random in his life uh
[1:04:00] in his lifetime
[1:04:02] we realize how how saying the right
[1:04:05] things amen we're talking about Rapture
[1:04:07] in the family see and then one there was
[1:04:10] a story you know we know that uh uh Meda
[1:04:14] had this two more size of a lemon
[1:04:17] I decide and whether banana was supposed
[1:04:20] to go to a meeting
[1:04:22] but you know Med already wanted to go to
[1:04:24] the doctor to to have it removed and so
[1:04:27] uh he met them because maybe he was she
[1:04:30] was irritated because of what he's
[1:04:32] feeling had said something that might
[1:04:35] have offended the Holy Spirit and uh you
[1:04:37] know brother brother Brandon he could he
[1:04:40] could have he could have stood there and
[1:04:41] said that
[1:04:42] he's a prophet and he said he said he
[1:04:45] could say that uh
[1:04:47] I should I should do first my Ministry
[1:04:50] before my wife or my family or anything
[1:04:52] I mean I mean the the the the the
[1:04:54] priorities and so but brother Branham
[1:04:58] had the right mind he had the right
[1:04:59] saying he said
[1:05:01] I said Lord she didn't mean what she
[1:05:03] said that morning
[1:05:05] she didn't mean that I said Lord not one
[1:05:09] time has she ever said one word about me
[1:05:11] going in the meetings
[1:05:13] staying months or whatever it was not
[1:05:16] one time has she ever opened her mouth
[1:05:18] about it she has always sent my clothes
[1:05:21] to the cleaners amen
[1:05:23] wash my shirts and had everything ready
[1:05:25] to go in the meeting then she wonders
[1:05:27] how she can serve God
[1:05:30] see I mean when he was she when he was
[1:05:33] trying to intercede for her wife he was
[1:05:35] not saying you know
[1:05:37] have mercy on my wife
[1:05:39] he knows the Seven Seals he knows the
[1:05:42] church ages he knows the doctrines of
[1:05:45] the message no he said
[1:05:47] he always send my clothes to the
[1:05:49] cleaners
[1:05:50] see he washed my shirts and have
[1:05:53] everything ready to go in a meeting you
[1:05:55] see and he said you women as you serve
[1:05:57] your husband you serve God
[1:06:00] right see you know then when I came in
[1:06:02] all Titan world she said people coming
[1:06:04] from everywhere and I have to go
[1:06:05] somewhere on a fishing trip or a hunting
[1:06:07] trip many women would have blow up at
[1:06:10] that but what would she do she would get
[1:06:12] my hunting clothes ready for me to go
[1:06:14] let me go Lord she didn't mean that what
[1:06:18] she have said see she had to be cut open
[1:06:21] three times in account of she was
[1:06:22] cesarean and I hate to see her have it
[1:06:24] do it again and just then I heard
[1:06:27] something in the room I look up in the
[1:06:28] voice said stand up now whatever you say
[1:06:32] that's the way it will be amen I waited
[1:06:36] for just a minute just before before the
[1:06:37] doctor said
[1:06:39] the hand of God shall take the tumor
[1:06:42] away and it wouldn't be found and no we
[1:06:45] we know the rest of the story there was
[1:06:47] no operation that was done for sister
[1:06:50] Meda because when brother Brown said
[1:06:52] that right words for his wife
[1:06:55] amen
[1:06:57] God the Holy Spirit spoke to him that
[1:06:59] whatever he will say it will come to
[1:07:01] pass right and so even in our families
[1:07:03] we are all believers waiting for the
[1:07:06] Rapture it is very important what I'm
[1:07:09] trying to stress it is very important
[1:07:10] that we say the right words to our
[1:07:13] husband to our wife to our children
[1:07:15] because by the words that will come out
[1:07:18] of our mouths amen it could it could
[1:07:21] determine their future
[1:07:23] it could affect their health it could
[1:07:25] affect their spiritual life
[1:07:27] amen and so I I was I was talking to
[1:07:32] some of the ministers in the Philippines
[1:07:33] and I said what's important it's a group
[1:07:36] of ministers not a formal Minister's
[1:07:38] meeting but we were discussing about
[1:07:40] Ministry
[1:07:41] and you know when it comes to Ministry
[1:07:43] many will stand up and they say they
[1:07:45] have done this they have done this and
[1:07:46] they've done that and I don't know here
[1:07:48] in the U.S but in the Philippines maybe
[1:07:51] it's also through here in the
[1:07:52] Philippines that there are people that
[1:07:54] are
[1:07:55] or many brothers are trying to be
[1:07:57] ministers when they are not called to be
[1:07:59] ministers
[1:08:00] amen they're not called to be ministers
[1:08:03] and uh you know the prophet has said
[1:08:05] that you know that uh uh the ministry of
[1:08:07] Demand versus his family
[1:08:10] okay right
[1:08:11] if you keep on you know going around
[1:08:14] preaching away evangelizing the whole
[1:08:16] world
[1:08:17] and you leave your family with nothing
[1:08:19] to eat
[1:08:20] that's not right
[1:08:22] see everybody's blessed except your wife
[1:08:25] everybody's blessed except your children
[1:08:27] and so you can you can say that you have
[1:08:29] baptized many souls and everything and
[1:08:31] so forth and so on and you can make you
[1:08:33] know uh reports and everything
[1:08:36] but when I speak to a brother a minister
[1:08:38] I I always look at the wife
[1:08:40] I look at the children
[1:08:42] if they are spiritual then I know this
[1:08:44] brother is spiritual
[1:08:45] but if they can say that they so they
[1:08:47] have so many accomplishments and you see
[1:08:49] the wife because the wife is the
[1:08:51] reflection of the husband amen the
[1:08:53] children are the reflection of the
[1:08:54] parents if they if if they are not
[1:08:57] blessed then what you're doing as a
[1:09:01] brother as a minister is not does not
[1:09:03] count
[1:09:04] in God's scoreboard it's zero right
[1:09:07] right see so uh as I was telling them
[1:09:10] then
[1:09:11] we should put our priorities in the
[1:09:13] right place
[1:09:14] amen we should put first in the food on
[1:09:17] the table
[1:09:18] then we can be a blessing to others amen
[1:09:22] I have talked to some young people and
[1:09:23] they said I was talking to a son of a
[1:09:26] minister in the Philippines and I said
[1:09:28] when you grow up they want to be a
[1:09:29] minister said no I don't want to be a
[1:09:31] minister
[1:09:32] because when he was growing up
[1:09:35] their life was affected because his his
[1:09:38] father went on full-time Ministry
[1:09:41] and they the often they will leave the
[1:09:43] family without nothing to eat
[1:09:45] right you know go back after many weeks
[1:09:48] and you know they need something I mean
[1:09:50] these children will not understand
[1:09:52] anything about right missionary works of
[1:09:54] every or everything unless they see that
[1:09:56] in the parents
[1:09:58] so it is very important that we see that
[1:10:00] we see how we look you know how brother
[1:10:02] Branham said about they're not juvenile
[1:10:04] delinquents it's about juvenile
[1:10:06] parenting
[1:10:07] see
[1:10:08] and you can you can have a covering of
[1:10:10] doing so many things for the world
[1:10:13] but unless it is seen in the family amen
[1:10:17] that's that will have an impact I mean
[1:10:19] in in the in the children and so
[1:10:23] when we see all these things that are
[1:10:24] happening see everything that is
[1:10:27] happening around we look at the the
[1:10:28] science in the sky the everything the
[1:10:31] political scenario we look at Israel
[1:10:33] then we have to look at ourselves
[1:10:35] you may look up for your Redemption draw
[1:10:38] it now you will look you may look around
[1:10:39] and see the modern events uh made clear
[1:10:43] by prophecy but if we fail to look
[1:10:46] inside
[1:10:47] I mean it's not the things that we uh we
[1:10:51] are doing but it's the small things that
[1:10:52] we fail to do
[1:10:54] see so we have to go back to the basic
[1:10:57] and you know the basic unit of a society
[1:10:59] is the family
[1:11:01] to have a strong Church you have to have
[1:11:02] strong families
[1:11:04] amen and the strong family would consist
[1:11:07] of father mother and children of course
[1:11:08] but the spirituality of the family will
[1:11:10] determine the spirituality of the church
[1:11:13] and so we I we want to give emphasis
[1:11:17] also not not to neglect of course if our
[1:11:19] children are grown up they have their
[1:11:20] own families then they're responsible
[1:11:22] for their own families amen but uh as
[1:11:25] long as we are we are they are still in
[1:11:28] our in our uh care then I believe that
[1:11:31] we are responsible for them and
[1:11:33] everything that they will hear from us
[1:11:34] everything that we that they will see in
[1:11:37] us doing it will affect their decision
[1:11:40] making in the future it will defeat it
[1:11:43] will affect their life in the future and
[1:11:45] you see no matter how long you are you
[1:11:47] may be you know you may be in the
[1:11:49] message uh
[1:11:52] if your mind is not guarded I mean our
[1:11:55] soul maybe we may be born again we will
[1:11:57] be serving the lord but our mind is
[1:11:59] still vulnerable to the works of the
[1:12:01] devil that's why the prophet said this
[1:12:03] is the greatest battle ever fought is
[1:12:04] done in the mind not in the heart not in
[1:12:07] the flesh but in the mind and you see I
[1:12:10] would like to to to just to share this
[1:12:13] uh little story that uh the prophet
[1:12:16] mentioned in uh his message way back in
[1:12:18] 1957 the title of the message is life
[1:12:22] just to
[1:12:23] emphasize this uh the point that I'm
[1:12:26] trying to raise he said uh there was one
[1:12:29] day he saw yeah this uh there was a
[1:12:31] young lady who went to a psychiatrist
[1:12:35] she's 35 years old never smoked never
[1:12:39] drunk in his life
[1:12:40] she was a very fine girl a Christian
[1:12:42] girl
[1:12:43] see her people are Christians you see so
[1:12:47] he said her father's a doctor she gave
[1:12:49] her life to Christ at an early stage so
[1:12:51] there's no question about his spiritual
[1:12:53] life I mean for 35 years been said she
[1:12:56] has been serving the lord and the uh his
[1:12:59] family serving her family serving the
[1:13:00] lord but one day she goes out and she
[1:13:04] finally gets to a place to a college
[1:13:05] where she was teaching
[1:13:07] and the psychiatrist was there
[1:13:10] amen he sat down to talk to her and said
[1:13:12] you mean that you have never been kissed
[1:13:14] by a boy just one question
[1:13:17] you mean to say at 35 years old Never
[1:13:19] Been Kissed by a boy
[1:13:21] you mean he said he said never and he
[1:13:23] said girl you don't know what you're
[1:13:25] missing
[1:13:27] he said him being a psychiatrist he
[1:13:30] swung the girl's mind until now she's
[1:13:33] become so evil
[1:13:36] 35 years being a Christian
[1:13:38] and now because of this demonic
[1:13:40] psychiatrist
[1:13:42] swinging is my her mind he said now
[1:13:46] she's become so evil and so bad till she
[1:13:49] don't even want to hear the name of
[1:13:51] Jesus the name of Jesus spoke to her in
[1:13:54] her presence
[1:13:55] and even her father and mother can even
[1:13:57] see her no more she lost her mind and
[1:14:00] this next week will go to the
[1:14:01] institution for shock treatment
[1:14:04] now he further analyzes the situation he
[1:14:07] said it's because that she turned her
[1:14:09] thoughts
[1:14:10] from Christ and to what thy psychiatrist
[1:14:14] was moving her mind to amen just a
[1:14:18] simple turn
[1:14:19] amen and that's what we hear Jesus
[1:14:22] said that is what what we're here for
[1:14:25] this morning is to move your mind and
[1:14:28] your thinking from the things of the
[1:14:30] world unto the things of God which is
[1:14:33] eternal and that's what preaching is for
[1:14:36] is to pervert the thinking to a higher
[1:14:38] and to a better place where Christ is
[1:14:41] until you become converted then your
[1:14:43] mind reaches for those those things that
[1:14:46] which are above
[1:14:47] now the Bible says in Colossians set
[1:14:50] your affection
[1:14:51] on things that are above
[1:14:54] when I was talking to the brothers and
[1:14:56] sisters that were affected by the
[1:14:57] typhoon
[1:14:58] I mean as I was telling this morning
[1:15:01] money money is no value in that time
[1:15:05] everything that they have
[1:15:07] when we speak of the the promise not
[1:15:10] only the Believers there was I know of
[1:15:13] of
[1:15:15] a couple they were not Believers but
[1:15:17] they they were working all through their
[1:15:19] life saving money they they put up a
[1:15:23] business in those Pro in one of those
[1:15:24] provinces and when they put up this
[1:15:26] business they said oh no no they can
[1:15:28] retire
[1:15:29] and have better pay but just one storm
[1:15:31] one super typhoon
[1:15:34] it took everything that they have saved
[1:15:37] throughout the lifetime throughout their
[1:15:39] lifetime
[1:15:40] and see if you're if if their affection
[1:15:43] if their Treasures are in those uh
[1:15:46] buildings business or whatever now
[1:15:48] they're totally depressed yeah that's
[1:15:51] why the Bible says set your affection
[1:15:52] and things that are above no amount of
[1:15:54] super typhoon or earthquake or volcanic
[1:15:57] eruption our affection is on above we
[1:16:00] may we we we we may lost everything that
[1:16:03] we have here in this earth amen but
[1:16:05] that's a good thing because you are not
[1:16:08] anchored
[1:16:09] to these things
[1:16:12] not the Believers in in those provinces
[1:16:14] they were telling now we're ready for
[1:16:16] the rapture
[1:16:17] because we have no homes to go to
[1:16:20] we are not anchored in any material
[1:16:22] thing anymore see so sometimes disaster
[1:16:25] is good right
[1:16:27] right you know miss you know what
[1:16:29] happened to the wife of Lord they were
[1:16:32] right on their way out of Saddam but she
[1:16:34] has so many properties that she can
[1:16:36] stand the last look
[1:16:38] but I mean our brothers and sisters in
[1:16:40] the Philippines that were affected even
[1:16:42] though they look several times they will
[1:16:44] see nothing
[1:16:46] right they have nothing they're not
[1:16:47] anchored in any material things anymore
[1:16:49] and now they have houses they're
[1:16:51] thankful but they they believe that God
[1:16:53] can take that away again easily
[1:16:56] see so it teaches us
[1:16:59] I mean we who have not experienced that
[1:17:02] it it teaches us that we should anchor
[1:17:05] ourselves not on the material world not
[1:17:07] not on The Treasure of this world
[1:17:09] because it can easily be gone away
[1:17:11] I mean you have your own disasters here
[1:17:13] you have your 9-1-1 here you have their
[1:17:15] Katrina here and I mean many people lost
[1:17:18] their lives many people lost their
[1:17:20] properties but you know
[1:17:23] it is it should be a wake-up call to
[1:17:25] everybody but sometimes it doesn't work
[1:17:28] that way and so we see now that we
[1:17:30] should set our affection on things that
[1:17:32] are above after all the prophet said
[1:17:34] happiness does not consist on the
[1:17:36] material things that we have but but on
[1:17:39] how contented that we can be in the
[1:17:41] allotted portion for us
[1:17:43] see if you are contented in the allotted
[1:17:45] portion that God has given us you may
[1:17:48] have a bigger allotted portion than I am
[1:17:50] but if I am contented you're contented
[1:17:52] then we're equal right amen that would
[1:17:55] be no problem I don't care if you you
[1:17:57] earn one thousand dollars I earn one
[1:17:59] thousand pesos that's a big difference
[1:18:02] but but if I'm contented with this 1000
[1:18:05] Pesos you're contented to your one
[1:18:07] thousand dollars then you're equal
[1:18:10] I'm as Rich As You Are
[1:18:12] amen hallelujah hallelujah there's no
[1:18:15] problem see but the problem is in the
[1:18:17] contentment
[1:18:18] see so if if we are all contented in
[1:18:21] what we have then I can look to other
[1:18:23] people and I can look to other people
[1:18:25] like I will not compare myself
[1:18:28] there's a point that goes I don't know
[1:18:31] if you read it do not compare yourself
[1:18:33] to others because for always there will
[1:18:35] be lesser and greater person than
[1:18:37] yourself
[1:18:38] if you compare yourself to others you
[1:18:41] may become vain if you're greater than
[1:18:43] them or you may become bitter if you're
[1:18:46] lower than them
[1:18:47] and so we we I don't want to compare
[1:18:50] myself to others I want to compare
[1:18:52] myself to the word
[1:18:54] if I'm lining up with the word then
[1:18:55] that's that's fine right
[1:18:57] right I may not have everything you may
[1:18:59] not have everything but as long as we
[1:19:01] are aligned with the word then it's all
[1:19:02] right we can walk a walk that's pleasing
[1:19:05] to God
[1:19:06] see and pleasing to God means uh our
[1:19:09] affection are not in this earth I
[1:19:11] believe that Eno when he was walking the
[1:19:13] first 65 years of his life you see if we
[1:19:17] go back to Genesis 5 he said here it
[1:19:19] says here Genesis 5 21 and Enoch live 65
[1:19:23] 60 and five years and we got Methuselah
[1:19:28] see
[1:19:29] and Enoch work with God after
[1:19:32] not before but after he begot methusilla
[1:19:35] and he lived another 300 years
[1:19:38] now if I if my mathematics is right the
[1:19:41] first 65 years he was not walking
[1:19:43] perfectly with God because he said he
[1:19:45] walked with God after he begot
[1:19:47] Methuselah and he he lived 365 years
[1:19:52] okay so 300 minus 65 300 minus Q is 300.
[1:19:56] so
[1:19:57] in all the days of Enoch were 300 years
[1:19:59] and Enoch walked with God and he was not
[1:20:01] for God took him so I would say that
[1:20:04] when he started this walk with God maybe
[1:20:06] when he started walking with God he
[1:20:09] never the prophet said he never missed
[1:20:11] any word of God right right he did not
[1:20:13] misbehave everything God told him to do
[1:20:16] he done it no argument no murmuring and
[1:20:19] no matter what the people thought he
[1:20:20] went and done it just the same
[1:20:24] we see a lesson here we may not be able
[1:20:27] to start right
[1:20:28] in our walk with God
[1:20:31] and you became you became born again but
[1:20:33] but you know you just come and go and
[1:20:35] come and go so we may not be able to
[1:20:37] start that in our spiritual life but
[1:20:39] there is an appointed time in our life
[1:20:42] that we will start to walk closely with
[1:20:44] God until uh he will be so pleased and I
[1:20:48] don't know I I believe that will be
[1:20:49] global
[1:20:51] amen if you walk a place and walk with
[1:20:53] God we woke up listening walk with God
[1:20:55] one day God will come to take us away
[1:20:57] amen and you will not leave
[1:21:00] you know her family behind we don't want
[1:21:03] them to to leave them back you know the
[1:21:06] uh
[1:21:07] I I don't know if we have some military
[1:21:09] men here but uh
[1:21:12] when I was in the military in the
[1:21:13] Philippines we we have a one of the
[1:21:15] rules that we have when we engage in the
[1:21:18] communist rebels or the Muslim Rebels if
[1:21:21] if I'm like for example I'm a platoon
[1:21:23] leader and I'm Leading the People the
[1:21:25] the one of the orders do not leave any
[1:21:28] man behind
[1:21:30] you don't leave them whether they're
[1:21:32] wounded they're killed in action as if
[1:21:34] we went there as a platoon we'll go out
[1:21:36] there as a platoon see we don't want to
[1:21:39] leave any man behind amen and that's
[1:21:41] just a simple you know simple War simple
[1:21:44] battle but when you leave this earth we
[1:21:46] don't want to leave any of our children
[1:21:48] behind we don't want to leave any
[1:21:50] brother behind we don't want to leave
[1:21:51] any sister behind and so we have to
[1:21:53] encourage each one of us
[1:21:55] we have to strengthen one another pray
[1:21:57] for one another because we are here
[1:21:59] serving the lord and it will be better
[1:22:01] if we will see each other on the other
[1:22:03] side amen and so we believe that the
[1:22:06] Lord is doing everything for us
[1:22:10] showing us the things that we have never
[1:22:12] seen before I mean is slowly unveiling
[1:22:15] himself to us and you know when when God
[1:22:18] unveiled this AC cell to us see there we
[1:22:22] we know that we are in an invisible
[1:22:23] Union the bridegroom and the bride and
[1:22:26] you know there are no two persons no two
[1:22:29] persons male and female can can address
[1:22:32] before each other outside of the
[1:22:35] marriage covenant if they do that that
[1:22:37] is immoral right see of course people
[1:22:40] are doing that but that's immoral that's
[1:22:41] not accepted right right yeah but if you
[1:22:44] if you're under a marriage covenant then
[1:22:47] you can be undressed before your wife
[1:22:50] and the wife before the husband and
[1:22:52] there's no malice
[1:22:54] because they under the marriage Union
[1:22:55] and now we are in the marriage Union the
[1:22:58] invisible Union of the the bridegroom in
[1:23:01] the bride right right and so now God is
[1:23:03] not ashamed to unveil himself before us
[1:23:05] right
[1:23:09] and we are not ashamed of Christ amen we
[1:23:13] are the bride he's the bridegroom see
[1:23:15] and when when for example if I if I can
[1:23:18] read what's in the mind of brother
[1:23:20] Samuel he can be unveiled before me
[1:23:22] right
[1:23:23] see before he moves I know what he'll be
[1:23:26] doing because I can read his mind
[1:23:28] but God in this last days has poured
[1:23:30] everything he has unveiled his mind
[1:23:33] he says send it to us and if we capture
[1:23:36] it then he's unveiled before us then we
[1:23:38] can do what he what what what what he
[1:23:41] wants us to do for him and we can live a
[1:23:44] life that will be pleasing to God but
[1:23:47] again we need to be very diligent right
[1:23:49] amen we have to to to have a singleness
[1:23:52] of Mind singleness of focus as as Elijah
[1:23:56] was going up and Elijah was there and he
[1:23:59] said he wanted to have the double
[1:24:01] portion and Elijah said that's too much
[1:24:04] but if he can see me
[1:24:06] go up
[1:24:07] you will have the prophet said
[1:24:09] singleness of Mind singleness of focus
[1:24:12] then you will have what you want
[1:24:15] and so that's what he did Elijah had the
[1:24:18] singleness of mine had the singleness of
[1:24:20] focus he saw Elijah being being touched
[1:24:23] away and then and and what happened then
[1:24:26] the second hundred Rome just fell on him
[1:24:29] and he smoked the river he was not no
[1:24:32] longer looking for Elijah
[1:24:33] he was not looking for Elijah
[1:24:36] we are not looking for another Elijah
[1:24:38] he said where is the god of Elijah
[1:24:41] where is the god of Elijah and now
[1:24:43] Elijah has come in our days Elijah's
[1:24:46] left the sin but he left a message
[1:24:48] and that message if we will have
[1:24:50] singleness of focus singleness of Mind
[1:24:53] in the message that he left us then we
[1:24:56] can we can receive the anointing and we
[1:24:59] can say where is the god of Elijah
[1:25:02] where is the god of Elijah then he can
[1:25:04] work through us and we can work he can
[1:25:06] work through everybody and of course
[1:25:09] brother Brandon will always be the
[1:25:11] prophet messenger of the age there's
[1:25:13] nothing nobody coming after him there's
[1:25:15] no eighth messenger whatsoever but we
[1:25:18] believe that he has given to us what we
[1:25:20] will be needing
[1:25:22] to prepare us for the Rapture right
[1:25:24] right and so with this statements I I I
[1:25:27] pray
[1:25:29] that as we await in this glorious coming
[1:25:31] we will have to look after ourselves our
[1:25:34] family
[1:25:35] see because Rapture is in the family
[1:25:37] right right yeah we don't you don't want
[1:25:40] to be raptured by yourself we want our
[1:25:41] wives to be there the husbands to be
[1:25:43] there the children to be there the
[1:25:45] grandchildren to be there of course we
[1:25:47] cannot make the choice but by faith yes
[1:25:50] I would I I believe that I my whole
[1:25:53] family would be with me in the Rapture I
[1:25:55] believe that your family will be in the
[1:25:57] Rapture and as long as we we
[1:25:59] continuously serve the Lord and we
[1:26:01] continuously walk uh perfectly in the
[1:26:03] sight of God that will be pleasing to
[1:26:05] him then we know
[1:26:07] that when Rapture takes place we'll all
[1:26:09] be there right we'll all be there so God
[1:26:11] bless you all and I would like to invite
[1:26:14] you again to powerheads
[1:26:16] and just to say a word of Prayer
[1:26:21] our gracious Heavenly Father
[1:26:25] yes Lord we
[1:26:27] thank you Lord that you've given us a
[1:26:29] message

[1:26:34] we have lost many things in along the
[1:26:36] way
[1:26:38] we have experienced so many things Lord
[1:26:41] that sometimes we feel like not moving
[1:26:44] forward anymore
[1:26:46] but Lord you have given us the strength
[1:26:47] you've given us the courage to continue
[1:26:50] and sometimes maybe we may be wary in
[1:26:54] this life's journey but you continuously
[1:26:56] encourage us and give us strength Lord
[1:26:59] I pray Lord that when the time comes
[1:27:02] that you'll be with us it will be
