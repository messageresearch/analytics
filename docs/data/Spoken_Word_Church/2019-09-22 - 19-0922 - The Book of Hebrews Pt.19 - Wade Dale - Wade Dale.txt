========================================

eleven wherefore seeing we also are compassed because I think we stopped right down there where I got a little marker wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses left side every weight and the sin which does so easy to the seventh let us run with patience the race that is set before us and remember this race is not a this race is not a microwave race not an int no it's it's kind of like a crock pot you turn it on low and you wait two three days or a day for your food ready that's the same way because as we were talking even last Sunday you see these people falling away and and and all that is just as the Bible says those who endure to the end shall be saved so and then you look at their Bible know in the book of Matthew and you see that the the seed that Jesus planted the children of the kingdom did we forget about that the children of the kingdom his her lies and then you throw the seeds out and then it went by the wayside and it grew up and got so high and then one didn't get in the water didn't get the ribs what is good Ruth the teaching good good I was thinking the other day you know we were talking about and I was talking about it about the town's about do's and don'ts and we all have do we all have to go through the do's and don'ts so then it becomes a love affair with God to where you want to go to church you want to fellowship with brothers you want to read your Bible I mean if somebody has to tell you to press play if somebody's got to tell you to read your Bible somebody's got to tell you to study then you know III doubt your experience because that's what we're built on right now to do it all the time listen we all gotta live our lives but we can take that little bit of time too let us last out every weight and the sin which doth so easily beset us so we still have to as babies and Christ we still have to do things but I like what somebody said one time you know God doesn't need our money but the Bible is full of copy that's not for God he can make all the gold he can make this whole place one big ball of gold so he doesn't need your money said well I got a time because no you tithe because it makes it cheerful giver that's what the Bible did and you learn to give because that's what a Christian experience is it's giving it's giving it well and the money that we give and the time that we give it goes toward the kingdom of God but it's not that the kingdom of God is going to collapse if you quit paying your time no no he doesn't need your money but he needs you to be a cheerful Giver he needs you to be able to learn how to give the same way about church it's not so much the building but you need to learn to come together into into you know bind yourself together with the children of God have some fellowship where the children died it's like dad and brother Dean in the amount of Colorado couldn't find the church that Sunday to go to there was Colorado in that part there wasn't a message church to go do so they just went to a cafe and sat down had their own little Bible study right there again we'll see that's fellowshipping together that's bringing in fellowship you wanting to do the things you've done you wanting to come to church wanting to do these things I make this a treasure e to you then you don't have the new birth you just do not have the new birth the business directory to come and visit your your family members but you got revel patients you just got to keep coming so why is this going so long you know why it's going so long because of me and you need to say the same thing because it mean say me well then you're not talking about me come with you so every one of us have that we have to deal with things but like I was thinking the other day we were what we were preaching on us there but the you come to the baby form we were talking my faith you come before brother they'll come with that faith in the bottom of the pyramid when you come to that justification because I'm going to get to this insane when you start on your journey my brother tells them faith that's not an ad right no thanks not a mad it says they had to your faith your faith when you and God come together as one at the new birth it becomes your faith programs that this is mind I gave it to me so it becomes your faith add to your faith then you got seven that's right but now you can stop anywhere you want to you have that still godlike quality or that ability to stop anywhere you want to but the Bible says those who he's justified these already glorified so appearance if you're justified today that's what we were talking about Tim's going through the three stages we've just we can't even thank kids that didn't know them and you'll hear it if you get them if you get the tape but baby form justification you're not thinking about glorification when you come to the altar the first time you got saved not born again state when you come to the altar confess your sin and God is just to forgive you right you're not thinking about the headstone you're not thinking about seals and you're not thinking you're just glad that God has took them past sins away from your crown right and that's not happiness you're not you don't say oh now though I'm justified I've already glorified I'm gonna do anything no you can't think that way you're a human being you gotta thank God you just forgive me of my sins and now I'm I'm working toward getting morning in that's the problem with people that's why I stand here looking to Jesus the author and finisher of our faith if he starts it he's gonna finish it but a lot of times we give my brother man 7 to even a good work of sanctification man we think we religious or we start doing the things of God and go to church yes just think - you have to be really really careful that when you come to the baptism of the Holy Ghost and God starts teaching new things that's what we were talking about it brother Tim though I did it all through the Bible I read but about three quotes in Brooklyn but all through the Bible you look you'd say yeah those who they justify these very glorified ins the the key I want you to see is is you got to run this race with patience now when you get justified brother Tim made oh good come in afterwards because you know you can say that so much - you can just go into greasy grace well I'm justified I don't matter if I'm like I was a child molester I can still go back to doing what I was doing I'm okay I'm gonna make it real I have because that's what he knew a guy in the message that was a song leader that used that in court he went to natural court and told the judge he said God has watched me from that vile thing I did and I'm not guilty because whether I'm says the real you didn't do it well now that guy needed a berth because he didn't run with patience he what he done was is Satan entered in and told him everything was fine now I know listen you tell you go you got to believe one thing for sure you got to be that's a real fine line because remember there's a there's a brother that brother branham was associated with Pat caller that Tyler was a gunslinger he was the killer he killed people before he came to them to the message before he Kevin got born again well you know what he's not a killer anymore but you know what he didn't do he didn't use it as a crutch he didn't go to natural court and saying I didn't do that the real me didn't do it well you know what if you talk like that the other real you did do it but you do have to come to a place to where you say that if you have things in your life because once the difference in a child molester and somebody to smoke and drink what's the difference since then Rahab the harlot she was a harlot until their accusers got done away live but you got to remember one thing's for sure you gotta make sure you keep that in your mind that yeah that oh you didn't do that you're truly born again and God will never hold that against you but you better be careful because what you did you did in the body and there's still that middle memory reason constant specks of imagination that still motivates you to the green so what I'm saying is to be careful that's just not walk around and say well the real me didn't do it anyway I'm you know I didn't you know I did this you be careful until the blood of Jesus Christ will cleanse everything butBut blaspheming the Holy Ghost okay so we got to look at that if that man would have approached it right the child molester would approached it right he'd be okay because you can't hold that it gun truly justified it then he'll never have to give an account for that but you can't bring it in and justify the whole thing's what I was trying to get the people to see was is the Bible says to just and the justifier is the same now if God justifies you you're justified but the problem is we put some me in there I try to justify the things that I did or do or whatever right if you'll just leave it on Christ because looking to Jesus the author and finisher of our faith in other words he started then you give that paid to us with our faith and then he guides us up this pyramid to this capstone which is divine love or excuse me the love of God now really you get the love of God down here if you're born again you have a love of God yourself right you're just as borning in and you'll never be born again your Bride of Christ you're going into rapture if you pass away you're going to be in the resurrection you're going to take a body chain because those who is justified he's already won all right but let's not use that as a crutch to say well you know I don't have to worry about my past me you don't have to worry about your past but quit bringing it up but using that as a crutch right be careful with that we still have a spirit realm that is in this world motivated by this world memory reason conscious effect if those five things right alone your refrigerator they don't bother you pray for Miko they bother me my memory of the things I'm done I can't erase that my reasoning against the Word of God my imagination good grief think imagination and God whatever we think Salinger write whatever he thinks is still happening all right but not with us and our our affection is not it's not that affection right it's billy-oh love all right and then with memory and reason conscious man you conscious is what killed me being conscious of things you'd be conscious of what's going on being conscious so those five things but you don't have to look God's already cleaned the inside got up if you're born again he's trying to work his way out this way say he's trying to get back into his house cuz we read the book of read there and Luke where it says the unclean spirit goes out of a man walking driving places c4s pilots none comes back in here says my house same said I'll come back to my house you have to be careful you let him back in then the state at 7:00 time work that's what those who endure everything yes no it's not gate well no no party time but looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith and do your faith your faith who for the joy that was set before him endured there's the word endured the cross despising the shame and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God for consider him that endured such contradiction of sinners against himself lest you be wearing and pain in your mind let me tell you a little something had a brother we were talking about something the other day and he was at a certain church and I hate it when I just can't I can't see the wisdom and people that somebody it's like we were talking about a while ago about you know the woman comes into church there was Cindy I mind if I use you several years ago she any come walking in short hair and pants on okay did we say anything about that no I'm sure dining them did but we didn't I you could you let that you don't just set there and blast the person we've seen that happen I don't think that's God right I don't think that's God did this you know in the preacher told me one time he said I had to he said I had to hit that the woman said right in front of joy her first service you come in from penticoff first service came in sat down front and that preacher pretty everybody could have left he was preaching on her and you know what that probably bruised her in in afterwards that's what he told me he said though I had to hit that you know she walked in the door with that and I just looked and shook my head let go let me but so this brother who lived to the southern brother's church and he preached know we've had enough teaching now we need a demonstration I just don't know where these people get this that the problem is he had enough teaching to say what he did yeah and the person who came from he needed some teaching but what he was doing was he was telling this brother that reason you're not preaching today is because we don't need any of that anymore now buddy that's kind of narrow-minded right there we don't need any of that we need a demonstration I don't know what they think about demonstration there look at the healings and the power of God there's one on in this church they want it to happen every day well you know what they're wanting their long brother Browns I know I need to come back before they have a prayer line ever service and everybody's healed and everybody that's gone folks that's gone it's gone that was a one man message as far as that was concerned hey man you're already making a mess yes we're trying to get in my works you're right I told y'all I told y'all 20 years ago Satan's gonna put a man in this message with signs and wonders and they ain't gonna care what he preaches they're going to go in that's what everything's turning to now signs and wonders and all this person you ought to go through their prayer line and that's okay if you need it but man I'm gonna stand on two feet you know my brother Claude said this is really good I think brother Claude Sidney you receive your healing setting in the seat God gets all the glory if you walk up to the front of the church and brother Dale I don't care me or Donny regular whoever lays hands on you what you're gonna say is I got healed because do you know what you're doing you give him 50% of the glory to that man and 50% to God and that don't work right see that's why God said when he was here on earth he said I found no greater faith when that all the Gentiles said hey you just speak to her right before don't touch me you don't have to touch me you don't have to go in my house but then you got Jarius and all them oh come to my house a little put your hands you know and I told him many times before Jesus never screamed at her Damon and brother Graham never screams and Haman there's no way to scream at her name and now you might get him to leave for a little while he's just gonna come right back you know why because brother Brown said even that maniac that he fell at his feet somebody asked him said did he was he deliver that brother I said no it just came right back off the guy let on that demon okay so but I just don't know I want to understand that that power without character of satanic everybody's want the power power power power power God's not going to give us the power to the label manhandling right because look at Peter and Paul man I mean they just looked it I mean they call just Paul and Peter said look on us no hands lay down only for the holy up and Paul rebuked type of girl and rebuked the demon in the girl you know every time I see a demon in the Bible they're screaming in Jesus so they're screaming that the person there the person is not screaming the damn yeah brother branham during the prayer line commas of cucumber never scream didn't have to because you know what that's supreme power in control that's correct he never screamed I don't know why these people happen I'm sorry you know why because it's this you're stoking this right here and it's only temporary and yes I guess they haven't paid for a coupon it's only temporarily but we got Endor to the end for consider him who Jesus Christ my whole point was when Jesus was healing the people he was very popular but when he that's what I've told this brother I said look to me that's a compliment I hate it for the brothers that said it behind the pulpit but the brother step now I said look they hated Jesus when he started preaching doctrine when he started teaching they hated him and they cut him off who did their religious people of the day well who's the religious people today not bad this methods been ago right they say that but it is and so you're going to be hated because you're trying to teach the people the message instead of some emotion looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross despising the shame and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God for consider him that endured such contradiction of sinners against him lest you be wearing and fainting your mind so what you're saying is you're going to have there's going to be contradiction in your life but remember you must endure you have not yet resisted unto blood striving against sin so what's he saying you had been hung lacrosse you haven't been you know nobody has went through what Jesus went through nobody I mean even Peter they hung him upside down but they didn't stick a spear in his side and beat him with a can of nine-tailed pull his beard Outland with their hands all right so Jesus endured all that for us so we don't have to do that we don't have to get on the cross we bear our cross different you don't want you to get a boat across he will shoot a bear that cross all right but consider him that endured this contradiction of sinners against himself lest ye be wearied and faint in your minds you have not yet resisted unto blood striving against sin and you have forgotten the exhortation which speaketh unto you having two children my son despise not thou the chastening chastening of the Lord nor faint when thou art rebuked of him in other words Paul what he's saying we're gonna go through chastisement we're gonna go do a little rebuke from the Lord loveth he chasing it and scourges every son whom he receiveth I was thinking the other day we've had two deaths that were a one with great tragic brother Joel Reynolds daughter was killed in a car wreck 16 years old you know I was thinking I said Lord we do question but we don't as Christians you cannot question what God has done you can you cannot and then brother 10:1 hours talking then it's true see God knows what would have happened to that poor that girl if if her life would have continued on who knows only he knows and then brad johnson 62 years old brother Davey Johnson's oldest brother died of a heart attack you know it some of the things you know but as Christians we must not cannot question God we can't he knows best he's got it all under control he knows what's gonna happen tomorrow right all right sure in our humanity we do we always do I'm sure brother Joel Reynolds we do was just devastated but being a Christian that's where your anchor he's got to hold in and say hey God you know what's best for the whole plan right and and I believe she they said she was a believer if you know that she was living good Christian life so he'll see you don't worry you'll see your loved ones don't worry about them it's the separation of one hurts us it's the separation of family and and seeing them alive memory raising conscious affection imagination that what killed us right you have not resisted on blood you have forgotten the exhortation which speaketh unto you have two children my son despise not thou the chastening of the Lord nor faint when thou art rebuked of him for them the Lord loveth he chasing it and scourges every son whom he receiveth if you endure then they were again endure chastening God dealeth with you as with sons for what son is he whom the father chasing the not but if ye be without chastisement work for all our protector of all our protectors then your masters and not sons boy you don't want to be called that furthermore we have had fathers of our flesh was corrected us and given we give them rivers weed with let's get him down to here follow peace with all men and holiness without which no man shall see the Lord you see that follow a peace with all men and holiness without which no man shall see the Lord looking diligently the lest any man fail of the grace of the kind lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble you and therefore many be defiled lest there be any fornicator or profane person as Esau who for one morsel of meat sold his birthright pray do you know how that afterwards when he heaven went he would have inherited the blessing remember he was the firstborn he would have inherited the blessing he was rejected for he found no place of repentance though he sought it carefully with tears well ye are not coming to the mount that might be touched and that burned with fire nor into blackness and darkness and Tempest me he goes over back to the children of Israel in the wilderness journey and the sound of a trumpet and the voice of the words which voice they that heard entreated that the words should not be spoken to them anymore when to say this because in Moses we don't want God to speak to us any more you go let him talk to you you come down here and the Bible says they said we'll do whatever you say they like they did not do whatever they said right here he's interpolating you duck you print the signal okay he never played for they could not endure that which was commanded and if so much as the beast touch the mountain it shall be stoned or thrust through with the dark and so terrible was the sight that Moses said I exceedingly fear and quake but ye are coming to Mount Zion brother Brown said there'd be a mountains on now Carmel Mount Transfiguration all those show them but you have coming to Mount Zion and to the city of the Living God the heavenly not one owner and to an innumerable company of angels I mean something oh I guess Mia Bella close were talking the other day about if you could just look another dimension that what's going on all the things that's going on with that man this is that which is our little son of the universe there's nothing else going on no there's millions and billions of angels renting this place for God keeping you you got it every person gonna die ever believers got an angel a personal angel right right children have a you got angels that deliver this and deliver that you got all these different Gabriel you got Michael they're real they're not fake they're real angels and they're in a faster dimension but they're helping us read your Bible you go read your Bible but it even says right here into an innumerable company of angels so as remember when the lodge in Gaza Lysa could see into another dimension he saw he saw nothing but angels and he said please open guys's eyes Lord just for a minute late and see what's going on and he did and there was one when Elijah said there's more for us than they are against us and there was only two people standing there he saw something that gangs didn't see but as it when he could look in that other dimension by God allowed him to look in the other dimension what he did took the fairway so I think today we need to let take the fear away of anything that's going on let's don't be foolish but let's remember that God's got this whole thing in control I say foolish by means I'm a son of God I'm gonna go stand out in the middle that road and there's nothing gonna hit me no well we'll be doing your funeral you're not gonna have them but there might be an angel they're going like you do that I couldn't I can't stop okay stop the train but you understand what I'm saying let's not be it's not be let's not go over on the other side well whatever I do it doesn't matter you but we're fearful not fearful it's like this we shouldn't fear being the Christian but you need to have just a little bit of godly fear knowing that he's the one is in control so these top conducts look to the General Assembly and the Church of the firstborn a you and I are the Church of the firstborn because what Christ did the firstborn the first one to come up out of the grave which are written in heaven so there you're written in heaven and to God the judge of all and to the spirits of just men made perfect right even Jesus a mediator and the New Covenant and to the blood of sprinkling that speaketh better things than that I'm able to what it was Jesus's blood not the blood of a sacrificed with Abel see that you refuse not him that speaketh for they escaped not who refused him that spake on earth much more shall not we escape if we turn away from him that speaketh from him the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost speaketh from heaven nothing up there but inside here whose voice then shook the earth but now he has promised saying yet once more I shake not the Earth only but also the heaven no we're talking about this time brother man speaks on that he shook the earth at one time now he's going to shake the earth that heaven why is he going to shake it because of us all nature under the stick steel all nature is going to be brought into subjection to the sons of God and this word yet what's more signifying the removing of those things that are shaken as of things that are made that those things which cannot be shaken may remain of what's he saying everything in you you memory the conservation imagination are going to be shook and everything that's going to be shook when on something shades you just come when you shake something what happens two parts fall off alright when you car shakes in that part start falling off alright that's the thing what God doing with us because the way that so easily besets us right no the waves it so easily possesses were supposed to shed it and he may as we read them to hear he may bring something to tension in your life that needs to be shook and he's going to shake what he said you're not a bastard you're a son so he's going to shake you and be thankfull then he shakes you because there's old parts gonna fall off there's old ideas and all these different things are gonna fall off that those things which cannot be shaken may remain that's why this thing's been going on for 60 years after the Prophet God has been shaken the people get rid of the riffraff brother Braun says we're not they begin to say I am my father one of these other things that sho can pull away well watch the show that's that old kind of console idea okay and the old Pentecostal idea is watch out speaking in tongues run out that's what they're wrong I don't mind that but you better know what you're doing first because you know the devil can do all that but he can't be the word he can't be the word he cannot put the word together word for word Sunday by Sunday he cannot do it somewhere he'll go off wherefore we receive we receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved thank God let us have grace whereby we may serve God and step complete with reverence that's what said look and godly fear for our God is a consuming fire and that's what happened at Union birth I believe he brings that consuming fire because watch now remember we'll stop right here but look remember it's a continuation of it's not chap man put the chapters in there but Paul's talking he said God is a continue consuming fire let brotherly love continue because remember a time that brother but now remember what happened that this brotherly love or brotherly kindness when Ananias and Sapphira lied to Peter he said you didn't lie to me you lied to the Holy Ghost and they died because what were they doing brother Brown said brotherly kindness what they happened was is that everything was common they had everything together they brought everything together right and I don't know how since the fire said yes see if they would have answered the question a little bit different they might have been okay but Paul said if you get another word pizza did you give all they said yes Peter Caen says have you give all your going together they said yes they might have been okay but he said if you give all and then I said yes we'd give all but they have held back the part and then what happened was today they died you you now listen you think Brett do you think well that's brother communist I mean your thinking your humanity that's not brotherly kindness that was what that was shaking what we always call shaking the bushes go outside and shake the bushes and all kind of stuff fall down all right that's what God was doing he was shaking the bushes and that's what's happening in them if God turns against you because you're because you're want to hear more of the Word of God and you're going to get it and you get it right so remember before we go there are there are teachers in the message I believe we have some good ones but now some teachers are kindergarten teacher you said when you say teacher you go home no there's kindergarten teachers and as a kindergarten teacher my sister I don't know that she can go teach college the next day no she has to study a little bit more and probably a little bit harder instead of going stop doing that my god do you understand what I mean so is this kindergarten teachers this there's elementary school teachers there's high school teachers and college teachers and a lot of times they don't mix why because it's the people they're dealing with okay so there are teachers out there that teach kindergarten but there are guys they gotta be teachers that teach this college so that well you can stand on your own two feet so the kindergarten you know you can t barley stand on your own two feet ask a man she'll tell you they can't go the bathroom while itself and all this other stuff max listen that's babies so there's teachers that teach babies and then you have to figure out where you are in the body of Christ and figure out where you need to go but remember you gotta have five of them that's gonna be so narrow-minded well we just teaching them so everybody else out no you need an evangelist to come every once in a while watch shake the bushes all right all these different things you need somebody to come by and it takes five but you do need good solid teaching because good solid teaching will take you up this statue of a perfect man it will not I mean regular preaching will not take you up to stuff your ugly looma it may get you born again it may get you to realize you need something but the probably God said teaching places you in the body so I want to be placed because you know what like I said before power without character satanic the Powerball listen we all have the power of the Holy Ghost inside of us to create a world of property God said create it and go live on it but you know what one day we just might be able to do that but right now we're not there's a bar holiness what's that bar that bar is that we you and I gotta have more teaching because power without character I love that quote I don't have character but power web characters fit to rule so you come up here to where Peter can set in a building and discern and I sense the fire or discern the thoughts and intents of the heart and and that's okay that we went through the first poll that remember the clock was talking about boom will go first goal was what taking the people out of hand you know that's why they had to be a prayer line brother branham started prayer lines no one else you can't find it nowhere in history that a prayer line was started by no one else so they'll always tell you brother I'm spearheaded the healing campaign you know why I had a prayer line they're attached to people he couldn't call them out he ever talk to him to any to bring him to a line and grab their hand and all that would happen he had to physically touch him so he lined him up and had prayer line so but now remember that was first pull second pole was what in the toxins into the heart the last clock said he said you go to crisis the mystery of God revealed at the very end of the service he said see the clock he said strike two o'clock he said the second pull is over he said you people don't understand then the second pole is over so no more prayer lines no more discerning the thoughts and intents of the heart in the prayer line the third pole is the opening of the word all right so second pole in 1963 was over his corner brother Ram he said second fold over third pole cam right so weep but a lot of people hadn't moved they kind of stuck in that going around forum you know but let brotherly love continue be not forgetful to entertain strangers for therefore some have entertained angels unaware our let's go Thanks [Music]
