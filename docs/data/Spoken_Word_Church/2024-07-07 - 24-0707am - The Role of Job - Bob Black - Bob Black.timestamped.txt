[0:02] um we finished up the book of Hebrews
[0:04] and I was just uh I I've really been
[0:07] wanting to study this book that I'm
[0:10] going to start today which is kind of an
[0:12] odd book that you would think you know
[0:15] we'd want to study on Daniel or
[0:17] Revelation or something like that but I
[0:19] felt led to study the Book of Job and I
[0:22] don't know how long we'll stay on this
[0:25] might be brief but um uh there's a lot
[0:28] of chapters and it's very wey to get
[0:31] into um but um today we're not going to
[0:34] be using slides I just want to just just
[0:36] talk about it um so if you'll turn in
[0:38] over to to the Book of Job chapter 1 and
[0:41] we'll mainly look at we'll probably
[0:44] start at from verse 20 and read to the
[0:47] end of of the
[0:50] chapter let's just go to the Lord in
[0:52] prayer Lord we're so grateful to be able
[0:54] to gather around your word and to be
[0:55] able to gather together with your people
[0:57] today Lord and we just thank you for all
[0:59] the promise as you've given to us Lord
[1:01] and thank you for the encouragement This
[1:02] Book of Job can give us to us as we go
[1:05] through life struggles and and uh the
[1:07] trying times of life and I pray God that
[1:09] it'll just give us strength strength and
[1:11] encouragement today Lord that you'll
[1:13] just be with your people and be with the
[1:15] service Lord that you'll feel that
[1:16] Liberty to move Among Us Lord Jesus be
[1:18] with brother Chris as he's study and
[1:19] preparing help us now we pray in your
[1:23] name um I think uh let well let's let's
[1:27] read this scripture for we'll start at
[1:29] verse 20
[1:30] um drop all the way down to the end and
[1:33] uh and you think you know as we'll
[1:37] relate in a moment all of this horrible
[1:39] thing all these horrible things that
[1:40] just happened to job and then it says
[1:42] then job arose and rent his mantle and
[1:46] shaved his head and fell down upon the
[1:49] ground and worshiped that seems like an
[1:53] odd thing to do after a lot of bad
[1:54] things have happened to you do to
[1:57] worship and said naked came out of my
[2:00] mother's womb and naked shall I return
[2:03] thither the lord
[2:05] gave and the Lord hath taken away
[2:09] blessed be the name of the Lord in all
[2:12] this job sined not nor charged God
[2:17] foolishly now really you read you read
[2:22] the book of job and it's probably the
[2:24] most depressing book in the
[2:26] Bible you read all these things these
[2:29] horrible things it happened to job and
[2:32] uh but really it's one of the most
[2:34] important books because it frames up how
[2:38] you know we it's got we've got all these
[2:40] questions of life and why do things
[2:42] happen and why are things why are things
[2:43] the way they are but the Book of Job God
[2:46] gave us this book so that we could
[2:48] understand how God runs his program how
[2:51] God runs the world and to answer the
[2:54] questions of life when you get to a spot
[2:55] and you're wondering why why is are
[2:58] things like this why why is it like this
[3:01] well job had a lot of those questions
[3:03] too and it's four friends that came and
[3:06] talked to him and and uh so the Jo The
[3:09] Book of Job helps us to understand
[3:12] things when when we're going through it
[3:13] helps us to frame up like you start
[3:16] thinking maybe that that if you serve
[3:19] God that nothing bad will ever happen to
[3:21] you or you you it helps you understand
[3:24] you know you see all this wicked done in
[3:26] the world and but the wicked seems like
[3:28] they prosper and nothing bad happens to
[3:30] them what what's going on and you know
[3:34] all of us have questions like that it
[3:36] helps job sure did what what what is
[3:39] happening why are things the way they
[3:42] are and Job chapter 14 if you keep
[3:45] reading it says job 14:1 says
[3:49] man that is born of a
[3:52] woman is a few
[3:54] days and full of
[3:57] trouble now that sums sums up a lot
[4:00] doesn't it that life is just full of
[4:05] suffering you know you sit there in the
[4:07] hospital room watching watching all my
[4:09] kids born and you when you come into the
[4:11] world it's it's just
[4:13] terrible watching a baby being born and
[4:16] watching all the labor and the uh the
[4:18] trial and the crying there's crying and
[4:20] suffering tears and the baby comes into
[4:23] the world crying and it's just suffering
[4:26] and you watch them and you sitting there
[4:27] thinking well I better have some
[4:29] insurance because you know what if
[4:30] something happen what if somebody get
[4:31] sick and and and and uh you because life
[4:35] is just full of suffering you see
[4:37] suffering on every hand everywhere you
[4:41] you go to the playground at school and
[4:42] it's suffering kids making fun of one
[4:45] another and and uh not the whole because
[4:49] the whole world is in this sin condition
[4:51] and nothing's the way that it should be
[4:54] and uh plants are dying and the world's
[4:57] getting worse and worse and it's it's
[4:59] and you grow old and and and and there
[5:02] at the end it's just suffering suffering
[5:06] and that's because of what job says
[5:07] there in job 14:1 man that is born of a
[5:11] woman is a few days and full of trouble
[5:13] and I think all of us can bear record if
[5:15] you've lived long at all that you look
[5:18] back in your life and it's full of
[5:20] trouble just trouble on every hand
[5:23] trouble everywhere you look trouble you
[5:26] know even even when you're born again
[5:29] it's
[5:30] suffering I I I I want to tell you when
[5:32] I was born again it was it was not easy
[5:35] you're laying there and you're
[5:36] struggling and you're trying to you
[5:39] there's some there's desperation and
[5:40] you're trying to get somewhere and
[5:42] you're you want God to come on the scene
[5:44] and and and do something and you're not
[5:46] maybe maybe you're in that state where
[5:48] you don't really understand it but you
[5:49] want something to happen you don't know
[5:52] what it what's going to happen but you
[5:53] want something to happen and the whole
[5:55] thing is suffering cuz when life comes
[5:59] and the this life you're just going to
[6:01] have suffering there's suffering in
[6:02] birth there's suffering in the New Birth
[6:04] they're suffering in life and they're
[6:06] suffering as we go down to the grave and
[6:09] now now let's in our mind let's lay
[6:11] aside all that you know that we're going
[6:14] to a Rapture we're going to a body
[6:15] change let's lay that to side for a
[6:17] second and just think about suffering
[6:19] because so far there's been a Ono one
[6:23] everybody that's been born has matched
[6:25] one to one with everybody has gone to
[6:28] the Grave there hadn't been anybody that
[6:30] has escaped going to the Grave because
[6:33] because everything is just suffering
[6:35] your your destiny if if if if we don't
[6:39] come to a body change if you don't come
[6:40] to that place your destiny is going to
[6:43] be going down into the grave because
[6:47] man's days are few and full of
[6:50] trouble now you might ask that question
[6:53] how can you see all that pain and
[6:55] suffering all this pain and suffering
[6:57] this is the one of the questions that
[6:58] the Book of Job answers all this pain
[7:01] and suffering and still be a Christian
[7:05] how can you still how can you look at
[7:07] these things and and and and and still
[7:09] believe in a in a good God and all these
[7:12] kind of things but I I I don't think
[7:15] that we could see and endure all this
[7:17] pain unless we were a Christian now
[7:22] that's right you you see all this all
[7:24] these all these people I I just don't
[7:25] know how people could live out in the
[7:27] world with and endure all the suffering
[7:29] and things and not have the rock of
[7:31] Revelation that we have not have
[7:33] something to hang on to that's what
[7:35] keeps us that's that's what that's what
[7:37] job what job got so
[7:40] low until he said the lord giveth and
[7:42] the lord taketh
[7:44] away but you get so low till everything
[7:48] has been Stripped
[7:49] Away the only thing that remains might
[7:52] be your faith your faith is like your
[7:55] faith like we know in the New Testament
[7:57] is compared to a rock you know you ever
[8:00] you ever been eating a sandwich or
[8:01] something and you hit you bit down on a
[8:03] rock like a little Pebble or something
[8:05] and it and and it's that's how like you
[8:07] you're we're just made up of like a bag
[8:09] of Flesh and water and everything and
[8:11] but down on the inside there's a stone
[8:14] yes a stone that you strip everything
[8:16] else away and All That Remains will be
[8:19] your faith and it's down on the inside
[8:22] and that's what job got Stripped Away
[8:24] until there was nothing left nothing
[8:26] left but I I believe God I know that in
[8:29] My Flesh that I shall see God I know him
[8:33] and and and you could take everything
[8:35] away from job and all that remained was
[8:38] I'm not going to curse God and die like
[8:40] his wife told him to I'm not going to
[8:42] you could take everything away from me
[8:44] but yet I'm going to serve God Amen I
[8:47] don't need wealth or fame or popularity
[8:51] or good place in the community I don't
[8:53] need anything I don't need any reward
[8:56] from God to trust him that was just J's
[8:59] testimony I will serve him no matter
[9:02] what yes see it's it's what I know it's
[9:06] what we know and who we know that
[9:08] carries us through the rough times in
[9:11] Job chapter 19 he said for I know that
[9:15] my redeemer
[9:17] liveth I know my redeemer liveth and
[9:20] that he shall stand at the latter day
[9:22] upon the
[9:23] Earth and though after my skin worms
[9:27] destroy this body yet in My Flesh shall
[9:30] I see
[9:31] God whom I shall see for myself and my
[9:35] eyes Shall Behold and not another though
[9:37] my Reigns be consumed within
[9:41] me Reigns is an old archaic word for
[9:44] your kidneys because they believed in
[9:46] the old old timey days that your kidneys
[9:48] is where that source of all of your your
[9:51] your your inner you
[9:53] know if everything Stripped Away that he
[9:56] KN he still had that confidence that
[9:59] Christ is at the end of the road now
[10:01] that's what our confidence is when
[10:03] everything's Stripped Away and you feel
[10:04] like you just can't keep going on and
[10:07] and and and all just you're compassed
[10:10] about with suffering on every side but
[10:13] Christ is at the end of the road
[10:16] now loss and pain and suffering usually
[10:21] comes with a lot of questions and that's
[10:24] why this book of Job is the book that
[10:27] has the most questions out out of any
[10:30] book of the Bible there's
[10:32] 330 questions in this book and the and
[10:36] the most of any other book might be
[10:38] Matthew or some of the others have like
[10:40] maybe 150 questions something like that
[10:42] but this book has more questions because
[10:45] when you're going through a rough time
[10:47] when you're going through trial you're
[10:49] going to have a lot of
[10:51] questions like why
[10:53] me why why is this happening to me or
[10:57] why them or why now or why this like job
[11:03] job asked there was a lot of questions
[11:05] in the Book of Job like why why do the
[11:08] wicked live on Growing Old and
[11:09] increasing in
[11:11] power that's a good question to look at
[11:13] you look at somebody else why some look
[11:16] at somebody evil people in political
[11:19] positions of power people in government
[11:21] and it looks like they don't care about
[11:23] writing wrong why are they prospering it
[11:25] looks like the righteous are going
[11:27] through such hard times and
[11:30] the righteous get abused like little
[11:32] lambs they get thrown over to the side
[11:34] of the way and looks like the devil just
[11:36] runs a rough shot over them what what's
[11:38] going on why is it like
[11:41] that in Job chapter 11 can you God ask
[11:44] job this question or uh this question is
[11:47] asked of him can can you fathom the
[11:48] mysteries of God can you probe the
[11:51] limits of the
[11:52] almighty and Job 38 where were you when
[11:55] I laid the found Earth's
[11:58] Foundation tell me if you understand and
[12:02] God was asking job that question to kind
[12:04] of frame up in his mind you think you
[12:05] think you understand you think you know
[12:09] and we think we know sometimes but
[12:12] sometimes there's just not a good
[12:14] answer that might be the summation of
[12:16] the Book of Job sometimes you just got
[12:19] to trust
[12:21] God in Job 38 have you ever given orders
[12:24] to the morning or shown the dawn its
[12:27] place does the rain have a father who
[12:29] fathers the drops of dew know every
[12:32] morning you get up and you can see dew
[12:34] falling on the grass and there's where
[12:37] does it come from how does it happen and
[12:39] you sometimes you just got to trust God
[12:42] oh yeah the god that makes the Dew fall
[12:44] on the grass that same God is is running
[12:47] things the way he wants to and that same
[12:49] God is running your life if you'll just
[12:52] trust him and turn everything over to
[12:54] him and trust that he's at the end of
[12:56] the
[12:57] road Jo got a lot of questions in it cuz
[13:01] we have a lot of questions when we go
[13:02] through
[13:03] suffering yet job such a strange story
[13:06] cuz it's the opposite of a rags to Rich
[13:09] a story we we like we like the Disney
[13:12] sto kind of stories you know where
[13:13] somebody starts out with nothing and
[13:15] they end up with everything but this
[13:17] this now now just laid the ending to the
[13:19] side for a moment but this is a story
[13:21] about somebody that had everything and
[13:24] it all got Stripped Away and that's
[13:27] where something really happened you
[13:29] could really see you can really see
[13:30] somebody's Faith shine when everything's
[13:33] Stripped
[13:34] Away and that's what makes it bothersome
[13:37] why would all these calamities befall a
[13:41] righteous
[13:42] man if something bad was going to happen
[13:46] it shouldn't have happened to job job
[13:48] was doing everything right job was
[13:51] making sacrifices for his children job
[13:54] was job was an upstanding citizen of the
[13:56] land job was doing everything according
[13:59] exactly according to plan he was doing
[14:01] everything right why would why would
[14:03] something bad happen to job why would
[14:06] all this T and not just something bad
[14:08] but everything possible bad everything
[14:11] that could happen to job happened to him
[14:14] except for his life taken away he had
[14:16] every even his wife was saying won't you
[14:18] just Curse God and die everything was
[14:20] taken away from
[14:22] it why do the righteous
[14:24] Suffer Well one reason is because they
[14:26] can take it and and see we we we've got
[14:30] to take it because The Crucible of life
[14:34] is where our character is molded and
[14:37] framed into the way that God wants us to
[14:39] be it's it's The Crucible of life that
[14:42] forms our character character is the
[14:44] thing that we're coming out of life with
[14:46] the character is the thing you'll go
[14:47] into the other world with and character
[14:50] when you go through all these things it
[14:51] just strips away everything everything
[14:54] except for the kind of Godly character
[14:56] that want God wants to see then he can
[14:59] look at you and see well well that
[15:01] person is responding to situations in
[15:03] the right way he's looking he's trusting
[15:06] me no matter what comes no matter what
[15:08] happens he's trusting me the the fiery
[15:11] Crucible like in Proverbs chapter 17 it
[15:14] says the fining pot oh yeah is for
[15:17] silver and the furnace for gold but the
[15:21] Lord trith the
[15:24] hearts you know in that message the e as
[15:27] the eagle stirreth their nest brother
[15:29] brandom used this story as an example of
[15:32] how God tries his Eagles tries his Eagle
[15:36] he'll put you through a little fire to
[15:39] see if you're going to spread your wings
[15:42] or not he wants to he wants to put you
[15:44] in a little situation to see if you're
[15:46] going to spread your wings and Soar Off
[15:48] the mountain toop or how you're going to
[15:52] react oh in Isaiah 48:10 he said behold
[15:56] I have refined thee but not with silver
[15:59] I have chosen thee in the furnace of
[16:04] Affliction now that's the part of
[16:06] Christianity we don't like in it that
[16:08] we're chosen in the furnace of
[16:12] Affliction Christianity is not a flowery
[16:14] bed of ease is it life is not a flowy B
[16:16] of ease it it's straight up terrible
[16:19] it's terrible many times it's horrible
[16:22] oh but that's where you can have
[16:24] something real real beautiful you can't
[16:27] have a you can't have a rose without a
[16:29] thorn you got to have the Thorns first
[16:31] and then you got a rose you you got to
[16:33] have all the Pricks and everything
[16:35] before you get the rose but then you got
[16:37] a rose that smells good and you can see
[16:39] the fragrance coming
[16:41] out in Malachi chapter 3 he shall sit as
[16:44] a refiner and purifier of silver and he
[16:47] shall purify the sons of Levi and purge
[16:50] them as gold and silver that they may
[16:54] offer unto the Lord an offering and
[16:57] righteousness
[16:59] and you think about all the things in
[17:00] your life that must be refined
[17:03] away all your pride and your arrogance
[17:07] and your
[17:07] self-reliance all mine has to be refined
[17:11] away all of our worldliness and Reliance
[17:15] on the world and love of the world and
[17:17] our materialism has got to be refined
[17:21] away all of our doubt our lack of faith
[17:24] has got to be refined away yes sir that
[17:27] where we trust God no matter what
[17:30] happens all of our impure
[17:32] motives all of our sinful habits and
[17:35] behaviors and all of our lukewarmness
[17:38] has got to be refined away where we come
[17:41] to church and we don't care and we don't
[17:43] care about one another it's got to be
[17:44] refined away and you know what'll take
[17:46] care of where you don't have empathy and
[17:49] where you don't have that kind of
[17:50] character is where you go through a
[17:52] little refining fire Let the Fire of God
[17:56] mold you and move you and you'll all of
[17:59] that will be baked out where there's no
[18:02] hypocrisy left where there's no somebody
[18:06] that can't forgive their brother you go
[18:08] through some hard times and then you
[18:10] look at your brother a little bit
[18:11] differently right your impatience and
[18:14] all of your lack of compassion has got
[18:16] to be refined out it's got to be fired
[18:19] out that's why you know we we go through
[18:22] life and we we're mocked and shamed you
[18:25] might be shamed because of the way you
[18:27] dress and the way that you live you
[18:29] might be made fun of you think think
[18:32] about all the times you in school you
[18:34] were bullied and made fun of and maybe
[18:36] as a Christian bully those are thing
[18:39] situations that God allowed you to go
[18:41] through and it's hard and it's it's
[18:43] rough and the situations in life they're
[18:46] terrible but they're for a purpose to
[18:48] bring you to a place and you go through
[18:51] tragedy and sorrow and heartache where
[18:54] you just feel like you're just ripped
[18:56] apart and you're just being crushed in
[18:58] the wine press of God's Wrath and you
[19:01] just can't hardly bear it anymore like
[19:03] Jesus there in the Garden of Gethsemane
[19:05] where his he's so so much stress until
[19:08] his blood and his and the water was
[19:11] separated from the blood and he was
[19:13] dripping out great great drops because
[19:16] because of the stress and God will allow
[19:18] us to go through times where we we just
[19:20] can't even sleep at night wake up at
[19:23] 3:00 in the morning and you're like what
[19:25] what's going on this doesn't seem like a
[19:28] a nice Christian peaceful life that I
[19:31] thought it would
[19:32] be and God allows these
[19:35] things because we've got to be
[19:39] refined now you look at Job chap
[19:42] 1:9 as we're about to close
[19:45] here and this is this is the scripture
[19:49] that the whole book of Job hangs on
[19:51] because this is the question that's got
[19:54] to be answered and this is the question
[19:56] that's got to be answered in your life
[19:59] Satan answered the
[20:01] Lord after the Lord pointed out job what
[20:04] about job all these all these things
[20:06] were playing out in that Divine counsel
[20:08] in heaven Satan answered the Lord and
[20:10] said doth job fear God for
[20:16] not now that's a a very strange question
[20:19] but the question that's being posed
[20:21] is it does does job just does he fear
[20:25] God just because he's expecting to get
[20:28] something
[20:30] what about you and
[20:32] I if the flly we bit of ease is yanked
[20:35] away from us are we still going to trust
[20:39] God if that thing that you hold most
[20:42] precious is yanked away from you what
[20:44] what about you are you going to still
[20:45] trust
[20:47] God a refined believer will serve God
[20:51] for
[20:53] nothing I don't have to get nothing in
[20:56] return I don't have to get any money
[20:59] a refined believer will serve God for no
[21:03] popularity if everybody in the church
[21:06] hates you if everybody in the world
[21:08] hates you you'll still serve
[21:11] God a refined believer will serve God
[21:15] for no
[21:16] money preachers don't
[21:20] oh it's we're not preaching the gospel
[21:22] for
[21:23] money what what if we didn't get
[21:26] paid what if we didn't get any money
[21:29] would we still serve God you got to
[21:32] serve God for nothing no gold no silver
[21:35] what if all of your family turned
[21:38] against you and all of your family said
[21:40] the way that you should believe is is
[21:42] heresy but you're not serving God for
[21:44] family you're serving God for
[21:47] nothing no happiness that's right no
[21:51] shelter what if your shelter was taken
[21:52] away and you like Jesus they had nowhere
[21:55] to lay his head nothing but the dens
[21:57] nothing nothing
[21:59] but no church no congregation what if
[22:01] you had nothing what if all the church
[22:03] doors were closed would you still serve
[22:06] God job
[22:08] did everything was yanked away from job
[22:11] and he had nothing left and he said the
[22:15] lord giveth and the lord taketh away
[22:17] blessed be the name of the Lord no
[22:19] matter what Satan does to me no matter
[22:22] what God does to me I'm still going to
[22:24] serve
[22:25] God and job 1:12 said and the Lord said
[22:28] unto Satan behold all that he hath is in
[22:31] thy power only upon himself put not
[22:35] forth thine
[22:37] hand and so all job had left was ashes
[22:42] now you think about that that's all job
[22:45] had was ashes and he still was willing
[22:46] to serve god with nothing but ashes
[22:49] nothing but ashes and a little pot shirt
[22:51] a little piece of a broken pot to to
[22:54] satis itching like crazy itching like
[22:57] mad and just wanted some belief and
[22:59] there in his Despair and his suffering
[23:01] with his wounds oozing all he had to do
[23:03] was just scrape scrape and scrape and
[23:05] scrape on that on that pile of ashes and
[23:07] he had nothing left but his faith and he
[23:10] wouldn't he wouldn't let that
[23:12] go you think about all that God allowed
[23:15] to be taken away 7,000 sheep and 3,000
[23:19] camels and 500 Yol of oxen and 500
[23:23] donkeys and all of his servants and his
[23:26] children seven sons and three daughters
[23:28] and then he in chapter in in Job chapter
[23:31] 2 all of his health was taken away so he
[23:33] didn't even have his health and all of
[23:36] his social standing and respect where
[23:38] all of his friends came around and began
[23:40] to mock him and say you're the one
[23:42] you're the problem you're the reason why
[23:44] this happened wow all of it was taken
[23:47] away and job 2:8 says and he took him a
[23:50] pot shirt to scrape himself with and he
[23:53] sat down among the
[23:56] ashes and his wife said unto him Dost
[23:58] thou still retain thine Integrity Curse
[24:02] God and die all job had were ashes and
[24:08] misery and he still served God
[24:13] Amen a righteous life is not an easy
[24:16] life now sometimes we look for when when
[24:20] when Calamity befalls us or bad things
[24:23] happen we look for a simple answer a
[24:25] simple reason for why it's happening and
[24:29] I'm about to close but in John 9: 1:3
[24:34] Jesus explains sometimes it's not as
[24:37] simple as somebody made a mistake and
[24:39] there're that's why they're they're in a
[24:42] you know something bad happens he said
[24:44] as as Jesus passed by he saw a man which
[24:46] was blind from his
[24:48] birth and his disciples asked him saying
[24:50] master who did Sin this man or his
[24:53] parents that he was born blind and Jesus
[24:56] answered neither hath this man Sinn nor
[24:58] his
[24:59] parents but that the works of God should
[25:01] be made manifest in
[25:03] it and the message of the Ark brother R
[25:06] said you might be sick for a little
[25:07] while you may have to go through
[25:09] something for a little while but
[25:11] remember Christ is at the
[25:14] end he never said this artc will set in
[25:17] a little Whirlpool like that well
[25:19] there'll be no calm just as calm as it
[25:21] can be no sir he never carried a flower
[25:24] bed of ease he never promised things
[25:27] easy
[25:29] but he promised Grace to sustain you in
[25:32] the time there's no promise well let me
[25:37] skip over that and we'll we'll go to the
[25:39] end here and close on this close on this
[25:44] thought that right there in the midst of
[25:47] all that
[25:48] trial when everything had been Stripped
[25:51] Away that it says that job
[25:55] worshiped and you know true worship
[25:59] comes from knowing god and job knew his
[26:03] maker and John chapter 4:24 says God is
[26:07] a spirit and they that worship Him must
[26:08] worship Him in spirit and in
[26:12] truth so you can't worship without the
[26:15] truth in Matthew chapter 15 it says for
[26:18] in vain they worship me teaching for
[26:20] doctrines the Commandments of men so
[26:22] your worship is wrong if you're not
[26:24] worshiping according to the
[26:26] truth but if you have have the
[26:29] truth that surpasses
[26:32] everything if everything's taken away
[26:35] and you've got the truth then you can
[26:38] worship God bless you we'll leave you
[26:40] with that thought
[26:44] [Applause]
