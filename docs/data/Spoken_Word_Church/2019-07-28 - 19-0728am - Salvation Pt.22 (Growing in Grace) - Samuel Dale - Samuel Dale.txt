for your grace in your life your love and your understanding because without those what good would like me for anything in any of us we just ask you to help us today to minister your word to speak what you would have to be said and to open our eyes to that understanding that we may walk in you let's all of these that are missing the ministers the different ones Lord and all the sick you know you just be with each one the resounding touches just be with all of us here they may our hearts and all be gathered together in love for you forgive our sins because we want to be covered and we ask you to just bless and guide each one that your love being here because that's what we need more than anything is your love in your grace guide us and keep us in Jesus name and visions too for by grace are you saved through faith and that not of yourselves it is the gift of God amen now let's go to second Peter 3:17 is therefore beloved seeing you know these things before beware lest you also being led away with the error of the wicked fall from your fall from your own steadfastness now once how would we keep from doing that because he says it can be done you know be careful it can be done you know since but grow in grace and in the knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ to him be glory both now and forever you may be seated the Lord at his blessing to the reading of the word now we were trying to bring out the last message last couple of messages we've been speaking on basically talking of adoption you know covering how that Paul covers in Galatians that we're all children you know born if you're a born-again believer today you're born to get in Christ and that makes you a baby in Christ it doesn't make us full-grown to just to be born again that's where the problem with people they think they don't know anything about growing in grace and knowledge they just think well I'm born again I got it all well that's not true according to the Bible not true according to the prophets message it only made us babies in Christ and Galatians says that we as been babies then God gives us a tutor which is the baptism of the Holy Ghost gives it to us at the new birth all right that makes our soul eternal puts us into the place to where that we can begin to grow in God but it doesn't come all at once it comes over a gradual basis to grow into Israel that was that was there and today will be a review up to a spot and the Lord willing on Wednesday we'll try to get into the statue of a perfect man to try to cover some of those thoughts but just keep these things in mind that ever ever person that is born again now the disciples they were two to three and a half years and when the Holy Ghost fell on them it could position them in the stature of a perfect man into the position with the virtues they did not have the headstone because it had not come yet the prophet said all right so they're up to you know they came to that place but they could teach others and that's what we'll get back to showing Paul and Peter is basically teaching us you know how to grow in grace and knowledge whereas Paul is giving us the scriptural type of a background because being like he was and and all in the depth of his understanding and he'd go back and pick up the things and bring them out here comes Peter along as I keep emphasizing that because I want you to think on it that Peter comes along and he kind of tells you how it's done and what it takes to do the things to grow in grace and knowledge all right so then that's putting us into a position as to be the children of God all right now so we're all born again babies desiring the sincere milk of the word that we may grow thereby we may think we're grown up but you know that's not so in God so no neither trying to to make something out of it that we're not just be what we are we're just a bunch of babies I don't like the v-- call the baby orient me call you a grown baby you know an old baby what do you want me to call you and I'm just I'm satisfied to be called a babe in Christ because that's wonderful as I emphasized there the other day you know the greatest thing in the world could be is to think about being a child of God what an opportunity in life to be is a child of God if he just leaves me as a child I'd be fine you just put me to her I'll still be there they have to go by the grave or something because that I can't reach the position to where I can be changed but that's alright I'll be there mister cleaner used to say you know and say said if I die and go on for you all this beats you up so that's that's a good way of saying this he's no we're gonna beat this up cause he's gonna raise before we do cuz they house the dead has to rise and then you know and we works are alive and remain alright so you understand the point of what we've been driving at Galatians covers in showing that the child is err it's just as much error is is you know as you all the children other signs there much that much error then Romans covers it you know there were hours and joint-heirs all right so then whatever Jesus Christ has that's what we have and just as a baby in Christ we have a great opportunity now remember the story we'll back it up Wednesday a little more but remember that the son as long as he's a son when he's born he's born a son he's a child of God he has eternal life in his soul all right now having that eternal life then that makes him to a place to say you know to cry father and to cry out unto God to want more and to drink the sincere milk of the word alright you know I love the way brother Branham preaches if you ever noticed this even at the Tabernacle you know I kind of watched his stages the way he does things and coming through because that's part of this part of me you know alright but if you'll notice you'll have a series of we call them deep style message you know he's bringing out some some neat things all right and he'll run a series through on that well the next time he comes back by you see him he looks like he just drops back and he's preaching simple to fly you know things and and going from there and that may be preaching the same sermon over going back over it and covering it you know and doing like that and especially when he would go out then he would just preach outside you know a smaller form of the message and not go into the deeper but more he laid it down pretty deep even in the small amount because that's what I've been trying to get you to see that we think we know this we think we know that but you know the new birth was the first message Jesus preached and here we're 50 years down the road after the Prophet left and we're still still talking about the new birth well you know it's still interesting to me might not be to you but it's still I've enjoying it because I'm thinking about my growth development all right so then it goes up into Galatians to pick up to work that the air as long as he's a child and he's born that's how he's more than a son now that son may never come to a full maturity but he's still the son you can't take away his inheritance you see yeah but I read where the Prophet said you know how no inheritance you know well you don't have the full inheritance until you attain unto it right but you're born the child which gives you eternal life and that child if it never reached any adoption or form in the Old Testament it was still a child it still could stay right there with Daddy and mama and in a lot of respects sometimes look like it would be better did you stay with our than to go out as some of them had to and fight out all the enemies you know they were going and they'd been nice to this day well mom and daddy you don't and just let them fear them and took care of them but that's not made for everything he is a God wants his children to grow okay now so you see what I'm what I'm saying I got my notes working kind of follow you she threw the revealing of the word we will find more and more as we go along that it's through the revealing of the word that we're babies drinking the sincere milk of the word it's a growth development you grow by what you eat right naturally speaking we grow as we eat spiritually speaking we grow as we eat what as the word into our hearts and lives and that's what I want to make sure that we follow a point you know before then we'll pick up in the stature of a perfect man as the newborn babes at faith all right but my point has been of one thing on the last couple of messages trying to get us to see the way we are and way everything's working and how that we're not great big old kids we may be it may be like I was in school you know though and we you know back then you didn't go to much well we had a couple old boys in our class that was they were both of them bigger than the teacher they were still in our class like fifth sixth or something you know great and they were still there all right because they they didn't grow too much well all right but those there were still babies so never forget that when we come to her and where you come to read brother Brennan will say see there you come this you're born in a family but said if you don't go you don't have an inheritance now he is not talking about the inheritance of eternal life he's not talking about a certain growth development in Christianity he's talking about the adoption of stages that is to come on and to develop that person to a place that you could be adopted these cars were born into the family that doesn't end it that's where brethren said there's where Pentecost failed thinking that they got everything when they were born again now I've got about five or six quotes laying right here we're brother says the day you're born again he said you got everything you need then he turned around til the Pentecost was their mistake was was what cabbage down on that right see they believed that they got it all oh they were happy rejoicing everything was wonderful and they thought they had everything but they cabbage down on that they didn't go on and grow and they wouldn't listen to him as he was trying to bring the message to him right oh they wanted him with the gifts the signs the wonders and all like that the the things that was going on but they didn't want him when he started preaching the word and what was the preaching a word a lot of time her dress clothes they couldn't even follow their own setup of doctrine or leash you you know what I mean the Azusa Street Pentecost at least or the been born-again Christians well you know but Paul says you need somebody to teach you again see that's what the Prophet was trying to do was to teach them and they loved it up to a degree but then they just back up and that ended that point okay see we can do that point he never said they wouldn't Christians he called them Christians right and I'm glad to find that true you say oh he was just didn't want to hurt her feelings when God told him to say it he didn't care whose feelings got hurt right okay so just leave that out of it to think you know well he pitted it he didn't pet him he laid it down spoke strong and straight but they couldn't swallow what he was saying so he had to move on alright CNN and following that to the word all right now listen so the new birth then makes you a child of God giving you eternal life in your soul but it doesn't put you into the fullness of your inheritance it gives you the right of inheritance to sonship that child is born as I said into a family it had a right of inheritance to certain degrees daddy didn't just take him throw him out they had a certain degrees in certain ways and things you know but yet they didn't go on to their full inheritance of the adoption alysha's okay now that's what we need to do is to think about growing in grace and knowledge eating the word until we become the word all right and what was it the Prophet gain see he says things that you know you said what I just don't know I don't say that we get our own idea of what we think the Bible is saying or the Prophet is saying we get that in their own ideas and then something that said I just don't see why you say it's out of way well you know why cause it was the truth how can you explain to babies you know no I mean our kids come up and eating pretty good was but after a while you know you can give a kid something what he likes that you know well then you take it back away from him and say oh you're not old enough to eat that well it's hard for that little feller to understand it called he liked the taste of it and their doings and that's the way we are in our Christianity but now remember I want to emphasize this point because of that Wednesday in god the problem is not as much how can I say it it's not as much that we have the problems it's not that way God understands that he understands our problems in her ways it's the point that we lack things that's why when we get to it in Peters are where it says talks about faith virtue or knowledge temperance patience gone and only and said he that lacketh these things is blind right he's it like all right the problem with us to me this is way I look at it I look at it them the things that we like we like it you know not only like we we don't have it the word lot all right and season when brother Brandon would come along and preach things to us he would preach knock doors endured I remember that I remember going through those services and you know listening and things like that to doors and doors and he's talking about born-again Christians he says he is the belt with the baptism of the Holy Ghost and he says we got this little place over here he said we got that door closed they said we got this over here and got that door closed well she didn't I have my thoughts it's be into the basis of what that when you receive the baptism with Holy Ghost it ought to clean out everything all right that's true with dr. foolish all right because brother branham when he gets interested in the doors and doors check it listen he don't talk about you being drinking alcohol running around with women lying cheating stealing he's not talking about that he's talking about little things that we don't have enough patience we don't have enough faith we don't have enough this that or the other and he said we have the door closed to keep us from being able to receive those things that are forgot to move into so it's not the point that we've got so much dirty wrong with us it's the point that we're lacking things all right now are you fatherly that's what I've been trying to ask a couple of messages to try to get that point to us all right because see you get into the statue of a perfect man well it comes over to our two patients and in our patients gets pretty thin what well and it was get on those hours of temperance well I don't know tempura better unsaid temperance he says that uncontrollable temper when he's talking about Christians number brother Dale I know because Christians don't have temper oh you got a lot to learn if that's all you know you got a lot to learn about your Christian life if that's all you think that you don't have no temper because when your face gets red that pretty well means you new tempers stirred all right but do you understand now watch what I'm trying to get it run around them into doors and doors serious it takes about 810 or something listen to him he's not talking about the bad sinful things he's not talking about you going to door opening and iris adultery you don't mind or nice you know stealing he's not into that he's into little simple everyday life right see because we take brother branham and we'll read it where he says that when that Holy Ghost comes in he said that burned out everything then the next message he says you get born again you get your true credit he said and and we got a little bitterness we got a little this or we got a little that now don't forget my point you'll see when I get over in the message and you blank out and you can't remember the point don't forget to point brother branham on those doors in doors is not talking about that you're a born-again Christian in the body of Christ but yet you still commit adultery you still lie cheat and steal and things cuz that's him little compartments that we know no he's not talking like that he's talking about the little bitty foxes that the Bible says that spoils the vine he's talking about this and we can we can put that into a basis and try to move it around and we can say and there's a truth to it it's no longer I this that's bother it's the Spirit that's within me that spirit is is doing these things alright that's true but remember the doors and doors is not the spirit the doors endures is in the soul see you say well brother Dale you know boys just easy it's hard this can be to try to preach the truth then a doctrinal issue or a thing of two souls or something like ads not too hard for you but when you get down to the nitty-gritty of where we're living out you know to where that we see we've got these problems because if we don't have the virtues we like the virtues right and if we lack them and don't have them we're going to be responsible for that because God has given us the time and the message to bring forth these things to show us all right what's the a baby like I always say you know you got the little baby it's standing there about two three years old it's got cookie all over his face and it's got one in each hand and you say did you get that cooking my uh uh uh no will you say well that little are well how does God look at our little time maybe he looks at us sometimes and said that little our you know especially when so I said well I got no problems well I ain't got no problems what's the trouble why are we still here let's see a baby it is a baby now don't misunderstand this illustration but a baby is expected to be a baby right now in Christianity don't say it's expected to be no now we're the one who's caused the problem whether you want to talk about your body your spirit your soul or whatever I'm a unit and I have troubled little brother down you have problem you know we're human as long as we're in this brother Brown said we'll be a what he said will be a sticker well one time he says everything's gone it's all out everything gone ah dude and the next message you say or maybe in that same message you said see there see we just a bunch of babies and said we'll be a sticker until we're changed well see we can come up and try to to smooth that out by saying it's in the spirit realm and I'm the one that backed for all the years has talked it like that true because I believe it I believe we have trouble in our spirit realm right let's see as Christians born-again believers babies we have trouble in that soul because remember the virtues is not to divert shoes as we'll get to it later faith virtue or not that's a birth in the soul the new birth is not a birth in your body or your spirit the new birth is the birth of the soul all right so you're not born to get in your body not morning any spirit you're born again in your soul all right see in Satan tries to come back no no that's what we were saying them now to you right now what would you call it what would you call it and you have a little problem that's where I try my best to explain something and get into trouble with it trying to explain a Christian life but yet can still have problems that's been the hardest thing for me to try to get across to all of us all of us to where we can see that it takes place like that right the word we have little problems see then what do you need the statue a perfect man for if you don't have problems we're gonna find more of ever that it's a lack of these things it's lack of the point of letting God lead us do you understand our childish things he knows all about our lives in time and he knows that we can't conquer sight don't you ever think you can you ever think you can conquer Satan or Satan don't bother he's already got you he's not bothering you he's got you that's what a man told me at work diner he said I'm working on commanding the Lord's that ain't working I mean commit you're commanding the Lord ain't working on command in the devil I doesn't got him under control I just said it so long buddy we didn't have much more to talk about because if he was that way and he gave me scripture the Bible says command Jimmy now what if somebody comes up to you tell the Bible says for us to command the Lord the userís command you that doesn't mean command like you demand that means if you ask god here's a plain old simple illustration if you ask God for something you need to have patience wait on him to fulfill it right it's just waiting on him the fullfilling do what he wants to all right okay trying to get to the point of what we're talking about see there's were babies the Prophet done the most marvelous thing I mean to me he could explain things and that's where I've tried to emphasize that over and over and over where he says when you're a born-again Christian he said it's like that you have a little spot about the size of this little white button see we say oh my soul is completely full of the Holy Ghost who were you that make you God that would not make you you that would make you God if God is so full like we think of us being so full of the Holy Ghost but yet it's the truth that what we have in us is eternal life and we try to make a button out of it or something that's ways of expressing it it's not the here's your soul is here and right over here is all this eternal cause that's all see we get into all philosophies and us call it philosophies because we get in their own ideas about something that is saying and that's where the trouble is with the Bible sin done I mean I can prove to you in the Bible that you baptize the name Father Son and Holy Ghost that's right it's in the Bible right but-but-but-but now now that's not now you're trying you're having to interpolate your thoughts into the subject to word that you're coming up too well Lord Jesus Christ his father son holy college now you're getting it right what you came to now the Bible says father son Holy Ghost if you do then you got a problem of your own it said that we got to let the Holy Ghost in interpret that to us and bring it out to where that we can see that father son Holy Ghost is Lord Jesus cross and I heard the prophets seen that about water baptism and that's the way I baptized to baptize when you first order about ties you in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost I say it never baptism what I say to do that I must baptize you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ that's the only wearing baptized according to Matthew 28:19 it's the baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ right this is it gets to be where it gets clear all right but see you don't have any problems of life and then you wonder what causes that well you know I thought something wrong we're not talking about adultery so we're not talking about stealing lying cheating them I mean the Christian is not supposed to do them times if the we do them things we ain't a Christian Right see but now small things you say well are are you trying to justify the things that we do a little time no I'm trying to get us to find out we got them then we find out we got them then we can do something about them if you don't believe you got them that's a bad way to say god I'm against but if you don't believe you got the problem then you won't never work on the problem brother Dale here he's got some little little small something that he does I agree we but I look back at you and say you've got little things that you did that you don't need to do now you gonna tell me you don't then we're gonna go to the Prophet and we're gonna pick it out or what he's saying he said do we backslide he said every day so do we sin he said every day well he meant he meant that for y'all not for himself okay that's fine with me I don't agree with it but that's fine with me it's still right because we have problems every day in their everyday life all right you tell me why that prophet said that about that fellow you know it's picking on him in that cafe or something no one telling him he was William Bryan was so much wrong and all like that some of the other started he said no said I he said I wanted him myself now you tell me he wasn't a human that's what caught me what caught me was not a man that was so great until he never done nothing home he just won't so though this isn't there were nothing no well caught me was the man telling all that code I could read the Bible the Bible told me about Abraham at lied and give his wife away and and they come up with a son and his son farted right in his footsteps you said well that was boars born in that's true so we don't go around giving a wise way right but sometimes we might think about it oh now brother Dale I'm simply trying to illustrate okay you tell me and I'm not telling it right I'm just gonna life in your face you say well I don't never have no problem it's like I've always said I wouldn't care for my wife to know my thoughts all day long that I think if you just remember the one thought that followed everything I love her she's my wife that solves that problem all those words and thoughts in your mind at the end of the day ended up by saying I love you might solve a lot of problems that's the last thing we do when we go to bed I love you like I've always said you're not human though like I've always saying even if you got it going honey I love you you know okay you get what I'm talking about I'm talking about being a Christian I'm talking about the way your prophet was explaining a Christian life that in the message Messiah that he brought and many more of what I'm laid out they talk about that little button being in there and he says in there you got the doors closed you got problems but he says you that you need to let that button grow it just keeps growing that's the part I love that it don't stay a little button it starts growing that's the stature of a perfect man is it starts growing it starts a growth development and that's through the opening of the word we receive daily if we're not further up the road from from things you know do it then don't talk about being a Christian or not a question I'm not talking about it come on get it right I'm not talking about the Prophet explaining some kind of an adulteress that it's okay to do that cause you're Christian that ain't what I'm talking about he's against that and tells it right but he says you got a little bitter in this well then no no I've been taught all of my life that that everything went out of me how many doors you got closed well I never heard it like that cuz I'll always believe that when you got born again you just washed out clean your prophet starts off with a little bitty button not that size he calls that eternal life just remember one thing your soul is you your soul is you and God has to work on me you to get rid of things and a lot of it to get rid of things we didn't even know we had get rid of little things maybe we didn't know we had that's why I love the message like it is it's not a just a bunk and a hammer you over the head drive it down and if you if you even as much as have a dirty talk your love you can't have to talk come on I was the one that brought him up help me will and my first Christian my life he said you can't have the salt coming well you've heard the story you can't help the birds flying over your head but just keep them from building a nest right brother Dale you're you're you're talking light and these kids is listening these kids know he move more than I do don't maybe that's our problem our kids follow us every day and see our lives so we should walk everyday is the best that we can we yet realized for one thing for certain we cannot conquer the devil I don't care what you think you can't do it but run said nobody is a match for the devil no that is worth a Christian he said that little button he said it starts growing we you know where it's growing in the soul the soul is you come on church it's not then you got this over here and this over here you got to the little engines choir compartment you got a soul down in here see that we try to define those time and the Prophet said the best way he could describe it was that it when you got the new birth it was like a little button inside of your soul he said then that begins to grow what's it growing them it's growing in me and I've always tried to tell you I listened to people talk about the change of the body nothing I really get the wrong idea I'm sorry I hear people preachers preaching on the chain and it's like it starts out here and works its way around here that just gets getting bigger and bigger and bigger and that while it just covers all the old changes covers all over no that's not they don't start out here it starts in here and work from end are out here so we won't anything out here we better start working on what's in the dark and listen to the prophet describing that when you got that little button he said there's some bitterness there's some price when a man is converted see that little white button starts in the heart that little white button he said that's eternal life well what's he trying to make our old into our soul like the little white button would you agree let that button grow out until it's like the apples on a tree what does it do how does it get there because the tree keeps drinking drinking drinking drinking that's how God gets to that each and every one of us through that part of drinking drinking drinking studying the message praying Ron gave me a thing and I'll just read his comment and he's listening let me read a comment of a Christian when he talks about what we're trying to do I especially like Strong's definition of good and perfect he said good means agreeable and upright perfect means the mature complete or full grown that's what I love about what you've been preaching that God gives us that small part of him at the start of our journey and we continue maturing and we would continue nurturing it by believing reading the Bible pray come to church cast down our own ideas about the word in that button our word we have received will grow into us to the full stature of Jesus Christ what a beautiful redemption plan you'll see that's that's the point the little button is what's growing inside of you it's not to just say that this much of my soul is eternal now but one of these days of eternal no it's saying we're going to grow up in these virtues it's going to be Jesus Christ Apostle Paul said it's not our that liveth but Christ that liveth in me it's just Trading trying to get us to see the little button to where we can follow in brother Brennan says what happens you drink in and the Holy Spirit pushes out see that just starts taking over until our soul is completely captivated by the Holy Spirit right until that we have become what we need to be he says then if we keep eating ever individual in here that's received the baptism of the Holy Ghost or you're planted in Christ hallelujah a Holy Ghost baptism then even the rapture is in you but run said the rapture is in you mean where's eternal life in you well you mean we got eternal life but we need more eternal life will you explain it you know it's humanly impossible to determine a lot of things you just got to say it and believe it the new birth inside of you makes your soul eternal but there's problems in that soul that are human beings have that we yield ourselves to the devil on a lot of things and it's him trying to come back what do you mean it's okay for me to do these things what I need to I gave you the definition the prophets said the way back for a backslider is the same way back as for a sinner to come to Christ what is that repent accept Jesus Christ and believe him and walk in that love and say God forgive me and lead me let me grow in you how do we grow the Prophet said reading your Bible and in the pushing out that little button just keeps growing bigger and bigger and bigger and once they do it it's pushing us out it's the one that's going to these doors that's within us the Holy Spirit right goes to them doors to open the door and we got it something there sealed out but like I said now to remember it's not adult reason and all I can I keep saying that called people of time well I hate it believes you can come in adulterer to do anything you want to read Ron says quote sent us in as a Christian you will reap a tubful now that's pretty cool I said I think that's par for easing it right we don't get by with nothing that's the problem we think that way see we're not taught that way we're not taught that God is expecting us to grow he's expecting us to learn to study our Bible well instead of that we'll get on everything in the world we'll get on the Internet's get on all of this that and the other and the Facebook's and the space books and all kind of thing do you get on all of that stuff until we're not studying God's Word we're not praying and believing it what's the problem of it not pushing out it says may they grow in grace and knowledge of the Lord until they've become in the full stature of Jesus Christ then someday be caught up together with him in the clouds to be with the Lord LaRon says when you're born again I listen to them that's what I said you take one statement from and he said it one way you take that and hold that and don't listen you take another statement he says when you're born again he said you get everything you need for the journey you need to have with him he's you get everything you need for the journey when you're born again well what I need statue perfect man no this one I've got it in there we need it out here if you're gonna go that route we need it out here yeah but what's the explaining you get everything you need it's in there waiting on us to take in the word for it to push out it's not it we're so goody-good in it were there's that in the other no it's the fact that we're human beings and we need to be very very what is the honey the prophets say about the Holy Ghost he said he's very timid he said you you've grieving he said he'll go out on a limb when they didn't say he gonna leave he he didn't say you're lost he said just go down on a limb waiting on you call him back right keep pushing out let's see I like this statement but I believe that when you believe on the believe on God with all your heart and accept Jesus as your Savior you've got a portion of the Holy Spirit now the little button becomes a portion that's another way of expressing it he's explaining the Christian life that when we're born again his babies we're born again God gives us all we have Nita is in there in the Holy Spirit we need to keep drinking in until it can push I thought that's the whole thing and how do we do it pray in laying before the Lord serving him believe in him coming to church and leaving and having a good time in God and we're growing in grace and knowledge now brother Brennan said it took him 30 something years before a great statue of a perfect man well how long do you think it's gonna take for us to get it maybe it's gonna take another 50 years well we ain't gonna be around here that long brother Dale well we've been around here a long time already right what do we need to do grow in grace and knowledge there's no way of escaping this is the way to become in the full stature of Jesus Christ what drinking in and letting him push out then if I do have any problems if I do wrong come on I keep saying it because it's in your mind and you you'll run it into the ground and say I'm saying something wrong I'm talking about adultery and stuff like that now don't you get in that junk we're just human beings at how the problem God is there to take care of those problems all we got to do is heal to him and say forgive us forgive me for what I've done Lord forgive me for this thinking that I don't you mean forgive me and the words that I said always like the way brother mote said to me he said you do the best you can now that was his word because we're talking about that the reason he made that statement I remember him preaching but we were talking about it and see he's no way of saying what he's if you still horse take it back right that was his way of saying it said if you steal horse take it back in other words if you repent repent but what are you gonna do the guy that you took the horse from he dies now who are you gonna do well you can give it to the family get the point of what I'm talking about do the best you can right do the best you can with what you got and then God will take care of the rest of it because he knows our heart whether it's sincere or not then told me one time he said you want to worry about it said you can apologize and apologize you say I'm sorry he said that's very cheap he's that's easy words to say I'm sorry sorry supposed to mean what we do right it's not that much we're supposed to turn around and go the other way all right see being a Christian is a Christians life and it's wonderful to be but yet we don't glow in that we have this that the other but it is true that we have an advocate with the father Jesus Christ the righteous we have one to pay our debts but we need to disrepair and say God forgive me the Lord helped me I can't control this that or the other I've got a little problem here with this you know I got a little bit too much internet well just ask God to take care of that there's plenty of good stuff on there I like old westerns and things but you know right down below that you can go and look and right over on the side of there it says real Bible heroes Moses will just click on Moses you can just set there for hours and view Bible stories on your internet what are you following what I'm saying then as it drinks it pushes out limbs it drinks more and pushes out leaves drinks more pushes out blossoms drank more it pushes out oranges just keep eating and let that little button take over in our lives well see we try to figure out well what's the big I big gift the big button a man gave me a book one time he wanted me to put down all that brother branham said about 1977 i throw the book away because i didn't have much time to put into all that go we done taste it well good is it talked about dire when we're here right so you can talk about what that was we're talking about what it is now all right do you understand what I'm trying to say church that's what I've been trying to get is a background or point to where we can see the whole message will tie together and then we can start at faith and see how that goes and how that comes into us how it comes to a place that Christ can live in you and me do the things we do doesn't bother God it's when we don't have the repentant attitude the repentant attitude covers you think brother brown and now we're not Catholic believe in paying for sins before you commit them but one day brother Adam was talking and he said see there he said if your hearts right he said God doesn't forgive you before you ever even ask him cuz he knows what you're going to you said well then I know how fat no wait a minute no um now don't go wrong with me he knows what we will do which he knows we will repent or he knows if we won't repent well then I get by doing it now huh no because a Christian should never have that thought in their mind a Christian should never in their mind even conceive a thought that I can get by with something well God forgive me well you know what don't make him mad for me to ask him to forgive me after he'd done forgive me right I mean that won't you get the point hey don't make him mad at me you don't get mad and say quit repenting no you see the Christian life is a journey that's what I've been trying to preach about we have our problems right here today we've got problems with things our thoughts our minds or things like that that's the problem and we're Christians right oh it would be nice if we could all walk in here and cut out everything and come in here and sit down and be open-minded to God but that that's not exactly the way life is made are you following me see then growing in grace and knowledge is exactly what the Bible says then you grow by eating in the natural so we grow by eating in the spiritual but here's our problem is we'll get to it in a statute of perfect man it's patience sometimes we don't have it we need patience well then there's a lack of patience right God has to put up with the fact that we don't have it he's trying to give it to us and show it how to receive it but we don't have it Oh patience and we grow into this great no patience is coming to a place to where that we can just wait on God I'll get to it when we get into the statue of a perfect man we brought him up reach that 19 and 71 right in the end of 71 72 I asked him I said okay we know we gotta how these virtuous and how do we get him now you can believe you do it you guys know better than me he come back he said I don't let her know you know how to get him we need to virtue how do we get him about 19 and 80 God spoke to my heart about it I believe it was him he said through the opening of the word these virtues will come into being that's what the Prophet had said old time I just had to read it I had to reread the book until it hit to me that's what he has always been telling us that it's through the opening of the word that we get these virtues in time it's through the opening of the word that we get rid of the things in our lives that we find out it wrong the church drinking and push out everything that you have need of is in you at the beginning when you get your new birth right around them I read it to you I've got to there I know he said even the rapture is in you I wish I could get it out that's the problem it's where we don't listen and study the word to that form to try to get an understanding of God's Word a baby grows by eating on Christian grows by eating God's Word you want to push out those things and let that little button grow that's where eating the world of it studying the word praying seeking God those it'll just push out that little button just keeps getting bigger and bigger until it just keeps pushing me out oh no what is that saying is we could just a zero ourselves out you know because the less is involved in me the more God can be well do you have any problems all of us have troubles and that's what I'm trying to tell you that's what I'm trying to get us to see the truth of any time we're born-again Christians right but we have troubles and if we say we have no sin now the Bible says that's wrong for us to say that you said well I'm not a sinner what is sin what is sin but random what is sin it's not drinking gambling smoking run around with men commit adultery no you remember the lady said for heaven's sakes what did seeing this unbelief now listen for just a minute this is the whole message sin is unbelief the things we do is the attributes of unbelief so now let's push that out to this much let's get the adulteries the bad things out and don't worry about that because if we do that we're not a Christian I mean I taught to solve that right up front well it don't bother me brother Dale said I can do anything I want to you can and be lost you can do anything you want to you can live like a devil do what you want to the word or not want to take the big things out of the situation and get down to one little thing what he is unbelief how is it that God could be so great and brotherly and we were talking it yesterday I don't crazy where I think I'm sorry but we were talking about the civil war and I said well brother Larry wouldn't it something that here now I get my min wrong but which one grant over here and Lee over here or something you know the two different generals and here they are and they're both praying for a victory and God is sitting listening to him and God is sitting listening to him and they're both wanting him to answer them right that's why I never have understood why people say they you know would say they will this man and that man's God I certainly don't want no part like that wouldn't it be something you got to thump a coin to decide which one would win in the war you know is that the way God does things well he does it for free I am not totally lost on that I'm just making an illustration I'm just trying to get you to think God sees our lives and knows all about us with you also knows the inward part and that's the main thing he knows what the deep down desires within us is he knows what you really want and he deals according to what you want and the Bible tells you inflame we're not we're not to want things to consume up on her own sales right now let's see that's that's not the way it is but see being a Christian is a different thing we're out here in a kingdoms of domain of Satan literally all of this is Satan from the things we're sitting on the books we're reading out of the paperwork you know I'm talking about all of the whole natural world this is the devil the Christian brother enema is one of those statements are ready where he said that little button coming he said God starts within your soul in other words bringing his kingdom into being in you bringing his kingdom into you in that little button let it grow but brother they'll do you mean no no wait I didn't say that now here's my life statement on the point if you listen to it and listen carefully the more Christian you are the more repentant what is in other words the more you want to be right the older you get in Christ the more you want to be right it's not the older you get you lose the abilities or lose the desires to be right no you should want to where would it be in any point I better run said he said it's impossible to get that Holy Ghost feel woman to put on them fire fans and see women who go right out and still do it and claim to be Christians that should be the one thing we would say well I'm not a question Oh among wrong to state let's see uh when Billy Paul was that man and then this other man came up to him and said ain't you William branham's son something like that why wouldn't he said William Branham wouldn't have a son like that somewhat I'm paraphrasing it you want to have a repentant heart about us on everything or to be more concerned in our lives of everyday then let God come and live more and more because he comes and lives in us he's taking out us right that button it's growing until it takes over there's the statue of a perfect man the man what I want to be right with God it didn't make one I'll be right with mankind you know with each other Laura always want to be right man called me up one time he said I want to talk to you I said okay he said I know what you just said about me yeah and he said I won't apologize he said because he the brother was wrong about what he was saying no not about me but it was wrong about what he was saying and I I corrected him but when I corrected him I said you know that's his right I believe in it and things you know don't condemn him something at that degree and he come back he said your thing but the man I thought would be my enemy was my friend God you see I didn't condemn him you know that's between him and God I was taking up far and he said that's one thing to see that a person would take up for you he said when you was right and I was wrong I said what does it matter who's right and wrong no but I want to be right I want to be right in God I want my attitude to be right in God it don't make no difference better all the rest of it then that's where we should do is a man set to say I'm sorry as easy words the state of God Lord I love you I'm sorry for the way that I've been forgive me don't help me cuz I know I can't win this battle on my own living a Christian life growing in grace and knowledge as we receive God's Word come on musicians as we receive God's Word were growing into that word and that word is growing in us it's changing us it's making us to be what he wants us to be growing in grace and knowledge I stand together think on these things [Music] he has risen from the dead and he is [Music] everybody have a neato [Music] Gavin eat come let's see I hope you understand what I'm trying to break a growth development until we can grow up in him there's a head [Music] then the virtues will be displayed outwardly right because they're inwardly the world sees the world sees us in spirit realm God sees us in the air around [Music] yes he is [Music] risen from the dead every need every tongue confess that Jesus Christ No for me this will crack laws we send it to work Lord it all would be well taken care of we thank you we love you you just make manifest the things that are a spark let your grace and love be sufficient in Jesus not anybody else [Music] [Applause] [Music] father we thank you for today and we just ask you Lord at what we've said would be enough to understand that we try to explain things and we know in human languages if we try to explain anything we'll always mess it up so we just ask you to come on the scene to let us know what a Christian life is there's no perfection in ourselves there's nothing within us that could be anything except one time that we could yield ourselves to you and let you take over and Lord grow in us because growing in grace and knowledge is receiving your word and walking in you and that way it'll be made manifest then back out through us that the world can see Christ and want to live like that and thank you Father we ask you to just be with each one remember the sick ones from on listened touch each one the Lord lead us as we go eat natural meal to be with Wade this afternoon as he ministers your word and just help us all to walk in the light of your grace got us in Jesus now you dismiss every nation every time unconscious the G
