you the problems you know amen and the man said and the women said amen so this thing opened the eyes of my heart as brother matthew watkins comes from beaufort south carolina we'd like to say we hadn't had him in a while and it's really exciting to to be here today and and hear what the lord's got to have for us and then tomorrow same time we'll have service tomorrow in the morning starting

amen god bless you certainly a privilege to be here with you amen and it's been a little while as brother wade said since we were here last but certainly want to uh say it's a privilege count of an honor for uh by the way to invite us appreciate brother sam amen good to see him brother samuel here tonight and and it's been a little while and a lot of water a lot of time has went by a lot of water under the bridge but god has been faithful throughout all of it from the from the past to the present and he'll be faithful tomorrow how will he be faithful how do we know he'll be faithful to us tomorrow because he was faithful yesterday he's faithful today and he's unchanging amen praise the lord well we want to invite you to the word tonight judges chapter 13 this afternoon i should say a little bit in the middle of the day here judges chapter 13 and we'll just take a text here can i move this to the side by the way or just move it just up that's all right all right judges chapter 13 amen we bring greetings from south carolina and uh from my father brother jason watkins pastor there and and uh bring greetings from the church there and i'm just grateful to speak to you to the young people here tonight good to see all of you um that have came i don't know if you're just all from here or maybe different places i know we got to see a lot of the youth here at our youth camp how many was at our youth camp there in south carolina good got a big number of you amen well we certainly had a good time and i just trust that there's still something burning in your heart amen from what the lord has done you've continued to let whatever god did for you grow in your life amen it doesn't mean between then and now that you haven't made any mistakes or you haven't fallen or maybe you feel backwards or you've went the other way amen but you know what the lord jesus is mindful of you tonight he's mindful of each and every single one of your needs and and i believe that today is not just brother wade said you do this every i think every other month and but tonight is not just another every other month service but we're in the presence of the lord and so anything is possible and god knows god knows why you came he knows the motive i don't know i don't even know most of you god knows the motive and the intention of your heart he knows why you're gathered here he knows what thoughts are going through your mind right now and so i just invite you to center your mind and focus your attention on what the lord has and say lord would you come and specifically speak to me amen and to my situation how many could raise a hand and say lord i have a need upon my heart i want you to come and meet that expectation remember louise good to see you there i see you there in the back amen god bless you judges chapter 13 we just want to go straight to the word and let us have something upon my heart praying knowing leading up to this meeting that would come i've just been praying and asked the lord what direction it had me go and i was just in many different directions but the lord has just brought our thoughts to judges and i'd just like to minister this tonight to the youth and to all those that are here and then um and then tomorrow lord willem will just continue in that same amen thought brother bob good to see you also all the ministers and different ones here amen familiar faces i believe that uh i'm thankful for this church thankful for the lighthouse that it's been for many years and the ministries and the teaching gifts and and so i'm not a teacher like brother wade um i'm an evangelist and i've got i've actually got a card in my wallet and i've got a license to prove it and so i brought my evangelistic my evangelist card tonight and so um that's what we're going to do we're going to preach the word amen i believe that there's power in the presence of god and when jesus is near satan will fight you the hardest to keep your attention and focused on the word of god when jesus is the closest satan fights the hardest and so i believe that if what we have to say to you tonight is truth and it can bring freedom then you just push back every spirit say lord drive back any spirit of unbelief or doubt or curiosity or attention whatever it is i have my mind on let me center on what you want to say tonight amen i'd like to speak to you on the value of the spirit the value of the spirit and the children of israel let's just begin reading here at verse uh let's just begin actually reading at verse 3 and judges 13 and the angel of the lord appeared unto the woman and said unto her behold now thou art barren now she was a type of israel israel was quite barren quite backslid in the book of judges we find that there's an entire generation that raises up that doesn't know the lord like their fathers and the god of their fathers and so god the bible says raised up judges to to deliver the people and so she's a type of of the condition of all of israel that she's bearing and there's no fruit coming from her life but he says here in verse three behold now there are buried embarrassed not but thou shalt conceive and bear a son now therefore beware i pray thee and drink not wine nor strong drink and eat not any unclean thing for lo thou shall conceive and bear a son and no razor shall notice this now no razor shall come on his head for the child shall be a nazarite unto god from the womb now that he's not even born yet he's not breathed his first breath but already there's a purpose that that is working in samson's life before he even comes to the world there's already a purpose there's already a plan there's already a blueprint young people there's already before you came here in 2022 and we're here in march and there's a lot happening in your life there's a lot happening locally a lot maybe in your church maybe in the world and the entire grand scheme of things but let me just tell you this don't ever lose sight of the fact that before you were even born god already had a purpose a design for your specific life but just like god had a lot god had a plan satan also has a plan and the purpose for your life and so notice here even before he breathes before he comes god's already said he's going to be a nazarite unto god from the womb and he shall begin to deliver israel out of the hand of the philistines then the woman came and told her husband saying a man of god came unto me as countenance was like the countenance of an angel very terrible means very awesome but i asked him not whence he was neither told me his name and he said behold thou shalt conceive bear a son and she repeats what the angel has said but notice what she says here for the child shall be a nazarite to god from the womb to the day of his death so in other words no matter this is before samson made a wrong choice or the right choice and god said this is this is what i'm going to have a purpose upon the life of this man and no matter where he goes or what he does that purpose will follow him from the first breath unto the last breath now that does not mean that samson will ever fall into the purpose or the will of god for his life he may never yield to that and we find out ultimately his life never really yields the saddest part of samson the saddest part of the story of samson is not a man who we find bound and blind led by a child but the the saddest part of samson's life was that it was a life that god had purposed but he never realized the purpose that god had for him he says here and he shall be unto the day of his death then manoah treated the lord lord let the man of god restored and sin come again and teach us now let's move on just a little bit past this and god hearken unto the voice of manila verse 9 and the angel of god came again to the woman and she sat on the field but manoa her husband was not with her let's just move on to verse 1 of chapter 14. let's just look over so that we can save some time verse 1 of chapter 14 and samson went down to timnath and saw a woman in timnath of the daughters of the israelites oh sorry did i read that wrong young people did i read that wrong he saw let's read it again maybe y'all blinked and you didn't see that or don't don't let me sneak a fast one on you and samson went down to timnath and saw a woman and timnath of the daughters of the israelites no that's not what it says he saw a woman of the daughters of the philistines and he says and he came up and told his father i have seen a woman at tim method of the daughter philistines now therefore get her for me to wife could you imagine talking to your mom that way young man i like her i want it now get it and he says now therefore get her for me to wipe in his father and his mother said is there never a woman among the daughters of thy brethren among all my people that thou goest to take a wife of the uncircumcised philistine and samson said unto his father get her for me for she pleaseth me well this is what's amazing verse four but his father and his mother knew not that it was of the lord it's amazing how sometimes listen to me parents because i know some of you are here it's amazing how sometimes how we view something so black and white and yet god's maybe looking at it in a different way than what you are his father and mother knew not that it was of the lord that he sought an occasion against the philistines for at that time the philistines had dominion over israel let's just bow our heads amen we'll just have a word of prayer lord jesus we just ask for your divine presence lord to come into this building lord we've already read your word so there's already a blessing that's upon our life just from reading it lord but we believe that preaching of the word drives back evil spirits lord and i pray god that right now you'd come and take the promises that you've given us out of your word make them a living reality into every person that's here lord i humble myself now to your spirit lord not coming with any certain agenda any kind of specific thought lord other than just to be a servant to be used now lord i'll speak to these those that are here i don't know many of them lord but i believe that you do believe that you're here in this building tonight and that you've gathered us here for a special purpose lord i may speak things here and lord and if and if it's just me who speaks father maybe if we were to go six or seven weeks down the road maybe all the young people would even struggle to remember what i spoke on or even the scripture i i took lord for that's the that's the shallowness of the word of man lord but if you would come and speak a word tonight and if your voice would speak to the heart of maybe one maybe two of your people lord then it would have an eternal impact it would never leave not even death could take that away from them so we just raise our hands i raise mine with every person here and a sign of surrender and say lord we surrender to your spirit may you come and take your word lord and break the word of life to your family for i believe that's who i'm speaking to tonight bless us now one and all we ask in jesus christ's name amen you can be seated just keep your bible open there to judges book of judges to stay there in chapter 14. preaching to you on the value of the spirit the value of the spirit it's amazing when you look at life and the bible has a way of making it very 3d you can read the psalms of david and you get more than just the just the uh you know uh uh references to doctrinal things but you get a a real life that you can relate to as a as a real person because david lived a life that was very real and it was no pretense and no facade but he spoke of things that you could really relate to and the bible's filled with characters brother branham said you find you a character in the bible and find someone there and identify yourself there in the word because god's not a respecter of persons can you say amen and so so the the the the scripture david speaks of life as a journey and and the bible types it as a journey and and it's and it's amazing because uh you look through through through the entire uh word of god and what you'll find is is that these were lives of men and you can read some of them very detailed from the time they were young and david is as a young man all the way to the age where he's an aged man as a king and he goes off the scene and then you see his entire all the ebbs and flows of david's life and you read the good times and you could look at the bad times and you could look at the times when maybe david was on fire for the lord and then other times when he's backslidden in his life you find the very same exact thing in the life of solomon the the way that his life began his own son and then the way that it ends is just so very different and the bible's filled with this uh type and this picture and this portrait that it's painting of of life let me just speak to you young people here for a minute and say to you that life your entire life is an array of choices that you make and samson's life was led up of many choices and ultimately where we find samson's life at the very end of it and it ends uh you know what the the some of the latter part of his life goes into disgrace we know that at the very end he destroys more philistines in his death than in his life and god was able to get victory out of it his brother adam preaches once more just once more lord and and he preaches that as a type of the church to say just once more lord i let your spirit come and fill my life and but samson's life ultimately when we find him and he's blind and he's bound and he's shaved his head is shaven samson's life was made up of choices it was an array of decisions and choices that he makes and you know choice is such a very important part or aspect of your life the decisions that you make whether they're big and sometimes you're facing things that are large and some major choices of life and but you know then other times you're making decisions and choices just maybe that would seem insignificant or maybe something that was so small or something just like waking up and going out for the day and what you're going to do for the day and where you're going to go and that what things you're going to look at and what things you're going to read him but let me just say this to you young people ultimately every choice both great and small has some measure of impact or consequence for your life and so choices large and small little things maybe things that we listen to or oh and god has given us the ability to make a choice and you choose things in life and you you may be still living at home under the guidance of your mother and your father and and maybe some of the larger decisions they're making for you right now but even in that stage in that season of life you're making choices even if it's just something as simple as what you believe when you hear the word of god and the choice you make of how you view that or how you're going to apply that to your life i don't care what stage you're at and what age you're at in life you're making decisions in your life that will ultimately impact you where you're going to be in the next five years down the road will be determined by the choices that you make very naturally in your life and you know sometimes serving the lord is is we can make it as some great big ethereal thing that you know and maybe even some great grandeus thing like to really serve the lord is to go overseas somewhere and that's wonderful and that's serving the kingdom of god and you know but we sometimes make it so out of touch that at some great it's got to be some great grandeus thing or uh that serving the lord has always got to be in the supernatural place and always living and dwelling in the fear but let me just tell you sometimes serving the lord and being pleasing to the lord is a very simple natural thing that you do every day of your life and sometimes what what it means to us is choices that we make and decisions that we make that can have a profound impact let me just stop for a minute and say you choose the things that you listen to you choose the things that you watch and the things that entertain you and the things you allow into the gates of your soul and and let me just say this you choose the friends that you have you choose those who you choose to associate with and who you choose to allow yourself to come under the influence of now you you have a choice of where you're going to be employed some of you are so i have a choice whether you're going to have continuing education or what school you're going to go to or what job you're going to take or what vocation in life that you'll choose those are ultimately choices and so you pray about those things and you seek the will of god as sons and daughters of god should do and you say lord i want to be led of your spirit i want the choice that you want for my life because ultimately you know what's best lord and i don't and so you make choices and and you know god has given you the the power of choice and every single one of you have a choice today and you're living a life of choices and ultimately where you end up down the road 20 years or 10 years from now maybe you're not there yet and you can't see the vision of that but you can look at your life now and understand where i'm at today is simply a result of choices that i made yesterday and you've been given the ability of choices even brother branham says that you know that god gives you free moral agency and it gives you the the ability to make a choice uh brother branham talks about in the marriage of the lamb and he says now god couldn't just push you through some kind of a pipe he said if god was to do that there'd be no victory in that there would be no faith in that but he says ultimately to overcome you've got to make a decision you've got to make a choice god isn't going to force you he's not going to press you you're not just going to magically be an unbeliever one day and then a believer by osmosis the other day no it's got to be a choice that you make that transcends your dad and your mom and the church you're in or the family you've been raised in but it comes down to you as an individual to make a choice to say i'm going to choose to live my life for the lord jesus and so in the large grand picture what you see is is that choices both great and small are you what you notice after a while of choices is you can notice what maybe we would call a pattern and you can look at the pattern of someone's life and you notice sort of a certain pattern of choices and they're sort of go you start to notice that through those little small choices you see a pattern and then after you sort of zoom out of the pattern you sort of see a trajectory of a life you can see which way it's going you can see is it going towards the word of the lord is it is it is my life a reflection of of the word of god or is it a reflection of the world ultimately really the mirror of god's word is the only thing that can tell you that and so you notice choices then lead to decisions decisions that lead to habits habits then builds character and as brother brandon preaches in leadership and ultimately that character determines your destiny and where you end up in life you notice a certain ebb and flow a certain trajectory that a life sort of takes and you watch it sort of go a certain way like brother branham said that bullet with those sights if it's just a little bit on the off right here at the at the muzzle he said it may just be a hair off he said but way down range it's going to be feet two or three feet off the target but it started with just your life just becoming unaligned with god's channel and god's purpose for your life you hear young people you're here and hearing me today it's what the lord just laid upon my heart and i believe it's for you you've got to believe that though too and so you ultimately arrive what you notice here is that you can look at your life now and you can understand that you have r you have arrived where you're at 18 19 17 16 13 no matter where you're at in life 30 you've ultimately arrived where you're at because of small choices that you made and so even samson's life is a life that's made up of choices and decisions and this is why we we preach so much on this about your your the decision and the choice that you make we we we speak a lot about the things that you ought to to do things you shouldn't watch places you shouldn't go things you shouldn't listen to because ultimately those are influences and those things are made to influence your choices and so you look at this and even samson's life starts out this way as the bible said god anoints his life his life begins here uh in judges chapter 13 as we read it when his mother is visited by this angel and so samson learns this as the bible said if you could put that first slide up on the on the screen on the overhead that i sent the powerpoint did you get that brother you can display that not sure um how they're doing that but that's all right if we didn't uh didn't get it it's just fine did we give me a thumbs up did we get that powerpoint uh or not where we can display it no we didn't so you didn't get it through email that's all right um so notice here i i'm gonna i'm gonna try yeah it looks like i got it uh maybe you can bring a note brother with uh with the right email or where to send that to because it's all right i want to get it up on the screen just felt the lord gave me that so that's okay we'll we'll get it sometimes technology uh fights but uh we'll get the victory you believe that amen you can just enter right there brother louise okay okay uh yeah i don't i don't even know if i think i might may have maybe i can just email it by the louise so we can have it yeah what's the you want to type the email send it send it away i'll attach it once you type it you know the bible says there will be no liars in heaven well there also be no wires in heaven good so i'm just going to put powerpoint here i'll attach this okay okay yeah if you guys just display it there in the back i just sent it to the email so if you don't get it blame brother louise [Laughter] okay okay perfect thank you bro thank you nope that's usbc that's all right i want you to notice this here because it's it's this photo that i had the lord just gave me um okay we're still gonna try that's all right i think that's lightning brother nope nope that's mini display that's all right that's okay i want you to notice this here because i i displayed this and i just emailed it there if they get it if we get it up good don't worry we don't have to have we don't absolutely have to have it so it's fine don't don't struggle but you notice god anoints samson's life even from birth as we read this angel visits manoa and the bible says that god begins to speak of the purpose of this life and he says he's going to be a nazirite unto god and he's going to begin to deliver israel out of the hand of their oppressors and so samson's life is anointed we can say that and we hear this term a lot to be anointed uh with the spirit of god and so we know that samson wasn't filled with the holy ghost as you and i are filled uh by the baptism of the holy ghost in a new birth it wasn't couldn't be a new creature uh because the spirit of god had it been sent yet but i just want you to focus here for a moment he wasn't filled in the in the sense that we are but what's amazing is that samson's life is anointed from the day he breathes his first breath there's already an anointing which means a purpose or a plan that god has for his life uh you notice here this this uh this this word and it's even the word that we use for you read this in the bible and you read that uh you read this about samson you also read this about john uh the the the uh john the baptist that he was filled with the holy ghost from his mother's womb it's very much the same exact way that samson was filled with the holy ghost you read in psalms 55 51 where david begins to pray and he says lord take not your holy spirit from me uh don't do he says cast me not away and take not your holy spirit though we know david didn't have the indwelling of the holy ghost but what this was i'm preaching on the value of the spirit this was the spirit of god that was anointing david as a man now this word here for spirit stay with me young people i told you i wasn't going to teach but i just want to bring you bring you something so that you have it uh samson's life is anointed and and and this word uh for spirit is actually the hebrew word ruach thank you brother jcanada gmail.com all right let me get this to you brother amen so we have this i want you all to see this so let me just send it again here it goes amen three strikes were out so we're gonna stop after this okay good praise the lord so we notice this here that this this samson's life is enabled it's anointed from birth god has a purpose he has a plan for his life and so god is going to fill samson with the spirit of god or he's going to fill samson with the breath of god he's going to fill samson with the purpose of god and the bible says he shall deliver begin to deliver israel out of the hands of the philistines so we know that they were under the oppression of the philistines because of their backsliding god actually raised up the philistines to afflict israel and so god would use enemy nations and he would raise up in enemy nations he takes pharaoh and he actually calls him my servant and it wasn't that pharaoh was a servant of the lord but pharaoh was going to be used for the purposes of god uh we can even see brother branham saying putin uh he speaks of russia and he says gotta raise up a wicked nation and he'll use that as a servant one day to judge this nation and so so so so the philistines are used as a tool of judgment upon israel but now israel god is going to raise up a savior because that's what the word judge me now not in the sense of savior like jesus is savior but the word why do we say jesus is my savior because the word savior means deliverer when we say jesus saves what are we saying when someone says in the baptist church they've almost made this a cliche i'm saved are you saved what does it mean to be saved well saved means to be delivered it means i've been delivered from something so samson would deliver them deborah would deliver them barrack would deliver them they would begin to save or deliver the people from their oppressor when we say jesus saved me what do we say him he delivered me from sin and one day i'll really be saved one day i'll be delivered out of this body in this flesh and this world and then i can truly say i'm saved hallelujah and so notice this here if you can just advance to the next slide and go through this just an image the lord gave me and i wanted you just to fix your mind uh on that just for a minute young people if you could look at that as you see this picture of this young man and he's he's making a choice in his life he's got a direction that he's going to go and he can either go left or he can go right we can see just by the image if you can see that that one way is a bright way one way there's light one way there's there's there's a there's a life one way and one way there's the right choice and in the other way there's the wrong choice and there's darkness and there's no brightness there and so he's standing there at the valley of decision trying to make a choice samson's life was made up this way we know that his life was one if you can just advance to the next slide that'd be great uh listen to what listen to what d.l moody says here this is powerful he says you might as well try to hear without ears or breathe without lungs as tried to live a christian life without the spirit of god in your heart powerful you might as well try to breathe without lungs or try to hear without ears as to try and attempt to live a christian life without the spirit of god so notice what samson is filled with as we just go through this and even in genesis 1 2 and it says then the earth was without form and void and and darkness was upon the face of the deep and the spirit of god can you say that with me young people can you say the spirit the spirit so this is the the word ruach i'm gonna go to the next slide here and if you can see this it says it's the it's the word that he's using for the spirit of god which if you see the definition is the breath or the wind the spirit of god this is what it would mean in genesis when he said and the spirit of god moved upon the face of the waters it was the breath of god it was the wind of god this is what it means in genesis 6 when he says and behold i even i do bring a flood of waters upon the earth to destroy all flesh wherein is the breath of life it's the spirit of life it's the ruach of god it was the spirit of god it was the enabling force it's what made samson different are you here it's what separated him this is all that made sampson different he wasn't special in and of himself outside of the anointing or the purpose that god placed upon his life that was the only thing that made samson different from anybody else that's the only thing that made shadrach meshach and abednego come out of the fiery furnace alive and not burn like the rest of the soldiers it's the only thing that visited that allowed daniel to come out of the lion's den alive it's what anointed samson to be able to lift a gate that weighed 2 000 pounds and carry it 30 miles through the city it wasn't that samson was some atlas world man and muscle bound and bodybuilder and he just had all kinds of muscles popping out of his chest no brother branham said he was actually a little scrawny shrimp that's what we used to call people in school we'd want to really be condescending you little shrimp what are you gonna do a little scrawny shrimp you ain't nothing you know brother branham says that's what samson was you see you mean samson wasn't this big old muscle bound just strong no if he was then why would i look at him and say please tell me where in the world do you get your strength from he was a paradox it was a miracle wasn't laying in his body it wasn't in his natural figure it wasn't in his own human ability what made samson different was the breath of god and the spirit of god that anointed his life notice here just go through this in genesis chapter 8 god remembered noah and every living thing and all the cattle was with him in the ark god made a wind this was the ruach this was the breath of god he made a wind to pass over the earth and the waters assuaged numbers 27 let the lord the god of the spirits the ruach the breath said a man over the congregation job says as long as i have life within me the breath the ruach of god in my nostrils the spirit of god has made me the breath of the almighty gives me life and isaiah and the spirit of the lord shall rest upon him the spirit of wisdom this is a prophecy of messiah the spirit of wisdom and understanding the spirit of counsel and might a spirit of knowledge and of the fear of the lord jesus in matthew 3 when he was baptized went straight away out of the water and lo the heavens were open unto him and he saw the spirit of god the ruach the breath the enabler he's seen the spirit of god dwelling descending like a dove and lighting upon him and so we know this the bible speaks of these throughout the entire old testament you find people regular human people that were not any different than any other people in the earth except that god breathed upon them amen so his power this was the enabling force this is what david was so fearful to lose to say don't let your spirit depart from me don't take that anointing that david valued i'm preaching on valuing the spirit david had a value for the spirit of god in his life and so much that he would pray that prayer don't take it from me lord so what what was the spirit of god to do it was to make them what they could not otherwise be i want to take that image of samson out of your mind as some muscle man brother ham says just a curly headed shrimp he had no ability in his own self but when the spirit of the lord came upon him mightily samson was able to slay thousands of philistines with the jawbone of a donkey how brother matt how did samson overcome how could how did he have this ability was he some kind of special superman or some superhero no he was just a normal david was just so normal and so ordinary that his own father seen no value in his life he was so ordinary and so plain maybe so weak and just looked like so simple that his own father couldn't see the value but god looked beyond the simplicity of his flesh and his humanity and god seen a heart that he could anoint with his life and when man see nothing but a shrimp and man see nothing but a simple man god seen a conqueror why was david any different no it was that the spirit of god could come upon the flesh of david and david could have faith to say this philistine i'll cut his head off today it was the enabling power to be what they couldn't otherwise have been and to say what they couldn't have said god gave samson the power to kill a lion uh to carry a city gate 20 miles away thousands of pounds you say brother matt when could sampson do that only when the spirit of god dwelled upon him even the spirit of prophecy in the man a man like ezekiel son of man prophesy speaking of these bones he would say he would eat god what would god do when he took jeremiah a man a normal man when he would take men like amos normal men but god would literally take his spirit or his anointing and he would baptize thy human vessel with his life what was the purpose for fireworks for show so that everyone could applaud no it was so that that man could be used as a tool or an instrument for the purpose of god so why would god anoint samson's life to deliver his people the old testament's filled with this with men that could speak through their mouth words that they otherwise couldn't speak because it wasn't their words when you rejected god jeremiah you weren't rejecting jeremiah because it wasn't his words you were rejecting jehovah when you hear the words of a prophet that god would anoint it wasn't the words of a kentucky hillbilly it was the mind of christ so when you reject the prophet you're not rejecting a man from kentucky you're rejecting almighty god and so the old testament the bible ends with these powerful characters but it ends with a promise it's left with two simple promises two about the spirit and this power that enabled this ruach this breath and he would breathe upon samson he'd breathe his life as the bible says adam even even the first man as the bible says he but yet he had no life so god breathed into his nostrils the breath of life and then adam became a living soul job says this the breath of god the very wind of god the spirit of god enables me to live outside of that he's no different than any other man outside of that he's just like any other person say brother matt why is that even important why are you partnering preaching on that because i'm trying to get you to understand young people the miracle of samson was not samson the miracle of samson's strength was never about samson let me just tell you today you'll never overcome because you are like any other person you can look in the mirror and say i'm just like any other person it's never about you it was never about you it never will be about you it's about the spirit of god that can come into a vessel of your life and you'll conquer the devil when you otherwise couldn't you'll give victory over the enemy in your body when you've failed many times and you've tried many times and say i just can't overcome it but when the spirit of god enters your life remember brother branham speaks about his own nephew and he's talking about the boy that he's got a temper and he talks about the mother and the father and he's this boy is going to marry this girl and he's just so rude and he can't say i'm sorry and brother brandon begins to talk to the man and he says look at you or he talks to the woman says you're german and your people they just stare at you they don't say anything they don't speak to you and he looks at the woman he says but you're not that way your entire family's that way meaning a morning i'd come to his this woman's sister and the prophet says i look at her and say sure fine morning ma'am isn't it he said she'd just stare at me brother man said i'd say to her you ought to come see us ought to come see us someday brother adam said she'd just look right at me and stare at me just german real stoic independent and he says all of them's that way except that one sister except that one woman in the entire family and brother adam says look at you and and hear the family is trying to diagnose what's wrong with my son and and and brother brandon says look at your life he says he says but you're not that way and he's then he points to the father of the boy and he says look at your family they're all fighters and drunks now it's brother branham's own family it doesn't tell they don't date but it's his own nephew he's speaking to and he says look at all of them he said they're fighters they're drunks they're alcoholics and he says they they he says that's that's what they are they're brawlers and he looks into the man and he says but you out of your entire family he says but yet you're not that way and brother man says now what did that to you and he points to the mom and he says what made you different from the rest of your sisters he points to the dad what made you different he said that's the spirit of christ down inside of you and he says see when you get the indwelling of the spirit of god i love how the prophet says this he says when you get the holy ghost it's no longer your people anymore it's your christ living down inside of you you're not subject to your family anymore you're subject to a new name and a new family so the bible would come and sampson was no different than anybody else except the spirit of god he was no different than anybody else and you find that out when the spirit of god leaves him and then he's bound and then they poke out his eyes what happens the spirit of the lord departs from samson's life and he's no different than anybody so you tell me brother matt what happens when you take the spirit of god out of our churches when you remove the spirit of the lord and you turn the message and you turn preaching and you just turn it into a dress code and you turn it into a book of rules and all you do is what you don't do and i don't do this and i don't do that and i don't do this and i don't go here and we don't do this and we don't cut our hair and we don't when you make it just about mechanics and what you're doing and you remove the spirit of god you're no different than any other church you're no different than anybody else but when you value the spirit of god which is the enabler of the word of god and jesus the bible tells us there would be a promise left that there would come a man not like samson who came upon the spirit of god would come upon and they can leave but there would come a man that was so full of the breath of god he was so anointed with the spirit of god that same wind that breathed upon david and he would say don't let your spirit depart from the same wind that breathed upon samson there would come a man and the old testament prophesies in isaiah that the spirit of wisdom and the spirit of knowledge and the spirit of understanding would rest upon him what was jesus he was fully anointed he was all that samson was he was all that david was he was all that abraham was he was all that moses was in one single human vessel he had all of the gifts of the spirit he would have all of the fruits of the spirit he would have all of the abilities he would have the power of creation in his in his mouth the bible says it this way he would have the breath of god without measure without limits oh that's so wonderful brother matt look at jesus and look at this limitless powerful but you know what there was a second promise that after that the spirit of the lord would be poured out upon all flesh so that one man from one man upon whom all the spirit of god dwelled there would come many men and many women who all had different abilities and gifts but the same not the same breath the bible says that the same power that raised jesus from the dead dwells inside of you what is it brother man it's the enabling force it's the enabling power that was upon samson's life to make him what god intended for him to be now what god intended and what the devil intended was two very different things god had a course he had a path he had a direction that he could go if you could just display that powerpoint that image again he had a direction he could go samson's life was presented with this choice an anointing you know it's a powerful thing when god anoints a life it's a powerful thing when the spirit of god takes control of a son of god or a daughter of god as brother branham says oh the greatest problem down throughout history for god is to find somebody who he could get under his complete control the great problem all down through the history of the church prophet of god repeats it six or seven times is to find one vessel someone who will totally sell out someone who will totally give of themselves someone who will completely surrender mind body spirit and soul and when god can find a vessel a true son or daughter of god who he could pour out his life he could pour out his anointing they could be so emptied out and freed out and emptied and cleaned out every channel in their spirit that's when god can use your life when you've poured out and you've emptied out all of yourself how many could say lord let me empty out myself let me empty out clean out the channels of my mind so that your purpose and your spirit and your anointing oh if god could get one man brother adam says a vegan just get one man under his complete control that's all he needs prophet of god says as one man one woman i'm gonna speak to the men here just for a moment it's just what the lord told me to do so so you brothers just listen real close because this is what the lord inspired me to say i'm going to speak to everybody but just for a moment if he could get one man with a purpose you see man is god's key to his kingdom man men man i'm not talking about what the world defines as a man they've lost the meaning of manhood brother branham even speaks about that in his age he said it almost can't tell them apart he said they there's really no men that burliness men are so soft now and he says you almost can't tell a man apart from from from anything else and boy if it was that way then my goodness how is it today you see a man was god's purpose even in the beginning i want you to young people keep the screen there if you have your bible even if you have to use your phone i'm going to give you permission to do that look up genesis chapter 1. i want you to look at this because i want you to read it with me especially you men if you don't have a bible or a phone with a you could use a bible then use your neighbors there i want you to read this together i believe this is just directly from the lord notice this in genesis chapter 1 verse 26 i'm just hearing the rustling of the leaves so i'll just give it just a moment for you to find your your spot genesis chapter one and i want you to read verse 26 with me you gotta say amen young people all right well wait they didn't say amen you got to say amen young people amen verse 26 and god said notice let us make man in our image after our likeness and let them have dominion that's an important word let us make man in our image and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air and over the cattle and over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth so god created man in his own image in the image of god created he him male and female created he them god blessed them and said unto them be fruitful multiply and replenish the earth and notice this word and subdue it take control of it because what you don't take control of men in your life will become out of control but you were created to take dominion you were created to subdue he says i have dominion over the fish of the sea the fowl of the earth and every living thing that moveth upon the earth so man is the key even god starts the home the family the marriage everything starts with men finding their proper anointing in their life say brother about my anointing yes your life as a son of god has to be anointed for a purpose say is there something i'm going to feel i'm going to shake no no i'm not talking about that type of anointing here i'm talking about the design or the blueprint that before you were ever born or came onto this earth god drew up the plans then he had him engineered then he stamped him with his own approval and said i've got a purpose i've got a plan i've already got i've already charted your course long before you were on this earth god already wrote out your entire story but it will be up to you to subdue and have dominion and find your place as a son of god and let me just say until you do it'll never work if you're a seed of god and you've got the you've gotta you if god has predestinated you and you've got a seed gene of god down inside your life you can run and you can run but it will never work because man is the key from the very beginning a man under the influence not of drugs not the influence of worldly things not the influence of sports or video games you weren't born to play video games that's not your purpose your purpose isn't known and and your purpose isn't found in some twitch uh a career or some streaming career that's not your purpose that's a perversion of the devil trying to take god's plan ball it up and throw it out and give you his except for the man are you preaching against video games no you can take anything in your life and maybe it's harmless and it's okay for you to do recreation whether it's sports whether it's a career no matter what it is and if satan could do anything he'll take that thing that is harmless and unsinful and he'll so inundate you and wrap you up and bind you with the spirit that's upon it to where something that maybe wasn't sinful now is a man under the influence of the holy ghost when i say influence i mean he's under the control of the mind of god a man under the control of the holy ghost he's sowed out he's consecrated like samson he's a nazirite he speaks of the head of consecration he's consecrated to the purpose that god has placed in his life and let me just tell you today when there's a man who's a seed of god who has sold out his life to the purpose of god and he's let not saying he's perfect i'm not saying he doesn't make mistakes but he's single-minded to say though none go with me still i'll follow i've got a purpose i've got a direction and it's the word of god in my life when god can get a man like that he is god's greatest weapon he will tear down the kingdom of devils he will tear down purposes of satan and demonic spirits and influences you say brother matt why aren't you preaching on the on the women let me tell you what brother branham says you be a son of god and she'll be a daughter of god she was created to be that if a man will just find his proper place you want to take a home that's going the wrong way and children are going the wrong way and it looks like the trajectory is going the wrong way how do you save that home brother matt let a son of god repent and get under the control of the holy spirit and you'll watch a home that quickly gets in line but watch a man get out of his place and get distracted and tangled up and entangled in the wrong things and his mind isn't single and he's a church but he's really not and he's there but he's really not and he's got a career and maybe a job and he's so focused on what the on what the devil wants him to focus on and he's missed the anointing god has in his life you'll watch a family begin to crumble because man is not on the top i'm not talking about a chauvinist man is the foundation of the home where is the foundation of the home it's on the bottom created this this picture in people's minds that man is the head of the house and we create the head because the head is up here and we say the man lord's over he's over no that's a perversion the first man the true man was the foundation the house was built upon and when a man is in his proper place under his anointing how god has made him young men when you can find the the purpose and consecrate your life to that purpose god can use you as one of his greatest tools in his toolboxes he could take one man who's dedicated and sold out to the purpose of god and he could take an entire maybe an entire youth group and a dynamic that's existing in that youth group to pull them the wrong way let one son of god get the baptism of the holy ghost in his heart and come into his proper position and he'll tear the devil's kingdom down in a church oh i want to say lord use me could you say that young people just feel the anointing of the holy ghost maybe for one man they could raise a hand and say lord use my life i want to be consecrated to your purpose oh lord he's god's greatest weapon you know who you know the problem though is that there's another being who knows that a man under the inspiration of the anointing and control of the holy ghost is god's greatest weapon the devil knows that also man is god's foundation so if you break the man you break the foundation and what happens when you break the foundation the rest of the home collapses he's the foundation that creates and carries the rest of the house even when god creates man it's a reflection of himself when he creates the home it's a reflection of his own dominion his own dwelling even when he creates that the the his position is calling he says subdue it have dominion over it you're to be an administrator a steward over the gift that god has placed in your life remember brother branham says i would have served him years ago even in my teenage years he said i would have came to the lord sooner but a spirit hung over me preventing me from doing that so let me just say this to you young people samson was anointed with a purpose before he was ever born and though samson never surrendered fully to that purpose it was with him the entire time it never left him and the purpose of god abides with your life even if a spirit's hanging over you today to get you to repel the word of god and not fully surrender to the word of god make no mistake god's purpose is still there all the time this is why paul said in galatians 5 i say then walk in the spirit what's he saying walk in your anointing walk in the spirit of god and you shall not fulfill the lusts of the flesh for the flesh lusteth against the spirit and the spirit against the flesh these are contrary one to the other so what happens god says i'm going to create man look in genesis chapter two if you have it there just pull it up keep that before before us but i want you to use your bible or your phone there thus saith the heavens and the earth this is genesis chapter 2. i'm going to read this is going to maybe differ just slightly from the new king james but let me just read it you read along with me verse 1 thus the heavens and the earth and all the host of them were finished on the seventh day god in his word verse 4 this is the history of the heavens and the earth when they were created in the day the lord god made the earth and the heavens before any plan of the field was in the earth let me just let me move past some of this in genesis chapter 2 look at verse 15 then the lord god took the man and put him then the lord god took the man who he created just like he created the fish just like you created the birds he creates man in his own image and god takes the man and god places the man in the garden of eden when god puts you somewhere it's where you're supposed to be and when you come out of and you leave where god placed you it'll never work i'm going to keep saying that you can try and you could push and you could toil and you can sweat but when you're outside of where god placed you it won't work so he puts him in the garden of eden to tend and keep it so what was eden you say brother man it was just garden don't think of a garden eden was a condition eden was an atmosphere eden was an ecosystem it was a dwelling place it's where god placed man it's how god created him you see before god ever created the fish he created the atmosphere or the ecosphere for that fish to live in and if the fish lives in the place god made him to live the fish can live but when you take that fish out of the place god was made for it god made for him to live what happens to the fish when you bring him into your environment he's not created for it so his gills maybe for a little while can breathe and you can see him breathe after you catch that fish and he's breathing and he's breathing and think oh he's fine he's just gonna do good no he can't because he wasn't made for that atmosphere he wasn't made for it maybe temporarily he can live in it but after a while if he's not made for the atmosphere that he's in he'll die so eden the pro was what it housed the presence of the spirit of god and how's the spirit of the lord that's where the spirit of god came and the cool of the evening what was the spirit of god it was the breath of god how does man how is adam going to live how is he going to function like god made him to function as long as adam lives to the laws that were created for him adam can continue to function how god made him and so what is what is the law that god made the spirit of the lord was adam's lifeline the spirit of god that would visit adam and eve in the call of the evening no hallelujah you see every time god creates created something he first created the atmosphere for that something to live in before he made the fish as we said he made the water the water was created for the fish hello before he made plants what did he create young people before he ever made the first beautiful flower that you can go and you could smell and you could enjoy and oh it's so girls love it so much and you get a girl flowers and all oh just so beautiful and they just love them i i just have never i like think flowers are pretty but boy don't ever give me flowers for my birthday i mean i'll try to act like i like them try to act like i'm happy try to put on a show but a girl she doesn't have to she just oh she smells that aroma it just melts her heart before you ever smelled that beautiful flower and you enjoyed its beauty before god ever created the flower he created the soil and without the soil the flower's not beautiful before what was it the soil was created for the plant not vice versa oh before god created the stars what did he make the firmament what was the purpose of the firmament it was so that a star could be a star as long as the star dwelled in the firmament it could shine like the stars as long as the planet as long as the flower i hope so bad you're catching me young people as long as the flower stayed in the soil it could be a beautiful perv it could fulfill the purpose of god for its life but what happens when you take that flower and you pull it out of the soil you might put it in a pretty little clear vase and pour water in there and you put it in front of your window for some sunlight and you try and you try and you water it and you water it you give it enough sun how many sisters can testify just after a while suddenly that flower will start to lower its leaves then little petals will fall off it'll eventually die you know why because though you try to make it live in an atmosphere it wasn't created for it can never live you might love that you you might take it and take it out of the ground and oh i could just admire it and it's but god created the soil because he he he creates the atmosphere because in a hope so bad you see this it's the atmosphere or the condition or the soil that allows it to function how it was created to function but when you remove the fish from the water it can no longer function as it was created to function the fish has to have the water the plant has to have the soil what happens to the star when you take it out of the firmament it becomes a falling star and something that was meant for you to get you get get uh you can sit there and gaze at it and enjoy it now becomes destructive and just like the fish needs the water you need the spirit of god because man was created for the spirit of god to dwell inside into tabernacle you take a fish out of the water he dies you take a flower out of the ground it dies it withers you take a star it becomes a falling star a meteor and it actually destroys itself begins to break up and when you take a man who is created to be subjected to the holy spirit and under the control of the anointing of god in his life and when you remove him out of that purpose and out of that spirit he destroys himself and a man who was created to be the greatest weapon becomes the greatest tool for the devil he watched men and and who who lived outside of the condition that god created for them take up son of god remove him from the presence of god put something in his life that bega he begins to lust after and begins to chase after that man that was created to be a healer will become a destroyer he'll destroy children he'll destroy wives he'll destroy the atmosphere of the home he'll self-destruct right why brother matt because he wasn't made to live there and let me just stop here for a moment young people there are people in this world the bible calls them the children of disobedience the children of darkness and another place it calls them and this is satan's eden and there's certain conditions there are certain things that water satan's eden there's certain things that give it light and give it life and there's certain people who can live in satan's eden and they can feed on satan's eat him and they can drink from satan's eaten and they'll be just fine but if you're a son of god you may try to fit in you may try to force yourself through but you'll never fit in this eden because you weren't created for it you'll always be out of place you'll always be an oddball because you weren't created for satan's eden and it will never work i'm trying and you can try all you want and try to look cool and try to fit in with that crowd at school and try to fit in and do the right things and try to say the right things but listen you'll never fit it'll never work you say brother matt what'll happen if you don't yield and surrender through the presence of god you'll destroy yourself just like samson destroyed himself because he tried to live in an atmosphere he was never created to live in are you here can we go just a little bit further samson's anointed from birth very special the bible says he'll begin to deliver israel it was something he was born with something that would enable as we set his life but what happens he said for the man it's so beautiful god uses him he's born under a nazarite vow god uses him to defeat the enemy you can read the victories of samson the thousands of philistines he he kills you could read when the spirit of god came upon him mightily and powerful things took place in samson's life now god visits manoa and tells him you're barren i'm going to deliver you through your bareness you'll conceive and tells her don't drink anything strong don't eat any unclean thing because this deliver is going to be built with a purpose in other words in other words god is telling his mother and his father i've drawn the blueprints up for samson i've already i've already constructed them and as an architect will go through and he starts he's not aimlessly an architect doesn't just start and sort of meander and just you know i think maybe i'll put this here now no he's already got a vision before he takes his pin and starts drawing he's already got something in his mind and then he begins to draw those prints then he engineers them to make sure they're going to stand and make sure they're going to stand up to the tests and the trials and the storms and the difficulties that it'll face and long before god gone before the builder ever takes the first piece of wood and the first nail and hammers it there's already been an architect who's already designed it there's already been an engineer that says if you build it according to the prince if you build it according to how i've engineered it it'll withstand every storm and it will withstand every wind it'll withstand everything that the devil wants to throw its way because i've already engineered its life and listen to me family of god are you there in this church here tonight long before your trial or your test or your wind or your storm ever came god already engineered you to be able to stand in the day of eve in the evil day he already anointed your life that means there's nothing the devil can throw at you to knock you out but god's already anointed samson's life i've already drawn it in fact i've already charted his course samson's life it's already charted i've already written the story got a plan a call and an anointing i've seen it from the beginning you say brother matt does god really call my life that way jeremiah some of your favorite scriptures in chapter 29 verse 11 i know the plans thou has for me jeremiah begins to say the lord speaking and says i know the plans i know the thoughts i know the thoughts that i think towards you saith the lord thoughts of peace not of evil to give you an expected end what is god saying in this verse of jeremiah your end is already determined god's already thought david says you've numbered my days you know the beginning you know the middle you know the end you know the teenage years you know the adolescent years you know my first my whatever i'm gonna face lord you've already drawn them out you've already charted them you've already given it away you've already engineered them you've already planned them the bible said he's planned the life of every individual he's given the life your life has specific instructions and if you don't obey the instructions it'll never work so what we find is here that every life has a purpose even pharaoh the bible says was raised up and born into the world for a purpose can you say amen tonight even judas was born in the earth with a certain specific calling and anointing and plan and instructions in his life even pharaoh was given judas was given oh but let me remind the devil god also specifically designed my life god also raised me up for a purpose and it's not to be a pharaoh and it's not to be a judas you've got to believe that young person i was not made and born into this world to be a judas but i was born to cut the devil's head off i was raised up in this ladies in church age to destroy the kingdom of satan i've got a purpose in this age see oh that's so wonderful brother matt such good preaching oh my god's already planned it he's already instructed it he's already blueprints there's already an architect an engineer he's already charted my course how wonderful now let me just put my life on cruise control it don't work that way you see because in the middle of all of god's planning for samson's life there was one thing called free moral agency and samson was a man who was also made up of memory conscience reasoning imagination affection all the gates of his spirit and the gates of his eyes and the gates of his mouth god had all this purpose and all this plan and all of this planning and all this forethought but you see the cost of the choice something may be so small that has big consequences samson saw a woman of timnath of the daughter of the philistines why why samson god didn't choose your wife to be a philistine let me just say this young people your soul mate does not wait in some church down the road that doesn't believe what you believe your soulmate does not way to some unconverted person that you're going to lead to the message and lead to the truth your your your soul mate who god has for you does not live outside of this message but god has ordained you let me just stop here for a minute because i believe the holy spirit's telling me to say this so i'm just going to say it god has ordained a specific path and a plan but you have a choice to either take that way or take another one and destroy your life and she doesn't live he doesn't live oh i'm just gonna i'll just lead them to the lord i need i love how brother burly williams i think it was brother burley who said it if you can get them in with a hot dog someone will get them out with a hamburger you might be able to persuade them in but if they're not rev if it's not revealed to them and they're not born into it it might go 10 years might go 20 might go 30 but eventually that kingdom will come down it's the cost of a choice he's taking a nazarite vow stay away from dead things samson was a nazarite john the baptist was a nazarite jesus was a nazarite but even with that nazarite vow that samson takes he makes the wrong choice the wrong choice his mother and his father say samson is there not a daughter of her own people that you've got to go into the philistines you know what was the mom what was the dad you know the problem with sampson he looks at it and says you know what that's just mom what samson failed to see is that it wasn't just mom it wasn't just dad but actually manoa was a vessel of mercy that god had in samson's life and that vessel of mercy was there to stop samson and god has placed vessels of mercy in your life young people listen to me sisters brothers god has placed vessels of mercy and if you're not careful you'll do like sampson and you'll say oh that's just mom oh that's just dad of course of course dad's gonna say that of course what did i expect mom of course samson didn't realize it wasn't just mom it wasn't just dad it was a vessel of mercy that god anointed in his life to get him to turn around and go the other way it was a warning sign you know warning signs when you drive and you see a flashing yellow light and you gotta bear a barricade and it says road closed road closed flashing do not enter how many people would get in their car and then the road to the left is open but the road to the right says road closed do not enter and you just go right through the barricade and just bust over sandbags and there goes barrels flying you go through that barricade and it's flashing turn around do not enter wrong way how many people would get in their car and just bust over barricade and bust over barricade and bust over barricade you say brother man i would never do that but how many times in your life does god put mothers and fathers and pastors and people and friends who try to tell you and encourage you and you break right over the prayers of a mother and right over the encouragement of a pastor even of a sermon and god puts what are those those are warning signs those are flashing lights that say turn around go the other way that thing that you have in your life is destroying you it's eating away your mind it's taken turn around do not enter go the other way samson just keeps going [Applause] right through the next one right to the next one just going to keep going don't matter this is mom that's just dad how i was raised and and you know eventually it ends eventually it ends judges chapter 16 turn there as we close i know i've been a little lengthy but just give me just a minute we'll close notice what it says here in verse 4 and came to pass afterward verse 6 chapter 16 that he loved a woman in the valley of sorak whose name was delilah and the lord of philistines came up unto her and said unto her he enticed him see where in his great strength life by what means we may prevail against him that we may bind him this is the devil's purpose no matter what he brings into your life he has one single purpose to wrap you up and bind you wrap you and wrap you and wrap you and get you deeper and deeper deeper to where you're you're in his web to bind you to afflict him delilah said in verse six tell me i pray where does your great strength lie where is wherever thou mightest be bound to afflict thee samson said on earth they bind me with seven green with that were never dried and then shall be weak and be as another man a lord of philistines brought them up seven green wits which has not been dried she bound him with him now and her men lying in weight abiding in the chamber and she said unto him the philistines be upon thee samson you notice that in verse nine there were men lying in weight there were men lying in weight and then samson is laying asleep and there's men waiting to pounce he doesn't know has no idea there's their demon spirits waiting just for him just for the right moment to give entrance give me a spot where i can come in and then the philistines be upon you samson notice when it says in verse verse verse nine there were men lining me wide in the chamber she said the philistines be upon them and he broke the widths as the thread of a toe is broken when it touches the fire so his strength was not known you know it never says that those men who were lying in way ever busted through the doors when she said that the philistines be upon them they never came out you know what they were doing they were waiting to see but they were still there lingering just for the right moment in the right time and then stella says you've lied to me you've mocked me you've told me lies verse 11. he said unto her if they'll bind me fast with new ropes that never walk by then shall be weak and be as another man delilah took ropes bound him therewith said and then the philistines be upon thee samson and there were liars there it is again there were liars in weight abiding in the chamber and he broke them from off his arms like a thread they never came out they never attacked you know that's the deceitfulness of sin that just because your life seems to be going good and everything's fine and you're doing the wrong thing making the wrong chase choices sneaking behind mom sticking behind dad you got a separate life that you live oh it's just fine there's liars and weight waiting you may not see them and he broke them from his arms she says in 13 you've told me lies tell me where thou mightest be bound he said in there if they we if they weave us to seven locks you notice notice what's happening it's getting closer started here in his hands then it goes to his arms then now it's moving up closer closer now it's in his hair it's getting closer and she said he said uh if verse 12 and there were liars in white verse 13 delilah said in the sims and he gave mock me and he says set in there if thou weavest the seven locks on my head with the web and she fastened them with the pen and set of the philistines be upon the samson they woke out of sleep went away with the pen and the beam and with the web and she said how can thou say i love thee when that heart is not with me that was mock me these three times and has not told me where in that great strength lion came to pass when she pressed him daily when she pressed him daily when the devil's after you he presses you daily and in our generation it's hourly it's every minute in fact while you've been sitting here in church there's been notifications popping up on your phone incessant notified notified notified notified look look look you're missing it you're missing it you're missing it if there was ever an age that tries to suppress the voice of god in your life it's now and satan will press you and press you and press you and get you no time if he can do anything he'll give you no time to contemplate and to think and to disconnect get you to go go go go go go go go go next day you got to push on you got to move through what's happening tomorrow what's gonna what's my life gonna look like what's planned and then if satan can do anything he'll get you just to shh tell that voice of god quiet trying to live my life here samson she pressed him daily with her words notice this here in verse 16 and urged him so that his soul was vexed unto death that he told her all his heart said there has not come a razor upon my head for i have been a nazareth unto god from my mother's womb even if i be if i be shaven then my strength will go from me and i shall become weak and i and be like any other man when delilah saw that he told her all his heart and she sent called now the liar's in weight now now they bust through the doors come up this once for his showed me all his heart and the lord of the philistines came up under her and brought money in her hand she made him sleep upon her knees she called for a man she caused him to shave off the seven locks of his head and she began to afflict him that his strength went from him she said the philistines be upon the samson and he awoke notice young people he awoke out of his sleep and said i'll go out as other times before as last year at camp and the year before the out is going i'll come to the altar and once again i'll repent and i'll get clean about his way to youth camp and surely i can just keep doing these things because i'll just go out as other times before we'll have another youth meeting and then i'll get free of it then don't talk to me about it now there'll come a day in my life when don't worry i'll eventually surrender i'll go out as other times and shake myself and he whists not that means new and he knew not that the lord was departed had no idea that's why i said the saddest part of the story is not us maine of man samson's story is not about a strong man it's about a very weak man it's not about the strength of man it's about the weakness of man samson your purpose you had a plan you had a blueprint god ordained it got anointed it he wrote it he drew it yet you at every point in your life and every time you had to make a choice you made the wrong one the wrong one the wrong one the wrong one the wrong one and those choices were leading leading leading leading you may have not noticed you were moving at all you may not have realized that you were going a certain direction because i was still coming to church i was still there i was still in the same home but all the while their hearts slowly turning turning hardening you have no idea what's taking place in your heart you have no idea he knew not the lord was departed verse 21 but the philistines took him put out his eyes brought him down to gaza bound him with fetters of brass branham said brass represents judgment fetters of brass and now samson's bound his eyes are out you know let me just say something to you here tonight samson was blind long before they put his eyes out samson was bound long before they put physical chains on him you see bondage comes in all kinds of forms bondage comes in not just physical outward manifestations sicknesses other than cancer in the flesh there's also cancer of the spirit and of the soul there's also spiritual blindness and spiritual deafness and in fact deafness and blindness is just a spirit that's all it is doctors treat the physical but brother branham said it's it's a it's a spirit deafness is a spirit blindness that's why jesus in mark 9 tells the man who could the the dumb and deaf man he says thou dumb and deaf spirit come out of the man and i command you not to enter him again it wasn't the disease it was a spirit that was on him and sampson's life has allowed an entrance to spirits in his life and now he's blind just an outward representation of what took place in his heart he's bound just an outward representation of what happened what was slowly wrapping him and binding him and eventually samson's life a life that was called for a purpose a life that was charted a life that had a specific course a life that had a moment a moment of decision a moment of decision where you could go left or you could go right and you know what young people no mom's gonna make that choice for you no dad can make that choice for you that's something that happens right here and no no no no nobody as much as we wish as much as a parent would wish oh i wish so bad i could i could fill them with the holy spirit i wish so bad i could surrender for them i wish so bad lord but you can't you've got to make that choice and that decision for yourself the sadness of this was that delilah's name even her name means to slack off did you know that that's what delilah's name meant to ease up her name means ease up slack off lose this is what it means because this is what the devil's plan was his plan was to rob him and to strip him of power and strength and so her name means to slack up to slack off to ease up and i love this one to lose intensity samson starts off strong with life and he separated unto god of nazarite and then 20 years go by and nothing's talked about about samson doing anything for the lord doesn't talk about the spirit of god moving upon samson's life no more mighty victories for israel but he grows weary he grows cold he grows carnal and he's laying in the lap of delilah very manifestation of what had happened in his life or even her name means to lose intensity to relax just to let off to let up if there was ever a time i could come from south carolina and i could tell you young people here in georgia if there was ever a time to not lose your intensity it's right now if there was ever a time to wake up and shake yourself if there was ever a time to surrender and say lord let me value the spirit of god could you bow your heads with me young people could you ever head bowed maybe you with no one looking around you could raise a hand i'm not even going to look i'm going to keep my head bound maybe you could raise a hand and say lord don't let me lose my intensity right now let me value the presence of god in the spirit raise your hand and say lord i want your spirit of god maybe i don't have it i want it man i want that enabling power and that enabling force to dwell in my life to consecrate my vessel to fill me to cleanse me of every impure thing maybe you can do that young person with a hand raised and say lord i want to surrender to that blueprint that you've drawn i want to surrender to that charted course that you've planned it'll never work it's not worked lord i want to i want to live in the atmosphere you or you created me to live in i want to stop fighting how many could say i surrender by an uplifted hand it's a sign of surrender to say lord i'm going to surrender right now god sees those hands up both of my hands are up right now say lord let me fully surrender to the purpose of god in my life how many could raise a hand i'm going to raise mine up and say lord let me be that one vessel that you can get under your complete control where you fully get under your complete control let me be sold out let me be so down dedicated oh if there was ever an age where we need people that are sold out to the purpose and the plan of god of their in his life it's right now so lord i just surrender right now asking you father to come and cleanse me of every unpure thing cleanse me jesus these young people that are here tonight musicians could you return maybe you just want to say lord i want to rededicate my life i want to renew my vow my dead my dedication to my consecration i want to renew it right now could you raise a hand young person every head bow don't be looking around say lord it's my desire to serve you it's my desire to live a separated life even the musicians even you that are gathered up here today maybe you want to raise a hand and say lord that's my life that's my desire that's my prayer lord and maybe i'm at that valley of decision lord let me make the right choice let me not just treat let me not just go through life just aimlessly just going down a pattern and going down chasing a certain dream let me stop right now and say lord i want to step onto the plan that you've called for my life granted lord every hand every life every heart that's lifted up to you right now jesus you've called us to be different and what makes us different lord nothing else but your spirit that dwells inside of us let it be jesus fill our young people with the baptism of the holy ghost fill them lord if they've been filled let them be refilled tonight jesus let them be refilled with a renewed vision i spoke to men let that man realize his position dominion and take control and subdue his nature let me walk in the spirit granted lord to my life i raise my hands right now let me walk in the spirit lord grant it jesus let us value your spirit for lord without that your prophet said it's the lifeline it's the bloodline it's the lifeline of a church it's what gives it life may not have much lord we may may be simple simple people with simple faith but that's who you choose lord you don't choose the great things of life you don't choose the grandeur the glitter you said the gospel your prophet said it doesn't glitter but it glows with the holy spirit and satan's got an entire eden there's people who live after that eden they can live off of it they can it can satisfy them this world can satisfy them even though even the your prophet said even the hybrid church with her modernized civilized modernized theological educated intellectual church hybrid they can live off that maybe that's what gives them maybe that's the purpose and the fulfillment of what you've called them to but lord i raise my hands today and say lord i don't need more intellect i don't need more knowledge i don't need more of that what i need is more of your spirit of that enabling power to come and dwell my vessel to give me power to live above sin to overcome the enemy just to overcome his snares and his traps that he's placed in my life [Music] fill us lord god of your spirit that ruok that breath of god oh could you stand to your feet young people could you stand to your feet and raise your hand and say lord breathe on me one more time jesus let your life breathe upon me o god let it flow jesus through my body let it flow through my spirit let it cleanse my conscience and my memory my imagination my affection let it flow as the song says flow through me what are you saying lord let your spirit let your purpose let your anointing
