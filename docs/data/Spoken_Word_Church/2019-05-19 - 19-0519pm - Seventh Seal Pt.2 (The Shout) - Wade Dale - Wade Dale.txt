You Father bless the missionaries on the foreign fields give them fruit for their labor bless each one today Lord just give a supernatural strength and supernatural revelation we ask these things in Jesus name Amen all right and we were talking last Sunday on the Seventh Seal just trying to get the seal part out which there's really nothing to it just when the seal opened there was nothing there was silence in heaven right here verse 8 or 8 verse 1 and when he had opened the Seventh Seal There was silence in heaven about the space of a half an hour you may be seated in the Lord at his blessing to the reading of the word now with this being one of the greatest times that's ever been on the face of the earth brother Branham said he'd never worked in a greater realm he had seen many things go on in his ministry starting back in the early even in the in the 30s in the 40s 50s and 60s there early 60s but he was working in a realm that white had never he had never worked in that spear before why because the the totality of the word was opening up God was bringing something that he had not he had not given to any one man except the man himself Jesus Christ that when he was on the earth he preached the very word of God without any any error so now if Jesus Christ can come and preach three-and-a-half years with no error then certainly we should know that Jesus Christ coming back in the end time in a bride would do the same thing not have all this confusion that we have and all these different doctrines and we can do this and we can't do that when we go do this and you know they made the seventh seal the reason they made the seventh seal everything in the world but what it's supposed to be is because they don't have a revelation all right need to get a revelation you've got to really pray to God that he'll reveal this because like I said if I put the black ball today it would just stay blank the whole time there's nothing to write there's nothing to write on that board anymore no we've been through a whole year of writing things on the board and putting this up here and putting that up here but with the seventh seal that was silence in heaven so there's nothing to write it's just a whiteboard and it will stay that way because there's nothing else to be revealed as far as like we were talking about seal number one two three four and one each one meant we've come to a seal now to where it's a total mystery and even brother branham said said that that Satan is not even going to be able to in person they'll see Satan can impersonate a lot of things but when when you come up to a time where the word of God's preached in its fullness and its entirety and its maturity then we know one thing for sure Satan cannot impersonate that now he can go so far he can go so far and he can get so close because remember we're talking about Christ in you the hope of glory but remember the Bible says that there will be false Christ's false anointed ones in the end time they'll try their best to get so close but they'll never be able to break open the mystery of that seal you and I are the only people the people that are here at the end those who endure to the end shall be saved I still enjoy that that scripture there in Matthew because that's what it is it's going to be an endurance a you know it's there's gonna be battle-scarred veterans the prophet of God said this is not a picnic when it bring knives and forks we brought swords and shields and Spears to this battle and then you know why it's a battle for you to overcome just to come to church that's why it isn't overcome I may be really easy for us all to set home this morning in and you know made us a couple of eggs and a biscuit and turned the tape recorder on and hit play that has nothing in the Bible to do with your Christianity zero hone Sundy brother Brown said you can't wait till the doors open to get in church what to fellowship not with each other but to fellowship with God right and so to overcome it was an overcoming battle for us to get up and have to come it's an overcoming battle for you to sit here without going to sleep hey man right so I preach to the overcomers you just get the regular ones that come I get all the overcomers well some don't that he does that's right that would thank you that's good yep brother Dale helps you to overcome to get to this point yeah but really enjoying the series there this morning if you don't know if you don't know anything about being being spiritual that goes right with what we're talking about right now right here same you there is no way you can get you can get out of the seals and then out of the Bible it's all in the Bible it all is the part of salvation it's a part of your Redemption in my Redemption all right it has nothing to do with this outside world because the seven seals are to us now sure it occupies I mean it happens out there but now right now none of that is happening you don't see the Antichrist has not become incarnate yet he's working toward it but what God is doing is he's becoming incarnate in us at first and then Satan's going to do so see we get we get even even though we we're not going to be here when the actual play happens we're actually the participants where were the recipients of all this we get to see the the preview you know and when you watch movies they give you a trailer give you a little snippet of what's going on well this is not a trailer this is not just a snippet this is the movie this is the preview God's already previewing what's going to happen through us and then it's going to happen to the outside world now we've been through that many many times even in the sixth seal how the disruption of nature is going happen because of you what are you saying brother wait listen the seventh seals not going to open without you oh yeah it's open to the airwaves and it's been preached by the Prophet and and it's been revealed to him I would say what was going on but he found out he wasn't a real recipient of it it's just gonna be the ones that are here now that are alive and remained because the seven seals not to the sixth dimension it's to this dimension all the seals are to this dimension and it's in your dimension that you're gonna be able to see it amen so it is for all of us it's not something that we can we can't shun this we can't kick it over to the side this is something you and I have to participate in this the seven seals is the mystery of everything that's been holed up in the Bible has been revealed to you and I it's been brought to us now we've had 50 something years 60 years since the prophets gone and what have we done I don't think we've went up the elevator far enough I was telling this morning where I was kind of you know sometimes you sit back and go well God why'd you send this message I mean well we know why but then you look at and say well you know what came to me was is you've got this big beautiful skyscraper and and this thing they build it you know 100 and something storeys high and it's really pretty but what's the essence of that of that building that building sure number one is there's not enough space so they're gonna let you you know build vertically but it's the view you go up to the top of this and you have a view or you see more than you've ever seen before when you get to the top I think josh has been to the Empire State Building have you yes josh is putting an interstate building twice and I mean you can see forever because you're up there but how did you get up there and sister Trudy McMillan said well steps I said well if you want to go 150 floors and steps you go right ahead but God's give us an elevator we've got an elevator that goes all the way to the top and then you know if you ever rode in an elevator like when I was in the Philippines you're you know you get into elevator and there's a guy standing there or girl that matches the buttons for you that's kind of a perk of being in a five-star restaurant but brother wishing normally get so high you can only go to a certain level because the rest of that's private it's for the penthouse this for the people that pay more than you paid but you know what that little girl you don't have a key but that little girl of that guy he's got a key or he's got a code that when you go to for 142 there's eight more floors left well now you don't get a real good view at flow 142 but now at 150 if when you walk out on top of that penthouse but you gotta have somebody there to turn the key that's why God sent a prophet God didn't send a prophet for us to become religious God didn't send a prophet to tell us how to dress and how to do all that sure he had to do it because a man because of man putting their ideas in it brother brown did changed the Bible I'm sure he met people he said he met people that had the Holy Ghost the same as as he did in a long time before the message see sometimes we think the message is this whole know the message is what we're talking about today the essence of the message or the opening of those seven seals something that's never been where that man had to turn that key so we could go on up for that eight more floors or ever how many floors let's say seven let's stay with number seven seven more floors so that we can see what night wasn't that there was nothing there the landscape has always been there right and that's why I say with the word of God the landscapes already been there God wrote this Bible a long time ago we're just thinning the image that he saw and it's become a reality because remember Jesus Christ was a lamb slain before the foundation of the world right is that good enough that's not good enough that was in his mind Christ had to come down here and physically do it because it was the mind of God it had to develop God doesn't have a thought that that well I'll think of listening oh no that's not the way you want to do that way let's try another way no God's thoughts are eternal so as his thought goes out it's got to happen and he became material one day 2,000 years ago that this man we called Jesus Christ came on the earth and he was literally crucified so that you and I could see it by our faith we see it amen we see that Christ was crucified and he was crucified not for you he's crucified for me and you got to feel the same way because it's a personal revelation as brother Dale is talking about the new birth is a personal revelation of Jesus Christ to you a personal revelation something that you can take and hang on to and sometimes you can when you walk out the doors of this church you still got it man that's what I like you still got it when you go out there and get on the job and you got y'all you still got it when you're out there and you got the storms of life or beating against your against your ship you still got it a man is still there to hold on to you where you don't hold on to it a lot of times that holds on to you so talking about the simple plan of salvation is what this seal is all about you said well it's the greatest thing said what's the greatest thing ever happened to you salvation the greatest thing ever happened to you is you got born again and then you say well I know it's the change of the body if you don't get born again first you can forget about the change of the body forget about the journey down through the road down the road the over comings and all that because there's got to be over cuz you've got to overcome a lot of things but when you get down to the end of the road that's when your body's gonna be changed well listen we're almost down to the end of that road now something had to come to us though to turn us to turn us not not just turn now I just turn us to well I used to smoke now I don't I used to cut my hair now I don't I used to wear makeup now I don't that's not what this message is all about folks it's not that's what we have spent 50 years majoring on a minor we have majored on people not doing this and doing this and not doing that and we've not got down into the depth of the message - what brother Brown - true essence of this message is that you and I are there's going to be a resurrection and a body change and it's going to come through you and me it's gonna come through you and me it's not gonna come through a book or a special tape no it's gonna come through what you have inside of you when Jesus walked up to the tomb of Lazarus he'd have to pray he had already seen it happen four days ago he didn't have to pray but you know what he said he's a father for the people around me what the weak ones around me I'm gonna pray this prayer but in other words he should have just walked up and said move out of the way Lazarus come out of the grave I know that's it essentially that's what happened anyway all right so that's what we have to come to I was telling them this morning I think that that our Commission should be that we brother Brown tells us and I'll read it it's gonna be on a part of another service besides this one where he's trying to get the people into speaking condition that's something you need to keep in your in your back of your head speaking condition you so I'm I'm what are you gonna put your little whatever's in the blank I'm insufficient I'm I'm I'm embarrassed I'm ashamed well don't worry about that I'm a child of God and I'm gonna do what the Bible says because I have got the I am inside of me and that's what's gonna work out and that's what's with you and I the same thing we've been to these all these great waves and different things that we've come to but we're gonna have to come to see that that if we don't get this and we'll get to in a second about the shout when somebody shouts what do you do I mean if brother Ryan no ain't no way he'll shout if breath if no brother Anderson either they ain't nobody back there that Boyd yeah thank you sure it's sterling with if brother Boyd were to shout right in the middle of the sermon and y'all didn't know anything about it and he just all of a sudden got up and said I don't know if that really then what would your attention would be turned to him why because you heard something that you weren't expecting and ma'am so we'll get into that in just a second so let's read John 19 because this remembered last Sunday we were talking about the number seven I hope yeah if y'all do all weren't here Sunday and you want to get that list that I've pulled off of the internet about the number seven there's several of them right here on the front row if you want to pick them up and sister cleda found out she was born the same day Adam was same year sister Clara is she she calls on the phone and she just left my grandmother my grandmother used to call and she said wait I need you to cut the grass grandma grandma grandma nope that's what she wanted you to do and she hung the phone up there wasn't nobody forced you hung her phone so clean a call though that I hung my phone she said I just want you to know that that's the same man Adam going on the same or that same day that I was born Dale Adam was born his young phone - me this morning she did you get my message I said I got it loud and clear lady a few words and that's okay but we were talking about the segment about the number seven but then we got into where brother Branham will read in a minute cuz I want you to keep this in your back to your mind cuz we got to fit this puzzle together brother Brown said the Seventh Seal is the end of all things now the end of all things does not mean remember with God and end it's not a total annihilation because even when he can't we come to the end of the world everybody talks about the end of the world well now listen the end of the world is just the beginning of the world that God's gonna produce amen yeah man the end of the play even when you come to the end of the play and there's no more acts what do you do you have that play to remember you have all the motions that got you to the very end of the play and it was just an end of that scene so this is just an end of the scene just like brother Dale's tell about this morning your life in my life when it comes to if it does come to an end that's just the beginning for a Christian it has come to an earthly end and even when Jesus said hear Jesus therefore receive the venery vinegar he said it is finished bowed his head and gave up the ghost now there was not one other word said not one other word said by Jesus Christ himself in this dimension until he walked out of the tomb on Sunday morning but now remember one thing according to the world nothing was going on I said according to the world nothing was going on they had already put this guy this lunatic was dead he was in a tomb they had sealed it up and put a Roman seal on it sealed that baby up and put guards beside just to make sure nobody got in there to get him out right so he was dead to the world he was dead there was nothing going on that Saturday was a high silence so all of your Caiaphas and all those different priests they had to do the Passover lamb they had to do judi they had to do whatever they did on the on the high Sabbath is with the Passover and all that and then it was a day a Sabbath day so they just continued on Jerusalem and the whole world just continued on just as they were not sure there was a small group of people but now remember even that small group of people that were Jesus's closest closest followers thought he was dead right they thought he was dead it was done it was over with I heard the one that we thought was going to come in and take over the world he's gone and we've never seen somebody come out of a tomb like that not sure now they might have stood around at Lazarus tomb and saw Lazarus raised from the dead but eventually Lazarus was gonna die again alright so they weren't looking listen to what I'm saying is they weren't looking for anything special they weren't looking for anything supernatural their Lord had died whoever that was that they thought he was the Messiah you see all the doubt that Satan puts in the mind when when we get to looking at things on the surface and we say he's dead just like right now I'm telling you everybody takes well the words dead there's nothing going on there's no there's no great move of God well the great move of God better be inside of you that great move of God better be something that on Monday morning you get up and say God thank you for getting me up tell me something else about you hey man and then you know what the world is not gonna know anything about it but God he was dead the body was cold dead in the grave on Saturday all day Saturday it was until dead and you know what the people could walk by they see that ceiling they see the guard standing there and they see that seals stuck up there nothing was going on but the greatest thing in the world was happening is this man called Jesus Christ was now in his theophany he had went to another dimension to fulfill Scripture to preach to the souls that were in prison what condemning that group of people but then he steps into paradise another dimension and picks up all those people in paradise and takes them wherever they go so he wasn't was he busy absolutely there was no there's no time that God's not busy we're talking about God being you know taking a rest day the seventh day my he hasn't rested he just rested from making everything amen he rested from the creation God's never had to rest thank God for that can you imagine us being in a glorified body Colette's exactly what you and I are going to believe we're not ever gonna have to rest if we sit down it's because we want to and when we stand up brother Holly won't be will have to get up in parts right how many of y'all are to the point to where you have to get up and shifts oh yeah yeah you have to get up and shift legs legs move one of them goes off amen second one goes off then you say back can you get me up yeah then you stand down June June will stand up for me and she'll go and then she'll start walking I think she's getting her get she's getting in gear so she can so she can move but but that's what we got to look forward to because you know what when this thing is over with we ain't got to do that in the morning so that's why we're heading toward that body change that us older people are looking more forward to than the younger ones the time goes on you younger ones to realize that you have to get up in shifts so Jesus was dead I mean it looked like there was nothing going on same thing when you come to this great Seventh Seal like I said no blackboard with nothing on it whiteboard with nothing on it so where you going you go man this is the board this thing never happened well it's the greatest thing that ever happened because what God's doing is is God has moved us into the Holy of Holies where remember the Holy of Holies unless somebody told them what was back there nobody saw what was in that Holy of Holies is that one person and then he had to come out and tell you what was going on inside there but now what happens now that when Christ has died and come back in the form of the Holy Ghost inside of you then that Holy of Holies has been opened up the the veil was ripped from top to bottom they ought to realize something in that temple only something supernatural could have rent a 20-foot veil from top to bottom now from bottom to top you could have done it you could got to people and pulled it but if things 20-foot high God ripped that thing open to show in plain view what the Seventh Seal or Christ Jesus Christ hanging on the cross but when he said it is finished we've got to get to a place to where we see the word finished and end and all that now what do you and I think of we think of you know done but listen when we get to the end of this service is that end does that end everything no you got to go outside fellowship get in your car go home get up tomorrow go back to work we've ended this service but we've not ended life and even when your life ends and we looked at you and say well they look just really nice there's nothing going on in this dimension but they're over there in another dimension shouting and praising God and meeting all the ones that are already over there so when we get to this the seventh seal is the end of all things we must remember that it is only the beginning of the greatest thing that will ever happen to you and that'll be your body changing and then the greatest thing that will happen and it'll have to come from nothing external will change your body we've tried to do that before we were talking about stuff downstairs you know if you don't have a hair put some hair on if you don't have teeth put teeth in you know all these thing you do that because you're human because you do it on this side okay but now God's not that way God's adding all the time he's adding should be at should be adding to your spiritual walk every day some little something some little some little way and and maybe even your husband or wife or you children don't know anything about it at the time but something's going on inside of you and Manco that's the real person is the real user once inside we're brother Branham said I'm not looking at the real youth he said you're not looking at the real man the real me is inside here and that's what God's doing that's what I'm telling you the greatest mystery the great mystery of revelations ten seven when the mysteries to be revealed is that God sent a prophet to tell you your God take seals vials plagues Daniel seventy weeks all the great marriage and divorce boil it down to one thing God's gonna do all that through somebody in human flesh and Satan can't stand it cuz remember what brother Brown said brother Brown said if I long as I hide it where'd he hide it he's not hiding in a in a box or hiding it in a book he's hiding it in his heart he says long as I hide something in my heart he said the devil he can't get in there said but now when I start speaking it out and I say I'm gonna go this way he said you want kids we'll start crying and you know mother-in-law's will come over and father-in-law's will come over and all these things will happen you know right brother Anderson said yesterday man you didn't have to raise your hand brother that's all right gotta have him what about Solomon he had a thousand wives and a thousand mother-in-law and he was the wisest man on earth that's why it was wise he had a thousand mother-in-law's we'll talk about that one after church Ephesians 4:30 says grieve not the Holy Spirit of God will buy your sealed until the day of your Redemption as brother Dale's talking about now and I wanna I didn't oh I did I brought the quote listen to this you don't have this so just listen to it it's on the breach a seal signifies now this word I got from the dictionary a seal signifies a finished work alright and when the seventh seal is broken the mystery of God mystery one mystery of God that sealed in these mysterious seals is finished until the day that seal is broken then it's revealed what's on the inside of it listen if the man's wondering what's in that boxcar you say it's supposed to be such and such they're supposed to be he's presuming but when the seal is broken and the door is open we see into it then and see exactly what's in there you see and that only be done at the end time and that's exactly what's happened it's been sealed you have been sealed but you've got to be able to produce what's inside amen we will every person will produce what they are inside you won't be able to help it not in the end time you can hide it in different places but you can't hide it now you will be made known one way or the other either God or the devil so let's read this right here real quick number one we're just gonna go over a few uh a few from last Sunday if that's all right review it just a little bit let's go down to where it says this is revelations chapter five I love this quote he breaks the seals go down to the rib or up to the red he breaks the seals reveals gives us his inheritance to his people he gives the inheritance that he inherited becoming kinsman redeemer and freely gives it out to us it all belong to him and he's the one who redeemed but instead of keeping it his self he gives it back to his people that's his love for us now we know what now he didn't have to inherit eternal life in his spirit or his soul he was Almighty God he was eternal life but he inherited eternal life in his body he went through that process well remember when we were talking about the silence the sigh Jesus Christ's body was laying there cold and dead but that was it was getting ready to produce something that had never been produced before when that Christ came back into that body it changed that body into an eternal body that's the inheritance that he inherited by going and doing what the scripture said because remember brother Brown said God was withheld by his own word in that three days period right he couldn't come out because the Bible says he will not leave a soul in Hell neither stuff with my Holy One to see corruption so he had to wait go and do the work that he was doing and then when he come back and brother aid when he when he stepped in that body it changed that body into a young eternal person and he inherited that and now he's going to freely give it to me and you it's just what the problem is is we've had to wait 2,000 years and it seems like they're silenced it seems like there's nothing happening oh sure they had great revivals but they're all dead Wesley Luke or all those people they're all in a grave I mean they're all their bodies in the grave but they're over in another dimension waiting on one group of people one group of people to catch this mystery sure they knew that Christ was in them the hope of glory they could read the Bible but they didn't get the hold they didn't have the guy that turned the key to get them on up seven more floors to get the seven seals open to where you get to the seventh seal and all you do is you see just what as far as you want to see a man and that's what I think that's what the Bible when they become a brand-new book to the Prophet it's become a brand-new book to me and it should become a brand-new book to you it should be where you when you read this Bible I'll promise you if you'll read the Bible with a Holy Ghost revelation you will say in yourself where did that come from cuz I just read that the other day I think somebody added something that's how much you'll read that and you'll think man I've read that 14 or 15 times and all of a sudden right I'm have you done that you just just you almost swear that wasn't in there two weeks ago why because God's bringing you step by step as you need it and that's the same way with these seven seals he didn't just drop the seven seals not 7th ceilings preach on it no he started with one two three four because remember seven is his completion or his perfect number and we'll read that but he breaks the seals and gives us the inheritance so that inheritance that break in that seventh seal is eternal life in your body you already got eternal life in your body I mean it's our life of your body amen folks were either heading to that and we're heading to agree because we're not going to keep going on and and this is going to stay the way it is it's gonna be one of the two all right so let's read the next one the breech number two now when we go to breaking the seals you're gonna see it goes plumb back in the scripture all the way back well now what does he go back to it goes all the way back to Genesis we're gonna say that brother Donnie this is not far from that Genesis 1:26 man when the seals are broke you're gonna see that Genesis 1:26 man is you it's you because that's Christ but it's you then when we get into breaking these seals you're gonna see it goes plumb back in the scripture all the way back for each one of these seals the whole thing together the whole mystery now if you want to know mystery you're met the mystery is Christ in you the hope of glory the mystery in you is is that your body is going to be changed while you're standing here alive the whole mystery lays right here in these seals not any other things not new years of preparation not let no in the seals see every mystery of the Bible lays in these seals and the seals cannot be broken until that time what this time alright notice now the book remember seal here's one here's a seal it's a book of redemption so anything when you talk about seven seals that's why that people they make it everything in the book but Redemption because you know what redemption is too simple for people supposed to be supposed to be well that's just getting saved brother wait that's just you know turning a new leaf or that's just crying and shouting why brother that's just you know laundry list that's I believe in the message no it's not you can believe its message every day you're laughing you're dying go to hell but you can't have the one that brought the message inside of you you can't have the one that brought this message inside of you and dying go to hell I'll promise you that cuz it'll take you right to heaven and whole thing together makes the book but it's the book of redemption so everything we need to think about it's just like I said before it should be the book of redemption from Genesis to revelations a complete plan of redemption is revealed in these seven seals oh it's an important time god help us to get and I see that was on the breach brother Graham hadn't even started on the seals and my when he started in them did he have a did he have a shock cuz all the one yeah all the old notes he used to have he had to throw them away this is all new to me said this there's not anything compared to what I had before Wow but you know once he had it he gave it to me in you so you and I should have it the same way if God corrected the prophet and brought the word to us what is our problem he's brought the pure word let's just do what he says number three look what we've seen in this day the quickening power has come to us to open the Seventh Seal now like I said last Sunday now when you say quickening power that goes back to that old Pentecostal idea that we have that we got to be speaking in tongues shouting throwing hair pins and all that other stuff right all of that quickening none of that happened during the whole week of opening the seals sure they rejoice and had a good time amen but there was no brother Brown had a healing service after the questions and answers right and it was just laying hands on the people there wasn't so much discernment or hardly anything he would just lay hands on the people and going through the line so what what is the quickening power it's the opening it's God coming in opening the seals and bringing them to you what was it the intelligence of a man no the quickening power of God see when you get a revelation from God it has to come from God number one and it has to be something that quickens you God don't just that's all the way in you you know you get a revelation is that God has quickened something in your life because it has to be personally to you so I can't say well I got the same revelation brother ray did that's the same exact time he did no that's he's personal and he person he's a person God can reveal to him tomorrow what God's revealed to me today God can reveal to him tomorrow God's sovereign but God knows when you need it and that's the whole thing God knew when we needed this he brought it through brother Branham he brought the quickening power to open the book up well now who closed the book back come on our problem is we closed the book back off well God came on the day of Pentecost he came down with a quickening power he must have left I don't think he's ever left when God comes down he don't ever go back up unless he takes up with him because he's coming down here in the shout we're getting to in just a minute he's descending with a shout so that you can hear it he's not shouting so the whole world can hear it now what's happening when we leave that seal that opens the whole world's gonna hear it officially through those two prophets in the sixth seal the whole world's gonna be against them two people but you're not gonna be gone and there's not even going to be listen there's not even going to be a mention of spoken word Church in the newspaper that's ain't nobody there anymore right there's not gonna be in the Gainesville Times they're not gonna write an article said well we don't know about lose the church now they've had a hundred people now ain't nobody see their I believe all y'all go making you didn't catch that did you you should have said Amen but you look but the church is empty let's write an article now they'll never even know we're gone maybe just tell me you acquaintances how many family members might know you're gone but the world's not gonna know we're gone all right let's go to number no let's go down to the oh my god quickening power has come to us to open the seven seals what was that the intelligence of a man no the quickening power of God now look going down to the red keep going he is the one who opened those seals he is those seals but the whole Word of God is Christ so what is the seal what is the opening the seals damn brother branham revealing Christ and where is Christ right now who said are you thank you oh yeah sure freedom okay no really revealing Christ and where's Christ Christ in you the hope of glory so where is this revealing of the cells in you I'm standing fall here all day and have that blank board in front of us it'd be more silence in heaven for hours not just 30 minutes why because I couldn't say anything about what was on that board you couldn't either but if God reveals something to you he can tell you and your secret of your heart and you can keep that thing and we do that he's the one who opened those seals he is those seals for the whole Word of God is Christ and Christ is the seals that was opened what is the opening of seals then revealing Christ now that's own it is the rising of the Sun in 1965 preached after the seals were open so he ought to know what he's talking about now let's go to number 4 the seventh seal we must remember that this seventh seal is the end of time of all things that's what we've been talking about that's right the things written in the seventh sealed book sealed up of the plan of redemption from before the foundation of the world it every bit ends it is the end it's the end of the struggling world it's the end of struggling nature it's the end of everything and there is the end of the trumpets remember all trumpets sounding on the sixth seal amen and the seventh trumpet and the seventh seal is the same we'll get into that later on it's the end of the vials it's the end of the earth now if you take that right there then brother Brown was wrong when he preaches the future home when he says it's not gonna be annihilated it's gonna be renovated we're gonna have a new heaven and a new earth but it's not going to be this earth blown away and God create a new one no it'll be the end of the earth the way we know amen it's the end of the vowels that's the end of the earth it's even the end of time time runs out the Bible said so remember in Revelations 10 7 everything runs out in this time the end of the end of this seventh seal so I don't want you to see something we're going to read several quotes here we're brother Branham talks to end of the seventh seal so the seventh seal is not just I I think that sometimes we take well the seventh still open no it's a continuation right it's a continuation it if you want to be real technical if you want to say something anything about the seals when you got born again I just read you what the Bible says grieve not the Holy Spirit of God whereby you're sealed until the day of your redemption well the seventh seal produced itself when Christ came in you even in your baby form but you didn't know how to handle it like we were talking this morning you know babies are wonderful but you know what if you take a baby and you send it right out there on that street it's gonna go right across that road even if it has to crawl but now at 10 years old hopefully he'll know that the cars are gonna kill him watch the same baby so God's the same way God's 1 it's gotta guide us and that's what he's done through these seals and through your journey he's guided you so we're coming up to the end of the 7th seal the end of the seventh seal will be your body change everything runs out at the end of this seventh seal comes remember the seven seals in a three fold it opened in three folds everybody got that notice it's the end of the church age it's the end of the seven seals it's the end of the trumpets it's the end of the vials it even ends the ushering in of the Millennium that's on the seventh seal everybody got that say Amen alright so now let's get reading number five and in Sabina canyon he said this is the third pole and there's three great things that go with it one unfolding today or yesterday the other one unfolded today and there's one thing that I cannot interpret because in an unknown language now don't get caught up with that we'll break that down later on but I was standing right there and look straight at it and this is the third port of what brother Brown what is the third Pole it's the opening of the word you can call it everything in the world but it's the opening of the word all right the third pull is the opening of the word all right and this is the third pole coming up the Holy Spirit of God oh my that's the reason all heaven was silent oh my just shows us from God for it fits exactly in the promises of God from the end of the message you notice now for the end of time message remember I told you that's the name of this seal this is the end of time seal I'll tell you because that's what he said with him for the end of time message this seal after all he's revealed all the six seals but it don't say nothing about the seventh in other words put the board up here and draw me the seventh seal can't do it it's nothing all right and the end time seal when it starts will be absolutely a total secret according to the Bible all right what's it now what does he go to revelations 10 1 through 7 at the end of the seventh angel's message all the missions of God will be known we're at the end time the opening of the seventh seal now the Seventh Seal was spoke of since Genesis when God said let us make man in our image he started the process of the seventh seal because that was Christ amen now Christ didn't have a beginning but the Bible says the beginning of the creation of God so we got to see a beginning of our beginning for us a development of God I want I want to ask you something can you see more about God now than then then when you started your journey think about that now that's not you because Satan don't want nothing to do that he hates your progression he don't want us to grow up amen because see he met a growing God one time that defeated him by the word amen and that's what he's gonna meet again he's gonna meet a grown God not a baby God a grown-up God to defeat him by the word alright for the end of time seal when it starts will be absolutely a total secret according to the Bible and I believe that if it started then right here we're close to the ending of it what we say the ending are the culmination of what redemption for us now remember this is special it's for us this seventh seal in sting all things for me and you because listen when we go ahead when we step out on this earth and our body has been changed the dead Saints have already come here so death has been destroyed your body is going to be changed what's left you're finished it is the end of redemption for you amen that's why many people misinterpreted brother Branham when he was talking about Redemption being over now when the seventh seal produces itself Redemption will be over but now remember it won't be over for the world it won't be over for the 144,000 it won't be over for the foolish virgin a cup of water in my name Redemption will continue all but for you and me it will produce itself and that'll be the end of it like I said many times here we go again we don't have to stand any judgment we're already judged we're already judged so there's no judgment of that sure there's little things but I'm talking about whether you're gonna be go to heaven or go to hell that got settled when you received the baptism of the Holy Ghost cuz the baptism the Holy Ghost only went to hell one time and you went there with him God Himself went to hell and you went there with him she ain't gotta go no more alright so thank God for that so I see our judgment is over even right now your judgments over but we got to come to a place to where that what's inside of us is working its way out all right let's look at number six let's read this quit God 7 is God's perfect number that's what we were talking about last Sunday God's perfect number is 7 now remember what is 7 7 is 4 plus 3 4 is the number of redemption 3 is the number of perfection in 7 your complete all right God's perfect number 7 and we're read to you how many there was 800 and sometimes in the Bible it's on that piece of paper if you want one number 7 and count now what does God do he starts with his number 7 that's God's number all right that's why the 7 still when it produces itself that puts God on the scene that's his number all right let's look at number 8 now the church has 7 Church ages and that's a complete number of the church age that's all 7 7 is God's completed number everybody remember that 7 is God's completed number and I want you to understand something I know worse I know that we go into an 8 we all know that but you got to go through 7 first you gotta go through 1 2 remember he read on countdown he said man starts backwards and counts down 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 he said God doesn't countdown God counts up oh wait a minute God comes up 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 he counts up not down like man does so remember that so now let's read first of all that solonian let's get into this just for a second everybody all right say ma'am first Thessalonians 4 now when we start reading this I'm gonna give you the quotes and it took a prophet to tell us what this was all about it took a prophet to separate this and bring this because you just read it you know what denominations they read that and they go well one day one day this is just gonna happen Lord's going to sin with a shout you know like I told you that brother that denominational guy said I'll be glad when Jesus comes down splits the eastern sky and comes down through the through the clouds and I said well you don't miss the rapture cuz that's after the rapture takes place that's when the whole world ceasing we don't want that no I want the secret part I don't want to be standing here and watch him come down out of the clouds he's all ready to send it out of a cloud amen for this we say unto you by the word of the Lord that we which are alive and remain who is that you remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep for the Lord Himself now that's Himself is personal he's not sending a second person he's not one he's sending himself the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of the Archangel with the Trump of God and the dead in Christ shall rise first that's what I'm telling you don't look for a reservoir and all of for a rapture don't look for your body change we got to get two dead Saints out of the ground first remember God don't skip God goes that God goes you know why because we don't shouldn't skip we should go right in continuity right here the dead in Christ shall rise first then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the lord in the air and so shall we ever be with the Lord now that's the end that's the seventh seal that's the end of our journey when we go over into another dimension we've ended our earthly time as far as human time right but now I want to ask you a question that's we which are alive and remain shall be caught up or changed but now the dead in Christ they're not finished cuz they got to come back here and get their earthly bodies so their journey continues remember the brother branham I'll read you the quote later on the 7th seal brings him back to earth you say well that's that one person Jesus don't come back to earth people until the Millenium so who is Christ Christ is those people that are in that sixth dimension that's what we're missing those people are Christ that's in that sixth dimension right now and they're gonna come into this dimension that's bringing crops back to earth because who's Christ Christ is what in you the hope of glory that's his bride so the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout and that's the first thing we got to look at hey alright well let's say man cuz this is how we get now remember God's been here the whole time he has just been bound up with so much tradition and so much this and that and I didn't do this and I don't do that and this one he's been here the whole time when God came down here on the day of Pentecost he never left he stayed right here alright now let's go to the rapture message now I want you to notice a great thing take place and I don't miss it the word says here in 2nd Thessalonians that there's three things notice from the 13th to the 16th verse there is three things that happens before the Lord Himself appears now remember three is the number of perfection brother Branham saw the seventh still open in a three-fold manner thereby alright the man okay so there's three things happens before the Lord Himself appears now he's not gonna appear in a physical form we got to get away from that he's appearing in you you're the you're the second coming crunch don't come back at the second coming we go meet him in the air Christ only comes into millennium when wind 144 thousands already been sealed the world already been through arming go out wait a minute we've already been changed the earth goes through two witnesses been our 144,000 there's a Battle of Armageddon and then it wipes us off for the Millennium and that's when Christ comes down with us now that's when you see him in a physical form you will not see him before then in a physical one-man form so it has to be bride form from today even if you just take it from today it's got to be bride form from today until that day that he comes into millennium he's always got to be showing him bride form to the Gentiles no not to the Jews but remember he's not going personally the Jews he sent the two prophets a man he's sending two prophets he's not coming himself he's sending two prophets which is what the Word made flesh in two men which is Christ read zechariah they preach Christ so real till they don't say how did you prop two prophets get here the Bible says they they say where did you get those scars he says in the house of my friends now that's got to be two witnesses talking to them and preaching them Christ Oh real till they see what they've done amen they said they see what they've done through them two witnesses and that's the same way with you and I this world is only gonna see Christ through me and you look quickly now we can close we can quickly now we can close the first thing happens a shout a voice of trumpet let's read it now keep going up for the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout and with the voice of the Archangel and the Trump of God three things happen a voice a shout a voice a trumpet to happen before Jesus appears now a shout Jesus does all three of them when he's descending so when he's descending these three things are gonna happen a shout what is the shout it's the message going forth now not the message in books our quote books the message in you if the message going forth first the Living bread of life bringing forth the bride bringing forth the bride talking up to you what about that let's keep reading the rapture number 10 this is goes on down a little bit further I cut a few of the paragraphs out the first thing comes when he starts descending from heaven there's a shout now we got to understand some things and look at these remember I talked about the onion peel onions got a real thin layer and you just keep peeling it off and you just keep peeling it off and peeling it off same way with the Word of God because remember this is this is saying if you read it like brother Brown said it that means that God didn't come into that pen or the Holy Ghost didn't come on the day of Pentecost it that we've had nothing from now that's not true we've had the Holy Ghost in its part in its part but this is coming to the seventh seal the completed part all right when he starts descending from heaven he's talking about this church age he's talking about this age we're living in now alright what is it a message to get the people together now I don't know if that's happened or not let's read it real slow it's a message to get the people together has he got us all together yet hmm we can't get 10 preachers to step in the same building together without having an argument but you know what like brother Dale said you know the the disciples walked with him for three and a half years saw him go through all that resurrect and they still wondered what he was doing are you going to restore Israel are you gonna do this yeah but we should be way past that to get the people together a message come forth first that message we've had now now now now lamp trimming time the message has come forth first stop right here now now lamp trimming time rise and trim your lamps what watts was that the seventh not the sixth the seventh said behold the bridegroom cometh rise and trim your lamps and they did some of them found out they didn't have oil in their lamps see but its lamp trimming time now he goes back to the five wise and the five foolish virgins the but the five foolish virgins they were virgins and they were wise some of them but then you had five foolish virgins the wise virgins trimmed their lamp and went up what they got called away behold the bridegroom cometh in other words the shout what's the shout coming from the shout is not coming from William Miriam Brenham the shout come through him but it's the bridegroom we're not married to brother Branham we're married to Christ okay we're married to cross the word alright Joyce lamp trimming time rise and trim your lamps and they did some of them found they didn't have any all in the lamps why it's getting time what did they say in that scripture what did they tell them we've only got enough for ourselves you want me to interpret that for you let me interpret that whole scenario for you the five wise virgins came to church the five foolish didn't they were foolish the five wise virgins studied their Bible the five wives of virgins did what the Bible said the five foolish virgins did some of what the Bible said they buy all right and hurt your feelings dinner if you don't come to church I guess I did but it wasn't me listen it's time to either be part time if you don't be a part-time Christian you need to go to Baptist Church hello you need to go to Baptist Church cuz you're just hindering yourself you Hitler in this whole church go to Baptist Church get in or get out mo football coach said lead follow or get out of the way so that's exactly what we need to be now because look brother branham didn't say now it's time maybe that we we might need to trim our lamps maybe not no he said now lamp trimming time now either get in or get out rise and trim your lamps where were they they may have been asleep rise and trim your lamps and they did because remember they came in the seventh watch which was later on it was at the end time all right there bouquet with that now that word shout we're gonna go right here and then we'll be done mm-hmm because we're gonna get into something else I want to stop here we're getting something else two Sundays from now not this coming Sunday y'all pray for you brothers it's going to be wasn't y'all this weekend the word shout is an order a command some people take this message as a suggestion or even the Bible that's what said about the commandments it's not Ten Commandments anymore 10 suggestions I mean really an order a command specifically a stimulating cry specifically a stimulating cry either that by which animals aroused and urged by man as horses by charioteers hounds by hunters etc or that by which a signal is given to men what to start a race a lot of times you have somebody say go or start or blow a whistle or blow a trumpet to rowers but at watch will they loud summons a trumpet call to soldiers by a commander that's what I want to say an order or a command that shout came from God to wake up the bride and then we're to trim our Lambs it's lamp trimming time the bride has made herself ready no the wife has made herself ready not the bride we're not bright anymore oh yeah we say that because it's terminology but June's my wife there's a lot of things in 40 years that we've learned about each other that she's not my bride anymore she's my wife she's me in that same way with God there's not a time where brother Brown said yeah I'll call you bride but that's been 50 something years ago we should be off to the wife now now watch this real quick let's look at this let's go to Joshua everybody knows the scenario but watch what happened remember the Seventh Seal There was silence in heaven from the space about half an hour and it came to pass when Joshua spoken to the people that the seven priests bared the seven trumpets a ram horn passed on before the Lord remember the around Jericho listen and blue with the trumpets and the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord followed them and the armed men went before the priests that blue with the trumpets and the rear awards which is the rear of the army came after the art the priests going on and blowing with the trumpet and Joshua had commanded the people saying ye shall not shout or make any noise with your voice but look all that but now what am I saying everything is going on though he's setting up God setting up to destroy Jericho gods give Joshua all this command to put these people in certain places but Joshua says you shall not shout nor make any noise with your voice neither shall any word proceed out of your mouth until the day I bid you shout that's our problem we've been shouting presumptuously because of all these false doctrines somebody will have a shout and people will follow it let's just really dig down into this thing people will follow it Joshua said don't shout don't make no noise neither shall any word proceed out of your mouth until the day I bid now what is it Joshua what is Joshua on top of the Holy Ghost so the Holy Ghost in you until the day I bid you shout then show you show you know what was so miraculous here's Jericho this is the whole scene then we'll close here's Jericho Jericho had walls so big till chariots could run chases run run races around the top of it it was so big there was like a million or so people inside that City they had shut the doors up no doubt they had a big army had to of having a city that big to protect them with but they all shut their self up in the city and now you got now you got the children of Israel and Joshua says don't say a word don't even talk until I tell you to so remember the scenario then they walked one time around for six days then on the seventh day they went seven times but now remember there was silence listen I get unnerved at silence don't you and when these little things going on you know it's so heat coming but when it's dead silence what do you think about that whole big say you take now tape Atlanta and circle it in a big old big old wall all the way around the perimeter of Atlanta that wouldn't be too bad around the perimeter of Atlanta and then here you got this little army of several thousand people they got no guns or anything all they gots them and a couple of trumpets and an art they carry this funny thing around you see what I'm saying if you were looking out from Jericho and you're looking out from Jericho you would think man all the man of war they're getting you can hear the you can hear the spears coming together and you can hear them you know they're getting their gear on and they're putting everything together maybe somebody pops off a few shots just to make sure they're practice and make sure the gun goes off dead silence dead silence for a week they go around the city seven times six times and then on the seventh day they go seven times they don't say a word there's nothing going on but there's something fixing to happen that's what it is will mean you were to the place right now we're getting ready to go around Jericho because the last wall we have is that wall that we have a problem with and that's the body change but what did God say God said Joshua you tell them go around and Joshua said now when I tell you to shout you shall they go around that last day you see the people in Jericho they're just watching them nothing not saying a word zero going on and all of a sudden Joshua says shout and they bring this great shout out of their out of their lungs because you know what they've been seven days ain't said nothing specially the sisters they were busting that's the Saints bent no but left oh that's true with everybody not say something for seven days try but you see this great city and that's what we're looking at now we're looking at the walls of Jericho because there's no way we can knock him down by our own himself but they just walked around it seven times and just stopped and when Joshua said shout they shouted the walls didn't collapse they disappeared they went straight down into the ground cuz there's no way they could have crawled over all that rubble the the ground opened up and the thing went straight down in the ground that was a burial and you know what happened and if you read the rest of this story God put a curse on that city he said cursed be the man that ever makes this city again I tell you cursed be the devil that ever gonna come up against us again he will not win this time he will not win the next time and he will not win any other time so the walls of Jericho are getting ready to come down but what by a silent group of people but remember when they shouted they knew what they were shouting about Joshua told them the seventh time you stop turn toward the wall and shout they got their instructions before they started you and I have got our instructions before we started in this journey we're getting our instructions every Sunday every Wednesday every time you might play you get your instruction because that great big wall of Jericho you know what we got to get through it you we got to get through it we can't go around why don't you why don't you think the children of Israel didn't just go around Jericho hey it was plenty of land thousands of acres on this side of Jordan and thousand acres on this side of Jordan they could have just walked somewhere else brother Danny they could have went and just aborted Jericho no God didn't want them to avoid Jericho God wanted to show the people in Jericho and the people that were his people that he was in command but God didn't come down in a whirlwind God didn't come down in the cloud

shout we are the shout sure we had to hear all these things sure we had to have a Joshua on the scene we had to have the Holy Ghost to instruct us on what to do but on the very day that they took the walls of Jericho down Joshua blew it and set up on a hill somewhere just wasn't with him he was looking far off I think the Bible says he's up here watching his people that's what God is doing he's watching his people and they're doing what he tells them to do and if they do it the right way the walls of Jericho will absolutely disappear anything you need it will disappear let's sing a song god

when a parent sent in the healing saying are we gonna participate no they all participated cuz Joshua was their leader and they wanted that city they wanted that city to fall because God had already pronounced that it was gonna fall and you know what there was one lady inside that city that God had to get out Rahab the harlot the old nasty woman that lived on the red-light district in the in Jericho but you know what God honored her honored her faith and honored her and you know what she said I'm gonna listen to them too brother Brown called him tape boys she listened to him and she said that ain't nothing but the truth she said y'all come on but would you protect me and the two witnesses they said hey get your household together keep them in your keep them in your house and pull that red rope down and I'm sure Joshua instructed them said look destroy everything but that you save ray having her family because she has honored God's people that's why you and I will be people will get
