[26:28] and
[26:29] i want to bring something out
[26:31] tonight
[26:33] that i hope you enjoy
[26:35] we've been
[26:37] meditating on some things and
[26:40] i hope you meditate
[26:42] there's your quiet time i mean if you
[26:43] want to meditate with god yeah meditate
[26:45] with him
[26:46] let him talk to you
[26:48] and it's an intimate relationship
[26:51] amen
[26:52] so being intimate with god and say look
[26:54] i need some help lord or i need this or
[26:56] i need that or and sometimes it might
[26:58] not be a physical need uh maybe it's
[27:00] emotional or maybe spiritual you know
[27:02] maybe something that you a question that
[27:04] you have that's why i like questions and
[27:05] answers brother dale has had questions
[27:07] and answers in this church for
[27:09] 30 or 40 years and that really helps the
[27:12] people
[27:13] it helps you to not have questions
[27:16] what's hard is when you go
[27:19] to another place and you preach and then
[27:21] they haven't been taught
[27:24] and you leave more questions than you do
[27:27] then you and you shouldn't do that
[27:30] but but the way we minister and the way
[27:31] we preach we we try to bring you know
[27:34] some some meat
[27:35] along with the potatoes
[27:37] and um and sometimes it causes people to
[27:40] have a lot of questions and i i i'll
[27:42] tell you one little story it's happened
[27:44] about three times i'm
[27:46] preaching at another three different
[27:48] churches and
[27:50] and you know you're never gonna get
[27:51] called back when the people start asking
[27:53] you questions
[27:55] and um the pastor's not included
[27:58] so
[28:00] you won't get called back to that church
[28:01] i promise you
[28:03] i don't know why they do that i know
[28:05] they try to protect their sheep but if
[28:06] they're sheep starving
[28:09] that's what brother adam was talking
[28:10] about you didn't want to feed them
[28:12] uh what do you call it fireweed or
[28:13] ragweed or whatever that was yeah what
[28:18] yeah loco weed whoa now that's what i'm
[28:20] getting into now brother brown said loco
[28:22] weed you've seen some of these doctrines

[28:58] in the building lord and we pray that
[28:59] you would bless them lord
[29:01] our confession is that by your stripes
[29:03] they're already healed
[29:05] and lord may they walk into it may we
[29:07] all walk into it lord
[29:09] then we'll walk one day we'll walk right
[29:10] into that body change
[29:12] lord somebody's gonna do it
[29:14] and you've already made a way
[29:16] so let it be us lord let us be the one
[29:19] that takes the baton
[29:20] that takes the that takes the revelation
[29:23] lord that you give us in this hour and
[29:24] give it to the people lord we pray lord
[29:27] as you be with the foreign missions lord

[29:35] mistakes that we make lord and may we
[29:37] just for a few minutes let you speak to
[29:39] the people father in jesus name we pray
[29:41] amen
[29:43] john 1 1. in the beginning was the word
[29:45] the word was with god and the word was
[29:48] god
[29:49] verse 14 and the word was made flesh
[29:51] that's important he didn't stay just the
[29:54] word
[29:57] that word became flesh
[29:59] and we'll get into that in a few minutes
[30:01] because you got to have a foundation to
[30:02] get from to get somebody redeemed you
[30:05] got to have a foundation
[30:06] all right and the word was made flesh
[30:08] and dwelt among us and we beheld his
[30:10] glory the glory of the only begotten of
[30:12] the father full of grace and truth now
[30:14] let's go to romans 8 verse 18
[30:16] for i reckon that the suffering
[30:18] of this present time are not worthy to
[30:20] be compared now watch
[30:22] worthy to be compared with the glory
[30:24] which shall be revealed
[30:26] in us
[30:27] now that paul
[30:29] is prophesying
[30:31] there was a revelation for him to get in
[30:33] his time
[30:35] so that revelation was revealed in us at
[30:38] that time a.d whatever that is being
[30:40] spoken 80 50 80 60.
[30:42] but now remember
[30:44] that's past
[30:47] that's past
[30:48] that revelation we got to have plus
[30:52] because we got to have a revelation of
[30:53] the son of man
[30:55] as uh men somebody else was talking the
[30:57] other day
[30:58] god never goes backwards
[31:00] now he'll go get you
[31:02] but he'll never he'll never take his
[31:04] word backwards
[31:06] he'll never reveal you this
[31:09] and then say all right well now next
[31:10] time i'm going to reveal no he moves
[31:12] forward
[31:13] always moving and where is he moving
[31:15] he's always moving up
[31:17] so we've got to move out listen to me
[31:19] close we got to move out of just a
[31:22] revelation of the son of god that we get
[31:24] born again and we have a happy time you
[31:26] know what brother brown said
[31:28] get just enough to get born again
[31:31] live a good life
[31:32] go to church
[31:34] and pass away
[31:37] that's not the son of man ministry
[31:39] we can stay where we're at or we can
[31:41] move up to the son of man ministry but
[31:43] we can't move up and then move back we
[31:46] can go back and get somebody and bring
[31:48] them to this pot that's why brother
[31:50] branham had to be the the first fruit
[31:52] part jesus was the first fruit but
[31:53] brother brown became the first fruit
[31:54] here the first one to come to maturity
[31:57] besides jesus the first one to come to
[31:59] what adoption the first one to come to
[32:02] speaking the word the first one to come
[32:03] to the third pull to what to do what
[32:06] show us it can be done
[32:08] and show us what is going to happen
[32:10] when it happens
[32:12] an example how the world are you going
[32:13] to know an example of something if you
[32:16] don't know anything about it
[32:18] there's no example there like like going
[32:20] to like we're going to ohio
[32:22] um oh you may be seated
[32:25] y'all want to stand up and keep you from
[32:26] going to sleep
[32:30] so you can sit down now i'm sorry
[32:33] but like we're going to ohio and i don't
[32:35] have one i don't have one inkling of
[32:37] what lorraine ohio looks like
[32:41] but i looked it on google maps
[32:44] and i know where it's at
[32:46] because you know why somebody's been
[32:47] there before
[32:48] somebody has mapped it out before
[32:52] and we don't have a google we've got a
[32:53] god
[32:55] it's already been there he's already
[32:57] seen it in his own mind he's seen the
[32:59] whole thing develop he saw the plan
[33:01] before the foundation of the world and
[33:03] he's just waiting on us to fulfill that
[33:06] time that he's already seen amen
[33:09] but let's get into this right here let's
[33:10] go to
[33:11] um
[33:12] well let's finish reading this for i
[33:13] reckon that's the suffering of this
[33:14] present time is not worthy to be
[33:16] compared with the glory which shall be
[33:18] revealed in us so it's got to be
[33:19] revealed in people and it's plural not
[33:22] singular
[33:24] revealed in us
[33:26] not not me the great one and nobody else
[33:28] is going to get it no
[33:30] god's not that way
[33:31] for the earnest expectation of the
[33:34] creature our creation
[33:36] waiteth for the manifestation of the
[33:38] sons of god and as i've said many times
[33:40] before you look in the sixth seal and
[33:43] you see where
[33:44] there's a total disruption of nature
[33:46] brother brown said earthquakes happen
[33:49] tornadoes whatever all that can be
[33:50] called by those two prophets
[33:53] but guess where those two prophets get
[33:54] that anointing from
[33:56] they get that anointing from the bride
[33:58] because right around the coming of the
[34:00] lord we're going to need all that third
[34:02] pull
[34:03] we're going to need that speaking
[34:04] condition we're gonna god's gonna need
[34:07] you to say god needs yeah god needs
[34:09] because he needs him before jesus to
[34:10] fulfill his plan
[34:14] god decided he can't do this by himself
[34:17] i said god decided he couldn't do this
[34:19] by himself with this plan of redemption
[34:21] it takes people
[34:24] it takes people it takes a bride it
[34:26] takes somebody that's alive
[34:28] amen
[34:29] the resurrection message was to live
[34:32] people
[34:33] those angels didn't turn around and look
[34:34] out in the graveyard and say
[34:36] he's not here he's risen know what it
[34:38] was it was to those live people that
[34:40] were standing in front of them
[34:42] to that congregation that come to church
[34:45] and listen to what god had to say for
[34:48] the earnest expectation
[34:50] do we have an expectation
[34:53] you should be expecting
[34:55] listen
[34:58] we expect everything else
[35:01] what's russia going to do
[35:03] what's ukraine going to do
[35:06] what's this one going to do
[35:09] have you ever said what's god going to
[35:10] do
[35:12] have you ever said what's god going to
[35:13] do
[35:14] god what are you going to do today
[35:17] no we get up and say
[35:19] what's my job going to do
[35:21] is my car going to start
[35:23] is my bill's going to get paid
[35:25] is that postal guy going to deliver my
[35:27] mail to me
[35:28] my bills
[35:31] they don't like me sometimes when i
[35:32] deliver all the bills to them but
[35:35] but if we ever
[35:36] changed our as ernie villanueva said our
[35:39] thinking thinking
[35:41] have we reversed that thing to where we
[35:43] are expecting god when we put our feet
[35:46] on the ground what's god going to do for
[35:47] us today or what's god going to do
[35:49] because remember the day starts
[35:52] with you
[35:54] now i'm not trying this is not a
[35:55] feel-good message
[35:57] but when you wake up and put your feet
[35:59] on the floor
[36:00] if you're a bride of jesus christ there
[36:02] is something about that day or the day
[36:05] to come
[36:06] and you're going to sometimes go brother
[36:08] wait i don't even feel like i'm alive
[36:10] well you you got up you are alive
[36:13] all right you did go do something i was
[36:15] listening to brother branham in the
[36:16] adoption series darn he's talking about
[36:18] going back through the adoption series
[36:19] again that brother brown preached
[36:22] he brother brown never said anything
[36:24] about being some great something
[36:27] a little washed woman going about her
[36:28] duties brother brown i'm positionally
[36:30] placed i want to be this everybody wants
[36:32] to be a preacher everybody wants to
[36:33] speak in tongues why can't you just come
[36:35] to church
[36:36] that's a victory for some of y'all
[36:40] a lot of y'all said amen
[36:46] but he said the man with his lunch box
[36:48] under his arm
[36:49] going to work
[36:52] but they got the holy ghost if you got
[36:54] the holy ghost
[36:57] something's going to happen in your life
[36:59] whether you see it or not
[37:01] you're going to influence somebody
[37:03] and that's why
[37:04] we talk about predestinated to adoption
[37:07] we're walking this path that we're on
[37:11] uh thinking about this this morning a
[37:13] little bit
[37:14] or yeah this morning and then you you
[37:16] see that we're on this path
[37:18] god's already know he already knows what
[37:20] it is but you and i don't remember
[37:22] but remember
[37:24] we must be prophetic people in this end
[37:26] time there is a map
[37:29] there is a google earth
[37:31] there is a god
[37:33] that's already seen what you gonna do
[37:36] but now i'm gonna tell you something
[37:37] though
[37:38] like brother matthew was preaching this
[37:39] weekend
[37:41] you're a free moral agent
[37:44] yes or no
[37:45] take it or reject it have a good day or
[37:48] have a bad day
[37:50] right
[37:52] and god
[37:54] is orchestrating
[37:56] what you're going to meet all during the
[37:58] day
[37:59] brother brown said
[38:00] god god
[38:02] will have a brother
[38:04] say something to you to see how you'll
[38:06] react
[38:07] you know what he said god
[38:09] not the devil we blame the devil on all
[38:11] this stuff that we do he said god
[38:14] will put somebody in your in in front of
[38:16] you to see what you'll do about that
[38:18] situation
[38:19] now who's it for
[38:21] not for god
[38:23] not for the guy that spoke it our sister
[38:26] let's don't leave the sisters out the
[38:27] god that spoke it or the sister or
[38:29] brother is for you
[38:32] and how are you it's not like well they
[38:34] stomped off and
[38:35] i don't know why i'm doing this but i'm
[38:36] doing it anyway they stomped off
[38:38] they didn't listen to what i had to say
[38:42] well maybe it was your attitude
[38:45] did you come in a forgiveness attitude
[38:47] instead of a it ain't my fault
[38:51] hey listen this is positionally placing
[38:54] this is adoption i'm not talking about
[38:56] just i'm not talking about just being a
[38:57] good christian because you listen you
[38:59] can be a good christian and not have all
[39:00] these virtues
[39:04] from from from
[39:06] uh 80 30 on the day of pentecost until
[39:09] today
[39:10] there is people that's born again that's
[39:13] not god the virtue that you and i have
[39:21] knowledge
[39:22] temperance patience
[39:24] godliness
[39:26] brotherly kindness
[39:28] you know i wonder sometimes
[39:31] i was reading in the bible i went back
[39:32] through matthew mark luke and john
[39:34] because that is the son of man and that
[39:36] is his characteristics if you want to
[39:37] know what the character the son of man
[39:38] is read matthew martin luke and john
[39:40] because that's the man doing it himself
[39:42] jesus stands up one day and he says i
[39:45] have not come
[39:47] to bring peace
[39:49] now wait a minute
[39:51] through the whole bible he's the prince
[39:53] of peace amen
[39:56] prince of peace mighty god everlasting
[39:58] father he stands up one day and he says
[40:00] i didn't come to bring peace
[40:03] but a sword
[40:04] i
[40:06] have caused a division between father
[40:09] and son
[40:10] mother
[40:12] daughter
[40:14] i have caused that
[40:16] what it's the preaching of the word of
[40:18] the son of man
[40:20] listen
[40:21] we can be mr goody two shoes that's okay
[40:25] but you know what jesus was doing though
[40:26] he was doing it with a heart trying to
[40:28] save them
[40:30] and is that what you're doing it with
[40:35] that's what a pastor
[40:39] like you see brother dale you know a lot
[40:41] of times
[40:42] years ago i may have told you this
[40:44] before but i'll tell it again because it
[40:46] always
[40:47] struck me i thought i thought well man
[40:49] brother dale he's just
[40:51] he's just the best pastor and he don't
[40:52] have no problems and there's nobody you
[40:55] know doing anything wrong in the church
[40:57] and
[40:59] yeah
[41:01] foolish me
[41:03] when i asked when i was out in the world
[41:04] but brother dale would come to my house
[41:07] he'd come to my house later on after
[41:09] y'all got done with him
[41:11] one more time after y'all got done with
[41:13] him some of you were here some of you
[41:14] weren't back in the in the early 90s he
[41:17] come to my house on sunday afternoon
[41:19] he'd say let's watch a hunting video
[41:22] and he'd sit down and he wouldn't say a
[41:23] word and i knew there's something
[41:25] bothering him it was y'all
[41:29] it wasn't me because i wasn't sitting
[41:30] there
[41:32] i'm just kidding but he would i mean the
[41:34] the toil of all that pressure
[41:37] that you don't see
[41:38] that's why a lot of times the decisions
[41:40] are made if a lot of things are done and
[41:42] and and
[41:43] you wonder why it's done
[41:45] well you don't know everything about
[41:46] what's going on but a pastor knows every
[41:49] little minute detail even though he's
[41:52] got discernment
[41:55] by from the lord and sometimes just
[41:57] common sense
[41:59] to see what's going on in the church and
[42:01] not have somebody to come up and confess
[42:03] everything that they're doing and and oh
[42:05] my heavens
[42:07] let's get out of here i will go home
[42:09] i don't i don't deal with this no i
[42:12] don't want to deal with this anymore
[42:14] but you know what it's part of the job
[42:17] and brother dale never shunned that job
[42:18] we got a lot of good pastors that never
[42:20] shunned that job they don't shun that
[42:21] job we've seen people run from it but
[42:24] not around here
[42:25] but if you preach the word of god like
[42:27] i'm gonna read here just a minute ago
[42:29] teaching places of man in the body and
[42:31] what does it do
[42:32] it settles the church
[42:35] so that's what it's done it's settled
[42:36] the church but now as settling the
[42:38] church now can we get too settled
[42:41] yeah we can build that nest
[42:44] and we can wiggle we can wiggle our tail
[42:46] in it
[42:48] and get real soft
[42:50] remember the eagle she puts all those
[42:52] beautiful feathers in that right at
[42:54] first because when you lay the egg you
[42:56] don't want the thorns to stick through
[42:57] the egg and kill the little chicken
[43:00] right but you wait till that little
[43:01] chick is our little eagle is hatched
[43:04] what's mama start doing
[43:06] she don't want you to stay in that nest
[43:07] all the time she wants you to learn to
[43:09] fly so she starts pulling them feathers
[43:10] out give you a little trial give you a
[43:13] little temptation
[43:15] give you a little sore spot
[43:18] and then what are you doing now you're
[43:20] doing this
[43:22] and then you're gonna fly away and
[43:23] that's what god wants us to do and what
[43:25] am i saying grow up
[43:27] we need to all grow up just a little bit
[43:29] more
[43:30] because that's what we're predestinated
[43:32] to and adoption is not babies
[43:35] adoption is for mature adults
[43:39] they'll be okay with that amen
[43:41] so let's go to ephesians one
[43:44] paul an apostle of jesus christ by the
[43:46] will of god
[43:47] to the saints which at ephesus
[43:49] to the faithful in christ jesus we're
[43:51] going to read here
[43:52] in ephesus and see what like we were
[43:54] talking about
[43:55] sunday
[43:58] this is our pre-this is our
[43:59] predestination this is our predetermined
[44:01] god saw somebody was going to come to it
[44:04] you just got to match that piece
[44:07] you've got to match that peace that god
[44:09] saw
[44:10] before the foundation of the world it's
[44:11] got to literally happen
[44:13] jesus was crucified in in the mind of
[44:15] god before the foundation world but
[44:17] there had to come a time 2 000 years ago
[44:19] that he literally went through this
[44:21] you know why because you weren't
[44:22] predestinated to just go from baby to an
[44:25] adult
[44:26] christian with no trials
[44:30] trials build character
[44:32] jesus went through trials and built
[44:33] character
[44:35] so don't think we're not going through
[44:36] them but look it's not it's not that
[44:38] we're not going to have them
[44:39] but we'll know how to handle them
[44:42] we know how to come out on the other end
[44:43] of victor
[44:45] amen
[44:46] not beat down we come back and we come
[44:48] out of this thing as a victor how many
[44:51] trials have you ever had that you just
[44:52] lost everything and it just it just
[44:54] stayed that way
[44:55] no way
[44:57] no way if you stayed in one battle for
[44:59] 20 years
[45:01] you ain't died or something happened i
[45:03] don't know what's going on
[45:05] you need to fight that one kill it and
[45:07] go to the next one
[45:08] that's what we talk about with with
[45:10] joshua joshua never lingered in one
[45:12] place they kept battling because he had
[45:14] to give this to this land he had to give
[45:16] this and that's what the ministry is
[45:17] doing now they're battling with you to
[45:20] get you this part because look
[45:22] i wrote myself a little note remember
[45:24] moses
[45:25] moses was the prophet
[45:27] moses was commissioned to what bring
[45:30] them out but not take them in
[45:34] bring them out with a strong hand
[45:37] all right so he brought them out in a
[45:38] prophetic ministry
[45:40] everybody with me brought him out in a
[45:42] prophetic ministry
[45:44] didn't place them
[45:46] but got them
[45:48] right at the land
[45:50] right on the border
[45:52] and then what happened
[45:53] god said okay you've done what i want
[45:55] you to do
[45:56] now i've got joshua a type of the holy
[45:59] ghost is one that's going to place you
[46:02] all right we've had a prophet in the end
[46:04] time
[46:06] i'm just telling you the way it is
[46:08] we've had a prophet in the end time he
[46:10] brought us to a place
[46:12] he brought us to where he showed us
[46:14] everything the seals everything was open
[46:17] and he could see the promised land
[46:22] but i believe he knew he wasn't going to
[46:23] make it all the way because he was
[46:24] prophesying all down through there and
[46:26] then all of a sudden 1965 he's gone
[46:31] that didn't just happen
[46:33] because
[46:34] it happened
[46:35] it had a purpose
[46:38] moses thy servant is dead
[46:41] but his ministry was not
[46:44] joshua was the fulfillment of moses's
[46:46] ministry
[46:48] you and i are the fulfillment of the
[46:50] prophet of the end times ministry
[46:53] the final voice to the final age will
[46:55] have to be the bride
[46:58] listen
[46:59] let's just get in let's just get into
[47:00] this nitty gritty brother branham
[47:05] was he brought us what back to the faith
[47:07] of the fathers he gave us the most
[47:09] beautiful foundation the zerubbabel to
[47:11] build on and he built it up but he built
[47:14] it in prophecy
[47:17] not reality
[47:20] he built it in prophecy there was nobody
[47:23] in the sixth seal i've been read that a
[47:24] hundred times to you you're not getting
[47:26] it it's not for you
[47:28] you're in this part right here
[47:31] get this and stay happy
[47:33] because there's a group coming over here
[47:36] that's gonna get it
[47:37] now there's no other group but you and i
[47:39] there's no other group but the bride of
[47:41] jesus christ matured in the end time
[47:44] that's going to take the seals you know
[47:46] i agree with some some of the brothers
[47:48] say that the seals are not open
[47:50] to a lot of people they're not
[47:54] they literally closed the book back up
[47:57] but remember god's the only one who can
[47:59] open a book
[48:00] god's only one who can close the book
[48:03] so he what do you do when you close a
[48:04] book you do what you blind them
[48:07] how many times the bible tells us that
[48:09] you've got eyes and can't see you got
[48:10] ears and can't hear you're blinded by
[48:13] what you're seeing
[48:15] i mean really that's you're being
[48:17] blinded by what you're looking at
[48:19] but you're not really seeing or getting
[48:22] the prophecy you're not getting what's
[48:24] behind all that
[48:27] um
[48:28] brother isaac sent me a
[48:30] uh
[48:31] marco polo the other day and
[48:33] we were discussing something earlier and
[48:35] he said
[48:36] he said brother you didn't even mention
[48:38] nothing about the seals
[48:40] as a joke
[48:43] so i sent him back i said
[48:45] i said no i was talking about him all
[48:46] the time i said you just didn't get the
[48:47] love letter
[48:49] you didn't get the in-between
[48:50] you didn't get the revelation i said you
[48:52] you were just reading on paper
[48:54] and that's what we're doing and that the
[48:56] bri the bride does not just read on
[48:58] paper
[49:00] joshua absolutely
[49:03] he acted on what moses brought
[49:09] he didn't change the ten commandments to
[49:11] ten suggestions
[49:14] amen he acted on that and took a people
[49:18] a group of people into the promised land
[49:21] had to circumcise several of them again
[49:25] you know i was thinking about that
[49:27] it's kind of funny it is
[49:30] it's only further in my notes but i'll
[49:31] tell you now
[49:33] it seemed like moses never had time to
[49:35] do anything
[49:39] wasn't brother brown about the same way
[49:41] he had a message to brain though he had
[49:44] a purpose
[49:45] sure he had family sure he had this but
[49:47] but here's moses
[49:49] listen he's the one that told the people
[49:52] from abraham
[49:53] to moses he said
[49:55] eighth day circumcise your kids
[50:01] he has circumcised one person
[50:04] i mean if he you know if he was supposed
[50:05] to be this bringing this commission
[50:08] and this whole group
[50:10] over here is going to have to be
[50:12] circumcised again they were standing
[50:14] there when moses was on top of that
[50:15] mountain getting ready to die or go
[50:17] wherever he was going
[50:19] and then moses getting ready to go to
[50:21] the to the to the uh to egypt
[50:24] didn't even circumcise his own kids
[50:29] there's a lot of things you put out
[50:31] there's a lot of things that the prophet
[50:32] to god
[50:33] we think man he was sure he was a great
[50:35] man
[50:36] but he he had to literally single
[50:38] himself out
[50:42] only see his wife two or three times a
[50:44] year sometimes
[50:46] how many sisters you put up with that
[50:48] well some of you could put up a lot but
[50:49] that's okay i'm sorry i didn't mean to
[50:51] go there
[50:53] some of you would be slap happy to do
[50:54] that
[50:56] but anyway some of you wouldn't jim
[50:58] wouldn't she doesn't shook her head no
[51:00] that's my baby
[51:03] but look what moses had to give up
[51:07] look what brother brown had to give up
[51:09] but now remember but look at joshua here
[51:11] joshua goes into the promised land he
[51:13] doesn't give up anything
[51:15] he knows what to do circumcise them
[51:18] people get them ready
[51:20] and then god gives him commission as i
[51:22] was with moses i'll be with you same
[51:25] thing with me and you tonight
[51:27] as i was with the prophet i'll be with
[51:28] you because if he was a prophet he told
[51:31] us we were prophetic people so we should
[51:34] understand the prophetic we should
[51:36] understand that that
[51:38] god sent us a prophet but he sent us a
[51:40] prophetic message through that prophet
[51:43] that prophet's gone off the scene but
[51:45] what he said
[51:46] joshua acted on what the prophet said
[51:51] you and i as the fivefold ministry
[51:53] should be acting on what the prophet
[51:55] said
[51:57] not a suggestion
[52:01] everybody all right
[52:05] paul an apostle of jesus christ by the
[52:06] will of god to the saints which is us at
[52:08] ephesus and remember
[52:11] ephesus was a
[52:13] grown group of people
[52:15] big old powerful church had a big great
[52:17] auditorium
[52:19] 12 people
[52:21] but they were all full of the holy ghost
[52:24] give me a church full of the holy ghost
[52:26] every person that walks in the door
[52:28] that's my prayer
[52:29] is that everybody gets the holy ghost
[52:32] not an anointing
[52:33] but against the real baptism of the holy
[52:35] ghost that's my prayer
[52:37] and to the faithful in christ jesus
[52:39] grace be to you and peace from god our
[52:40] father
[52:41] and from the lord jesus christ now watch
[52:43] what he's telling tell us now watch so
[52:46] this is this is prophetic
[52:48] look at verse three let's go to the next
[52:51] there you go in the mind of god before
[52:53] time we were doing this the other day so
[52:54] let's go through it again every time i
[52:56] say us you need to say us i know it's
[52:57] wednesday night you know we get a lot of
[52:59] volume out of you but please say us okay
[53:02] let's practice
[53:05] man that's good let's be the god father
[53:07] of our lord jesus christ who has blessed
[53:09] us with all spiritual blessings in
[53:10] heavenly places in christ so now when
[53:13] you get born again that sits you in a
[53:15] heavenly place
[53:17] oh brother i had nothing but trouble
[53:22] you're looking at circumstances
[53:24] your soul is god
[53:27] if you're born again your soul is
[53:29] almighty god you've just got it so
[53:33] encapsulated and so you've got that
[53:36] you've got that i watched them uh guys
[53:38] across the road they're making pots
[53:40] and they start with just a big old lump
[53:42] of clay and you know how that is and
[53:43] they start to wheel you know
[53:47] i think man that is that's art
[53:50] but that's what god did but you know
[53:51] what our problem is we close that sucker
[53:53] up
[53:55] we we don't let it out how have i been
[53:57] telling you let it out let what you got
[53:59] out
[54:00] our humanity gets in god's way more than
[54:03] anything
[54:05] amen
[54:06] so let's work on our humanity
[54:08] if that's one thing it gets in god's way
[54:10] let's work on it
[54:12] oh but brother we
[54:13] i'm i don't want to hear that anymore
[54:16] i'm telling you what the bible says who
[54:18] has blessed
[54:20] with all spiritual blessings and
[54:21] heavenly places in christ according as
[54:23] he has chosen
[54:25] in him before the foundation of the
[54:26] world that
[54:28] should be holy and without blame before
[54:29] him in love now that's what we're
[54:31] working on
[54:34] when you got born again your soul yes it
[54:35] was as holy as it'll ever be it never
[54:38] sinned
[54:39] never going to sin
[54:41] that's what we got to realize that thing
[54:43] that's inside of you is already sealed
[54:45] up
[54:46] it's already ready to go in a rapture
[54:50] your rapture started the day you got
[54:52] born again
[54:54] but the rest of you got to catch up
[54:58] because we were born in sand shaped and
[54:59] iniquity but see that's the plan and
[55:00] that's okay god that's all right
[55:03] god's got it all done it's all figured
[55:05] out
[55:07] it just takes our free moral agency
[55:09] to plug ourselves into that
[55:11] all right is everybody okay with that
[55:13] and it's not just like and i like what
[55:15] brother matthew said if you watch some
[55:16] preachers
[55:17] like brother matthew if you talk about
[55:19] the seed and you talk about these
[55:20] different things if they throw out three
[55:22] free moral agency
[55:24] get away from it
[55:26] but if they'll always come back to free
[55:28] moral agency
[55:29] that settles the whole deal that makes
[55:31] the doctrine correct
[55:33] when you take for it's your it's your
[55:35] choice
[55:36] i know god saw you before the foundation
[55:38] world i know you're sitting in heavenly
[55:39] places i'm reading it on the screen it's
[55:41] the bible
[55:43] but you gotta plug yourself into them
[55:46] amen
[55:47] that we should
[55:49] we
[55:50] should be holding without blame before
[55:51] him in love having predestinated
[55:53] unto the adoption of children by jesus
[55:55] christ to himself according to the good
[55:57] pleasure of his will which is his what
[55:59] word to the praise of the glory of his
[56:01] grace
[56:03] now look god don't need grace
[56:06] he is grace
[56:08] so what are you talking about it's not
[56:09] about us
[56:10] we need grace he's extending the grace
[56:12] to us we're in he hath
[56:15] accepted made
[56:15] the beloved which is jesus christ listen
[56:17] we're already accepted if you're born
[56:19] again tonight you're already accepted
[56:21] there's that wide foundation but look as
[56:24] we go up this statue of perfect man
[56:26] though look how it narrows
[56:28] it narrows because number one
[56:31] not everybody's gonna attain to it
[56:36] i'm just telling you sorry
[56:39] not everybody but whoever attains to it
[56:42] you've got to have a lot more faith than
[56:43] you do virtue
[56:45] a lot more faith than you do knowledge
[56:47] it all starts with faith
[56:52] because i'll read you this quote in just
[56:53] a second when i get finished with this
[56:55] so now
[56:56] that was all in the mind of god he
[56:58] accepted us before the foundation of the
[57:00] world he went to the cross and died to
[57:03] what to make sure that that would happen
[57:05] to make sure that you and i would be
[57:07] released that you and i would be to
[57:09] where we could make a choice
[57:13] now let's go to the next on earth here's
[57:16] redemption in whom
[57:18] that was totally weak in whom
[57:21] have redemption through his blood the
[57:23] forgiveness of sins according to the
[57:24] riches of whose grace his grace we're in
[57:26] he has a bounded toward
[57:29] in all wisdom and prudence now that's
[57:31] what that's growth
[57:33] you're heading into some growth here
[57:34] everybody with me
[57:36] having made known unto
[57:38] the mystery of his will
[57:42] wow
[57:43] according to his good pleasure which he
[57:45] has purpose in himself
[57:47] that's why that look that in the
[57:49] dispensation
[57:52] what is our dispensation now son of man
[57:56] that's our dispensation that in the
[57:57] dispensation of the fullness of times
[58:01] what right here at the end
[58:02] two thousand years
[58:05] listen redemption is fiction to be this
[58:07] plan of redemption for the gentiles is
[58:09] fixing to be over
[58:11] i mean totally over
[58:13] no more gentiles will be saved god will
[58:16] only go to the jews and he'll only save
[58:18] others at the white throne judgment
[58:20] under what they did and what they didn't
[58:23] do
[58:24] is everybody okay with that so this
[58:26] thing this plan that he started from the
[58:28] garden of eden
[58:30] literally i'm talking about literally
[58:31] from the garden of eden until until now
[58:33] is fixing to be culminated in a bride
[58:36] taking a body change
[58:38] and going up
[58:39] and god coming back to the jews
[58:41] everybody all right with that
[58:44] but we got some growing to do
[58:47] look that he might gather together
[58:49] in one
[58:50] all things in christ both which are in
[58:52] heaven and which are on earth
[58:55] even in him
[58:57] in whom also
[58:59] have obtained an inheritance you had to
[59:02] make a choice
[59:04] god knew your choice but you had to make
[59:06] a choice that's why that that that in in
[59:09] one page of a book brother brown says
[59:11] you were saved before the foundation of
[59:13] the world you weren't saved on any
[59:14] certain day and then five pages later he
[59:17] said your eternal life begins at the
[59:18] altar
[59:20] he's not confused
[59:23] that was done in the mind of god this is
[59:25] literally what's going to do you're
[59:27] going to receive it right here
[59:29] that's what me and brother bob was
[59:31] talking about you know you
[59:32] somebody tells you
[59:34] uh it's really
[59:35] you don't have to have a lot of
[59:36] discernment but
[59:38] they they say i got born again
[59:42] i got born again i know i got born again
[59:46] wake her up
[59:48] thank you
[59:50] you can't listen when i was close
[59:53] i got born again
[59:55] and you do the same thing you'd been
[59:57] doing
[59:59] you don't change
[1:00:02] groups that you hang around
[1:00:04] you don't change places that you go used
[1:00:07] to go to
[1:00:09] you didn't get born again
[1:00:11] no no no
[1:00:13] you did not get born again
[1:00:15] listen
[1:00:16] everybody that i see
[1:00:19] that i believe is born again
[1:00:22] you didn't bring your friends in this
[1:00:23] church
[1:00:26] did you hello
[1:00:29] no i'd be scared to death
[1:00:33] i'm sorry they would be scared to death
[1:00:36] for me to bring them into the church
[1:00:38] they would be scared why
[1:00:40] unfamiliar spirit
[1:00:43] you had an unfamiliar spirit when you
[1:00:45] were in the world that's why
[1:00:46] you didn't come into the church until
[1:00:48] god saved you
[1:00:50] right
[1:00:51] so if you're still doing the things you
[1:00:52] used to do and hang around with the same
[1:00:54] people you've been hanging around with
[1:00:56] you ain't get born again born again will
[1:00:58] separate you
[1:01:00] ask that black he's back there in the
[1:01:01] back you ask him
[1:01:05] your friends will automatically leave
[1:01:09] if they're not born again now if they're
[1:01:10] born again then that's okay you get
[1:01:12] together and we like we did and
[1:01:14] fellowship meeting or are you meeting
[1:01:16] this weekend
[1:01:17] you come together
[1:01:20] and you know you read the scripture says
[1:01:21] of light precious faith
[1:01:23] well you know what
[1:01:24] they get together just in like faith
[1:01:27] it ain't precious
[1:01:28] but what birds of a feather
[1:01:31] flock together
[1:01:32] so if you get born again it'll show
[1:01:35] prove it
[1:01:37] it will prove itself
[1:01:40] i'll agree
[1:01:42] it's hard young people
[1:01:45] i know it is i see the world out there
[1:01:49] but god's greater than anything the
[1:01:50] world's god
[1:01:52] his spirit is holy
[1:01:55] his spirit is stronger than any other
[1:01:57] spirit that's out there in the world
[1:01:59] so if you get the holy ghost yeah you're
[1:02:01] going to have problems but you're going
[1:02:02] to have you're going to learn that you
[1:02:04] can deal with them and you'll know where
[1:02:05] to go to get answers
[1:02:07] that's the problem with the world out
[1:02:08] here today they do not know where to go
[1:02:10] get an answer they watch this program
[1:02:12] and they watch this one they watch this
[1:02:14] program and they watch this one and none
[1:02:16] of them coincide with each other
[1:02:18] right
[1:02:20] thank god
[1:02:21] for the continuity of god's word
[1:02:24] that it can come together and you get
[1:02:25] the same answer
[1:02:27] every time
[1:02:31] having made it known unto us the mystery
[1:02:34] of his will according to his good
[1:02:36] pleasure which he has purpose in himself
[1:02:38] that in the dispensation of the fullness
[1:02:40] of time he might gather together
[1:02:44] not separate
[1:02:47] gather together
[1:02:50] in one
[1:02:53] not in 20
[1:02:55] not in 13 000 different denominations
[1:02:58] in the message
[1:03:02] sorry
[1:03:05] you know
[1:03:07] there's a lot of times
[1:03:11] that when jesus was walking on the earth
[1:03:13] i'm gonna try to pick my words right
[1:03:14] here i get in trouble for no
[1:03:18] there's a lot of times that jesus put up
[1:03:20] with stuff
[1:03:23] paul did
[1:03:24] paul put up with that woman that
[1:03:25] followed him around for all them all
[1:03:27] them days
[1:03:29] aggravating him and then all the tanner
[1:03:31] and all the different ones that paul put
[1:03:33] up with but one day
[1:03:35] he turned around and he said you vile
[1:03:38] spirit
[1:03:39] i've heard enough of you remember one of
[1:03:40] them he struck him dumb
[1:03:42] where he couldn't say another word so he
[1:03:44] made sure that guy shut up
[1:03:48] what am i saying jesus did the same
[1:03:50] thing
[1:03:51] brother brown did the same thing
[1:03:53] i don't say he compromised with the with
[1:03:55] the denominations never
[1:03:57] but he dealt with them
[1:04:00] in their time
[1:04:01] but when he come to the seals and when
[1:04:03] he come to marriage in divorce
[1:04:05] he said hundreds i think one place he
[1:04:07] said thousands of my friends are going
[1:04:09] to leave me why that's the son of man
[1:04:11] ministry
[1:04:14] jesus put up with him pharisees until
[1:04:15] the very end
[1:04:18] and he finally said you of your father
[1:04:20] the devil
[1:04:23] i've got a different daddy than you do
[1:04:27] religious world he didn't say that to
[1:04:29] the prostitute
[1:04:30] he didn't say that to somebody else he
[1:04:33] said that to the religious world
[1:04:36] the son of man listen the son of man
[1:04:38] ministry will not compromise
[1:04:43] oh well maybe they uh
[1:04:45] if it don't ring
[1:04:47] if it don't that bell don't ring
[1:04:51] it ain't
[1:04:52] true one word off today folks one word
[1:04:56] off that's why some people feel we're
[1:04:58] too adamant about what we believe you
[1:05:00] know what the world's adamant about what
[1:05:02] they believe
[1:05:04] why can't we be adamant of what we
[1:05:05] believe
[1:05:06] amen clap your hands you clap on
[1:05:08] everything else
[1:05:14] because jesus stood alone
[1:05:17] by himself
[1:05:18] even his disciples didn't understand him
[1:05:21] because he didn't have the holy ghost
[1:05:22] but once they got the holy ghost on the
[1:05:23] day of pentecost they're like
[1:05:25] we know what he's talking about
[1:05:27] we know why he did what he did because
[1:05:29] you know what peter and them did the
[1:05:31] same thing they stand up in the temple
[1:05:32] and they're preaching jesus christ they
[1:05:34] get thrown in jail
[1:05:36] by who the sinners know
[1:05:40] by catholicism
[1:05:42] by all the different religious people
[1:05:45] and you know what
[1:05:48] most of them were living under the law
[1:05:50] blameless
[1:05:55] paul said
[1:05:57] in the book of acts
[1:05:59] he said a pharisee of the pharisees
[1:06:02] blameless according to the law
[1:06:04] but he was having christians killed
[1:06:08] because he didn't move his ministry up
[1:06:11] to where he's supposed to be
[1:06:13] that's our problem
[1:06:16] we talking about by the way we're going
[1:06:18] to get into positionally placed and we
[1:06:19] want to positionally place you got to
[1:06:21] know where to go
[1:06:23] you got to know you're not in that place
[1:06:24] or you got to know you are in that place
[1:06:26] jesus knew where he was at brother brown
[1:06:28] said jesus knew where he was he was in a
[1:06:30] world of faith he knew where he was at
[1:06:31] at every moment
[1:06:33] now sometimes we do and sometimes we
[1:06:35] don't
[1:06:36] sometimes we go what in the world are we
[1:06:38] doing here
[1:06:42] but if you're a child of god
[1:06:46] you're right where you're supposed to be
[1:06:48] if you yield to that
[1:06:52] and we'll get into that way later or
[1:06:54] later on
[1:06:55] in the the you take manassas and and all
[1:06:58] those different ones and as long as they
[1:07:00] stayed in their position
[1:07:02] they were okay
[1:07:05] but when one wanted to move somewhere
[1:07:07] into this one because this one looked
[1:07:08] better than the other one it's got this
[1:07:09] one got more property than i got this
[1:07:11] one's got a better this than i got this
[1:07:13] one got a better that they started
[1:07:15] problem
[1:07:16] listen they started fighting each other
[1:07:19] in the promised land
[1:07:25] think about
[1:07:26] that
[1:07:28] they started fighting each other after
[1:07:30] joshua had already placed them where
[1:07:31] they supposed to go of course that was a
[1:07:33] natural story but it's also a spiritual
[1:07:34] story also
[1:07:36] everybody okay
[1:07:38] then in a dispensation of the fullness
[1:07:40] of time he might gather together in one
[1:07:42] all things in christ both which are in
[1:07:44] heaven which on earth even in him and
[1:07:45] whom also
[1:07:47] we've have obtained an inheritance
[1:07:50] being predestinated by the mind of god
[1:07:53] according to the purpose of him who
[1:07:55] worketh all things after the council of
[1:07:56] his own will which is his
[1:07:58] that
[1:08:00] should be to the praise of his glory who
[1:08:03] first trusted in christ in whom
[1:08:05] you say we also trusted after that
[1:08:10] we heard the word of truth after
[1:08:13] everybody wants to be on top of the
[1:08:15] ladder without listening to the word
[1:08:20] or doing what he said
[1:08:22] the gospel of your salvation and him
[1:08:25] also after that
[1:08:27] we believed
[1:08:28] you were sealed with that holy spirit of
[1:08:30] the promise you were sealed
[1:08:32] with that holy spirit of promise now
[1:08:34] that's the foundation that's where
[1:08:36] that's just where you start growing when
[1:08:38] you get sealed in with god
[1:08:40] that's when you start growing
[1:08:42] everybody okay with that
[1:08:44] that's when you get started on your
[1:08:46] journey that's your foundation brother
[1:08:48] branham many many times i read you a few
[1:08:50] quotes where brother brown said that's
[1:08:52] where you pentecostals fail
[1:08:54] you get into the land you get right
[1:08:56] there at the border in the land and you
[1:08:58] think this is it
[1:09:00] brother brown said no you're just
[1:09:01] getting started
[1:09:03] why they needed character
[1:09:05] listen folks
[1:09:08] i'm going to say this with with
[1:09:10] reverence of all the people that we've
[1:09:11] known from 2 000 years backwards
[1:09:16] there's nobody projected
[1:09:19] the the character of the son of man
[1:09:22] like jesus
[1:09:24] and like william branham
[1:09:26] and now it's got to be like the bride
[1:09:31] it's great listen
[1:09:32] it's great for us to see
[1:09:36] i know i don't i don't want to call them
[1:09:37] relics
[1:09:38] but there's things that people worship
[1:09:40] that are back there
[1:09:42] aaron quit laughing they're they're back
[1:09:45] there
[1:09:47] what about here
[1:09:49] listen i just as soon have a prayer
[1:09:52] cloth
[1:09:53] from donny's billfold
[1:09:56] then i had one that brother branham laid
[1:09:57] over and prayed over
[1:10:00] i know we want to hold that deer we want
[1:10:02] to hold to that
[1:10:04] but my lord that's moses
[1:10:08] where's my joshua
[1:10:10] where's my joshua that's going to place
[1:10:12] me in a land that's going to help me
[1:10:14] fight my battles
[1:10:17] where is that at
[1:10:20] listen
[1:10:21] when elijah went up
[1:10:26] right
[1:10:29] he's the type of brother branham because
[1:10:31] he was the third elijah
[1:10:33] or the second elijah
[1:10:35] first elijah and number two was standing
[1:10:37] together but brother brown said elisha
[1:10:39] topped the bride right
[1:10:42] so elisha grabs the mantle of elijah and
[1:10:46] starts running after him and trying to
[1:10:47] find him
[1:10:50] no
[1:10:51] no
[1:10:53] he's got the mantle
[1:10:56] he goes to the same river they just
[1:10:59] crossed
[1:11:02] and hit that river with that same
[1:11:04] anointing and said where
[1:11:06] be the god of elijah
[1:11:09] he wasn't asking he was telling the
[1:11:12] world
[1:11:13] that right here is the same god
[1:11:16] oh elijah they went he went up and he
[1:11:19] was in a chariot and oh you ought to see
[1:11:22] he never said that
[1:11:26] elisha never stood there for
[1:11:28] 60 years
[1:11:32] help me somebody
[1:11:33] they just he didn't stand there for 60
[1:11:35] years and go well i wish he'd come back
[1:11:38] i i i saw it
[1:11:41] but i wish he'd come back
[1:11:43] no
[1:11:44] that joker grabbed that mantle and he
[1:11:46] went back across the river
[1:11:48] and he went over and did twice as many
[1:11:50] miracles as elijah done
[1:11:53] so i say tonight where be the god of
[1:11:55] elijah
[1:11:56] he's in his bride
[1:11:58] he's not a relic
[1:12:00] he's not something that we have to lean
[1:12:02] on to make sure we get a
[1:12:05] here i go to make sure i get a lure that
[1:12:07] looks like one that brother branham
[1:12:12] yeah that's an ouchie
[1:12:14] but it happened
[1:12:16] if y'all didn't know that it did
[1:12:20] that's okay but man
[1:12:24] that ain't real to me
[1:12:26] i wasn't there
[1:12:28] when that happened
[1:12:31] i'm gonna get in trouble with this
[1:12:35] but where are we going to see that you
[1:12:37] and i
[1:12:40] it's great that brother brown came to
[1:12:41] adoption it's great that all these
[1:12:43] things happen
[1:12:45] honestly
[1:12:46] but but i've heard people say that
[1:12:48] they'd rather listen you know there was
[1:12:49] a
[1:12:50] um
[1:12:51] there was a tape came out that
[1:12:53] jeffersonville well
[1:12:55] they put out
[1:12:56] they just had prayer lines
[1:12:59] that's okay
[1:13:01] that kind of gets you
[1:13:03] motivated kind of gets you faith build
[1:13:05] up a little bit
[1:13:07] but there's no growth in that
[1:13:10] there's no growth in that
[1:13:12] i gotta hear the word that was in before
[1:13:15] that
[1:13:16] because listen if i can preach come on
[1:13:18] somebody if i can preach the same
[1:13:20] message he's preaching
[1:13:22] then i'm going to expect the same result
[1:13:24] in this prayer line i'm going to accept
[1:13:26] what happens now
[1:13:29] if i preach the same message
[1:13:32] where be the god of elijah amen
[1:13:36] he's right here
[1:13:39] you we you us they us brad
[1:13:44] not to the world
[1:13:48] i'm losing my voice
[1:13:51] but that's what we're looking at folks
[1:13:53] we're looking at this
[1:13:56] updated revelation
[1:14:00] and if people want to think that we're
[1:14:02] different
[1:14:03] please do
[1:14:06] amen
[1:14:08] he was different the world hated him
[1:14:10] and he was god almighty and human flesh
[1:14:13] fulfilled every characteristics of that
[1:14:15] statue of perfect man
[1:14:18] every one of them you say brotherly
[1:14:19] kindness yeah he loved him pharisees
[1:14:23] if they were to listen to what he said
[1:14:26] but they weren't supposed to
[1:14:29] he came to the most religious remember
[1:14:32] was um
[1:14:34] there they crucified him
[1:14:36] there
[1:14:37] the most holy city in the world
[1:14:40] jerusalem those were god's people
[1:14:44] they weren't heathens
[1:14:46] they were god's people
[1:14:48] because god said
[1:14:49] you're my people
[1:14:52] there they who
[1:14:53] the most religious people in the world
[1:14:56] were right there in jerusalem
[1:14:58] listen they didn't have the internet
[1:14:59] back then
[1:15:02] nope word of mouth
[1:15:05] crucified
[1:15:07] god
[1:15:09] in the most holy place
[1:15:11] brother braham said that is what's
[1:15:12] happening again
[1:15:16] that is what's happening again
[1:15:20] i'm like paul
[1:15:22] in a way that's called heresy
[1:15:26] please think i'm crazy
[1:15:28] please
[1:15:30] call me different
[1:15:34] when it's according to god
[1:15:37] brother brown said you're going to be
[1:15:38] odd anyway he said don't be odd you're
[1:15:40] going to be on anyway
[1:15:41] if you'd be a christian an oddball
[1:15:44] didn't he preaching oddball i'm sure he
[1:15:45] did
[1:15:47] all right look let's go to the next one
[1:15:48] we're not going to get done
[1:15:50] but we'll get a certain spot and we'll
[1:15:51] stop
[1:15:53] so now look which is the earnest of
[1:15:56] earnest
[1:15:57] now look
[1:15:59] you got a house
[1:16:03] you go and sit down with a lawyer
[1:16:07] if you like most of us you're poor and
[1:16:08] ain't got the money to pay for the whole
[1:16:10] thing at one time
[1:16:12] you know what we're supporting sin the
[1:16:14] same thing we couldn't pay for it all at
[1:16:15] one time
[1:16:18] but he could
[1:16:19] he paid for it all at one time
[1:16:22] but you and i can't but you know what he
[1:16:24] give us a down payment
[1:16:27] but remember
[1:16:28] we are the ones that give the bank the
[1:16:30] down payment
[1:16:33] the bank of heaven
[1:16:35] give them a down payment then as long as
[1:16:36] you make the payments you know what that
[1:16:38] that title may not be all in your name
[1:16:41] but if you if you meet all the
[1:16:43] requirements
[1:16:46] meet all the requirements
[1:16:48] of the payment book
[1:16:51] at the end of the 30 years or whatever
[1:16:53] you got the loan for
[1:16:55] your name
[1:16:56] goes on that title
[1:16:58] and there's nobody can take it away from
[1:17:00] you
[1:17:02] but before that you goof up
[1:17:05] guess what
[1:17:06] free moral agency takes over
[1:17:09] god takes his house back
[1:17:13] now don't take his he don't take the new
[1:17:15] birth back but he anything you need to
[1:17:18] go up that statue of a perfect man if
[1:17:19] you stop it then god's going to say okay
[1:17:23] i can't make you make the payment
[1:17:25] that's right you choose this day who
[1:17:26] you'll serve choose this day if you'll
[1:17:28] make a payment or not but you get the
[1:17:30] earnest
[1:17:31] when you get the new birth
[1:17:34] until what the redemption of the
[1:17:35] purchased possession what did he what
[1:17:37] did he possess at calvary
[1:17:39] body spirit and soul
[1:17:41] not just your soul
[1:17:43] he claimed it all
[1:17:44] unto the praise
[1:17:46] of his glory
[1:17:48] everybody all right with that
[1:17:49] so let's go to number one look
[1:17:52] he said now preaching usually catches
[1:17:54] the center brings him under condemnation
[1:17:55] by the word but teaching places a man
[1:17:58] positionally what he is
[1:18:00] and we can never rightly be able to have
[1:18:02] faith watch
[1:18:04] let me let me not
[1:18:06] let me interpolate like paul did i don't
[1:18:09] get in trouble if i interpolate but if i
[1:18:10] stick it in there myself they say that
[1:18:12] you're not saying what brother brown
[1:18:13] said kind of like claude said you can
[1:18:16] you can misquote the bible
[1:18:18] or paraphrase the bible and people go
[1:18:20] it's okay he just didn't he just didn't
[1:18:22] know the whole scripture but you
[1:18:23] misquote a quote
[1:18:25] yeah that's when the phone starts
[1:18:26] ringing
[1:18:27] but teaching places a man positionally
[1:18:30] what he is people are funny
[1:18:32] and we can never rightly be able to have
[1:18:34] faith
[1:18:36] rapturing
[1:18:38] faith
[1:18:41] you get faith in your birth
[1:18:43] but he's talking about positionally
[1:18:44] placing
[1:18:45] so i want to put that right there have
[1:18:47] rapturing faith
[1:18:49] until positionally
[1:18:51] you know what you are
[1:18:54] i mean how in the world
[1:18:56] are we gonna know where we are
[1:18:58] if we don't know where we are
[1:19:01] i mean that's kind of
[1:19:02] crazy but
[1:19:04] we're we're christians
[1:19:06] yeah okay you can be baby christians
[1:19:13] but will you decide
[1:19:17] to go higher
[1:19:19] to get more
[1:19:20] let's go to number two real quick
[1:19:24] now what is adoption so let me get this
[1:19:26] now i don't know whether i have time to
[1:19:27] get through this if there's a question
[1:19:29] you can ask me a little bit later your
[1:19:31] adoption is not your birth now we've
[1:19:32] already been through that we've
[1:19:33] separated it and we're going to do a
[1:19:34] little bit more
[1:19:35] tonight your adoption is not your birth
[1:19:38] because the children of israel
[1:19:41] became the children of israel when god
[1:19:43] said you're my children
[1:19:46] knowing they weren't going to do
[1:19:48] anything he said they took them through
[1:19:50] he took them through the wilderness
[1:19:51] brought them out with all those mighty
[1:19:53] miracles
[1:19:56] and they hated him
[1:19:58] we loathe this bread that we get every
[1:20:00] day that's fresh and
[1:20:02] good why have you brought us out here to
[1:20:05] die
[1:20:07] we'd rather have leeks and garlic back
[1:20:09] in you see what i'm talking about how
[1:20:10] people are
[1:20:12] i'd rather have this back to what we
[1:20:14] were doing look god don't go back
[1:20:19] i remember brother dale a long time ago
[1:20:20] preaching on the you know the israel sin
[1:20:22] what was it ten times in the wilderness
[1:20:25] god never said he never said
[1:20:28] he never gave him a spanking
[1:20:30] as soon as they would see him he'd say
[1:20:31] okay when you get in the promised lands
[1:20:33] he's just talking he's just talking
[1:20:34] right over that group of people
[1:20:37] same way with us down through the 2000
[1:20:38] years he's put up with father son holy
[1:20:40] ghost baptism he's put up with a trinity
[1:20:43] doctrine he's put up with these things
[1:20:44] but there was a time when he said i've
[1:20:46] had enough of this
[1:20:47] my word says this is what you do and you
[1:20:50] need to start doing it
[1:20:51] same way that's why brother brown had to
[1:20:53] come that's why god had to send a
[1:20:54] prophet he sent a prophet to bring us a
[1:20:56] positive message that says this is it
[1:20:58] there is no other
[1:21:04] no compromise
[1:21:07] sorry
[1:21:08] did god compromise
[1:21:10] oh well that's okay
[1:21:13] i'm gonna save you anyhow no
[1:21:16] he's gonna save you because you wanted
[1:21:17] to be saved you're gonna have to act
[1:21:18] right
[1:21:19] you're gonna have to what approach him
[1:21:21] right
[1:21:22] approach him with an honest and a
[1:21:23] contrite heart approach him with a
[1:21:24] broken heart
[1:21:26] and then god will save you
[1:21:29] but your adoption is your placing
[1:21:31] that's what we're going to get into a
[1:21:32] little bit later
[1:21:33] not now
[1:21:34] when you were born again john 1 17 i
[1:21:37] believe when you're born again of the
[1:21:38] spirit of god you're the sons of god but
[1:21:40] we were predestinated now what brother
[1:21:42] brown said he said all right you were
[1:21:43] sons of god you received the new birth
[1:21:45] but
[1:21:47] he's referring to we were predestinated
[1:21:49] unto adoption
[1:21:51] all right
[1:21:52] we are sons of god but we are production
[1:21:53] now here's what i'm trying to get to you
[1:21:55] for the sons of the last day
[1:21:57] who that
[1:21:59] that's us
[1:22:01] to see we were predestinated unto
[1:22:03] adoption
[1:22:04] that's going down a little further but
[1:22:06] yet that ain't what i'm talking about
[1:22:08] he's talking about the pentecostals i
[1:22:09] got the holy ghost listen the true holy
[1:22:11] ghost fell on the pentecostal people
[1:22:14] they will be there as bride
[1:22:19] but they're they were not called to a
[1:22:23] because god knew they would only take it
[1:22:25] so far and stop
[1:22:28] martin luther took it so far not him but
[1:22:30] the people took it so far and stopped
[1:22:35] that's why folks
[1:22:36] we can't stop
[1:22:40] we cannot stop
[1:22:42] it's got to be fresh
[1:22:44] it's got to be a fresh revelation it's
[1:22:46] got to be something that every day that
[1:22:47] we don't loathe coming to church
[1:22:50] we don't loathe having to
[1:22:52] listen to a tape
[1:22:54] we don't load this light bread god
[1:22:58] we literally enjoy it
[1:23:00] give me some more
[1:23:03] but remember when he got into promised
[1:23:04] land what happened that man has ceased
[1:23:08] and they ate of the old corn of the land
[1:23:09] they ate what had already been grown up
[1:23:11] that had already been given to them
[1:23:14] listen
[1:23:16] don't get in trouble again
[1:23:17] you can't really eat the old corn of the
[1:23:19] land
[1:23:21] number one not be born again because
[1:23:22] remember they eat it in the promised
[1:23:24] land
[1:23:24] so that's your position it's coming to a
[1:23:26] position where you're going to be
[1:23:27] positionally placed but without the
[1:23:28] message of the hour through a five-fold
[1:23:30] ministry
[1:23:32] that's the old corn of the land
[1:23:35] the manna is anything it drops on
[1:23:37] everybody
[1:23:41] the manna dropped on two million
[1:23:43] israelites that 99 of them were not
[1:23:47] going to make it to the promised land
[1:23:50] right
[1:23:52] joshua and caleb and the ones under 20
[1:23:54] years old they were able to eat of the
[1:23:56] old corn of the land
[1:23:58] because the manna had ceased once they
[1:24:01] walked into the
[1:24:02] promised land
[1:24:05] god will spoon feed you for so long
[1:24:08] then he's going to say now you got to go
[1:24:09] out there in that field and get it for
[1:24:10] yourself
[1:24:11] amen
[1:24:12] but your adoption is your placing
[1:24:15] everybody got that
[1:24:17] but yet that ain't what i'm talking
[1:24:18] about see you were predestinated into
[1:24:20] adoption adoption is placing a son
[1:24:23] and we'll read that in just a few
[1:24:24] minutes
[1:24:26] all right let's go to the first stage of
[1:24:27] adoption we already talked about this
[1:24:28] but we'll fly through it pretty quick
[1:24:31] because in romans 8 verse 14 through 17
[1:24:34] we see where paul is talking about for
[1:24:35] as many as are led by the spirit of god
[1:24:37] they are the sons of god listen you
[1:24:39] can't be the son of a devil and be born
[1:24:41] again
[1:24:42] you can't be the son of the devil and be
[1:24:43] adopted
[1:24:45] you got to be a son of god you got to be
[1:24:46] a daughter of god so that's where you
[1:24:48] start remember
[1:24:51] brother branham said and we make it to
[1:24:53] it may not that when those hebrew
[1:24:56] women had the babies which was the 12
[1:24:59] tribes
[1:25:00] you know when when the bible talks about
[1:25:02] the children of israel do you know what
[1:25:03] they're talking about
[1:25:05] they're talking about everybody because
[1:25:06] not all israel's israel
[1:25:08] the children of jacob
[1:25:12] hello
[1:25:14] because jacob's name was changed to
[1:25:16] israel
[1:25:17] so it's the children of jacob which was
[1:25:20] reuben gad manasseh all the way down and
[1:25:22] remember leah had some i'm not gonna
[1:25:24] break it down leah had some of them
[1:25:26] rachel had two
[1:25:28] right
[1:25:29] which was uh
[1:25:31] reuben i mean um
[1:25:33] joseph and thank you joseph and benjamin
[1:25:35] all right then you had concubines
[1:25:40] my lord
[1:25:41] that that had these children of israel
[1:25:44] that was named the 12 tribes so that's
[1:25:46] what god's talking about it's talking
[1:25:47] about the children of israel those 12
[1:25:49] tribes
[1:25:50] listen when they went into that promised
[1:25:51] land
[1:25:53] the mixed multitude had died
[1:25:56] see when they all came out of egypt if
[1:25:58] you'll watch the the ten commandments
[1:26:00] the movie
[1:26:01] the one from whatever in 1930 something
[1:26:03] that brother brown said you know you
[1:26:04] could go watch
[1:26:05] whatever it was
[1:26:07] charlton heston
[1:26:10] moses you're as old as he is
[1:26:13] so anyway
[1:26:14] uh
[1:26:15] but you see that that nathan and cora
[1:26:18] all the different ones they were mixed
[1:26:20] multitudes they came out with them you
[1:26:21] just see this whole herd coming out that
[1:26:23] wasn't all the children of israel
[1:26:25] because you always got that group that
[1:26:26] says i think i'll just kind of
[1:26:30] i think i'll just kind of follow along
[1:26:32] with them you know
[1:26:33] if something good happens to them then
[1:26:34] something good gonna happen to me
[1:26:37] that ain't what's gonna happen
[1:26:39] because god don't have that remember
[1:26:40] he's not a compromiser
[1:26:43] he swallowed about two hundred and
[1:26:44] something of them one day
[1:26:47] and accused moses of killing the people
[1:26:49] of god they weren't the people of god
[1:26:54] the ones that went in that hole were not
[1:26:58] because it was dathan and core a bunch
[1:27:00] read about them in the bible
[1:27:04] what we got a lot of now got a lot of
[1:27:05] death in the car hanging around
[1:27:08] sorry
[1:27:10] listen you hang around this message you
[1:27:13] die
[1:27:14] spiritually and naturally because you're
[1:27:16] not going to take a rapture
[1:27:20] how many people stood at the door of the
[1:27:22] ark
[1:27:25] if it was as many people then as they
[1:27:26] are now there was a spectacle
[1:27:29] so there was thousands of people around
[1:27:31] that ark all the time i believe
[1:27:34] just kind of waiting on
[1:27:38] let's see if what he preaches is true
[1:27:41] but remember who shut the door
[1:27:44] noah didn't want to shut the door
[1:27:46] god shut the door he said i've had
[1:27:48] enough
[1:27:50] and i'll promise you folks they were
[1:27:52] claw marks on those doors
[1:27:54] on the outside of the ark
[1:27:56] when that thing started hitting
[1:27:58] water but the hebrew children
[1:28:02] as they were birthed
[1:28:04] now remember
[1:28:05] hold on they were birthed over here
[1:28:08] everybody with me
[1:28:09] we'll just stop right here because i'm
[1:28:10] not going to get any further
[1:28:12] and it's only eight it's 8 25.
[1:28:15] all right you got the children of israel
[1:28:16] that were the children of jacob sorry
[1:28:18] let's start with the children of jacob
[1:28:19] now they weren't in the promised land
[1:28:21] they were running around all over the
[1:28:23] place
[1:28:24] remember you had
[1:28:25] you had
[1:28:26] abraham then you had
[1:28:30] isaac
[1:28:31] and jacob
[1:28:32] let me get it right abraham isaac and
[1:28:34] jacob
[1:28:35] jacob that's who we talking about jacob
[1:28:37] because jacob's name was turned to what
[1:28:39] israel
[1:28:41] so they started having babies over here
[1:28:44] well now then somewhere down the line
[1:28:48] a pharaoh raised up that didn't know
[1:28:50] joseph
[1:28:51] and they got put into captivity for 400
[1:28:53] and something years
[1:28:56] right
[1:28:58] then
[1:28:58] when god took him out with a mighty hand
[1:29:01] they were 40 more years in the
[1:29:02] wilderness
[1:29:05] you see your journey
[1:29:07] see you get born again right here
[1:29:12] the prophet of god said and there's only
[1:29:14] one there's only one man could say that
[1:29:16] brother william marion branham he said
[1:29:19] they screamed
[1:29:21] the names of the children and that's
[1:29:23] what positionally placed them in the
[1:29:24] land
[1:29:27] not that group
[1:29:29] their descendants
[1:29:31] it was 400 and almost 500 years
[1:29:36] god waited 500 years
[1:29:39] to complete the promise of placing
[1:29:43] those children in the promised land
[1:29:45] they stayed tribes
[1:29:47] they stayed in the message
[1:29:49] they listened to moses
[1:29:56] then moses leaves
[1:29:59] joshua takes over
[1:30:02] and puts some positionally places
[1:30:04] them prophetically 500 years they were
[1:30:07] spoken where they were going to be
[1:30:09] by the by the hebrew women let me read
[1:30:12] that real quick just so you
[1:30:14] know i'm not crazy i mean you know i'm
[1:30:16] crazy but still
[1:30:20] y'all didn't have to life
[1:30:22] hurt my feelings
[1:30:24] anyway
[1:30:28] quote number eight
[1:30:29] return and jubilee
[1:30:31] now we find that when joshua divided the
[1:30:33] inheritance to the people brothers
[1:30:35] that's way on down the line that's
[1:30:36] almost the last quote
[1:30:38] when joshua divided the inheritance to
[1:30:40] the people each person was placed
[1:30:42] positionally exactly the way these
[1:30:44] hebrew mothers named those children how
[1:30:47] they were placed in palestine just at
[1:30:49] their place
[1:30:52] asher gad naptali and each one judah
[1:30:55] everyone just placed in their position
[1:30:56] now
[1:30:57] when they were born
[1:31:00] by the hebrew mothers they screamed
[1:31:02] their name
[1:31:03] and that placed them
[1:31:05] so see that's why you and i are all
[1:31:07] predestinated to adoption
[1:31:10] everybody that gets the new birth
[1:31:12] you get born again
[1:31:15] you can come to adoption
[1:31:19] but what kept them from coming right
[1:31:21] then
[1:31:22] they did
[1:31:24] they did
[1:31:27] they wandered for 40 years because of
[1:31:29] who moses no joshua no caleb no
[1:31:33] they listened to 10 lion preachers
[1:31:38] that said in message churches
[1:31:41] saw the glory of god
[1:31:43] could have preached the glory of god
[1:31:46] but they listened to 10 people
[1:31:48] that told them a lie
[1:31:50] rather than listening to two people
[1:31:53] who told them the truth
[1:31:56] guess what god wiped them off
[1:32:01] he even killed those 10 preachers or 10
[1:32:04] 10 uh spies or whatever you want to call
[1:32:06] them but they were liars they lied to
[1:32:08] the people
[1:32:09] and the people that rather believe a lie
[1:32:11] i guess than to believe the truth
[1:32:13] but what was joshua and caleb looking at
[1:32:16] they weren't looking at circumstances
[1:32:18] they were looking at the promise
[1:32:20] they had faith that god would deliver
[1:32:22] all of them
[1:32:25] you know joshua was one of the greatest
[1:32:27] military leaders it ever was
[1:32:29] if it hadn't been for aiken
[1:32:32] how many people did he lose
[1:32:35] hero
[1:32:37] brother brown said no red cross
[1:32:41] right
[1:32:42] no uh you know they have no hospitals
[1:32:46] unless aiken did what did what he did
[1:32:48] unless sin gets in the camp
[1:32:51] god's gonna accomplish everything he
[1:32:52] said he's gonna accomplish but despite
[1:32:55] that
[1:32:56] he still accomplished everything he was
[1:32:58] going to accomplish
[1:32:59] he just had to get rid of aiken
[1:33:02] and you know what it wasn't just bacon
[1:33:04] that died
[1:33:06] his whole family died
[1:33:09] burn them in the tent
[1:33:12] where the wedge was and the garment was
[1:33:16] let's don't get that way
[1:33:19] but we'll look
[1:33:21] what a wonderful picture it gets us
[1:33:22] because it's a type of god placing in
[1:33:24] the church
[1:33:26] listen himself every member every stone
[1:33:29] every place every christian to itself
[1:33:33] each one of us has in our particular way
[1:33:37] has a place in the house of god
[1:33:41] wow
[1:33:42] like solomon's temple when it was cut
[1:33:43] out from all the world you remember what
[1:33:45] happened with the solomon's temple
[1:33:48] not a sound of a hammer
[1:33:51] if brother joel canada was here
[1:33:53] there's david said but good to see you
[1:33:55] hey buddy and and josiah is it like real
[1:33:58] quiet when y'all are building a house i
[1:34:01] mean you can't hear nothing
[1:34:02] no because what's going on
[1:34:04] you shrug your solid your hat well you
[1:34:07] don't hammer anymore you pop
[1:34:10] but it's a kind of a noisy place in
[1:34:12] there
[1:34:13] not when god's temple was built
[1:34:17] they cut it in another country
[1:34:20] another country
[1:34:22] and had it shipped to israel or to
[1:34:25] jerusalem
[1:34:26] and it just all
[1:34:28] fit
[1:34:29] together
[1:34:32] it all
[1:34:34] fit together
[1:34:37] without the noise of grumbling
[1:34:40] and complaining
[1:34:41] and this don't go here and that don't go
[1:34:44] there
[1:34:45] and i'm preaching it this way i don't
[1:34:46] care what you say i'm preaching it that
[1:34:48] way i
[1:34:52] if it was done then
[1:34:55] you say that we can't all agree i
[1:34:57] disagree
[1:35:03] i really didn't mean to say that but it
[1:35:04] sounds pretty good
[1:35:10] this son of man ministry listen jesus
[1:35:12] never fought against himself
[1:35:16] he never took a message back that he
[1:35:18] preached
[1:35:22] and he called the people that were one
[1:35:24] word off
[1:35:26] the
[1:35:26] devil snakes
[1:35:30] vipers
[1:35:33] oh by the way you're too militant now
[1:35:43] adam wasn't militant enough
[1:35:49] and he let satan
[1:35:51] get under the
[1:35:53] wall
[1:35:54] of the garden of eden
[1:35:57] a son of god
[1:36:01] a son of god
[1:36:04] let satan get in
[1:36:06] because he compromised with his wife
[1:36:09] on one word
[1:36:11] brother brown said one word off got him
[1:36:13] out of the garden he said one word off
[1:36:15] will not get you back in the garden
[1:36:18] so yes god i believe will watch over his
[1:36:21] word
[1:36:22] and he will have a group of people it
[1:36:24] may not be me may not be you but
[1:36:26] somebody in this world
[1:36:29] i believe is alive today
[1:36:32] that's going to do that
[1:36:34] it's going to not compromise with one
[1:36:36] word off
[1:36:38] that's gonna preach the word the way
[1:36:39] it's supposed to be and if you have to
[1:36:41] preach to the walls he preached to the
[1:36:42] walls
[1:36:44] but let's read this last one while we
[1:36:46] were here while we're at number nine
[1:36:48] as i was with moses so i'll be with thee
[1:36:51] now he had to divide the lands and there
[1:36:53] was 12 tribes to divide it by now what
[1:36:55] if he had some
[1:36:56] look
[1:36:58] what if he had had some picks and pets
[1:37:02] hmm
[1:37:03] our pet doctrine
[1:37:07] what if he'd had some picks and pets
[1:37:10] what if he liked the tribe again better
[1:37:11] than he'd like the tribe of ephraim
[1:37:13] tribe of joseph better than he did judah
[1:37:16] but he didn't do it that way
[1:37:20] he divided it according to the word
[1:37:21] revealed by the spirit
[1:37:24] he divided it according to tribe and
[1:37:26] noticed he done it by the revelation by
[1:37:29] discernment why because he wasn't there
[1:37:31] when those hebrew women
[1:37:32] screamed their names
[1:37:35] that was 500 years that way
[1:37:37] but the holy spirit didn't forget them
[1:37:40] brought those names right here and
[1:37:42] joshua said okay your name's reuben
[1:37:43] you're going to be your feet and oil
[1:37:45] we'll read that later on you're going to
[1:37:46] be with this and you're going to be with
[1:37:48] this and you're going to be with this
[1:37:49] and like brother brown said he didn't
[1:37:50] compromise because you know what
[1:37:52] everybody wants oil
[1:37:56] but not everybody gets oil
[1:37:59] listen god's going to give you what he
[1:38:02] knows you can handle
[1:38:06] what he knows you can handle
[1:38:09] and if we're mature enough you know what
[1:38:10] we'll do
[1:38:11] thank you lord you gave me the desert
[1:38:15] thank you lord i don't have a bit of
[1:38:16] water but you're the god of water you'll
[1:38:18] send rain when i need it
[1:38:20] if i need water i know where i can dig a
[1:38:22] well because you'll tell me where to dig
[1:38:24] that well
[1:38:25] i know that you're going to give me
[1:38:27] something even in my dry desert
[1:38:31] but like brother brown said what do we
[1:38:32] want to do
[1:38:34] we want to sneak over on ephraim's land
[1:38:36] because he's got green grass
[1:38:38] and we want to hurt our people over here
[1:38:40] i mean our cattle over here
[1:38:42] right because this one preaches a little
[1:38:44] more fiery that i'm i'm going there i'm
[1:38:46] not going there
[1:38:48] anyway
[1:38:51] by the discernment of god's spirit he
[1:38:53] did it
[1:38:55] so one of those mothers one each one of
[1:38:57] those mothers giving birth to those
[1:38:59] babies called their name and each one of
[1:39:01] their name has a meaning
[1:39:04] and what's our name tonight
[1:39:06] the bride
[1:39:08] of jesus christ
[1:39:10] not just the bride of jesus christ
[1:39:12] sister rebecca
[1:39:13] the bride of jesus christ that will come
[1:39:15] to adoption
[1:39:17] that we'll come to we haven't even got
[1:39:18] to that part yet where we're just now at
[1:39:21] the place where god gives you the
[1:39:22] checkbook and he's already got his name
[1:39:24] written down at the bottom of it
[1:39:26] right
[1:39:28] you just refilling what you need
[1:39:30] and hand it back to him
[1:39:32] but now what's what's full adoption
[1:39:36] get the blank check
[1:39:40] right
[1:39:41] and you write your name
[1:39:44] on the bottom and god
[1:39:46] doesn't go
[1:39:48] nah i don't think i'll do that no
[1:39:52] when you get when your name's written on
[1:39:54] there
[1:39:56] he knows
[1:39:57] that you're writing the good check
[1:40:00] and that's what we got to come to
[1:40:02] i believe
[1:40:04] that's what we're looking at just right
[1:40:05] here
[1:40:07] right here in front of our nose
[1:40:09] is we're coming to full adoption
[1:40:12] because remember look we'll get to it
[1:40:14] later on full adoption does not that's
[1:40:16] not the body change
[1:40:23] well adoption is the second stage
[1:40:27] the name is good on the checkbook is
[1:40:28] jesus's name the third pool whatever you
[1:40:31] want to name it
[1:40:32] our updated revelation is third pull
[1:40:35] where that will speak and god will
[1:40:36] answer
[1:40:38] all right
[1:40:41] brother branham didn't go on top of that
[1:40:43] mountain
[1:40:45] when he called the storm out of
[1:40:47] existence
[1:40:48] i don't even see where he was
[1:40:51] where he was praying
[1:40:53] he may have been praying in himself
[1:40:55] but remember the lord came to him and
[1:40:58] actually he was worried remember the
[1:40:59] story he was worried because that storm
[1:41:02] was coming in and he's trying to get
[1:41:03] them brothers off the mountain he said i
[1:41:05] knew i could make it because i'm a
[1:41:06] woodsman he said but some of them
[1:41:08] bless their heart probably probably
[1:41:10] didn't know anything about the woods and
[1:41:12] they were going to die so he was he was
[1:41:14] what concerned about his brothers and
[1:41:16] what god say
[1:41:18] whatever you say
[1:41:21] it'll happen
[1:41:22] and brother brown didn't just say storm
[1:41:24] go away he said storm go away
[1:41:26] sun come out and we'll have good weather
[1:41:29] for three days
[1:41:30] remember how many days that was he said
[1:41:32] but he was very specific
[1:41:34] about what he said
[1:41:38] storm
[1:41:40] we got to start first with the storms in
[1:41:41] our life
[1:41:43] we got to first start with the storms in
[1:41:45] our life
[1:41:46] you call that thing out
[1:41:50] like somebody was preaching the other
[1:41:51] day if you don't want it in your house
[1:41:53] get rid of it
[1:41:56] and if you get rid of the physical thing
[1:41:58] that's okay what about let's get rid of
[1:41:59] the spiritual stuff
[1:42:02] the spirits that what
[1:42:05] anoint us to do bad things
[1:42:07] christians mm-hmm
[1:42:10] yeah us
[1:42:16] time to clean house
[1:42:19] know who you are
[1:42:21] stand up for who you are
[1:42:24] and just say it
[1:42:26] let's stand our feet just say it
[1:42:29] whatever you need
[1:42:31] whatever whatever's going on in your
[1:42:33] life whatever disaster or or
[1:42:36] you know it's
[1:42:39] brother zach may have a problem with
[1:42:40] something that i don't even have a
[1:42:41] problem with but you know what it's real
[1:42:43] to him
[1:42:44] i may have a problem that some of you
[1:42:46] don't have and but it's real to me
[1:42:48] and we think oh they should get over
[1:42:49] that well no hang on a minute
[1:42:53] if you went through something somebody
[1:42:55] probably was standing over there going
[1:42:56] they should go
[1:42:57] they should be able to handle that
[1:43:00] it's like i told that girl it works for
[1:43:02] us at the post office
[1:43:05] dee was talking to some guy and he's
[1:43:07] real loud and
[1:43:08] kind of boisterous and when he left she
[1:43:09] said
[1:43:11] i said he's just kind of difficult to be
[1:43:12] around
[1:43:13] after he left and i looked at dee and i
[1:43:15] said
[1:43:16] we say that about you when you leave the
[1:43:17] room too
[1:43:19] so
[1:43:20] so you got to be careful
[1:43:22] that's what god will say he'll say i say
[1:43:24] it about you too buddy
[1:43:26] put you through a trial like somebody
[1:43:28] else did and just because you didn't
[1:43:29] make it out the same way that one did
[1:43:31] we're all individuals
[1:43:33] and that was what the placing was reuben
[1:43:35] if he would have stayed where he was at
[1:43:36] had been fined but remember they go all
[1:43:38] the way down and it gets down to where
[1:43:40] even before david's king
[1:43:43] judah separates from all of them
[1:43:46] now you've got two kingdoms you can't
[1:43:47] have two kingdoms in god's kingdom
[1:43:51] that's why they had a problem judah was
[1:43:52] always fighting israel israel fighting
[1:43:54] judah they were brothers
[1:43:57] same way with us get it back together
[1:44:00] let's sing a song

[1:46:51] like he's your friend he's supposed to
[1:46:52] be if it's hard to talk to god you need
[1:46:55] to be born again

[1:46:58] but just ask him said lord i don't i may
[1:47:00] be i may be over here in ephraim's field
[1:47:03] but i need to be over here in manassas
[1:47:06] because this is where i need to be
[1:47:09] like i said everybody a lot of people
[1:47:11] want to be this and want to be that it's
[1:47:13] what god wants you to be
[1:47:16] we've seen people that god rearranged
[1:47:18] their life so much to you look at them
[1:47:19] and go
[1:47:20] man
[1:47:23] only god could do that
[1:47:26] you know there's some people that that
[1:47:27] you meet in life and
[1:47:29] you know one thing's for sure
[1:47:31] they need god
[1:47:33] but when they get god
[1:47:35] you go man
[1:47:37] how'd that happen well
[1:47:40] your thought was how well you know how
[1:47:42] it could happen because you're praying
[1:47:44] for it lord change these people
[1:47:46] but let's start with lord change me
[1:47:49] change me first
[1:47:51] change me either so that i can be a
[1:47:53] conduit
[1:47:54] [Music]
[1:47:56] i want to be so yielded to god that he
[1:47:58] just speaks through me
[1:48:02] and not me myself want to do the
[1:48:03] speaking
[1:48:05] amen
[1:48:06] that's when we get something from the
[1:48:08] lord when we come here to this church
[1:48:10] expecting
[1:48:12] to not hear your favorite song
[1:48:17] or your favorite preacher
[1:48:19] or your favorite this
[1:48:22] but hear from god
[1:48:25] in worship
[1:48:28] you know we we're going to do that um
[1:48:30] we're going to dedicate the church up
[1:48:32] there and if they're watching in close
[1:48:33] your ears
[1:48:35] but we're going to dedicate that
[1:48:36] building up there
[1:48:40] but the people the one that needs to be
[1:48:42] dedicated
[1:48:46] because you take
[1:48:48] solomon there in the kings
[1:48:51] he built this great beautiful like we
[1:48:53] were talking about this great big temple
[1:48:55] that stood for hundreds of years
[1:48:56] never had a hammer never had a saw
[1:48:58] everything just fit romney just boom
[1:48:59] boom boom what would it be josiah if you
[1:49:01] had if you walked in tomorrow and every
[1:49:03] board was already cut
[1:49:05] every everything was already put right
[1:49:07] there and all you did is put it together
[1:49:08] like a like a lego or
[1:49:11] lincoln logs it don't happen that way we
[1:49:13] know that
[1:49:14] right
[1:49:15] because we have some saws and all these
[1:49:17] different things
[1:49:19] but when god anointed that temple
[1:49:22] he so anointed that temple
[1:49:24] nobody could talk
[1:49:26] [Music]
[1:49:28] the anointing of god fell so much in
[1:49:30] that building
[1:49:31] so the bible says the priest
[1:49:33] had to be quiet
[1:49:35] there was nothing said when the shekinah
[1:49:37] glory come down
[1:49:40] and then if you'll read
[1:49:42] solomon
[1:49:43] got down on his knees
[1:49:45] and he prayed a prayer
[1:49:47] read it in the bible
[1:49:50] he wanted that place so dedicated to the
[1:49:52] lord
[1:49:53] his daddy had desired it his daddy had
[1:49:56] looked for it
[1:49:58] but god promised that it would be
[1:50:00] through the son
[1:50:02] the son of man
[1:50:04] folks the son of man is what's building
[1:50:06] this temple right
[1:50:08] not saying it's not the son of god but
[1:50:10] i'm talking about the son of man
[1:50:12] it's what's building this temple
[1:50:16] it's me and you
[1:50:18] because that temple is transferred from
[1:50:19] wood
[1:50:21] to flesh
[1:50:23] and that's what god wants
[1:50:26] he does not want a holy building
[1:50:30] he wants a holy people
[1:50:33] that walk into that building
[1:50:35] and bring god with you
[1:50:37] sunday it was just so wonderful
[1:50:40] for those of you that weren't here you
[1:50:41] missed a hallelujah time
[1:50:44] god came down in that building and we we
[1:50:46] sang
[1:50:47] we didn't just sing we sang
[1:50:50] and god delivered people i'll that's
[1:50:53] what
[1:50:54] one time in my life
[1:50:57] i went and preached for brother joe i
[1:50:59] mean wasn't joe green at the time it was
[1:51:01] brother dan daisley
[1:51:03] and that service was so powerful
[1:51:06] you only get it a few times daddy will
[1:51:08] tell you i ever sermon ain't just every
[1:51:09] sermon is not a cloud and a
[1:51:12] and a harp
[1:51:13] and a and a horn right aaron
[1:51:16] okay
[1:51:18] i thought i might be the only one okay
[1:51:20] but uh
[1:51:22] i literally had my hand on the doorknob
[1:51:27] i wanted to get out there
[1:51:30] i didn't want to stay stuck in that room
[1:51:32] they were shouting and praising the lord
[1:51:34] so much till the pull was pulling me
[1:51:35] toward that door and i'd reach and get
[1:51:37] the door and i'd say no i'm not going to
[1:51:38] go out there because
[1:51:40] it came out right on the pulpit it was
[1:51:41] like the door right there it came around
[1:51:42] the pulpit and i didn't want to disturb
[1:51:45] that
[1:51:46] and it went off for
[1:51:48] minutes and minutes
[1:51:50] and minutes
[1:51:51] and minutes
[1:51:53] and when i walked out there
[1:51:55] it's just like
[1:51:57] water
[1:51:59] rushing through the building
[1:52:02] spoke so free
[1:52:05] till they still remember the sermon
[1:52:08] i preached on match and pieces like what
[1:52:09] brother dale preached in the 1990s 1995.
[1:52:13] what match here
[1:52:14] he's got to match and player up there
[1:52:16] and when it matches
[1:52:18] we're going home
[1:52:19] and they still remember that brother
[1:52:20] mike um
[1:52:22] orders the big tall singer every time i
[1:52:24] see him he says i still remember that
[1:52:26] sermon you preach and that was probably
[1:52:27] about 2001 or 2002
[1:52:31] but not saying anything from me but all
[1:52:33] of us if we'll let that let that flow
[1:52:36] let that thing you know say well i don't
[1:52:38] know if i want
[1:52:39] let her go
[1:52:41] there we go
[1:52:42] we have to get a bigger building we'll
[1:52:43] do something let her go push the walls
[1:52:46] out
[1:52:47] amen
[1:52:48] if it's for god i want it
[1:52:50] if it's for people i don't care anything
[1:52:52] about it
[1:52:53] but it's for god
[1:52:55] then we should do it
[1:52:56] it shouldn't be one service ever just in
[1:52:59] your lifetime
[1:53:01] it should be a time when the minister
[1:53:02] wants to come out that door not worried
[1:53:05] what's going to happen when he does open
[1:53:06] the door
[1:53:08] right bob
[1:53:09] that's right we want wanna we want that
[1:53:11] door open and we want just the freeness
[1:53:13] of god to come in and to all of us
[1:53:15] sunday school class everything
[1:53:17] everything we do when we come in here we
[1:53:19] ought to have a new attitude
[1:53:22] let's jack it up a notch
[1:53:24] let's go a little bit higher if you want
[1:53:26] to stomp around and play the tambourine
[1:53:28] get that tambourine out
[1:53:30] there's one right here brother joel
[1:53:32] it needs some use
[1:53:36] exercise your gift listen that's what
[1:53:38] placing is folks
[1:53:41] you get in your place
[1:53:42] and you know when you get in your place
[1:53:45] it's not you worshiping

[1:54:30] pray for the home church here that
[1:54:31] everything will be fine here father and
[1:54:33] we pray that you just have your hand on
[1:54:34] everything that we do forgive us of our
[1:54:36] sins and many mistakes that we make lord
[1:54:38] we are
[1:54:39] we're a blessed group of people
[1:54:41] and lord we're so blessed to be able to
[1:54:43] ask our father anything in his name and
[1:54:45] he'd give it to us so lord in the name
[1:54:47] of the lord jesus christ whatever you
[1:54:49] need tonight you just lift your hand and
[1:54:51] say god it's mine
[1:54:53] lord it's my possession and i take it in
[1:54:55] the name of the lord jesus christ
[1:54:56] because satan hates that name that's why
[1:54:58] i don't want people to be baptized in
[1:54:59] that name
[1:55:00] it's because he hates your name lord
[1:55:02] because there's power behind that name
[1:55:05] all heaven and earth is named jesus
[1:55:07] and lord
[1:55:09] the prophet of god told us whatever
[1:55:11] scripture speaks of the bridegroom also
