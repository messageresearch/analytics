[Music] amen and amen and amen and i want to see him don't you good to see everybody in the house of the lord and have everybody connected out on their airwaves and everything we're just appreciated i was sitting there thinking i'd give a little quote there the other night where the prophet said that when these persecutions and things come and said we'd be meeting in old store buildings and homes and things well we are already meeting in homes around the the day and the hour we're already doing that so we're fulfilling the word amen but it's good to be able to say that we can at least worship and and for the time being you know anything it may get to where we can't things may tighten down but when it does then god will take care of it there and everything will be right on time but but it's good to be in the house of the lord if you like turn in your scripture turn to revelations 3 we'll go to verse 14. then we'll go to john 4 and john 1. you know so just uh you know let's see my web announcements now remember the lord willing what a way to be doing this afternoon uh i'm saying these if brother louise will be taking wednesday services right all right then brother uh aaron and

keep us in jesus name amen okay revelations 3 14 because this is to this age so we'll be taking a little thought in the next two or three messages to uh you know tie together something uh i don't know how it's gonna work out because i may have to just back off and say okay wade you finish yours because i know what he's heading to on it but i'm just trying to stay where i was on the basis of the life's thoughts that we had you know of the point of being two creations are a spiritual creation and a natural creation and so we're still going to be dealing with that line and thought you know uh to where it can be because one is a spiritual the other one is a natural on it so just remember that and unto the angel of the church of the lady of siam's right these things saith the amen the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of god amen now let's go to john 4 24. excuse me find where i'm at okay very familiar scripture with all of us says god is a spirit and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth okay back up to 118. it says no man has seen god at any time the only begotten son which is in the bosom of the father he has declared him amen you may be seated the lord had his blessing to the reading of the word so remember these announcements and things and of the future parts of brother luis with the service wednesday and we'll be here the lord willing on those things but then for the weekend brother uh aaron and brother bob will be taking over uh forrest cohen will be going up to dedicate the building okay um my wife wrote me a note wanted me to read thanks to the church for everything so let's get that says my wife and for about my wife and i it's you know okay because she's i've been involved in it too uh we want to thank you everyone for the calls the prayers food that was sent and then even the time of the anniversary when people gathered and come in and gifts and the different things over our anniversary and knowing that was 62 years so we've had a wonderful time together we're so blessed for having such godly people here in our church we are so glad to have each one of you to cross our path here on earth still pray for my wife she has an uh she was negative on the point of the test but still their sinuses is bothering their drainages and things she's coughing a lot pray the lord will take care of all of that and do that so just remember to give her as much prayer as you can because the lord knows we need prayer and everything but just just pray for her okay all right now i i took a thought there the other day with with uh points you know and i said i'd i'd picked up some thoughts but uh brother aaron the other night remember when early other weeks or so ago he brought out a point and i wrote it down and i thought well i'll keep that because that's a good point but he brought out his point was that uh you know three things as it goes forth first it's a secret all right you remember that and then this message he was bringing first it's a secret the secret is something that's totally hidden no one knows what it is they don't know how to explain it because if he did it wouldn't be a secret i'm not in the days of what a lot of people thinks you know they say well it's a secret as long as you tell the other person not to tell what you're telling them and it's if they do you tell that person not to tell the other person what they're telling you know they're trying to make some secret part now a secret is something that cannot be comprehended by the natural mind it is a total secret and it's held into that position and that's the way god does things all right see then the next it comes from a secret to a mystery then you begin to understand a little bit about what this secret is but it's still a mystery all right it's still uh covered over or whatever you want to call it place to where that you can't see it perfectly the way you want to but see then the third thing is when anything is revealed or made manifest you know and taken it so then that way the word of god comes into view so remember the point and i wrote that down i thought that's a good thing because it's it's when we started studying this message you reach you pick up the bible you begin to read it's it's just a secret you know and you read it you try to study it and things like that but it stays a secret until things take place then it can move into a point of a mystery but remember it's a mystery and a mystery cannot be explained all right see then it takes a revelation to explain the mystery and then you'll see the secret it'll all come into view and i thought well that's that's a good point i'll i'll i'll uh i'll leave it on that all right because what we've been trying to do now and i want to continue on our thought um see what i've been trying to do is to bring out a point to look at it that from this point of the secret to mystery you know in the manifestation until light is brought upon a mystery it's still a secret but then when light shines upon that mystery all right then it begins to unveil and you begin to see the secret all right so what have we been talking about going back before the foundation of the world going back into the mind of god to where that we could could uh you know begin to see things and to understand it all right and then we're going to be dealing with beginning of creation for a little bit you know a couple of services on on doing it uh and i'm reading the title that you'll see the prophet used it be it's the beginning of the the the the opening of the word trying to get a little something to before you can see that it takes the prophet then to take the mystery and explain it and once he explains that then it's no longer a secret thing but yet there's still something supernatural left that you cannot understand all right see until it's fully revealed or made known or made manifest as a better word for it because it comes more into reality all right so you started off with where we were on our last couple of messages talking about what that as god is bringing forth his word to you and me then we begin to understand what he has in his mind that he wants to be revealed okay we can go through and we will we'll pick it up a little more in the next message or two where you know where you can can see that that he wanted this to be understood it was in his mind it was a mystery uh in his mind he wanted it revealed how that he was god he was savior but remember now we have to to understand a lot of things you remember the last points we were thinking on you have to understand something by revelation because uh you know just like i was trying to express one point i remember that that see god did not have to create but he done that for his own purpose of what it would bring forth his desires our manifestation and he could bring things into being and it would be a no longer a mystery but it'd be something revealed to you and i so he would show himself as father healer etc but remember he could be father when he created adam and eve he could actually be called father when he created the angels before the world all right so there are some things that can be without it having to be in full manifestation see then it comes on over as a savior now that it means there's got to be something lost all right so just remember study your bible or your thoughts in that point that in genesis when god created adam and eve he could be he was a father there was his manifestation he was a father he didn't have to go through being sin entering the picture et cetera so he had adam and eve in the garden in a beautiful situation all right then sin entered the picture and once sin entered the picture then all right it became a problem and all and he would have to come and die and cover that so that's what i want us to kind of do today is to kind of back up into some of those thoughts and and be able to bring it out to where that you can see that god's mystery secret has been made known i believe that i believe the prophet has made that known we don't have to wonder about it we've got the message see so all we got we just studied the message it goes like the christ is a mystery and we can go through all of those things and and so great of a message that he he even said it in there he he said and we emphasize that a little bit but uh he said now he didn't say go back to the seals and go over this do that or daniel 70 weeks if you don't understand these things he said go to christ a mystery all right see then because that's a mystery but remember now it was a secret things has to do problem and things have to come into view then it becomes a mystery you remember when you first heard the prophet talking i thought man uh i'm enjoying what he's saying but this is getting too far i mean he we'll read it in a minute where he says that god's first creation was god himself and he said well wait just a minute now there's something wrong here i still have a mystery you know i'm still wondering about these things but yet then when he explains it it's no longer a mystery it becomes a revelation to you and i and that's what we want to do is to back up into the back part of god's mind and come out of there with having the natural understanding you know or not say natural understanding because this is the point beginning of the creation all right first off the word beginning if you look it up websters and the things and look it in in your your concordances and things you'll find it's an odd word and we all look at it like something that is not there but all at once it becomes there and we call that a beginning i mean we we say that's a beginning all right now that's that's the point of the word but it's not the emphasis that i want to be brought into it see a beginning to me is when something is brought into light not say when it begin i mean uh this is one brother branham says it really got me he said the tv was in genesis he said in the garden well i i i got a little sense i think we all got a little bit but it's not talking about a box sitting there that was a ge or or whatever you know you plug it in and it runs all this stuff it's some things that was taking place all right and see it was things coming from genesis that was a secret then it comes into manner to more of a mystery but then it becomes into a point of being revealed or made known to the eye the word that you can comprehend all right see now when light shines on an object light will bring that object into view that you can see what it is all right now it was sitting there maybe thousands of years you know that's what it's talking about the tv and the things he's saying see it was dire but yet it didn't come into being see the tv was there the things were there but it didn't come into being until we're in the 40s or 30s or 40s when the tv began to come into view you know that we could see those things all right you say well it had a beginning well where did it have its beginning it had its beginning in the garden but we didn't see it like that it was a secret and it's still in a mystery once it even was brought out i don't understand it i don't i remember most of you don't remember not old enough to remember the old tubes and and the old tvs when you when you had a thing this big and that big and that big and a little screen this big most of you don't remember nothing like that because you're you're not old enough but i remember there was a man that used to work on tvs well he said at my house one night and he explained to me for probably an hour what made the tv work well you know what when he left it's still a secret and he made it a mystery because he really made it you know because if you'll remember something in the bible terminologies when you're looking at something that is not fully made known just remember hold on to that real close because it's got to go from a secret to a mystery to the spiritual eye right now remember the two creations we're talking about what spiritual creation and then physical or natural creations and and things to be coming into view but the spiritual creation comes first so we back up before time could ever begin and we look at it as being trying to comprehend almighty god all right and see without this prophet to express it unto us we would have never had a chance of understanding theologians can't understand i mean if you told a theologian that the genesis that the tv was back there i mean he he he would go haywire with you because he wouldn't you know understand that unless he was a real smart person because then you had to bring this together you had to get this together you had to get this together you had to do this together you had to get all this together finally it began to work you know and i never could understand the what they call it the cat hired uh radio where they see they had you could actually it was some way could that thing would actually make sounds and and do it and all like that because it to me it's still a mystery yeah you know all right but now my point look at it what is the beginning of something there's whole thing settle down to one thing what is the beginning to you is it when something comes into existence or is it when something comes into the point of that you can comprehend so there's a secret then mystery see something moving to a point you could comprehend amen when you think about god and the way the prophet described it as elohim self-existing he existed alone nobody was with him he was back there all by himself all he had was attributes and none of those attributes were in manifestation because none of them had been brought forth yet he was not a father he was all that he wasn't god because god is an object of worship and there was nothing to worship him we can go through the whole message backwards and forth as the prophet has brought it unto us to understand but yet in finishing it all up when did something begin when did god begin he said well brother dale god didn't begin well now you're right that's that's okay god didn't begin he had no beginning but just remember jesus had a beginning god had no beginning now we've got a mystery how would jesus be almighty god but yet have a beginning see it takes a lot of understanding i'm trying to get us to look at something new because looking at it then as something you see first by the spiritual eye that's right you got to see it by the eye of faith you've got to accept it by faith and you can't say well i i don't you're just saying that back there you know there was a time that he wasn't god it was he was always god he always was god and always will be god but there was a time he could not be understood are you following me now a time that he could not be comprehended then the theologians can come along and take the wordings and things they could do pretty good they could come up with sunships and things of course they'd run it into eternals and and mess it up but but yet they could come forth and understand the logos theophany the brother around them never developed them words i mean them words was here when he came and if you'll read him a lot of times he'll let's see which one is it uh i'll think of it in a minute but he pronounces it one word like logos will deceive that but he'll pronounce it in different messages it's got an entirely different sound and he'll start out on something and it sounds the way he's pronouncing it it doesn't sound right then in a minute he'll pronounce it correctly it's like he's gaining ground and i'm sure that's what he's doing you know he's understanding how to pronounce those words not that he's going to school but god is going god is schooling him to bring him into the place that he could bring that down to me and you and that's where i thank god for the point of it it all right and and getting to the point then see that you see things first by the spiritual eye of faith all right then it can come into reality manifestation making it known well when is the beginning i'm just getting the just letting you think on your mind see we think a beginning is when something started you know but we can put that as it started right here well then we realized like going to say the atom bomb for instance you know it took many many years to develop that to a point that you could split an atom you know it took scientists many many years to come to an understanding of how to split an atom and then they turn around and say i've got enough right here in my hand to be able to blow the world up and you say i don't see it well that's the point it's still kept secret until it was with the made known and then the secret little keys you know that they had to come up with i don't i say understanding is the key to me all right but i'm i'm asking you to think with me on spiritual eye of faith and how that will come in to a point that your natural eye will soon begin to comprehend things and you can see god in what you're looking at not see god may be standing there not a physical being standing but see him in the trees in the grass and the things and all like that see and you begin to see it like brother bradham would say there over and over what he said you've never seen me we'll get to that on our second stage because this is what we're going to do stage one and stage two stage three stage one we're going to cover god and the basis of him coming into being amen then we'll come in to the word the logos of things etc of that coming into a spiritual being then we'll cover the the beginning of the creation of god as to the mind of christ and the christian and what we are how that you're a christian and see now you are a child of god you're a christian you it's developed into something that's more realistic or tangible all right but now think about it going back in god's mind to the point that we can comprehend that we read the scripture there that says and we'll get to it in a minute where he says no man is seeing god all right now we can take that and we can use that and and but yet we can use our minds in the wrong direction and and then you'll start doing and saying because the prophet is trying to bring it from a secret to a mystery to a found a revelation and you remember the the little child that asked the mama can i see god ask the preacher can you see god ask everybody you know could see god no you can't see god then run across the right one and see that was sitting in the boat said son said everything i've ever seen is god well it's according to how you're looking see that man that when it come to the point that man had over the years in his christian experience serving god and being with god he had developed a uh i guess he'd call it a point to where that he could see god but he could see it in what god made all right and see that's the way we have to see it we look back and we see a beginning and we think a beginning is a starting point it's true it's don't misunderstand me just understand now what i'm saying for the next tale it is a starting point but yet we look at the starting point as to the atom and we say oh well all you got to do is is go over there and throw that switch it'll blow the world up well that's close that can be done because of the bombs the things that are done but yet it took so long to bring that out to get it to where that we can understand because if you remember they were really afraid to set off the first atom bombs because they were afraid that it would start a chain reaction that would just keep rolling the atom and would keep splitting all right then they found out that technically when they split the atom that they did not split it halfway this was greater coming on understanding they didn't when that adam come on and they began to start using they found out they didn't split it height and height they missed it a little well see that was what kept it from blowing up that's you get it that's what kept the world from blowing apart was the splitting of that atom where they'd missed it just enough well god had to plan that and bring everything into being to keep us from being annihilated you know all right but think about it now when you think about beginning or you think about creation what do you think about what do you consider in your mind when you say god had no beginning it will never have any ending but jesus had a beginning and jesus at a time that his body had to be redeemed so now you say okay oh wait you just give us the key because you're talking about his body that's right see because that's what we want to get to remember one thing in body he was a man tangible in spirit he was god so the bible says that god was in christ reconciling the world unto himself where he was in that flesh that walked the shores of galilee but one day that flesh now had a beginning that's right all right now having a beginning it would have to have an ending and it did one day that body was made eternal that's right okay now you've got the whole thing that god and christ are one right see i'm talking about the godhead i'm trying to to get us to think on these things to clear up a little thoughts in their mind about the godhead see when did god begin he said well he didn't begin he always was yeah but he can call himself the beginning revelation it says the beginning of the creation of god and the prophet said we'll read it a minute where he said most people think that that means god created jesus and jesus created everything else he said that's not correct he said what he is that he's the beginner or author you know like author writer beginner author of the creation of god now then what we're trying to do what i'm trying to get you to think about is there was a time that when you remember that you studied your bible you read things but yet one day you heard this prophet and he started explaining and he was trying to understand one god and get it in the correct order and the prophet said now see thou he said i'm a father i'm a son and said i'm a human being he said but i'm just one and he said now that's the way god is amen wait a minute this secret that i couldn't understand because i read the bible but i couldn't understand the secret because i went into the mystery but see one day things began to unfold a little further as it became to a mystery and the prophet began to explain that mystery say i can see that what could you see it by not natural light but by the eye of faith you could see that god could was what he was trying to do was reveal himself all right now that's what i want you to think on until we get through the series of this of the beginning of something is when god is going to try to bring it from the secret may have to come through a mystery a mysterious but one day it's going to be made known that's what we've had if you understand what i'm getting at we've had a wonderful marvelous time in god's word to understand what mankind could not understand it was a secret it's still a secret to them the best it can do is make it a mystery right it can just become mysterious but it doesn't help but see the end time bride has brought the prophet has brought the message to the entire bride until he could just talk of things it's so simple it would just be you know your mind is is baffled in what he would say you remember when you first started reading you started studying this message from and it it's it's mysterious and he'd say now now we don't believe in eternal sonship but he said we can understand eternal godhead that's right you can't have an eternal sonship but you can have an eternal godhead you can understand it that way see now it's coming from something that was totally even a secret to mankind and it comes into a mystery that we begin to understand a little bit about these things so then the beginning of anything is when something begins to be made known we'll solve that whole thing i hope you understand what i've been trying to get to with the point the beginning of something is when something can be comprehended that's the best way for me to describe a beginning is when something comes to the point it can be understood maybe he's still mysterious yeah because even brother branham made that point you know he said the mystery is a thing that's revealed but said even as a supernatural element remains despite the fact that it's been revealed to you we don't understand all of it no no we don't claim to understand all of it but we've come to the point of being able to understand some things about god that we're always long to understand when we read you know no man can see god at any time god is a spirit they that worship me must worship him in spirit and truth we had a beginning time that we could start comprehending right a beginning time that when we could start comprehending or start being able to see or understand amen all right so think about how long you've been in this message and what you've studied in comparison to dave to what you see to what it was when you first started you know i mean when you first started you know yourself that it was just it was just a total mystery it might have become from a secret to beginning to understand a little bit it was but it was a total mystery because we couldn't understand it because we were trying to figure it out and put words in there instead of thinking about what is being said so what was the prophet trying to do explain words you know i mean you think about what we do a lot of times you know and we start talking to somebody about one god and what do we say say you know now there's just one god and said now remember he was a logos gossip theophany and they're standing there looking at you what is the logos one is the theophany and see you've really made it a secret because a lot of times what we do we make it a mystery god's trying to reveal itself we're trying to make him a mystery claiming to be able to understand all right but listen when something begins to come into being that you can comprehend it there's your beginning there's your beginning of it now you can start thinking about what that beginning is but it's beginning in your thinking see it's becoming from a secret to a mystery to you all right see then god can reveal that make it known he can show himself and then you and i can understand it the kids then can understand it but remember that when it comes to the list it's a mystery until it's revealed now when it's revealed then you can say i see it but you know you're i think you'll agree with this point have you ever seen something so clear it's just so beautiful clear you're thinking on it and it's just so clear and you say i'm going down and explain to donnie what i just saw and it's so beautiful in your mind and you have such a vast understanding that you can go all the way back before the world with it and come down and see how god does this and you walk up to dawn and you say donny i'd like to oh it's gone you don't ever do that it's gone then you got to go find that mystery and to see if see what's where you missed it out but what you missed it at is one thing now here's what's hard it's trying to explain something there's ways of explaining things that will help us i was telling anybody donnie can do it he can take a car apart put it back together i take it apart and i do like i did with my wife one day when you know how the carburetor kits were the old two barrels especially you know they had a whole bunch of kits and parts in them you know and and you didn't have to have all of it they were just certain things fit that certain carburetor so i was tearing the carburetor apart and put it back together and surprisingly it run and my wife she said what's all of these i said i didn't need them you know well you know what that meant to her what do you mean you're supposed to put them in ain't you no i didn't need them well see i wasn't saying they were i didn't explain to her that that carburetor can't fit about 10 different carburetors you know all right but you see a mystery now think about it i'm trying to get to a point to just ease into a thought when you're talking about and let's let's read that one go ahead number one brother and let's let's just read this because i want to get this point to us of what we're talking about this is taken from the lady of seeing church age the beginning of the creation of god that is who the lord jesus says he is now he's describing himself to the church age right look that is who the lord jesus says he is but those words don't mean exactly as they sound to us just taking them the way they sound has made some people in fact multitudes of people get the idea that jesus was the first creation of god making him lower than godhead then this first creation created all the rest of the universe and whatsoever it contains now when we get through explaining to the next stage stage two when we hit stage two you're gonna think that that's exactly what he's saying then you're gonna have to say wait just a minute we've got to get this in the right place cause we'll make a greater mystery out of it cause we'll come right back to this huh in this first creation created all the rest of the universe and whatsoever it contains but that is not right you know that doesn't line up with the rest of the bible well then who created what see the words are he is the beginner and then you say okay he just being our author okay of the creation of god now we know that for surety that jesus is god very god he is the creator all right now think about what he's saying he's the beginner take that beginner as to be now a point of what i'm trying to establish that there was a time it could not be comprehended there was a time when when no one could understand god i mean and then he began to send his prophets with the word amen and they could start telling about god and it could come into being all right so then he's the beginner or author see now to me when he says he's a beginner or author author is a you know somebody writing you're writing down well see what i'm looking at is there was a time we could not comprehend god whatsoever but he begins to condescend toward mankind and as he does he becomes the author of many different uh stages many things comes into view that we'll see him move to from father to son and that's not another person that's the same person but yet it's what he's doing see he's the beginner he's starting to tell the story he's beginning to define our under let us understand you know how did he come into being and he begins to be the author or the writer the writer would signify the beginning again see or the thought is your beginning you're writing it down he brought it to the point we could understand it so then he's not the beginning of the creation of god like god created jesus and jesus created everything else no he's moving from one stage to that next stage to the next stage and doesn't change his personality as being who he is may i say it this way away ahead of time god never sent his son to die come on he came himself the one that died was the father that died for you and i but how'd he die he couldn't die of god our father he had to die as a human being that's right amen condescending or descending or or whatever your thoughts are of god as he brings himself into being and he's doing that from being the beginner of something or anything that needs it he's looking you out you're looking out over the banisters the prophet will read these things and he said what do we see he said we see a little white light because it goes across and that's what you know i remember those because i'd read my my bible a little and he said see there he said that's that logos you know i didn't have much understanding of that but he said see there he said that's the son of god son of god now wait just a minute there's something wrong here because i'm getting up another person over here but i ain't losing nothing over here because that's what you think you're supposed to do no just remember one thing don't throw away nothing that's revealed amen yes sir just watch it unveil it watch it in time with the laps over but it still will unveil itself amen it'll start unveiling and start being made manifest to be seen right right all right see then it's not that god created jesus and jesus created everything else [Music] but yet it is true that the word which is the son of god is the creator god that's right this is what i say don't throw nothing away just let it unveil let it go to the next stage to the next stage that you see it to where that you can say hey look we're we're going all the way back the prophet would cure us back to the mind of god and then he'd go back and he'd say to the back part of god's mind amen that's just going on back past where you can comprehend all right and see that eternity has no beginning and has no ending to it there was a time that we couldn't comprehend these things it meant god would have to send the prophets to unveil all the way down through yeah that's right and i remember expressing it here one time to the church when he was talking about son of man i said don't worry about son of man we need to get son of god straight i said now when when do you think the son of god had a beginning well everybody said 2000 years ago i said even scofield and these theologians let's read to them right here even they know better than now that's right they knew that that logos that theophany was the word he says it i mean scofield puts it in his notes they could see that it was the word and see by understanding it being the word then it could come forth into to a beginning there was a time we couldn't understand then it slowly began to unfold well all right arthur here it unfolded from father we can see he's a father it unfolded into creator god son etc but never lost one person in all of that dude he kept it going all right see the point of to me when i look at the beginning of something i try to go back to find out the real beginning of it instead of just looking out of the car and saying there's a car see i can remember that that car was one time it didn't exist like that and we're not after who what was his name in the the uh comics trip was invented the wheel who was that thor what was his name one of them you know he remember he invented the wheel put a rod through the wheel and he'd stand on it and ride it you know that's uh uh we're not going back that far we're you know and they'd peddle it and do everything but now listen not to make a joke but to make a point the word beginning says to originate all right to be originated or being a religion and they need a nader see it means to origin it means something that had a point that at one time it seemingly didn't exist but then it moves into a position that can be comprehended into a point that you begin to see that it does exist all right see then you look back and you see that before all of this god has existed alone amen yet in him he had attributes but those attributes was his desires and things he wanted to be made manifest he wanted to bring him into being he wanted to bring his family into being like i said he could be father with adam and eve that's why i believe it like i do that adam had eternal life in his soul eve had eternal life in her soul and see i want that start that's the point i want to look at because that's the point when we get on stage two we're gonna have to see that man come from adam and them all the way to jesus what we're doing here doing this for a few more minutes they're just taking the point of trying to look at something and saying when did that begin right without looking at it it's trying to figure out when it began it's just realize that there's something that as it began it really it was beginning in me and you to come into being that's right not to joking with the guy but he made a wheel well you know things started see we think of the start of something is the beginning of it and that's true all right but remember there was a lot of other things took place before that beginning could come into being that's right and see that way you can go all the way back into god all right the author beginning or author an author is a person who writes a novel or a poem something like that to express their thoughts you know to bring those things into being so he's the beginning of the creation of god now here's the one point i want us to deal for just a second he's the first one of a kind the beginning is based on that basis he's the first one of a kind that's the beginning of something the first one of a kind whether it be wheel whether it be this whether it be that what it be it's the first one of a kind all right so then there was a time that our understanding could not comprehend that way of looking at something other than saying well they were yeah it finally come into being there but to realize that way back before that physical part come into being there was a lot of things had to move in to bring that physical part into being you know it had to be a lot of things happen over time time elements and all like that for god to be able to bring it forth all right now listen let's get a couple of these little things and we'll go ahead to number two all right now god created man in his own image his own likeness what kind of a man did he create what he created a spirit spirit man now what would be a spirit man see he didn't bring him into flesh man he brought him in a spirit man like himself if you look at it god can divide himself but never separates nothing never loses or in a matter of fact he gains that's the one thing i think of the the beginning of the creation of god and the thing that as god unveiled himself you realize every time he gives a new birth he's expanding himself when he gives a new birth to a child of god you know gives you the new birth he's expanding himself he's not losing ground he ain't going to run out his brother moat said run out of pieces and run out of god no you're not going to do it every time he gives it out it increases just like he took that bread and the fish every time he'd take that bread and pull it off and it down it just didn't carry his sins and it just kept increasing all right think on that now to the spirit now amen now notice after he had made all the creation and created a spirit man the close reading of this now to the one that asked the question that god give dominion of the cattle and the fishes and everything to this man now physically that's true mainly what's he explaining but in his making up there he made man in his own image to lead the cattle lead the beast of the field just like the holy spirit leads the believer today see it's more the holy spirit is the leader that's in you that's why uh i remember one time we went down to robert hollins and he had an old german shepherd that boy was rough and uh he was up in the back of the truck well i started to go around and i told my wife and then i said y'all go ahead and i'll stand between the dog and you you know if he jumps and brother tatum he's coming up through there and he walked right by me and he just went right and that dog went and i had seen him by the tire in jeffersonville indiana we were sitting up there and brother jeffrey says you better pull that tire off that dog had bit that tire and ripped out the side of it you know it was that tough big old german shepherd brother tatum walked right by me and he said why blackie what are you doing that dog went and i've seen a man up in um irwin tennessee do that one day the one that was really going reddit and he just walked up and laid his hand on him see there's something about some people that's different i ain't gonna do it i don't have it okay you die you go ahead but i i will do one thing i'll tell you say well if you're going to remember that just give me your hat because if you ever have trouble with a dog just take your hat off just hold it out in front of you unless that dog is trained he never moved no further just hold your hand behind that they say you can do it with a knife i've never done it with a knife i've done it with a hat they say you can flick a knife and do it but i'm my point okay creations are what we get listen he was in other words adam the first man in the lower creation of god now look where we're getting to a mystery a secret again today yeah we're going to read this again okay so listen that's why i said we go so far and i see what he's going i'll back up and train off on something else and preach on it and come back to it he was in other words adam the first man in the lower creation of god the first creation of god first creation was god himself then out of god came to logos the first creation was god himself you mean god had a beginning to us yeah yes to him no that's right he never had a beginning amen so what is your prophet saying see first creation was god himself in other words the first one coming into being if you're standing looking out over the banisters of time and looking back and you look back there and you see a little halo of light that's god coming into being what coming into a position that you can comprehend him you can see it a little by the eye of faith not the natural outside but you can see it you can understand him just a little but he just keeps unveiling himself and keeps on doing it see which was the son of god look at it then out of the logos which was the word in the beginning was the word the words with god and the word was god and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us and out of the logos came forth the man the man that he's what is what man has he built the spirit man the spirit man spirit man is the first man because he first created adam in spirit man then he created genesis 2 and put him in natural body all right so adam had a beginning right of the spirit part because that was what was brought into being but he had a beginning and physical all right you say well in the beginning just means a star or something so okay adam it started here and it started here now you got two that's what i kept emphasizing the other day on that message that where you've got two creations you've got a spiritual creation and then you've got a physical creation spiritual creation is just like that what did god do he made man in his image all right what is his image spirit man all right now we're in the bible god is a spirit okay see now hold that point god is a spirit he's not just a spirit like non-existence or anything like that he's a being he's a person so that spirit man that was created in genesis was put into flesh in genesis in two was the baptism of the holy ghost or the eternal god the soul of adam was god's own being placed within adam eternal life brother so he said today he asked a question about that theophany see we're going to get into some thinking it'll take stage two and we get to a lot of doing it but still adam adam had the breath of it that spirit man that he first created was put into the physical man that was his second creation our literal creation and eve was the sign because he was in adam and he was in adam and theophany all right then she was taken and put into flesh me and when he did there you've got two creations you've got two beginnings if you understand what i'm saying i'm trying to describe a beginning when your mind is not locked on oh beginning beginning of adam was when he was made in flesh now the beginning of adam was when he was made in spirit man his spirit man that was his first beginning all right so god is the author of all creation amen he created all things spiritual and he created all things natural that's right and without him was not anything made the bible said that was made see god's first creation the first creation was god not meaning there was a time he didn't exist then all at once he jumps over into a no there was a time that they was he existed in a situation he existed in a position or do it to where that nobody could comprehend that so he then moves out of that existence because we can't comprehend him in that existence he moves into another form see bringing him toward flesh but not making him flesh we got to get that second we got to get that part in it on part two of what we'll get to we've got to get it to where we we don't have no trouble when we look up there and look at what he's saying first creation was god himself then out of god came the logos which was the son of god well now that looks like here's god and then out of god comes a son of god i got the quotes i like to bring every bit over where you can think about it wrote around said see he gave birth to his first son now remember what the bible says about him he's the beginning of the creation of god when did god have a beginning physically in jesus christ right we'll get to those more in jesus christ physically in jesus christ he became a son but spiritually was when god condescended from one point to another point it's the same god i got to quote here's what the prophet said did he send his son he said no he came himself so what happened here from this did this being here become this being as another person whether it become a son no this i don't know how you're going to explain it you can't explain it no other way but then you've got to make sure you explain that it's not eternal sonship see just remember if you'll keep it in mind god never sent a son to die he came himself who came himself the great jehovah self-existing elohim that existed back there before anything ever was or whatever he moves over into another part or a being in the point of revealing himself making himself known he keeps unveiling himself unveiling himself and one day he steps into flesh the same god the same being the same person that's where you got your one god correct so you ain't got to god in three persons because we're not dealing in three persons when i look back and see god before the world i see almighty god as one amen all right now listen to what i'm saying who created now we're going to have to think a little bit when we get on to that but just remember the father never created the son created but who is the who is the son the father made manifest not another person but it's just a point of understanding see what was the next stage he explains it what in other words adam the first man in the lower creation of god the first creation was god himself then out of god came the logos which was the son of god not another person same person moves over into another form and he just keeps moving he keeps moving he comes through the old testament with the prophets and the things and he just keeps moving but one day he just stepped right out in flesh a body thou hast prepared me now that's one thing the father did create that's the best way of saying it the father did create that body because i'm quoting brother brown think on these things i'm just trying to get a point to you to think on what he's trying to do the beginning of our creation all right let's let's see go ahead let's do the number 26 stop on that one there you go this is off questions and answers it says no man has seen the father at any time now wait a minute wait a minute that man told that little boy all i've ever seen is see now you're tripping over your own feet it's not talking about that look what he's answering look no man has seen the father at any time no man can see god in the bodily form because god is not in body form god is a spirit all right no man had seen the father but the only begotten of the father hath declared him begotten adam was god's first created son jesus was god's begotten son begotten by a woman adam and eve when adam didn't come from a woman he was created but jesus came from a woman the body the flesh the man came from a woman so then he's right look what he's saying no man has seen the father you remember they said that show us the father he turned around to him he said have i been so long weed you don't know me says if you've seen me you've seen the father okay that's fine but he wasn't talking about a flesh body right it was the man inside of there that body had a beginning as a human element but the one that was inside of there was the almighty god himself the father made manifest in another form called a son amen right the father made manifest in another form called the son just keep him thoughts in mind how he just keeps unveiling himself from one thing to another because just remember there's three stages to what we're talking about stage three is you okay we ain't got there yet stage three is you because you're the beginning of the creation of god that's the message to this age not something that's going to begin something that's done already begun all right think on these things by the spiritual eye let's go to a little bit further which one we'll get 26. all right but notice now there's nothing there just space there's no light there's no dark there's no nothing it's just seems nothing but in there now i i'm like these folks i've i've always tried to understand things in a spiritual sense just remember there was no darkness there either because he was delight it wasn't a dark that's emphasis that's explaining that's trying to to get the human mind to go from a darkness to a light to understanding just remember i've never had any idea even in the trinitarian concept that it was just darkness no that's just expressing it right where he's at is light but it's a different light different from what we are see but in there as a great supernatural being jehovah god who covered all space of all places at all times he was from everlasting from everlasting he is the beginning of creation now that's the title i've picked for that because that's what he's doing when you say beginning of the creation of god you get into emphasize but when he's the beginning of creation he's the author that's god can't see nothing that's when this person had a being who was he the great supernatural being jehovah god standing there then he begins to unveil and he says let there be light um now you explain this to me one day because the bible says if you think i'm wrong on the point of emphasis think on gen on revelation when it comes down to the point that we have no need of the light what about coming to a place that didn't have no need of the light it's just an emphasis no need of the light why because he's the light and wherever he's at is going to be and wherever you're at is going to be a light not a light following you around you're not holding your little candle up no wherever you are is light because ye are the light of the world because he's the light of the world all right he is the beginning of creation that's god can't see nothing can't hear nothing not a move of an atom in the air not nothing no not no air no nothing but yet god was there that was god now let's watch for a few minutes after a while no man has seen the seen that now that's the father that's god the father what no light no nothing we think it's darkness we think it's just totally everything that is exciting no light nor nothing like that don't get that in your idea everywhere he's at his life he said brother dale you seem to have the emphasis let me put my emphasis in plain language i believe the one that existed before the world is a whole lot more real than you and i right now or anything you can do when i go back and think about in his mind i'm going back there and looking at the great eternal god amen you say do you think these things are real yeah they there's we don't need no cars when they get there but what if you push a button and go now we're in the space age when you can do different things you know what does that beam me up so what says yes scotty beam me up you know this in the space you and he go all the way up to the top floor and walks out you know i i'm not that dumb stupid they're not that dumb but i'm saying one thing for certain whatever being that you would want to call god heaven help me no words to express it he's more real than anything you and i could ever think of and he always was that you think of these uh things that they do and they put it into science and fiction movies you know where people can just run through walls they can do this they can do that and when you get through thinking about all that just remember every one of them can be stopped with a bullet but what about one who always existed he wasn't sitting back before the world well i wonder what's going on i don't know a split second he comprehended what he wanted to do i emphasized i had a split second in a split second he had it all into being he didn't have to sit down there well i wonder about this i wonder about that what should i do here what cause his first decision was the right decision ever how he made the world was the way he wanted it that's right ever how he made man was the way he wanted it he didn't have to figure it out he didn't have to sit down and think it over he was almighty god amen think on these things let's get one more all right go ahead number 28 it's the next one yeah 28. no now no one has seen god okay because god is a spirit now now talk about bodily form god is a spirit all right now the next thing we begin to see by eyes of supernatural looking we see a little white light forming out there what is that that was called by bible readers logos or anointed or the anointing or as as are the as i have was going to say the part of god began to develop into something that human beings could have some type of an idea what it was it was a little light low a little light moving he that was the word he that was the word now god gave himself birth to his son is that a second person no this is when he condescends which was before there was even or not adam in there or to error to make the adam that was jesus said glorify me father with the glory that we had before the foundation of the world way back in yonder not giving birth to a son as a second person about it think about what he's saying that what he's doing he's explaining that he's coming forth there was a time that he could not be comprehended and then gradually he begins to unfold to make himself known until one day he stands on the earth as a child all the way into a human form the great eternal god he's the beginning of the creation of god and you know what we are the prophet says we're the continuation of that creation we've got the quotes we're the continuation of that creation so however how he comes that's the way we come now remember he never sent a son he came himself all right what are you a child of god is god made manifest in another form amen a child i'm a child of god amen so i'm gonna manifest in another form what to look like to act like and to do like and to pull it all and do it all but yet still listen god never sent a son he came himself calling jesus on the scene in body he was a man in spirit he was god that was almighty god in human flesh almighty god stood on earth in human flesh no he was a son of god the human body had to have a creator to create it but the spiritual man was inside of there was almighty god that's why i differed with the brothers when they kept bringing all that about the river jordans and the things like that you know and saying he wouldn't god until the river jordan and now he was born to emmanuel he was born lord to christ i just couldn't see what they were talking about and i still don't see what they're talking about understand wordings that they're saying but i don't understand why they would try to bring something like that right but around said a little jehovah what about a prophet look down and see something like that and he said little jehovah crying in a cradle said little jehovah with no teeth he could just keep going back little jehovah the same one that walked on the shores of galilee the same one that stood before the world ever begun and said let there be i enjoyed one time that i mean i didn't all of them but we we used to go down to the uh what was it called the passion play or what was the name of it yeah and uh we used to go a lot and i enjoyed it and one time that they they had the scene and that was the best of all i've ever seen because it showed like a whirl and rock you know things and just like and here stood a man you know let's play but get the point here's to the man and he said let there be things started bursting and bombs et cetera you can call it you know things started coming into being and forming this and forming that the next scene a little baby laying in the crate that was the same one that created amen the same one it said let there be was now laying in the cradle i said somebody caught the point you know i understood it they said it they could never use that no more because it was somebody they got a what you call it they got a copyright on to that and they could never use that again by anybody else it's a good point because that's who that was that one that was standing before the foundation of the world was almighty god not a human element flesh almighty god and he turned and said let there be he just kept speaking it until he finally come to mind he said okay now we've got it up to here we can create this we said i got to do a little different here so we had to create a spirit man was that spirit man somebody else no that's what the point is when that man just for adam alone now adam and eve they were the only ones that had eternal life in their soul back there you don't don't bring it on down to cane or nothing like that because sin entered the picture and took it away but there they were there that eternal god stood on earth in a form put that into human flesh you got adam put that into jesus christ you've got almighty god made benefit put that into the bride of christ you've got the beginning of the creation of god and we are the rest of that creation think on these things come on musicians think on these things i just wanted to make a point then we'll back up see because when you think about it it's going to be like three stages it's up from there up to the word the creator from the word creator up to jesus from jesus up to you and i and it'll bring it forth let's stand together anybody have a need the altar is open i'm just trying to express the word beginning it's not like we say well that's the beginning well i had to begin it where to have a beginning it took thousands of years to get an airplane here but it had a beginning way back under sure but it finally got here it took god thousands of years to bring his church into being what you got here she's here now she's the beginning of the creation of god herself go ahead brother what we got in the presence [Music] what about it [Music] see the eternal life that you have inside of you right now never had a beginning that's a part of god [Music] [Applause] it had a time that it didn't exist in the situation the way it is now yeah but not a beginning god never sent a son to die he came and [Music] said god oh my [Music] amen [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] us god oh my god [Music] it was all meant to come out to the right place for people to be able to say that they could see you making yourself manifest in your people and things can't
