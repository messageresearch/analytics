[3:08] old thing in what are people see they're
[3:12] marking their s yes they're marking
[3:15] their s the mark of the beast we know is
[3:16] on the inside but look at the marks that
[3:18] they're taking on the outside even even
[3:20] older people good grief older people
[3:23] what about the men that have the big old
[3:24] ring oh I know in their ears think about
[3:27] 30 years from now when your ears do get
[3:29] big and floppy and what's going happen
[3:32] well what I think is uh what what are
[3:35] you going to do when you get tired of
[3:37] that when you realize how stupid that is
[3:40] then you got big hole hanging down in
[3:41] your ear right you know God can look
[3:44] over that but it's always going to be
[3:46] there it's a mark yeah and and they just
[3:48] mark their body and that's what they're
[3:50] doing they're marking theirself for
[3:52] Destruction um some of those people
[3:56] don't have a
[3:57] clue and Deuteronomy somewhere I got got
[3:59] it marked in my Bible that don't put ink
[4:01] in your body so so it's scripturally
[4:05] wrong but you look and you say my Lord
[4:08] that group of people 20 years from now
[4:10] is going to be our doctors our lawyers
[4:12] our politicians our
[4:16] president and look at the mindset they
[4:18] have now and then take it 20 years from
[4:20] now that's why I hope we're not here 20
[4:21] years from now tto 5 years from now 3
[4:25] years from now I hope we get out of here
[4:26] sooner than that tattoos is in Leviticus
[4:29] I don't want them in power 19 lenus what
[4:33] 1928 lus 1928 talking about marking on
[4:37] your body but let's go and go into
[4:39] Revelations chapter 6 now we're on the
[4:41] second seal let's get our mind back
[4:44] together on what we're doing um second
[4:49] seal will be the this will be the third
[4:52] one third part so let's just kind of go
[4:55] over everything let's read it and then
[4:56] we'll go over what it is and then let's
[4:58] get into the Char characteristics of
[5:00] that seal all right chapter 6
[5:04] verse excuse me verse
[5:07] three and when he had opened the second
[5:09] seal now I want you to look everybody's
[5:11] complaining or wondering whether the
[5:14] seals are open or not the Bible says
[5:15] they're
[5:17] open the Bible says they're open right
[5:20] the prophet of God said they're open
[5:22] Jesus said they were open because he
[5:23] preached six seals in in in the Book of
[5:26] Matthew so that's public domain that's
[5:29] something that is out there for you to
[5:31] see all right so let's don't uh like I
[5:34] said before I can't give you a
[5:36] revelation only God can do that that's
[5:39] right but you do have to hear it first
[5:43] right you do have to meditate on it you
[5:45] do have to study on it all right and
[5:48] when he had opened the second seal I
[5:50] heard the second beast say come and see
[5:52] now who's the second beast second beast
[5:55] is what the ox all right so it's the
[5:58] let's get in our mind that it's the ox
[6:01] this is the ox age Ox time it's that
[6:04] fourth Church age the Dark Ages all
[6:07] right sacrifice an ox is a burden Bearer
[6:10] an ox is a laborer all right so this
[6:14] church age was the longest Church age
[6:16] they labored for 1,500 years under Roman
[6:19] rule all right so it's the longest
[6:21] Church age and that it took that op to
[6:23] get them through
[6:24] it now what a cheetah can run faster
[6:27] than anything but it can only do it for
[6:28] a short distance
[6:30] right all right but an ox well who won
[6:33] the race the turtle of the hair right
[6:35] the turtle won because he was consistent
[6:37] same way with an ox an ox can work all
[6:39] day a cheetah might work for 10 minutes
[6:41] running 65 M hour but an ox and that's
[6:44] what happened that's I want you to get
[6:45] the spirit of that age the spirit of
[6:48] that age was sacrificed sacrificial
[6:50] burden
[6:51] bear and when he had opened the second
[6:53] seal I heard the second beast say come
[6:54] and see and there went out another horse
[6:58] all right another what what power all
[7:01] right another power and what was that
[7:04] power it was a red
[7:06] horse power was given to him that sat
[7:09] thereon which is who Satan Superman
[7:15] right cuz
[7:17] remember the first church age or the
[7:19] first three Church ages and the first
[7:21] seal it was a spirit it was a saying it
[7:24] was a deed now it's becoming a Doctrine
[7:27] we're after NAA we're now where Rome
[7:29] home church and state comes together and
[7:32] the power of church and state is
[7:34] together in this fourth age and look
[7:36] what you
[7:37] got now I know most of you know the
[7:40] history but for some of you that don't
[7:43] Constantine was a Roman General
[7:46] Constantine was a Roman what you say a
[7:49] government
[7:51] official instead of he sees this
[7:53] religious order coming up and he sees
[7:55] all this political power he says man if
[7:59] I can get get these two together well
[8:00] see that's Satan M cuz we know that's
[8:03] not right now but they they got the
[8:06] religious power which had power of what
[8:10] listen to this the
[8:11] people religion all religion can't be a
[8:14] religion if there's no people that's
[8:16] right right that's right you can't have
[8:18] a an end time believer message without
[8:21] having what end time Believers that's
[8:23] right so he saw a group of people that
[8:27] had religious power
[8:29] they could sway the people but they had
[8:32] no
[8:34] money and we get into something here
[8:37] think think with me they had the
[8:39] spiritual power but no
[8:42] money Constantine saw the government of
[8:46] Rome being hated by the
[8:49] people see how Satan how but it would
[8:51] sound good if you were sitting in a in a
[8:53] meeting and saying hey we got all this
[8:56] money power but the people hate it us if
[9:00] we can make those two
[9:02] one we got this whole thing with so
[9:06] that's what happened Constantine brought
[9:08] Church power set them down he brought
[9:11] political power set them down and what
[9:13] they done was they put them together
[9:15] instead of building fine churches they
[9:17] took the I mean instead of building um
[9:19] you know all these buildings they just
[9:21] took the churches and done what what is
[9:24] the church what even even back in Luther
[9:26] Wesley and even up until about 100 years
[9:28] ago go the church was a central location
[9:31] it was the courthouse it was the
[9:33] Postmaster General it was all it was the
[9:35] schoolhouse the church served many
[9:37] purposes all right so what Constantine
[9:40] did he brought this and he brought this
[9:42] and he put them together and he said
[9:43] look you people got power of the people
[9:45] you people got power of the of the money
[9:48] put them together so what did they do
[9:50] they put them together and they said
[9:52] okay now it's the
[9:54] holy see it was Roman
[9:56] Empire holy church
[10:00] bring them together makes a Holy Roman
[10:03] Empire which it wasn't nothing holy
[10:05] about
[10:06] it okay but it came into the guise of a
[10:11] holy if we can bring something holy
[10:14] White Horse white righteous
[10:17] church still the devil had some good
[10:20] people in
[10:22] it really brother Bri said the bride
[10:24] went to n and got and got deceived why
[10:28] because they didn't have enough word to
[10:29] keep them brother Bown said they should
[10:30] have never went right and I believe some
[10:33] of the older ones didn't go I believe
[10:35] some of the newer ones maybe the little
[10:37] babies got caught up in it but you take
[10:39] that power and bring the Roman power
[10:41] make it a holy Roman church or Holy
[10:44] Roman Empire then you start taking down
[10:46] see the Roman Empire they believed in
[10:50] what gods and
[10:52] goddesses watch How It's come in the
[10:53] Roman Catholic Church Gods and Goddesses
[10:56] they put up their statues of of ashtor
[10:58] and and Cupid and um names the more Thor
[11:03] and Zeus and you know you can just name
[11:06] a whole bunch remember read back in
[11:08] history when we were sitting in school
[11:10] we were reading about all this that was
[11:12] going on not knowing that that had an
[11:14] implication to us in this end time right
[11:18] because they brother brand said they
[11:19] took down
[11:21] ashor and put up Peter took down Jupiter
[11:25] put up Paul took down this one and they
[11:28] didn't take it down they just said oh
[11:29] well now that's
[11:31] Peter now that's instead of ashtor now
[11:34] it's
[11:37] Easter asor eastor you ought to read
[11:40] read Hop's Two Babylons or get you some
[11:43] old Roman history and read how that and
[11:46] it was very
[11:48] subtle he brought the religious power in
[11:51] and the religious power said
[11:53] hey let's put these holy men up
[11:57] Pope Austine of Hippo
[11:59] pope then they said oh Peter was our
[12:02] first pope because see these people
[12:04] these holy people which they were holy
[12:07] people they said hey Peter was a great
[12:10] man Paul was a great man and these
[12:12] people said well we don't know who these
[12:13] people are we heard they were Heretics
[12:14] and whatever when you bring them
[12:17] together what does the Holy Roman Church
[12:19] do now they do the same thing they put
[12:21] up their statues of Mary and and uh St
[12:24] Christopher and and St Patrick and St so
[12:28] and so and right right and they pray to
[12:31] them right instead of praying to God M
[12:34] these people were praying to God these
[12:36] people were praying the
[12:40] gods right brought them together and
[12:42] said okay
[12:44] now okay you can have all you want but
[12:47] we're going to have a father Son and
[12:49] Holy
[12:51] Ghost
[12:52] three separate
[12:55] Gods then that they're like oh no no no
[12:57] no no but remember remember n see the
[13:00] whole program was was Jesus the
[13:03] substance of God or a like substance now
[13:05] making him a like substance made him
[13:07] another person like they're doing now
[13:09] same Roman Catholic spirit is in this
[13:12] message making Jesus a separate identity
[13:14] from God another person and then he
[13:17] became God see how Satan just rides
[13:22] right through the people and they just
[13:24] praise God and and and and say well boy
[13:28] that's exact L right well it's not it
[13:31] was the same thing they argued about in
[13:33] the fourth Church age whether Jesus was
[13:35] the same was the substance of God thank
[13:38] you are a like substance of God well
[13:40] they came up with a like substance why
[13:42] would they come up with a like substance
[13:45] so they could put up asor and Jupiter
[13:49] and say well these people are
[13:51] intercessors to Jesus because Jesus is
[13:54] an intercessor to God and Jesus is our
[13:58] intercessor but we know he's almighty
[13:59] God he don't have to turn around and
[14:00] talk to another person right he's the
[14:04] one we go to for everything all
[14:06] sufficient God Almighty in human flesh
[14:09] right and there went out another horse
[14:12] that was red and power was given to him
[14:14] that set there on to take from the earth
[14:18] that's exactly what they were doing take
[14:20] from the earth what look not the round
[14:23] ball of earth right here this guy if you
[14:28] got the
[14:29] people you got it
[14:31] all cuz you see and now you got
[14:34] political power in in our governmental
[14:36] system now we know America said to keep
[14:39] church and state separate but now in
[14:42] other places and coming and evolving the
[14:44] people were the politics and the
[14:46] politics got into into religion and
[14:48] religion got into politics and that's
[14:50] basically what you got now right and
[14:52] that's just going to get worse and worse
[14:54] because see like it
[14:56] started right it started that way it
[15:00] separated a little bit in the church
[15:01] ages but guess what it's going to do
[15:02] it's going to come right back down to
[15:04] that
[15:05] same holy man the Antichrist holy man
[15:10] standing and being the
[15:13] intercessor so everything you get you
[15:15] got to get it through this man but he's
[15:17] the Antichrist but he's going to be very
[15:19] religious he's going to be very powerful
[15:21] just like he was the first
[15:23] po all right keep those things in your
[15:26] mind because as we go along but look
[15:28] what to take s on him to take peace from
[15:32] the earth what happened
[15:37] was the people got so
[15:41] confused now don't get me wrong Born
[15:45] Again Christians can be confused that's
[15:47] right we're going to talk about that
[15:48] this afternoon just like we talked a
[15:50] couple weeks ago about about the the the
[15:53] form that we're talking in because we
[15:55] should be talking in a higher form than
[15:58] what the other the church ages are
[15:59] talking in because brother ran said out
[16:01] of the true seed will come a church out
[16:02] of the true seed let's just say right
[16:05] here we got 30 people sitting here all
[16:07] right let's just for an example I'm
[16:08] going to use
[16:09] myself out of all this true seed you're
[16:12] all going to heaven you're all born
[16:15] again Christian you're all doing the
[16:16] best you can but you can't get this guy
[16:18] out of the way peace can't come to this
[16:21] right here this Earth but peace can come
[16:24] to my Earth because I see what God's
[16:26] done for me okay so out of the true seed
[16:29] will come a seed not a different seed
[16:33] but out of that come out of her my
[16:35] people Brother Richard Wilson preached a
[16:37] message long time ago I never forget it
[16:39] the Bible says come out of her my people
[16:41] which we did we all came out of
[16:43] denomination but we got to come out of
[16:45] this message
[16:47] church we got to be a group separated
[16:49] out you say separated yes I didn't do I
[16:52] didn't say this the prophet said it he
[16:55] said out of the true seed will come a
[16:57] church that's right what who's going to
[16:59] take a body chain right these are going
[17:01] to die these are going to get a
[17:03] revelation and they're going to go up
[17:05] cuz somebody's got to come out of this
[17:07] that's right like I preached last
[17:09] weekend in U Oklahoma they who prophesy
[17:12] must
[17:13] die everybody that prophesies well you
[17:16] know what you're doing when you prophesy
[17:17] you're putting something to somebody
[17:19] else right if I prophesy and say sister
[17:22] Johnny uh you're going well what am I
[17:24] doing I'm taking the word of God and I'm
[17:26] giving it to her but what about me
[17:29] what about
[17:31] mean all those prophets that
[17:34] prophesied they died why they were
[17:37] looking for something to come right and
[17:40] unless we see something here that's been
[17:43] preaching
[17:44] it chosen in him if him is
[17:50] here let's stop I'll get into this
[17:52] afternoon sermon
[17:56] stop that would give you I just go do it
[17:58] for 30 minutes and then y'all sleep this
[18:03] afternoon but you see what I'm talking
[18:05] about to take peace from the earth we
[18:08] got to see that these seals is for the
[18:10] Redemption of the body this man right
[18:12] here has to be changed right being
[18:15] chosen in him we are changed inside
[18:18] that's right we're a new
[18:22] creation but this outside guy still
[18:26] lives in this earth this world
[18:30] right and only a small group is going to
[18:33] see it and that's
[18:38] okay all right let's go
[18:40] there power was given him that sat there
[18:43] on to take peace from the earth what did
[18:45] they do they started telling
[18:47] them listen to this they started telling
[18:50] them you're no
[18:52] good you can't get anywhere in your
[18:55] flesh you got to do Penance to the
[19:00] Catholic
[19:02] Church do away with your Bibles read the
[19:05] history read the history in that time of
[19:08] the fourth Church age they burnt
[19:11] Bibles they started preaching the gospel
[19:13] in Latin so nobody can understand it so
[19:16] they were saying
[19:18] you can't make it you are filthy you're
[19:22] dirty you believe in me though and I'll
[19:26] intercede for you
[19:29] cuz I'm the Holy One remember you get
[19:31] the
[19:32] wafer I drink the wine you get the body
[19:36] cuz your body is the one that needs the
[19:39] peace on Earth peace of the on the Earth
[19:42] takes PE takes peace from the earth so
[19:44] they took peace from the people
[19:45] believing that they were born
[19:48] again brother brandom said there was 68
[19:51] million Christians killed during this
[19:53] Dark Age he said Untold billions
[19:57] spiritually this was natur that's why
[19:58] that horse is red cuz it rode through
[20:00] the blood of those Martyrs remember
[20:01] we'll read it next Sunday the cup of the
[20:04] Martyr was full of what blood remember
[20:07] the woman on the Scarlet horse was
[20:08] holding a cup full of blood Bible says
[20:11] which was the blood of the martyrs what
[20:14] right here in this Dark Age K 68 million
[20:18] why because see it's coming back around
[20:20] that old spirit is coming back around
[20:22] again to where you deny what you're
[20:25] that's what they did they brought them
[20:27] up to the Catholic church and said you
[20:28] either
[20:29] deny that one God that you believe that
[20:32] water baptism that you believe or we're
[20:34] going to kill you because it's better to
[20:36] kill
[20:37] you take peace from the earth it's
[20:40] better to kill you in other words and
[20:43] let us do whatever we can to to get you
[20:45] through purgatory and get you into
[20:47] heaven that it is for you to keep living
[20:49] and believing what you believe all right
[20:52] and that's exactly true sister Anna
[20:53] shaking her head she know the Catholic
[20:54] Church go back they killed 68 million
[20:57] Christians
[20:59] Born Again Believers 68 million
[21:03] people and then Untold billions in their
[21:06] Doctrine so they'd walk in and say Hey
[21:09] you believe one God yes we believe one
[21:10] God well now what about this Jesus was
[21:13] he God or was he like God or was he
[21:15] become God or and then they start what
[21:18] getting into people's mind
[21:20] yeah and they take took peace from the
[21:23] people why cuz now you got to come to
[21:27] that church
[21:29] to do your Penance you can't
[21:31] pray to God you got to pray to the Holy
[21:35] Roman Church who praise the God for you
[21:38] see it's taking power away from the
[21:41] people the power was in the people in
[21:43] the first three ages there was a white
[21:45] righteous church that rode through there
[21:47] and then there there is a red church
[21:50] this red blood what
[21:54] sanctification right we'll get a little
[21:55] ahead of
[21:56] ourselves and and that they should kill
[21:59] one
[22:00] another this man didn't do all the
[22:04] killing have you read that I just saw
[22:06] that last Sunday or two Sundays ago when
[22:08] I was reading
[22:10] this and that they should kill one
[22:12] another you would think that it would be
[22:15] the power in this Pope or in this man
[22:17] sitting on this horse that he would do
[22:19] the
[22:21] killing he's separating
[22:24] himself he's now saying I'm going to get
[22:28] them to believe it and let them do the
[22:30] killing cuz I'm one man but if I can get
[22:33] a 100 men to believe like me they can
[22:36] kill 100 people I can't kill but
[22:38] one they can kill 100 that 100 can kill
[22:41] another hundred you you see what I'm
[22:43] talking about just like a cancer all
[22:45] right see and they that they should kill
[22:48] one
[22:49] another what when you're talking it's
[22:51] not moving well it was a minute
[22:55] ago I don't know let thing
[23:00] how about now hello hello hello hello
[23:02] hello
[23:03] hello hello hello hello hello hello
[23:05] hello hello hello hello hello the
[23:09] battery is
[23:10] gone you got another battery over there
[23:12] there might be some there I think a new
[23:15] one right there thank you for noticing
[23:17] now and not paying attention to what I
[23:25] saying guilty guilty I can say that to
[23:28] any of y'all the same not just her I'm
[23:30] not piing on her oh we
[23:36] know there we go thank you
[23:39] though all right it'll catch it on here
[23:41] anyway all right it'll go on there now
[23:43] but listen now that they should kill one
[23:47] another so what did they do a Doctrine
[23:48] went out you got you got sayings deed
[23:52] now it's a Doctrine boy when it becomes
[23:54] a
[23:55] Doctrine number one you got somebody to
[23:58] believe it that's right all right and
[24:00] when they believe that Doctrine guess
[24:02] what that becomes a part of them then
[24:05] what do they do they go try to give
[24:07] their Doctrine to somebody else right
[24:10] all right so that's what happened in
[24:11] this in this time that they should kill
[24:14] one
[24:15] another but see how it started though
[24:18] real
[24:19] innocent a saying a
[24:23] deed now it's said Doctrine brother Bown
[24:26] said law
[24:28] it's made a law so they made a law so
[24:30] now during this church age we got the O
[24:33] Spirit we're in the fourth Church age
[24:34] which is the Dark Ages they physically
[24:37] killed the people and spiritually killed
[24:38] the people now theyve taken peace and
[24:41] killed sword Doctrine so it's now a
[24:43] Doctrine you got a man remember they
[24:45] crowned a man in the first three ages
[24:47] they crowned a pope got him started then
[24:50] he began to what spew out his
[24:53] Doctrine his
[24:55] sword he had a sword then
[24:58] see Gabriel Michael had a sword the word
[25:01] of God right now you got an
[25:05] impostor standing there with a
[25:09] sword and we'll get into something a
[25:11] little bit later on that hold that
[25:13] thought but let's get let's finish this
[25:15] scripture and that they should kill one
[25:18] another and there was given unto him a
[25:21] great
[25:22] sword
[25:24] Now power was given
[25:29] I could be the most powerful man in the
[25:31] world but unless I got somebody to work
[25:34] with or through like brother randam said
[25:38] now watch he said you Pentecostals he
[25:40] said You' got the
[25:43] spirit right you got the spirit but you
[25:47] got no Doctrine in other words you got
[25:48] no word but you got the spirit right you
[25:51] fundamentals you've got the word but you
[25:54] don't have no spirit so you got word and
[25:57] spirit it he said it's like a man that's
[25:59] got a million dollars in the
[26:01] bank but he don't have no
[26:03] checks then you got me over there with
[26:06] zero in the bank and I got a stack of
[26:08] checks this High well you're not going
[26:10] to do it I can sit there and write
[26:11] checks all I want to but that million
[26:13] dollars is going to stay over here in
[26:14] this account but put the two
[26:18] together did you understand what I just
[26:20] said yes what did Satan do he took
[26:24] spiritual power and political power
[26:28] and put them together that's right you
[26:29] say oh that was wrong what does God do
[26:33] God takes the spirit and the word Len
[26:38] together so see Satan remember
[26:41] everything I'm telling you you remember
[26:44] God has already done
[26:46] something God's done the original
[26:49] Satan's doing something like
[26:52] that folks this is the whole if you
[26:55] don't get anything in this whole series
[26:57] get this one thing if you don't know the
[27:00] difference between God and the devil and
[27:02] the two works that they're doing you're
[27:04] deceived that's right now we we're I'm
[27:07] sure we're all deceived that's right
[27:09] because of this we live in a deception
[27:12] brother R said we live in delusion yes
[27:14] sir what a mirage right what does Satan
[27:17] do God comes over here you know for one
[27:19] thing for sure if God's
[27:21] moving you going to see what Satan does
[27:24] first cuz he's going to run out there
[27:26] and try to get ahead of God make a look
[27:27] better make it look prettier but
[27:29] remember one thing if this is already
[27:32] happening God has already started
[27:34] something right
[27:36] here
[27:38] right remember the prophet said he does
[27:42] it reveals it then makes it manifest
[27:46] he's already done it way over
[27:49] here does it reveals it makes it
[27:52] manifest now Satan he's done running he
[27:55] catches brother random read the other
[27:57] day no quot Claude was quoting to me the
[28:00] other day said brother random said that
[28:02] that God that Satan knows every time God
[28:05] is moving toward
[28:07] you remember he said if he said if I say
[28:10] I'm going to go do something pray for
[28:11] somebody he said the kids will start
[28:13] crying the phone will start ringing the
[28:15] car will tear up why Satan FS that same
[28:18] pull remember he is
[28:20] religious highly religious right let me
[28:24] put it one more way he's highly
[28:26] spiritual right
[28:28] yeah we say oh the devil's carnal he
[28:30] gives us all this car no he's highly
[28:33] spiritual but he leans it to the carnal
[28:35] that's right everybody understand that
[28:37] he's highly spiritual but he leans it to
[28:39] the carnal every time he wants to
[28:41] conquer this guy right here okay if
[28:44] you're already born again he can't get
[28:45] the inside so what does he want to do he
[28:47] want to kill the outside guy right okay
[28:49] so he does it reveals it makes it
[28:51] manifest all right so God's already
[28:53] started something by what taking the
[28:56] spirit
[28:57] and the word and put it together all
[29:01] right mechanics the word dynamics the
[29:05] Holy Spirit we can have
[29:07] Dynamics mechanics all day
[29:10] long which is this right
[29:13] here but if we don't have the spirit on
[29:16] that does no good it's just what dead
[29:19] letter Satan loves this let me hold this
[29:23] book up one more time Satan loves just
[29:26] this letters on a
[29:28] page but when that becomes here and he
[29:32] can't see this anymore he just sees this
[29:35] he sees the life live that's what scares
[29:38] him that's what scares say you quote
[29:41] Satan listen Satan was there when
[29:43] brother R said it the first
[29:46] time so guess what we can't find a
[29:49] secret book somewhere that Satan had
[29:51] read
[29:53] yet there's only one thing people that
[29:56] saves us from Satan taking over and that
[29:59] is that when you become born again you
[30:01] get a small portion of the mind of
[30:04] Christ that he can come down through
[30:06] there and he can talk to a little spot
[30:09] inside of you and get his word
[30:13] Quicken everybody understand that yes
[30:16] that's the only thing that saves us
[30:19] that's what saves us cuz Paul says we
[30:21] must have the mind of Christ if you have
[30:22] the mind of Christ then you have this
[30:25] all right cuz see they had they had uh
[30:28] in this well we already erased it the
[30:30] first three ages they didn't have a
[30:32] Bible they didn't have a quote
[30:35] book they were the Bible they were
[30:38] living it that's what's wrote about in
[30:42] the book of Acts it's the first three
[30:43] Church ages basically first one anyway
[30:46] first and second Church age you
[30:48] understand that but they didn't have a
[30:50] they didn't have a Revelations chap 6 to
[30:52] read in the first three ages even in the
[30:55] fourth age the fourth age of if you'll
[30:57] read read your church Agee book brother
[30:59] brandom said the spirit of that age was
[31:02] just to say you were a Christian and
[31:04] give your life walk right in willingly
[31:07] to the to the Lions and to the to the
[31:11] Dungeons and to the racks and to they
[31:13] pull them apart with with horses that
[31:15] was the willingness of that
[31:18] age cuz he didn't have any other word to
[31:21] to hold
[31:23] them but see you and I must look at this
[31:26] age and see that that's a part of us but
[31:29] not the whole part of us in this seventh
[31:32] Church age we get all the ages together
[31:34] because seven is
[31:35] completion right but we got to have the
[31:38] spirit of all those ages to get us out
[31:40] of
[31:42] here got to have it got to have the lion
[31:45] ox man and eagle and got to have it
[31:46] there in Ezekiel we're going to read
[31:48] maybe next Sunday we'll reading Ezekiel
[31:49] since we got two of the two of the
[31:52] animals
[31:53] out maybe next Sunday we'll read in
[31:56] Ezekiel just a little bit about those
[31:58] four combat beasts all right so now
[32:01] power was given unto him and he was
[32:04] given a great sword so what did he start
[32:07] doing he started preaching his
[32:09] gospel he started preaching his gospel
[32:12] and it it what did it do it killed 68
[32:15] million physically killed them brother R
[32:18] said that's why that horse was blood red
[32:21] cuz he rode right through the blood of
[32:24] those martyred Saints I I started Ed
[32:27] reading Fox's book of Martyrs one time
[32:29] and I couldn't finish
[32:31] it the things that they did that's on
[32:34] record this is not just hears sa the
[32:37] Catholic Church admits to killing them
[32:40] they admit to doing this to
[32:44] people but you know
[32:47] what we're all Roman Catholics unless we
[32:49] have the true
[32:51] gospel you can be Baptist Methodist what
[32:53] what's the difference in a in a in a
[32:55] Baptist and a and a and a a um Roman
[32:58] Catholic just brother R said there's two
[33:01] things the water baptism and the uh
[33:04] taking of the
[33:05] communion well water baptism they father
[33:08] son Holy Ghost Roman Catholic father son
[33:10] Holy Ghost same one just maybe sprinkles
[33:13] and and the other one
[33:15] baptizes but that communion but brother
[33:18] brandham said in the end time they'll
[33:20] come together and the Protestants will
[33:23] accept why they going to accept Mama cuz
[33:25] she's going to bail us out look at the
[33:26] price of gold who holds all the gold of
[33:29] the
[33:30] world the Roman Catholic Church is
[33:32] getting richer while the whole world is
[33:34] getting
[33:35] poorer I'm not talking about just
[33:37] America Germany's in trouble France is
[33:40] in trouble look at all those people
[33:42] Ireland's in trouble all that European
[33:45] Union everybody is going to have to bow
[33:47] and then guess what then the United
[33:49] States is going to say hey we got enough
[33:52] power military power we'll be your
[33:55] second hand right-and guy you bail us
[33:58] out we'll police the
[34:00] world and that's your image to the Beast
