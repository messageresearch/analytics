clap for praise good to be here in the middle of the week if your God's not real I got one I want you introduce I want to introduce him to you yeah we we got a living God we got a God that can do what he said he was going to do we just got to trust him all right put it in his hands Brother John let him he's perfect I don't know if y'all know that or not God's perfect whatever he does it's always right and we'll get into something just a little bit um that really struck me yesterday as I was thinking about it and you know God doesn't make a mistake right right every move he makes is calculated already seen it so he he weaves everything to his to his plan and purpose right every one of these Church A's Messengers were we talk about brother brandham you know being a prophet we know he was a major prophet and and Paul was a major prophet and the ones in between were reformers but brother Adam calls them all prophets he calls them all prophets so they'd be prophets but God that's God we didn't just have the voice of God in this age they had the voice of God in Paul's age cuz it was God telling a group one group of people that little circle up there that group of people in Ephesus and they're the only ones to catch that dream or that Vision or whatever whatever it is that that Paul was preaching they were the only ones that caught it you and I are the only ones that's going to catch the truth of this message only ones and and that's not something I'm trying to exclude God did that God excluded the trash and brought the Bride As I was telling y'all the other day you know God does speak to other people but you know I can speak to um the sister Alicia or or to U Anna my sister or speak to Sister Julie or somebody and I can speak to a sister but I'm not going to speak to them like I speak to my wife God speaks to his wife different than he does to other people amen he whispers secrets to us that's what I was getting yesterday oh man he whispers his secrets to us just us you know why because you and I will listen God called a lot of people many are called but few are chosen you and I are the chosen group of people to see this thing to the end so God bless you we love you with the love of the Lord thank you this past weekend we had a wonderful time with the with the brothers there with brother Tim and brother Solomon um I believe they did a good wonderful job and all of you did a wonderful job uh feeding everybody and we had plenty of food and I thank you so very much that you um took out your time Friday and Saturday to help us out uh now to Sunday we announced having a baptismal service sister Harmony is going to be baptized well we have two more sister Lily where Lily at back s Lily she wants to be baptized and so does Anna Dale now not my sister Anna but Anna Dale the one married to Zach so she wants to be baptized so that's three tomorrow taking off work tomorrow try to get that pool hot enough to to where it won't be so cold but we'll get it done and clean it out cuz it needs to be cleaned out because of the sitting through the winter time so uh just pray that we get it all done but three so far Three's a good number but I like five I like sevens praise the Lord we've done it before remember but now let me ask you a question next Sunday um excuse me next Sunday or this coming Sunday is H communion and foot washing uh plus we're going to have the baptismal service so would and we can't forego it till the next week because we having our men's meeting the next week and we won't have a second service for everybody so what if we first service like we did before I'll cut it real short and we'll take communion and foot washing and hey that'll get every ordinance almost the whole Bible right there with baptism too but let's do it um let's take communion and foot washing first service I'll cut it short and then second service after the second service we'll have a baptismal service for three right now what a way to start what a way to start a month what a way to start a year so we we appreciate that we appreciate God uh speaking through brother Aaron the other night because that's what sparked some to get baptized and then re-baptized it's it's just something that you put that state down and once you put it down you just go back to the devil and say look right there it is put the day on your calendar on your calendar on your physical calendar and and Satan can't read take it back to him show it to him that that's where I put my state down that's where I died don't resurrect that guy anymore no it's dead we're going to so we're going to have a a burial service this coming this coming Sunday all right but we're going to have a resurrection and also good to have brother Frank Brown Jr Franklin God bless you buddy he's from the Ohio group from the Lighthouse of Refuge up there in Ohio he come down through here to pick up a trailer in in Florida so pretty much can't get from Ohio to Florida without going through Georgia so he knew a group of people here so let's welcome him he's been here before so let's welcome him tonight that sister Tabitha's brother all right so that's Isaac's brother-in-law bless his poor heart so and he has a he has a a set of parents that are a hoot I love his parents they Frank and Sylvia they're just they're just a chuckle and we're trying to get them down here right trying to get them down here so let's pray for brother Frank he's got to go pick that trailer up he's coming back up through here and may stop bying Fellowship for a little bit and then take on off back to Ohio then he's got to go from Ohio to Texas right Kansas wow Kansas Texas he's got to use that trailer to move somebody so let's just pray that everything works out and also we've got all these other things brother John will be speaking on the 21st the afternoon for the financial peace part um uh this is an announcement that's fresh brother Andre head came by to see Dad him and his wife um last

heads dear Lord thank you for this day thank you for an opportunity to stand before your purchase possession your bride the Bride of Jesus Christ father thank you so much for an opportunity Lord to speak to them Lord and for you to speak through US Lord may we move out of the way and you take over just for a little while father you do the speaking Lord and Lord help our ears and open our eyes that we can see you and hear you Lord we pray that you'd be with the ones that are sick that are not here Lord be with the ones that are on the highways of traveling Lord and and be with the foreign missionaries Lord we thought about them today a lot and we sure appreciate them and and miss them so father we pray that you'd bless us and be with us take care of us in further in the service in Jesus name amen we didn't really all get into the samon church age but with this will be part two and can anybody see that should be able to all right Revelations 1:10 say I was in the spirit on the Lord's day and heard behind me a great voice as of a trumpet how many of you have heard the voice you heard the voice in your day all right you heard and that was what it was the voice of God it was the voice of the son of man speaking and John turns and sees saying I am Alpha and Omega the first and the last what thou seest right in the book sent it to the seven churches Asia Ephesus Smurda pergamus thti Sardis Philadelphia Lea he saw the son of man standing in the candlesticks and I turned to see the voice that spake with me being turned I saw seven golden candlesticks and in the midst of those seven candlesticks one liken to the son of man clothed down to the foot down garment down to the foot and GED about the PS with a golden girdle I'm getting ahead of myself cuz I like I appreciate what the brother said about the star i' never thought of it that way that star in Bethlehem it didn't show the star the star showed them where Jesus was so that's what the stars that seven stars that that that that brother bradam saw those seven stars as seven men the Bible says it was seven men so there were seven men destined for each age and that was a mouthpiece of God and they didn't show their self they showed Christ they LED them to Christ and they and brother R he led us to Christ all right he had in his right hand Seven Stars and out of his mouth when a sharp two-edged sword you can be seated Lord add his Blessing now today we're going to get to Revelations 2:8 to the angel of the church in smrna right these things sayith the first and the last now watch this we want to get into this in a minute which was dead and is alive you think that's strange it is strange you and I started alive and then we died whoever this person is they died and then now they're alive ah I Know Thy works and tribulation now watch he didn't say I'm going to get you out of your tribulation he didn't say I'm going to get you out of your poverty he said I know what you got to go through I know that you're going to go through problems I know that you Lula church is going to go through problems God knows that but remember for our character building even Christ had to go through things that he suffered to be made perfect and so were you and I I you know what I don't hate it I I thought the other day I said man I just hate that we have to be all beat down but listen you and I have to be led by a chief Shepherd not me Lord Jesus Christ all right and to be led by Lord Jesus Christ he said if you're not chastened you're a bastard child in other words so you're not one of mine so now we but what does that do that doesn't keep God in line right it keeps up Us in line keeps us going in the right path all right and we're just that way we're we're we're hard-headed sheep well pray for me sorry about if y'all are not I am pray for me June raised her hand why'd you do that for and I and I know the blasphemy of them which say they are Jews and are not we'll get to that in a little bit maybe later next service but are now look he didn't say but are of the synagogue of Satan look at that how it's worded it says but are the very synagogue of Satan right not all the synagogue not going to the synagogue they are the synagogue of Satan fear none of these things which Thou shalt suffer behold the devil shall cast some of you into prison that you may be tried and you shall have tribulation 10 days look be thou faithful unto death and I will give thee a Crown of Life he that hath a near let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches he that overcometh shall not be hurt of the second death you and I die here right all right the second death is going to White Throne judgment that's all right so now let's remember as in alwayss I want to keep telling you this because I want you to see the pattern and know that and you say this is kind of silly I want you to know that brother Brandon was the seventh angel messenger I want you to know that by what by the characteristics uh we've had some you know had some people uh debate and and not only uh just recently but it's always been they said well now if brother ran was a prophet show him to me in the Bible right we see him all over the Bible as a messenger as Luke 1730 as Malachi 4 all the different ones and we see that and it's revelations 10:7 in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound but some people want to know exactly I want to see a name well your name's not in that book either verbatim but you in Christ you're in every verse that all right so I want you to see that God sent us a prophet I want you to see that God sent us a star to point us to Christ everything we do everything we when we get up into The Spar of of of of U statue of perfect man maybe not so much but the seals and and revealing of the son of man remember it's Christ that died for us without him we don't have a revelation we thrive on Revelation and that's what I said about the bride the bride loves Revelation and she receives Revelation because it's a secret to the world have you not tried to explain the godhead and that's another one you know they want to find brother Brown name in the Bible find the word Trinity in the Bible it ain't there if you want to find verbatim words but I go back to this one quote where Jesus stood one day and he said I thank you Father I thank you Father that you have hid this from the wise and prudent but revealed it to babes such as would learn in other words if we start right we'll end right if we start as babes realize we're Bab realize sometimes that we did things wrong and that we need Grace But realize that and don't say well bless God I got Grace and now I just get greasy all over again no that's greasy Grace no but listen God gave Grace because he knew we' sin that's right we'll get into that later on up into the church ages he knew that he knew every one of us were going to S every Church agent was going to have a messenger that was going to pour his heart out and then that message was going to be turned down and it was going to be refuted so much to where God had to send another Messenger to pick that message up bring a new one not a new one you understand what I mean but bring another one for that group of people cuz we believe God's a dispensationalist right amen and you know what we can understand him by being dispensationalist we can understand how God works by being dispensationalist amen so there's an announcement in heaven I'll get through with this C drop in a minute out of the mind of God comes to logos and I want you to understand something we'll look at in just a minute irenius I've been reading really deep into into many different commentaries of of irenius man he was he was a powerful powerful um and and we can say Theologian if if I may but he was the Holy Ghost fil Theologian he was a church age messenger so God give him he even we'll read it here in just a little bit through the history there was a disputation that there was more than four gospels because you got the book of mccabes you got another book over here you got the book of this one the book of that one irenius thank God irenius is the one that sat down and said no this is Matthew no this is Mark no this is Luke no this is John there's your four gospels so that's kind of how God weaved him into and he also had a very good um interpretation of what the Lost was and we'll get into it in just a minute because remember brother Brown didn't bring the word logos logos has been from a long time theologi called that it was the logos back before the foundation of the world way before brother rman got here all right so there was an announcement in heaven out of the mind of God comes to logos a sealed up message is open something that maybe has never been heard before ain't that familiar ain't that familiar has somebody been witnessing to you and you say all right now where'd you get that at where'd you get that I've read my Bible all this time and where'd you get that at oh let me tell you about this prophet in the end time I'm not ashamed of the having a prophet in the end I'm not ashamed of this gospel that he brought I'm not ashamed to call his name that's right that he helped me to get to Christ he was the Star Messenger that clarified listen not only who Christ is but where he's at he's in his bride he's not out there somewhere he's in his bride he's working in his people and brother bram's whole message he comes down he he comes where brother Tim read it she is him I now call you bride you see him honing all that all that away that maybe even Martin Luther couldn't say that he said the just shall live by faith and he preached a powerful message to get them out of Catholicism from crawling in on on sticks and stones and rocks he said hey the just shall live by faith so there's a mystery unfolded same with Luther and same with Wesley to the star of the age or the messenger picks up the logos of God we were talking about matching pieces really realize what God's done for all of us every Church age God has sent a person with a message separated him from everybody else polycarp was wonderful and he was great to be with probably was a a a good um teacher and probably was a good spokesperson because everybody loved him if you read about P the carp I mean he was he was well known and then of course his death is well known also but he wasn't picked as a church a me putting everything together under a different head so there's a trumpet sounds a messages proclaimed in other words our trumpet as we'll get to in in leosa our trumpet sounded sin in 1947 there was a message proclaimed brother R stood and he said hey we've got these new gadgets that were using recording on wires and recording on on great big 45 and and 78 records you know at first then they went with the tape player but that message was proclaimed a church age begins a distinct and declared message I want you to understand something brother random comes remember in the lap over so irenius has got to come in the lap over read it in just a minute but brother Brown comes in the laugh laap over from Methodist or the Wesley age into Pentecost from Pentecost into the message of the hour and it took him from 47 to 63 to try to turn us back to that faith that was in the that was in the first church age that's how far we got away we got away from everything they stood for in the first church age because there was no denomination on every corter there was no water baptism name father son Holy Ghost there was no eternal hell there was no trinitarian Doctrine in that first church Age first second and third it got eroded toward the third age but that first age was pure it had the lion anointing l i o n bold so it starts a spiritual war think of brother brand him in 47 everybody loved him because he was just like the fishes and Loaves he you know he he he he packed houses out with with people sincere cuz they were sick and I thank God that he came along when he did because remember there was no cure for a lot of things that stood before him and a lot of people got delivered for leukemia cancer and all the different things that was going on during that time that that modern medicine had not touched yet and if they had just listened to him they'd have understood a lot of the other that was going on all right talking about it being a bruised cell and about how this was a spirit and it worked like this and man he was a master at telling you what was going on in your body but it starts a spiritual war the true word of God versus false Doctrine there's only truth and false not an in between all right so the messenger then brings his message he's laid away listen you can say what you want to remember God don't make a mistake if brother Ram was the Star Messenger for this age and none other he took him home in December of 1965 God did did I don't get no amen that was God doing that God took him home he was done he was finished there was nothing else for him to say God took him home he was laid away just as Paul got his head chopped off all the different Messengers listen this Holy Ghost Gospel you remember the song it's dripping with blood the blood of Martyrs and you and I are A persecuted group of people you just don't know it yet but when that squeeze comes they're going to turn against you your best friends that you've had for a long time maybe they're going to have to make a choice one day so are you so are you friends or the word of God world or the word of God that's why it could almost deceive the very elect if it were possible but it's not possible to deceive someone that way listen that way that has the Holy Ghost In other words that's to turn the word down because the Holy Ghost can't turn itself down the Holy Ghost has got to coincide with itself now you can be mixed up and confused and all backslid and all that other stuff but some people when they say I'm backslid you got to have something to slide back from hello somebody you look at them and say you ain't been on the mountain yet on cuz listen everybody we all go through the problems but it's how we rebound from it oh I'll just quit going to church cuz I don't feel well God didn't tell you that who told you that the devil so you going to do what he said all right so look people accept it or reject it it brings a temporary judgment what it brought to the Pentecostals they went right on they kept making denominations they just kept M filling the world fall of denominational churches after brother Brandon was taking off the scene but they're dead the prophet of God said they're dead they're like ljes moose LOD and all that other different stuff just got a membership so spiritual death but they think they're alive remember that girl he found in the motel you know she was half neaked and drunk she'd been on some kind of uh some kind of retreat and she comes down through the hallway and she said who be this is life and brother rown said she did not know that that was death what she thought was life was killing her same way with me and you what is life life is coming to church on Friday night and getting a good sermon amen so spiritual death to the ones who reject their messenger cuz remember who was it Samuel or of them yeah when Israel was looking for a for a King Samuel says have I not done all this for you guys have I not done this even brother Ram says have I not done this have I not done that I'm not asked for a dime I I I've prophesied and it's come to pass I took care of you I prayed for you yeah but we want a king and then remember Samuel goes and say God they turned me down what' God tell him no Samuel they didn't turn you down they turned me down so if you turn down the truth you're not turning the man that's bringing it down I don't care how he brings it if it's the truth you're turning God down that's right you're not turning the man down all right so now the next days there's an announcement in heaven it all starts over again but you and I the only announcement we get is we're going in a rapture we are the Omega bride we are the end of it all we get all the curses but we get all the blessings we get all the overcoming that's we have had a sealed up message that is opened by a prophet but we didn't just seal it back up and throw it in a closet God knew they'd be people they knew they'd be Messengers brother Tim cross brother Solomon young guy brother Bob brother Lise brother Aaron amen they could carry this thing further just keep going keep going with it listen if God started it he's going to finish you can say well I'll just stop that yeah try to stop god listen doesn't ever work I just want to give you a secret there it don't ever work try to stop god let's just get in as as the brother said let's just get in and help don't tackle the guy with a ball on your own team protect him protect us all we got all we all got problems but in the age of Pentecost 8030 there was a messenger that was the Holy Ghost and the reason I'm coming back to this you're going to see that really plain when we get over coming out of uh Wesley's message into Pentecost into brother rand's message there had to be an age of Pentecost to get a prophet in the end time end of the age to bring his message all right so we'll get to that so the alpha age was the Ephesian Church age Paul founded the church in Ephesus midcentury so the date of the Ephesian Church age started in ad 53 and went on to 170 Paul died around 64 to 67 so right in the middle of it he passed away the messenger went off the scene does that sound familiar so it just died went on and I mean it just fell apart and there was nothing else going on and well they just went back to the Pharisees and the Sadducees and they said oh we're so sorry we no they didn't they became more bold they became so bold they gave their life as Paul gave his life they gave their life for what they beli and listen they didn't have an internet so he can look up everything praise God Google brother brandham sometime no don't if you got any doubt brother R was a prophet of the end time there's a space right here for you it's called an altar to get your heart right he's gone I I like when Joshua remember when Joshua got his commission and God tells him say now look Moses thy servant is dead I don't think and I've got to go back and look but I don't think I ever in the whole book of Joshua he ever said now Moses said he never said that he had a commission to do what he was going to do and he went forward and done it quit looking back he went forward he knew though that he was built on Moses message but Moses wasn't Moses wasn't coming back God's pattern is when he takes a messenger he does not raise him back up so you can you can argue with God that's right we better get right what's now and we'll we'll worry about this Elijah coming back out of the Grave when this message is fulfilled and a group of people called a bride not one person anymore all right so now we look at this and we see that we've kind of um I'm I'm sorry and apologize uh but I think Dad did this first and then brother Joe and the different ones put those red in there when he preach we preached on the porter he did too where you can see that there was a Pentecostal age over here we just saw that the Holy Ghost fell ad30 Peter was a spokesperson not the messenger to an age there was not one because the Ephesian age Paul was the porter now remember when we read this remember a porter is a doorkeeper not the door so if you keep that separate then you'll know brother Rand wasn't God in the term that people think he's God he W brother BR wasn't the door Christ is the door brother Ram showed us how to get in the door but brother Ram didn't shove you through the door either he gave you a choice he said right here's the door this is the way through water baptism and receiving the baptism of the Holy Ghost and repent and and become Justified and Sanctified filled with the Holy Ghost that's what a porter does tells you what in the door and tells you all about that what's behind that door so that's what we're looking here we see all over in the very we see Paul so Paul comes at the end of the Pentecostal age brings his message see the ARA going up with Paul so now we're going to go through that just for a few minutes look at all that light that was that was just um and I don't understand uh how in the world they got all that to everybody because they didn't have social media they didn't have phones they didn't have this that we're looking at today it was word of mouth and somebody really they were subscribes that would would would not couldn't write a whole sermon because you can't sit there and have somebody say oh now wait a minute hold on what was that you said again listen the Holy Ghost was in these people you want me to prove it to you look at Luke Luke was not with Jesus not one minute and he wrote the whole book of Luke with perfect understanding he said he sat down and God told him what to write brother R sat down God told him what to write he told him one time said pick up your pen and write this down who was that for him no it for us so Paul comes at the end of the Pentecostal age brings his message a powerful message 80% of the New Testament and then what happens at the end he's going to tell us here in a second that Grievious wolves are going to come in we're going to have a santhus and all the different ones that's going to come in and dilute the word of God and then God's going to send an irenius here in just a second at the end of the Ephesus or Ephesian Church age in the lap over or the open door God's going to send ir readus and say hey here's the door I'm going to tell you a little more about it Paul told you about it but I'm going to tell you some more about it so we'll look at it in just a second so everybody got that and that pattern runs all the way because you had to have Elijah brother R came at the end of this age to bring a message wasn't 47 to 63 that was restoration that was trying to get them Pentecostal people out of that overlap everybody with me but when he finally finally in 1963 he said now the message begins then that's the Elijah that brings the message to who you and I that puts us into eternity praise God it's all perfect for some reason God's perfect I that's why I can put my dependency on that there is somebody perfect running the show there is somebody that does not make a mistake running the show but you know what we got to do we got to get to show not show him who you are show who he is through us all right the first trumpet sounded the first seal was tore loose Paul was a messenger what' he do he declared war on Orthodox Church what he was always with the Pharisees he was always in the temple he was always causing trouble then he brings a guy called Barnabas in then he brings Silas and he brings all these guys in and never they just hate them all they hate every one of them throw rocks at them try to kill them took a legion of of of Army and tried to find Paul God warned Paul they let him down from a a roof and down a wall and got him out of there God protects his message so he declared war on the Orthodox Church for not believing the Messiah sign that Jesus had produced to them why they should have have know it they should have know him remember Paul come at the End of the Age Now what's he talking about the end of Ephesus no he's talking about coming at the end of the Pentecostal age ad50 ad30 of her room all right all the messengers come at the end of the age it's at the end time when these things are brought forth John 10 verse1 so verely verely I say unto you he that entereth not by the door into the Sheepfold but climbeth up some other way the same as a thief and a robber see you can't try to get in any other way you can try but remember there was a scenario where somebody got found inside there he didn't come he didn't have the right garment on Jesus said kick him out he didn't come in the right way kick him out weeping wailing nashing of teeth but he that entereth in by the door can we just not do what God said that's right are we do we just be so contrary to what God Said the world is they're contrary did y'all see what happened on I'm sure the media didn't show this but Sunday was declared by our president as National transgender day yes look on the why House website wh.org and it says I Joseph Biden declare this day March the 31st which was Easter Sunday as National transgender awareness day to bring all of us together to understand them you can be a Democrat all you want to it's all filth but that the epitome of felt that is Sodom and Gomorrah all over again at the highest office from the White House and I'm sure somebody will probably try to take this off of YouTube it's okay with me but you didn't hear that on any of the national news because the national news is owned by the Democrats right and the Liberals but that was signed into law I think on like the 26th or something that the or somewhere before that that the 31st was going to be now now it will be national uh and I wouldn't be surprised if that wasn't one of my new holidays for the post office so have all them other ones well let's get off of that to him the porter openeth now Look to Him the porter opening so the porter the door's closed the Porter is the one that open opens the door all right and he calleth his own and the sheep hear his voice and he calleth his own Sheep by name and leadth them out and when he putteth forth his own sheep he goeth before them the Sheep follow for they know his voice like I said before the reason the Sheep know they know his voice but they also if they don't don't see him they sure can't smell him amen cuz the shepherd smells like the sheep and a stranger will they not follow but will flee from him for they know not the voice of strangers that's why when we hear strange Doctrine or something maybe a little bit off what is it do I hope I hope there's enough Holy Ghost inside of you to go hey wait a minute you feel that little check hey wait a minute let's look at this again don't jump up and say you false prophet no but you check it out I promise you that whole ho ghost is to lead you and guide you into what all truth amen not some truth all truth because the Holy Ghost does not know error only the devil knows error there is no error in God right it's Error in man so the Greek word for Porter is the one that keeps the door or door keeper or are a watcher God sent us in every age he sent a watcher he sent somebody like arenus to say hey this is what the truth is now cuz I'm going to read you some things about irenius that you can see Paul Paul said Grievous wolves he died in ad60 something well then now you got irenius he was born in I I I will look at it in a minute but his age was 170 to 312 we're heading toward NAA and what's happening already when arenus stands up he has to write a book called against heresy we'll look at in a minute he wrote a book on the whole thing of of of nosism which is many gods and whoever wants to be and all that not not one true Living God so the lap over brother R says look keep bearing in mind that these Church ages start now watch whatever is in that one Church age it goes all the way through every Church age so you're sitting here today going well that was just in the Ephesian Church age and that was just in the Smur Church age and that was just in the no it's sitting here today that devil hasn't died yet so every time you see the salutation oh Hallelujah but you better look and see where the one he said that hey you got a name that you call yourself but you're dead amen if you're not bride and you call yourself bride that don't matter to God you got to come the prescribed way to be bride let God call you bride right brother brandham look G through William brandham called us bride now look everybody in that congregation was not bride right sorry brother R said there's three kinds all right but he did speak to the ones that heard him the ones that heard him was bride they were elect he knew they would respond his brother T saying respond to it listen the word can be pure and unadulterated but if you don't respond to it you going to be held responsible if you don't respond to it hello somebody God's word won't return void if it goes out you can sit there with your arms folded all day long ain't for me ain't for me ain't for me well you better find something it is you better find something it is cuz it's getting late they we always call it redo ain't no redo sh that rhymed didn't it there ain't no redo we ain't got time for a redo we're going forward and this we were talking yes um Sunday brother R said they'll keep on after the bride no more gentille saved he said people will still go to church thinking they're getting saved why because they've been taught that oh just s in the message church and you're fine wait till brother Brown gets back cuz we don't know nothing that's hogwash you're lazy if you do that that's just lazy bunch of people what it is I'm just waiting waiting on what you get the Holy Ghost you'll be moving right so whatever's in that one Church age it goes all the way down through every Church age and each one of the church ages lap over one another it's like laps like laying over each other like these steps one right on top of the other and one Church AG is going out the angel or star that comes in between there is to call back that church to the faith it once lost it's always been that way and then I didn't see this but the book of Jude is right in the Book of Revelation right before the Book of Revelations all the other writers had died except Jude and John and Jude writes and says hey we need to earnestly contend for the faith that was once delivered from those people back over here and Paul and Paul and James and John and all I'm not John but Paul and different ones because John was the only one standing here on the a of patmas and Jude was right behind him so the lapping over between the apostles and the coming of the Book of Revelations because most apostles were dead then see it was gone on so what was Jude judee's the lap over between the writings of Paul and and different ones lapped over to get to the Book of Revelations there was one living at that time that was John the Divine he's the one that's writing what we're talking about tonight so now watch the angel appears right at the end time just at the end time to rebuke the church for it losing its first love and how it got away from God like they did down Through the Ages same thing the messenger does tonight the angel messenger comes back to rebuke them each age for what they had done so that makes a lap over and each one of the church ages just lap right over one another like that like coming upstairs it's laying in laps like that going up does everybody understand what I'm talking about and and then you know that's what I said that during that time it's Grace has God giv you Grace cuz you're stuck between the two some of those old Pentecostals were stuck between Pentecost but listen Pentecost was true hello somebody Pentecost when that Holy Ghost fell in 1906 in isusa street that wasn't a false holy ghost that was the real thing it restored the gifts I they may have had a baptism that was false or or trinitarian doctrine but God was dealing with that right then they were reformers but God sent a prophet to bring it back brother brandham listen he come to a point where I know if I'd have been in Pentecost I wouldn't have went and seen him anymore he rebuked them all the time what did he do then he rebuked the Pentecostal age just like Paul rebuked them getting away from Pentecost ad30 brother Brown said you've lost your first love you you've cabage down on this and that and the others speak in tongues and it doesn't matter how you live just speak in tongues right he said you've stopped you stopped and God kept going what' he do he kept going from the lap over into brother brandom tries to pick them up and bring them out of Pentecost is that not right am I not telling you the r he didn't want to leave anybody in there why did Paul go to the Sanhedrin why' Paul go to the Pharisees and sades he didn't want to listen he wasn't standing there just to say I'm Paul I'm Paul I know more than you do he want to get them people out that's what we all do we want to all get out of everything sin that we do all the different things we want to pull us out of that thing that's our job that was brother R's job he loved those people he said he hated the denomination but what loved the people hate to sin Love The Sinner that's what we're doing so Paul come at the end of the age and on down lap over of each age that's what makes it lap see to the angel speaking what it was this laps over here to the angel to the end of that age brother R what he's doing is he's going down through the Book of Revelations made the lap stair steps going up seven Church agents patma Vision now watch here's another you got to got to take this one too every evil that was in that first church lapped over into the next one just kept going on down till it finally ends up in complete apostasy in this day cuz remember there was a little light all the way through there and there's just a teeny bit in our day and remember it was total darkness brother R said I put that light in there you ought to be running aisles bro sis that was me and you that was a chance that we had to become the light of the age he put it there thank God for a prophet that stood in the Gap if it wasn't for Moses God would have killed all of Israel he said Moses get out of the way had enough of them yeah God gets mad you didn't know that God hates did you not know that Bible say he did God even repented he repented for making man knowing what they'd do he just can't stand sin though he can't stand to see it that's why there's a blood buffer even from us to him much less the world there's a blood buffer that he hears our voice saying God forgive me God forgive me for what I did and he knows whether you mean it or not that's right but every evil was in that first age lapped over to the next one just kept going on down until it finally ends up in complete apostasy in the last day but I want you to look where what happens is there's more churches on every corner than there's ever been and you you just wait something happened like 911 something something happened they'll all go start going back to church oh yeah and I I do know why that is but I really would it it's striking that it stays that way all the time it was proven here three years ago brother Dale had a stroke Church filled up next Sunday people crying want to come back where they at today what changed God don't change the Holy Ghost don't change quit fearing change our change to what to his perfection amen cuz remember we all are imperfect but we look to a perfect God so you just wait something's going to happen I'm probably when that tsunami happened in Japan they probably don't have no churches over there but if it would something happen you wait till California sinks on you won't be able to get in the church it'll be too late then don't try to come to Spoken Word Church it'll be too late there will be a Time folks when it's too late I'm not trying to scare you young people there is a time when not just that physical door is closed God will shut the door of the Ark and you can't get in and praise God we can't get out every evil just keeps lapping over in each age every little look ISM remember nism started in the first church age a saying oh we really don't need to go to church we're just going to wait till brother brandom gets back and I promise you there's a lot of people that wish he want that want him back they really don't cuz he'll start tearing their hide and they'll be going no that's really not him what' he do to Jesus we're looking for messiah we're looking for messiah we're looking for messiah we're looking for messiah and he came down he stood one day and he said what part of this Bible have I not fulfilled they killed him right said no you're not God you're the devil they call us that don't they we preached a little hard and they say oh he had a little Devil in him tonight I said tonight but there's great there's Grace in the lap over cuz what God does he sends a messenger to pull those people out of what they were falling into you see where that overlap was it was a thing it dipped down they pulled them out of there and praise God there was a group of people that came out of that that's right same way in the end time there's a group of people that caught the real message from Pentecost into the bride Age and and and brother Brandon was able to get some of them out some of them couldn't get out all right so look Revelations 2:1 to the angel of the Church of Ephesus write so remember that word is of and the word in leosa is of the rest of them are in excuse me the rebuke is if you lost your first love Paul was a messenger skip through here real quick now Paul and Barnabas wax bold we might ought try to do that every once in a while it doesn't hurt to be bold it doesn't hurt to know what you tell people what you know and not be boastful about it but tell them that how you candle got lit right but Paul and Barnabas waxed bold and said it was necessary that the word of God should first spoken to you but seeing you put it from you he's talking to the Jews all right and judge yourselves Unworthy of everlasting life L we turn to the Gentiles so that started now that didn't start the Gentile age it started on the day of Pentecost cuz 3,000 downstairs got saved and they weren't Jews but the but the big core of them was Jews up here but 3,000 downstairs wasn't all Jews you reading your Bible but there was a time when Paul listen every time Paul went to the Jews they stoned him boed him out right so he just quit going to them he said Lo we turn to the Gentiles for so hath the Lord commanded us saying I have S thee to be a light of the Gentiles that thou should us be for salvation to the ends of the Earth and when the Gentiles heard this and when the Gentiles for those of y'all that are asleep you're a gentile right and when the Gentiles heard this they were glad thank God and glorified the word of the Lord and as many as were ordained to eternal life they believed Romans 11:25 for I would not Brethren that you should be ignorant of this mystery lest you should be wise in your own conceit that blindness in part is happening to Israel until the fullness of the Gentiles become come in God blinded his own children just so that you and I could get in that's why he has P compassion on Israel that's why there is a fifth SE Jew that's why there is Jews that are going to be given eternal life just because of Jews just because they're Jews fif Ste Jew is just because they're Jew they're not Christians but they stood for who they were and God stood for them but he had to Blind them so that you and I could come in then what's he going to do when the Gentiles over age is over he's going to lift his hands go to the Jews and they're going to go oh my word we missed it where did you get those scars in other words we missed the whole Messiah deal and those two Prophets You know what they're going to do they're going to say look it looks bad I'm going to say look Church it looks bad sometimes it looks bad but those two prophets are Grace to that 144,000 he they're Grace to him and they're going to preach Grace to him hey you might have missed that but you're getting this and this is eternal life that's eternal life you missed that you missed being the bride but God didn't forget you oh what two witnesses I I don't think I'd love to be one of them because that's not they're not bride but to be standing there and watch them proclaim the message and their and the Jews their eyes just pop open they're like oh and then they like I said they they become so uh remorseful they're like well we're doomed we messed the we messed this whole thing up and then for the two prophets to stand in the pull pit and say look it was done for a purpose amen if you believe in this Lord Jesus Christ come to the altar we're going to pray for you to become a Christian a real Christian oh praise God listen God's so gracious he have to do that he have to do any of this but he did it for us Paul said if if any man preach any other gospel unto you that that you have received than that you have received let him be a cursed wow for do I now persuade men or God whoa or do I seek to please men Paul didn't do that for if I yet please men I should not be the servant of Christ he's also the same one that says have I made you my enemy because I've told you the truth probably one of brother Dale's most quoted quotes have you become my en enemy because I told you the truth but I certify you Brethren that the gospel which was preached of me is not after men listen the gospel brother bradam brought us was not of any other man he took pieces and parts sure but Paul took the Old Testament and he brought it alive in the New Testament and there was no other preacher could tell him any different there was no other preacher that could sit with him and teach Paul Paul went to the back side of desert he rolled the Scrolls up went back there and said God you call me for something this is all I got he didn't have one of these he was writing about that much of this but there was this much of it that was in Scrolls and he laid it out you know what the Holy Ghost said pick up your pen and write right pick up your pen and write I got something to say to my people those Corinthians may be all messed up but I want to tell them how to get unsed those Ephesians they're good powerful I want to tell them some real meat write this down we just happen to get it in tape and book form don't get quiet this this message is it folks I'm telling you you read all James doson you read all that stuff if you want to this message is it if it's not then we're just all deceived and we're all going to hell and I don't think that's going to happen amen but I certify you Brethren that the gospel which was preached to me is not after men for I neither received it of man neither was I taught it but by the revelation of Jesus Christ now look that was the first church AE messenger he said well I can get it just like he can get it no you can't you ain't Paul right Paul was a chosen vessel remember what God told anas That's My Chosen vessel you go pray for him receive the Holy Ghost I got to work for him now when God says he got to work for you that's why Paul was a prisoner that's why Paul either had bad eyesight or something was was buffing him every day he said God can you take this away from us it's really strange that brother R had about the same thing only he had a stomach issue praying for people that was throwing up and he said go back over there and eat you some potatoes go back over there and eat you some some Mexican food and he goes home and throws up it's a burden he beared for the people but now remember one day he was delivered of that that squirrel come out and he was over you see what I can't make it any more plain you see what people go through to bring you a message you look at all these great warriors they died to bring somebody a message brother Brown died to bring us a message brother Dale wore his body out bringing us a message but we got it we got the message we know I believe we we know where we're going we know what we're doing we know what God's doing I know that for sure but I look at Paul one day Paul he looked at a group of people he said now behold I know that you all among of whom I have gone preaching the kingdom of God shall see my face no more God was revealing something to him he wasn't coming back he said wherefore I take you to record this day that I am pure from the blood of all men wow can you stand and say that for I have not shown to declare unto you all the counsel of God take heed therefore unto yourselves and to all the flock over the which the Holy Ghost has made you overseers watch how he put Holy Ghost made you overseers not you made the Holy Ghost Holy Ghost made you overseer to feed the Church of God which he hath purchased with his own blood for I know this that after my departing shall Grievous wolves enter in among you listen Paul was a spiritual man obviously he could see that demon already starting he could see that thing all that Spirit already creeping into the church so he said Beware not sparing the flock look also of your own s he had some judases standing with him hello somebody he said among you shall men arise speaking perverse things to draw away disciples after them therefore watch and remember that by the space of three years I cease not to warn everyone night and day with tears and now Brethren I commend you to God and to the word of his grace which is able to build you up and give you an inheritance among all them which are Sanctified you have an inheritance tonight so remember the city of Ephesus we'll we we've already been through all that the city of Ephesus really when you start reading about it it basically is was the book end of what leot is now we thought it was we think it's bad here but we know it is but morally they were horrible over there too but that's where God chose for our Paul to set up to live for a little bit and set up the first powerful church at Ephesus in that chaos he's doing it now right in this chaos of what I just told you that our president did right that shouldn't shake you that should point you more toward Calvary that should point you more focused to forget about politics it's all rotten that's where John lived it's where Mary lived Jesus's mom they all went to that one place and lived and all that around them but yet they held their faith and it was cited that John came back and wrote The Three Little gospels and that Mary was there and they were all together in one house I think Julie and them were there right didn't you go to to Mary's house beautiful place I mean from the outside but they were able to see that and that's where Mary lived and John was there and U of course Paul died Rome but some of the other ones there and that first powerful Church got started there so I declare to you that the first that the the last powerful church is looking in front of me right now this is the last powerful church that will ever hit the face of the Earth you I don't know about that not up to you it's you to yield yourself yield yourself members yield your members to God don't do more as far as works I'm always careful of people that that try to work their way into heaven had a situation not too long ago I mean this boy he work work work work work work work work everywhere he went work work work work work well come to find out he was working on some bad stuff while he was working balanced Christianity is what we need to look for balanced Christianity not go over here on one side on the Wild Side on this side cuz usually if you're doing this you're trying to cover up something don't come to me and say I'll paint your house well somebody could if they wanted to keep me from having to do it I'm just kidding but no let's live the Bible says live Godly live live live to the Lord you know I I'm not the kind of one that I I don't want a birthday party ever every year I don't want a anniversary party I don't want a big old Christmas gift I ain't made for that I told y'all many many times before brother Dale would just rather have all y'all Born Again than to have any gift that will you ever give him but gift cards are good good way to start I'm just kidding but no I mean we don't we don't build kingdoms to our sou it ain't all give it to me give it to me we're servants when brother Bob gets up here he's a servant he what he's done is is the hour and whatever he's preaching he spent maybe two or three hours and then all during the week while we were doing other things come on somebody well and brother Dale while we were doing something he was up at 2:00 in the morning 3:00 in the morning trying to bring you just some content to get to you on a church service and you see it more I mean I see it more now that you got to stay in something you can't just have hazly do something when it comes to the word of God especially in the end time you got to be so precise because the devil's just on one little crack and he'll he'll slide right in there so you got to keep those cracks cinched up make sure like like you know I am like my dad in that way Dad tried to tear down doctrines and if he got a good one he tried to refute it instead of just going what that's it oh yeah that's see it right there buddy yeah that angel walked right through that wall and and told me to tell you all y'all are are you ain't got to do nothing but just believe the message and that's it and you're born again what if an angel walked through and told you the same thing brother Ram said that's bait for Pentecost that's a feeling I got an angel you got an angel all right he might not be a white one amen right if it's false Doctrine it's false Doctrine sorry Revelations 2:7 says he that hath an near let him hear what the spirit sayith to the church is to him that overcometh will I give to eat of the tree of life which is in the midst of the paradise of God Revelations 22:12 says behold I come quickly and my reward is with me to give every man according as his work shall be I am Alpha and Omega there's the beginning and the end the first and the last blessed are they that do these Commandments that they may have right to the tree of life and may enter in through the great through the gates into the city now you and I we know what the tree of life is it's not a literal tree they might be some over in the in the future home but the tree that was in the Garden of Eden was not an apple tree it was Jesus Christ and devil two trees good and evil tree of life that's what we're living by right now so look at at that first church age they were promised they could eat from that tree if you'll just persevere if you'll just overcome this is what you got looking you you're looking at this right in the face but you know what a lot of people turned it down so God had to send another church age a saman church age I forgot my R saman Church age Revelations 2:8 says to the angel of the church in Smyrna right these things sayth the first to last which was dead and is alive I Know Thy Works in Tribulation and poverty but thou are rich I know the blasphemy of them which say they are Jews and are not but are the synagogue of Satan fear none of those which Thou shalt suffer behold the devil will cast some of you in prison that you may be tried how many of us I didn't think so and you shall have tribulation 10 days be thou faithful unto death be thou faithful unto death can we hold on have we got what it takes to hold on because it is I'll give thee a crown of life eternal life he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith un the churches he that overcometh shall not be hurt of the second death now the word Smyrna means bitter or that's where the word m comes from smna it comes from the word myr which was used in inbombing the dead so this Mur in church age brother R said look the word Smyrna means also a bitter being derived from the word myrr myrr was used in inbombing the dead thus we have a twofold significance found in the name of this age it was a bitter age filled with Death Watch the two Vines within the framework of the church were drifting further apart with an increased bitterness toward the True Vine that's why bride don't fight bride if you got two people fighting okay all right right there's bitterness toward the True Vine on the part of the false death was not only the seed of false Vine but even in the True Vine now listen even in the True Vine there was a creeping paralysis and impotence because they had already drifted from the unadulterated truth of the first few few years after Pentecost now watch and no True Believer is in I like to put this in red no True Believer this is Brother Brown no True Believer is any stronger and spiritually healthy and Alive than his knowledge of and adherence to the pure word of God that's profound only a prophet could bring that out of the mind of God to tell us that no True Believer is any stronger and spiritually healthy and Alive than his knowledge of and adherence to the pure word of God as seen by multitudes of examples in the Old Testament organization was growing a pace confirming and augmenting the death of the membership for Holy Ghost leadership was deposed and the Word was replaced by Creeds dogmas and man-made rituals I want you watch this when Israel entered into unlawful alliance with the world and formed Fellowship by marriage the day finally came when the world took over and Babylon carried away the people of God into captivity look now when they the Jews went into captivity they went in with a priesthood a temple and the word but when they came back they had rabbis a theological order of Pharisees a synagogue and a talmood and when Jesus came they were so corrupt he called them of their father the devil and this in spite of the fact they were of Abraham according to the flesh could we be message according just to the flesh I'm gonna preach it anyway that's right we're all Abraham's seed by by by birth but are we the Royal Seed of Abraham now watch in this age we see the same thing happening however as all Israel is not Israel and not all bride is bride but a little group were were the true spiritual Israelites so there would always be a little group of true Christians the bride of Christ until he came for his own doesn't matter how much Satan squeezes it you go there's going to be a bride in every age that fulfills every part of it and that's what you and I are in right now so this age started around 170 ad to 312 the messenger was irenius brother Bram said using our god-given rule of choosing the messenger for each age when unhesitantly declar that irenius was exalted by the Lord to that position he was a disciple that great Saint Warrior faith polycart and it's no doubt as he sat at the feet of that great man he learned the Christian Graces that FL flowed from his consecrated life for polycarp was one of the true illustrious Saints of look of all ages pretty nice guy when viewed in the light of a blameless life you will remember from your own reading that olart was martyred too old to flee too sincere a man to allow another to hide him and then suffer a penalty for doing so he gave himself up to death but before he did he asked for and was granted permission to pray two hours can we get five minutes but before he did he asked and was granted permission to pray two hours for his brethren in the Lord for the governor and for his enemies and his captors like the great great Saints of all ages and Desiring a better Resurrection he stood firm refusing to deny the Lord and died with a free conscience he was placed at the stake he was untied at his own request and the fire was lit the fire bent away from his body refusing to touch him he was then pierced through with a sword as this was done water gusted from his side and drowned the Flames what a saintly man what a testimony his Spirit was actually seen to depart in the form of a white dove released from his bosom yet for all this great testimony this student of John the Revelator was not militant against the nickan system for he himself leaned toward organization not realizing that the desire for fellowship and what appeared like a good plan to Foster the work of God was really a trick of the day a trick of the enemy with irenius this was not so he was militant against any form of organization all also his life history where he served the Lord was one of much manifestations of the Holy Spirit and the Word was taught with unusual Clarity we'll see that in just a second we'll get to it and then we'll close in Conformity to its original precepts his churches in France were known to have the gifts of the Spirit among them for the saint spok in tongues prophesied raised the dead healed the Sick by the prayer of faith he saw that danger of any kind of organized Brotherhood among the elders pastors Etc he stood solidly for a unified Spirit-filled gift manifesting local church and God honored him for the power of God manifested among the saints he was also clear in his understanding of the godhead see was since he was a disciple of the polycart who in turn was a disciple of John you can know he sure had a perfect teaching is possible on this subject so the messenger was irenius he was born in 130 ad and he died in 202 this is some of the things that some of the quotes that he said I want you to listen to this the glory of God is Man Fully Alive not God Fully Alive the glory of God is Man Fully Alive these are direct quotes from him Jesus the Incarnate Word is a meeting place between God and humanity and he wrote the book against heresies we'll look at that just a minute are are gnosticism he was a disciple of polycarp who was a disciple of John the Revelator and then it was recorded that he set the four gospels as the cannon of scripture he took out all the other ones the book of the mbes and all that that they were trying to force on the people he took these four and he said these are the gospels Matthew Mark Luke and John so they started using them as the gospel the central point of irenius is theology is the unity and goodness of God in opposition to the Gnostic theory of God which is a number of divine emanations and that's what gnosticism is you got many many gods along with a distinction between those two people boy that's a a read if you want to read it about the monad and the D merge irenius used the logos theology watch that he inherited from Justin Martyr the word martyr just didn't mean that just a martyr was martyred everybody with me I enus was a student of polycart who was said to have been tutored by John the Apostle now John had used logos terminology and the Gospel of John in the letter of First John irenius often spoke of the Son and the spirit as the hands of God though he also spoke of the son as the logos wow what a revelation irenius had and to the angel of the church in smna write these things sayith the first and the last which was dead and is alive and I wrote dead then alive Adam was alive then he died so it's not talking about him you were alive and then you died ain't talking about you who you talking about Jesus Christ whoever this is took death and turned it into life that's the guy we serve that's the guy that destroyed death as we say last Sunday in the resurrection let's stand he took death and turned it into life Sunday we're going to have a water baptism we're going to take death and turn it into life am you love the Lord I'll read some more of next Sunday about irenius but man he had a powerful powerful Ministry um in that second Church age and he didn't have like I said didn't have books and tapes if he was a student of Poli carp he had to hear what polycarp said put it in his filter and then speak it same way with polycart with John the Revelator cuz John the Revelator was pretty old when polycart was being polycart was he was teaching polycart so he had to remember all these things and we have a problem remembering scripture I can't hardly remember what scripture I read first part of the service but I do but I got wrote down right here but but you see what God did though and I don't say this to be frivolous but I mean we're just sometimes we're brain dead because we don't use our brain they had to listen they had to listen to every word they couldn't Veer off into space or or fall asleep if they did Paul prayed for them brought them back to life and started preaching again but they had to listen to what the spirit said they couldn't go back and say no no what was in Psalms what they didn't have a book of Psalms they have the Bible put together we got all this information yet sometimes we don't know a thing about God we got it right here that's why we have no excuse that's why in this age there when the Great Falling Away comes there's not anything to pick us back up because the great falling away is to come is coming from the last Church age messenger so if it's coming from that that's the last one then it goes to like brother R said it goes into complete apostasy which is Satan as we'll get to in a little while they will not sit in the synagogue of Satan they will be the very seat of the devil the Pope the Antichrist he will be the devil incarnate just like he incarnated the Beast back in the Garden of Eden he'll incarnate that man called a pope and you better not be here run to God flee to the ark don't worry about anything else don't worry about brother and sister worry about getting yourself there worry about getting yourself in but we all have a chance everybody will have a chance to come to God or you've already had it one of the other so let's sing a song God bless you then we'll be dismissed remember the water baptism this coming Sunday and and communion first service in foot washing I bless your name let's worship him just for a moment prisoners chain with bleeding St Paul [Music] and they weren't mad they had just got beat they had just got whipped and they weren sitting there saying bless God when I get out of here I'm going after them guys no they prayed for their captives then they started singing chain were L sing it to him and they were free I bless your name I bless your name I give you give you praise you know we're going to see down through these Church ages that very name got lost it got lost in the churches they started baptizing in titles making him a third person or a second person of a trinity but praise God we've been restored back by true Messenger so midnight if you should find you're in a PR we've all been there we've all been there in your mind reach out and praise oh sometimes it's heavy but all when you get them up it's not bad at all and they will fall whatever you need it'll fall Jesus name call on his name oh I bless your name we know what that name is we know that person is behind that name bless we know that person is inside of us telling us Just Call My Name just ask anything in my name and it'll be given to you you are the LI you're the truth the [Applause] way I bless your name sing a one more time I bless your name oh I bless your name we bless your name thank you Lord I bless your name I give you give you give you praise you're that tree of life you're that tree of life that we can take and live eternally I bless your name bless I bless your name amen you know the world calls that name Jesus Christ a lot that's right for a whole different meaning and that's blasphemy but if you'll call on his name and know who he is know his characteristic know how to approach God it's the sweetest name you'll ever hear it won't be a name that you say and curse him it it's a name that you'll say I love you Lord I love you and I know what your name is and I know where you are you're inside of me or you're trying to get inside of me or you're trying to get me to be baptized you're trying to get me to live a good [Music] life that's the name of Jesus Christ this message this message was the porter to get us in to where we can fully know who that man is the whole world does not know fully who Jesus Christ is they think he might be the second person they they call his name when they shouldn't they got him on a cross they got him in a tomb they got him out of a tomb but they got him in they can't get him inside of us cuz you're not perfect and I ain't perfect you know you've heard that before well he said I'm going to come back and live in you so I'm just going to believe that he's going to come back and live in us and through us and we're going to project God to this earth like no one else no one else I got a little something I'll bring to you Sunday that you and I just for a moment God's going to really shine in his bride right here at the end time there's going to be a moment in time that brother Brown says and I'll read a couple quotes where he says he said God another words will show her to show the bride to the world so hang on hang on if you're bride hang on if you're not bride get in if you're not bride get in get in then you'll be part of that that God's going to show one time he's going to show his bride and then what is's he going to do he's going to take her off of the earth and then all hell is going to break loose cuz there'll be no Grace on the earth it'll only be be for the Jews get in Christ
