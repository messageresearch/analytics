all I always en encourage my Sunday school class to be around the elders learn some wisdom and listen to the stories of how they came up in life and everybody thinks they have a hard life but let me tell you there's a lot to be learned when you're talking to the Elders of the church amen let's change over Service open the Eyes of My Heart Lord Open the Eyes of My Heart I want to see you I want to

there I'll get that I apologize everybody bear with us just a moment test test yes all right there we go God bless you all it's good to be here this afternoon this evening I know I struggle with remember what time of day it is when I preach but it's it's uh the night time um thank you I I'm just struggling tonight y'all bear with me all right we'll get there so tonight I'm going to read from um 2 Thessalonians chapter 2 and just take a little topic of he was bruised for my iniquities and uh as we go to prayer we certainly have a lot to pray for uh we've been watching all the things going on in Israel and uh boy as things come out it's really grieving to see all that they're going through over there so certainly keep them in prayer um somebody sent me a I saw something pop up where somebody they had killed a little a mother and father over there they had they were laying on top of their twin babies and um their twins they found them the day later and just all sorts of things like that that just really Grieve Your Heart to see and um I certainly as Believers we uh you know there's just like that special kinship that you know you see the Israelites that are one day there's going to be a selection of them going to they're going to receive the same message that we're heing today and certainly there's something within our heart that just reaches out to them and so let's remember them to keep them in our hearts and remember brother Wade as he's up in I guess he's in Illinois and remember us this weekend we'll be traveling to in out that little church outside Indianapolis to minister for them so keep us in your prayers um that we'll just have safe travels and and so forth let's go to the Lord in prayer Lord God we're so grateful to be able to gather around your word tonight Lord Jesus and there's many needs Lord that we're mindful of Lord Jesus even even in this congregation certainly many needs Lord Jesus on our mind constantly are the the ones that we've just mentioned over there in Israel Lord and all the needs here in our little church sister Freda and brother Dale and all the ones that are have needs in their body Lord and we just ask Lord that you'll Lord minister to all the needs tonight Lord Jesus you know the needs of your people Lord God and you Lord set us up that way so that we we'd constantly be needing you Lord Jesus but we've got promises laying there in the word Lord that You' never leave us or forsake us that you always you'd always be with us Lord God that you would always be our comfort and our guide Lord so we're looking to those promises tonight Lord Jesus Lord one one promise that we've got that we were looking at tonight Lord is that you promis that you would forgive us of all our iniquities that you were bruised for that purpose Lord Jesus and as we look into your word I pray God that you'll give us guidance and purpose in our life and understanding Lord Jesus to so that we have so that we are equipped to face the hour that we're living in and to go against the devil no matter what he brings to us Lord we just ask your blessing upon your word now in your name amen now 2 Thessalonians and um I'm I'm going to try to be kind of brief tonight we'll we'll see you know that's kind of dangerous when a minister says that I'm going to be brief and he goes long but we'll see 2 Thessalonians chapter 2 verse 1 to8 says now we beseech you Brethren by the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and by our gathering together unto him that ye be not soon shaken in mind or be troubled neither by Spirit or by word nor by letter as from us as that the day of Christ is at hand let no man deceive you by any means for that day shall not come except there come a falling away first and that man of sin be revealed the son of predition now think about those words that he's given unto him that that there's got to be some things happen first so don't be shaken if it takes a while for the things that we're talking talking to you about come to pass let no man deceive you by any means for that day shall not come except they're coming Falling Away first and certainly we're seeing a lot falling away today uh people all around the message all around the world giving up their faith and saying all the things that they've been preaching for 40 years are are not true just because they can't find evidence in the library of how how a bridge was built or something like that oh church we got to have a revelation Revelation is what we need and that man of sin be revealed the son of predition who opposeth and exalteth of himself above all that is God or that is worshiped so that he is God sth in the temple of God showing himself that he is God remember you not that when I was yet with you I told you these things and ye now you know what withholdeth that he might be revealed in his time for the mystery of iniquity doth already work only he who now leth will let until he be taken out of the way uh isn't that you may be seated the Lord at his Blessing to the reading of the word isn't that interesting the way that Paul speaks he' say things that like Peter said are hard to be understood that he would say something like that the mystery of iniquity do already work only he who now lth will let until he be taken out of the way what are you talking about Paul I I you know you're thinking about brother Brandon when he preached when he preached that that message the first seal he talked about how that in so many other places he talked about how that that um how that your journey through the gospel is like uh like a man shooting a Target and you know you start you start your journey off and you you you you know you're building one Doctrine on on the other building one Doctrine on the other and you're going somewhere and if you get one little thing off one little thing off that you need to go back and get that right otherwise you'll never get to the finish line now the and the quote that I'm reading from he said we were talking the other day about people who getting off the track it's just like shooting a Target if that gun is perfectly balanced perfectly trained and sighted it's got to hit the target unless that Barrel moves it's going to hit the target unless there's some external influence unless there's something the w a gust of wind the the barrel moves something happens or he said or twist or vibrations throws it off or wherever or a wind puff wherever it starts off at there's only one way to do is come back to where it left the track and start again if it's going to hit the target if it doesn't why it just doesn't hit the target now I I'm not y'all know I'm not a hunter I'm not somebody that goes and shoots bows and arrows but we can certainly look at those examples of somebody that's pulling that stre bow stream back and and and and just a little puffle wind will blow that era off and you might be just a little bit off back there when where the the person with the bow stands but by the time it gets to the Target it's way way off and see that's how we've got to approach the gospel we've got to be we've got to be so careful how we present and how we how we do because I I I think certainly that's really one evidence of the new birth is that promise laying there in the Bible that the spirit of truth will lead and guide you into all truth now you know going through life some some maybe don't have the capacity or the they get kind of off course and they they'll stop before they get to the goal and for those those kind of reasons but if we'll yield ourselves to to the Lord he will take us from the beginning to the end he'll take us to cross that finish line and and and see brother random said that's the way in studying scripture like an Archer standing there shooting at the Target or a a a person with a gun shooting at the Target that's the way in studying the scripture I believe you'll never figure it out with your mind it's got to come from God uh I I think maybe if we could just Define what a revelation is tonight you know you've got all these little bits and pieces laying here in the word and you can study out the statute of perfect man and study out adoption and study out Daniel 70 weeks and study out all the components but then the spirit of God will come and put everything together now there's what a revelation is now education you education you say look I'm I'm reading William Shakespeare and I see you read it and you read it and you're like oh that's a good point now that's education but Revelation is putting things together Revelation is where the picture begin to come together like a puzzle you go to the store and and you you'll get a puzzle with a it's on the box it's got a nice picture of what you're going to put together but you throw out all the pieces on the floor and you don't know where everything goes oh but there's if oh if you had like the author of that puzzle standing next to you and tell you oh that goes over on the right hand corner that goes over on the left then the thing begins to come together and you know where it goes that's why when you look when you read the Bible you've got to have a relationship with God you've got got it takes the spirit of God to put together the essence of this puzzle to paint the picture right and just like somebody shooting a Target you if you get off Off the Mark you you got to go back if you want to get to the Finish Line right you got to go back to where you got off off is't that interesting that he said somebody like shooting an air he described it as it it's on a track like a train like a train track and if it gets off the track you go back to where you got you you your your doctrine's off and get straightened out if we just make ourselves available to him that's why you know I I I began to meditate on you know it it's really it's you think about when we get up here and preach and and there's a lot that you don't really maybe see we come we come to Wednesday night service and Sunday morning and we we we speak for maybe an hour but you don't see a lot of the effort and the work that goes into that a lot of times it's not really spoken of so much but you know that's really a Minister's gift a gift uh that that that Minister has is to study to study and lay in the word and labor and labor and and study these things out so that you can share them with the people because many times you know people you that's not that's not your gift there are many gifts you read Romans 12 and 1 Corinthians 12 about gifts in the church there's Gifts of Mer mercy and Gifts of encouragement and all sorts of gifts that are in the body of Christ but there's a gift the The Minister's gift is to lay in the word and study because maybe maybe a poor little sister that's got a need in her body and she just you know just sitting there in a home she making some doing some crochet or something cooking some some some some nice biscuits or something in the morning to feed her family but she's not going to have that gift of study oh you think about how God put it together like that so that we would have to come together and see one another during the week and we would have to come together and you'd have to come together and God put it in the church gifts in the church so that there'd be some somebody that could study and lay before the Lord and get the will of God so that they could speak the word over the people and then there was be somebody that that would they would be predestinated to sit there in the Pew and listen to the word coming forth and say I believe that you see that's what you as a as a minister you you you talk about how we've we've got to we've got to keep the target we've got to keep things focused the right way and that's if that's what a Minister's gift then we are we have got to yield ourselves to study and prayer you know you go back into the into the book of Acts and find out that the reason why deacons were actually put into the church is because the ministers were they wanted to give themselves to study and prayer and that takes a lot of effort when you when you when you're studying I I think really if we were going to put some time to it it probably takes me about 20 30 hours of study to prepare for for one for one little 45 minute uh sermon and you you'll say I I've heard many people they'll poke and say well you when you get better at it you won't need to study that much and you know used to that used to affect me but listen really really we should study more and more because because that's that's our role and you see you study when you study when you get to the place where you think well I don't need to study anymore then something begins to something begins to slip in second Timothy Chapter 2 Paul told Timothy Paul's guiding his little his little his little student Timothy there he said of these things put them in remembrance charging them before the Lord that they strive not about words to no profit but to the but to the subverting of the hearers study to show thyself approved unto God a Workman that needeth not be ashamed rightly dividing the word of Truth you got to study to show that you're a Workman that's worthy that you're worthy of your calling study to get in the word and lay in the word so that when you stand behind the pullit you've got something to say that will help the people you know really a huge responsibility lays in the ministry if if there if the people that are sitting in the congregation don't have the same kind of gift that the minister does to really study and get in the word then it behooves us as ministers that we have to lay in the word because that is our responsibility you read in Ephesians 4:11 and 12 and it says that the ministry is actually given to bring the people the gift of the fivefold ministry to bring the people to the stature of a perfect man so it's up to us to lay in the word and do like they did in the early church give themselves totally to study and prayer study and study and study and prayer I remember when I first started preaching I I I got to to preach at another church and you know sometimes when you go out and preach at other churches the pastors there will they'll say things to kind of nudge you and help you and sometimes when you go up to preach they after you're done they'll say things to kind of correct you even while you're sitting there and those are things to help us and I remember I remember kind of complaining to the pastor I I was quoting Solomon much study is a wear to the flesh because in that instant I had felt like I had studied until I was just I could I I had studied until I couldn't hardly I was so weak I'd lost sleep I I I I'd studied and studied and and I thought I'd get some maybe some Grace from this minute from this pastor and he gave me no Grace he he pretty much told me well that's what you're supposed to be doing cuz that's you want to be able to preach something I I think that's our that's our example the example for a minister should be is you got to do everything you can to bring the gospel to the people cuz that's what you're that's what you're there for to lay in the word and pray unceasing and when we we begin to get lazy that oh you see what brother Ram said and God keeps his word he said what started any cult it was hungry children trying to find something to eat oh you think about there's people all around the world there's people in South America and all around the world that just want something to eat and the the field is ripe all they need is somebody to go preach the gospel if some somebody will catch the vision and go step out and preach and stop being lazy and do what God called him to do brother R said if you lazy bunch of preachers won't give them the gospel they'll eat out of a garbage can that's right I lay it on to you preachers that's right if you won't give the children the bread of life they'll take some kind of a scum out of a garbage can and eat it and oh oh certainly if you go out and preach anywhere you can see you can see the effect that I'm I'm not trying to be CR but lazy preachers laziness that won't study that won't study the word oh so how grateful should you be tonight if you're sitting in a church that's got preachers that will study and lay before God and study and study and study because Believers want the word Believers want to be fed and Eagles got to have Eagle food believer wants what is in this book this book that we've been talking about that was in the hand of God this book that we want we want revelation of what it means and if somebody can lay before God and study it out until they can preach it and preach it not so it not not like some some boring thing where we're white boring it but actually preach it until we know it's so good until we can run the A and preach it that's what God is calling us to do because we're searching why do we want that what's in that book because we're searching for a way back we're searching for a way back to what Adam lost and the way back is by the word and that's why something within any believer is craving for the word the other night when we were preaching on just a background just a little bit more Adam forfeited the book of life for the knowledge of Satan and lost his inheritance lost everything and no way for Redemption no way for Redemption that's what was in that book that's that's the importance of that book now the book we're talking about you take Christ is the word he is that book you take Christ the word and put him in letter form so that you could read about him and now you've got that book that Bible laying there in your hands and then if you take that same Christ and put him in your heart so that you can take the page the word and letter form off the page then it brings forth the essence of what's written and puts the puzzle together Adam had completely Supreme control of the earth he was a god of the earth God's the god of the universe everywhere but his son had this Earth under his own control he could speak he could name he could say he could stop nature he could do anything he wanted to see but when he did that he lost his inheritance oh you see why that's the book is so important to a Believer the word the word that's laying here in the pages of this book is so important to a Believer because oh you begin to eat this book and it slowly will take you back it's taking you back to what Adam lost it's restoring to you everything that Adam lost then God made in the likeness of man I'm just reading some things that brother Ram said came down and become a redeemer to us to redeem us and now we find out that in days passed by these things which was mysterious is to be opened up to us in the last days why is it going to be opened up in the last days because God's going to show you he's going to show you the whole Plan of Redemption to give you rapturing faith rapturing faith to know to see how your Redemption works to see what happened in your Plan of Redemption to see what how God is going to redeem the Earth to see the same way that he redeems you and redeems the Earth he redeemed the 144,000 and you see all the puzzles being put together brother said a tree never died before Adam an animal life an animal Wouldn't Die before Adam and there's only one thing that cannot die and that's God because he's Eternal and that's the only way we can ever keep from dying we have to have eternal life in us to be Sons and Daughters of God but when we died to sin we sold out our Birthright and crossed this Chasm now we're beyond the reach on this other side of the chasm and in Revelation 5:2 it says a I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice who is worthy to open the book and to loose the seals thereof now as we were preaching last time how who is worthy there is nobody but how how's that book going to be open not by our own own works not by our own devices not by you you're not going to be able to make that era Hit The Target just by willing it to but it's going to take God to do it God to put the puzzle together he said as soon as John heard this announcement for the kinsman redeemer to come forth and to make his claims there was no man that could do it no man in heaven no man in earth no man beneath the Earth and no one was worthy even to look at the book just think of that no person at all worthy even look at it and John just started weeping now I I I like to repeat things because I think it helps us but look why why was he weeping you you got the whole book of redemption laying there what what if that book couldn't be open that all these people that that were all the ones that were born again on the day of Pentecost are now in the grave they're never coming up if that book couldn't be open that the the dead Saints are never going to rise from the grave the pollution of this Earth is just going to go on on and on the the the mess of oh you think about over there in in in Israel what's going on the Israelites attack attack the Palestinians they attack Hamas then Hamas gets upset because they kill their children they attack them back and they go back and forth and back and forth and it'll never get resolved if that book hadn't open you just go back and forth with that's that's what all that's the the best that Satan has to offer is a lot of people getting upset with one another oh that's why God has called us to love and not not to return not to return hateful words and hateful things with with more hateful actions because that doesn't solve anything God wants us to love some one another when somebody does something wrong to you R return love for it and that'll stop the devil in his tracks love is the answer and John was weeping there because who is going to open the book he he wasn't worthy in in his own self he wasn't worthy nobody's worthy to open up that book and quickly we find his weeping stopped and one of the elders said don't weep John for the lon of the TR Tri of Judah has prevailed in other words overcome and is concered conquered and John turning he saw a lamb coming out and everything in heaven began to cry worthy oh I think you oh certainly that that'll make somebody rejoice when they see what God has done what God has done in your life to look back and remember all the things all the challenges that God has brought you through all the things that's happened aren't you glad this afternoon couldn't we all say that aren't you glad that the price has been paid that we've got somebody to take all our iniquity and cover it over wash it away and the bleach of his blood and take care of it aren't you glad that you've got a lamb and we've got a lamb tonight we've got a lamb that can open up this book and reveal it to us and make the things plain I I I I thank God that we've got a revel we should have a revelation of the things as as the book begins to be open you think you think about that it was a lamb the lamb a lamb is the is the the animal that God wanted to represent himself as brother R preached that sermon the lamb and the dove talking about Jesus going out into the water as John the Baptist was standing there to baptize him and a Dove came it looked like a dove the spirit com and and and landed on went into him and they're symbolizing Christ was symbolized in two of the meekest most mildest humblest creatures a lamb that that a lamb you lead a lamb to the slaughter and it's not going to fight back it's not going to say anything it'll just bite its tongue as Monica growing up she she heard uh her she'd wake up many times and see her her parents had killed a lamb the night before and the little lamb be laying there on the table as they clinged it and it its tongue would be hanging out cuz it would it would bite its tongue as it was killed the the meekest gentest creature and that's what Christ is the meekest humblest gentest creature so Meek that it could be led as Christ was led up to be crucified on that cross then oh you think that's what God wants he's trying to mold us into that same kind of gentle Meek nature where we don't rile back we're not constantly biting and devouring one another but that same gentle nature why because God wants us to wants to fill us with his Spirit and the spirit of the Lord is timid it's timid oh you see that's why God before before you first get the Holy Ghost God's got to clean your soul up he's got to get that old nasty Spirit out that unclean Spirit clean the place up because the Holy Ghost is timid and the Holy Ghost is not going to come rest on any unclean thing anything that's any anybody that's that oh what what are you talking about brother Rob I'm talking about why the necessity for the virtues that are on this board behind me to for that super anointing to come in the life of a Believer you got to have brotherly kindness you got to have patience oh if if you God cleaned you up before he filled your soul then what about when he feels you feels when he's going to feel every fiber of you beating he's got to clean you up to a place where you're just Meek and gentle able to be led by the spirit when the spirit speaks to you and says go over there and go over here talk to this brother or whatever you're just you're just so in tune with the spirit that you listen to what the spirit says Meek and humble that's what God wants a Believer to be and that's what John saw he saw a lamb coming forth from the throne and the lamb was worthy and the lamb was worthy we're not worthy but the lamb was worthy and the lamb will will make you worthy so that you can read the book not by by your own power but by the power of the Holy Ghost God that's in you that has made you worthy because he's cleaned up your life and Sanctified you and covered you in his blood brother said the dove is the gentest thing of Heaven and the lamb is the gentlest beast on Earth they had to be the same if the dove would have flew on a wolf the wolf would have snorted and the dove would have taken his flight and that's the way today that we find ourselves with all our tempers and our fussing oh all our tempers and fussing the holy spirit is gentle it will only dwell in a gentle Place lamb led by a dove oh you think about when we come into the house of the Lord that's why we don't have uh we don't say our greetings and everything in the sanctuary we don't let their kids run up and down the aisle because the Holy Ghost is timid oh you want the holy ghost in your house just greet each other with love and stop all the yelling and screaming and have turn off the that TV and turn on it turn on a little message and turn on some good old gospel music and set the atmosphere where the Holy Ghost will feel welcome oh I want the Holy Ghost to feel welcome I want him to be welcome in my life I want him to be welcome in my home I want him to welcome in the things that I do even at work I want to I I I don't want to do anything that would displease the Holy Ghost because he's very timid and a testimon on on the sea brother R said the holy spirit is very timid very timid it just won't talk tolerate nothing wrong they identifi Christ of all ages he said the holy spirit is timid very very timid and where you just have one unbeliever or a skeptic sitting around the Holy Spirit just can't work hardly that's why he had to tell everybody in jus' house get out everybody leave because the Holy Ghost has got to go to work and he can't do it in an atmosphere of unbelief somebody somebody at odds with what he's trying to do that's why God has got he's changing your character to make you Gentle and meek and loving so that the capf stone can rest upon your life what is it a Capstone of love where you can love somebody love somebody that hates you love somebody that back bites you love somebody that gossips about you that you can love that's what the Capstone is is love you say well love is to do the will of the father well I thought the will of the father was to love my neighbor as myself I thought the will of the father was to love the Lord thy God with all thy heart and all thy soul and then to love your neighbor as yourself and so you see it's all wrapped up in love it's love to love one another and to love God that's why the virtues of the stature of a perfect man are require that God is molding you into his character to be like him and act like him and walk like him and talk like him and react like him and behave like him oh Godly compassion is to do the will of God this this is a quote from brother Brandon Godly compassion is to do the will of God compassion in the Realms of spirit means to do the will of him that sent you oh think about how Paul was bound bound by chain and by feathers of love to do the will of God and that only so you think about think about what that Capstone is so you are so wrapped up in God until you only do the will of the father I do nothing except the father shows me I don't do anything except the father show me when the father reveals himself to you and Reveals His word do you you act upon that and nothing else if it's not in his word why because the Antichrist has been booted out you're you're it's word and word only you're not listen it's not one word off human love brother BR said would make you shoot a man on account of your wife but the love that comes from above would make you pray for his lost soul and that's the kind of love that God is going to have manifest in his bride but it takes God to produce Divine love you know the seals what what do they reveal they reveal what God has done down through the seven in church ages they reveal how God is going to redeem the Earth and they reveal what God has done in your life from your birth to be molded to be Christlike on up to where God finishes it by revealing the seven Thunders to give you rapturing Faith but there's nothing to reveal if Christ hasn't changed you that's why you go back and listen to how brother Dale used to preach it he' say do you do you have a lamb do you have a lamb to reveal it and and he he would lay it down hard what's he what's what's the point he's trying to make it behooves us to make sure I I like he'd say I I he used to say I'd rather go my whole life seeking to make sure that I really am born again then to find out the End come down come down to the wire and and and to find out maybe on your deathbed or something that you really never surrendered to God and I I I tell you there's many ways that you can examine yourself and see are you are you born again are you being changed is the word being open to you as you read the Bible is it being revealed to you or are you still are you still the same way that you were 20 or 30 years ago are you more in love today with the word as you were 20 or 30 years ago or has it become just some kind of a a boring thing where you're just kind of sitting there and going through the motions oh if you're not in love today with with a God more than you were 20 to 30 years ago I I urge you to just fall love fall back in love with him oh you that's why brother Brown when he was preaching the first seal he he'd start talking about the foolish virgin that laying here in my notes the foolish virgin who were so foolish and and went and started on their Journey without oil a and they got to the end and they realized that they heard the bridegroom call and they began to realize I I should have carried oil with me I should have had some oil with me to keep my fire burning I I can't even trim my lamp now because I don't have o any oil to put in the lamp and the whole creation lays in his hand now on which the whole Plan of Redemption is sealed by seven mysterious seals in this book that he took and he alone can reveal it to whomsoever he will so we're depending on the lamb to give us understanding aren't we what does he do if he's a king he has to have subjects and his subjects is them that he has redeemed and they cannot come before him until he takes the rights of redemption and now he walks forth from a mediator where death put us in the grave he comes forth with the r brother man would say this book actually oh you think about this book lay in there what what book is it it's a book of Christ and that's why that's why you know you help preachers say that the book was you but look look how the pattern is the book is Christ and when Christ is revealed it's it's a byproduct or a side effect of that that it also reveals you oh you think about the three what is the three-fold mystery under the seventh seal first the seven Thunders reveal Christ and the second fold is that the bride is revealed see as Christ is revealed it reveals the bride and that's how you when you when you begin to see Christ in his word unfold it reveals you also and this book Au I I I know y'all getting tired y'all like you preaching on iniquity on the in the on a Wednesday night see yall I'm not going to keep you long tonight I I I know how it is I I'm I know I I'm empathizing this this book actually was planned and written before the foundation of the world and this book so this book has you as part of it it's your name is in the book how is your name in the book that when you read it and God begins to reveal it to you you can identify yourself with the stories and the events and the things that are happening in this book and you begin to identify yourself with the things that are taking place and when the seals begin to open open up to you you can be you can begin to identify yourself with those things that are revealed from the back to the front of the Bible all through it and it opens up to you really that you you are part of this book that God thought of from before the foundation of the world you're part of it that just as he thought just as he spoke of Christ oh you think about this that everything that he said about Jesus Christ was also prophesied of you all the events of Jesus's life that he went to the water to be baptized that he went to mount Transfiguration to be adopted that he died to himself in the Garden of Gethsemane that he died and yielded up everything on the cross all those things lay a pattern for you that you look at that and identified with it just as you identified with the stories that are laid out in the Old Testament that speak of those things that we can read about when we look at Jesus Christ in Jesus Christ your name your your name your being who you are is all wrapped up in who Jesus Christ is this book actually was planned and written before the foundation of the world this book was really he said this book was really written before the foundation of the world I had that in my notes twice so y'all forgive me he said the lamb in the time of intercessory back here he knew that there were names in there that was put in there from the foundation of the world and as long as them names have never been manifested on Earth as yet he had to stay there as intercessor so what's God doing on the throne he's an intercessor is somebody who acts on behalf who intervenes on behalf of another so as these names are coming forth as these people are coming forth and hearing the word for their day he's intervening to make sure to to bring that body together until the last one is called and then we can all be called home then he can step forth and and open that book and reveal his contents and reveal reveal what happened oh brother Ram say that's perfectly predestination where was thou when I laid the foundation of the earth God asked job where were you you were your name was in a book and you weren't somebody like somewhere like a person but you are in God's thinking and God's thoughts are Eternal so God from eternity always knew that you were coming and he you had to come and when he when you come with in every age somebody all these different all these different people down Through the Ages were coming and God's on the throne interceding taking care of them therefore as long as there wasn't one name had never yet been declared as long as there was one name hadn't never yet been declared in Earth Christ had to stay there as an intercessor to take care of that name each name being washed in the Clorox bleach of his blood every name being washed until they're all redeemed and he said and then the book is a revelation so a revelation is something that's made known of something that's been revealed it's closed up until the latter time see the whole mystery of it is closed up until the latter time as the seals are broken and released the mysteries of the book are revealed the whole mystery of it closed up who's in that book how are they redeemed what is the process all those things are closed up but then it's revealed and when it's revealed oh you can see your name in the book then when it's revealed personally to you if you got a lamb if you've got the baptism of the Holy Ghost there to open up that that book up to you then you can see your name he said it's a scroll and then when the scroll is Unwound that's one then laying right in the scroll is number two and right here it says what it is but it's a mystery oh you think about now we've heard it explained over and over again that the the book that we're talking about is not a book like what we read but it's a scroll and it's got you you open up you you you take that first seal off and then you read what's under that first seal and you got to read it in order it's got to be broken in order you can't start on the seventh seal and then go back to the first seal it's got to start in order the first seal opens and then the second seal opens all the way down to the seventh seal and under the seventh seal are seven Thunders and the Seven Thunders is the end of the conclusion of the matter that's something very important to keep in mind what is this book of redemption this title deed Abstract title deed he you say abstract what does an abstract mean means that search all the way back to its beginning like that little drop of ink this morning when it struck that bleach it went all the way back and when sin has been confessed and fallen into the blood of Jesus Christ it gives an abstract right straight back to the Creator again and you become a Son of God the abstract title deed is held into the hand in the hand of that Almighty of the almighty and that's what the the complete revelation of this book is it shows that there's no squatter it shows you the devil got to get off your property cuz you can trace it all the way back oh oh you you think about what God is doing as you grow in Grace and knowledge and the devil's been telling you all this stuff all the time you ain't worth nothing I you ain't even called to preach the gospel whatever he tells people he's going to tell something different the different ones but you grow to the place where you realize no what what is the co what is the antidote to all the stuff that devil can throw to you it's re throw at you it's Revelation Revelation the word a revelation of the word when when the devil came to tempt Jesus and he and he and he kept at turn these stones into bread what what did Jesus do back at him the word the word and that's how you'll defeat the Devil every time when he begins to tell you I don't think you're really a Christian you give him the word back because if you got a revelation I am a Christian I I because I can identify myself in the word then then what's the devil won't have a leg to stand on oh you see what's revealed in these seals that the devil is a bluff oh when you when you come to the place where you realize the devil the devil this this abstract title deed searches it all the way back and the devil has got to go because he's not an owner he's just a squatter he's got to go an abstract title deed searches all the way back to see who if there's any lean problems on the land if any ownership problems any and and it'll you know what another thing an abstract title to eat is it'll give you a detailed description of the property now that's why that's why we've got the seals have got to be open to us so we know what we got access to because it'll give you a detailed description of everything that you've got access to you've got access to full Redemption it's Redemption the Redemption of the of the mean it's Redemption means all legal possession to all that was lost by Adam and Eve that you possess everything that that Adam and Eve lost now Adam and Eve we know Adam and Eve had were in speaking conditions they could if they didn't like the weather they could they could make the breeze blow a little bit better they had that spoken word air conditioning system if they was if it was too hot they could just speak and the wind would blow a little bit oh but think about all the other things that you got access to if you've got a true revelation of this these of this book that you got access to healing in your body because what is the rapture it's that fin that final sweep of healing over your body you've got access to a sound mind when the Devil comes to you with all of his lies well I don't think you this I don't think you that you just tell him what the word says and tell him well listen I got a benefit package y'all know y'all know how I preach I I got a benefit package that I could claim access to it'll give you it searches all the way back to you you you've got deliverance from complexes Oh Glory to God I think we should all praise from that surely we've all got complex lexes that we've been delivered from of and maybe maybe even right now we've got complexes that we're dealing with what we think we're what what is a complex it's a devil pestering you and hammering you and telling you like a minister nobody cares about your preaching and that'll be a complex and what it is it's the devil the devil telling you that or maybe a young person sitting there and and and and the devil will tell you nobody cares about you nobody in the church cares you're just on your own and it ain't nothing but the devil oh but God when God really comes on the scene and gives you a revelation that he does care then that changes everything you know sometimes you you look and see some how how people respond to preaching and I think one of the one of the most how to word this you see some of the most drastic responses when you're preaching about how much God cares you almost see because people it's the devil has beat on people to so much until they they don't think nobody cares and they just get down in a valley of depression oh but that's what God wants you to know that he does care and when it's preached it begins to create like a confidence in the people something begins to happen cuz they they need to hear that oh oh but don't let just the minister tell you that he cares let God speak to you let that voice of God Thunder out in your heart so that you know that he cares and it's not somebody that a preacher told you in a prayer line that you're born again or a preacher told you sometime some where that that God cares about you but when God cares when God tells you himself that will change everything oh that's why it's so important for you to be born again it's so important you got to be born again because being born again is when God is speaking to you personally and when you read the letters on the page it's not because somebody educated you into it or told you a bunch of theology but God is actually revealing his word to you and quickening it to you and making it living reality in you and giving you something to fight the devil with oh you think about all these things that we've got access to a righteous life oh think that we we can live by the power of the Holy Ghost a righteous holy life devoid of a complex where you feel like you got to lash out at somebody in anger because they don't like you or you feel like you got to get back at some oh thank God that he give us the power to live a life where we can love one another and forgive one another oh and if you can't do that tonight oh that's what God wants you to do is give it over to God if somebody's wronged you or treated you wrong just put it all on him and say I I want God I want you to take away this old bitter cold heart of mine and change me so that I can love somebody else oh that's the holy ghost power that the opening of the seals is meant to give the church Church a righteous life and healing and sound mind and back to spoken word conditions where if you don't like that mountain you can speak to it and it'll move out of the way listen there's a prom it might seem outlandish but there's a promise lay in the Bible that somebody's faith is going to grow from a little small dot of Mustard Seed Faith until it is mountains side fa size faith and that mountain siiz faith is going to tell the mountain get out of the way it's going to tell the Son and the moon like Joshua to stop or whatever the need is because you believe what God has spoken and that is what is laying in the seals now Adam could not meet the requirements of redemption I I'm I'm not even going to hard I thought I thought I didn't have enough notes tonight y'all Adam could not meet the requirements of redemption after he lost it he needed Redemption himself so he cannot do it and you and I can't do it either by our works oh we need God to come on the scene we need a lamb to open up the book now we got a lamb if you got the new birth we got a lamb the lamb is the only one that can reveal it now this is one of my favorite quotes in the message I've been I've been sitting on this quote for years saying I'm one day I'm GNA I'm GNA preach this and here it is this is one of the most profound think about this now we've been you think when is the Lamb going to come forth all these kind of things and brother R made this statement as he was preaching the first seal he said and now the lamb is standing now tonight he's got the book in his hand and starting to reveal it amen now the lamb is standing now tonight he's got the book in his hand and starting to reveal it oh you think about it's not something to look way off in the future put something way way off somewhere but he's stand now back then brother Brown preaching that sermon years how many decades ago I don't know I can't do the math now many decades ago standing there preaching a a and the lamb there was standing there o ready to open the book but for years it's been closed to so many it's been closed to me I didn't know what it was but then one day the lamb will come forth and reveal it now wherever you are wherever you are in your journey it's possible to understand what is written in this book maybe maybe you're sitting there and your mind is closed and you're wondering I will I ever understand all these things all these things that are that that seem so what are the four beasts what what is Iniquity what really what what is the thunder what's the seven Thunders all these bits and pieces to go together oh but oh let me just encourage you get that get that fervor like the berans did when they get to went to flipping through the Bible to see if the things that they had heard about were really true because God will reveal it to somebody that really wants it that's right if you want it he will reveal it to you when the seals completely are broken brother R said the time of redemption is over Redemption is over it's complete the process of redemption is over he comes forth he stands he stands stand up takes the book to show that there's nothing else that has to be done in that process of redemption the time of redemption is over because the lamb left the intercession post to walk out to take his claims when the real Revelation happens on the seals as they begin to break the lamb is coming forth from the sanctuary now doesn't that paint just a beautiful picture that the sanctuary all Smoky and the Lamb's coming forth he's coming forth and as he's coming coming forth to make his presence revealed to make himself known things begin to be understood and brother Ram will say here is the plan of it y'all doing all right here is the plan of it I I really I'm not I'm just few more minutes five five or 10 minutes and then we'll close the first thing happens there is an announcement in the heavens first what happened a seal is open what is that a mystery is unfolded the Angel of the church catches the mystery of God not fully yet revealed but when he does he catches this mystery of God and then he goes forth to the people just like here come forth in the early ches church ages will get it after a while a do look he's laying forth this pattern he's laying this pattern out that that down through the church ages a little bit would be known known known and then there at the end the seventh Church age messenger would come now look at this pattern he's laying out the seventh Church age messenger would come and tie up all the Loose Ends and finish it so the seventh Church age messenger is the end right it finishes all the all the ties up all the Loose Ends and all the Mysteries are revealed when that seventh Church age messenger preaches when it preaches his message well in the same way the seals are unfolded in the same manner where the seals open and they open and they open and they open but the seventh seal under the seventh seal seven thund sound and the seventh seal is the end of all thing and we know the we've heard it preached before the seventh seal is Christ but the seventh seal under those seven Mysteries it's all wrapped up it's all tied up that's why there's silence in heaven for for half hour because he said it was like every the sitting there between wondering you know wondering something's got to happen something's got to unfold because the seventh Seal's got to finish it brings the conclusion of the whole thing it end it shows the end the end of the devil's work the end the end of the whole matter and at the end brother R said at the end of the Pentecostal age I'm talking about patterns now I think it's so helpful to be able to see these patterns in scripture so that we understand what's happening just like Moses went up on top of the mountain he saw the pattern that God had laid out for him to go back down and build because when we see the pattern laid out it helps us to understand you know sometimes you know if you if you stretch it way out across many many many sermons then you'll forget at the end what was talked about at the end but if we can see the whole pattern to begin with then we kind of have a frame of reference where we see where we're going and brother I would say at the end of the Pentecostal age we are supposed to receive according to the word as God helped me tonight to show you that through here that we are to receive a messenger that will take all those loose ends out there and reveal the whole Secret Of God for the rapturing of the church all down through the seven Church ages messenger revealed just little bits and pieces Martin Luther saw justification and and Luther saw sanctification and on and on but here at the end the end it's all wrapped up together and seven Thunders will be revealed in the last days in order to get the bride together for rapturing Faith because what we got right now we wouldn't be able to do it we've got to step farther we got we got to oh see last time we were talking about the importance of the Seven Seals and I I want to ress that as we're about to close here that we must understand the Seven Seals because the Seven Seals gives us the understanding and the Revelation from God that those it's going to draw those dead Saints out of the Grave so be diligent be sure make sure you really are a genuine believer and not as brother Ram preached in the first seal a foolish version not just somebody that thinks they are are are real and true but isn't carrying allil to put in their lamb all right here we get second that's ionians 2:7 for the mystery of iniquity do already work only he who now lth will let until he be taken out of the way who he that lth see a mystery the mystery of iniquity way back in that very first church age here here's Paul writing saying that the mystery of iniquity what mystery of iniquity deceivers deceivers somebody deceiving you off the people off into something what is it it's a spirit working to deceive now you think about as we're as we're about ready to close I'm I'm not making vain promises we we'll close in just a moment it's a spirit we are influenced by spirits and this mystery of iniquity is a spirit that influence people in that first church age it influences still today because it's it's moving on it's what is it it's that it's the devil we're influenced by spirits and Satan was that first influencer you go back all the way back to the very beginning that the the war waged in heaven between Michael and and the angels and the angels that that left and and then those angels were cast down to heaven and now those angels the fallen angels and the real true loyal angels to God are influencing people to go one way or the other now Ezekiel chapter 28 it says Thou Art the anointed cherub that cth and I have set I have set thee so thou was upon the holy mountain of God speaking of Satan thou has walked up and down in the midst of the stones of fire thou was perfect in thy ways from the days that thou was created till iniquity was found in thee what what is Iniquity iniquity is something that you know you ought not to do and you do it anyhow now see there's the thing where we start if we really examine ourselves if you really examine yourselves you you start finding there there's iniquity like and and you start wondering if you really exam look in the mirror when you get home why do I do stuff that I know I shouldn't do why you know you preach and you preach and you preach you that you need to come to church you need to read your Bible or here's here's something to think about that you need to be born again and yet people won't do it you you can preach and preach and preach and you know you know what the Bible says that you need to come and be baptized the right way and yet people all around the world that like think about all those ministers that brother Ram would preach at them and they said we are going to be baptized the right way and they didn't do it I I was actually reading this sermon the other day where he was talking about that and he said they promised that they were going to come and be baptized the right way and and then they never showed up and you think about that now think about that tonight as we're meditating on these things why is that that somebody would know what to do but won't do it and we're all guilty it all cuz it's a iniquity is a a symptom of the Fall In the Garden and we're all products of iniquity we've all been born shaping an iniquity and so you can you look at yourself and you say why am I the way I am because because there's iniquity why would anybody do something that they know they shouldn't do how do I get rid of that why would somebody do something they don't they know they shouldn't do why would eve eat from the tree when God told her not to well we know what happened the devil see that's what that's what that mystery of iniquity is it's a deceiver preaching something just like the devil come along and was preaching something to Eve there's that mystery of iniquity what's what's a mystery it's a mystery because you're like there's something something moving here and it's not revealed yet but that's what Paul is saying in 2 Thessalonians sooner or later you keep following along and after a while it's got a crown on his head after a while it's sitting sitting there in the temple of God and oh there it is oh I see but but there's something behind there all that time that it was a m it was a mysterious thing that Paul could only speak about in vague terms of mystery of iniquity but it's that thing that that that it's the devil moving and and it might not be quite manifest in the early stages but you given enough time and you for before long it's going to it's going to come out like like it came out with Judas hiding in Judas until all of a sudden boom what is Iniquity iniquity in Hebrew is that word Avon that means to bend or twist or distort it's like a crooked old man that that's walking his backs are crooked and he's walking with a cane and and and it's all twisted up so you take God's word and you twist it and there you've got iniquity so it's bent and it's not the right thing it's not living right it's something that is distorted so iniquities are bending twisting or distorting of the law of God's word to different degrees in Isaiah chapter 53 he said all we like sheep have gone astray we have turned everyone to his own way every one of us everybody is guilty and the Lord oh think about this the next part of this and the lord has laid on him the iniquity of us all now if you can think that's really the conclusion of my sermon tonight you think you think what is this got to do with the first seal meditate on these things that God has taken all of our iniquity all of our iniquity and it's all laid on him that he's got the problem for our iniquity solved if we'll just trust in him amen amen in Psalm chapter 66 it says if I regard iniquity in my heart the Lord will not hear me when you know that you should stay with the word of God as brother R said you know that you should stay with the word of God but for the church's sake or somebody else's sake or something else you'll stray from the word of God and do what the organization says oh to think about think about what a crooked twisted distorted thing that is to see the word of God laid out plainly and say no I'm not going to do it oh we that's why we've got to be born again you got to be born again I'm I'm trying to find a closing Place y'all let me skip through my I'm skipping all these quotes about iniquity I'm skipping all these things down we'll close on this brother Bram said Remember When the foolish virgin went to buy oil he said oh you say now wait a minute brother Bram I don't know about that when they went to buy oil when they come back the bride was done gone and the door was shut and they knocked and said let us in let us in but they were in outer darkness and you know that you must be born again you must be born again in Psalm 51 it says behold I was shap and in iniquity and in sin my mother did conceive me you think about what iniquity is to know that you need to do something as musicians come forward and we'll close on this to know that you you got to do something and you won't do it and you know you know tonight that you must be born again it's iniquity if you won't be born again if you won't give your heart to God and do oh God don't require Works he don't require you to do like a Catholic and push a penny up a a bunch of steps or something to do a bunch of novenas he doesn't even require you to come to the minister and confess all your sins what God requires is for you to submit to him and be born again be born again and let him take your iniquity away be born again and let him take the sin problem away in Psalm 51 behold thou desirest truth in the inward parts and in the hidden part Thou shalt make me to know wisdom Purge me with hsip and I shall be clean wash me and I shall be whiter than snow oh if we'll just let God wash us he'll make us wider than snow he'll take all all of that sin problem all that sin curse and wash it away in the Clorox bleach of his blood and how do you get to the blood you get to the blood by the word let's stand to our feet and worship him you love the Lord tonight time is filled with swift transition not of Earth on move can stand build your hopes on things Eternal oh to God's unchanging [Music] hand oh to God God's unchanging hand hold to

like that story brother random told where he reached up to that guide wire and held it held on to it he said Lord I'm not letting go of this till I get to my destination we've got a guide the spirit of truth will lead and guide us to all truth if we just will hang on to that and not let go let's just go to the Lord in prayer and we'll be dismissed Lord Jesus we're just so thankful for your word and thankful for your many blessings to us Lord Jesus I pray God that you'll just bless all the ones that AR aren't able to be with us here tonight the ones that are on the road Lord Brother way in
