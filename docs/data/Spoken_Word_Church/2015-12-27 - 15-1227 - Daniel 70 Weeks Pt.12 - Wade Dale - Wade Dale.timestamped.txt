[0:00] and your new year will be wonderful I
[0:08] told you last Sunday we were going to
[0:12] look over the 6 volt purpose because in
[0:16] dec six whole purpose if all of Daniel
[0:19] seventy weeks just like the book of
[0:21] redemption for us after pride like that
[0:26] hit the book of Revelation which to the
[0:28] variety shows from the redemption of all
[0:32] 17 changes I showed rapture chose to I
[0:36] mean a resurrection the rafters jobs us
[0:40] going to them going to millennium shows
[0:43] God and preventing this out to the Jews
[0:45] shows all that in that in that book of
[0:48] Revelation looks to me a book of Daniel
[0:51] is the same as the book of Revelation
[0:52] but the book of daniel is a book of
[0:54] revelation to the Jew all right but the
[0:57] revelations is to us to church and to
[1:02] the huge right goes remember the
[1:04] property God said brother branham
[1:06] brother around saying that the Bible
[1:08] says and he said that the bride goes up
[1:11] in Revelation for one and doesn't come
[1:13] back to Revelation 19 so anything in
[1:14] between there it's got to do with the
[1:16] Jews that's the part we're talking 770
[1:20] weeks down but the 70 weeks a day you'll
[1:23] remember begins there 445 BC a time
[1:27] limit they bring out them did you have a
[1:31] time limit download book right to the
[1:33] day 1260 days they're getting preached
[1:35] to 1260 days all right so now let's turn
[1:38] the Daniel 9 24 and read this and I hope

[2:24] Pentecost which was 50 days after the
[2:27] resurrection okay all right when the day
[2:32] of Pentecost was fully come God came
[2:34] back as a promise and a form of the Holy
[2:37] Ghost into the people on the day of
[2:39] Pentecost it was the Jewish day of
[2:41] Pentecost so these things all happen on
[2:44] feast days they know you know Jesus was
[2:46] was in the temple in talking about being
[2:49] on a feast day Jesus being a temple on
[2:51] feast day why he was word he was though
[2:55] speed remember he said there were my

[2:58] their gods people that one's got
[2:59] standing in their television and now
[3:02] those feast days had come from paper to
[3:04] a human flesh right so let's read our
[3:09] Daniel 70 weeks scripture Daniel 9 24
[3:15] because what we're going to do is we're
[3:17] going to continue on man we go on and it
[3:23] will refer back to this when we get to
[3:26] that 70th week alright so okay tight

[3:40] alright so here we know what we're doing
[3:44] is we're showing where the 70 weeks
[3:46] begins we're going to show the time
[3:48] periods and then by God's grace will see
[3:51] when it ends ok we have someone you
[3:55] today
[3:57] he's your brother and you said that
[3:59] under your breath like using them ? yeah
[4:04] they'd smile now I know you like I know

[4:10] you with us what's your name cuidate
[4:12] anyway it's just remember growing little
[4:19] tea yeah Wow okey-dokey then so maybe
[4:25] George are saying I read or talk don't
[4:27] want to come out you know but good to
[4:31] have you with us today so Daniel nine
[4:34] seventy weeks are determined upon by
[4:36] people who Jews and upon the holy city
[4:41] Jerusalem to do six things to finish the
[4:46] transgression to make an end of sins to
[4:50] make reconciliation for iniquity to
[4:52] bring in everlasting righteousness and
[4:54] steal at the vision and prophecy and to
[4:55] anoint the most holy their six things
[4:58] we're going to continue know therefore
[5:00] and understand their from the going
[5:03] forth of the commandment to restore and
[5:05] rebuild and to build Jerusalem until
[5:07] Masada French there'll be seven weeks
[5:09] and threescore and two weeks seven weeks
[5:12] starting to get the temple down here
[5:14] seven weeks and watch three score three
[5:17] times two is six sixty two weeks so you
[5:21] got a seven-week period and a sixty two
[5:24] week period that the walls are going to
[5:27] be building in even in trouble this time
[5:30] all right and then after the three score
[5:32] after 62 weeks Messiah be cut off so
[5:35] we've come from 445 bc when they build
[5:39] the streets in the walls right got
[5:42] streets in the walls built come over
[5:44] come over come over there's no profits
[5:45] from Malachi's and Jesus is several
[5:47] hundred years in there right right so
[5:51] you come over here and you got Jesus
[5:52] coming on the scene at 4 BC and Dives
[5:56] 8030 mixing 33 years old and that's our
[6:00] mark according to the prophets message
[6:02] then according to the Bible I see the
[6:04] test
[6:06] that's what it is now what is 7-time
[6:10] remember one week equal flights seven
[6:12] years seven times seven is 149 all right
[6:16] now then you take 60 2 times 7 is 434 49
[6:21] plus 434 is 483 years all right so
[6:26] that's your first two periods seven-week
[6:28] period in a sixty two week period makes
[6:31] 483 years when I last nine the full part
[6:36] or even it doesn't finish dangle 70
[6:39] weeks right because what seven times
[6:42] seven is 490 so four hundred ninety
[6:45] minus 483 is what davin one week one
[6:51] week left after the massage cut off I
[6:54] don't know I don't see where they don't
[6:55] understand that to look what the Bible
[6:57] says all right but what is it going to
[7:01] do is going to finish the redemption of
[7:04] Israel during those 70 weeks right kasee
[7:11] verse 26 and after three score 2 weeks
[7:14] shall Messiah be cut off but not for
[7:15] himself who would be cut off for us and
[7:17] israel and the people of the prince that
[7:20] shall come now that's a little tea and
[7:22] who was at Titus Titus destroyed
[7:25] Jerusalem in AD 70 Jesus told him when
[7:29] he was preaching the seals tune in there
[7:31] Matthew 24 he said don't be caught the
[7:33] city get out and there was no Christian
[7:35] caught inside that city they were all
[7:37] gone the women they remember they had a
[7:40] lot of reason they had to eat their
[7:41] babies and all that stuff goes Titus
[7:43] circled it he just stepped down and let
[7:45] them let him just absolutely destroy
[7:48] themselves all right because they turned
[7:51] them aside them okay now when we're done
[7:57] destroy the city in the sanctuary
[7:59] remember we talked about Titus he took
[8:01] all the menorah and he took all those
[8:04] things back to Rome the Catholic Church
[8:07] is sitting on all those things to build
[8:10] the temple with all right so he
[8:13] destroyed the city and the sanctuary and
[8:15] the end or else you'll be with the flood
[8:17] and then the end
[8:18] more desolations are returning they said
[8:20] the blood actually ran out of the when
[8:22] he opened the gates and when he
[8:23] Jerusalem they slaughtered and killed
[8:25] him on the blood just run out of the
[8:26] gates there was so much blood where they
[8:29] had killed all the people horrible when
[8:32] you turn word down and he shall confirm
[8:36] the covenant with many for one week
[8:38] because see we got one week left we got
[8:40] a seven year period left one week equals
[8:42] seven years so we got 17 year period
[8:44] left and that he is the H a little age
[8:47] and he shall confirm the covenant with
[8:50] many for one week so who's the heat the
[8:53] Pope the Antichrist after we're gone in
[8:57] between in between here and here God
[9:00] takes out a bride under the feast of
[9:04] Pentecost with just 7776 49-7 church
[9:07] ages okay then we go up in our Jubilee
[9:12] here I work not not anything to
[9:14] encounter our to believe years when we
[9:15] go up alright we go in a rapture and
[9:18] then God it turns to the Jews with that
[9:21] last week or seven years and he who the
[9:25] Antichrist younger from the co you say
[9:27] well that could be Christ he breaks it
[9:32] right here and in the next week he shall
[9:34] cause the sacrifice and oblation to
[9:36] cease God don't do something and then
[9:38] take it back he doesn't make a covenant
[9:41] and he breaks it well this man is gonna
[9:43] break it so they can't be another Bible
[9:44] but the devil okay and he shall confirm
[9:47] the covenant for one week so you got 69
[9:52] weeks here so there's get one weight
[9:55] left after the rapture of the church
[9:57] because there's no guards not dealing
[10:00] with the juice now as a nation right
[10:02] he's dealing with the Gentile once the
[10:04] Gentiles go up guard go straight over
[10:06] start dealing in that last week for the
[10:10] Jews and then the midst of the week
[10:11] what's the midst of the week three and a
[10:14] half plus three and a half the seven
[10:15] right and in the midst of the week he
[10:17] shall cause the sacrifice and oblation
[10:19] to cease for the overspreading of
[10:21] abominations he shall make it desolate
[10:22] even unto the count until the
[10:25] consummation and that determine
[10:27] shall be poured out upon the desolate
[10:30] and there's your 70 weeks a day so let's
[10:33] go back to here though because this is
[10:35] what it's for seventy weeks are
[10:38] determined upon the Jews and Jerusalem
[10:41] to do six things because what happened
[10:44] right here at the cross they cried let
[10:48] his blood be on us and our children so
[10:51] God quit dealing with oh sure he dealt
[10:53] with them as Christians he didn't deal
[10:56] with him as you he dealt with him as
[10:58] Jewish Christian because look the 120 of
[11:00] the uppermost old youth so he wasn't
[11:03] just said but as a nation as a nation he
[11:07] could deal over the Jews because he told
[11:09] him he was going to that's it you're
[11:11] done you turn me down I'm not dealing in
[11:15] the morn because this price is going to
[11:17] come and he's going to destroy see that
[11:18] thing's never been rebuilt since 80 70
[11:20] there's no temple over there wife's been
[11:23] scattered and destroying Rome has most
[11:26] of the parts to put it back together why
[11:28] you think that Covenant still be signed
[11:30] Rome is going to say here you can have
[11:32] your things if you'll give us a little s
[11:35] wrong don't ever give you something then
[11:37] and don't expect something in return you
[11:40] know so so seventy weeks are determined
[11:43] upon now people and the holy city to do
[11:46] these six things now what's the first
[11:50] now Israel transgressed and turn Jesus
[11:55] down at Calvary right but he died for
[11:59] them at count all right give me but
[12:03] these six things are going to bring not
[12:07] only the people but the city remember
[12:10] it's too is a two-part see we have no
[12:15] continuing City we're looking for a city
[12:18] whose builder and maker is God not one
[12:20] we built right but now they the Jews
[12:25] need a temple the total God set him if
[12:30] you get in trouble and you look toward a
[12:32] temple I'll save you remember that's
[12:34] what Jonah did in the bell
[12:37] well he turned he knew where that city
[12:39] was that some way somehow he knew and
[12:41] prayed and God delivered all right so to
[12:44] them even though they may be born again
[12:47] believers Christians that temple still
[12:51] got to be built according to Ezekiel 43
[12:53] 44 all right so that temples got to be
[12:55] built so seventy weeks are determined
[12:58] until it so whatever is going to happen
[13:00] this right here has got to happen within
[13:03] that 70 week period or that 490 year
[13:07] period because seventy times seven is
[13:09] for their name right remember in the
[13:13] Bible Jesus they told you said said do
[13:16] we forgive our brother seven times he
[13:19] said no he said seventy times seven he
[13:23] knew how long it is going to take he was
[13:25] telling Israel it's going to take you
[13:27] four hundred and ninety years to be
[13:30] restored back for me to forgive you he
[13:32] forgive important foundation the world I
[13:34] think I they got to realize it right our
[13:38] names are written allowed to apply for
[13:39] the foundations in the world but we got
[13:41] to come down here and realize all right
[13:44] and then received part up my brother
[13:46] tells preaching them but number one is
[13:49] to finish the transgression so let's go
[13:51] on our 1970 week's book to the sixth
[13:57] whole purpose was just end if you got
[13:59] your if you got your three books in one
[14:02] go to the six fo purpose of Gabriel
[14:05] visit that's the second that's the
[14:09] second book all right come see I'm gonna
[14:13] say paragraph 34 if you're in another
[14:17] book you all know what marine you gotta
[14:20] get in Gabriel constructions today on if
[14:22] you have a book like this is on page 51
[14:27] but it's paragraph 34 I want to read
[14:30] that just for a second it's 44
[14:33] someone makes 44 in that one all right
[14:36] 44 in the new book all right and then it
[14:40] plays 51 in the old book this book all
[14:44] right let Dawson's god I got this Johnny
[14:47] guy tale all right we're going to read
[14:51] it and then get started on the six volt
[14:56] purpose because I believe it's important
[14:59] because remember and here's a key
[15:06] because watch what we're going to read
[15:09] this is where people miss it in the
[15:12] message there's only seven years of
[15:16] redemption for Israel to be retained
[15:20] it's going to take four hundred nine
[15:22] years to get it accomplished
[15:29] Jesus preached three and a half years
[15:31] over that back there was no redemption
[15:33] here people in this whole 483 years God
[15:37] wasn't sure he was being with it but
[15:39] remember they didn't have a profit from
[15:41] right here all the way to here for 400
[15:43] years the people just did what they
[15:44] wanted a right so God was not redeeming
[15:50] Israel at the beginning of the 70 weeks
[15:52] but yet he began the wheels turning he
[15:54] acted for what God is only going to deal
[15:56] with everywhere in their city are in
[15:59] their homeland right so we have together
[16:01] on back here but when this event when
[16:06] did the transgression get finished it's
[16:09] only going to be finished in that last
[16:10] week it's but it was finished account
[16:14] right here you got to understand so was
[16:16] yours Jesus died 2,000 years ago but I
[16:18] got saved in 1998 that's when I realized
[16:23] it okay 1998 year later right the same
[16:30] way with my brother and said Jesus died
[16:32] here for Israel baby wasn't applied why
[16:34] they rejected him they said let his
[16:36] blood be on us on our children that was
[16:38] the great transgression in sin and
[16:40] iniquity that created them Jesus
[16:44] actually did come to the Jews out of
[16:47] that Old Testament Jesus came right to
[16:48] the Jews he said I'm only going to the
[16:50] Jew well now he was doing two things he
[16:54] was saving both groups but he has to
[16:57] save Israel as a nation and Gentiles as
[17:00] a people okay he knew Israel wasn't sure
[17:05] they'd accept him as a nation only as
[17:08] individuals at that time remember he's
[17:11] when it wrote that script that's right
[17:15] Jesus in the form of the Holy Ghost
[17:17] wrote that script or through Daniel okay
[17:20] so he wasn't he wasn't surprised when he
[17:25] would read the Old Testament okay no he
[17:28] would read it and he said this day the
[17:30] scripture fulfilled right he knew what
[17:32] part he was to play in the Bible sure he
[17:36] didn't know about his coming why why do
[17:38] you know why was coming
[17:39] it is anything about any old testament
[17:42] to that degree it expels more into the
[17:46] New Testament right first Thessalonians
[17:48] second Thessalonians all in them Lord
[17:50] shall descend from heaven with a shout
[17:51] boys from RJ RJ arc angel but most of
[17:55] your old testament was what God trying
[17:57] to deal with Israel our always speaks
[17:59] about Gentiles coming in every once in a
[18:01] while but not like Israel then that
[18:03] Israel is the one he was looking for to
[18:05] begin with and then they what they
[18:07] transgressed okay there by all right
[18:10] with that we're to a point right here
[18:11] too we're gonna started dealing with him
[18:13] by bringing them back sure but he didn't
[18:16] finish your transmission in this part
[18:18] here nobody got that he finished it at
[18:25] Calvary but it wasn't applied so there's
[18:28] got to be that one week left to apply
[18:31] this six full purpose so I say the six
[18:33] full purpose will show you what's going
[18:36] to happen in that last week according to
[18:41] the Bible what about alright so now
[18:44] let's read one's probably said paragraph
[18:45] 34 in the stage for purpose says and we
[18:48] do understand that the city everybody
[18:50] got that that where everybody is okay
[18:55] everybody got you got okay all right
[19:02] okay and we do understand that that city
[19:07] which is now being occurs for two
[19:09] thousand years will be rebuilt and
[19:11] re-established again and the temple
[19:13] worship will be set up just like it was
[19:15] in the beginning that's right Jerusalem
[19:17] would be there'll be a sacrifice daily
[19:19] oblation offered again just like it was
[19:20] in the beginning okay nice talking about
[19:23] the Jews not 144,000 thereby understand
[19:25] that for 144,000 that's why they get mad
[19:29] and killed 144,000 feel they say we
[19:32] don't need that anymore all right now
[19:38] all right look let's read well let's
[19:40] keep reading 35 now I want you to know
[19:41] friend that striking on these things I'm
[19:44] certainly leaving out weeks of teaching
[19:45] but just kind of hitting that so that
[19:47] when the weather cools off a little
[19:48] later we'll get into the seals to buy
[19:50] all the trumpets all these things that I
[19:51] can refer back and say do you remember
[19:53] on the damaged every two weeks and he
[19:55] does that in sealed he said do you
[19:56] remember damage them to wait this is why
[19:58] we had to do talk about 9-10 the week he
[20:00] never said in the seals this is why I
[20:02] was wrong and am saying the weeks and I
[20:03] got correcting them all right do you
[20:06] remember the church age when it went up
[20:07] in that taken place and these seventy
[20:10] weeks of Daniel covers from the going up
[20:13] of the church who's that us until the
[20:20] coming back to the church well now we
[20:23] don't go up over here we don't go up
[20:29] over here we go all the way over here so
[20:35] he's taking the whole seventy weeks of
[20:37] Daniel and putting in that six more
[20:39] purpose in that last week everybody got
[20:42] that then you're going to understand
[20:44] that better when we get to that that's
[20:46] my brother ground come about Jesus is
[20:48] preached the first half a nice preaching
[20:51] the second half well he's not preaching
[20:52] the first half of any of this right here
[20:54] the word problem out it's inside of that
[20:56] he's showing us that reduction is only
[20:58] going to take seven years one week
[21:01] alright one week equal seven years go by
[21:03] and these seventy weeks of Daniel covers
[21:07] from the going up of the church until
[21:09] the coming back of the church hmm that
[21:13] space is what it covers now i'm now not
[21:15] all seventy weeks of Daniel part up he
[21:18] called itself and show that there is a
[21:20] part of the building up but really
[21:24] there's no redemption right here this is
[21:27] just getting the people ready just like
[21:30] in the seven church ages there's no
[21:32] rapture until the last church age but
[21:34] God's dealing with the people getting
[21:37] them ready to the last age we have such
[21:39] a fun day
[21:40] the weekend that we can live by so will
[21:43] the dude what these use that receive the
[21:45] Holy Ghost in that last week they're
[21:47] going to look back and think of what
[21:48] they're going to see all that where did
[21:51] you get those scars the Old Testament
[21:52] dip them too I mean the two prophets are
[21:56] going to be profit but they're going to
[22:00] go back in the Old Testament just like
[22:02] Jesus did on the road to mass he went
[22:04] back the Bible says went back and told
[22:05] them all about him through Moses and
[22:08] although they didn't understand he said
[22:10] old food and slow of heart what they
[22:12] have achieved whole don't yet they
[22:14] understand what he's known about its the
[22:17] message in Christ that's indeed impacted
[22:20] right three and a half back seat when he
[22:22] spoke correct Calgary that's right
[22:25] because she there was no message of
[22:27] redemption here this was the law this
[22:29] was one put you in jail there was no
[22:34] salvation in the law right nobody
[22:38] noticed the MacGuffin humor sure they
[22:41] were saved absolutely but they didn't
[22:44] have the new birth or they went acted
[22:46] like the deal all right but you still
[22:48] got see that the 70 weeks is getting
[22:50] them ready to come to calorie and and
[22:53] literally they turned all that down the
[22:55] counter so God said I'm not going to
[22:59] deal with you I'm going to deal with
[23:00] take a Gentile bride out but I'm coming
[23:01] back to deal with you to finish what I
[23:05] promise he promised seventy weeks are
[23:07] determined that's a promise of God that
[23:10] he's gone upon his people in the city to
[23:13] restore them back the man not too bright
[23:18] but to restore them back give them the
[23:20] Holy Ghost and put them in a rapture
[23:22] their rapture okay all right so not all
[23:25] of it part of it seventy weeks are
[23:29] determined now there's a six-fold
[23:30] purpose in this business visit telling
[23:32] him what was going to come to pass now
[23:35] there's a there was a safe full purpose
[23:37] of his coming right just like Jesus
[23:42] preach six seals when he was here
[23:46] brother Adam just opened them up because
[23:48] man had shut the book God opened the
[23:52] book through Jesus Jesus
[23:53] was the open book right Jesus was the
[23:58] open book he was trying to open it and
[23:59] tell everybody but they just kept
[24:00] happening night same way through the
[24:03] church ages he kept up revealing itself
[24:06] to certain people certain people would
[24:07] shut it up right now there's a fictional
[24:11] purpose of his coming now tonight I
[24:13] think we'll leave all scriptures are
[24:15] where he lets go him down seventy weeks
[24:17] are determined let's read the scripture
[24:19] he's reading the scripture here seventy
[24:21] weeks are determined upon by people now
[24:23] remember that is all that the journey of
[24:25] Israelites will have on this earth they
[24:28] are determined seventy weeks forgot that
[24:31] nine seventy weeks seven two weeks is
[24:36] just determined that's all that's
[24:38] allotted to the juice upon thy people
[24:41] and upon the holy city therefore now
[24:44] this is program problem therefore this
[24:46] seventy weeks now don't miss it it will
[24:50] reveal from that time to the end of the
[24:52] Jews and also to the end of Jerusalem
[24:56] until there will be a new city Bill Lee
[25:02] brings in the people and the city okay
[25:06] now hope we get into real good and deep
[25:08] tonight come on now this is uncle our
[25:11] determined upon down people and upon the
[25:13] holy city one to spread brown says what
[25:15] too so watch it to do to finish the
[25:17] transgression when he tell him what did
[25:20] he tell him now he was trying to find
[25:22] out how long it's going to be program
[25:26] from time at the end town Daniel was
[25:29] confessing to his people let's go over
[25:31] to paragraph 14 one let's explain few
[25:35] least when we go up now that was the
[25:38] sexual purpose of the visitation of
[25:40] Gabriel now let's start number one if
[25:42] you want to market you just got pencils
[25:44] number one to finish the transgression
[25:48] that's the first thing everybody got
[25:50] that here in this class yes
[25:55] now to finish the transgression of
[25:58] Israel who transgressed against God will
[26:01] be the turning away of the ungodliness
[26:03] Jacob now to find out let's turn to
[26:06] Romans 11 chapter and begin with the
[26:08] 21st verse of Romans 11 now we're going
[26:12] to watch finish the transgression and if
[26:15] God spared not the natural branches
[26:16] Romans 11 21 which was who Israel take
[26:20] heed lest also he spare not thee now I
[26:23] want you when you go home to read this
[26:25] whole dilemma chapter I'm just reading
[26:28] this so marked down the hole 11 chapter
[26:30] and read it brother I'm talking spare
[26:33] doubt they behold therefore the goodness
[26:35] severity of God on them once fell but
[26:38] toward the goodness if now continue in
[26:40] the goodness and otherwise now so
[26:41] because i'll also be cut off and they
[26:45] also if they abide not still and if they
[26:47] abide not stealing unbelievers you'll be
[26:49] grafted in regarding able to grab them
[26:52] in again see telling that there will be
[26:53] a time when the Gentiles would be cut
[26:55] out and here's will come back again
[26:56] because remember look this is me talking
[26:58] now the scripture says that there would
[27:00] be an in grafting of the Gentiles it
[27:03] would be a wild branch grafted into this
[27:06] what he's saying now he's showing the
[27:08] type that Gentile branch is going to be
[27:11] taking off and take it up and he's going
[27:14] back in with Israel again because
[27:16] remember he's not dealing with Israel
[27:17] now that's a nation okay here the time
[27:23] that when the Gentile will be cut out
[27:24] and Israel come back in again for if
[27:27] that if they were cut out of the olive
[27:30] tree which is wild by nature coming
[27:32] gentlemen of parentheses Gentiles
[27:34] princey and we're grafted contrary to
[27:37] nature brother Brandon this is his quote
[27:40] we were contrary to nature alien without
[27:42] mercy without guard no hope at all God
[27:44] by His mercy to give us a chance cut off
[27:46] righteousness row because the
[27:47] transmission then turns them aside the
[27:49] wild the tail olive tree and brought in
[27:51] a lot all the three contrary to nature
[27:53] know who you talked about us brought us
[27:55] in now let's talk about how you
[27:57] back out again and put an Israel back
[28:00] right now all right let's read on let's
[28:06] go down their reasons for I would not
[28:08] brethren that you should be ignorant of
[28:10] this mystery lest you should be wise in
[28:12] your own conceit now this is Paul right
[28:14] this is Polly book Roman the blindness
[28:17] in part happened to Israel until the
[28:21] fullness of the Gentiles come in that's
[28:25] my in your opportunity there all right
[28:27] until the paragraph 43 until God is
[28:32] finished with the Gentile Israel was
[28:34] blinded they went off into sin and
[28:37] transgression against God and because
[28:38] God blinded their eyes that we might be
[28:40] grafted in you get it 26 personnel and
[28:43] so all Israel shall be saved paragraph
[28:46] 44 God blinded them purposely for you
[28:49] and I they cannot see because blackguard
[28:52] blind to them and all israel true Israel
[28:54] shall be saved now do I understand that
[28:57] that's 144,000 not all of Israel okay
[29:02] true Israel okay what did the angle say
[29:06] glory to finish the transgression of
[29:08] Israel I've come to tell you that they
[29:10] will come a time when Israel
[29:11] transgression will be finished right now
[29:18] when is that going to be now remember he
[29:21] pulled them all over he pulled wall he
[29:23] pulled he put his hand over his real
[29:24] that's right yes blinded them yes I mean
[29:28] he came just by the scripture people he
[29:30] came just by the Word of God that they
[29:32] read every day in that temple and God
[29:35] purposely blinded their eyes so that you
[29:38] and I could come in that's right if you
[29:41] have a problem with that you can talk to
[29:42] God about though that's what the Bible
[29:44] said was promised mrs. C right right all
[29:48] right let's go to paragraph 49 save a
[29:52] little time here the only gonna get one
[29:54] done probably today I'm sweating like a
[29:57] horse up here
[29:58] God cut them off purposely and blinded
[30:01] their eyes so we could have a chance to
[30:03] see giving us an opportunity because
[30:06] we're blissing what's going to happen in
[30:08] this six full purpose is exactly what's
[30:11] happening to me and you what when he
[30:21] saved your soul he finished your
[30:22] transgression he made an end of your
[30:25] sins he made reconciliation for your
[30:28] Nikko's remember your sins is what blame
[30:32] on cross right so he's not just be
[30:37] speaking to natural people right here
[30:41] but he's also speaking to me and that's
[30:43] what my Redemption because remember he
[30:45] can't redeem Israel different than you
[30:47] redeemed us only only he takes them as a
[30:51] nation and us as an individual all right
[30:54] but we don't know how many god only
[30:57] knows how many Gentiles are going to be
[30:58] but you know one thing for sure once we
[31:00] leave this earth there's only one
[31:02] hundred and forty-four thousand twelve
[31:04] thousand from each tribe gonna be saved
[31:06] now that's just the way it is all right
[31:08] that's what God promised he would do
[31:11] okay because that's the nation the
[31:13] nation of Israel actually can be broken
[31:15] down to twelve tribes that's right right
[31:19] Israel is not nine tribes a try the
[31:22] Israelis 12 pride he told a friend right
[31:26] here at the arc thrift on this side of
[31:27] the art 30 on this eye dr 3m on this
[31:29] side of the art then you've got four
[31:32] heads of that of that group and that's
[31:35] what God wanted God wants order all
[31:39] right now better I 50 now remember he's
[31:45] not speaking of the Gentiles
[31:49] but truly i want you to see what do you
[31:53] do at your salvation he forgave your
[31:55] transgression made an end of your scent
[31:59] remember Christians don't have sins in
[32:02] their soul he made an end and Sam means
[32:05] there's no more alright sure but we have
[32:07] we sinned every day alright this got
[32:10] sins every day the reason I'm here and
[32:14] dying is a sin cuz the curse right all
[32:19] right anime Tran silly Asian for
[32:24] iniquity we knew better but we did it
[32:25] anyway that's what an equity is any what
[32:28] he makes reconciliation he reconciled us
[32:31] back passed out iniquity and brings us
[32:34] back to where Garden of Eden condition
[32:36] all right gents is 126 man you show all
[32:40] what well I hope we're living in
[32:44] everlasting righteousness my soul is
[32:46] that's right right look what I'm saying
[32:49] is the last three is in effect of the
[32:52] first three all right the first three is
[32:56] your Redemption the last three is the
[32:57] effect of God doing the redeeming
[33:00] everybody got that this is the this is
[33:03] this is the cause this is the effect
[33:06] okay the cause was he gave he just he
[33:09] restored us back complete Holden's right
[33:14] bring everlasting righteousness we're
[33:16] sitting in heavenly places in Christ
[33:18] Jesus honey still up to vision and
[33:20] prophecy guys think about the other
[33:21] night brother BAM open the seals but but
[33:23] he all but he also talks about sealing
[33:26] up the car and the Bible says you're
[33:29] sealed until the day of your redemption
[33:31] sure the seal is opened up but once they
[33:34] go inside of you the clothes you're a
[33:36] mystery so he God seals up the vision
[33:40] and prophecy in you that's what we're
[33:41] doing now alright and anoint the most
[33:44] holy it's when brother Brown says that
[33:47] Jesus Christ and the bride comes into
[33:49] the temple to a North to temple well

[35:28] not speaking of the Gentiles I'm just
[35:30] rowing this in here so you can see where
[35:34] the Gentiles had their chance but he
[35:35] come to finish the transgression make a
[35:38] finish of it what is finish means in
[35:42] okay when you finish something you stop
[35:45] alright paragraph fifty-one neff we now
[35:51] if we go back into Daniel again we'll
[35:52] find out that in Daniel if I
[35:54] the 24th worse all right to finish the
[35:56] transgression to finish what to finish
[35:59] Israel's transgression what is they
[36:01] transgressed it is to go against
[36:04] something a transgress against me is to
[36:07] do it wrong to me transgress against you
[36:10] is to do it wrong to you so Israel did a
[36:12] wrong to God and in this 70th week
[36:18] what's going to happen God is going to
[36:20] finish the transgression of Israel
[36:22] finish the transmission will be turning
[36:25] away the ungodliness from Jacob and when

[36:29] them will receive the Holy Ghost all
[36:33] right right got that yes let's just stop
[36:39] right there will we can't get onto
[36:41] another one okay but what's going to
[36:44] happen brother ground will go all the
[36:45] way back and he'll show where Israel
[36:48] said let his blood be on us and our
[36:50] children now if he said distally their
[36:51] blood be on us it would have just been
[36:53] that generation and God would start
[36:54] dealing be said on our children so
[36:56] that's perpetual generations right but
[37:00] there comes a time when God deals with
[37:04] the Jews when we're gone when the
[37:06] Gentiles are gone there's no other
[37:10] Gentile will be safe God is turning
[37:13] right straight and he's going to finish
[37:15] that last week yes to the Jews all
[37:18] hell's gonna break loose everywhere else
[37:20] but he's going to protect and be with
[37:22] those will approve that show and we'll
[37:24] show you in those feast days where god
[37:27] comes in and does the exact same thing
[37:29] he does the spiritually he does to them
[37:31] naturally ants fiercely fought on the
[37:33] earth so let's go
