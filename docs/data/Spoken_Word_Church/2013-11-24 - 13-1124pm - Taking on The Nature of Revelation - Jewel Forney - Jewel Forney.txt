this morning I'm getting wise as I know had enough service I was I done done that before yes sir so we we trust God that uh we didn't have to use our backup plan today so we thank God I'm going to go right to the word appreciate Brother Sam appreciate being here in the serve with you this weekend I'm going to go right to the word of God in uh in the book of St John the thir chapter in 1 Timothy the 4th chapter I'm begin reading at first John first chapter I mean first John the thir chapter excuse me what I'm saying first John St John St John I'm thinking about St John excuse me that's my bad amen that's the one I want must be that pizza amen praise God uh starting at the first verse that's what I'm trying to think about and it says here there was a man of the first es named Nicodemus a ruler of the Jews the same came to Jesus by night and said unto him Rabbi we know that thou are a teacher come from God for no man can do these Miracles that thou does except God be with him Jesus answered said unto him verely verely I say unto the except a man be born again he cannot even see the kingdom of God right and Nicodemus said unto him how can a man be born when he is old can he enter the second time into his mother wound and be born born born Jesus and they and and Jesus answered brother brother I say unto thee except a man be born of the water and of the spirit Spirit he cannot even enter the kingdom of God that's right that which is born of the flesh is flesh that which is born of the spirit is Spirit let's go to a first Peter I mean first Timothy the 4th chapter First Timothy the 4th chapter and it reads like this in the first verse he said now the spirit speak expressly that in the latter time some shall depart from the faith giving heed to seducing spirits and doctrines of devils let's prayer father help me one more time to yeld my body my mind my spirit my soul to you father speak to your people through your word we ask it all in the name of Jesus Christ now father just give us gr father in Jesus name we pray amen God bless you you may be seated one moment thank the Lord for the reading of the word of God this evening and we looked at the word of God this evening I took from the scripture here what Jesus was speaking to Nicodemus and Nicodemus came to Jesus by night we know the story and Nicodemus is literally if you notice what he's doing he complimenting Jesus on his miracles that's great he came to Jesus and he he said we that no man can do these Miracles except God be with him HJ in other word he was giving Jesus a compliment and Jesus never he just completely ignored what he said you know no normally when a man come up and would give you in a compliment about a a Ministry something oh yeah yeah yeah Lord been using this gift of mine but Jesus completely en know it and Jesus go right to the scripture man you need to be born again you don't need to be watching the miracle you you need to get the Life of Christ on the inside if I had a title this evening for a few minutes I'm going to use a title taking on the nature of Revelation taking on the nature of Revelation and the reason I took this thought because you know it's just one thing to know God and know that God is uh what God can do but there's another thing to know that God doing it in you so it's a not different than know that God can do it than know that God doing it in me so we want to me we we realized that was Jesus when Jesus was dealing with Nicodemus he told Nicodemus he said Nicodemus Nicodemus came and no doubt he probably thought hey man let me let I'm coming by Night by the way I want to let him know that we know that he's a man s from God but it was something all the Miracles he did they had set back and they had come to the conclusion hey God got to be in this man but because of their Theology and because of what they was brought up in they was not able to turn their heart to God and Jesus told Nicodemus what you need to do man you need to be born again how Nicodemus being a teacher a man well taught in the scripture he asked him a coral question y right can a man enter the second time his mother wouldn't be born again Jesus look at come on man you've been going to church all these years you don't understand the revelation of the word how you know what so you know what Jesus said you you must in other words Jes required him to be born of the spirit and water Hallelujah that is the flesh is blood that is spirit is Spirit but that we begin to look here I begin to realize in in the book of Timothy it say that many shall depart from the faith giving he to seducing spirit and doctrines of devils H so we begin to realize here the only thing that we got in this AG that make us different from any other age is the nature of this Revelation right I want you to notice here we are the only the predestinated hallah god called for this say is a group of people that have something in there that they can receive Revelation from God that God can speak back to you y God don't speak like you know in word God speak to us by Revelation something come your way God give you a revelation how to deal with it Hallelujah in other word God give us Revelation supernaturally that's his way of speaking back to us hallelujah so in other word he can be preaching you but one day and she sitting around and all of a sudden somebody turned on the light that was no accident that was God way of speaking to you that's way God speak to me you hear preach you hear teach or Sam teacher and he put all the mechanics out there and one day the light come on right and you said wow that's what I been I didn't I know I what it was that was the light H so that's God way of speaking so I'm begin to look so wonder why we need Revelation the point of Revelation is if if you do do not have Revelation for this hour you will not be able I don't care how good you is or how holy you been I don't care how long you've been raised in church if you do not have Revelation you will not be able to overcome the powers of hell am it would not do you would not you cannot fight against this realm with with with human ability that if you notice he would continually it was a reason for him and like God of this evil age if you notice in God this EV AG he begin to talk about uh he said as this modern This Modern na love love he said this Mo modern knowledge love and age people want knowledge more than anything else and I'm not I'm not not I don't support this I believe that a man I learn everything again if you know you say when I when I I I I used to when I first come in the message one of the thing they taught you don't need education well I disagree with that right hall if you want to get a job you want to be working in McDonald's all your life don't get none right Hallelujah words in that when you put you I but the point of is I believe that we ought to you know we ought to teach our kids to be educated but by the same token don't let that come against the word of God because you cannot know God by education you must know him by Revelation huah so don't let just get that so those that have been a group to come to talk this say how preacher rais the teacher you don't need no education you don't need to you need to be humble how do you don't need to buy when I first come to Mage one of the first things he t one thing they tell me don't you don't you go out here you buy the cheapest car that you can buy and all this stuff and I did that yeah yeah that was not that was not knowledge that was stupidity CU I ended up buying 10 cars in one year so so I really didn't G that by listening to this stuff but that's the way time you just need to be humble you got your car it's smoking every day you all a Simplicity no you always stupidity Hallelujah get you something that going to run you need to get to church how you need to get to work so that all those things but we talking about this knowledge love and a how did they're trying to meet Christ by how much they learn it is not given how much you learn it's how who do you know Hallelujah it ain't important that you know everything but you is important you know the alt it's very important you know the alt so he giving here he's talking about this knowledge loving Edge right knowledge yep and what everybody wanted you and you could have a and either you could have no better learning then no learning then the one they got Satan a perverter of the word of of God like he started off in Eden like he started off in the garden any but a relig religious person rely upon his own understanding so he taking it back he oh goodness man that's all right man iy well this good but you do like SS cuz they they come up with some good stuff Hallelujah I mean you can't put it out it's good or evil how so if you use it right it'll work for you if you use it against you if you use it wrong it will send you scra to hell don't pass go Hallelujah so in other words he said didn't could have perverted of the word he started off at Eden but a but a religious person rely upon his what own understanding in the book he as as I said before proverb 53 said that we're not to to lean on our own understanding what what we living in we living in here that everybody you come to they have studied and they have studied and they have studied but where is the life of God when peoples have come so close to this meure and begin to turn back and go back to the world giving heed to sedu the spirit and doct the devil all he had was a form of godliness and deny that Jesus Christ is the same as how we begin to look here let just take it let us let us look a little closer here so what I'm trying to get to why we got to have like I said Revelation because the bible say that the Gates of Hell have the Gates of Hell will fight against this thing and with that Revelation you will not be able to discern the spirit of this age now it ain't like it was in every age every other age and the darkg AG all they did was to say I accept the blood of Jesus Christ I'm going to die v Jesus they took their life and they went straight on in the glory but in this age yeah is more deceiving yes sir so this age right here this is a more deceiving AG because he said this is an edge when the devil have ped it up on the people and can make the people think they're right can make the people think they are Christian when they completely walking contrary to the word of this day so we got to finci and we got to realize here now the spirit we fight against I'm going to deal with it deal with kind of way the Lord show it to me the spirit we fight against is so deceiving it was only one one place in the Scripture it was ever mentioned you ever thought about that it was not a lot said about it the spirit that we fight against was only one place in the whole entire Bible this scripture was this word was mentioned you said oh man everybody thinking now he said yeah you said and wonder why it was not said a lot on this before I before before we read it I want you to understand one place in the Bible that this one word was ever mentioned there's no other scripture and there never anybody ever talk about it until a Prophet come on the scene and took prophetic insight and reveal the nature that was behind that word you said let's read it that's good let's go to Revelation find it myself Revelation Revelation three verse 15 and 16 let us see here Revelation three and I want to begin to read let me Revelation three first read he says I know that thou th thou or I know that thy works that thou are nether neither hot neither cold I I rather that thou was what cold or heart so because thou are what that is the only place you will find that word because that word right there was going to be what Satan was going to use the script the church for and use that power and he have done it amen amen because thou luk W need a hot not a cold I will spute thee out of my mouth Hallelujah so we R here there's a group of people that's in the mouth of God how a group of people will be that come to the point that God is for the mouth H but they never got in the mind because the bride is not in the mouth of God she's in the mind of God so now that mean that you can not respect a will in his mind but some group of people they made it to the mouth have tasted of the word of God they have tasted of the word of God and a evil is a fe of the mouth the mouth a prophet is a type of evil because he feed his church mouth to mouth amen yes right so we find here that word lukew now why that's why we got to have Revelation cuz every man going to battle that knowing every place every person have got to fight against that Spirit it been one of the most deceiving most concepting spirit in his hand it say don't care how he don't care if Satan can get you in a lukewarm State he will run you till you finally just get tired something I'm going to quit right oh it ain't nothing to it I've been in it all my life come on brother now you remember wine does not decrease in strength right the longer you keep wine the stronger it get but the power that we fighting against in this age N I couldn't get him to preaching get him to read so come on up here my friend he said man I thought I had it made amen now I'm going to we're going to read this here and we going to read it today we're going to look here we I want you to notice here why all of a sudden nobody ever T about this never talked about this but when a Prophet come he immediately tax this spirit because what is he doing he's coming again the gates of hell now people let me say it before we read I say people say when we think about the gates of hell we always got it way out here the gates of hell is way over here hallelu in other words we overcoming drinking we overcoming smoking that is the gates of hell that ain't cause no problem there but the Gates of Hell raised up in church we deal with the gates of hell if people that have rejected the truth or will obey the message that was Gat of Hell started Judas was a gates of hell and Jesus overcoming so we got sometime gates To Hell raises right up in the church right so now he goes to he deals with this let me show you another reason why Satan hates this book of the revelation of Jesus Christ in the church he knows that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever and changes know wait minut he know what mhm he know the devil's know d right he know that Jesus Christ is the what same yesterday today now we can get the people to believe that we're doing good right he won't let you believe it but he believe it he know that even one Lord one favor one baptis but he got the people believeing in three right okay he got it up there too you can read it they can read it okay he knows that a whole lot more than do 90% of the theologians right he knows that since God is immutable in his nature then he is just as immutable in his ways thus Satan knows assuredly that the original church at Pentecost with the power of God Mark 16 in action is the true church that Jesus claims as his own he got know wait a minute he got to stand that way by the way the same churches started there like he said brother like Brother Sam brother there had to be God had had a new creation how did Pentacost it didn't it started here a book of we got a song that's a brand new church raising up how the power of God has come back in this AG to produce the sa and the power of Pentecost back in the bride like it was then that was Christ in you the hope Glory by the way right it's a true church that Jesus claims as his own all else is false it has to be now remember this Christ in the true church is a continuation of the book of Acts but the Book of Revelation shows how that the Antichrist Spirit would come into the church and defile it making it loose ho m luk w yep now it's all strange he goes into this he looks him with proped insight and he hits the spirit just one word only filled in the Bible smoke showed in the Bible L one the anif spirit comes into the church defiling it Hallelujah not with drinking not with smoking if you that the church people a going to do that but he can make it luk one amen the five God dying out how the excitement the enthusiasm for the word is dying off the people hallelu and once he can get the people not being enthus about the word not being excited about the word hallelujah the church begin to get L war and people begin to drop off because they looking for some manifestation on the outside and the word receiving the word is a manifestation from the soul Hallelujah word your stimulation is not So Much from the outside the stimulation is from the soul the word moves from the inside all of a sudden you get all excited because you can see Christ coming alive not on the outside of you but on the inside of youen right Hallelujah making it lukewarm formal and Powerless powerless right now we got a problem right H every time you around every time I around every time I turn around every powerless a group of people that worship SL Ro more than worship God yeah now you know who that is that's the one I always say Wy Wy for good bad love I wouldn't have no lu at all that's right Wy Wy wo I don't think I can overcome this de right here it's beating me down this wearing me out I don't think I can do this I believe I'm going fail you right here in other word you are calling the revelation of God in a lie when you say I cannot overcome the devil and the power of the devil you have to say the devil has got more power God reation and then God his own word but if you ever get a true Revelation that God word would say I don't care what com your way I don't care what kind of trial you go through that God is able to keep you in any situation that's right amen that's right amen amen feel like I'm interpreting amen from Eng it exposes Satan revealing his works attempted destruction of God's people and a discrediting of God's word discredit yep that's it yeah make it make it lukew right well I'm in the message all you got to do is just yeah I don't see nothing happening in the word hallelujah in other words I've been reading it for years I ain't seen nothing we got a group like that right amen right down to the time he has cast into the Lake of Fire he fights that he cannot stand it he knows that if the people get the true revelation right of the true church uh of the what true church we must get the revelation of the true church H not a church but the true church you got a lot of churches around this message you got a lot of churches in the world how do they saying how you got you probably 900 something 50 different denominations or so and if it keep going it'll keep trying to make a denominated nation that is mess but it won't work in this no exactly no amen true revelation of the true church and what she is right what she stands for and that she can do the Greater Works amen oh you hear that M somebody going to have to come to that right exactly amen somebody going to have to come to that we got to fight this Spirit of this Edge right she will be an invincible Army that word means unconquerable amen how mean that somebody is going to Prevail over the gates of hell how they going to become uncon the Gates of Hell will no longer have any power any control over your life to keep you out of church how do it keep you away from God the Gates of Hell will not be able to stop you from praising God how they loving God how to walking in the word for your day how to dress right right amen but won't be able to raise up and do those things yep okay right if they get a true revelation of the two Spirits within the framework of the Christian church right and by God's spirit discern and withstand the Antichrist Spirit Satan will be powerless before her you hear that two Spirits M exactly two spirits that dominate the Christian church let look at this real quick amen two spirits that dominate I got some more for you read okay okay hold on Just Don't Preach okay yeah you put preacher behind the pool pit is danger but here we is two two spirits in the Christian church that dominates the great church when we look at those things right here it's easy to say what two Spirits dominated the Christian Church you thought about that what two Spirit by God's spirit it say withstand these two Spirits it a two spirits in the Book of Revelation that he really spoke against he spoke against nanism and Jezebel ISM right amen those the two spirit that dominated the church from the start how did ni is when the preachers and and and brother Dell know that it's the holy ghost that do the work but he know that if he start trying to control the Holy Ghost in This Church how what would it do it would defile the whole church because God would not give his glory to man so man begin to try to take a position I'm going to tell God what to do no we don't tell God what to do we get oursel out of the way so God can move in the church amen what it is said preacher a give get itself out of the way cuz if it don't get out the way it's you telling God what to do so brother and he preach or any other Pastor they preaching one Mo trying to get the people to see God not me it ain't what I say but it's what God Said in the word and I'm not come to preach my theology right exactly amen you know it's easy to come with your own theology you can build a fence around anything y you might say well this church is we better than any your church cuz we don't wear glasses yeah and everybody buming into the wall yeah exactly that we have that around the M somebody come up with some stupid idea that's right brother come on don't put on red stocking yeah what red St got to do with it don't start talking about red cuz I like red amen amen my wife that's only time we ever had a fuss a real major fuss when I painted her car r for her birthday I done that it took a long time to get this Spirit you don't pay my car yeah why don't want my car r I said think about the blood I don't want it so I told I I won't paint nothing this red so every time but the point of it is what I'm say they take they begin to take doctr and man become nickol controlling the People by a doctrine that has no scripture foundation and he control the People by it amen now jism right amen that's right is when the church control preacher right that's it exactly it's when the church control the preacher if he don't do what I tell him to do I'm going to quit paying TI I'm going quit doing this if he Don't Preach what we tell him to preach we we we're not going to obey we're going to do this if the church taking iron dis position over the word and no cute Spirit been around the church for years but if it ever of a woman the church that will find a position she'll come to church to worship God not to control the pastor right amen Pastor do things we don't understand sure but that ain't for you to answer to no right that's right that's up to God that's right brother you know a lot of time people get them oh I don't know why the pastor doing this he done made me mad yeah he wore a green TI of church yeah yeah yeah it don't matter if he were a green one or orange one right that ain't got nothing to do with it but people just just that way they want to control and that Spirit of control and he telling it he warning a two spirit he said by God's spirit raise up and deser if I'm getting the spirit of Jezebel Ling on me let me get myself back under the headship of the word and if a pastor or any Minister begin to pick up Nick controlling the people they some preach to that I can control their minds yeah then you preaching witchcraft not do amen right anything that you control in mind is psychology which is coming under witchcraft influence I'm not come to try to control your mind I come to preach the word and if the word get in your heart it'll make your body do everything the word says that's it okay we dealing with we dealing with this Nan spirit I got to another one down by God's spirit discern and withstand the Antichrist Spirit Satan will be powerless before her right he will be so he will be as definitely Ted today as when Christ withstood his every effort to gain power over him in the desert right every effort every effort he control he wanted to control the word right he went out to try to do everything he could to get power over Christ in the desert he tempted him with Hunger he tempted him with with suicide and they also tempted him with the lust and lay on seal the spirit of this Edge right amen and he refused every one of them amen all right yes Satan hates Revelation but we love it with true Revelation in our lives the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against us want you to understand that the gates of hell right that's what we fight against every day amen yes sir something come against us you know a lot of time we think it's a person coming against us cuz you know the devil ain't got no body but your to you sometime you know the devil can get on anybody you say well I got the holy ghost that don't mean nothing you can still get yourself called up sometime and way you don't think of the Holy Ghost when somebody getting jump in front of you you're doing 50 miles an hour and something grandpa pull out doing 20 yeah don't tell me what you thinking cuz I think the same thing come on got that's right amen you know but that just what the point of it is we got to understand the difference between that we we we war against gates of hell and the gates of hell ain't some object floating around there the Gates of Hell got shoe Lea right Hallelujah we got to deal with it every day we rub shoulder with people with bad attitude every day but we got to deal with it Hallelujah and then if we let the gates of hell why people quit Church a lot of time because of people sure absolutely I ain't going back to that church no more I'm tired of that brother getting in my face I can't stand here then the gates of hell is prevailing right right Hallelujah if somebody make you get church and you Le the word because somebody in church made you done you wrong and you quit church then the Gates of Hell prevailed over you H and the GES of Hell have overcome you because now you going to go out and you going to become B without G Spirit right okay that's right with through Revelation in our lives the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against us but we will prevail over them amen we will y don't care how hard to test get it's getting harder and harder right peoples is raising up today because peoples is now raising up in this message I'm going to read also from the uh uh praise God let me find my play 3:25 in a few minutes Hallelujah so he going to show you here uh so we going to find here that many people what is they rejecting this this age what is the thing that going to get the people spewed from the mouth of God right we need to find what going to cause the people to get spewed out it a a few things that can get a man kicked out SP it out and one of the things is Jesus told remember I preach on names this morning H so we got a name we got to stick to how the Bible teaches us he that receiveth a prophet in the name of a prophet receive a prophet reward he that receive a righteous man in the name of a righteous man receive a righteous man reward so people getting cut off right right sure something going on right right you notice in this Edge you find out it's awful strange if you think about it it's awful strange out of all this time we've been running the message and this message run close together with two Vines all of a sudden in the message y not outside the message brother men is raising up now come on brother and said brother R the false prophet yeah right as over scen just didn't happen overnight just showing that somebody never was in the mind of God somebody got lukew and got spirited out right now I want to tell you what you say people what do people look at that lot of people is blinded by the human man and never saw God right don't be blinded by Brother D as a man because he's a man like I am I don't be blinded you well sister D got fult so what you got fult right how do we all got fult how the point we don't be blinded by bro I look at a man like this he might have be the just think somebody Church they so weak and they might not be the best of the Christian M but something in them keep them coming to church right you ever thought about that that's enough alone to give Glory it's something in that person how you might not be where he ought to be but he can't get away from it how every time the church do over he's sting back there and he might not judge it might not come when you think you ought to come but as long as he sat under the atmosphere of the word let him sit right there and let him have church I said but we we too worried about trying to clean a person before we catch him right right exactly too many preach think man wait till I get up behind that pull pit I'm going to cut that place down had I seen that woman back there with earrings wait till I get through preaching she'll be I'm going to smoke the place whatever you done whatever you done you ain't done nothing but run out of here I the word could have helped you but you tied to take it up on yourself I'm going to do it that's human effort human will and that's why people drove from the church a lot we think it's the Holy Ghost it ain't the Holy Ghost it's nism right amen trying to control somebody life but if it's the word of God preach the word if you ever get the person on the hook amen the problem that you never show the fish the hug right n you show him the bait and if he swallow the bait you got him on the hook how so you keep preaching and that person let God if he sat under the atmosphere now when it come time to deal with sin you got to hear sin right but we don't pick somebody out to try to pre personally build a message on somebody when they not even born again what you expect for Sinners to be right let me I don't know how I got on that go ahead but the point of this what I'm trying to show you but this this is what we a and to say and we a lot of time we are controlling the Holy Ghost and the control holy ghost is not in control and we think it this God and it ain't nothing but a spirit of Ni trying to force somebody to do something against your against your own will make them do it according to your will right right we want God yes that's right we want his will done in this church exactly not as our will Lord right but as thy will amen amen hallelujah is he going to go here so now we see this Angel reject him y now I want you to notice what that 325 okay 325 let me I got that orange Mark here but let me see right hold on uh I want you to notice here it's office screen like I said a lukewarm come over the message like never before right absolutely all of a sudden people's getting inspired mhm now the man of God went off the scene now people begin to raise up he's a false prophet he made this mistake he made that mistake he made this mistake and I I don't believe wonder what's causing that come on and then you got a group of people that been riding the mess of a year listen that all this junk on the internet yeah come on brother I don't eat beside my ear in the garbage can so they R sit there and listen at this perverted stuff defile their own mind because demons about words people when somebody begin to speak again if it was a truth and they had scripture for it one thing but when men begin to speak their own personality their own mind you better stay away from that stuff don't let a devil your mind exactly that's why we got people that walk with this message and walked away from this message because they didn't have enough discernment right listen to some man and they turn back and went to the same churches they come out of that's right that's going on right now y sir so people we better get on our toes yes sir this this the gates of hell ain't on the outside of church it's raising up on the inside of church H unconverted Minds people that hung around just like Judah how they waiting for the opportunity to try to crush God in now the point of it is you said brother JW did how do we know that you m true that's a good question mhm that's a good question right well let me say this to you I done been around I have tried the Baptist I tried the Pentecost m and all this but I had never seen the message take a produ a life to make a man live true to his wife till they die right right come on once I never met him had a message that t a man you even I'm I'm I'm not saying this all of but I ain't never seen a message had a life in it a revelation so strong that a man can live true to his wife the rest of his life it don't happen in the world right only play in other words so this is not the world tur of the G light right exactly this is not the G light right here this is the real deal right huah until death do we part this is a message that people could live together and made men men real men and women become real women show me and the word the can produce that you you you go you check out the Hedonism they always end up going if it they always end up going in some other type of Life still maybe having three wi yeah yeah he live three children three wives yeah yeah yeah but they don't work today right Paul man have his own wife right right so I'm not reading I'm just show you but made gentleman out of men right yeah show me yes sir I'm just read before we get read this a message that God use to defile these spirits of the day could pull a pull a drug at it out of the G right going straight to Hell everybody in the community talking to him talking about him I want myob he ain't nothing he ain't no good he ain't nothing but this and that and God reach down by the S hand of GRA and pull him up out of the G and and all filling with the Holy Ghost and that man under this atmosphere he can live holy until the day he di that's show show me where else amen a woman that was nobody come on now a woman that was nobody a Rahab yeah come on brother that God reached out and pull Rahab out Hallelujah and make a real lady out of it and put in the heroes of f the me a message that can do thing n there's n so we we dealing with this little one I'm not going to try to finish this today I thought I'd throw this at you and just think about it we are fighting against a hard spirit in this age because you know you it's so much the more you get the little more little war you get right you know a lot of time we begin to get a lot and we begin to uh we begin to come less thankful right H you know what it do is cool enough you get so much you quit thanking God why you know I'm not I'm not saying if God make you rich between you and God I'm not going to knock God Hand away but the point of it is you can build so much people get so much why would it's always great the people normally people that fall away and normally people that begin to gain a lot and all of a sudden God don't mean nothing right right the world begin to get a scroll hole come on that's right because this this is the Ed we living in it's the age of L womanness and that Spirit was not manifest until the last day Le SE amen exactly right yes sir right brother they said this Ed going to go broke y I beg your part if this Ed go broke the prophecy done fail cuz the

like I said brother like brother brother go they got people do this they got they walk they they they sacrifice and when they get to church the power of God always fall right amen something about this something I'm just looking at a few things let's just look at one of the Miracles happened over brother Godwin Church brother God has a sister walking remember this is Bush this ain't right cities right street lights right Night Lights whatever you got this is Bush right sister walking through the woods coming to the church on a little dirt pad when she get in there she didn't know that across the street at night what they do those black mumbl and cobas they lay across the road because the road is raring warm at night yeah so they just lay across the road and they get warm they laying there across the road is warm and the snake is a cold bloody you know he cold blooded so she didn't notice black mama was laying there she walked and she stepped on the snake you know what he did he bit her he bit the lady I think somebody when they prayed a little bit she kept walking and made it to church yeah come on that is totally impossible to happen a black mama B you you ain't got a few seconds and you going to meet Jesus where you amen that's right brother she met but it she sacrificed and because of her love for the word Jesus say if you stand for me my word will stand for you people worried too much how about what going to take place in the economy how we going to do this don't worry about the economy worry about the word say I never leave you forsake you oh Hallelujah I I better get to saving money what good is going to do how what good we need to say Lord let my desire right grow strong for the word when everything fail Heaven and Earth pass away but one thing going going to be Lord of Lord the King of Kings I we don't had a lot of kings that die we had the King of Pop the king of soul and the king of rock they all died but one king is still living the king of king and the of Lord right give me a few more minutes Hallelujah been preing 35 minutes oh that's pretty good amen praise God this one yeah do that one page 3:25 Church book now once again that spirit will come back upon another man just like before Jesus comes just just before Jesus come he will be a prophet he will be a v he will be Vindicated as such by God since Jesus himself in the flesh won't be here to vindicate him as he did John it will be done by the holy spirit so that this prophet's ministry will be attended by great and wonderful manifestations as a prophet every revelation will be Vindicated forever revelation will come to pass right wonderful acts of power will be performed at his commands in faith then then will be brought forth a message that God has given him in the word to turn the people back to truth and the true power of God some will listen but the majority will run true to form and reject him run to form right what have we done come to church that's right everybody formed something you know the word form me is something that giveing shape to something else Hallelujah something else the word trying to shape us into the word of God but we'll give shape to somebody else opinion over a Vindicated Prophet somebody raised up on the internet and say brother invol Propet and we got enough people here I don't know I guess I I can see where you right what you you wor about if you was in the mind of God you would be worried about that amen amen that's the P that got to the mouth right amen that's right we are not in the mouth we in the mou Hall so we dealing about revelation we not dealing what we here say what somebody else said that's mouth Hallelujah the ones that was in the mouth when Jesus spoke the word that was in the mouth he can SC them out but Peter was in the mou said who shall we go that has the word a word and the thought right amen H who where we go that has the word amen the word is in our mind we love God hallelujah when they reject this message and start not only is they going to reject the message yep message yep they going to reject the manifestation of the mess the bride right amen because she's the final voice right you know a lot of times you go around family and you go around people like when I go around a lot of time they say don't let Jews speak that raise anybody up in prayer say something they don't want me to say nothing and I'm thinking what's wrong because they don't want to hear the voice of God I'm not going to rebuke them just tell them what truth says hallelujah nothing first for the first time in all the history out of 20 30 20 uh 30 uh 32 years I've been serving the lord first time that ever my whole family ever come together is when my mother just died about about two or three weeks ago I preached a funeral Y and then all of them was there Y and they all had an attitude like he not like what we thought he was prob because somebody they hear somebody big mouth saying something about me that they didn't even know what they talking about just like they hear something about Jesus and didn't know what they talking about that why when Jesus come on the scene the people was the people quoting somebody mouth not the mind they said we not be born of fornication yeah come on that's said then they say that in the Bible we not be born of St John 8 they we not be for and fornication where did they get that from yeah they didn't get it from the mind right no they got it was somebody big mouth saying something about Jesus that they did not have no scriptures to support him show me in the scripture what it said he come right he was not born of fornication neither was he illegitimate right if Mary would have had something to do with it h and she was to Joseph J would have come by a wrong act right but he did not come by Mar of about man he did not have man have nothing to do with it he created himself and do it so now who can tell Mary she gave see the Holy Ghost hello mm so you see what I'm saying y this word right here we got to get we got to know where we come from right if we come from the mind of God that mean that we are in them forever ain't nobody going to talk us out of neither is God going to get once God reute you out right once something Le the mouth of God right come on according to scripture he cannot return back cuz only the Bible only say a dog return to his right right God don't return lukewarmness made him sick at his stomach and he sped it out that mean that he can never come back to it it can never come back it's done reject it in other word we other word he done reject it but the Bible says here hallelujah but the bride got the word in her mouth amen hallelujah so now if they reject when they reject God how they going to reject God he said the word of God now in your mouth when they reject the word You Preach they are rejecting the mouth of God amen and when God deal with your heart to quit dealing with somebody leave them alone right Redemption is off right amen hallelujah that's right going to read a little more there since this Prophet messenger of Revelations 10:7 will be the same as Malachi 4:5 and 6 he will be naturally like Elijah and John both were Men set apart from the accepted religious schools of their day both were men of the Wilderness both acted only when they had thus sayith the Lord straight from God by Revelation but both last out against the religious order and leaders of their day brother Bron never fight people no he didn't if you ever follow his message he never struck peoples he always struck the system righten your pastor showing you by teaching what he teach he show you that that system is the mark of the beast he only struck the Beast how that's what the word is for the word is des scrap that image of the Beast he only will scrip the sister because it was system has separated the people from God a false mouth right right that's it right that's it both last out against the religious orders and leaders of their day but not only was that so they last out against all who were corrupt or would corrupt others you hear what he says mhm men raising up y I'm the man of the hour yeah God raised me to be the prophet no God didn't he made you no he raised you up to better the word he made you raised you up to live according to every word that proceeding out of the mouth of a prophet which is the mouth of God for AG Hallelujah that why I said that despises Moses law died without Mercy because Moses became a major prophet for the you had to hear his voice told josua meditate right put it in your mind put it in your mind first right meditate day and night H keep it in you keep it before you what it is today it's too many things yeah so many attractions today it's so easy to get your mind off God right cuz there's a lot to do in this age Hallelujah it is a lot to do in this age Hallelujah you got so much going so much going on this day you can't you get up in

Africa I said y'all don't have to deal with this batt he said no brother you he said we are the very opposite he said what we got to deal with is becoming slow cuz we got too much time and then you begin to get lazy yeah so one end of the Earth is running wild with the like they saying like a chicken with his head cut off and the other landay on the CAU like a grasshopper yeah said they both is in bad shape right so you know go in the way he said we got time but we just get to the point that it become slow for nothing going on and brother samma tell you when you get in a bank especially we you stand in a bank in of Jamaica you might well car your lunch right right come on you that ain't just Jamaica that's any old country even Africa you you might well carry your lunch with you cuz

McDonald a movie hey that's American atmosphere I want to right there I want it right then but you remember because everything comes so easy everything come so quick it don't do nothing but weaken down your faith if God don't hear me right then I can't accept it right that's right but God trying to build faith in us right yes sir Hallelujah you know sometime I think sometime a lot of things happen for for for for a reason you know now it's over strange all of a sudden here go to here it come they trying to look like everybody going to have insur people they people they had insurance and all this stuff ra up H baby God trying to get people to start trusting God Hall you know and words you know it's so easy to trust everything but God hallelujah every time you ride down the road you ever thought about only this ede it had never been an increase CVS's rights pharmacies y everywhere you go is medicine you can't go to one town that it ain't somewhere you can get medicine what

pray for him Lord would give him strength and all going back home this afternoon then he's got to leave out and go to some more CU he's traveling so just tell him how much you appreciate him we do but church I've always told you one thing when the Devil comes in to beat you hard and try to beat you down just remember there's a great light fixing to open in front of you and you're the one that's going to stop it from opening so when everything starts going wrong you start worshiping I start looking when things start going wrong and everything going wrong I start looking right I start watching I pray I read I study I'm watching cuz something's fixing to unfold you see Satan knows he knows things and he's going to try his best to hinder us to keep us from being amen right at the right time so when you start seeing it going wrong to start saying well praise the Lord praise the Lord something's coming praise the Lord you know what you'll just praise the Lord right into whatever's coming you see that's that's the way we ought to do CU it'll always work it has for me all of the ministry I've had that's worked that when I know the devil's fighting it I know that I'm doing right if he ain't fighting me I start checking that out because I figure that's something wrong I've got on his side somewhere so I start struggling you know see if to call us it's all in a Christian Life tell brother fory how much you appreciate it amen I just pray that the Lord would bless and guide each one now the sisters will be the men will be taking the children outside and all and and doing and keep put them out of there and the sisters are going to be having a shower our sister back there and we pray that the Lord would be with the little child and they know now what it's going to be so they can
