[0:00] foreign
[0:30] such as
[0:36] life to suffer shame and such disgrace
[0:47] my place
[0:50] that I ask myself
[0:54] this question
[0:58] my
[1:02] who am I
[1:06] that the king would bleed and die for
[1:15] who am I that he would pray not my will
[1:23] thy Lord
[1:26] the answer
[1:29] I may never know
[1:34] why he ever loved me so
[1:40] that's an Old Rugged Cross
[1:45] he would go for who am I
[1:53] well I'm
[1:55] reminded over his words
[2:00] I Leave You Never
[2:05] if you'll be true
[2:09] I'll give to you
[2:13] lie forever
[2:18] I wonder what
[2:22] I could have done
[2:26] to deserve God's only son on to fight my
[2:35] battles until they're one for who am I
[2:46] who am I
[2:49] that the king would bleed and die for
[2:58] who am I that he would pray not my will
[3:06] die
[3:08] Lord
[3:10] the answer
[3:13] I may never know
[3:18] why he ever loved me so
[3:24] that to an Old Rugged Cross
[3:29] he would go for who am I
[3:37] who am I
[3:40] that the king would bleed and die for
[3:48] who am I that he would pray
[3:54] not my will dying Lord
[4:00] the answer
[4:02] I may never know
[4:07] why here
[4:10] you loved me so
[4:14] that to that Old Rugged Cross
[4:18] he would go for who am I
[4:27] that to that Old Rugged Cross
[4:31] he would go for who
[4:35] who am I
[4:44] am
[4:47] watching
[4:50] big things come in small packages
[4:53] as a blessing
[5:11] there's a voice
[5:14] calling me
[5:22] and it Whispers
[5:24] draw closer to me
[5:31] like the world for
[5:34] me
[5:36] there are new highs to climb in a new
[5:43] life in
[5:46] Mirror we'll find
[5:51] for whatever
[5:53] it takes
[5:55] to draw closer to you Lord

[6:10] and whatever
[6:12] it takes
[6:15] to be more like you

[6:29] take the dearest thing to me
[6:34] if that's how it must be
[6:39] to Draw Me Closer
[6:43] to this
[6:48] let the
[6:51] disappointments come
[6:53] lonely days without the sunny
[6:58] through sorrow
[7:00] or like
[7:02] I'll become
[7:07] I'll drink
[7:09] Sunshine for rain
[7:12] my comfort
[7:14] for pain
[7:17] that's what I'll be willing to do
[7:25] for whatever

[14:27] we always do but if you'd like turning
[14:28] your scriptures turn to Hebrews 12
[14:31] where we were this morning to try to
[14:33] continue our thought and remember like
[14:35] sister Gayle and brother dick them
[14:37] traveling back and finishing up Darren
[14:40] getting coming in back home and remember
[14:42] each one of these that the Lord would
[14:44] would bless each and every one Hebrews
[14:46] 12 right
[14:48] the heavenly father we thank you for all
[14:51] things we thank you for your love and
[14:52] your grace unto us we thank you for
[14:55] Calvary thank you for all that you've
[14:58] made manifest into our hearts and our
[15:00] lives and we just ask you to come now
[15:02] and speak to us Lord that your love may
[15:05] be made made to the point that it would
[15:08] be the only thing that we would desire
[15:10] is to satisfy you and your grace and
[15:13] love have your way with each and every
[15:15] one remember those that are traveling
[15:17] remember the different ones and already
[15:19] remember the the Gabriel family there
[15:21] and the loss of the loved one Lord and
[15:23] just have your way forgive our sins and
[15:26] lead us by thy Grace and love in Jesus
[15:28] name
[15:29] amen
[15:30] Hebrews
[15:32] 12. you notice we got out of chapter 11
[15:35] so
[15:36] we're doing pretty good
[15:39] only took 28 messages to get out of
[15:41] there
[15:42] okay
[15:44] we're foreseeing
[15:46] we also are compassionate about we're so
[15:49] great a clouded Witnesses
[15:51] let us lay aside ever
[15:53] wait and the sin which does easily beset
[15:56] us and let us run with patience the race
[15:59] that is set before us
[16:01] looking unto Jesus the author and
[16:03] finisher of our faith who for the joy
[16:06] that was set before him endured the
[16:09] cross despising the shame and is set
[16:12] down at the right hand of the Throne of
[16:14] God
[16:15] you may be seated to where that is
[16:17] blessing to the reading of the word now
[16:22] I hope
[16:25] that
[16:26] we put in enough
[16:29] to get an understanding
[16:31] of what we were talking about this
[16:33] morning
[16:34] and to let you know what I believe at
[16:37] least and the things that I speak of
[16:41] that I believe all
[16:43] back that away as far as you can go back
[16:46] to Adam
[16:49] and as far as you can go over that way
[16:51] to where the lice group would be
[16:54] um probably foolish virgins at the white
[16:57] Throne or something I wouldn't know the
[16:58] last
[17:00] but everything is dependent upon you and
[17:04] I
[17:05] and you say well I just don't know where
[17:07] there's anything going on well that's
[17:08] for me to realize that
[17:12] that ought to make a thrill into our
[17:14] hearts and a thought
[17:16] that Lord we found our place
[17:19] we found Who We Are
[17:21] and we found what you've done you
[17:23] reserve the best to last
[17:26] which is us
[17:28] and his bride is the one that he's
[17:30] putting everything into
[17:32] and that his bride is he himself made
[17:35] manifest
[17:37] so it's not talking about waiting on you
[17:39] and I as peoples or as that it's waiting
[17:44] for to you know him to come and manifest
[17:48] himself Among Us in US
[17:51] all right now because I don't believe
[17:54] anybody can raise the dead I believe it
[17:56] takes God to raise the dead I don't
[17:58] believe there's anybody that the body
[18:00] could be changed I believe take God to
[18:01] change the body you know and all of that
[18:04] but that away see then I can say they
[18:07] without us
[18:09] you know cannot come to a completed
[18:11] state of what they desire to
[18:16] you know in all
[18:18] because of us you know they couldn't
[18:21] come to it but because of us now the
[18:23] opportunity is for them and like I was
[18:27] quoting this morning that wrote around
[18:29] said we fall right in line
[18:31] all right you can't put things in order
[18:34] of you know this or that because here we
[18:37] are in the middle
[18:40] and because of us being here that can
[18:44] take place on past here
[18:46] all right and because of us accepting
[18:49] Christ and becoming what he wants then
[18:52] all that was back there can come forth
[18:54] now I know that that's a thought that's
[18:57] going about I've heard it later other
[18:59] than the ones that we know of that was
[19:02] speaking of the Old Testament Saints you
[19:05] know that they would uh they raised back
[19:07] there totally Body Spirit Soul you know
[19:10] in a in a physical body
[19:14] and I believe the prophet in what he's
[19:16] saying about it
[19:18] but I also believe that you said some
[19:20] other things so I just stay with that
[19:23] until it's revealed and then when it is
[19:25] I don't have to worry about it you know
[19:27] you know but I still say that whatever
[19:29] is totally hinged or dependent upon you
[19:33] and I
[19:34] to become what this Prophet has spoken
[19:37] of
[19:38] to show what he would think of the Bride
[19:41] here in the end time and the position
[19:44] she's in and what age would we want to
[19:47] live in
[19:49] it should be like the prophet said when
[19:52] he said if I was asked what age he said
[19:54] I'd want to live and be in this age all
[19:57] right that should be our desire
[19:59] is to live right here because we're
[20:01] going to see something take place
[20:05] to the bride but now the rest won't
[20:08] you know the biggest portion of the
[20:09] people will never know anything's taking
[20:11] place amen and all that it'll just be
[20:14] right on secret Rapture quiet time and
[20:17] the rest will go right on brought around
[20:19] and said even thinking they're getting a
[20:20] Holy Ghost and things
[20:22] but said the Bridle doesn't be gone well
[20:25] that's all I'm trying to do is to strive
[20:28] for that
[20:30] you know of the point to where you and I
[20:33] will walk off the earth all right
[20:36] now
[20:38] I want to approach something in a way
[20:41] but my point when we get down to the end
[20:44] is what is the worst sin
[20:48] that could be thought of because it said
[20:51] that you and I now Paul's not writing to
[20:54] the world
[20:55] the Bible's not talking to the world
[20:57] it's talking to those that are in Christ
[20:58] Jesus all right and he says there that
[21:02] we are supposed to lay aside
[21:05] every sin which does so easily beset us
[21:12] well what is the worst sin you could
[21:14] think of
[21:16] the worst thing you could think of to
[21:18] hinder you are to stop you or to uh
[21:22] cause you to be destroyed or or uh
[21:27] anything that you could think of about
[21:29] what would be the worst sin that you can
[21:31] think of
[21:34] you know you can say well adultery and
[21:37] drinking killing and now just like a man
[21:40] the other day just
[21:42] berserking his mind and took five of his
[21:44] children out and killed him hauled him
[21:47] around in a car for two or three days
[21:49] you know
[21:50] finally throw them off in the woods
[21:53] well see You'd think well that's
[21:54] horrible
[21:55] and it is
[21:57] you know in any kind of kind of a thing
[22:00] that you could think of to be the most
[22:02] horrible but what would be the most the
[22:05] worst what would be the sin that we need
[22:08] to
[22:09] oh lay a shot
[22:12] now I can take it and go through the
[22:14] message and take hours over what the
[22:17] prophet has said on these things
[22:20] as to say in what they were
[22:24] and the little besetting sins and you
[22:27] know into different things
[22:29] and he even said I was noticing one he
[22:32] said there was Moses said the most
[22:34] besetting sin in his life
[22:37] was The Temper when he smoked the rock
[22:39] you know on the different things that
[22:41] happened said that was a besetting sin
[22:43] in his life
[22:45] all right
[22:46] now
[22:48] but we're going to get some things out
[22:49] of the way before we bring our thought
[22:51] to a conclusion as to what is the worst
[22:54] sin
[22:56] you know that could be
[22:59] all right now
[23:02] sin
[23:04] there's two sides or basically two
[23:07] issues
[23:10] of what we would talk about Sin
[23:12] all right
[23:14] uh
[23:16] we would talk about how that
[23:19] um one group would say
[23:22] I don't sin
[23:27] all right
[23:28] they got some truth
[23:31] then the other side of it would would
[23:33] say
[23:35] but I just can't help but sin
[23:40] yeah there's truth
[23:42] in the thoughts
[23:45] but now I like to find the middle of the
[23:47] road
[23:48] I like to know what the Bible is talking
[23:50] about uh when we lay out an order and
[23:53] speak of sin
[23:55] and uh you know and have it in the place
[23:58] that I can
[24:00] look at it and just someone say to me
[24:03] say well brother Dale said do you sin
[24:06] I'd say every day
[24:10] yeah but if you sin you're lost no I'm
[24:13] not
[24:18] see you're looking at it from a concept
[24:20] or a thought of what you've been taught
[24:24] or are holding you know to a point
[24:28] and uh you know looking at it and it was
[24:31] I guess in brother branham's day I was
[24:33] to me thinking probably the worst thing
[24:38] that confronted brother Branham I'm just
[24:41] saying for my thoughts okay
[24:43] I'd say the worst thing that confronted
[24:46] brother Branham was to try to explain
[24:49] about Sin
[24:53] you know
[24:54] because he could just go through the
[24:56] Bible and bring you a layout
[24:58] of serpent seed
[25:00] one God you know water baptism it would
[25:04] speak for itself but yet he would go out
[25:06] and he'd speak and he'd say you know
[25:09] talking about Sin and he'd say um
[25:12] my sins not drinking gambling and
[25:14] smoking
[25:15] running around with women he said that's
[25:17] not sin
[25:18] well not like the little old lady that
[25:20] was sitting there you know just took all
[25:21] she could he said one day and said run
[25:24] around them just what is sin yeah
[25:27] I mean if if it ain't a sin to smoke or
[25:30] gamble to run around with women or
[25:31] whatever murder or or he said she'd said
[25:35] what is sin
[25:37] see because she'd been taught all of her
[25:39] life
[25:40] that that's what sin was
[25:43] we've been taught all of our lives right
[25:45] sin is to do this sin is to do that it's
[25:49] a sin to do it here to Delight it's heat
[25:52] to steal and and we call it sin
[25:56] in a you know
[25:58] then you'd come along and brother
[25:59] Branham would make statements and and
[26:02] then we would question
[26:05] what he's saying
[26:08] but yet we would claim him to be
[26:11] the prophet
[26:13] right
[26:15] and uh
[26:17] it comes to my mind that you know like
[26:18] he said he said now
[26:21] it's not a sin to tell a lie
[26:25] oh but we
[26:27] been told all of our life
[26:30] it's a sin to tell a lie
[26:32] you know
[26:34] huh
[26:35] he say now
[26:37] an expression of it are trying to
[26:39] explain it
[26:41] he said a lie is more or less a part of
[26:44] trying to hurt somebody
[26:46] and said things could be said from an
[26:49] order that would not be hurting
[26:52] and said that wouldn't be called a lie
[26:56] but we've been taught a lie it's just
[26:59] anything contrary
[27:02] two right down the middle of the road
[27:05] you know
[27:07] what he said now like he said about that
[27:09] little boy that come up and said run
[27:10] around and said you was up in that
[27:12] mountains up there
[27:14] said we saw that light coming up and
[27:16] down
[27:17] he said no
[27:19] he said God I wanted to see what they'd
[27:22] say
[27:24] he lied you lie you lie
[27:29] well see what we've been taught is the
[27:33] point of hindrance
[27:37] all right oh do you believe brother
[27:39] Dallas a little white lie no I don't
[27:41] believe in White Lies black lives or any
[27:44] kind of do it
[27:48] but I do believe that there's things
[27:50] that we do and say that is not a sin
[27:52] that we talk about in our life
[27:58] but yet we look over at the other person
[28:00] and here I am with a problem
[28:03] when I look over to the other person
[28:04] that's a murderer stealing cheating
[28:07] lying
[28:09] and we say
[28:12] I'm not a sinner like that
[28:15] well it might be true you know
[28:18] but one of the emphasis the prophet
[28:20] placed upon
[28:22] what is sin
[28:26] all right
[28:30] and see if we get it down right and see
[28:31] what it is we'll see how everything ties
[28:34] together
[28:36] and we can get a beautiful picture of
[28:39] sin and what is going on or the problem
[28:42] and uh then maybe we can understand what
[28:46] would be the worst sin
[28:51] you know what would be the worst sin
[28:55] my brother Dale sin can't be forgiven
[28:59] blaspheming can't be forgiven
[29:01] Paul said causing them
[29:04] to blaspheme
[29:09] so you know if he's causing them to
[29:11] blast them he's doing a lot of
[29:12] blaspheming himself
[29:14] right
[29:17] but he said causing them to blaspheme
[29:22] but he said God forgave me paraphrasing
[29:25] it said because of my ignorance
[29:29] it's just putting a bunch together that
[29:31] he spoke up
[29:34] but what is sin to you
[29:39] see now Paul is writing as I said to the
[29:42] Hebrews
[29:44] and
[29:45] these are the Christians
[29:48] you're not writing to to the world
[29:51] the Bible's not written to the world
[29:54] you know it it's written to those that
[29:57] are in Christ Jesus
[29:58] all right
[30:00] now so then he said here
[30:05] that if we think about us being
[30:07] compassed
[30:09] about with a great cloud of witnesses
[30:11] whatever you want to call that
[30:13] whether you want to just make it the New
[30:15] Testament and a few little things it's
[30:17] still a great cloud
[30:19] I mean right
[30:21] if it's just say well it's not just the
[30:23] New Testament people it'd still be a
[30:25] great cloud of witnesses right millions
[30:29] of born-again Christians waiting on you
[30:31] and I
[30:33] when he said let's lay aside
[30:38] ever wait
[30:41] me the weight is something like pulling
[30:44] down pulling you know something
[30:46] and the sin which does so easily beset
[30:50] us
[30:52] talking to Christians
[30:55] all right
[30:57] now
[31:00] what is that worst sin
[31:06] now if the Bible is not written to The
[31:09] Sinner
[31:10] let's take him out of the picture
[31:13] right
[31:15] let's lead him out of the picture
[31:18] God has written to Christians those that
[31:21] are in Christ
[31:22] so then what we read in the Bible about
[31:24] those that are in Christ
[31:27] remember
[31:28] we see ourselves
[31:31] all right so now let's establish
[31:35] the point of what is sin
[31:38] and then we'll deal with the worst sin
[31:41] maybe surprising how simple it'll end
[31:44] but yet bear with me
[31:47] all right now
[31:49] I would say to one group of people or
[31:52] saying they hear
[31:54] and say
[31:56] you sin Tom would say no
[32:00] and they would take a great discourse of
[32:03] laying out the reason why
[32:08] that I'm under the blood I'm I'm sealed
[32:11] by the and God can't see that and all
[32:13] that would be well and good
[32:18] but you know I love simplicity
[32:23] how many of you in here don't raise your
[32:25] hand but just how many in here would
[32:28] agree that you need an advocate
[32:30] Jesus Christ the righteous
[32:33] is that according to John 1 right into
[32:35] me
[32:36] would you say you need an advocate
[32:39] now remember
[32:41] I do things deliberately
[32:43] okay so I just trapped you
[32:46] all right
[32:51] if you don't sin what do you need an
[32:53] advocate for
[32:58] okay are you with me
[33:01] you just agreed you needed an advocate
[33:04] well all right the reason you need an
[33:06] advocate is because of the sin
[33:09] now that should solve the problem of I
[33:12] shouldn't even have to express anything
[33:13] else
[33:14] you know
[33:16] that should solve the problem we admit
[33:19] we need an advocate and The Advocate is
[33:21] one who stands in
[33:24] place off
[33:26] because I've got problems
[33:30] all right
[33:31] now remember
[33:33] our Point through the Hebrew series
[33:35] we've been on
[33:38] Abraham lied give his wife away et
[33:40] cetera et cetera but you know God didn't
[33:42] see that
[33:45] he saw him stagger not
[33:48] at the promise of God to unbelief all
[33:50] right
[33:52] so then the things you and I do wrong
[33:54] that we would call Sin As Natural
[33:57] attributes
[34:00] uh
[34:01] I agree with you
[34:03] we stand and I'll give you the quotient
[34:05] of prophet perfectly totally sinless
[34:11] I don't know before almighty God
[34:15] all right
[34:17] but remember that's what God's looking
[34:19] at
[34:21] me we're looking at the rest of
[34:23] ourselves
[34:24] in being what we are
[34:26] so let's just think about it in that
[34:28] line now and we'll get down to where
[34:30] he's talking about Sin being unbelief
[34:32] but
[34:38] we could quote a lot of scriptures
[34:41] you know but it just got something I
[34:43] want you to deal with me on and think
[34:45] about it so go ahead and pull up number
[34:47] one which is first John uh
[34:51] 1 7 first
[34:53] two
[34:55] one is where he says that we have an
[34:57] advocate
[34:58] all right
[34:59] but look what John has to say to the
[35:02] church
[35:06] what if we walk in the light
[35:08] as he is in the light well fellowship
[35:11] with one another
[35:12] and the blood of Jesus Christ his son
[35:16] cleanses us from all sin now we love
[35:19] this part right we love the walking and
[35:21] the light as he's in a but then can we
[35:24] Fellowship down with where it says it
[35:26] cleanses us from all sin
[35:28] all right we've been down Through the
[35:30] Ages they got in their denominational
[35:32] form they called it omniscient and
[35:34] commission if I mispronounce those words
[35:36] you know you put it in the right place
[35:38] one of them is I meant to do it and done
[35:41] it the other one said I didn't mean to
[35:42] do it and just got caught with it all
[35:44] right but we're not even dealing with
[35:46] that we're talking about straight truth
[35:48] all right now watch what John said
[35:51] if we say we have no sin
[35:55] we deceive ourselves
[35:59] and the truth is not in US
[36:02] all right
[36:04] if we confess our sins
[36:06] he is faithful and just to forgive us
[36:08] our sins and to cleanse us from all
[36:11] unrighteousness
[36:14] if we say that we have not sinned
[36:17] we make him a liar
[36:19] and his word is not in US
[36:22] all right
[36:24] so now we've got to get an understanding
[36:27] in there somewhere
[36:30] about the situation of sin
[36:33] and you know and try to bring it to a
[36:36] place to where we can say this is what
[36:39] it is
[36:41] right here all right then we can
[36:44] understand
[36:45] now
[36:46] so we read what the prophet had to say
[36:48] we read the scripture
[36:50] Paul said
[36:53] I protest by your rejoicing which I have
[36:56] in Christ Jesus our lord
[36:58] he says I Die daily
[37:01] First Corinthians 15 31.
[37:04] he said I Die daily
[37:08] now
[37:11] was Paul talking about that he sinned
[37:15] in which way was it
[37:21] you know I love some of the writings and
[37:23] I get to thinking I'm sorry
[37:25] um because I'm just that away I get to
[37:27] thinking about those people
[37:29] you know Paul wrote a lot about us as
[37:32] human beings
[37:34] but you know really Paul never
[37:36] experienced that
[37:38] Now you listen to what I'm saying
[37:42] there was no blood of Jesus Christ no
[37:44] condemnation
[37:46] Etc to the life of the Old Testament
[37:49] Saints will you agree yes you know there
[37:52] was not a cross that had died and shed
[37:55] the blood and made it to that way
[37:59] so then Paul in explaining it then about
[38:02] the troubles and he says we had them
[38:07] and you said Paul now you never
[38:09] experienced the condemnation of Jesus
[38:11] Christ in your heart
[38:13] you know until he came on over to
[38:15] Salvation
[38:17] but remember one thing he did face the
[38:20] condemnation of
[38:22] Christ
[38:25] remember the Old Testament was Christ
[38:27] huh
[38:28] now what I mean by that
[38:31] a human being has a moral obligation
[38:35] as a person
[38:37] you're born that way
[38:40] uh it doesn't matter what country you're
[38:43] born in
[38:45] you're born with a moral obligation to
[38:48] do good because that's the soul that's
[38:50] within you
[38:52] that's right and you're answering to a
[38:54] higher being
[38:56] from that Soul that's within you
[39:01] right
[39:02] it even says as much as we throw off on
[39:04] job I'm not a joke but uh
[39:09] set it to the gate lot
[39:11] all right we talk about a lot and how
[39:13] bad he was but the Bible says that it
[39:15] Vex his righteous soul
[39:18] the things that went on in Sodom
[39:22] so now to be United Way I don't believe
[39:27] uh
[39:30] that he was a partner to anybody
[39:34] are we with me without having to speak
[39:36] too much time you know the problem with
[39:38] homosexuality I don't think he was
[39:41] experienced in those situations
[39:43] he said if x is righteous soul
[39:47] see what it was is a moral obligation in
[39:49] her to do right
[39:51] all right that would be the Old
[39:53] Testament form but then when you would
[39:55] come into the New Testament with it you
[39:58] would be the Christ that shed his blood
[40:00] for you and I would be the condemnation
[40:03] to speaking to us now
[40:05] all right and see then that way Paul
[40:08] would would be able to explain it
[40:10] so my point is is if you ever read the
[40:13] Bible and think about well Paul never
[40:15] went through that condemnation of Christ
[40:17] he did because of the moral obligation
[40:20] in his soul to do good
[40:22] so he could speak from that just like
[40:25] Paul could speak just like that he had
[40:27] been raised up just like me and you
[40:31] right right which really he wasn't he
[40:34] was raised up under the dispensation of
[40:36] the Old Testament
[40:39] which had no blood of Jesus Christ no uh
[40:43] things like that
[40:44] but it was a moral obligation in the
[40:47] human soul
[40:48] to live right and do right
[40:51] but just put that in a little bit and
[40:52] won't charge you because it'll help in a
[40:54] minute
[40:56] but you'd say Paul do you sin
[41:00] he says I Die daily
[41:05] Paul
[41:07] did you need an advocate
[41:10] yeah
[41:13] Jesus Christ or righteous
[41:19] now
[41:20] think about it then
[41:23] let's look and see what the prophet had
[41:25] to say and get on to just a few wordings
[41:26] of it for continuing for the faith
[41:28] number two of you note
[41:31] look what he says
[41:34] we're tempted
[41:37] all of us are tempted
[41:40] all of us sin
[41:43] well I got this other quote over here
[41:45] well that's all right hold on I'll read
[41:47] it for you
[41:48] okay
[41:50] no problem
[41:53] there's none without sin
[41:56] every day we sin you sin Paul said he
[41:59] had to Die daily
[42:01] all right
[42:03] if we say we're seeing and have no sin
[42:07] then the Bible says we make God to lie
[42:11] and we could not do that
[42:14] so we sin daily
[42:16] in his grace God's grace it saves us
[42:19] all right
[42:20] look like leaning it
[42:22] right
[42:24] then we go over the other way and
[42:28] lean it
[42:30] to say it's impossible for us to sin
[42:35] because we have an advocate
[42:39] and we cannot sin
[42:42] now you dropped off on either side
[42:45] instead of trying to find a truth
[42:48] in the middle of the road all right
[42:52] look at the next one which is adoption
[42:56] 1960.
[43:00] and look what he's talking about
[43:02] but you have sins
[43:04] he's talking about a sinner don't sin
[43:09] right he's just a sinner
[43:12] he don't have any sins sinner sins don't
[43:14] Mount up
[43:16] in any sin so much and then finally God
[43:18] decides uh well he's on 942. the next
[43:22] one I'm going to take him out
[43:24] he doesn't build up things
[43:28] he's going to be judged
[43:31] as being a sinner
[43:36] a Christian doesn't want to have sins
[43:40] come on
[43:42] put your sins you that's Christians
[43:45] you notice here
[43:47] he's talking to the church
[43:49] keep her straight it's easy forgiveness
[43:52] of sins s-i-n-s we commit sins
[43:56] but the sinner is just a sinner God
[43:59] don't forgive him
[44:04] God don't forgive a sinner why because
[44:07] he's a sinner
[44:09] he's not asking for forgiveness
[44:12] he's a sinner
[44:14] but they're not amounted up in piles to
[44:17] decide whether he goes to hell for 842
[44:20] but if he died at 841
[44:25] no
[44:29] he's going to hell for an unbeliever
[44:32] right
[44:33] is that the way we get to the point then
[44:35] yes
[44:36] yes all right
[44:42] so let's see what a Christian really
[44:43] does look at number four on adoption
[44:51] why is it each day
[44:53] you make a mistake
[44:55] each day you do wrong
[44:56] but if you're born again man or woman as
[44:58] soon as you make the mistake
[45:00] God knows you're sorry for it
[45:03] you couldn't stand in the presence of
[45:05] President Roosevelt or anybody else and
[45:07] say I'm wrong God forgive me for this
[45:10] thing why and ours were the blood atone
[45:14] notice that's s-i-n-s a sinner is a
[45:18] sinner he does not commit sins but the
[45:21] church commits sins does wrong and gets
[45:24] a wrong thought wrong impression make
[45:27] Scruples wobbles like a little child
[45:29] walking trying to learn how to walk he
[45:32] just don't know how to walk yet right
[45:37] go on to the next we'll get these out of
[45:38] the way and then I'll get back to my
[45:39] point number five which is Hebrews
[45:41] chapter 6. paragraph 262.
[45:48] perfected absolutely spotless and
[45:50] blindness
[45:53] not one sin on us
[45:57] okay remember
[46:00] the one with leaning us away we all sin
[46:02] every day
[46:03] now you think it's leaning I'm just
[46:05] illustrating God is not doing it
[46:09] now we're going to lean the other way
[46:12] I used to get so tickled at brother Mook
[46:14] talking about the uh the way
[46:16] sanctification came into being he said
[46:19] that they had got so far off on the side
[46:21] so he said it's like throwing them like
[46:23] he told Wesley a rubber band and you
[46:26] know how they'll stretch and then
[46:27] finally he just throw a rubber band over
[46:30] to Wesley and said you got a way off
[46:33] over here on this side
[46:34] you know because you had to start
[46:36] talking about doing and not doing and
[46:38] not doing and pulling back to the truth
[46:40] you know and line him up that was his
[46:43] way of illustrating which was a good
[46:45] point you know because Luke Wesley did
[46:48] come as a legalist
[46:50] and things but look what he says about
[46:52] now
[46:53] absolutely spotless
[46:56] blameless
[46:59] not one sin on us
[47:02] are we above temptation
[47:04] never
[47:06] do you sin every day yes sir
[47:10] but yet we are perfected because we are
[47:15] in him
[47:17] and God could no more judge us
[47:20] than nothing
[47:22] couldn't be righteous
[47:24] he's already judged Us in him when he
[47:27] judged Christ he judged me he judged you
[47:30] and he can't judge me again because he
[47:34] took my judgment
[47:37] if I've been redeemed
[47:40] trying to lean one way trying to lean
[47:42] the other way it's explaining it
[47:46] do we sin
[47:49] yes
[47:51] we are human Mortals
[47:54] and we do wrong
[47:58] all right
[47:59] but in God's eyes
[48:03] he don't see that
[48:08] right so in your eyes I'm a sinner
[48:12] you know
[48:14] I've seen you do so and so I've seen you
[48:16] do that
[48:19] but see God don't see that
[48:23] one because I've got an advocate
[48:25] one who pays my prize
[48:28] does it make it okay that I can just go
[48:30] out and just live like the devil no
[48:33] because remember
[48:37] you're going to give an account
[48:39] of the Deeds Done in the body whether
[48:42] good or bad
[48:43] if we don't repent somewhere down the
[48:46] road things are going to be brought up
[48:48] not as a decision of whether to go to
[48:50] heaven or not
[48:52] if you're born again you're going
[48:55] but then just remember what we read
[48:57] during one of the quote if you're born
[48:59] again Christian
[49:02] could have ran them in another time
[49:04] talking about it he said when you do
[49:06] wrong he said you immediately he said
[49:08] before you even cry out I'm paraphrasing
[49:10] it but I can find it he said before you
[49:13] even cry out he said God's already
[49:15] forgiven you
[49:19] because he knows what you're going to do
[49:21] he knows you're going to say forgive me
[49:25] all right so you really didn't do it you
[49:27] were you were trapped into it
[49:31] now that's the sin we talk about
[49:36] that's the things of life we talk about
[49:39] that we call sin
[49:41] all right
[49:43] now if I made an illustration enough for
[49:45] you to understand yes
[49:48] yes it's not that we just go out and
[49:50] live like the devil and say we're
[49:52] covered by the blood of he
[49:55] no you prove you're lost
[49:58] but when you're concerned with your life
[50:03] and saying Lord forgive me
[50:06] then we're falling into category of Paul
[50:09] who says I Die daily
[50:11] Amen brother random saying I see him
[50:14] every day
[50:19] I said I don't want to do that
[50:21] he said and I cry out and God forgives
[50:26] all right
[50:29] but you know what that is little things
[50:31] of life
[50:34] that's what we've been taught
[50:37] all of our life is sin
[50:42] I mean how many would admit since I got
[50:44] started you had a wrong thought
[50:46] someone said what in the world is he
[50:48] talking about someone's saying oh we see
[50:49] shut up I understand I'm sleepy and
[50:52] you're gonna wake me up if he talks too
[50:54] loud
[51:02] to admit that we do have problems
[51:06] here's what the prophet said he said you
[51:07] got troubles with a spot he said Satan
[51:10] has got a ripe
[51:13] to hammer you
[51:15] he said which would be better laying on
[51:17] a bed of Affliction or out over here in
[51:21] I forgot the illustration values my own
[51:24] over in Honky Tonk doing a bunch of
[51:26] wrong
[51:27] he said Satan's got a point at you
[51:31] and he says you've got to keep that
[51:33] place covered right
[51:36] so you got troubles with one thing
[51:39] and I don't have to tell you what it is
[51:43] right right
[51:44] you know what your biggest problem is
[51:49] right
[51:50] you just won't admit it
[51:53] well when you want to admit it God can
[51:55] help you
[51:57] well really God loves me so much that he
[51:59] don't care what I do now you're getting
[52:01] into stupidity let alone anything out
[52:03] huh
[52:04] but now think about it
[52:09] we do little things
[52:12] each day in our lives we have wrong
[52:15] thoughts
[52:16] we have different things you know the
[52:19] Bible does say that be angry
[52:22] and sin not
[52:28] when I thought angry was sin
[52:31] now the scripture is defining between
[52:34] two things and it says be angry
[52:37] and sin not
[52:43] they turned around read from Brother
[52:45] random war that Jesus drove him out of
[52:46] the temple and said Jesus got angry
[52:51] now you're going to say that he sinned
[52:55] no because he was fulfilling the
[52:57] scripture he was a deacon he was driving
[52:59] out the money changers he was taking
[53:01] care of his job
[53:02] right
[53:04] all right
[53:06] see then we better get away from a
[53:08] Little Talks Of Life
[53:10] you know
[53:12] we have an advocate
[53:16] now I wanted to find something right
[53:18] here
[53:19] real careful for you to think of
[53:23] an advocate is one who covers for the
[53:26] things you do
[53:30] okay
[53:32] we do wrong we have an advocate
[53:34] to cover that
[53:37] we repent it takes care of it
[53:40] we'll have no more problems
[53:42] all right
[53:45] but those are little things of life
[53:51] brother random told a brother that won't
[53:54] call his name because I'm trying to get
[53:56] away from that but he said you were born
[53:58] like under a two in your your new birth
[54:01] put you under a four he said you'll
[54:03] fight your nature all of your life
[54:06] well I agree with that 100 percent
[54:11] because you're going to fight your
[54:12] nature
[54:15] that's right right you're going to fight
[54:16] it you're going to have problems with
[54:18] your nature
[54:21] and somebody does something wrong to you
[54:23] you're going to raise up
[54:26] right
[54:28] but the difference in the two is what
[54:30] when you raise up immediately
[54:34] The Advocate says wait a minute
[54:37] it's not right for a Christian so then
[54:39] you put it back down
[54:41] but if you just let it run off
[54:45] the Bible says Don't let
[54:47] the sun go down on your Wrath
[54:51] that's still in the same scriptures
[54:52] right in there where he's talking about
[54:56] be angry and sin not
[54:58] don't let the sun go down on your right
[55:00] what's he talking about
[55:02] you're talking about the same thing I've
[55:04] always tried to explain to you right
[55:07] see
[55:09] Wade does something to me
[55:13] or I do something to him you know
[55:16] and then you know in a little while
[55:19] if I don't get that straight you know
[55:21] what will happen I'll start thinking it
[55:24] was his fault anyway
[55:27] he caused it
[55:29] and you know for the day's over
[55:31] he owes me an apology
[55:34] I don't owe him one
[55:37] I get brought out what was in him
[55:43] really good ain't it
[55:46] okay
[55:48] but is that true
[55:50] so don't let the sun go down on your
[55:52] Wrath
[55:54] be angry and sin not there's a
[55:57] possibility of having anger
[56:00] get them back up
[56:05] oh but I don't have no anger
[56:10] what do you need temperaments in the
[56:13] Statue of a perfect man after you're
[56:15] born again
[56:17] okay
[56:20] all right
[56:23] are you following me
[56:27] but the little things of life
[56:32] anger malice descent to hatreds or
[56:35] something little parts that still dang
[56:38] alone to us
[56:40] you know the one that has amazed me how
[56:42] did a man could take a scripture
[56:44] and he could explain that you are
[56:46] totally born again
[56:51] and then he'd turn around and he'd say
[56:53] there's doors
[56:55] indoors
[56:57] he said you open the door you haven't
[57:00] listened to those messages
[57:02] if I was you I'd put it down and go home
[57:04] I'd listen to him doors and doors
[57:07] he said we got this little door over
[57:09] here
[57:11] yeah he's talking about a born-again
[57:13] Christian
[57:15] that he's already entered the heart
[57:17] as a new bird
[57:18] but he said we got this little door of
[57:20] pride
[57:23] he said you're not getting in there
[57:26] we'll see
[57:27] that's the things we got to open the
[57:29] door that he can clean out right
[57:32] but I'm trying to make a point and I
[57:35] know it's slow forgive me
[57:37] because this point is vital to the next
[57:39] stage it will drop
[57:42] the things we do in life of wrong things
[57:46] you know we got a little temper we got a
[57:49] little problem we got a little dish we
[57:51] got a little of that
[57:52] you know and we do a little something
[57:55] and somebody'll say well you're not done
[57:57] now
[57:58] well you do it too
[58:02] I've seen you do more than I done
[58:05] well now that's bringing out another one
[58:07] of them doors that needs to be worked on
[58:09] because what does it matter
[58:11] what
[58:13] the other person does
[58:15] you know we're supposed to be concerned
[58:17] about ourselves
[58:19] right there's no perfection in me
[58:21] getting you lined up
[58:24] right
[58:25] it's in getting this old boy all right
[58:28] so now we're developing that there are
[58:31] things of life
[58:35] that are covered by the blood of Jesus
[58:38] Christ
[58:39] but we still need to repent and get rid
[58:41] of it we need to cover those things come
[58:43] down through the statue of a perfect man
[58:44] and the different things to get rid of
[58:46] those things we need to do that
[58:49] but now all right
[58:51] everybody with me
[58:53] now let's turn around
[58:55] all right
[58:58] I get tickled it
[59:02] I can't never remember names but
[59:04] brother Louise's wife
[59:07] Christine okay
[59:10] she's been riding on the the things I
[59:12] preached on the field of life and today
[59:14] about it
[59:15] if you wanted to know something about
[59:16] the seals just go ask sister Francine
[59:20] because she spent I don't know how many
[59:22] years
[59:25] transcribing to take that off from tape
[59:27] and put it down to where it's going to
[59:29] be putting a book for him Brother Martin
[59:31] him's paying for it here
[59:33] you know
[59:34] for her to do that and she probably
[59:36] knows a lot about me then
[59:39] and she knows when I come up to say
[59:40] something her mind's clicking that's on
[59:43] page 43.
[59:45] Brother Gary used to say brother Dale
[59:48] when you say something I know what page
[59:50] you're on
[59:52] you know because he listens so much
[59:55] okay now we're going to click
[1:00:00] get away from that that's
[1:00:02] little things that are dealt with in
[1:00:05] life
[1:00:06] that we need to repent right
[1:00:09] now everybody followed me we need to
[1:00:11] repent we need to work on them things
[1:00:14] because that's natural things of life
[1:00:17] but that's not what sin is
[1:00:20] right that's why your Prophet kept
[1:00:22] trying to Define that
[1:00:26] he kept trying to Define to us that sin
[1:00:29] wasn't drinking gambling and smoking
[1:00:31] running around with women
[1:00:36] what did he say sin was
[1:00:39] okay
[1:00:41] let's read a few and hold it points go
[1:00:43] to number six
[1:00:44] which is Ministry explained
[1:00:47] 1950.
[1:00:49] what is sin
[1:00:53] what is sin he said
[1:00:56] not drinking or smoking or gambling
[1:00:59] or rejecting Church
[1:01:04] sin is unbelief
[1:01:07] is that right
[1:01:09] he that believeth not is condemned
[1:01:11] already
[1:01:12] it's a sinner
[1:01:14] so you're not you you do
[1:01:16] you're not destroyed or separated from
[1:01:19] God because you're a sinner
[1:01:22] everyday life this that or the other
[1:01:26] it doesn't separate you because you have
[1:01:28] an advocate
[1:01:31] you repent
[1:01:32] you're lined back up
[1:01:34] that doesn't separate it you're not
[1:01:36] destroyed or separated from God because
[1:01:38] you're a sinner
[1:01:41] you're separated from God
[1:01:43] from God because you refuse to walk with
[1:01:46] him the walk in his provided way
[1:01:50] now what is his provided way
[1:01:56] look at Elijah in a meal offering
[1:01:58] recent 1960.
[1:02:04] paragraph 136.
[1:02:08] he would have slew cyber right
[1:02:11] then for doubting
[1:02:17] what I want you to do sometimes just
[1:02:19] take a thought in your mind and listen
[1:02:21] to the message
[1:02:23] I'm talking about the brother runs into
[1:02:24] our message
[1:02:28] does he talk about Sarah
[1:02:30] with a temper
[1:02:37] come on
[1:02:38] did he talk about Sarah and how she run
[1:02:41] around with a neighbor
[1:02:45] or wanted to run around with a neighbor
[1:02:51] oh she would have done that
[1:02:54] well that's wonderful
[1:02:57] but he doesn't spread around doesn't
[1:02:58] speak of her
[1:03:00] Natural Life
[1:03:08] you know he did speak of Moses
[1:03:11] and he said Moses married who was it
[1:03:13] zipporah
[1:03:14] he said she is a hot-headed woman
[1:03:17] and said they had a lot of problems out
[1:03:19] on the backside of the desert
[1:03:21] right
[1:03:25] well now I'm sure you think that
[1:03:28] when Abraham gave Sarah away to Sarah
[1:03:30] they said
[1:03:32] okay honey I do what you tell me to do
[1:03:39] I don't think so now
[1:03:41] I believe she was human she'd say
[1:03:44] Abraham
[1:03:47] what are you doing
[1:03:49] and he said look they're going to kill
[1:03:51] me
[1:03:55] you you get the point
[1:03:57] I'm trying to show you this over here is
[1:04:00] not sin the little things that's when in
[1:04:02] life that happens to us is not sin it's
[1:04:06] sin when you unbelief or doubt now is
[1:04:09] his point right
[1:04:10] he would have flew right sorry right
[1:04:13] then not for arguing with Abraham about
[1:04:15] what he's doing
[1:04:18] he doesn't even mention Sarah arguing
[1:04:21] with him about trying to get the child
[1:04:24] through Hagar
[1:04:29] read it
[1:04:31] what's he talking about
[1:04:33] he would have sluice over right then
[1:04:36] for doubting
[1:04:37] because that's the worst sin there is is
[1:04:40] unbelief
[1:04:41] and the only sin
[1:04:45] and she doubted in life within herself
[1:04:48] when the angel discerned her through the
[1:04:50] den
[1:04:54] trolled and what is it the worst sin
[1:04:56] there is is unbelief
[1:04:59] the only one
[1:05:01] they get all these in your thoughts
[1:05:02] where we'll get to the point look at the
[1:05:04] next one invisible Union number eight
[1:05:07] what is sin sin is unbelief
[1:05:09] unbelief in what
[1:05:14] everyone said eve never doubted God
[1:05:17] being real
[1:05:20] do I need to bring those quotes
[1:05:22] Eve never doubted God
[1:05:27] but she didn't believe him
[1:05:31] that's where she messed up on Hebrews 13
[1:05:33] 8 right she didn't believe him to be who
[1:05:37] he was and what would take place
[1:05:40] so it wasn't beaten on him for a cause
[1:05:42] or something in their lives
[1:05:46] why does preachers want to work on your
[1:05:47] flesh all the time
[1:05:50] instead of getting down where you live
[1:05:52] at
[1:05:54] amen
[1:05:58] is it because that's all they know come
[1:06:00] on
[1:06:03] unbelief in what the word
[1:06:05] unbelief in God
[1:06:07] which is the word
[1:06:13] now
[1:06:15] you've got a problem if you don't follow
[1:06:17] me
[1:06:18] because you've got to get Temperance and
[1:06:20] patience and things in here
[1:06:22] and then that means you got a little
[1:06:24] problems you know with things
[1:06:27] and then you're going to say that a
[1:06:28] Christian has little problems
[1:06:31] and you better agree that he does
[1:06:34] but we better get rid of unbelief
[1:06:37] unbelief is the one thing we better get
[1:06:40] rid of
[1:06:41] all right
[1:06:44] look at number nine which is the events
[1:06:46] made clear by prophecy
[1:06:52] foretelling the future events this
[1:06:53] Believers is commanded by its author to
[1:06:56] read and believe every word of it
[1:06:58] not just part of it
[1:07:00] one word
[1:07:02] to disbelieve it
[1:07:04] you might as well quit trying
[1:07:07] until you believe that word
[1:07:16] are you read
[1:07:18] you might as well quit trying until you
[1:07:20] believe that word well I just won't cry
[1:07:23] anymore because he said it might as well
[1:07:24] not try now don't be stupid
[1:07:31] he simply means back up and start over
[1:07:33] again and try to work right
[1:07:37] well brother Dale I'll have you to know
[1:07:39] I haven't had a wrong thought all week
[1:07:42] we'll praise God pray for me I just had
[1:07:46] one
[1:07:54] I'm trying to get a point to you
[1:07:57] look
[1:07:59] you might as well quit trying until you
[1:08:01] believe that word
[1:08:03] every word is absolutely a part of
[1:08:06] almighty God God made manifest wound
[1:08:10] into his word to show forth who he is we
[1:08:14] are commanded as Believers to believe
[1:08:16] every word of God
[1:08:23] so now what is unbelief
[1:08:29] what does it mean to left side
[1:08:33] all of that unbelief
[1:08:36] and the True Believers in this word roll
[1:08:38] it up
[1:08:42] and the True Believers in this word who
[1:08:44] accept it that way believe it and with
[1:08:46] patience wait for its prophesied
[1:08:48] promises every one of them to be
[1:08:51] manifested in his age every believer has
[1:08:54] watched for it every believer that's
[1:08:56] been on the on the toes watching is the
[1:09:00] one that's been revealed it's been re
[1:09:02] that's been revealed to
[1:09:08] now what has been my point for quite a
[1:09:10] while
[1:09:12] is it revealed to you the age the hour
[1:09:14] that we're living the time
[1:09:19] what about it
[1:09:22] look what he says then on what it takes
[1:09:24] to overcome all unbelief
[1:09:26] our faith that's
[1:09:28] the next one
[1:09:30] number 10.
[1:09:32] and when you see that it ought to
[1:09:33] attract the attention of every man and
[1:09:35] woman to lay aside ever little skeptic
[1:09:37] talk
[1:09:45] every little skeptic talk
[1:09:48] oh I love that
[1:09:50] last I'd ever wait
[1:09:53] and the little unbelief that does so
[1:09:56] easily beset us
[1:09:58] some little something come up and we say
[1:10:01] well
[1:10:02] I never heard that before
[1:10:05] search it out in the scriptures
[1:10:08] if it's the Bible stay with it
[1:10:13] now
[1:10:16] if you've never heard this message
[1:10:20] you never heard the truth of
[1:10:22] water baptism no eternal hell etc etc
[1:10:28] you know you're not an unbeliever
[1:10:32] because you never heard truth
[1:10:35] right
[1:10:37] but when you hear truth and don't
[1:10:39] believe it
[1:10:41] some little simple something well I
[1:10:43] never heard it that way
[1:10:47] brother damn I never heard it explain
[1:10:49] the way you is explaining it this
[1:10:52] morning that we're compassioned about
[1:10:54] was so great a cloud of witnesses that
[1:10:57] everybody behind us is dependent on us
[1:10:59] and everybody after us is dependent on
[1:11:02] us
[1:11:03] I never heard it like that
[1:11:08] but now you have
[1:11:10] what are you gonna do with it
[1:11:13] right
[1:11:14] now it can be determined whether you're
[1:11:17] an unbeliever or not
[1:11:22] you see what I mean and the way the
[1:11:23] preachers are and the way they do things
[1:11:25] and people don't know they say
[1:11:27] I I don't know whether that's true or
[1:11:30] not
[1:11:31] we'll study it out in the Bible
[1:11:35] I'm not going to do that I'm going to go
[1:11:37] back and ask the brother that told me
[1:11:39] that brother Dale was wrong
[1:11:42] we are only going to get more about what
[1:11:44] I'm wrong about why don't you go to the
[1:11:46] Bible and start it out
[1:11:56] all right
[1:11:57] we'll bypass the next one
[1:12:01] no wait a minute
[1:12:02] let's go with this from Hebrews chapter
[1:12:03] 6.
[1:12:05] we will bypass the next one which is
[1:12:06] taken from God's way that's been made
[1:12:09] before us and I quote was quoting this
[1:12:11] morning where brother Brown and said I'm
[1:12:12] not packing up to go to heaven he said
[1:12:14] I'm unpacking to go to heaven there's a
[1:12:17] rapture
[1:12:18] Cut Loose everything the Bible said let
[1:12:21] us lay aside every weight and send that
[1:12:23] does so easily beside us that we might
[1:12:25] run this race with patience
[1:12:30] getting rare things for a rapture
[1:12:34] you just get the statue of perfect man
[1:12:36] it'll take care of the rest of it but
[1:12:39] look at this when this is you know he
[1:12:41] doesn't throw that up there Hebrews
[1:12:42] chapter six let's get that bro back up
[1:12:44] one
[1:12:48] it says God I said give people Faith now
[1:12:51] you see
[1:12:52] and may the little habits and things
[1:12:55] that's hangering hanging unto the people
[1:12:57] you ought to back up to number 10 12.
[1:13:01] back up number 12. we got it okay give
[1:13:04] people faith and may the little habits
[1:13:06] and things that's hanging on two people
[1:13:10] may they Shake loose from them this
[1:13:13] morning with this word of God which is
[1:13:16] an anchor of the Soul steadfast and sure
[1:13:22] is he talking about the little things
[1:13:25] hanging on us of little problems in life
[1:13:27] or is he talking about the little
[1:13:29] unbelief
[1:13:34] when the things are problems of Life a
[1:13:36] thing is covered by The Advocate you
[1:13:38] don't have much trouble but the unbelief
[1:13:42] yeah
[1:13:43] okay think what you want to some of you
[1:13:46] are sitting there brother Dale he's
[1:13:47] trying to make himself something we got
[1:13:49] to believe everything he says
[1:13:53] now you are in on the leaf
[1:13:57] because I have never said that
[1:14:01] so you're in unbelief not me
[1:14:04] I'm just trying to help you
[1:14:09] you see you're making yourself an
[1:14:11] unbeliever
[1:14:13] no I'm not an unbeliever in God I'm an
[1:14:15] unbeliever in you well that's all right
[1:14:18] but if I tell you what he says and you
[1:14:21] don't believe it
[1:14:23] what's the difference
[1:14:26] a dumb donkey telling you the truth and
[1:14:28] you don't believe it you're an
[1:14:30] unbeliever
[1:14:32] you see where we're missing it you see
[1:14:35] what I'm trying to bring down a point to
[1:14:37] what is the worst sin
[1:14:44] that church right over here across the
[1:14:45] road they don't believe in it in one
[1:14:47] true and living God they don't believe
[1:14:49] the truth this message but you know what
[1:14:51] if they've never heard it they're not
[1:14:52] responsible
[1:14:55] right well we've heard it
[1:14:58] so we're responsible
[1:15:00] right
[1:15:04] look at this one on
[1:15:06] melchizer did the great Prince number
[1:15:08] 14.
[1:15:12] separate yourself from everything
[1:15:15] I'll have to say this look I hope it
[1:15:17] finds its resting place
[1:15:21] because I never thought it premeditation
[1:15:23] in other words you never thought it up
[1:15:24] he said I hope you listen maybe that's
[1:15:27] the reason some of us are not getting
[1:15:28] along so well
[1:15:31] we're holding on to things that we ought
[1:15:35] to let go
[1:15:39] separation a little doubt a little
[1:15:41] Wonder a little skeptic
[1:15:43] I wonder if it's right could this be
[1:15:46] could that be how could it be cut loose
[1:15:49] this morning Hebrews 12 1.
[1:15:53] what is that
[1:15:55] unbelief he says
[1:15:58] okay
[1:16:00] let's take this last one then I'll get
[1:16:01] my point
[1:16:02] inspiration preached in 1956.
[1:16:07] paragraph are e62.
[1:16:13] how the Miracles was done by Faith said
[1:16:16] let us let us out ever wait and to sin
[1:16:19] that so easily beset us
[1:16:21] see he's right up there where he's
[1:16:23] talking about it right
[1:16:25] race with patients set before us Hebrews
[1:16:27] 12 sin we're compassionate about with
[1:16:29] such a great crowd of witnesses how the
[1:16:31] Miracles was done by faith
[1:16:33] all the way down before us stands dark
[1:16:35] to guard us and help us to look at what
[1:16:37] happened to the ages what happened in
[1:16:39] the Old Testament about Christ let us
[1:16:42] lay aside every weight and the sin that
[1:16:43] says so easily beset us
[1:16:45] we've stopped too much for little social
[1:16:48] things
[1:16:49] we stop too much intolerant with the
[1:16:53] world
[1:16:54] we've stopped too much to see if we
[1:16:57] don't get a little bit too fanatically
[1:17:02] I'm a scared of
[1:17:04] I'm more afraid listen
[1:17:08] I want you to read that statement
[1:17:11] I am a scared of
[1:17:13] I'm more afraid of the person that's
[1:17:17] afraid
[1:17:21] everybody reading it yes
[1:17:25] yes when I read that the first time I
[1:17:26] passed over it and missed it and I
[1:17:28] looked back at it and I said Lord that's
[1:17:30] the statement I want for the whole
[1:17:31] message
[1:17:33] more afraid of the person that's afraid
[1:17:37] that I am the person that is a fanatic
[1:17:43] now that's a statement isn't it
[1:17:46] remember
[1:17:47] when he said I'd rather have a little
[1:17:49] wildfire and no fire at all
[1:17:51] okay we're down to
[1:17:53] 3 30. give me a few minutes
[1:17:56] what is the worst sin
[1:18:01] we've established that sin is not the
[1:18:03] little things doing wrong and it's not
[1:18:06] even drinking gambling and smoking
[1:18:07] running around with women Etc that if
[1:18:09] you do those things you're just a sinner
[1:18:12] right but in our lives we have little
[1:18:15] problems and things that we have to deal
[1:18:18] with every day and we have an advocate
[1:18:21] and as quick as we do that we repent to
[1:18:23] get rid of it and ask God to help us
[1:18:28] yeah
[1:18:30] but we found out sin is unbelief
[1:18:37] sin is to
[1:18:39] be as we read
[1:18:41] well I never thought of it like that
[1:18:47] what he said but I never thought of it
[1:18:49] like that
[1:18:51] so by me never thinking of it like that
[1:18:52] I don't agree with you because it would
[1:18:55] have come to anybody would have come to
[1:18:56] me
[1:18:57] you're in unbelief
[1:19:03] right
[1:19:06] what is the worst sin now of all
[1:19:14] and I'm going to make it personal all
[1:19:16] right
[1:19:18] go ahead
[1:19:20] and we'll make it very personal
[1:19:24] for 40 something years
[1:19:27] I have tried
[1:19:28] to get you to see
[1:19:30] this message
[1:19:32] of what I believed it was
[1:19:36] that it was to bring forth Christ
[1:19:38] in the last days
[1:19:41] and that Christ Among Us
[1:19:44] would change these mortal bodies and
[1:19:46] take us into Rapture that's all I've
[1:19:49] done
[1:19:50] 1969 in Athens Georgia I preached that
[1:19:53] the Bride of Jesus Christ would be the
[1:19:56] son of man
[1:19:58] the word made flesh
[1:20:01] how much do you think I believe that
[1:20:03] today
[1:20:04] I have preached to you from my heart
[1:20:08] for all of these years
[1:20:11] fault of battles and the Skeptics here
[1:20:14] and the doubters and the the
[1:20:16] people trying to destroy it
[1:20:20] yet still loving and
[1:20:24] wanting to move on because I know
[1:20:26] that if you don't see what I'm talking
[1:20:28] about
[1:20:31] I can't make you see it
[1:20:35] know that
[1:20:38] if God revealed it to me
[1:20:43] I can try to help you to see it
[1:20:47] but I can't give it to you
[1:20:51] it's between you and God
[1:20:54] so I want to know whether I've missed a
[1:20:56] message out
[1:20:59] now don't come with me that I call Mary
[1:21:01] Martin Martha Mary don't be
[1:21:04] please don't be dumb
[1:21:09] I want to know where I've missed the
[1:21:11] message anymore
[1:21:15] from the seals
[1:21:18] to the marriage and divorce
[1:21:20] the Daniel 70 weeks
[1:21:24] to the predestination
[1:21:29] I want to know where I missed the
[1:21:30] message
[1:21:31] because if I missed it
[1:21:34] there's where my sin lies
[1:21:38] I need to get that
[1:21:39] in line
[1:21:42] because sin is to disbelieve the message
[1:21:47] now follow me we're not concerned with
[1:21:50] disbelieving or we shouldn't be worried
[1:21:53] about disbelieving Luther's message we
[1:21:55] know we don't believe what he taught was
[1:21:57] wrong but we do believe what he taught
[1:21:59] right as to be right
[1:22:03] all right
[1:22:04] so the main thing is over in you here
[1:22:07] so what is the greatest sin brother Dale
[1:22:10] that you could think of
[1:22:14] I spent 29 messages 28.
[1:22:17] speaking on positive attitude
[1:22:21] I believe we all need a positive
[1:22:23] attitude
[1:22:25] I believe we need to get away from
[1:22:27] negativism
[1:22:29] of doubts and frustrations of whether or
[1:22:32] not we're believing the truth
[1:22:35] thing as the Bible called it wandering
[1:22:37] Stars
[1:22:39] wondering if this one's right or if that
[1:22:42] one's right or if this is right or
[1:22:43] that's right and get settled down into a
[1:22:45] point
[1:22:48] of saying the message is right
[1:22:54] all right
[1:22:57] what has been my point
[1:23:01] 28 messages driving at this message
[1:23:04] 29 really counting this morning I guess
[1:23:06] 28.
[1:23:11] for you to disbelieve
[1:23:15] the truth that I've brought
[1:23:18] about what we're supposed to be in the
[1:23:20] end time
[1:23:22] we are supposed to be the bride of
[1:23:24] Christ we are supposed to be an
[1:23:26] invincible Army
[1:23:27] we're supposed to be a people who walks
[1:23:30] in the light of the love of God in the
[1:23:32] word we're supposed to be them that are
[1:23:35] word born bride
[1:23:36] the son of man that even God is not
[1:23:39] complete without us the prophet would
[1:23:41] reign
[1:23:43] and for you to disbelieve that as being
[1:23:45] you
[1:23:51] and that's sin
[1:23:53] what do you mean brother Dale
[1:23:56] I mean for you to say
[1:23:58] I just can't believe it that away
[1:24:01] well I want to know where the truth is
[1:24:03] so come and tell me
[1:24:04] and your duty bound to tell me not tell
[1:24:06] nobody else if you tell anybody else
[1:24:08] you're a lying hypocrite
[1:24:10] gonna make it any worse you're a stupid
[1:24:12] idiot
[1:24:14] you're a dumb nut can I call you
[1:24:17] anything else
[1:24:18] I've always said if you got something
[1:24:20] with me come to me
[1:24:23] and let's talk it over but no it's
[1:24:26] outside
[1:24:32] you will answer for that
[1:24:35] right because I have given even the
[1:24:38] pulpit
[1:24:39] to be opened
[1:24:42] for you to come and show me where I'm
[1:24:44] wrong
[1:24:48] see I'm not saying you got to believe
[1:24:50] what brother Dale believes
[1:24:52] I believe I have put forth
[1:24:54] in this study the things of the great
[1:24:58] faith
[1:25:00] that God expects you and I to have
[1:25:03] to be able to walk off this Earth
[1:25:07] and to have one little bit of unbelief
[1:25:09] in there or to doubt it being us
[1:25:13] is sin
[1:25:16] you say well I I I I just can't believe
[1:25:20] that it's for me
[1:25:22] then you're a sinner
[1:25:26] because you're saying God's not able to
[1:25:28] make it for you
[1:25:31] I know that ain't gonna go over because
[1:25:33] you're
[1:25:37] I'll stay with it
[1:25:41] sin is unbelief
[1:25:44] I preach things that most of the
[1:25:45] Ministers of this message have never and
[1:25:48] will never even try to preach about
[1:25:54] that doesn't exalt me
[1:25:56] I give all the honor and glory to the
[1:25:59] Lord Jesus Christ because he's the only
[1:26:03] one that can keep me straight and I walk
[1:26:06] out here sometimes with notes and I'm
[1:26:08] lined up a certain way and I something
[1:26:11] happens and he comes down and those
[1:26:13] notes are totally
[1:26:14] totally destroyed
[1:26:17] because he showed me what truth is
[1:26:24] it's not whether you believe me or not
[1:26:27] brother Branham said we I've read the
[1:26:29] quote need to read it again we've been
[1:26:31] Invincible Army
[1:26:33] Satan would be powerless before us
[1:26:36] he said it
[1:26:38] do you believe
[1:26:39] that can ever take place
[1:26:46] do you I'm asking do you believe that
[1:26:48] can ever
[1:26:51] well
[1:26:53] I wouldn't want to said it
[1:26:56] I just keep holding it up
[1:27:02] I keep saying we're responsible
[1:27:07] we're responsible to believe how the
[1:27:10] word of God
[1:27:11] he said what is unbelief unbelief in God
[1:27:14] who is the word
[1:27:19] but I just don't see how it can be us
[1:27:23] you're an unbelief
[1:27:31] can I put it any planner you're an
[1:27:33] unbelief
[1:27:35] if you don't believe you can be a part
[1:27:37] of it then you're an unbelief
[1:27:39] I believe brother so and so can I
[1:27:41] believe sister so and so brother random
[1:27:43] didn't say that brother Brown said if
[1:27:46] there's one going out of the state
[1:27:49] you've got to say and believe that you
[1:27:52] are that one
[1:27:55] but I don't understand all of these
[1:27:57] great Mysteries nobody has said anything
[1:27:59] about it
[1:28:02] see that's what you think it is you
[1:28:04] think it's understanding all of these
[1:28:06] things it is not it is that Revelation
[1:28:09] coming in within us that is pushing out
[1:28:11] of Christ to live in our hearts and our
[1:28:14] lives baby
[1:28:15] well the Bible's not a book of rules
[1:28:20] it's a revelation of Jesus Christ and
[1:28:22] then Paul said I Die daily
[1:28:25] that was him writing about Christ in him
[1:28:30] the life that I now live in the flesh I
[1:28:33] live by the faith of the Son of God he
[1:28:35] was saying what God was inside of him
[1:28:45] what you say one brother but you just
[1:28:47] don't preach against women hiring
[1:28:49] dresses
[1:28:54] that's what we don't like about you
[1:28:56] well why don't you dress right
[1:28:59] why don't you quit cutting your hair and
[1:29:00] I don't have to preach it
[1:29:07] right man come here one time
[1:29:10] he preached the messages preached freed
[1:29:12] my sheep
[1:29:15] he went on for an hour and a half and I
[1:29:16] knew he was saying something but I
[1:29:18] couldn't figure it out
[1:29:22] about three years later or four
[1:29:25] he said you remember that life message I
[1:29:29] preached at your church
[1:29:32] but yeah it was like feed my sheep
[1:29:37] that's what I was trying to tell you
[1:29:39] that you're so deep
[1:29:42] since my family was going to your church
[1:29:45] I said you ought to drop back and feed
[1:29:47] my family instead of all them deep
[1:29:49] things
[1:29:56] you think I'm a dirty dog
[1:30:00] I turned and walked away from that
[1:30:01] person because within my heart
[1:30:04] I was thinking why didn't you teach your
[1:30:07] children
[1:30:07] the right things to do in life and I
[1:30:12] wouldn't have had to worry about them
[1:30:13] here
[1:30:16] and I could preach what God gave me
[1:30:24] you see you think we need to preach
[1:30:26] simple things
[1:30:28] what's more simple than faith
[1:30:31] what's more simple than believe in God
[1:30:36] what's more more simple than getting you
[1:30:39] to realize who you are
[1:30:43] you show me the Simplicity oh no you
[1:30:46] preaching his iron Dress You Preach
[1:30:47] against 100. I ask you I've made this
[1:30:50] statement and I'll make it one more time
[1:30:52] you show me a church where there's a
[1:30:54] legalistic preacher of those tiles and
[1:30:56] I'll put the women in this church
[1:30:57] against them as being dressed better
[1:31:01] and doing better
[1:31:06] I've never seen a church yet and you
[1:31:08] ain't either
[1:31:10] if you'll think that they had a
[1:31:12] legalistic preacher that the women ever
[1:31:14] lined up
[1:31:17] thank God
[1:31:20] sit in a man's house one time legalistic
[1:31:23] preacher he said brother Dale said what
[1:31:25] is it that that the women could wire
[1:31:27] where we could go in mixed bathing
[1:31:32] I have to admit I had problems
[1:31:37] because he was legalistic to the Core
[1:31:40] I said brother
[1:31:42] I said brother Branham said mixed
[1:31:44] bathing was wrong
[1:31:47] oh he did
[1:31:55] and he used to scream and holler about
[1:31:57] the can't dress
[1:32:01] these women wearing these tent dresses
[1:32:03] every service
[1:32:05] and one day I'm stupid I don't
[1:32:06] understand all that stuff what clothes
[1:32:08] are you know
[1:32:12] and I asked my wife I said what is a
[1:32:14] tent dress
[1:32:16] he said well they kind of pull up here
[1:32:18] and I know I'll be wrong with it but
[1:32:20] kind of flared out it's kind of pulled
[1:32:22] up here
[1:32:23] and and fastens around and it's called a
[1:32:25] tent style dress they can explain the
[1:32:27] rest of you I said honey would you show
[1:32:29] me one of them
[1:32:33] she said them sisters right over there
[1:32:39] all the sisters was right over there was
[1:32:41] the sisters that come from his church
[1:32:48] what did they do with his dress isn't
[1:32:50] home
[1:32:54] and they said we wear Gauchos to ride
[1:32:56] horses
[1:32:59] not much difference between gotchos and
[1:33:02] pants
[1:33:03] but of course I'm not that spiritual you
[1:33:05] know
[1:33:10] you see Church
[1:33:12] I'm dealing Within Myself of one thing
[1:33:16] I won't ever dab of unbelief with this
[1:33:19] message this Bible
[1:33:21] and things that I could look at in there
[1:33:23] and say I don't know whether that can be
[1:33:24] or not I want that took out I want that
[1:33:28] took out of my heart and my life
[1:33:30] they were when the prophet says the
[1:33:32] bride will be the fullness of the
[1:33:33] godhead bodily I can holler amen
[1:33:37] make me Lord what you want me to be
[1:33:42] show me where I'm wrong
[1:33:45] unbelief
[1:33:48] in God's word that is God
[1:33:53] let's Stand Together come on musician
[1:33:55] think on these things
[1:33:58] what is unbelief
[1:34:01] well brother Dale I admit I don't even
[1:34:03] know what you're talking about
[1:34:05] the tapes are made you can go home
[1:34:07] listen to them again if you don't I'll
[1:34:09] be sitting in an office or somewhere
[1:34:10] around
[1:34:12] give me a chance to do it I've always
[1:34:13] said
[1:34:16] I told him about it in a Bible study I
[1:34:18] mentioned it the other day when I go
[1:34:20] outside I try my best to shake ends with
[1:34:22] everybody here
[1:34:23] I think that's a good pastor
[1:34:26] I don't stop with the first person and
[1:34:29] let them Captivate my conversation and
[1:34:32] my hours
[1:34:35] I go and I talk to everybody then if you
[1:34:37] want to talk to me I'll be glad to talk
[1:34:39] to you
[1:34:41] but give me an opportunity to go shake
[1:34:42] hands with everybody
[1:34:45] how many of you shook hands with the
[1:34:47] visitors this morning
[1:34:51] got a few hands
[1:34:55] a lot of you didn't shake hands with the
[1:34:57] visitors did you
[1:34:59] well why do you feel if you went to
[1:35:00] their Church and they didn't shake your
[1:35:03] hand you would come back saying they
[1:35:05] didn't shake my hand
[1:35:09] remember
[1:35:11] to have friends
[1:35:13] you must be friendly
[1:35:17] right
[1:35:20] make people welcome
[1:35:23] yeah I don't want to welcome because
[1:35:25] they're not a part of us well good why
[1:35:26] don't you leave because you ain't a part
[1:35:28] of us
[1:35:33] can I get any more blood
[1:35:37] but you see I always get into trouble
[1:35:39] because everybody tries to interpret
[1:35:41] what I'm saying instead of saying what I
[1:35:44] say
[1:35:48] you say what I say I ain't got a bit of
[1:35:49] trouble you coming back with me and
[1:35:51] talking to me about it
[1:35:54] but when you say what you think
[1:35:58] that I supposed to think
[1:36:01] I don't think that way
[1:36:06] don't ask me if you don't want the truth
[1:36:10] because if you ask me I'll tell you
[1:36:12] where I stand
[1:36:14] but it'll be in the Love From the Bottom
[1:36:16] of My Heart
[1:36:20] and with a realization that you're
[1:36:22] looking in the face of a sinner
[1:36:26] I said it right you're looking in the
[1:36:28] face of a sinner
[1:36:31] I don't know any word that I disbelieve
[1:36:33] right around this message
[1:36:35] you understand how I could spend hours
[1:36:37] on do you believe any do you disbelieve
[1:36:39] any part of the message no
[1:36:42] I'm just asking you something do you
[1:36:44] disbelieve any part of it no we say no I
[1:36:46] believe
[1:36:48] if it's never been brought out in the
[1:36:50] open you don't know what you're
[1:36:51] believing
[1:36:56] see you could have come from a two soul
[1:36:58] group of people to say I believe
[1:36:59] everything brother Brown says
[1:37:03] right
[1:37:06] take on these things go ahead brother
[1:37:08] 403 in the spiral book I've Been Changed
