TRANSCRIPT
========================================
we're shining in the light of [Music] to power in love as we sing holy go so high and lived it oh you're shining in the light of your glory pour out your power as we see [Music] Oh [Music] Oh and I want to see amen ma I think we ought to just go home I don't mean to our homes I mean to our home beyond the sky me man I'm looking forward to it I'm looking forward to being with you all over there well we can't get there until we get it together over here and that's what we're endeavoring to do tonight to finish off the old year and enter into the new brother Samuel and I were talking before service and we were talking about when that last one comes in you realize that you could be here tonight you could already have given your heart to the Lord and if you haven't don't hesitate get it right but maybe God's just waiting for me or you to get to the stage of maturity where we have rapturing faith and I'll tell you what the saints that have gone on before us waiting on us shouting for him pulling on us because they realize that the resurrection lays within God's Word which lays within you and I so that resurrection is in us tonight you love him praise the Lord I don't need to introduce myself except maybe to those online my name's brother Chris long I am a friend and a part of your family and it's a pleasure it's a pleasure to be that I'll tell you that right now amen so could we just get right into it I see brother Samuel got me out here a little early so maybe I could go a little longer but anything I'm working on it you know the first time I preached somewhere this brother said brother you got a problem and I said what - help me brother what is it he said you preach too short he said where he come from it was 2 3 hours and they was just getting started well I said well I could probably do it but I hate to where everybody out I'd like to say just 5 words with understanding instead of 10,000 words without hey man so let's just open our Bibles I gave the brothers a title to the message it may seem like an odd title at first but I'm gonna come around to it if it's alright alright so let's go to Genesis 1:26 probably a portion of it's probably the my favorite portion of scripture in Genesis because it pertains to you and me and there's a purpose behind it so let's start with that when you got it say Amen man I buy I brought a prop out you might think it's a seed took it out of an avocado I hate to have a kado but it's a seal I'll get to that in just a bit alright here we go and God said I like it already let us make man in our image after our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea over the fowl of the air and over the cattle and over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth so God created man in his own image we know that's a spirit man in the image of God created he him male and female created he them but we're not done there's a purpose behind and God said and that purpose is so that what he said could bring forth after its kind so he had to insert verse 28 and God blessed them who I like and God said unto them be fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth and subdue it and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth let's pray father Lord Jesus were just here father 2:2 be able to be used by you to further your children into the kingdom Lord I want to go with them though tonight father so as I'm preaching to them you let me preach to myself Lord as if I was part of them and they were part of me and we're all part of you we love you we thank you Lord we'll be careful to always give you the praise the honor and the glory Lord if there be any sick amongst us father let the Holy Spirit right now father anoint their bodies and raise them up father and give them the unction to receive from you use my lips remove me father and use me anoint the ears of the hearers let the Holy Spirit be our filter in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen god bless you may be seated now I have taken several different approaches to this my wife's heard it four or five times but it's never the same God's Word has no beginning it'll never have an end so I say this to you as as some a friendly advice quit trying to figure it out we're a creature here on earth that as far as we know we had a beginning but the Word of God has begun to inform those of us who were in him before the foundation of the world that we had no beginning now it's tough it's hard because we see the calendar and the clock and and the days and the seasons and the years go by and and we're up and we're down and we're in and we're out well there was a purpose behind that the purpose behind that was so God could express his attributes did you realize that he wanted to express his attributes now it's interesting because you and I may be in our mental capacity no matter how mentally prowess we are and educated and smart how much we know science and math and and trigonometry and geometry and calculus and and all those things that that science bases their their their mindset on brothers and sisters we never going to figure God out what we need to do is get in fasten our seatbelts and go for a ride just don't get out and we're gonna find out I pray that the Lord will help me bring to you the way this has come about and because God is positive because his life because he's happiness he's joy because he's health because he's all the things that we perceive as good it's pretty hard for us to think about how that this plan that were now flowing through in the stream of life could possibly have come from god but God because he is those things had to permit a weakness he had to pre didn't he's not weak he had to permit a weakness he had to make things in such a way where there could be the possibility if all of the things fell into place which God is not like you and me he's not figuring this out as he goes okay but he's allowing you and me to figure it out as we go because he needs he wants he desires to express his attributes now I know this is this is me I want you to understand the way God uses me in me and me and and has me thinking about meditating on his word and so forth and and and to help you understand how I arrived at what I've got here in my notebook and what I'm gonna preach to you tonight it's it's like this for me then I emphasize that because it's not a doctrine all right it's me entering in to the meditation of God's Word and message and and okay lord help me here I would like to better understand this so is there something I'm a pretty simple guy I'm not highly educated I like to read and and study different things but you know I just barely got through school and sports was the thing that took me through it because I was bored I wasn't saved oh if I were saved when I was in school whoo but God had a plan I'm satisfied with that I'm very satisfied with he knew what he was doing all the time I've come to that conclusion but but God before the foundation of the world in his mind now now I think everybody in here has a mind and if you're not asleep you're probably thinking now you might be thinking what's he going to say you might be thinking hold on for you young people might be thinking about man I'd like to go home and mess around with my stuff give me my cell phone you know there's you don't realize it may be brothers and sisters but it's a reason for all this it's called distraction Satan he has a purpose now we realized that God has not got Satan on a bunch of strings holding him like a puppet because God has foreknowledge now we realize that prophecy prophecy is not God manipulating I want to make that I wanted to get that in prophecy is not God manipulating anything it's God giving you and I our choice as human beings and you and I making choices as human beings and God saying if you choose this this is what's gonna happen if you choose this this is what's gonna happen cuz he's made his free moral agents now that's pretty controversial I won't go into that tonight that'll take weeks months and years because it's by revelation a lot of people think predestination is God's got it all down there for me in the script all's I gotta do is remember the script you know don't forget my lines and Sam I don't I'm show some emotional expression or not and I'm in I'm gonna tell you what kind of God we serve he gave you the choice he gave me the choice I know it's hard to comprehend because we think well God's in control yes he's in control but he's the kind of God that when he makes something he knows what it's gonna do and how it's gonna think cuz think about it who made Satan where'd he come from see God brought him into existence and God said what would you like to do well I'd like to be God he said I'll tell you what he said I'll let you be everything I am except the Creator okay but that's just nod that's just ate at Satan's conscience well I said I wanted to be like God now he's gonna let me go 99.9 percent of the way and then not let me be God there's a reason for that yeah there's only one God there's not two or three or five or ten but you see God allowed Lucifer Satan to be elevated to such a high office that he became if you study your message in the message marriage and divorce he became God's right-hand man now a lot of people say well Satan's not a man we'll have you read your Bible I can take you into his ego to say is this the guy you mean this is the man that buffaloed all of us for all this time and mocking him but see God had a plan and God's plan allowed a weakness but I want you to see how this weakness operates before I go forward because God has has stated in the Bible God said let us make man now when he made that statement Lucifer was like I see my way in I see how I can be like God as a matter of fact the book of Thessalonians which you're gonna read out of pretty quickly says he thinks he's God because he saw while he was a covering cherub did you realize that in the type of the Ark of the Covenant that Lucifer was the right hand cherub and while he was saying holy holy holy under the Lord God Almighty he was studying God's Word oh let us make man he's going to open himself up Satan thinks for his children he said I see it I see how now I can enter in I can't be God I can't make myself God but if I could become a child of God he has no choice because then I would be his offspring think about it and his plan mandates three offices Father Son and Holy Ghost that's the office that Satan failed to implement into his plan in the beginning he said if I can become a son of God I can be like God but God said you can knock on that door you can enter in there but I got another of us and that's the office that I'm going to deal with mankind through and that's the Holy Spirit that's why it's so important to you are to you and I but after Satan began to study God's Word I mean he is the ultimate scientist he's the ultimate mathematician he's the ultimate now he's not God but I want you to remember something about these words that I'm using like education and academia and mathematics and science and so forth we realized that those things aren't bad unless you try to use them against the Word of God God is the supreme mathematician but remember something you cannot figure out God by mathematics you know I don't watch television like you think but I'll I'll find a documentary and and get it and put it in there and watch it and I and I and I happen to do a little bit of a research not making me smarter just interested in why brother Branham mentioned Einstein I mean brother Brandon went so far as to say if Einstein had a spiritual I'll say it like this new birth justification sanctification baptism Holy Ghost and if it was the seed of God in the beginning he could have brought worlds into existence what a mathematician and then I see these New Age fellows coming up this Tyson de Grasse saying Einstein he was nothing but just a elementary math student shame on that man because he was the foundation of what this man's building on now I'm not against him I want you understand I just want you to see where I'm going God has no beginning how far can you go back God will have no end how far can you go forward see we have to we have to become we have to come to the understanding that you and I brothers and sisters you young people in here brothers and sisters old people doesn't matter we had no beginning and I know how automatically it's like come on stop trying to figure it out you'll never get anywhere I mean you'll get pages and pages of notes you'll have a massive brain but you'll be no closer to God because God put something into operation that is so simple that it's missed by the wise and the prudent it's called faith what is faith what if you look it up in the dictionary it reads like this paraphrasing it but you look it up something in which you believe it has no proof come on that doesn't even I mean come on brother prove it to me well let me sit let me go on now so before the foundation in the world in the mind of God God had attributes he wanted to express now his attribute are called his children is that right but we're also finding out that his attributes consist of healer is that one of his children watch now provider is that one of his children is that one of his attributes Savior but nothing was lost nothing had a need nothing was sick you with me now we're gonna have to journey by faith oh yeah we've got to lay the textbooks aside and now we got a journey about nothing was sick nothing was lost nothing had a need and on and on and on and so forth so so how did this all come about if you and I or I shouldn't even say if because you and I are his children his attributes how did we get sick how come we have needs why are we lost well the truth in the matter is we're not sick we're not lost I'll get there I know it's like huh why am I in this condition yeah because you're one of his attributes and what you desired in the mind of God was to be able to be used by your father God to fulfill his attributes so I say it like this brother say know not to throw you off but I say it like this because I'm gonna venture by faith right now and I'm gonna say would you say father well I have an attribute existing in me and it's just bubbling around in there and it is to be a savior hmm nothing's lost well I'll have to go to the dictionary dad and look that up look up the word Savior the word Savior requires something lost something not saved something unsaved so perhaps I'll use myself an example I think you could put yourself in here without any foreknowledge I say alright daddy you need to be a savior I need to be lost you want to be here I'll go I'll be sick all the time not realizing that we're fulfilling the plan of God can you imagine Lucifer he's going yeah I'll make him sick I'll figure out how to lose them that's right that's right I'll show them what it means to have a need and God's not like oh you know when God says anything he puts faith in his own word and it comes to pass so brothers sisters here you and are tonight New Year's Eve 2019 going into 2020 I got saved in 1978 of August and I never thought I'd see the Christmas of 1978 I really believed that the rapture was going to take place the next day I want you to understand me I've never stopped believing I believe that we're in the rapture and because we can't figure God out mathematically we don't have to put a date on it you could but we don't have to why because we're sitting in heavenly places in Christ Jesus and time doesn't matter anymore can we get there that's where I want to go I want to become the fulfillment of revelations 10 and time shall be no more oh the clocks gonna still tick if I take it back into Genesis 1 and read to you the very first sentence and in the beginning that's time but that's time without a clock and then God began to bring his creation through the spoken word in the manifestation now we realize that the Prophet taught us it could have been millions and millions and trillions of years but if you're not a creature of time a day is a thousand years and a thousand years is a day I mean what's what's the big deal he's not growing old huh in the beginning time seven days in the book of Genesis it looks like time but you and I begin to become involved in the message of the hour which is what it is and we see that God informed a prophet that Adam and Eve did not live under the clock and calendar but there were nights and days until the fall now we got a problem because now we're growing older by the day and you young folks I'm gonna give you a fair warning I was young once I thought I was invincible but I'm paying for it dearly tonight my back hurts my shoulders hurt my arm hurts mine I got an artificial titanium knee it doesn't hurt but everything around it does I'm losing my hair faster than I can shampoo and comb it my face is sagging I'm getting old praise the Lord because he also said in order for me to carry out my plan I'm gonna need somebody to step into the element of time and calendar and clock that begin to decay but because we're attributes of his because we were in his mind before the foundation of the world there's something that tells us it's okay now I could bring out the word theophany but that's a whole different set of messages I want to try to get us around to where we're at tonight December the 31st 2019 now you all realize that over there in the east they've already been shot it's already the new year over there but for us it's tonight you're still with me I'm gonna get the second Thessalonians in a minute but let me cover a couple things cuz I got time let us make man he says well can I ask y'all a question who's us there's only one God hey there's not - let us make man so I said well I understand but I want to break it down Lord for your people so I looked up the word us seems simple enough well the dictionary says this plural who more than one now there's only one God so God has allowed somebody to enter his arena you understand what I'm saying to come into his classroom and work so close to his side that he could say hey let us make man the word us is plural it's used to refer to the speaker and another person or group I want you to get this God isn't asking you and I to become his partner he's already made us his partner right ear he said and God said let us you see brothers and sisters it's used to refer to the speaker that's God because it says and God said and another person or group of people I wrote down brother Samuel 1st Corinthians 12:12 through 20 a mystical body one body many members can I ask you a personal question tonight who wants to be in that number you're choosing right now if you haven't chosen already you're choosing right now and if you don't raise your hand it's okay with me but you've made the wrong choice I'm preaching to you this way so that you'll see there is a choice you can make it it'll change your life and you can become an elite member of us let us make man use the refer to the speaker and another person or group of people as the indirect object or direct object oh I like this look cuz I can understand it of a verb even you school children know what a verb is but if you don't all read it to you it's used to express action oh currents and mode of being oh when I saw that brother Sam I said that's it God has given you an R in the choice how by just entering in by faith to become part of us now let me let me let me I'm gonna just pull off right there I'm gonna go back to it but I want you to see how this works brothers in the back I'm sorry that I didn't give you this page number but I gave him this one Genesis 1 3 through 5 we all know in the Bible that God said let there be light is that right shall we hey if you got nothing don't fall asleep on me now they put it up there for you Genesis 1:3 and God said now I want everybody to understand something as I move forward the first thing that came into existence was not light it was sound and God said let there be light and the Bible says and there was light and God saw a lot that it was good and God had divided the light from the darkness and God called the light day in the darkness he called night and the evening in the morning were the first day now I'm going to refer to something the brother Bram said in the message God's Word calls for a total separation 121 or 64 he says God was going to use the earth you believe that listen careful now and it was in darkness God was going to use the earth and it was in darkness for the first 21 years and eight months of my life I was a piece of dirt that was in darkness he said God was going to use the earth and it was in total darkness the Spirit of God spoke out and said let there be light now well I was the earth he was going to use in total darkness as you were also we didn't have any concept of God said let there be light but he said it for a reason here's why he said you and I think oh he said it so that we could have the warm sun shine that is not the reason he said it he said it for this reason and he separated the light from the darkness and it's been doing that ever since separating his life from dargah primes the Lord so what he said let there be light and you began to receive it it began to separate the darkness from your life and bring light into you in other words he began to enlighten you so that you could become conscious and aware that he was doing it beautiful so what's this in the spoken word is the original seed at the bottom of page 70 in this particular publication yeah I know I got notes all over it but that's okay and the pages are falling out but that's okay at the bottom of page 70 it says now the bride of Adam was a type of the second Adams bride now Adams bride Adams bride could not wait we're pretty anxious folks around here God had told Adam and Eve now remember something brothers and sisters God knew it was going to be Adam and Eve but the Bible doesn't say Adam and Eve it says let us make man God had told Adam and Eve through Genesis 1:26 and 27 and 8 multiply and replace the earth now remember something when God made this statement in Genesis 1:28 he was talking to Spirit you see what brought me to this point brothers and sisters is we're not fighting flesh and blood stop it I'm telling myself - I'm preaching to myself brother stop it we're not fighting flesh and blood we're not fighting our parents or our children or our grandparents or our grandchildren we're not fighting our co-workers we're not fighting our pastor brothers and sisters in church we're not fighting all the people around the world that have opposing doctrines or the right doctors we're not fighting them right now we're fighting the Prince of the power of the air and I want you to understand tonight brothers and sense if I don't get anything else to you how this is working we are fighting him through the statement let us make man see because when he said let there be light then God said let us make man guess what it's been an on coming thing excuse me brother that's what brother Branham says in spoken word is the original see right here he says multiply and replace theirs it was an oncoming thing promise did you realize that did you realize when you read Genesis 1:26 seven and eight it's an oncoming thing it's a promise now remember something brothers and sisters God's not in a hurry we are and we gotta be careful because he got in hurry she knew what God said even even even even even the serpent man who's being used by the devil said hath God not set but he slipped one in there didn't he you know the word Satan means adversary comes from the word add verse now in the book of revelations chapter 22 it says do not add to or take away from is that right but if the plagues will be added to you and your name will be taken out of the book correct guess what guess how smart Satan is in one fell swoop using one word he not only added to the verse took away from it because he used a negative not he added one negative to God's Word and he not only added to by using it but they tucked away by using it that's how sharp it is brothers and sisters just put the wrong word in the wrong place and not only could you be adding to but you could be taking away from that's why the prophet of God warned us and warned us and warned to stay with the word now I want you to understand something when I say that phrase it doesn't necessarily mean stay with the letter because the letter killeth how come how are we to stay with the word and then the letter killeth because we will apply our intellectual conception to the letter but when it's the word it's made flesh that's John 1 verse 1 and verse 14 in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God I find it interesting that in John 1 he used was of course he always is but so that you and I can see how God's plan was conned and sending down in the beginning God was but now in verse 14 he's made flesh and dwelt among us did you realize he's in the building tonight because wherever two or three are gathered in my name and I know at least two or three of us were gathered in his name and if everybody left and there was only one believer left he could still gather in two or three because he's body spirit and soul now this sinful flesh needs some work but if you're born again of the Word of God and then the spirit of that word rises up and baptizes you there's at least two of you there's at least two of you in the congregation so brothers and sisters do you see that this was an oncoming thing a promise she was watching he says she was not his wife as yet because he had never lived with her the Bride of Christ is not his wife yet he says the wedding supper is to take place now I'll be very careful but I'll make sure that all of the adults and those mature younger people that are in here the reason why he used the phrase wife and not bride is because they had not consummated the relationship but she was his bride even with me all right let me move on put that over there praise the Lord okay so we realize that us let us make man used to refer to the speaker and another person or group of people as the indirect object or direct object of a verb well then it's quite plain to me brother Wade that what Adam what the spirit man was being intended to be used for was to become a noun a verb is of no use without her now and what is it not a person place or thing let us make man in our image so God is beginning to implement an institute his plan but remember something it's by faith we aren't gonna be able to go through the Bible and the message and chart it all down and say that's it I do this one more thing let me just add it just another ingredient I was telling my wife like this the Bible I've already said this job but I'm going to take it to another direction now this is the blueprint but in this analogy this represents the ingredients of the let's make a cake not so you can understand let's let's make a cake so what do we need to make a cake ingredients now once we've collected all the ingredients together there can be some ugly cakes coming out of here they can be 969 different cakes coming out of that same book denominations are called because without the recipe who knows what it's gonna come out like mostly wrong so the message of the hour is the recipe it tells us how much it tells us how to set the temperature and the preheat it tells us it tells us everything we need to know about the ingredients but guess what brothers and sisters we still need a verb somebody has gotta pick up the ingredients somebody has gotta look at the recipe and begin to employ begin to act begin to use those things that are at their disposal to do the work that's called for right now we're going to make a cake so I can tell you how this is working so throughout the history of the book of ingredients there have been all kinds of Baker's but we realize since the beginning of time Abraham had it right Isaac Jacob that became Israel so you see God knows how to take an ingredient and turn water into wine oh I don't have any of that on the Shelf you can fix that we don't have any wine here bring your water I'll change it oh I'll take the book and I'll show you how it's done but we still gotta bake the cake we still had we still got to mix it we got to put it in the bowl we got to put it together now how are we doing this my faith and we put it in the oven and we did it all done now brothers and sisters if you can stay with me this is where the Prophet came in I'm gonna tell you what the way that God deals with me that's all not a doctor but God decided it was time to bring the cake out of the oven and a prophet rises up God washed over him God kept him God protected him God made sure he didn't drink or smoke weed a file his body in any way do you and I have that privilege know how important does that make us huh you see in the Book of Daniel Daniel had an angel coming down and directing him and speaking to him and talking to him and showing him all the things and don't do this and do this and read this and don't read this and don't go there's kind of like the angels coming down to visit brother Branham he had it all right now nope nope nope nope let's scratch that out that's not the way it is here change this to over here this is the way I want you to say it write it down this way praise the Lord do you believe that all but meshach Shadrach and Abednego biddin ago did not have the angel of the Lord coming down and directing and redirecting they only had the word of Daniel see where we're at we don't have the angel the Lord coming down regularly saying oh don't turn left up don't turn right up go straight go back up and even if we did as I said the other day cuz I let's be honest is there anybody in the room or in the internet audience that would not like to have a visitation from the angel of the Lord I prayed for it I'll be honest with you so far he hasn't come the way he came to the Prophet but he came to the prophet and he told the Prophet to tell me and yo y'all got a theophany yeah okay but you're walking by faith why there's a place in the message where brother Branham said if this all in my ministry had to take place under my personal faith forget about it okay and he had great faith but what his faith and his confidence was resting in is that the angel of the Lord came down never lied to him so he began to increasingly lean on well you know I'm waiting for somebody I'd like to get this thing started but I'm waiting for somebody I want everybody in the room to understand that while brother Branham in himself was saying that waiting for the angel the Lord I want you to understand that the Almighty God is waiting for somebody let us we know he can do it he wants you and I to see if we can do it and that makes us his children you see when God sent Abraham up on the mountain with Isaac come on this is the omniscient omnipotent omnipresent God he knew that Abraham was gonna by his foreknowledge take Isaac up take the wood build the fire and raise the knife truth Fox that's not why God did it he wanted Abraham to see that Abraham would do it and when Abraham was pundit huh see see we think well who God stopped him yes he did because he knew Abraham was gonna finish it yeah that's what he wants from you let us make man that was Abraham's final act of faith that gave him the confidence that voice that's been talking to me all that time has me wandering around out here busting up my family my daddy's gone my nephew's gone they calling me crazy but now I know right now I know who I and brothers and sisters the reason that I minister the way I do is because I believe that God is expecting you and me to come to the conclusion of who you are and finish Genesis 1:26 and seven and eight but you see Lucifer because of the way that he thinks and God knew he let him look in there and live said I'm gonna get in there and I'm gonna put myself in there and then I can't be rejected cuz I'm his son there's a problem he didn't know the mind of God because in the crisis the mystery of God revealed brother branham informs it says God kept a few things back here in the back part of his mind now I asked you brothers and sisters what part of the mind of God were you in I'll tell you tonight because of the day we live in in the hour we live in and the signs of the times and the expectation of the scriptures that you and I are to fulfill we were in the back part of the mind of God you know he let Moses see us one time I want to see you he said okay I'll show you exactly what I look like that Moses saw the back part of the man because brothers and sisters what you and I represent now is seeing himself face to face he wouldn't let Moses see the front part because it wasn't the hour of Moses the very same reason why the prophets no longer hear like Moses he brought us up to the Jordan but Joshua is the Holy Ghost you see that's the part that Lucifer forgot about he said I want to be a son and you and I said we want to be the Holy Ghost because we're taught by the Prophet that the Holy Ghost and the spear of God are one and the same the others like the Holy Ghost is an office because of time I just love his word it's the best so let me turn a corner now that I've preached the back part of the message well I'd like to show you how we got here I'd like to show you what time it is because if the Bible will tell us what time it is I'm talking about right now I'm not talking about tomorrow I'm not talking about yesterday I'm talking about right now cuz he's that now God turn to second Thessalonians with me and let's move I'm watching the clock brother Samuel when you hold that finger up like that I'll know I'm done I guess that's an inside thing you got second Thessalonians chapter 2 oh I haven't forgot about the seal yet it's coming now we beseech you brethren verse one by the coming I love this I want you to read it with me now we beseech you brethren Paul I mean the word beseech is like compel I mean gone by the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and by our gathering together unto Him I'm pretty sure this was ad 54 nearly 2000 years ago and Paul because he's a prophet it's not only looking ahead but he's warning the people of his day okay that she be not soon shaken in mind or be troubled neither by spirit nor by word nor by letter as from us you know why Paul said that then it kind of looks like a contradiction of Paul but Paul said it because he wanted to emphasize that if an angel from heaven come and preach any other gospel than what he already preached don't believe him interesting interesting that you and I were talking about a letter that a man said he said he had brother he never had the letter because he couldn't produce it because of what Paul said let no man deceive you by any means I don't care what letter is he's backing as from us as that the day of Christ is at hand does anybody in the building use a Scofield Bible brother Wade what does it say for the phrase at hand you see the only reason that the King James translators put it like that is because they didn't have the revelation that Paul had you see Paul used now present but by saying that he would have thrown off the future generations of believers that were going to come because it's like maybe not present but the mess we're in but we've turned the corner we've turned the corner God sent us a prophet and he made sure to remind us quote after quote after quote that the coming of the Lord the coming of Christ it's right now it's now present and that was what his ministry was and that's what threw people off they said look at the madness so tremendous fillets being used oh he must be God couldn't be you know how I know that because he had to come under the atonement and God don't have to come under no atonement that's how we know Jesus Christ was God because he was the atonement that everybody else had to come under you say well what why to express his attribute you and I may be lost but the songwriter caught it under inspiration I was blind but now I see I once was lost but now I'm found I was sick but now I'm healed I love it God's Word is so tremendous the day of Christ is now present let no man deceive you by any means and believe me brothers every means that their disposal they are going to be used for that day shall not come except there come a falling away first and that man of sin be revealed the son of perdition now I realize as in time message believers we're all repeating the Pope that's the Pope have you ever heard about the purple curtain it's who's behind it it's who's behind the purple curtain we're all looking at the purple curtain and it's there and it exists and it does have a figure that we know as the Pope that represents it but it's the devil behind a purple curtain that's you and I are aware of that we've been made aware of you with me but watch this I want you to understand but as this is happening right now there are people in here who are aware of it and if you're not I'll make you aware of it I don't have to call a single name because it doesn't matter let no man deceive you by any means for that day shall not come so here's the deal ooh it's an indicator it's like a scarecrow and any intelligent Raven crow Blackbird has figured out over time scarecrow praise the Lord the good stuff is behind the Scarecrow they walk right past it you can put up those owls at the gas station Oh turn their heads and the pigeons don't care put up a scarecrow and the crows show up check it out the good stuff is gonna be here in a little while we'll come back and check it in its season this brothers and sisters looks like a scarecrow it's not the prophet of God said when you see this coming to pass don't look down look up the redemption draws nigh it's time and we and you you and I have a lot of indicators but a lot of the indicators that you and I talked about in politics and in religion our indicators that happen after it's too late this is telling us now when you see this begin to happen and the word falling away brother wait is that sounds like an awful word apostasy maybe that's why King James Court didn't put it in there because they said well it just don't look that way to us so we'll say a falling away and the reason they put falling away in there is because at the time of King James court people were changed in religions like they were changing socks and they believed that they had the central church so if you didn't believe the way they believed they're falling away but here's how sharp the enemy has gotten over time you don't have to fall away from your religion you just have to fall away from the word in the center of it I'd like to say it like this for you Bible studies we had 12 tribes of Israel and in the middle of those twelve tried four on each side their standards and their banners and their followers we had the Ark of the Covenant inside of the Tabernacle in the wilderness is that right so let me ask you all a question did Israel not have the pure unadulterated Word of God sent by God written by the finger of God nobody is gonna could tell well people contested but we know as believers no that's that's truth brother and what was this wheel doing paying so little attention to the Ark of the Covenant who's who's whose position is hers whose word is more important than who's God said well they're not paying any attention to me so I'll let the Ark be stolen they don't really care see see the falling away really the falling away is to discontinue to pay attention to what's most important all right so brothers and sisters you don't have to go anywhere tonight to follow me because the word is not fall away its apostasy and here's what the word apostasy means so that I can bring you back around to let us make man you see Satan is doing everything he can to interfere with one thing only one the manifestation that's what he did in the Garden of Eden he interfered with the manifestation of the sons of God by entering in to the stream of God's sons lineage and now you and I are all sitting in here tonight me standing up before you with that the part we don't like the part that's getting old the part that's decaying the part that fusses and fumes the part that gets mad the part that gets frustrated the part that don't like this and don't like that let us make man God has given us the mandate God has given us the ingredients God has given us the recipe but let me tell you folks something making the cake is one thing I believe that's why God sent a prophet but the corn of wheat abideth law let's have fallen to the ground and die so more ingredients can come out of it so more cakes can come forth but here's the kicker not enough to make the cake somebody got to eat it somebody got to take a slice that's why Jesus said unless you eat the flesh and drink the blood of the son of man you haven't alive and they go what we got for cake yeah but I want you to eat it I want you to consume it I want you to take the Word of God that I represent as the son of God he's saying and I want you to consume it why what was the purpose brother Samuel to replenish you see brothers and sisters that's where the devil's holding us all up what is the original seed thank you so in order for every seed to bring forth after its kind what kind of seed will it bring for a spoken word that's the reason why you got people over here saying we're finished with the Prophet and you got people over saying it's only the Prophet because those two factions are places to fall and they in themselves become the definition of apostasy by definition no I'm not impugning anybody but I am gonna give you a slice of cake now present and apostasy we read the definition of apostasy out of the plain old dictionary that you go to Barnes and Nobles and get is an act of refusing to continue to follow obey or recognize a religious faith I didn't make it up and brothers and sisters I was preaching on this weeks ago when he came to my attention that people are falling left and right people are running off over there and saying the Prophet is God people are running off over here saying this word don't matter anymore apostasy failing to continue and they say well all's we needs the Holy Ghost well I'll tell you they ain't got it I'll tell you why I know they ain't got it because in what is the Holy Ghost paragraph 54 what did he coming you for what did he come in me for what's to continue the works of God and apostasy seems to fail to continue so if you fail to continue you have fallen away [Applause] and I believe as much as anybody on the planet of listening to the message I'd say tapes but nobody's got tapes anymore I'll just say the message I can say tapes you understand what I mean the message her brothers and sisters just listening to tapes is only staring at the cake you see because a corn of wheat abideth alone and I believe that what's on those tapes is the pure unadulterated kernel germ of God but guess what happens brothers and sisters it abides it alone unless it's taken in to the ground you remember the earth we talked about the earth he was going to use but it was in darkness take the seed in and let the light shine this little light of mine you know the way it starts out of sunlight sunlight in my soul today sunlight sunlight all along the way but after you get a long ways down the way it's this little light of mine I'm gonna let it shine why because GLAAD's spoken word requires something it requires the production of another spoken word because every seed brings forth after its kind so the spoken word of God doesn't stop it continues to bring forth after its kind and the end result brothers and sisters for you and me you may be listening to me shout at you and preach to you but the end result of what I'm telling you is if you say when you say and it comes to pass and you say well brother I've done that but but God's not a creature of time you and I are going hmm come on now I said it and it ain't come to pass so I must not be a believer because these signs follow them that believe right don't be deceived by the letter what you're interested in is the life that's the reason why I bought that brought this big old giant avocado seed up here is because there's life in this seed now I only know it's an avocado see because I took it out of one right did you realize that the spoken word is the original seat but this seed is not doing any good in this ziplock bag it's a matter of fact if I leave it in here long enough it'll rot and decay now watch this has anybody ever heard brother branham say that if you put too much powder in a 222 swift and you fired at the squirrel of the groundhog it just stares at you that's what the groundhogs do out well we Lambert prairie dogs they call him cousin but they bark then the squirrels chatter chatter chatter chatter chatter chatter what happened too much powder and the bullet disintegrated before it got to the the game right he said where are you going with this oh but if you rent the rest of the story you'll find out that if you wait long enough it could be a million it could be a bin and it could be a trillion years I don't know how long it's gonna take but that will come back to be a bullet again he said light a piece of paper on fire and turned it into ash and gas and back into the air he says wait long enough and it'll become the seed of a tree it'll grow tall and strong and somebody will come and cut it down and put it in the meal and make a piece of paper right I believe that but what's that's not where it stops if I let this avocado seed rot in this baggie it's got life in it I don't know how long it'll take and I don't even have to question how God does it but guess what at some point the life that's in this seed will eventually become another avocado tree now we should be able to see that oh now let me take it to the next level how about the life of God they can refuse it they can abuse it but it's gonna find another seed to rest in and brothers and sisters don't be afraid that seed is a spoken word and God said let us make man did you realize that he's allowing you and me to come into his laboratory and become a child of God with those simple words how do we do it brother can you give me the formula yes I can faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the Word of God you say well I I listen to the tapes all the time that's the problem you're listening you're not hearing I'm not making fun of anybody but I'll just be blunt you've heard the mantra press play and obey I believe in that the problem is hardly anybody's obey because if they obeyed what was being played they'd realize that Satan is trying to block us for becoming the manifestation of the sons of God found in Romans 8 I believe brother Branham was the manifestation of a son of God but that don't fulfill description because that's not what the scripture says the scripture says the sons and that includes you ladies daughters of God you realize that it's not a one-man operation listen if God wanted to remain a one-man operation he would have just stayed hello him but he wanted to express himself in the form of attributes which I believe are sitting in the room tonight one of them happens to be preaching to you I believe that I am an attribute of God how brother show us show us a sign you're looking at you're looking at the sign if you knew me before God called me you'd say ain't nobody ever gonna save that guy my wife knew me before I was saved well we both had to get saved and I say this with all honesty God knows my heart brothers and sisters please don't ever think that someone can't be saved because it's not a fight against flesh and blood but we realized by definition if somebody is going to work apostasy into their lives they need prayer all right they need a conversion all right you see because the Holy Ghost is to continue the works of God and apostasy is an act of refusing to continue it also means in the second definition abandonment I love this one brother Samuel it's so plain abandonment of a previous loyalty oh yeah I used to believe the message but I don't know anymore pastas don't try to figure it out don't try to reason it you see that's what the devil got Eve to do to interfere with the manifestation of the sons of God which would have been Adam's lineage then in Adams lineage was Jesus Christ that's why he's our elder brother now in the spoken word is the original seed brother Branham begins to explain to us how this transpires are you still with me brother Sam man held his finger up yet I'll just keep going I'm I want to be obedient you love it how about this continue did you know what the word continue means to fail to continue the word continue means to keep doing something in the same way I like this as before no not the old sinful man that we were but Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever to keep happening or existing to remain active to maintain without interruption so in this brother Samuel there's no sixth seal for the bride because she's been judged already she's been judged on Calvary we don't have to entertain the sixth seal which is an interruption of nature if we'll just continue now I realize that I'm preaching to people that go I don't know about that you know what brother I think you're off your rocker yes I am sure I am off my rocker wanting to eat the cake brother Samuel I'm I'm tired of staring at the cake I believe in the cake I know that it's ingredients where they came from I know who put all the recipe together and how it arrived yeah but now it's time to not only eat the cake but to become the ingredients which is the spoken word for you and me you see every seed brings forth after its kind that's the reason why brothers and sisters I see that the devil is trying to put it on to that he's trying to impugn and remove and desecrate the fivefold ministry why because God hath placed I didn't write it in the Bible look I'll be true totally honest with you even if I'm not one of God's chosen five full ministers I believe in him you know why I believe in them because it's for the perfecting of the Saints and Paul in Hebrews six says let us go on to perfection now brothers and sisters I'd like to say it like this if I was to show a hands and we got Ford Chevy and dodge and then some foreign truck drivers in here right none of them perfect they don't come and tell me your Ford is better than that brother Chevy and don't tell me your Dodge is better than that brothers Ford because that's not perfection the word perfection means maturity it doesn't mean you like blue and your neighbor painted their house red and it ain't perfect it is to your neighbor but how about maturity that's what we're looking for and the fivefold ministry that God hath placed is for the maturity of the saints what maturity do you and I need we need to become the grain the full grain the grain that bends down that God planted in the beginning and said let us make man that right Satan interfered with that and here's the deal the whole world Bible says in Romans the whole world the whole creation do you realize that takes in the universe and the galaxies and the stars and the moons and the sputnik's that are going out there brother Branham said at one day they're gonna find out they're just looking at the back of themselves I can't wait till it comes to the paper our 10 trillion dollar thing that we sent out there he's looking at the back of us what's the deal well just going on home with the message I believe it but see they don't see it the way you and I see it you and I are being put upon by the Word of God to become the manifestation of the sons of God which the whole creation is waiting for and I'm human like you I think I use it well what what brother if you're missing the mark what if it's what if it's a hundred years from now then we'll be waiting on them and the message we're preaching today is a stepping stone for them if this is not the hour but according to Thessalonians we're seeing it because in the Bible it says falling away but the prophet of God put emphasizing it like Paul said we beseech you he said great falling away he don't say that in the Bible but I believe it it don't even say in Matthew 24:24 that it would be so close that it would deceive the very elect but by revelation and because we believe God sent a prophet we receive it I receive it and then you then we ask ourselves Lord how is it possible I happen to know you're preaching on it right now brother Samuel the two spirits what two spirits there's only one Spirit of God yeah but it's what it anoints a lot of people think it's a false anointing no it's what it's anointing his false the seed playing his day that's why brother Branham couldn't see it for all those years went to his cave come out Hebrews six hmm have you ever read Hebrews six did you know that Hebrews 6 is apostasy says it right in the margin of the Bible therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ let us go on unto perfection come on don't you see why the devil is trying to stop God's placed fivefold ministry now not everybody that calls themselves apostles prophets pastors evangelists and teachers are such they may have a calling in their life but give some callings without repentance so they have a gift that's being used I want to tell you folks something especially you young people who love music those people are gifted to the max but no repentance and notice that they all think well not all of them we got some different ones now but most of them think they're serving God well in a sense they are because all life comes from God think about it Eve had King the son of perdition he was not God's son but Eve spoke truth when she said I've gotten a man from the Lord now you and I wouldn't be able to comprehend that without the recipe the recipe said look in the ingredients and you'll see that all life comes from God so an order for even Cain to be born it had to be because of the Word of God he just wasn't born by the Word of God you still with me see I'm not used to preaching this long but I'll keep going I'm used to being able to bring it in little bitty snippets is it time okay alright you love it I hope you're getting something out of this the foundation of repentance from dead works thank you and our fate toward God of the doctrine of baptism a haunt of hands and a resurrection of the Dead and of eternal judgment those really sound important because they are but you and I should have been moved past that by now it's going to be 2020 at midnight tonight for you and I that's here in the state of Georgia and 2020 represents by science really really really good vision it's not perfect vision cuz I already had my wife and I knows a brother from Colombia was the typology as a brother it's gonna be 20/20 you know that's that's the prophets eyes looking down upon us cuz well I'm gonna be honest he believes in the return I said well I Got News for your brother if you read your message carefully you'll find out that the Prophet didn't have 20/20 vision here 2015 something must have happened in 1977 huh brother Samuel something must have happened in 2050 you see what I'm saying brothers and sisters but God doesn't make you and I aware of it because he wants us to become the expression of his attributes and stop looking at the clock it's funny how that we're so weak that we cut a church you know I don't want to know the church mom I don't want to go to church dad it's like killing me get the phone out of your hand you got the thing there you know 20 hours of the day people driving down the road with their phones in their hand oh my wife's I hope there's somebody texting you get it beside him and sure enough they're texting and putting on their makeup at the same time while they're driving come on who's the sisters this is life but because life is invisible if I chopped open that seed of the avocado you're not going to see the life but if I plant that baby and I watch over it and I keep it you know what's really interesting about the parable of the sower in Matthew 13 did you realize that the seed is the word of God that's wild because in that parable we find out that it's not the seed that's the difference maker because there's lots of people following the Bible and the message it's the ground it falls in and you'll realize that each stage of the parable of the sower Matthew 13 you enter into and hopefully you come out of it until you become the good grind see now I realize all brick predestinate her brother on the good ground to begin with really the Bible says you were born in sin ship they're literally coming in the world speaking lies full of trouble in shorter days but I believe that little spirit that enter into that little body when you were born had something in it an element in it that God was tracking you didn't know it I didn't know it but one day and God said let us make man huh who was that are you kidding me I'm doing everything I can to make the greatest man on earth you see what I'm saying yeah I was a motocross racer I found out that you had to work hard brother you had to work on the bike you had to practice practice practice and if you had a gift or a talent you could win but guess what another Sunday I had to win in another Sunday I had to win on another Sunday I don't have another Sunday after a while I got to be like sis it man is this all the rest of life now I think I'm on top of my game and this is it know something inside of me and you that's the reason you're here tonight is calling you to a much much much higher higher higher life you've got it in you you're craving it whether you know it or not but the problem with the age we live in is distraction you see that's what God did or Saint excuse me that's what Satan did in the Garden of Eden was distracted Eve just long enough don't you think that's what he's doing to our young people today it's all a distraction I'm gonna tell you all something them cell phones are not gonna give you eternal life as a matter of fact if you're not careful they'll shorten your life [Applause] that's you know well I believe that brother Lewis I'm gonna wind up okay cuz you could just there's no stopping I remember an elderly man that's old now was a good preacher in his day but I heard him in the early 80s he said preaching the word like driving your car up a one-lane Mountain Road there's no place to get off you can't back up so you just got to continue till you get to the top I said that makes a lot of sense and I don't even know if I was a preacher back then do you love him please stand I mean we can see there's so much but it's it's okay I'll read one thing last thing to you to sum it up while the musicians are coming page 104 of adoption part 4 in this particular publication tell me my brother tell me my sister when was the time that the sons of God was ever to be manifested outside of this time now when were there every time in the history those that manifest the time I love that to deliver all nature nature's the nature itself is groaning waiting for the time of the manifestation why before the atonement was made before the Holy Ghost was ever poured out before all the Old Testament on down there there couldn't have been manifestation but yet God said let us make man but there couldn't have been manifestation at that time I'll tell you why because light was busy looking for dark earth to separate the darkness from so then it could shine see that God put in that spirit it had to wait till this time now all things has been brought coming shaping up to a headstone to a manifestation of sons of God coming back and the Spirit of God coming into these man plural let us so perfectly until their ministry th e ir will be so close like Christ and the day of Christ is now present till it will join him and his church together praise the Lord you love him happy new year almost I'll just say god bless you [Applause] thank you let's sing a song with you then we'll change the order and get things a little different but in case anybody has a need we don't ever want to quit when somebody in there has a meeting so if you have a need come forth and let's pray with you and we'll go into the rest of

Lord his presence with it for all of you coming and being together and enjoyed all these people here and to the ones from Chile we have thoroughly enjoyed being with us with this thank you for coming always be a door open here that you can come in and fellowship with us and have a good time in the Lord shows us that's what we're trying to invest today amen we we've got about five minutes we've always just try to take the communion just as we finish over into the watch you know finish and into the next year well we just tell everybody we appreciate you appreciate this year we've had a good time it's been really a good year of fellowship and and all we've had a lot of good ministry brother and come through and preach for us this year and it's been great so you know we appreciate that that gives me a change these brothers taking over gives me a chance to kind of relax a little and not not have to be burdened because that's that's to do and I'm coughing like crazy now the reason I turned over that way do the communion I mean y'all wouldn't want me to break the bread okay it wouldn't bother me and I could stop hitting anything do whatever wouldn't bother me but some people you know in their mind I think well he's them coughing it you know maybe he coughed him on his peace when we wake up on that pick okay I will make those we just have it to the whole thing all right but we have had a good time we appreciate all of you that have been here with us this year we really would appreciate it we look forward to another year because I do always look forward to a new day a new thing a new coming a new new beginning because an end as I said when we look at the word in we think it means to stop it doesn't mean that the Bible says Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to them that believe it well how could it be this to stop for some end it's not to stop always when you see that word in look for a new beginning look for something to start instead of something to end that way you'll always be looking forward and seeing him and that way you can always rejoice in him and say thank you Lord for bringing me through all of this I thought it's been him it's been him all through every one of us our hearts and lives and things and a lot of things that's taken place in this year that you know this is an election year coming up who cares you know everybody argues over who's gonna be President the Bible says I put in Kings I take out Kings that solves that it ain't nothing to us I don't care where anybody voted or what not if God wants Hillary in the White House and nobody but one person votes you get it because that's God's work if he won't hurt our he'll be there that doesn't matter because it doesn't have anything to do with all of what we think you know the machines back there one fella remember had it they had it set up you push one button to push voting for this guy for president you'd automatically voting for the other one and they wouldn't do a thing about it they knew all about those it doesn't matter what does it matter who's gonna be President mm-hmm its sons and daughters of a living God making their selves ready to get out of this world I'm enjoying being it I've enjoyed myself be 80 years old in a I've enjoyed that it's been a wonderful time to me I don't want to go back I want to go far would if I get 10 more years praise God I get ten seconds praise God it doesn't make no difference with me because that's where I have no fear death loss a long time ago I got born again that solved that problem there was no such death to a Christian you can't die you just step over in another dimension and waiting on the rest of them waiting on everybody else to come along alright but we do appreciate everything and we just say to all of you you know we'll go down start after we finished the communion and we'll eat and fellowship together and there's plenty of food so don't go out to try to buy something or do something to stay and eat with us and and we'll have a good time fellowshipping and and all like that but be careful on your way home because they'll start out there and they're buying Hoople off in all the world they're drinking and running and doing but all we got to do is just rest in Christ so let's just think about that we'll pray we'll ask God to be with all it and then turn it over to wait and let him do the communion father we've had a wonderful time this year and we thank you sometimes it's been hard sometimes it's been rough but it was never to be nothing more than for our benefit that you Lord allowed us to see you and demand let you be made manifest among us in your love in your care and we pray that you'd bless each one thank you for our brother come in tonight and be another brother long and being with us and we pray that as he travels on back home he and his wife that you'll give them a safe journey and that everything be all right because we want to do that and as we finish up here and ending our parts and the people on the way home give everybody a safe journey just let your love come guide the cars and take care of all things we thank you for all of it thank you for the word that we've heard tonight because that's the main thing in our hearts and lives is the word for the generation that we're living - worthy we're here we thank you have your way now we commit it all to you in Jesus name it's a new year new decade while we're standing let's give a brother nailing at hand [Applause] you know there's the world right now at twelve o'clock that dropping the ball at Times Square they got all the headliners they got all the country singers and the people that are stars and all these things and half the people are drunk and the other half are getting there we've got drunk alone holy ghost tonight and I believe we had we had so go ahead we had some of the headliners right here [Applause] they think they rule the world they're just here as squatters it's just temporary we got the cream of the crop right here hey man so god bless you let's turn on your Bibles if you want to follow along in first Corinthians 11 verse 23 Paul speaking for I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread and when he had given thanks he breaking us and take eat this is my body which is broken for you that's doing remembrance of me after the same manner also he took the cup when he had supped saying this cup is the New Testament it was starting a new beginning a new era the Old Testament was heading out in the new testament was coming in but it had to be in his blood because without the death of a testator there was no Testament to be enforced so he was getting ready to enforce the Testament this cup is the New Testament in my blood this do ye as oft as you drink it in remembrance of me but as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup you do show the Lord's death till he comes wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord but let a man examine himself that's what we need to do tonight and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh damnation and to himself not discerning the Lord's body but this cause many are weak and sickly among you and many sleep for judge ourselves we should not be judged but when we are judged we are chastened of the Lord that we should not be condemned with this world wherefore my brethren when you come together to eat tarry one for another and if any man hunger let him eat at home that you come not together unto condemnation and the rest of all I said in order when I come let's just have a moment of silent prayer property God told us to pray for your pastor if you have any Fault in your mind and in your heart you need to get it out now if you have anything hindering you you need to talk to the Lord now but let's take a moment of silence before we protect this communion thank you Lord we ask your blessings in Jesus name Amen Bible said he took the bread blessed the only father we ask Lord as you would bless this part of the service Lord that we take your part of this and we break it Lord symbolizing the broken body Lord that you took for us father so that we could be saved and have salvation Lord we thank you for that Lord we pray that you just be with this burn them under this service Lord take care of us in Jesus name while we're doing this I want to make sure that you know that next weekend on Saturday we started three o'clock we'll have questions and answers one will actually be on the communion for the young people starting at 3 o'clock when they're Nathanael Greene will be with us from Joe Greenstein and he will also spend and be with us Sunday afternoon so come at 3 o'clock and be with us and then we'll have the regular Bible study our first one of the year from 6 o'clock to 8 o'clock on the same evening downstairs and home-loving sure never want any thank you for an opportunity to be here my brother Chris and sister Johanna they become real good in store for us and you know what we ain't got long we don't got long we better hurry up and start doing something yeah God's waiting on you and I the only father would pray that you bless this wine more than just be assembled it Lauren it never gets old it never gets bad Lord but it keeps getting better and better Lord like your word father that we heard tonight and the word that we've heard in the past now we Lord we look toward the future but the word that's coming Lord may you truly turn our water into wine Lord that we make you swear that your father give a stimulation of Revelation bless us now in this program of the service in Jesus name come morning oh by the river [Music] through the midnight think about it [Music] for me sometimes I'm despised and rejected and I questioned all father how then I take one more look at Mount Calvary and it gives me the strength to cool come morning oh brother Brown said between 6:00 and 9:00 one morning we're gonna cross over we're gonna be over there the evergreen tree I'll carry my cross through the midnight call morning there's glory for me while they're passing it out I want to thank Chilean brothers again for being here with us and they've been a they've been a boost to my spirit so you know thank you for coming it's it's just a pleasure for you to be here both Suresh Lords you kids are getting you're getting old the kids the kids here the kids are growing up and Wow we remember when they were just a little Sharon was just in a little a crib Lord times past but God bless you thanks for coming to our brother Dutch we talked to him today tell him that we'll see him in a few weeks cool we'll be over there middle of January sometimes so so god bless you and all the ones that here the my brother here in front he's been here before Daniel and Debbie I think they get the they get the prize for the longest commute they Frodo know Chris and Johannah gets the longest commute okay so yeah but they flew yeah well they drove so so driving it was good to have dangling Debbie they're only just a wonderful part of the church and and and brother David and his crowd it's just good to have them with you - with us - and and brother sister Fleeman couldn't have you guys - always good to have you with us and we see you sign a lot so that's okay and your daughter - that's all right but good have each and every one of you here this new year coming up if we've never been this way before right but you know that was a provision made in the Old Testament they told them I said you've never been in this way before it just followed the priests follow the leading leadership of the Lord follow and you'll he'll take her to the promised land I promise we'll get there he promised it bro Chris somebody's gonna make it and I'm just I tell her I'm just dumb enough believe that he's talking about me like you said at Genesis 1:26 man y'all know that's my favorite skip to the free zone it's up to us you're right free moral agency a man who loves the Lord man we're coming to a time now where you know brother Brown said one time he said it's later than you think well that's that was 60 years ago so it's late so we need to get our provisions ready get everything right with the Lord I think we're on the right track we're trying the best to get to get to youth to get together and get the older people together and we'll have them somebody start preaching on a revival maybe somewhere everybody ready remember the Lord when you do this remember the Lord thank you thank you Jesus less so there's our getting the they're getting the cuffs or any and get toward the back I want to say again thank you for all coming it's been a great year we've I think we've accomplished a lot we've seen people growing God and that's the best thing in the world is to see people grow and see people you got a lot of youth here now so we thank God for that man we just want to pray that each and every one of us are buying closer together my brother Chris said and I know all of you know that a lot of situations are happening in the message in the last couple of months that you thought would probably never happen but I'm telling you the devil he's a good adversary but I'll promise you one thing God already knows he already knew and made provisions we just got to step right into that into that provision like brother Chris is talking about we got to eat that cake like John did in Revelation 10 we got to eat it and make it disappear inside of us amen god bless you we're gonna pray over the food before with anybody all Minds clear everything okay go downstairs have a good time eat fellowship a little bit the world's out there drinking and and you know throwing firecrackers at each other so let's go down and talk about the Lord Jesus Christ amen let's bow our heads the Heavenly Father would thank you for this night that you give us Lord this day not a 24-hour day but the day of the Lord is a hand it's here Lord we pray that you just sanctifies for this journey we were the ones Lord on the highways that you'll clear the highways back Lord as they travel home be with our Chilean brothers and the ones Lord that are here father that you will protect them and keep them safe and Lord Jesus bring them back here Lord that they can give us some testimony and testify the things that God's done in for your country father we pray that you sanctify the food that will nourish our bodies forgive us of our sins it would bind together and closer to you Lord as this year comes up Lord coming to the time Lord that we now have got a new time a new era a new decade father we pray that you would just raise us up in you father give us revelation more than anything because we want to live off of that Lord or not anything else we pray these things Lord in the lovely wonderful marvelous name the only name above heaven where man needs to be saved the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and mrs. Lord Jesus Christ says hey man you're dismissed god bless you
