========================================

my heart Jesus I surer jesus I surrender all Jesus I surrender all the king my heart amen good to be in the house of the Lord good to have each every one of you here thank you for uh coming on the middle of the week time when uh everybody's tired and weary and we're going to talk about to the Lord a little bit if that's all right I can make that a little bit bigger getting there how about that that better okay all right uh go ahead and be I need to make a couple of announcements um number one pray for brother Aaron bless his heart he just called he's got U his either his basement or his house is flooded with water the electric heater I ain't going to make us a Doctrine but if you'll get you a gas heater that won't happen I have never had electric water yeah water heater I think we had one one time in the trailer we lived in and it did the same thing so get you a gas one exactly so but pray for him he's uh he's battling that tonight so just uh pray for him that he will get that thing fixed also uh brother George Quinn is as brother Ryan announced will be here this weekend with us we're going to Ruth tomorrow um mom and sister Jo and myself and jun's going and coming back on um Friday afternoon so just keep us in prayer uh brother George Quinn did a little uh did a memorial for uh for dad today and didn't know brother George could play the guitar but brother George since we saw him online playing the guitar guess what brother George is going to do when he gets here Sunday he may not know it yet but I'll let him know Saturday that he's going to play the guitar so H am I good what's wrong is it me or y'all I'm fading in and out I'm not fading in and out my voice might be but I'm not I hope I'm doing all right so anyway brother George will be here um the 18th which will be the next Sunday after I'll be at Brother Richard Wilson brother Aaron and brother um Bob will be taking the service we'll be at Brother Richard Wilson's for that weekend uh also this coming Sunday the Lord willing uh we're going to have a ordination service we have a new Deacon um brother Brother Anderson marunga is going to be a a deacon in our church and we're going to uh um do a Serv ordination service and also brother Danny Fountain going to be a new trustee so we are uh happy that uh that we are uh adding some too and people are growing and and they're uh surely qualified to do the job and also some of the things that we discussed reason I'm going to tell you now is because there's going to be a few changes and like brother Keith said a lot of people online this is going to affect them more than it is you at right now but we're going to start doing um now you continue to pay your tithe and offering the same way you're doing it but we will have an option on our website to donate money or pay TI or to uh contribute to the building fund all right so we're going to do that online brother Joe and brother Lise and sister Lisa is going to get together and we will have that option you don't have to do it but it's just an option um we've had a sister in Canada that's been watching since about January and she's been trying to pay her ties so we're going to make it where they can do it a little bit better and U and a little bit more smooth uh we do it all the time let's don't get all let's don't get all giddy about it as more money probably goes through through electronic now than it does in the hands of the people right brother John yeah so that's just the way it is and we hope and we there's filters and there's prayer amen that we can make sure this thing goes right also now starting on the 8th of September all right actually it starts the 1st of September but that's uh communion Sunday but on the 8th of September we will be doing away with our second service all right couple of reasons for that couple of things have come up that we have I've been praying about it for about two months and we won't have a second service per se as usual all right we're going to start about 10 we'll start at 10: in the morning and we'll continue our service reason being number one we have the word established in our heart I hope now some of you young ones may not but you're getting there everybody with me but there's got to be some Dynamics on that mechanics right everybody with me amen there's got to be worship Sunday was a prime example brother Keith he he went a little long that's okay but about 10 minutes till 12 everybody in the building pretty much starts looking at the wife and getting nervous about coming up to 12:00 I got to cook my food I got to do this I got to do that and then we wanted to worship there was some of you worshiping with your hands up and and um and weeping but we had to cut the service short because we had to stop yeah we we could have continued on but that would have squeezed everything together and made us all nervous so what we're going to do is try to have now one Quality Service instead of two quantity services now and the service will run we'll do just about the same format but we'll be able to worship more free after the service is over we want to worship I Believe In Worship I believe in the word but remember in the Bible the children of Israel set what first the singers the singers went first and the singers is what helped in the battle because they got the mood set right right so we're going to try this until the end of the year there's 16 Sundays left and a couple of them we weren't going to have second service anyway but we're going to try that but also the first Sunday of every month that's why I'm going to announce this the whole month the first Sunday of every month we will have communion so we will excuse me we will have a second service the first Sunday of every month all right because we will do our communion service then also we have option to do uh now we can do bible study on Sunday afternoon instead of coming all back up here on Saturday we can have it on Sunday afternoon we can have our questions and answers brother Dell had questions and answers remember and he'd take a whole second service and do questions and answers so we're not doing away and we're not shunning our responsibilities we're just going to shift it around a little bit to where I think we can be a little more efficient in our worship service where we don't have to keep looking at our watch and and cut off then maybe the spirit of the Lord wants to move a little bit more and we are on time restraints and we're not going to do that anymore so we're going to try it just pray about it um I got a couple of good text messages a little bit ago in uh in a email from somebody that said they really think it'll work if we'll let it work it'll work we can also have a youth service in the afternoon some Sunday afternoon if we want to some us stay over uh like brother Joe if we're going to do we're going to do the worship service still like we did once every other month and then brother John will be able to we weave all that in to let him do his financial peace um service there if if need be and then we will have um time to have our worship song service and uh and brother joke and we're going to get a schedule together like I said before we're not just going to end it and cut out of here and and shun our responsibilities no probably 90% of the time I'll be here and like brother Joe suggested too that if you want to come and stay in Fellowship what do we do outside when we get done we stand out there for two hours in Fellowship okay so let's just bring a meal we Fellowship downstairs and if there's any questions if anybody the kids want to practice or we can there's a lot of options by having one good quality service and and I'm sorry but if you're if you're one of these then I'm talking to you 20% of the people don't come back to second service no way so you've already decided to have just one service a Sunday amen and it takes away from being the sleepy and all that stuff and Sunday afternoon we all get that way but like brother Louise said he said uh now what about eating I said well you better eat about 915 if y'all don't eat breakfast you better learn to eat breakfast it's the most important meal of the day y'all don't read that because we you may not getting finished till 1:00 on a on a service but listen you sleep with a full stomach you stay awake when your stomach's growling cuz you want to get to that next meal boy aren't we a creature is a habit but we're going to try that we'll have a lot of more options we will have um a schedule set starting in September but remember the first Sunday in September is the first and we will have communion so it will stay the way it is first Sunday the second starting on on 98 there'll be no scheduled structured second service all right and the first service could go as long as we want to worship I I just believe in worship I believe we've got the word but we've got to have some some Dynamics to go on that mechanics mechanics is not only going to get us out of here it's going to take the spirit inside of usly worshiping God to get us to the next level I believe so um I appreciate everybody uh paying attention and listening but I will make this announcement every Sunday um until we come up to that to that time so let's stand to our feet and we're going to we're going to jump into uh we're going to background just a little bit but we're going to start into the age of Pentecost Daniel defo said the soul is placed in the body like a rough diamond and must be polished or the luster of it will never appear the soul is placed in the body like a rough diamond and must be polished or the luster of it will never appear I think that's wonderful let's bow our heads thear heavenly father thank you for this evening Lord the middle of the week where we can serve you Lord I pray that you be with us now in this service Lord open our eyes that we may see and our ears that we may hear you Lord and what you're saying in this age and in the end time lord as Brother Richard Wilson said several times it's a new season it's a new time it's a it's a new era that we're working in now that Lord we're taking this Lord and and we pray that it'll be pleasing in your eyes Lord as we come together we don't want to be just here as as as having a service here and a service there but Lord let our service be a continual service Lord let us commune with you every day father and it makes it much easier when you come into the house of God for you to speak to us Lord now you said where two or three are gathered in your name you'd be in the midst so tonight Lord there's more than that and Lord if there be any needs if there be anything Lord that is troubling someone in their life Lord I pray that you'd speak to them tonight and Lord that you'll be with the ones that are sick sister Johnny and the different ones Lord and be brother Aaron Lord and give him wisdom on that on that um um thing that he's working on and and the hot water heater and Lord we got a we got an air conditioner unit that's on one leg so we pray Lord that you'd help that thing too Lord I pray that you'd touch everything in this building the people especially Lord be with each one father and just bless us now in Jesus name amen son of man this will be we will start we're going to background for a minute but if you'll remember the scripture says Alpha and Omega so the alpha bride and Omega bride has to be the same but they have to have a foundation just the same that's right everybody with me you come from the Old Testament the Old Testament comes in they had a day of Pentecost we'll talk about that here in just a little bit then you had Paul coming at the end of that Pentecostal age to bring his message number one the message one first church age now you we're over here now we've almost finished with six all right and we're getting into the last or the Omega message or the last message of the end time and to get to that last message CU remember look Paul was a prophet right all these others were yeah they were considered prophets but not Major Prophets Paul was a major prophet all right brother Brandon was a major prophet so you had your two book ends but they had to have a foundation of Pentecost now not Pentecostal denomination Pentecost by experience so there had to be then now at the end time between the sixth and seventh Church age there had to be an age of Pentecost right all right we'll get into that now that age of Pentecost is going to be as we were talking about the outer Court inner Court holy of holies we're getting ready to enter into the holy of holies amen all right if you've not entered into the holy of holies if you don't have the new birth just listen for a little while maybe God will strike your heart and give you Clarity on what the new birth is all right cuz it's very important if it started the church ages and it started it right it's got to end to church age right amen CU you got your Alpha and Omega all right so Revelations 1 said I was in the spirit on the Lord's day and I heard behind me a great voice as of a trumpet saying I am Alpha and Omega the first and the last he made sure he was going to start it right he made sure he was going to end it right right cuz it's all anyway it's not us it's him right but it's his plan it's a master plan it's a plan that won't fail listen it's a plan he's already been through right it's ain't new to God tomorrow's new to us brother John but not to God the whole end of this thing is not new to God so he orchestrated the whole thing and he did it as the Bible says for his own will but he had you in mind or he would have never had an alpha bride a church a bride and then an Omega bride to end this thing up he' have never had that he didn't need us but he wanted to he wanted to be father he wanted to be husband amen I am Alpha and Omega the first and the last and what thou see us right in a book and send it to the seven churches which are in Asia there's your seven Church ages Leota being the end now see it doesn't announce anywhere in here that there's a Pentecostal age but if the alpha bride has to be like the Omega bride how it started the way this one's got to start right and even brother random tells us I'll read you the quote right the very end brother R said no Messenger to that age because the Holy Ghost came himself but what happened on the day of Pentecost no Messenger to that age right Peter was the spokesperson not the messenger uh the oneeyed black men daddy Seymour uh param they were Messengers they were SP spokesman but then Here Comes brother brandom stepping right out of that Pentecostal age right into the bride age are the layout of seeing age and then we're called out of it and I turned to see the voice of SP and being turned I saw seven golden candlesticks and in the midst of those seven candles sticks one likened to the son of man cloth with the Garment down to the foot and G about the PS with the golden girdle you may be seated the Lord has blessings remember the second stage we were looking at the other day you there's where the candlesticks show up it is an AR arcial light now listen there's nothing artificial in God no all right but as a type sanctification you can put those lights out hello it's say you can be Sanctified and go to hell that's right hello sure you can be just Sanctified and die and go to hell it's required that you go into that holy of holies where it was not man's light it was God's light amen God met you in there a priest didn't meet you in there God met you in there right now priest had to go in in the Old Testament but that types me and you going in to get the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen and we'll read that here in just a little bit so Acts 2 verse1 says when the day of Pentecost now I know everybody that's been here a long time you know what Penta means Pentecost 50 on the day of Pentecost it actually happened on the very day that it was supposed to happen on praise God God perfect it was the day of Pentecost the 50th Jubilee or the 50th day after what the killing of the Lamb all right they were all in with one Accord in one place and suddenly there came a sound from Heaven as of a rushing Mighty Wind and it filled all the house where they were sitting there appeared under them clo and tongues like as of fire and it sat upon each one of them and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost 120 people men and women were filled with the Holy Ghost and one time because God promised them he said if you'll go up there you'll be endued with power from on high right amen and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost and began to speak with tongues or other tongues as the spirit gave them utterance so now if you'll see here I don't know if you can see that or not but you got the first part over there says Pentecost that's where we're at right now right in the book of Acts all right then remember we come back over here now we see the open door the overlap we see that there's another Pentecostal age right here to usher in the age of Le if Alpha has got to be the same as Omega it's got to be pictures it's got to be mirror images of what happened in one's going to happen in the other that's why the full word of God was in those first three ages the the am I just not on here at all how about now it helped to turn the thing on praise the Lord I'll be 65 in a few months I think is that better Richard I had it it was off I thought it had it on but it's off huh thank you so can I go back over here now okay all right so you you got book ends Pentecostal age is just the one we just talked about there's another one coming right here that's going to what restore back the gifts but remember it's not going to restore back the word yet that's what the prophet was sent to do all right now look they had the word listen this acts two this acts that we just read which is Acts 2 ver1 that fell on sons of God that had been tutored by the Lord Jesus himself not a second person not a third person God tutored them for three and A2 years right and he packed in them all he could pack in them but they had no power they lied they cut people's ear off they ran they cursed that sound like a good Holy Ghost group of people right didn't think so but when they but Jesus told him and I'll read it in a minute he said go to Jerusalem and you'll be in Ed with power from on high so what happened was they had that word in their heart and the Holy Ghost fell on that part of the word that there to fulfill which was the full word it was the word himself the only problem was there was no headstone there Christ wasn't there anymore in physical form everybody with me the son of man had left this is not the son of man coming in Acts two it's the Son of God it's the Holy Ghost all right a ghost we know he's the person of Jesus Christ but it wasn't the man standing there so they got that Son of God Revelation carried it all the way through and then man as we've been through it before listen man has tore this relig this Bible to pieces with religion they tore the word of God to Pieces brother Brown said what bound at the river Euphrates by what denominational Creeds right that's that's why God can't work in his church when you and I have Creeds and you and I have thoughts that are not according to God we have bound the Holy Ghost yes you can yes I can yes we do yes we do okay so that don't exclude anybody let's just include everybody am Hey listen brother randam the Holy Ghost told him said don't you pray for that baby you going to make that right you lied old people hate for you to say something about a prophet but he was a human he went through things he listen all these people in the Old and New Testament went through things look at Paul Paul actually was having those Christians put into the prison and they were being killed Paul well Saul right so God used his flaws praise God brother BR said that's what made the Masterpiece perfect is the flaw right that's what Satan is not he's he's looking at us and he's going man I that I'm just making them I'm getting in their mind and I'm making them think these thoughts and some people are making them manifest I'm not talking about us I'm talking about ones in the world because listen these doctrines that come up that are false didn't come from God it can't come from God it had to come from a false teaching as brother R said misinterpreted theology from the pull pit sir that's why we have to be so careful here because that Spirit was not so much there in the first age there wasn't a denominational Spirit yeah there was a a saying there were some people that were saying things but now it wasn't a church on every corner that said Baptist I was reading the other day in the history I think brother ol gave me to it the history of the church first few hundred years of the church all churches until Constantine came in were churches that were of the that were of the day of Pentecost they believed in one God they believe water baptism name the Lord Jesus Christ they did the things they were supposed to do that was the churches that dominated that age but when Constantine come in and put Church in state together he started erecting bigger churches big old churches on each Corner big big old ideas that feels a lot better well we you know well yeah you ain't got to do this anymore this is a new way of doing it all right so the day of Pentecost on that group of people put them right there where it says brotherly kindness they had those virtues put inside of them by the Lord Jesus himself the three and a half years he preached to them and then what did they do they turned around and manifested it because what did Peter do Peter said add to your faith Right add to your faith virtue knowledge Temperance all the way but that wasn't never taught if you'll listen to brother Keith I don't know if he covered it all Sunday but no he didn't cuz we were sitting around a table me and him he said brother way you wouldn't believe the people that he is in contact with in these foreign countries where we've been for years ministering to them they don't even know what statute of perfect man is they think they got it all when they believed and they don't need that you know what they prove it that's right you will prove what you got or don't got but thank God that we've got somebody like brother Keith and different ones that can go over there and can sit down and have a minister meeting and and lay it all out and show them how the the seals is not just the white horse riders the Antichrist those seals are Jesus Christ and when that opens you see him and when that opens and you see him that's when the devil goes away from you right he can't stand truth he can't stand it he hates it just like God hates eror he hates truth God hates yeah I read you many times where God hates God hates that nickan Spirit he hates for a congregation to be conquered by a person God forbid that we ever do that have freedom to worship under the message of the hour all right everybody with me so that day of Pentecost was somewhat different from this one because this day of Pentecost fell on heart word because it wasn't time for it those people on the day of Pentecost isusa Street 1906 were trinitarians so you know God wasn't in that trinitarian Doctrine God wasn't in that water baptism in the name of Father Son and Holy Ghost all right but he was in the time that was allotted was the gifts the healing the speaking in tongues the shouting the screaming the prophesying but praise God that's what brother r came through and he stepped out of that with a healing campaign speaking in tongues but remember what he said he said you stayed right here he said God moved on right all right you ever stop you're behind cuz God never stops so everybody with me so far so that day of Pentecost now was a little different because it fell on sons of God that were tutored by Jesus himself this Holy Ghost fell on sons of God that had been tutored sometimes by false teaching hello that's just the way it is Luther had false teach if that's the word wetley had the same thing and so did param and and daddy Seymour but they had what they needed for the time the gifts had to come back into the church this this is part of the growing of the of the Corn and the shoot and the stalk and the tassel and remember now Pentecost was was the shook it looked like the grain but it was protecting it that's what it was doing it was protecting it from the devil hello somebody it was protecting it from the devil so that the grain which is me and you can come out again and then we're supposed to what lay in the presence of the Sun get rid of the shook hello get rid of the Shu get rid of that Pentecostal idea that they had that you got to speak in tongues and you got to shout and you're now full seed again and brother R says laying in the presence of the son s o n to ripen that's why the son of man was put in the grave here all right that's God in human flesh when I say son of man that's God walking around in human flesh all right that about with me word made flesh right well that's what's got to happen over here cuz that seed over here went in the ground it was Jesus Christ himself but he promised he promised he'd come back brother John he promised according to all Luke 17:30 and all the different ones that the son of man will be revealed again in human flesh but now a many membered body not just one right all members in particular all of us are part of that son of man Ministry now that's right amen all right I hope you see that it's not a different God it's a different dispensation it's a different attribute it's a different inm morphe he decided to in morphe in a bride and hide himself remember he said the world will see me no more but you who is you you is his bride not every Church on the corner his bride you his bride will be the son of man in the end time I'm coming with you and in you amen till the end of the world we ain't got to it yet but we're about that far from it all right everybody okay sir and it worked out with all the dominating female churches and that's what it is it's a domination I was looking the other day and I guess preaching on sin is costly must be cuz remember Joel ol said he didn't preach on sin that's right he makes 50 $4 million a year that's his salary that he set himself his salary $54 million a year lives in a 17,000 foot mansion and he's not the richest one Kenne Copeland is the richest one how they don't preach on sin I'll guarantee you if Joel Olstein tomorrow or Sunday got in the pull pit and said now I've heard from this man William brandham and you'd see that place scattered he wouldn't make 54 million he wouldn't make $54 his next check it ain't about money but you you see what that is he said I don't preach on sin what does he do he preaches on Sunshine and Roses this is not all sunshine and Roses I'll promise you that but the end result is what we're looking at and you got to be able to see it before you see it you got to believe to see remember instead of seeing to believe well if I could get just see a piece of that promised land no we've been told about it it's been sung about brother brandom went into it and come back and told us about it we've had others have experiences that maybe went in and told us come back and told about it we don't have to guess anymore like Brother Richard said about Dad he said he knew where to go when he broke from this Veil into the next one he wasn't lost that's why you call it lost right if you're lost L tonight and you die you don't know where you're going that's right you're a wering soul sorry but it's true we have an assurity that we know where to go that we're going when we have the new birth and have never been there before in our life but praise God he's let us see a little bit of it in our life through healings through our loved ones getting healed our loved ones getting saved our loved ones starting to come to church and different things I'm still praying for that all of us amen you got to well when they come in and they start sitting down I'll start believing well you're lost that's right cuz you don't know how to pray exactly but you pray as if they're sitting there that's right remember Abraham acted 25 years like he already had the baby remember brother rown said honey go get go buy the diapers go get the go get the uh the bird eyes and booty they don't know what that is but you know the little uh pins and the cloth diapers y'all don't know what that is some of y'all ain't never had any on but let's don't go there the opening of the first three seals oh hush well yours was paper I'm sure 70 years old opening of the first Hill it Loos a Ministry so that's what happened on the day of Pentecost what did Peter do on the day of Pentecost scared to death right but when he got the Holy Ghost something sparked inside of him and he stood he didn't he throw the doors open they weren't running out in the street like as drunk people they was they was drunk on the Holy Ghost maybe we ought to do that sometime if the Holy Ghost falls and gets inside of us it ought to anyway amen so it Loos the ministry and what first thing Peter said he started preaching he started preaching and then they said oh men and brotherr what wants me do he said repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins what loose the ministry to start and and it died come on it died in the church ages just like we were talking about it died in the Dark Ages you can't kill God but it had to go on the ground and die right to come back up to today you and I can we can look at the Shu we can look at the different things but we're grain amen we got to act different look different be different cuz remember the shuck does not go into the Garner the stock does not go into the Garner only the seed only the wheat seed the plant doesn't go in the wheat goes in the wheat's the most important thing now we are wheat plants amen that's right and praise God it loosed a Ministry and we're listening to it now we're listening where it was all shut up and then brother V comes and he says oh we got to get these seals open and then he preaches marriage and divorce he says oh thank God for the opening of these seals then he preaches serpent seed thank God for the opening of seals he was thanking God for what one thing opening the book up to where everybody could see what was going on he had to be able to partake of it first though but he could give it out to me and you and then here we are 60 something years later and that's what we're trying to do we're trying to get this message out the pure message out to the Believers so that you can believe amen right try try to believe try to believe that you're the bride even though you may be heading toward it you may be Sanctified but I'm bride I'm bride I'm bride read about it in the book He's our Lover he created all this just for us just for us he created everybody this just for us this whole world that I was looking yesterday and you look out over the horizon and and this Earth is so awesome now let's get started on this Earth but that ball we're on is so awesome brother John it takes 24 hours for it to turn around according to Time 24 hours to turn around and you know what it goes an hour and the sun's about right here and you go about another hour and the sun's about right here but that thing they say spending just like this to keep us on the earth and it's stuck stuck out in the middle of space there's nobody holding it up the word of God supp holding it up so if we can serve a God that can do that we can serve a God that can do a lot more for us so the first three ages a pure word of God the fourth age went in the ground just background already spoke on this so the son of man should be glorified now how is the son of man glorified in his people that's right father glorify us with the same Glory that we were glorified together before the foundation of the world except the corn of wheat fall on the ground and die to bide us alone but if it die bring forth much fruit till the fifth age we've been talking about it that's the age of justification justification I want to show you something here in just a minute it eradicates by faith in what Christ did at the cross the sins of your past nature all right is everybody with me on that you still are lost but your sins are gone your past sins that even right now Satan is like throwing them up like this he's a liar if you're if you're truly repentant God don't even see them have we got do we got yeah we got to believe that we got to believe past what our own mortal mind thinks cuz we can still remember but God can't I'll show you something just a minute and typ will prove that so being justified freely by by his grace through the Redemption in Christ Jesus to declare his righteousness for remissions of sins that are ped through the forbearance of God not through forbearance of us therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith without the Deeds of the law there was no law in the Old Testament that could justify you cuz it was still there your sins were only pushed toward Calvary if you were in the Old Testament they were pushed to Calvary and of course Calvary took care of of it but you were just covered it wasn't eradicated today when you get on your knees and say God forgive me of what I done he's just and the justifier he's the only one that can do it you can't do it yourself he's the only one trust in him when he said it's finished that finish your sin thank you Jesus there's only one sin you can be forgiven of and that's blasphemy and if you're still striving for God you haven't blasphemed if you blasphemed God it's like that girl said I can watch my mama's soul fry in hell and laugh at it that was crossing the line right that woman could never get back cuz remember she told Brother Brown that she wouldn't have her she wouldn't give her that religion to her dog or a cow or something right but you got a chance if you're still alive if you're still still striving for God still strive for God still say God forgive me we have to every day if you don't ask God to forgive you every day your sins is piling up and they stink they're really piling up I ask God to forgive me all the time I'm sorry I pray for me and sister pray for me she's like me too me too sister Alicia I do the same thing done dear I do the same thing I do it coming in that door and I do it coming in that coming out that door listen if you put it under the blood God don't see it you know what the prophet said even in discernment he couldn't discern it why cuz it's gone so you know what it's not in it's not in the mind of God anymore oh boy I just got that that's why he can't see it cuz listen it was the mind of God he was working through how can somebody know the doctor you saw had glasses in a blue coat on four days ago and that you were going to have a redheaded baby two years from now that wasn't a devil that was God and if God couldn't see it the the prophet couldn't see it just start believing that it's gone but the outer court is that justification but the outer Court look it's big it's a big place it's all in that outside but you did have to go to the laby you did have to kill the lamb everything was done out here God forgive me of my sins so I can go into the holy place not the holy of holies yet but the holy place I'll get back to a scene here in a minute but I just love the way that the church ages turns into Redemption cuz it's all Redemption every everything we preach of is in Redemption and actually everything we preach in is in threes three stages three PS three stages justification sanctification baptism Holy Ghost father son Holy Ghost right God's perfected in threes so guess what if God perfected in in threes so are you that's right all right everybody with me so now here's the picture of the outer Court this is the world nobody the these people out here do not care what's going on in here right unless they're coming in here to give a sacrifice they don't even care that's the world that's the 8 billion people that live out in the world but when you come through here and say God forgive me forgive me of this he's just to forgive you right there then he's got to clean you up keep cleaning you up to get you here remember justification is one act sanctification is the process right so the Philadelphian age was age of sanctification love of the Brethren it was also an age of what it had a little strength but it was also an unfulfilled age and he opened the door what he opened to the door to the great missionary age we'll skip through that we already been through it they opened up many doors the door of the Gospel the door of the mission field the door back to Christ and everything was opened up during that age but now remember there was a lap over of each age there was a lap over so the lap over of John Wesley went over into Pentecost that's why that param and them could look back and still believe in a father son Holy Ghost baptism and all the different fallacies that were there from from the reformers not a prophet that's why if they had had I don't say this lightly if they had any sense turn and look at the prophet look what God sent him he sent brother random just like just like brother Keith said God sent brother random in your language in your country there some of them people over there that it's a lot of what brother rown said is lost in interpretation but you got it right there where you need it that's why America is going to be burnt the first cuz we turned down a prophet the Pentecostals was looking right straight at their way out and they turned around in went in another direction right sorry but they did so sanctification is a cleaning up process and a set aside for use or purpose remember the glass process but as a process sanctification means becoming more holy Through Time John Wesley didn't just come on the scene and say clean up right now I'll be back next week no he preached 4,800 sermons that's right forever how many years he was alive just to get the people to see to be Sanctified so it's the process it's still he's still working on me Paul said I Die daily but Jesus said sanctify them through thy truth Thy word is truth the only way you can be Sanctified brother Ram tells us I didn't bring this quote but he tells us he says sanctification puts you in a religious order sanctification tells you you need to come to church sanctification needs you tell you to quit reading this and start reading this quit listen to this and start listening to that what that's shedding off the old you now even though you're born again let's go to the Statue of perfect man you're still shedding off the old you you got that Spirit realm that those demons are still scratching at the door everybody with me you're begotten of the spirit at sanctification look but you're never born of the spirit so when you enter into that second Veil you got an artificial light which is the candlesticks they have to keep lit so you have to listen to a Minister preach to you they make the shoe bread and they put the spices in the bowl they who the preachers but now remember when you go back in that holy of holies there's no moving Parts it's the ark with all that in it and you and God that's it amen so you're begotten of the spirit of sanctification but never born of the spirit until the Holy Ghost comes in now look a b got life in the womb little muscles are quivering it's a life but listen to what listen to the master physician but it's a different life when it breathes the Breath of Life in its nostrils it's different it becomes a living Soul it becomes a person my dear Methodist Brethren Pilgrim Holiness what what's he telling these people you're Sanctified you're living a good clean life listen they're the ones that wear the always wear the short I mean the long sleeves and no jewelry and and try to live the best they can under that under that age but God called us out of that age not to not to reverse and start doing the other but that plus that plus sanctification is the cleansing which is the preparation of life but when the Holy Ghost comes it is life preparation is cleaning the vessel today tomorrow yesterday two weeks ago two Sundays ago 14 Sundays ago God's trying to clean us up are we listening or we just sitting there looking like we don't know what we're doing we got to move but when the Holy Ghost comes his life preparation is cleaning the vessel the Holy Ghost is filling the vessel sanctification means clean and set aside for service the holy spirit is put in service you are the vessel that God's cleaned up you believe that amen now we'll notice when the unclean spirit is gone from a man's The Book of Luke he walks in dry places that's exactly what the church has done Baptist Methodist those who believed in sanctification then Jesus said the unclean spirit that went out returns back to his church body and finds the house garnished swept clean living Pure Clean lives all right but then if that house isn't filled or occupied then he comes in with seven other evil demons worse than he was and the last stage of this place is seven times worse than it was at the first place they had been better to stay Lutheran and it would to be received that light and failed to follow it so will the Pentecostal see you know what I mean the house is garnished what happened then when the enemy that went out under sanctification he they were washed out they returned back and found the house not filled with the Holy Spirit now the state of the church is joined with the league of churches the World Council of churches listen they all think they're right surprised no you shouldn't be they all think they're right why do they go to Baptist Church they think they're right why do you go to message church because we believe it's right but everybody's but everybody can't be right there's got to be a truth the truth not a Truth Listen Baptists have a truth methodists have a truth there's some of them that Liv way better lives than we do say to say but they don't have the Holy Ghost right to keep them cuz when something happens something blows up they go right back out in the world you see that happening in the church now in the message church now if you don't have the Holy Ghost you will leave here you can't stay here that's right you can't stay here under the power of the Holy Ghost and be Sanctified and just continue that for 20 years and not get filled with the Holy Ghost that's the foolish virgin y'all not know that a foolish virgin didn't get the Holy Ghost they got Justified and they got Sanctified but they got right here right to the curtain and something turned them back they turned their yourself back God didn't now remember we were talking about Christianity is not based on what people do do to you it's not based on conditions now this is sanctification that we need to start living well they it ain't concerned they now if Jesus was hanging on the cross what would he say brother John now they he said father forgive them for they know not what they're doing be honest be kind love your enemies bless them that curse you can we do that somebody flips you off going to down the road you say well Lord please just bless them they probably having a bad day no you get all riled up anyway we need work I am preaching preaching the front row BL nobody on the front row love your love your enemies bless them that curse you do good to them that hate you well they here we go again will they no it ain't they pray pray for them which despitefully use you and persecute you that you may be the children of your father which is in heaven for he maketh his son to rise on the evil and on the good and sendeth rain on the just and the unjust for if you love them that love you what reward have you now this is Jesus talking do not even the publicans do the same thing in other words people in the world there are people in the world that just are loving and they're good and they're kind but they're very few and if you salute your brethren only oh I like him because I like him and I that no under just I don't like him cuz they here we go again well they well they don't see it my way Jesus didn't say that Jesus said love them all be therefore perfect even as your father in Heaven which is imperfect now remember that word love is not filal love that is a gape God love because you can't fio love everybody in this world can't do it you humanly cannot do it somebody goingon to make you mad yep I just did so as I was speaking last night he's coming into the inner Court the veil is dropped he's heading heading into sanctification now the veil is dropped he lives daily for God meet him anywhere anytime he still got that testimony on his heart in any trial he still holds good it works friends I know by experience do you know by experience they both had the same Pastor they both read the same Bible now this's is talking about the people in the wilderness want you to listen to something right here real quick if you want to type this we're into sanctification but listen the children of Israel were what they were the people of God everybody with me that that was God's bride first that's righten loved them fell in love with them you can see right there Grace cuz they didn't like him complained all the time but remember what happened in their Journey they left Egypt the world Egypt's type of the world right so they left Egypt and the first thing they did they come up to the water and all the great one of the greatest quotes ever in the Bible besides it is finished and father forgive them is this quote right here in Exodus 14:13 Moses looks at his people they're scared to death here comes a Here Comes Pharaoh coming down the same same line I mean God kept the water back right till all the Army got in there but Moses turned around and he said look oh if we could just say this and get a revelation the enemy you see today you will see no more forever amen the enemy you see today you will never ever see that again that's why I said about justification that sin will never be brought up against you only God can do that he killed every Egyptian that was in that water and Israel's over there and marryam is having a Pentecostal Revival she's scouting and speaking in tongues and Moses sings about a two verse I mean a two chapter song read your Bible wouldn't that make you happy that for 400 years not 40 for 400 years those people coming down that aisle are coming down that place where God had pushed it they had beat them people for 400 years right and now God said that's enough I'm going to destroy is I'm going to destroy Egypt and then y'all going to go to the promised land what is our Promised Land the baptism of the Holy Ghost right so every Egyptian that beat them all the task Masters Masters all the ones that had that had I mean they beat them they whipped them made them work made them work double when they got mad everybody with me but Moses turned and he said that enemy that's been bothering you for 400 years now listen that didn't stop their enemy on this side right come on you had daythan cor you still had them standing in that congregation but that enemy that had been bothering you all your life it's gone and the Bible says you will not see them forever amen oh praise the Lord boy get a revelation from that and you might start shouting a little bit but what happened during the what happened now that was a event one day well actually happened two days one night the wind blew listen if you ever put your feet in a muddy in a in in a body of water I know y'all doing when y'all people like to go to the beach even the muddy late ler all that's mud right they mud this deep yeah that Red Sea was all underneath that was just this much mud never seen daylight ever and God in one night blew an East Wind in and made it where two million people plus Chariot plus their carts could go across that dry bed amen and never sink down one bit amen amen what a mighty God we serve and then he allowed your enemy to follow you through the same place thinking that they're going to kill you at the end of it and then all of a sudden Moses just holds his hand up with the rod he says that enemy you're not going to ever see him again and and then all of them were killed praise God all them demons that's been bothering us let's get rid of them let's not see them anymore oh they're going to try to see you oh yeah but remember that was an event that was justification but what happened is they were so full of their self they were so uh they were Jews you know two days later into the journey they're wanting to go back after they seen a nation destroyed after they seen their enemy destroyed a just like us two days later Well we'd rather go back up if we're going to die we'd rather die in Egypt than to Dr out here die here cuz they was doing without a little bit of water and then God gave them water then God gave them Mana what sanctification what happened during the 40-year journey the old demons died everybody with me right the old demons died the old Fighters all those old people died in the wilderness right remember brother brandham said Jesus said and they're everyone dead and that's interpreted eternally dead they didn't get to the promised land but they there was a new group come up that 40-year group of people got up to the brink and Joshua type of the Holy Ghost what did he do he took them over he took them over Moses didn't take him over right Moses stayed in sanctification come on somebody Joshua was the type of the Holy Ghost Moses wasn't Moses was the type of the believer that brought you up to it but there had to be somebody take you into the promised land there has to be somebody in this end time preach the new birth right preach that you must be justified you must be Sanctified you must have an experience of the baptism of the Holy Ghost for you to be bride if not are we dying in the wilderness are we being are we are we are we letting the ones that bother us die in the wilderness I'm talking about the demons that bother us the anybody with me I've seen people shout you seen people shout that lived any kind of Life seen people danc in the spirit up and down the hall listen Maran boy she's she put on a show tambourine for hours speaking in tongues and and praising God up and down that aisle but remember it wasn't but about two or three years later she she didn't curse Moses but she said you're not who you think you are what' God do he struck her with Leprosy and she died in the wilderness Aaron died in the wilderness that's I've seen both men and women do that seen men and women dance in the spirit speak with tongu shout had a temper like I don't know what there's something wrong there's something wrong if you can't hold the blessings of God doesn't matter what happens doesn't matter what goes on if you you can lift your hands and say God you're in control yes amen God is in control we we want to control things ourself hello somebody Moses got they Aaron got in trouble trying to control things itself remember when Moses was gone Aaron just gets this Revelation that he can take a calf and then lie to Moses and say that thing just jumped out of the fire Moses brother brother I mean that just that thing just jumped right out of the fire what' Moses do Moses had a little bit of a temper Moses said cook that thing down to ashes put it in your water and you're going to drink it hello put in that water and you going to drink that thing it jumped out of there and you started worshiping it our God's a good God but he's a god with a line when he draws a line there's no going AC cross it we already talked about sanctification so the Tabernacle and the shoe bread and the candlesticks is all in sanctification all right everybody with me and then remember the Israelites made that they made the shoe bread listen nobody made the Mana what's a Mana a Mana is a type of the Holy Ghost right nobody made that I was looking at a watching a commentary today there was some people some Jewish people were trying to find out the components of that Mana it was so good they didn't even need water they didn't need anything but that one little thing what about a vitamin I take a I take a handful they won't even fit in that cup a day to try to keep myself a little bit healthy it ain't working much but praise the Lord I don't know that it wouldn't if I don't take them but they pick that man up every day that fell from heaven there was nothing cooked they didn't cook it the priest didn't cook cook it Moses didn't cook it listen Moses didn't even say God we need Mana God just said here's Mana but now remember when the people get this when the people asked for something when they started loathing that Holy Ghost that was falling on them God sent them Quail but while the meat was in their teeth he sent serpents to kill them all stick with Mana that's right stick with Mana folks stick with the Holy Ghost amen stick with what God give us the Israelites made it in the form of an obong cake thick as your thumb large as a plate but it was consecrated to the Lord at the Lord's table so man made that and then man made it man had to deliver it that's why we need a five-fold Ministry we need a five-fold Ministry to get us into the holy of holies everybody with me that's why that second that's why that veil was there to keep us separated all right let's continue on let's get to something we'll quit right here we know what the shoe bread was we know what everybody knows what the Tabernacle was the type of it's type of me and you the outer Court like I said before the outer art there was a whole bunch of people there's a lot of people going to be justified cuz all you got to do is ask God truly ask God to forgive you of your past and he'll forgive you Millions upon millions of people would do that but the next part gets a little more tough right not as many people gets to go back there because you got to clean your life up before you go then when you go into the holy of holies it really sheds them off only one person goes in that's you and God for there was a tabernacle made the first wherein was the Candlestick the table the shoe bread which is called the sanctuary and after the second Veil The Tabernacle which is called the holiest of all that's what we're getting to the holiest of all which will be the baptism of the Holy Ghost which had the golden censor Ark of the Covenant overlaid with gold was the pot that had Mana in it that God made and it never got bad wow how about that and then Aaron's Rod that budded and the two tables the word of God that come from the mountain were SL were set in slots inside of that one little box if you want to see what's in it we got one right over there in the study that's a small miniature version of it and Aaron's Rod that budded and produced almonds in just a record number of time and it wasn't even put in the ground so let's look at this just for a second we'll close Luke 24: 49 said behold I send the promise of my father upon you but tar ye in the city of Jerusalem until you be endued that word ude me sunk into that Pillar of Fire didn't stay on top of their head it went down into them amen all right you can have the pillar of fire on top of your head every day of your life and die and go to hell hello andin know what the prophet of God said but once it gets in you and burns that old you up that old nature not your soul he God don't kill your soul CU he'd be killing you but the nature that's attached to that he kills he's the only one that can do it amen you can't do it right but until you be endued with power from on high Mark 15:37 Jesus cried with a loud voice and gave up The Ghost and the veil of the temple was rent and Twain From the top to the bottom they don't know what to do with you when you get born again cuz God rined the veil and exposes it you to the world and it was God because that thing's 20 or 30 something feet tall it started at the top and was rent from the top to the bottom only God could do that and I promise you they were some clamoring around you're not supposed to be able to see the thing they were trying to close it backwards probably cuz if you looked at it you died right but if they' have looked out the window like brother R said if they' looked out the window at Calvary they'd see that that veil was rent there right proven that that veil was no that Tabernacle was no more the holy of holies it was in a group of people God tore us apart I like that song you wash my eyes with tears I hope uh sister Anna mcfar used to sing that and it brought tears to my eyes he washed my eyes with tears that I might see the beauty of himself what revealed in me he tore it all apart and looked inside and saw somebody with a lot of Foolish Pride I love that song acts Tuesday when the day of Pentecost was fully come so now we're going to get into the that was that was that old Pentecost we're going to get in the new Pentecost just for a second then we'll close and suddenly there came a sound from Heaven as a as a as of a rushing Mighty Wind it filled all the house where they were sitting there appeared on them clothing tongues like as fire and it sat upon each one of them and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost and began to speak with other tongues as the spirit gave them utterance now the spokesman for Pentecost was Peter not the messenger everybody with me Peter was not a prophet Peter was a messenger a spokesperson all right he wasn't the messenger spokesperson all right Bishop param was over here cuz watch what brother R says questions and answers on the seals you see each one of these ages only took a dip into the Holy Spirit now listen that didn't mean they didn't get it they got the Holy Spirit right every age had bride and bride Somebody went in the holy of holies that was bride in those ages with the word that they had that's right that with me but remember it was a portion it was a dip it was a piece it was reforming people justification is a work of the Holy Spirit sanctification is a work of the Holy Spirit but the baptism is the holy spirit that's the reason it took a prophetic Prophet to come down he's talking about himself then he says no messenger what to the age of Pentecost everybody with Meen no Messenger to the age what a spokesperson a spokes people param uh daddy Seymour read about isusa Street powerful group of people and they were they were black just tore the place apart no mess to the age because the Holy Ghost came himself in the fullness of the baptism so on the isusa street in 1906 if you'll see they were building up and it's kind of like that I want us to see here too I was talking to brother Keith this past weekend there's something there's not something holding this church back but there's something that we're going to have to step up too we got the word the word in tape and book form brother Dale was preached it for 50 Years everybody with me I can't preach it no different we just got to get it living inside of us living moving breathing instrumentality of God to where we can worship the way we need to worship and supposed to worship and there's no restrictions on worship there's no time restraint on worship I'm not saying there's nothing wrong I'm just saying if if this is a new season and this is a new time then we need to not have a new mentality we just have to have a spark of what we already have listen folks we're not going we can't go out there and get something else if you if you find it let's go get it everybody with me if you if you can find it we'll go get it it's been preached here we just got to live it amen and then what we got to do we got to live it then what we got to do we got to show it amen and it's happening okay is everybody with me no Messengers to the age because the Holy Ghost came himself in other words Peter with a spokesperson cuz they asked him said men and Brethren what must we do he said repent be baptized all right but now later on here comes Paul Paul gets converted he meets Peter they're preaching the same thing and they hadn't seen each other for years they're preaching the same thing now how can that be they both had his holy ghost the same Holy Ghost now why can't we get together in the end time I'm fixing to say something here why can't we get together in theend time and have the same have the same not views like brother Dell always said what's your input no they should be able to get together just like I have never you know like brother George Quinn if I never met him and he comes here and sits down and we talk we'll be able to talk about the same thing we're going to have a Minister's meet here in September we ain't had one in several years pray for us 20 people 20 ideas which shouldn't be that way we should be in unity but what do we do we let emotion and feelings we let our own emotions and feelings get involved and there's one thing brother Dell told us to do with those right P them up put them in your back pocket and sit down on them what what you say am and how much we do that no we don't we change a little something or something happens and we're like I don't like that but they no I'm just kidding but at the end of the age now watch as it always ends up upon the other yeah we find there see the messenger sent param was not the messenger to that age he was a spokesperson cuz brother R says specifically the Holy Ghost came himself and pour out the holy ghost on a group of people in isua California from A to Z in the USA that's what isua means and then it what it spread all over the United States and then it went across the the over into the other countries so it was the Holy Ghost working in a group of people but what were they doing they were still working in that come on bondage they were working in bondage but when brother brandham come they should have come out of those shackles and come out of that bondage but they stayed right in there and said no this is it right brother Brown said you think you got it all you ain't got started yet I bet they loved him saying that but remember but the End of the Age so at the end of the Pentecostal age here comes the prophet the messenger the person the number seven the messenger there's no eight Messengers it's eight manifestations of the Holy Ghost but only seven Messengers cuz that's what the Bible says but at the end of the age as it always ends up on the other we find then the messenger sent look because he identifies and all these Scruples are to be placed in their places that didn't happen at Pentecost they just got the gifts they were stored the gifts they still had what loose sins brother R said they still had baptism wrong they still had trinitarian ideas so brother randam had to come the messenger come at the end of the what Pentecostal age and all these Scruples and things are to be placed in their places like that then the Rapture comes for the church but as many is allotted all these different things the sun turned to Darkness to Moon they put that way back there in the Christian age they just fail to see them three questions was asked of Our Lord when he answered them he was talking about it's coming true right then cuz remember the three questions they asked him was right before the seals in Matthew 24 Jesus preached the seals brother R didn't preach the seals first man don't do things first God does things first Jesus preached the seals in Matthew 24 preached six seals and he was the seventh standing right there so brother brandom had to come and preach those seals Christ preached them through him that's why the Mighty angel had to come down and then he had to speak but in the days of the voice so who gets it in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he begins to sound the mystery let's stand our feet the mystery you're the mystery the mystery of God should be finished the Alpha and Omega has come together we've made it we're here we're at the end we're going to start talking talking about some of the major doctrines cuz remember we're going to spend a little bit of time on the first part of brother Brown's Ministry which was what tying up the Loose Ends starting a healing campaign the healing campaign was what the bait on the hook it was not the hook it was the bait on the hook right brother John it was the bait on the hook wasn't wasn't the bait's what the bait is what attracts the fish but what catches the fish is the hook you put bait on the end of a stick and throw it out there end of a rope and they'll just eat didn't go on but you put a good hook inside that they ain't going nowhere so what' he do he hooked me and you he caught where those fish that he caught people in the vision of the third pole where the fish where the fish that he caught amen right because of the healing campaign the the word comes in manifestation and in power and puts it all back together again and that's where we stand today God bless you let's sing a song at night I lay in bed and I begin to cry and my mind just fail to know exactly why I can explain with tongue or the spirit gring deep within it must be gone here in my soul cuz I feel the PO we ought to be able to feel it I feel cuz that's what we that's what we're here for I hear the call I know his Spirit moving me to give my all he speak to me thank you Lord and ie do you agree with it Lord please come and take control I feel the I to hear the word what now and with each do we hang on every word that a preacher preaches or somebody tells us or listening to a tape do we hang on every word or do we just listen and let it be just background noise there's a call to the Deep like a great magnet ping me I know for sure that I'll reach the goal cuz I feel the pool worship him I feel the PO oh there's got to be something tugging at your heart there's got to be something leading you and guiding you all through your day I know his Spirit moving me to give my all he speak to me and I agree don't miss that voice oh Lord please come and take control I feel feel the PO I feel the PO do you feel that little tug I hear the call he called your name I know his Spirit moving me to give my all he speak to me and I aree Lord please come and take control I feel the PO he love the Lord look at that over the back of that door when you when you go out the door turn around and look have you give you all for Jesus Christ we give our all for our job we give her all for this we give her all for that do we ever just say God I'm giving this all for you I had don't know I had a coach he he told us he said that's the one the same one that said lead follow get out of the way but he said if you've laid everything out and we have to drag you off the field he said you've give your all he said don't leave don't leave nothing give it all and he said I'll be happy if we get beat 50 to nothing he said if you'll give everything you got out there on that field and don't leave don't leave anything don't God don't need a reserve tank he don't have one he don't need a reserve tank so you don't need one either well I just think if I don't wor if I worship now I I won't have enough to worship tomorrow well you need to get the new birth there's plenty to worship with there's plenty to thank God for there's plenty to look at even in the morning when you get up and say God thank you there's a lot of people didn't make tomorrow a lot like millions in the world that die every day in the morning there'll be something happen somebody won't make it but if you made it you know what he's done he's got a purpose for you he's got a purpose for you that day you've got a purpose if you made it to that day if you'll start looking that like that maybe we'll grow a little bit more that God purposed everything amen what the footsteps of the righteous are ordered of the devil no they're ordered of my boss no they're ordered of the Lord so every step you take brother John God I'm going to make this one for you brother Lise God I'm going to make this one for you brother Terence God I'm
