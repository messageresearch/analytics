prophet said if you don't understand this come back to this book here people he was talking about the seals come back to christ's christ and mr god revealed and i think it took me a long time to get it i probably read that christ mr guard reel at least seven times trying to get a revelation because the education wasn't bringing it to me right i mean i i just we just had to keep holding on to it

of iniquity flourish it is that they shall be destroyed forever for low thine enemy oh lord for low thine enemies shall perish all the works of iniquity shall be scattered man eyes also shall see the

clapping praise while we're standing i want to thank everybody for last weekend thank you for all the food all the all the time that was put in and all the uh everything that was done you a lot of you opened your homes up for the for the group in ohio and they sure felt at home and that's the way we want them to feel amen and also the ministers i've talked to all three of them actually again since that time and they really really appreciated the services and the time being here and having a good time in the lord so thank you again for everything you did amen yeah yeah the lord the lord the lord will uh he'll have his way one way or the other he'll have his way don't worry about that also the group in ohio wanted me to tell you today that they have come up with a name for the little group that they're at their uh meeting there this morning at uh in uh brother isaac's basement some of you most of you saw the pictures of it um but they're going to be now called the lighthouse of refuge the lighthouse of refuge the reason they did that is is they're going to have a church it is a church they are watching us online but we are praying that they'll that they'll um uh get them a pastor or somebody will raise up uh god to raise somebody up in in that group but as for now they call us their home church and the ministry here is what they listen to and i wish that they would uh i wish that they would uh be able to tell you and you know it's not bragging on them but man they just they comment so much about the services and i wonder how many of you went back and listened to what services when you weren't here obviously you don't because when we make announcements it's like a surprise to you so that's a attaboy to them but you know what when the words me and brother bible talk about just a few minutes ago when the word of god is the foremost thing in your life and receiving that word of god and trying to grow up the statue of perfect man that's what will happen to you if you lollygag around and diddle around and just you know come to church and you don't ever pay attention and and uh you sleep half the time then it's like brother bob said one day you're going to wake up and the rapture is going to take place have already took place hey man brother brown said you know he said that still small voice will say you missed it don't waste our time we'll talk about that today about the children of israel but the lighthouse of refuge is the name of the church and they are they are a full-fledged part of our church at the moment now their tithing comes here i just want to you know tell you that they are a part of the church they're not separated only but my by miles all right and we love them all and um just fell in love with them and i think they kind of fell in love with us too but they'll be called the lighthouse of refuge and they are i think they are either getting or becoming a 501 3c nonprofit corporation so our organization so they can be set up and ready to go but we sure love them and i know they're watching in now and we love them with the love of the lord and we're going to try to go up there in july i'll talk about that in a minute but let's hurry through this remember that june is going to do a canning class sometime this summer and if you all want to sign up i think sister roots already signed up some of you want to do it we're going to do it here and we're going to do a few items like green beans or something like that and show you how to can so in case we need to eat and we don't have to worry about the food chain all right yeah don't have to worry about the food chain all right also remember brother aaron will be speaking for us wednesday coming up wednesday uh next not this coming but next weekend may 7th will be the bible study we're still speaking on a little bit of the rapture and then we'll move on into the millennium that will be from six to eight o'clock and we'll also set up the zoom meeting for the for the brothers and sisters in ohio um may the eighth brother jewel fourny has asked me ten times to come preach for him so on may the eighth i know that's mother's day but i'll be at brother jewel fournie's church that weekend uh brother luis will be at brother duchess church that weekend and brother aaron will be doing the morning service and brother bob will be doing the afternoon service so i made bob he has to do two things sunday school and preaching yeah how about that i can do that because i because i run this out up here this little just right here i'm the scheduler all right so remember now to may the 21st brother key dre diggs will be here at three o'clock on that saturday we'll only have one service on that sunday and then there'll be a fishing trip oh we need to have a sign up sheet do we need to sign up so you need to take them no just show up just show up june the 18th the fishing trip at uh brother terrance and zach's pond over in banks county we'll give you the address and we'll have a day of fishing and uh we will have hamburgers and hot dogs and that'll just be for the men and the and the boys all right no no gerald's allowed that's what zach always would say no journals allowed when he was growing up so also remember july 3rd brother chris long will be here two services and we'll have a meal and then also remember tentatively july the 23rd tentatively there'll be a youth meeting in ohio we need to know now who wants to go there's a sign up sheet down at the uh downstairs on the refrigerator if you want to go put your name down because um if we get enough people to go brother dale said we could probably charter a bus or get some way to go where you all won't have to drive but that's remember that's tentative that's in july though so i know most of you won't remember that but we're going to keep announcing it and then brother joe will put it on the screen and also put it on the website after today after the second service after second service there'll be a birthday party continuation for brother dale if you brought him any gifts he give them to him today and also uh brother richard roberts my wonderful brother-in-law asked terence about that um he will be he was 50 the other day and we're gonna have cake and ice cream for him let me explain something to you though real quick because it needs to be now if you have a birthday all right if you have a birthday and want to give that person a birthday party that's fine you pay that for the ice cream and you pay for the cake and all the happy birthday things all right now brother dale is different sister dale is different then mama and papa the church and they they run the place so let they get a birthday party for free amen but now you don't but if you have one that's not a problem we had a problem with this a long time ago some people left the church because we didn't give a birthday party to a certain person and and the church pay for it well we ain't we ain't in the birthday business we'll sing happy birthday to you okay but if you want to have a birthday party and fine have it anytime you want to at the church use the facilities but you pay for the food and you pay for the cake and and all that stuff and that's fine and that's the way it is with with a lot of other stuff that we do just make sure that you don't get you know you didn't get all get convoluted that well why are we giving this one one and not given that well it's not the church giving anybody a party except brother dale sister dale that's the only parties that the church gives everybody got that okay everybody else i know you all have birthdays it's obvious you're still here so if you want to have one though that's fine you can have it downstairs and we can announce it just like today with with um richard that we'll have the 50th birthday party downstairs for cake and ice cream supplied by the robbers family so just want to make sure that we know that and also one more thing when we're singing happy birthday we sing happy birthday generically to everybody in the month everybody got that all right but if your birthday falls on the day we're having service and you come to this church now they see a few of them birthday things on that list that you people don't ever showed up hardly you ain't getting a birthday song because you don't come to church half the time that's hard to say to a message church but it's true but my mama's so gracious to put everybody that says they claim this is their church to put down that they go to this church she announces their birthday but if you're not here thank you regina if you're not here then you don't get sung but if you're here and it's exactly your birthday we sing happy birthday to you so i'm just wanting to make an informed group is a better group when they're informed that that we don't have any secrets so let's go to john 1 1. god bless you thank you again last last weekend was tough on everybody but i don't think we'd have a three-day meeting in a while but it was wonderful what you all did and all the service and everything everybody did oh no doubt we're proud of the attendance yeah we had a packed house they were over 100 each service so that was that was really good so thank you all for attending and coming and we appreciate what you did and uh if you didn't get to come this prayer would be good amen so let's go to john 1 verse 1. and i told bob i said i'm gonna i'm going to reign on his parade a little bit because i'm going into hebrews and we're gonna i got to read in hebrews yesterday or the past four days and i'm telling you it's full of some good stuff and it really if you'll if you're we're going to pull it out today that it talks about adoption it talks about your furtherance in the gospel you know and leaving the principles of the doctrine of christ let us go on to perfection all right so let's go in to john 1 1 first let's remember all the ones that are not here brother joe and sister rachel are on vacation and brother john duretz he on his way back or is he still over there you heard that from his lovely wife okay we're going to pray that he don't have coven because he'll have to have a test he'll have to stay there if he doesn't right two more days so let's just pray that ten more days that's right i thought it would be almost a week so let's just pray that that thing won't happen to brother john we can get him back home okay all right let's bow our heads dear lord thank you for this day thank you for the people that are standing in front of me lord and the ones online lord they're the greatest people on the face of the earth wouldn't want to gather with another group of people lord now i pray lord that you'd speak to us today is the time that we come to hear from you lord not from one certain person but to hear from you lord may we have the mind of christ that we can speak to your people father and then then they have the mind of christ to receive it lord in in in as brother brown says that we're supernatural people we're a prophetic people may they receive it in a prophetic way and lord may they receive it in a prophetic way today lord they'll see that this bible is talking about them and lord it will take lord your name today the name of the lord jesus christ and magnify it in front of the people that you behind lifted up and all things will be put under your feet lord as we'll read here in just a little bit father thank you for coming and dying for us thank you for doing the things that you do as the son of man lord as you came down here and you toiled and you worked and you did the things of life lord but you're god almighty that created all things and we thank you for that lord it humbles us to know that there was a god that didn't need us but we need you but you decided to need us and you put us in your plan father just be with the ones that are sick sister freedom different ones lord we pray that you just bless them give them a special touch today in the name of the lord jesus we pray amen remember sister rebecca atkins she's having her surgery on her on her left hand one day this week yeah wednesday all right john 1 verse 1. in the beginning was the word words with god and the word was god the word was made flesh and dwelt among us we beheld the glory of the glory the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth you may be seated in the lord as blessing to the reading of the word we're going to read romans 8 verse 18. i was talking to brother brother mike oltek we were talking sunday afternoon and oh no sunday morning in the study and he said man i sure am enjoying that um son of man series he said but when i looked down and saw you was at part 30 he said i was didn't want to listen to every one of them he said can you give me another condensed version so i give him a few extras because a lot of it's fill in and you understand what i mean a lot of it you have to background because there's people here that are new and and all that so i told him just to be patient i'd get finished here in just a little bit we're on part 31 today but i love the son of man i mean it's what we're supposed to be that's what we're supposed to be focused on it's like i'm gonna read you here in a minute you know somebody's horn's honking in the outside whose car is it can you go look and see if you don't mind somebody all right now i'll continue honking in here romans eight are we out of yeah i hear it now are we out of a screen here we don't have no blue skirt we got blue screen maybe they're working on it so romans 8 verse 18 because i need it up for what we're going to do in the book of hebrews for i reckon that the suffering of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us not in paper and pencil and trees and cars that are honking it's going to be revealed in people all right for the earnest expectation of the creature our creation waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of god and remember we've been talking about being predestinated to adoption so we've been predestinated to something there's people that have been predestinated to eternal life these people been predestinated to damnation but it was because of what god saw in his mind before the foundation of the world everybody all right with that all right hey i heard a lot of amens last weekend i don't want to bring new preachers in here every weekend just to get you all saying man thank you sister at least she got a revelation but we're predestinated to adoption and that's our call our call is to be adopted in this time not that not to just not to just even go up the statue of a perfect man and if they will in a few minutes we're going to pull that chart back up but let me read number one i've read this before but i'm going to read it again brother brown says teaching places of man positionally what he is and as as brother bob and different ones have been talking about you got to know where you're at you got to know what you're doing with god you can't be sure you can you can you need to be at rest but now that doesn't mean stay at home right you need to be at rest in what in your person your person needs your soul needs to be at rest but listen god never has rested as man says rest we think of rest as going sitting under a tree with our arms folded our legs folded kick back in a hammock and take a nap which sounds pretty good but that's not what god does god's moving that's why you see the people at the whaling mall even even the israelites now they know god the jews they know god moves so they when they're praying they're moving they're always constantly moving and so is god and listen he's not required to go back and pick us up but he does that's called grace but he's not required to and one day he's going to move on and we're going to have to move on with him because remember he said i'll not always strive with man there's a lot of things god tells you that when he gets done telling you if you don't do it you're in big trouble we're all in big trouble all right so teaching places of man positionally what he is now listen we want to know why do we come to church we come to church to know who we are you say oh brother we're bride it's deeper than that there's things that go with it there's things that go with that we are the bride of jesus christ sure but what is the bride supposed to do we're supposed to be him made manifest in another form called the bride so teaching positionally places what he is and we can never rightly be able to have faith everybody's wanting to have faith well here's what the prophet everybody believed brother brown was the prophet all right okay brother brown said you never rightly you can never rightly be able to have faith until positionally we know what we are all right we got to know what we are not what we're going to be we listen the bible tells us what we're going to be we're going we're the bride of jesus christ we're going to live in heaven with him we're going to be eternal people but there's a journey in there we just don't skip from one to the other you don't skip from kindergarten to college it doesn't happen all right so now let's go to number two and let's just read this real quick brother ryan says your adoption is not your birth so we we pulled it apart there's two different things that we're looking at here your adoption is not your birth your adoption is your placing you were born again and we'll look at this in in hebrews i was looking at a couple days ago and i thought man this is good so we're going to go through if you got your bible go and turn to hebrews chapter 2 and we'll get to that in just a second because i want you to read along with me besides on the screen if you don't mind but when you're born of the spirit of god you're son of god but you were predestinated but you were predestinated now here's what i'm trying to get you to for the sons of the last day everybody with me we were predestinated unto adoption and there's three stages of adoption the first stage is what getting born again the first stage is if you could pull that chart up please the first stage is the birth romans 8 verse 14 says for as many as are led by the spirit of god they are the sons of god for we have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but we have received a spirit of adoption whereby we cry have a father so we're babies we all begin as newborn babies in christ we know that the spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit that we are the children of god if your spirit contrary to god today you are not a child of god but you can be but you can be there's an open door there's there's a facility called the bible and the new birth and the teachers of the message and and listening to what god says to you yeah that'll get you in and if children then heirs heirs of god and joined heirs with christ now of what heirs of what well well you know jude's mother passed away and she's the heir she's the heir to to the the property and and come to find out grandma didn't or jackie didn't own nothing what are you heir of but now she knows she's the heir of two homes which one's already sold and pray the other one does but all that she's heir to that because there's something there so in the same way with jesus christ you can't just say well i'm an heir of god and then you don't come to church you don't read your bible you understand what i'm saying you're not going to get an inherit yeah you're going to inheritance but it ain't going to be a good one all right i'm just telling you i want to read where paul tells us we need to we need to be gone from those early principles of and we know we got new ones and we know that there's uh uh needs to be a repentance and baptism we know that we had four baptized last weekend so thank god for that amen and if children then heirs heirs of god and joint heirs with christ whatever christ has got we're going to get all right so what has he got the whole bible genesis to revelations is ours all right and what lays in that well we just keep trying to tell you about it amen god keeps trying to tell us about it but today we're and if children didn't heirs now watch and join us with christ if so be that we just lollygag around with him and and it's all right if we don't do this that's not what it said it says suffer with him and we're going to talk about that a little bit in hebrews paul was one that knew about suffering paul knew he was beat with stripes three times i believe it was 39 or 40 minus one he was stoned almost killed he knowed what suffering was about all right that we may also what be glorified together i was thinking the other day you look at all these this junk in the world and they're glorifying this and they're glorifying that now they're glorifying whatever gender you want to be they're glorifying whatever you want to have a change if you don't like being a girl you can be a boy if you need to that'd be all right it's okay well not to god and not to you and me as christians we're going to be glorified together with jesus christ or whatever he gets we get whatever glorification he gets we get that's why those he has justified he has already glorified because we're glorified in who in christ everybody all right so i want you to listen to this i'm gonna read this little quote they don't have it back there but if you'll pull the uh the little uh adoptions the one that bob did one with the three three play three stages on the pyramid we'll talk about that just for a second real quick because peter tells us in second peter one he says this is another one that knows about statue of a perfect man he's a he's a liar and he was he cursed and cut somebody's ear off and said i'll just kill every one of you leave my lord alone don't wash my feet lord none of that to them that have obtained like precious faith with us through the righteousness of god and our savior jesus christ and said beside this giving all diligence add are we having problems back there they're not getting this stuff on the screen we just used it two weeks ago bob if you can go help him because it was on the screen and was on the thing a couple weeks ago we used it so anyway so remember there's three stages of adoption so let's just let's just imagine what we got all this imagination let's just imagine that we've got a pyramid right here we'll just use this one all right at faith you receive the new birth is that right all right at faith i i somebody sent me a link to a preacher in the message that a lot of you know that's preaching now that you got to have you got to get all these virtues a piece of these a piece that you get part of the whole i don't know how you underst i can't understand listen it's like dad said to preach the truth just listen to what truth is same way with daniel 70 weeks what is truth truth's in the bible truth's in the bible peter says right here simon peter a servant apostle jesus christ to them that have obtained like precious faith with us through the righteousness of god and besides this besides this new birth giving all diligence add to your faith verse your knowledge temperance so we're going to look justification sanitation baptism of the holy ghost everybody got that you don't have to wait up here this is a special anointing of the holy ghost but it's not the new birth everybody with me because peter is talking about like precious faith if peter was born again we gonna be like peter and obviously he was cause he was one of the 120 in the upper room and you know what a preacher didn't have to tell him the bible told me that the holy ghost fell on 120 in the upper room and they got the holy ghost they got the new birth so there's no there's no qualms of peter ever how he acted in his previous life he's got the new birth and he's writing the bible i can't understand why people don't believe people and it's written in the bible plain as day he said beside this giving all diligence add what add to your faith virtue you verse your knowledge knowledge temperance and prescription godliness brother kindness and then love and then brother branham thank god he sent us a prophet that told us what this was he said that's what seals everything together that's what seals all these virtues together because listen we are not a loose group of people tossed about by every wind of doctrine sleight of man silly women led away and that's that's talking about church silly women right women bride churches this led away by every little doctrine this away and every little doctrine this way we are not caught up in that we're supposed to be on a firm foundation we're not supposed to be if the wind blows this away we just go that way if if somebody wants to preach this and and and he gets a long prayer line and and you feel good and you start crying that don't mean one thing to me let me listen to what he's got to say let me listen to the word first give me the word first because you know what satan's going to do in the end time false anointed ones they're anointed with the true holy ghost but it's not on the word that they preach it's an emotion it's in the spirit realm memory reason conscious affects the imagination it's in that realm it's not in the soul thank you [Applause] and i thank god bob did that bob did this not too long ago and i really appreciate it y'all can see we're gonna look at this one so you see this so this is the new birth but at the new birth does that finish what you're looking at no it begins what you're working on it begins your faith and then now look brother brown said you can't he didn't say you couldn't have faith he said you rightly can't have faith without look watch and we can never rightly be able to have faith until positionally we know what we are so now right now we know that we're a son of god amen we're son and daughter of god right here listen israel was israel in egypt so we're going to get to that in a minute israel didn't become israel they were the children of god to begin with and they had a covenant we'll talk about that we'll talk about immutability if we get to it if we don't we will this afternoon those of you that get those notes use them tonight because i'm going to stop at a certain place and then we'll re restart this afternoon so justification thanks question the new birth puts you in the body of christ listen you can't have virtue you can't have godly virtue and not have the new birth what's it going to draw from so there's no way you have to wait till you get up here to get the holy spirit no you get the new birth now look the new birth and the holy spirit's two different things remember hello somebody brother brown said you can have the holy ghost every day of your life on your spirit realm and die and go to hell but you can't have the new birth and die and go to hell he said you mean they're different they're different but they're the same it's the position you put them in everybody with me say amen so this is not a new new birth once you get born again you're sealed as i said before the caps put on whatever's inside is going to stay in there but you can decide though whether this what does sanctification mean clean and set aside for service now you've already been clean down here but i die daily paul says there's things that brother bible is talking about circumcision different things it's got to be it's got to be shed off and when when joshua came to go into the promised land to positionally place the the children of israel what do you have to do he had to circumcise the one he didn't re-circumcise himself everybody got that he did not have to him and caleb you didn't have to re-circumcise them they were already circumcised everybody with me but the ones that grew up in the message in the journey had to be circumcised all right so they come to a position that you have to be circumcised you have to be circumcised to get in the land this is your land this is your property this is your heirs and joint heirs you're an heir of that and it took a profit to put it all together and show us look this is yours now what the prophet of god say he said now i'm going to present that though to god so somewhere somebody's got to be that for brother brown to present that to god remember the people when he went across the curtain of time said you'll go back so we'll come back and we'll be judged by what you say and we'll be presented before god and this one brother brown said well did paul make it and i said yeah he said well praise god i'll make it because he's preaching the same gospel but they say he was false pitiful people i'm telling you blind wretched miserable naked and don't know it and we're going to read about it a little bit in hebrews but everybody all right we're right here we have to have the new birth before god can quicken or make alive anything else in our life because what are you going to quicken it with man people we were dead we were dead in sin and then we gonna have to go up all the way there before we get the holy spirit man's intelligence will tell you that man's wisdom will tell you that but god's wisdom will not tell you that god's intelligence will not tell you that but we have to come to a new birth you have to come to a justified sanctified state filled with the baptism of the holy ghost do like the four did last week get baptized no get the foundation right to start with repent and be baptized in the name of jesus christ for your mission and your sins and you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost what a promise and we know how to become baptized so you know what god had to you hear me now you repent you get baptized in the name of jesus christ rightly god's got to give you the holy ghost god's got to give you the holy ghost you say god can do anything he wants to god cannot do what his word said he couldn't do or could do right he only can do the word says repent be baptized in the name of jesus christ for your mission and you see him and you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost for this promise see that's why i see um immutability we'll talk about it later on maybe even tonight is the way it's going now immutability of his counsel he can't change can't change at all but the connection is though is the immutability of me and you oh you went too far no the problem with adam was is he didn't have he wasn't immutable he changed so do all of us we've made changes in our life the 15 minutes ago we may have we made a change god has never changed but god said if you eat of this you're going to die if you don't eat it you're going to live all right he made the covenant but it was conditional adam broke the covenant now we'll get into it later on where god made a covenant with abraham and said i will abraham i don't care if you try to give your wife away twice i don't care what you what do you whatever you do you're gonna have a child i'm gonna give it to you to sarah same way with me and you thank god he didn't see all the things that we had to go through i mean he did but it didn't hinder him we come to this spot right here and get the new birth and then we start growing and then this holy spirit is a special anointing then you've got a special anointing there but this right here you have to go this way you can't turn the pyramid upside down because look this is the son of man right this person it's the son of man that's jesus christ because he has all this he didn't need faith he was faith he didn't need virtue or already had it because he was born right the first time you and me didn't get it because we were born in sin shaping iniquity had a carnal mind i know this is simple but there's a supernatural element if you'll pay attention to it there's something in there for all of us if you'll pay attention to it so besides all this paul's peter said besides all this add to your faith virtue because remember faith's not an ad face to birth faith is not an ad virtue is an ad one two three four five six seven everybody with me it doesn't say add to your carnal mind faith no it said get faith get faith first get the look how long and big faith is and besides this giving all diligence leave that up there for just a second because what we're going to talk about look and over here you see that this is the revelation of the son of god remember the headstone was removed it was rejected there was no headship and don't get me wrong down to the church ages you have to be careful when you say this but the headship was not the way it should have been in the church ages people were born again people came to certain amount of these virtues but they never had the opening of the seals they never had the thunder they never had the total open book to deal with because remember i told you a long time ago when jesus walked into that temple he opened the book he revealed who he was the spirit of the lord is upon me right brother brother said the greatest anointing not jumping shout and speaking in tongues no he knew who he was but remember he shut the book back and handed it to the priest so what had to happen in revelations 10 that same christ had to come down in spirit form and anoint a prophet in the end time with an open book and according to luke 17 30 malachi 4 5 and all those different scriptures the son of man had to come back god in human flesh in not just one man but men sons and daughters of god we know brother brown was the first fruits but listen without him we wouldn't know what was going on listen i'll ask you a question all right you ready blank brother round them out of your mind y'all blank me out why can't you blank him now he never came who you gonna listen to well i just get it for myself huh you need an apostle prophet a pastor teaching an evangelist to perfect you right so you're gonna listen to that's what i want to ask all these people think brother brown's you know gone wrong or whatever it is and he wasn't the he wasn't a prophet god's got to send to somebody or this confusion is going to continue we're just going to keep living and dying living and dying but there's a promise that god would send somebody i don't mind if it was william branham that don't bother me it don't bother me where he was born don't bother me where he was raised or how he talked it doesn't bother me that he said four thousand i meant 400 or what i i probably got that wrong that was a human mortal man but when he was preaching the word of god that was god speaking the voice of god now they want to to to discredit the voice of god well guess what they've done they put satan where he's supposed to where he wants to be the head of the church their so-called church not this church so the stack so that's the son of god that's the revelation down through the church ages everybody that was born again had potential to receive all these virtues everybody with me but now they did not have the they did have the potential because of the holy ghost but according to the word of god remember what i said brother brown said everybody got a box luther got a box wesley got a box pentecost got a box we got a box our box is adoption our box is to bring the head ship back our box is to bring the seven mysteries of the seven seals and the seven thunders and all those great things and i hope it don't go overhead and sometimes we use terminology and you just say somebody says seals and you turn it off just don't worry about it it's the plan of redemption it's how you're going to get a body change where paul couldn't get it luther couldn't get it wesley couldn't get it brother adam couldn't get it but he prophesied that somebody would and that's the headstone the son of man revelation so what are we trying to do we're trying to get us all up to that it's not that this part is not down here but he began as the chief cornerstone no doubt but he's the head now hold on who's the head who's the head what's his name what's the headstone's name thank you jesus christ right who's the headstone one more time everybody one more time hmm romans 8 verse 17 says is them children then heirs heirs of god and joint heirs with hmm hmm say man did i just not tell you he was a headstone i'm sorry y'all told me he was a headstone so now i just read to you that if he's the headstone and if we're joint heirs with christ that makes us part of the headstone the thing that's going to count this pyramid off and seal it like we're talking about well i'm getting ahead of myself but justification scientification and the body change we got to go through these different stages but let's go to romans we'll never get to this if i don't hush let's go to romans because we i mean hebrews sorry hebrews as in romans because romans gives us in part two part two of your birth your new birth starts here and then part two is the growth development all right part three is the body change everybody got that if you read it in romans so now let's go to hebrews two and let's just go scripture by scripture if you don't mind looking onto the to the screen or you can read it in your bible but we're going to go through it kind of slow that's all right a little bit of sunday school this morning seems like y'all are sitting somewhere else but we'll get through this how shall we escape all right how shall we escape if we neglect so great a salvation leave this up here and let them that's good i'm glad they can do that how shall we escape if we neglect our our bottom of the pyramid salvation because it all starts with salvation being born again not of corruptible seed but of incorruptible seed by what by the word of god all right which at the first began to be spoken by the lord and was confirmed unto us by them that hurt him now this is paul speaking god also bearing them witness both with signs and wonders and with many miracles diverse miracles and gifts of the holy ghost according to his own will right at the new birth you receive the ability to have signs and wonders speak in tongues god is able to give you revelation but he wants to go higher he wants you to know more he don't want you to just sit there and say well i'm a son and daughter of god he wants to put you in action all right so let's look at verse five for unto the angels hath he not put in subjection the whole world to come wherever we speak we sing that song open the eyes of my heart and every time i we sing that part says holy holy holy we know that in many um scriptures and then brother branham said that the the angels are before the throne saying holy holy holy they don't know how to say holy holy like we do they can't they can't say that with redemption in their heart they never they don't understand what it is to be lost but we do and when we say holy holy holy we know what we're talking about don't get me wrong god loves the praise of angels but he loves the praise of me and you more hello he loves to pray he'll tell him angels hey hush hush i got a child need something down here y'all be quiet i want to listen to what they've got to say cause they're mine i bore them they're my children they came from me [Applause] but one in a certain place testified saying what is man that thou art mindful of him or the son of man that thou visteth him now watch what he done he came down here thou made us him a little lower than the angels what the angels are created beings but god sent his son we'll see in just a minute lower than the angels he came down here in human flesh because you know what he could die he got tired all these different things that an angel doesn't have to worry with so he made him a little lower than the angels thou crownest him with glory and honor now watch and dissent him over the works of thy hands and thou has put all things in subjection under his feet who's that class participation if you'll say jesus christ that means you're not asleep jesus christ what's wrong with y'all today do i need to just quit do i hire somebody to come in here and preach to him huh will you sit down like a stone face like a sinner you ought to be happy sorry about that but good lord i've seen people get more excited at a concert any kind of concert i've seen women at a tupperware party that's been more excited than you all are and a baby shower oh look what she got it's diapers lady but thou has put all things in subjection under his feet now who we talking about jesus christ let's go back to heirs and join heirs he's trying to get us to see that everything has been put under our feet because there's one thing left and that's to conquer death who's he going to conquer it to angels who's he going to conquer it through people that are already dead nope he's going to conquer it through people who are already alive be alive and remain look for in that he put in subjection under him he left nothing that is not put under his feet but now watch paul said okay hold on a minute i'm telling you this but now you're going well now look we're still dying he says but now we see not yet all things put under him that's what we're looking at right here we don't see we see all things he's the head this is his feet all things under subjection to this man but we're still dying because we got growth to do we got growing up to do they always put all things in subjection under his feet what is subjection what is the when i started reading this i thought man subjection what is all this right here this is you taking your old nature your old part of you and putting it under subjection to this new way of life this new virtue knowledge temperance godliness not just that i can cry and and i can um sing good or i i got my gold star attendance at church it's what's inside of you it's what you carry out there but now we see not yet all things put under him and i wrote myself a note we still see death we still see death right and we look at ourselves go take a picture of the 10 years ago that you saw we was watching brother bob the other night 10 years ago he had some real black hair yeah he ain't that way now he looked like a little kid he looked kind of like that but not anymore his youngest has done growed up especially them girl kaylee especially i'm sorry i didn't mean to say that but we still see death so what have we got to do though if everything's been put under his feet something's got to evolve to take that death part away to where it says we but now we see not yet all things put under him and that's what we're working under the son of god revelation christians were going to die under the son of god revelation but a true revelation of the son of man you won't revelation son of man you can't die he's already died jesus christ has already died he's already listen if he's paid the price you want to say about about all of us all this baggage that we're carrying and we we try our best to uh get everybody to forgive me i i gotta have everybody's got god's forgive you already i know you got to make things right but if god's forgive you put it in the sea of forgetfulness and quit fishing we're pulling it back out we keep throwing the old doubt near the end and we keep dragging that stuff back up quit doing that let's move on with god but now brother five years ago i couldn't i ain't worried about five years ago i was doing some things five years ago i don't do now you ought to say the same thing that's growth development i still got a lot of other things to work on but there's a few things that you need to know you got shed out of your life it's shed shed off of your life that's why when this thing's brother branham will read the vision maybe a couple weeks from now but the vision he had a sister shepherd listen this was the pyramid right and brother brown was preaching on it sister shepard's standing down here wondering she's born again well yes she's boarding in cause she's standing in the water he said but there was a man up here at the top pouring water down in here and what was coming out trash trash was flowing out and coming down this way now look if this wasn't sealed it just go right back in but it's sealed so once it's sealed it just sheds right off resist the devil and he'll flee from you i like that i like that man i'm telling you if it was a flat roof we'd have trouble but look how steep that is running water everybody right now but this is us folks when i was reading this i thought man this is every one of us let's go to verse 9. but we see jesus do we see jesus we ought to see him more clear now than anybody they see him as a second person they see him as a good guy they see him as this person we see him as god almighty we see him the way he wants us to see him see that's why it puts us in that channel we're not out of the channel we're in the right channel heirs and joiners we're in the right family listen if you're not born again you're not in the family of god you're a child of the devil sorry we all were but we see jesus who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death crowned with glory and honor that he by the grace of god should taste death for every man for it became him for whom are all things and by whom are all things and bringing what sons bringing us into the family into being the heir of this eternal life remember my favorite quote jesus didn't come to bring you an inheritance he came to bring you back to your inheritance you already had an inheritance that was the immutability of god there's an inheritance there is eternal life there is growth development there is a camping off to the of the pyramid there is a body change but you've got to be pulled into that twice third pool second pool first pools god's pulling you into this place god's pulling you up that statue of a perfect man by what the holy spirit it's in exactly the right place to be able to look at the full story to look at the full picture of what brother brown was preaching you can't change this pyramid some people want to turn it upside down they won't do that leave it the way it is same way with daniel 70 weeks they want to change the chart well you know what brother branham we were talking to somebody the other day brother brown said this is that saith the lord how are you going to get away from that how are you going to get away from thus saith the lord then you're denying what the lord said oh no brother no you're denying what the lord said sorry for you buddy for in that he would put all he i'm sorry verse eight no we got verse nine so he should taste death for every man for it became him for whom are all things and by whom are all things and bringing many sons what into the fold into the family of god everybody with me and mate the captain of their salvation perfect through suffering he had to suffer we've read that back 20 some sermons ago he learned by the things he suffered he grew in grace and knowledge he came to perfection not in his soul but in his body that he took that god took over that body on resurrection morning which is jesus christ we know that it wasn't two separate people he didn't send jesus back to go under that body that was god's body it was god's body to start with thank god for revelation for it became him for whom are all things and by whom are all things then bringing many sons unto glory to make the captain of their salvation perfect through suffering look for both he that sanctifieth that's god that's jesus christ everybody with me put jesus christ right here all right for both he that sanctified and they that are who are sanctified are all of two what what i can't read that let me read that again for both he that sanctifies his later sanctified are all of one airs and joint heirs we got to start believing that that's where that faith has got to be we've got to build enough faith to be able to move up into virtue build enough virtue to move up into knowledge temperance patience all the way up everybody with me and look what god said for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren welcome in welcome home child let's go to hebrews 3 verse 6. i want you to read hebrews i know bob's going through it but i want you to read hebrews and take all the chapters out because to me that's a continuous letter to me and you a continuous letter now now man had to you know he paused the thought man started a new one by putting chapters in there but you're going to see in just a minute if we get to it we may not we'll do it this afternoon i'm not worried about it you go from hebrews 5 to hebrews 6 and they should have made that one big long chapter because it's the same thought all the way through so let's read this right here and we're going to read hebrews 3 verse 6. if i get finished with this we'll stop right here that we'll get this afternoon book but christ as a son over his own house whose house we are he's took possession we've let him into our house we've let him into the house but we've still got some rooms that we keep shut just picture god standing in your living room it's all right lord you can take possession of this this is your house completely you can have it it's yours well can i go on that don't no no no don't go in that dory come over this way yeah shy him away from that one over there like i told you many times before you know i'm glad brother brown said the holy ghost was timid he'd just let whatever you say that's what he's going to do it would have been me buddy i'd have the fireman's axe in my hand and if you tell me not to go through that door i'm going to knock your door down god's not going to do that because he's a gentleman and you know what if you don't want him to knock the door down he don't want to knock it down he wants you to make a choice how many of the preachers was preaching this weekend on choice and the different things it's a choice you got to make brother jewel on the different ones it's a choice you got to make that puts that predestinated seed there that puts that in the mind of god is that choice that you made now take choice away it takes free moral agency away it takes everything away you might as well just go home but even going up the statue of perfect man is a choice and you know what it's a hard choice because it really cuts away that spirit realm it really like brother bob was talking about and that stainless steel is what i looked it up while you're it's stainless steel are hardened steel is what they use but you know if you get cut by a real sharp razor blade you don't even know it now you get cut by serrated blade yeah right sister anna you get cut by a serrated blade and it rips and tears and pulls immediately you're doing this but now how many of you have got a real we used to hunt when we were hunting uh we used to skin deer and stuff but uh ricky fall bush we were hunting down in greene county and i had a wart that was on this finger right here never could get rid of it i was holding on like this and i mean that he had one that he just sharpened that thing up with shave hair he cut that thing on he cut it off and didn't know it it ain't going back since i never paid him for that but i see him again i'll pay him for it but i was cut and didn't know it that's what bob was talking about if a real good preacher that's led by the holy ghost he'll cut you and you'll never know it that's what i want i want to be cut uh if something needs to be got away from i want to get it out [Applause] because he said it's a two-edged sword it cuts going in cuts going out all right let's finish this and then we'll stop whose house we are he has took possession look watch this though if read it if we hold fast may i put faith in there if we hold fast the confidence and the rejoicing of the hope firm i tried to count i'm gonna finish counting but in the book of hebrews he says unto the end about ten times he's wanting us to get to the end of something he's wanting us to get somewhere he's wanting us to take a journey to the end consider the bible says the end of your conversation jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever unto the end which is the journey verse 7. wherefore as the holy ghost saith today if you will hear his voice harden out your heart as in the provocation what's he talking about children of israel there listen they're the children of god god give them a promise that they'll get out of egypt i'm going to take you out with a mighty hand and i'm going to put you in the promised land look what happened to them in between all that because they chose that way harden not your heart as into provocation what am i saying you can be born again and you can harden your heart to where you don't want these virtues or you don't want all them or you don't want to grow in god you say no brother ramsey brother branham tells a story about the preacher brother ramsey he says i don't want no more god got a spirit on him so i don't want no more god and got out and started going getting drunk and six months later he was dead brother brown said he took his child home so it wasn't mars name so our misbehavior and then brother brown tells us he continues on and says one a misbehavior of sin one sin can call the whole church to fail one sin that's why we need to pray for we walk in that door harden not your hearts as in the provocation what they provoked god in the day of temptation in the wilderness when your father's tempted me prove me and saw my works 40 years may i say 60 years we were taken out with a mighty hand in 1963 64-65 we were told the rapture's past due we were told that this book is now open we were told that now christ was on earth we have been told that the seals have been open we told that there would be a body change we've been told that there'd be all these great signs and wonders where are they we still wandering in the wilderness these 40 years wherefore i was grieved with that generation and said they do alway air they not me they do all way air god don't air it's our fault they do our way air in their heart they have they and have not known my ways they're not paying attention look so i swear in my wrath god was mad i'm i'm just reading reading the bible they shall not enter into my rest they shall get a revelation of the son of god but they're not going to they're going to stop somewhere and they're not going to let me do what i want to do you say oh bro wait i can't harden my heart after i get the new birth yeah you can yeah you can brother brown said you grieve the holy spirit said he goes out on a limb and waits for you to repent he don't go out of you and go he's using a he's using a scene or an allegory what does he do he says okay go ahead see if you can make it by yourself the lord just kind of stands over here and you know he just kind of said all right you'll be back here in a minute but go ahead right you'll be back here in a minute just go ahead and you know what that is though that's a testimony or that's a test or that's a journey that we have to take because listen ten times if we're we're typing the children of israel versus us ten times god took them out of trouble fed them watered them clothed them them and babied them babied them was the problem they don't then they got to where they didn't want the baby stuff no more but they didn't want to grow no more they wanted to go back to egypt hello they wanted to go back this is much better sitting in a baptist church where i can wear whatever i want to it's not bad looking like the world they're all good people they're all good and dead if they're not born again you look at all this flesh walking around on this earth brother brown said cannon fodder they will be ashes under the soles of your feet why because you made a choice you took the way with the lord's despised view everybody with me just for a second we're going to close right here we're going to read them verse 12. take heed brethren lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief oh bro wait i don't have no unbelief in my heart well there's the first one because you just lied and that's an evil spirit hello somebody let's just get face to face all right we're going to do some face timing today all right i'm just telling you what paul is telling us take heed brethren unless there be any of you an evil heart of unbelief in departing from the living god but exhort one another daily while it is called today you say well i don't call everybody listen if you listen to sermons if you listen to tapes or from church or wherever you're communing with god and you're communing with your brethren okay you don't have to get together with everybody and you know be face to face with them you're communing with god but you're exhorting one another daily while it is still called today lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of satan you can be hardened don't think you can't even after the new birth you say no i've gotta now listen be careful the bible gives you a heart of flesh it's not this thing it's an allegory that your heart's hard before the new birth and then when when god comes in he softens you up but remember you still got a spirit realm that wraps around that soul that you can harden hello you can harden and not let god do his work for we are made partakers of christ if if we hold the beginning of our confidence steadfast to what there's that word again unto the end steadfast paul is telling us look you're going to have problems but there is a stature that you're going to have to come to that you're going to have to suffer to reign you're going to have to do the things sometimes that your own self does not want to do but we'll start right there this afternoon but let me ask you a question because we're going to we're going to read down here in hebrews 5 and different ones talking about exercising and by reason of use oh it's not bad to go out and exercise your real muscles but what about your spiritual muscles musicians come what about your spiritual muscles what about eating good food food is good for you and truly as we'll talk about this afternoon when you're first born again the bible says you desire the sincere milk of the word you desire that that's what you desire because man you get somebody on fire from god that just got born again truly born again they just they'll soak it up it doesn't matter if it's milk it doesn't matter it's just so good it's so wonderful but paul says we need to leave that not leave it as far as well we don't want to do that no more no you take that with you leaving the principles of the doctrine of christ let us go on and to perfection and that's what we're looking at perfection and we can let's stand our feet we can come to perfection it's not an impossible listen i'm going to say this and say it the way i want to say it it was impossible for paul's group to come to the headstone perfection it was there for them but because of the word they had it was impossible for them to reach the headstone it was impossible for irenas all the great ones martin columba luther wesley pentecost it was impossible as we say impossible nothing's impossible to god but the way he put the plan out is that he wanted to wrap it all up with me and you he wanted me and you that have all the knowledge that we have even though it may be not worldly knowledge but knowledge and information all this that we have at our disposal to where we can read quotes instantly instead of having like dad had to do you had to shuffle through the whole 1100 sermons and find the right sermon that you thought he might have said it in that's why he wrote it on on top of the book but now see we can just punch a button there's what we need sometimes that's good sometimes that's bad but if you use it good it's really good to have that material and that ammunition to fight with paul says we which are alive and remain to the coming of the lord shall not prevent her into those which are asleep he he he probably maybe inside of him he thought man maybe it's going to happen but remember brother brown said paul was trying to get the people out of their mind that the resurrection was going to happen right then paul knew there was a journey paul knew that especially john john absolutely knew that there was a future church because he saw it he saw it all the way to the future home so he knew there was he knew there was more to come he knew that god wasn't coming in that day he was coming in another day in revelations 10 1 he saw a mighty angel come down he knew that that would happen when the seventh angel began to sound his message but listen folks are we like paul and john wanting to write another book of revelation saying well lord there's another one coming there's seven more coming there's seven other church ages there's all this coming no it's right here in front of our nose we're getting ready to fulfill every bit of that bible every bit of it we're getting ready to fulfill it are we ready though are we ready to fulfill it are we just going to go right on and and you know we're in the message hallelujah praise the lord i got my i got my 20-year pen my 30-year pen my 50-year pen remember they give you that at work you know they give you a 20-year pen or a 10-year pen for being there having seniority or something ain't no seniority in this message ain't no seniority you can come in this message and be 90 years old and and come to the headstone where somebody's been in the message and they're 30 years old been influenced as a baby so god's not a respecter of a person so let's sing a song god bless you [Music] but i long to rise in the arms of faith and be closer drunk yes ma'am [Music] thou hast died [Music] me now to thy service [Music] [Music] we ask in the name of the lord jesus that the guardian angels
