[17:34] Jesus name Amen Matthew 537 through 48
[17:43] and then snake time drop down to verse
[17:45] 45 square we already be getting the
[17:47] point by now and you may be the children
[17:50] of your father which is in heaven where
[17:54] you make us his son to rise on the evil
[17:55] and on the good and sendeth rain on the
[17:58] just and the unjust or if you love them
[18:01] which love you what reward have you do
[18:06] not even the publicans the same and if
[18:09] you salute your brethren only what do
[18:11] you more than others do not even the
[18:14] publicans so me therefore perfect even
[18:17] as your father which is in heaven is
[18:19] perfect alright now let's go over to
[18:25] first John
[18:27] you remember this morning we were
[18:29] reading very nice day at work says the
[18:32] disc generation that was to be created
[18:34] you know don't lose that point now but
[18:38] what we were talking about this
[18:39] generation that was to be created we are
[18:42] that generation the born-again believer
[18:44] is the generation that was to be created
[18:47] so don't lose that man's as we go on
[18:50] through our thought first John 3 we
[18:53] start with verse 21 verse 1 behold what
[18:59] manner of love the father has bestowed
[19:00] upon us then we should be called the
[19:03] sons of God therefore the world knoweth
[19:06] us not because it knew him not we love
[19:09] now we are the sons of God and it does
[19:11] not yet appear what we shall be but we
[19:13] know that when he shall appear we shall
[19:15] be like him for we shall see him as he
[19:18] is right and everyone that had this hope
[19:23] in him purifies himself even as he is
[19:26] pure whosoever committeth sin
[19:28] transgresseth also the law for sin is
[19:31] the transgression of the law and you
[19:34] know that he was manifest to take away
[19:36] our sins and then he'll his notes in now
[19:38] remember that and in him is no sin men
[19:43] who serve about it in him sinnath not
[19:48] whosoever senate that's not seen him
[19:50] neither known him little children let no
[19:53] man to see you he didn't do it
[19:55] righteousness is righteous even as he is
[19:57] righteous you have committed sin is of
[20:00] the devil for the devil sent it from the
[20:02] beginning for this purpose the Son of
[20:04] God was manifest that he might destroy
[20:06] the works of the devil whosoever is born
[20:09] of God does not commit sin for his
[20:13] seizure landed in him and he cannot sin
[20:15] because he's born of God in this the
[20:18] children of God are manifest and the
[20:21] children of the devil what one of them
[20:23] notes in the other one truly just sin on
[20:28] whosoever does not righteousness is not
[20:31] of God neither he that loveth not his
[20:33] brother
[20:34] you may be seated the Lord is blessing
[20:37] to the reading of the world no I'm going
[20:41] to do a little different this afternoon
[20:44] because what I'm going to do or try to
[20:47] do is you know you gently always you I
[20:51] do I try to just give you a little salt
[20:54] and then build up to a point and then
[20:56] blame I thought on to you you know go
[20:58] from dark and I found that sometimes it
[21:02] that works okay but a lot of times
[21:06] you're tired more out of sleep every
[21:07] time I get to my point to you don't get
[21:09] the point all you get is a backdraft but
[21:12] that's all right I understand so what
[21:16] I'm going to do is just tell you up
[21:17] front okay then we'll just tell you up
[21:20] front what I'm talking about and then
[21:22] that way you can make up your mind and
[21:24] do whatever and those on the internet
[21:27] and you see got the little button that
[21:28] said off you just put it off and forget
[21:30] it you know know how to worry about it
[21:32] but now I believe the scripture itself
[21:36] is self-explanatory yeah right then that
[21:42] way being self explanatory we don't have
[21:46] to worry about it so we read here in
[21:48] first join all right we'll just take
[21:51] your pointer four brothers put it back
[21:53] up the first Johnny three
[22:02] and you know that he was manifest to
[22:06] take away our sins all right now
[22:10] remember that he has manifested take
[22:16] away our sins okay but what does it say
[22:21] and in him is no sin okay I would
[22:30] highlight those two thoughts in my mind
[22:32] at least and then you drop down to verse
[22:37] 8 he that committeth sin is of the devil
[22:40] and here's the devil's children okay for
[22:45] the devil sent it from the beginning now
[22:50] all of us before we receive the new
[22:53] birth we had closer kin to us then God
[23:00] you agree with the Book of Ruth all
[23:03] right we got a closer kin we won't get
[23:08] folks to the devil we were born his
[23:10] children all right sensor will rot
[23:15] self-explanatory okay so he that
[23:19] committeth sin is of the devil but the
[23:21] devil said it from the beginning for
[23:23] this purpose the Son of God was manifest
[23:28] what purpose that he might destroy the
[23:31] works of the devil now what is the works
[23:37] of the devil oh it's adultery it's this
[23:40] it's um you know murder stealing that's
[23:45] not to work for the devil the works of
[23:46] the devil is to provoke the word amen
[23:53] when I'm in the church eight books as to
[23:55] discredit I discredit the word now
[24:01] that's the works of the devil I like
[24:04] what brother Steven Wilson another day
[24:05] were saying about it he said we want to
[24:07] put the devil away under some word
[24:09] that's way over that way in the he
[24:12] started out showing how that you know
[24:14] even the devil then the beginning just
[24:16] wanted to be like god no because that's
[24:20] you know he doesn't want to be so
[24:21] separated he's he different we call him
[24:26] the guy with the horns but Loretta said
[24:29] he's not down at the beer joint in the
[24:31] slot pins you know of the world he said
[24:35] he's in church they don't want to go to
[24:38] those things he's in church no lot
[24:41] closer what we think believe what it
[24:43] says men the works of the devil which is
[24:46] to destroy the revealed Word are to keep
[24:50] you and I from seeing the revealed Word
[24:55] that's his words did any tactic he can
[24:59] use he will use those to try to move
[25:05] hurt us remember one word in the
[25:09] beginning all right he said that I would
[25:13] have to be so we'll all we miss it that
[25:16] way all right so nothing watching it
[25:19] whosoever is born of God does not commit
[25:24] sin why
[25:29] milder he does not commit sin now we
[25:32] used to try to translate that we used to
[25:35] try to change commit as I'm being um we
[25:38] don't deliberately do it we don't do
[25:40] that we don't do this no I just read it
[25:42] and say what it said me whosoever is
[25:47] born of God does not commit sin now
[25:52] every person in the world is born of God
[25:54] by natural creation we said this morning
[25:56] but that is not the person this is
[25:59] talking about through this is talking
[26:02] about those who are born again whosoever
[26:06] is born bill God if you have the new
[26:11] birth all right he does not commit seen
[26:18] what for his Cedars would seek remaineth
[26:22] in him and he cannot sin because he is
[26:26] born of God all right and here's the
[26:31] whole thing in a nutshell a born-again
[26:38] believer
[26:42] as eternal life in their soul but our
[26:48] bodies spirit is still in Satan's
[26:51] delaney you know motivated by worldly
[26:55] things and it's not all Rome because we
[27:02] have to live we have to do have children
[27:06] we have to be husband life etc cuz
[27:11] that's all part of life all right now in
[27:16] doing that then I want you to think
[27:18] about something a person that's perfect
[27:23] remember is a person that I can anything
[27:29] be credited to you where you would be
[27:33] called perfect alright and see then the
[27:38] new birth is the only thing is perfect
[27:41] you agree leave Earth the only thing
[27:45] about us is perfect all right now then
[27:50] we come through with um David blessed is
[27:57] the man to whom God will not impute sin
[28:00] is that some kind of a person that is a
[28:02] special seed special something oh my
[28:09] family come over on my fire you know
[28:13] what is it they would be a person that
[28:17] would God do not have you seen so we
[28:22] found that out that you have to be that
[28:25] man
[28:28] right Joey we're dead to ourselves and
[28:33] born again then we have the new birth
[28:38] and what is the new birth it's the birth
[28:44] of the word in God's Word is his seed
[28:52] right so it's the birth of the seed a
[28:55] lot of people spend over time trying to
[28:58] figure out where these come from i come
[28:59] from what was and we was here whatever
[29:01] it was and they'll consider 15 the way i
[29:06] read that scripture looks whoever is
[29:09] born of God does not commit sin 1
[29:15] because God remains any just god that's
[29:21] not sinning right true God and in Seoul
[29:29] we are perfect and you cannot see them
[29:35] now we've got a lot of scriptures so it
[29:37] might take us go to services on this
[29:39] point those you save you have no say in
[29:43] your liar but the Bible says huh now so
[29:49] we got to get it right hey go now it's
[29:57] the seed of God which is the revealed
[30:00] Word now see without the Holy Spirit is
[30:03] no good right it's just see this letter
[30:06] Paul said in the letter killeth so when
[30:09] I'm saying seed you saying well I took
[30:13] this see you know I took some corn in a
[30:18] seed and I planted it all right because
[30:22] I've got to see well not what if they
[30:25] like that mechanically to look exactly
[30:30] like a seed you know it's running
[30:33] explained about the cornflakes and
[30:35] things got all the nutrition
[30:37] everything in it you remember but don't
[30:39] have no life what good is it what good
[30:45] is the word of God if it's not revealed
[30:52] all right no now to me then the new
[30:57] birth is the words you heard received as
[31:02] the topless says about them kelp is it
[31:04] says about it and then the Holy Spirit
[31:07] hang on the death hit hawks and gave
[31:10] life to that seat because a seed without
[31:14] life is a dead sea alright so now when
[31:18] it's saying whosoever is born of God
[31:20] does not see him for his seed reason we
[31:25] can't sin in the soul you can't see him
[31:31] with you have the new earth right right
[31:34] if you have a new birth in your so you
[31:37] can't sin because you would be saying
[31:42] that God was a sinner cause the sea of
[31:45] God remind Athenian right so are you
[31:49] gonna say the City of God seems no
[31:56] minded blood what am I saying the seed
[32:01] of God is what cannot see him that seed
[32:06] of God must come into our soul we made
[32:10] eternal by the new birth the baptism of
[32:12] the Holy Ghost and that bad kids my Holy
[32:15] Ghost cannot see him you agree all right
[32:22] so it's simple language the reason a
[32:27] born-again Christian does not have seen
[32:29] imputed until that soul is because that
[32:36] soul is born again but born-again
[32:40] Christian they do that does wrong Jim
[32:43] can be imputed through the body in the
[32:47] spirit
[32:48] that's right you be followed the
[32:51] thoughts that I've been trying to bring
[32:54] if you're born again there's no way God
[32:59] can see them go these inside of that
[33:04] give an eternal after soul then how can
[33:09] you sold seen you would be sailing us in
[33:12] that God's in no that won't work but if
[33:17] I was exactly right whosoever is born of
[33:21] God does not seen cause its seed so the
[33:26] seed cakes in the seat of God which is
[33:31] eternal life will get to where the
[33:34] runaround calls it you said the sea of
[33:36] God is the baptism of the Holy Ghost so
[33:42] you can't make that a sinner do that I'm
[33:45] just putting it bluntly we'll go back
[33:47] and we'll just go through a real slow
[33:49] you know going back to the point and I
[33:53] wrote it like this because I want you to
[33:55] listen sin cannot be imputed to the soul
[34:02] that is born again because it cannot sin
[34:07] because it's of God that's the see that
[34:13] remain athenia to see that remains in
[34:15] ian's get the new birth okay no but the
[34:20] Spirit can sin through the body and that
[34:27] can be imputed to us but now what we've
[34:31] got to learn to do that's like that's
[34:33] what people are failing to see we've got
[34:36] to learn how that sin will not be
[34:39] imputed to the body our spirit I think
[34:46] that's the key that's what I've been
[34:49] driving that all the services to try to
[34:53] get it to place cuz we gotta get
[34:55] something out here right knee because if
[35:00] this body is going to be change
[35:02] then that's the me as the working of the
[35:05] change in this body all right now
[35:09] there's the message see the sea cannot
[35:12] sin for his see who see God see it's not
[35:20] just my seeds not your seed you start
[35:24] see God's eat cakes in all right so we
[35:29] ought to know enough by now to know the
[35:31] ended by the new birth we used to thank
[35:34] the new birth with just some kind of
[35:36] anointing then you better click this
[35:39] they know your iPhone you sweat and
[35:41] another high school in sleep whatever so
[35:44] we'll move trying to click it a little
[35:47] bit you we do maybe they'll bring on the
[35:53] air conditioner we might hear being
[35:57] alone afternoon anyway so I don't want
[36:00] you sleep now listen to what I'm talking
[36:05] about run around and said my check these
[36:08] out with the with the many translations
[36:11] to see exactly what the scriptures say
[36:13] and brother Brown said that he liked the
[36:16] lungs of translation he said it was the
[36:19] closest of any of them and he said it
[36:23] was exactly right in content and
[36:25] everything of the King James Version now
[36:28] I agree that sometimes it's hard to read
[36:30] along sir cuz if you get so used to the
[36:33] King Jane do if the changes are her then
[36:36] it's not so in the King James said
[36:39] whosoever is born of God does not commit
[36:41] sin for his seed remain in him alright
[36:46] and he cannot see who the sea all right
[36:48] now listen to the lung the translation
[36:52] who's heard born of God does not commit
[36:56] sin because God's seed is in him and he
[37:04] cannot see him because he's born of God
[37:06] God see
[37:09] just get more personal but see the god
[37:12] you can if you send to the sea of God
[37:15] you'd be saying God was a sinner alright
[37:19] so that solves your problem so we want
[37:21] to be able to set back man listen no
[37:23] that's what I want to try to express how
[37:26] did the new birth legs that soul eternal
[37:31] and the new birth is the birth of the
[37:34] word if you heard you said other spirit
[37:39] lives I heard that you yeah you heard it
[37:43] somewhere right no how long do we need
[37:49] to go through it and the Prophet said
[37:51] though the seed has to come through the
[37:53] body hey hey right right they fill up
[38:00] that Ethiopian eunuch we're doing
[38:03] wonderful well he was reading the Bible
[38:05] and what he had to scroll but the seed
[38:08] was in the body which was felt all right
[38:10] me all right and so he could go there
[38:13] and speak to the Ethiopian eunuch and
[38:17] the Ethiopian eunuch went down to wear
[38:20] with it India or whatever the country
[38:21] there was and basically the whole nation
[38:24] receive the gospel all right so it's
[38:28] surely not a natural seed on some form
[38:32] that was in Philip because when Philip
[38:34] translated it over her God did to the
[38:37] unit remember he was a unique he had no
[38:42] ability to how natural see not even hurt
[38:46] people in this message say that if a
[38:48] person didn't house Ed couldn't preach
[38:50] well I don't get it no no no it's got in
[38:59] trouble cuz I always tell them say well
[39:00] the one I found out is a bet the worst
[39:03] problem is if you're wounded in your
[39:05] stone yeah yeah you got a problem but
[39:10] just get off of all that junk get down
[39:12] to the word all right now so the soul by
[39:16] the
[39:17] uber is old deal is the word had been
[39:23] made alive within us right the seed of
[39:26] God is made a lot to us eternal life and
[39:30] that seed then eternal life cannot see
[39:35] him me right but we're still in a realm
[39:40] of body and spirit were that we can do
[39:43] wrong now used to keep people from you
[39:49] know I try to go ahead and think if
[39:52] people do and a lot of this out on the
[39:53] internet system look he said what
[39:57] brother Dale I thought we were just a
[39:58] unit the body spirit soul okay we reunit
[40:05] body spirit soul now so then you have to
[40:10] be careful so you'd say well how are you
[40:16] going to claim it were a unit you know
[40:19] you and I didn't unit body spirit soul
[40:23] mix an individual okay now remember that
[40:28] the old Indian he said go ahead book
[40:32] first and really this is taken from the
[40:36] message preparation 1960 1953 1111 his
[40:46] only Indian he said he talked to it he
[40:51] asking me out how to eat how you do it
[40:52] he says pretty good pretty bad what do
[40:55] you mean pretty good it said well since
[40:59] i got saved so there are two dogs in me
[41:05] when dogs my one dogs why they just
[41:08] about all the time so the black dog
[41:11] wants me to do bad look your dog won't
[41:14] feel it did it good or the white dog
[41:17] wants me to do good which one wins cheap
[41:20] depends on which one fake most
[41:22] so we're two people right we're a split
[41:28] personality of a person in the basis
[41:30] that we are we can have eternal life the
[41:34] chief said after me say in the afterman
[41:40] save two people do dogs what you're
[41:47] looking at here is the black dog my
[41:51] actions and reactions of my body through
[41:54] the fact of my spirit because James to
[41:57] and 26 there's the body without the
[41:59] Spirit is to head so let's bring them
[42:00] rain into two bodies useless without the
[42:04] spirit another two parts of us is the
[42:07] spirit on the soul okay mono black dog
[42:12] thank you all right now in that mian the
[42:17] white dog on the inside and the soul
[42:20] wants me to do right the spirit working
[42:25] out through the body using the body to
[42:28] two diff things right it wants me to do
[42:32] wrong right and we're not necessarily
[42:35] talking about the dog tree etc because
[42:38] the Bible says that anything is not a
[42:40] faith its sin then we got to cover a lot
[42:44] of real I'm going to be really slow call
[42:48] my voice keep acting up so maybe it'll
[42:53] be enough to keep me to get the move to
[42:55] fight look what he says in the next one
[42:58] he said well that just say it saved and
[43:02] I just justification no let's read
[43:06] another one to make sure that we don't
[43:08] get no problems with this situation so
[43:12] he goes to questions and answers 1964
[43:14] 830 the evening service program 36 we
[43:20] come down pretty good pretty bad he said
[43:23] since may receive the Holy Ghost
[43:28] he said there's been two Dalton me one
[43:32] of them like no I'm one and what though
[43:34] they argue all the time so they growl in
[43:38] five it was another and said the right
[43:41] now wants me to do good and like God
[43:43] wants me to do bad well Tim which one of
[43:45] them wins the fight depending on which
[43:48] one chief vigilance so I think that's a
[43:50] good actually she depended on the
[43:53] warring of the body that's in you it
[43:57] depend on which one you cater to which
[44:01] nature you cater to the carnal nature
[44:04] after the things of the world are the
[44:07] spiritual nature after the things of God
[44:10] all right for them to say that we're
[44:13] just a unit and if I sin then the unit
[44:19] seems you are you follow me you said
[44:26] well if i send it's the whole unit that
[44:29] seems will not worry you after that you
[44:36] just agreed minorly may be shaking your
[44:39] head something looking or whatever but
[44:41] you did agree that we have eternal out
[44:45] by the new birth and the new birth can't
[44:47] sin so then it would seem is a unit
[44:51] after becoming the Christian that's
[44:53] impossible right I want the Bible I
[44:58] won't script your own name that fart
[44:59] that's impossible for Christian to
[45:05] seeing them a soul you and I saying
[45:07] God's in right right
[45:11] do then it's good thought about the unit
[45:16] because it is one through ten a person
[45:20] that is not born again now listen if
[45:26] you're not born again if you don't have
[45:30] eternal life we used to seeing them as a
[45:34] unit you're so your body and your spirit
[45:42] as a unit used to see them right right
[45:47] and a soul I don't have time to preach
[45:50] on it I've done solo home true you ought
[45:52] to think about it a soul is like what
[45:54] you call a kind of a moral obligation
[45:57] and even as a sinner I used to regret
[46:01] the things I've done you said let's go I
[46:06] did not enjoy it well it's all right i'm
[46:08] not trying to be any goody-goody i just
[46:11] talked back I am I go do wrong and
[46:17] unjust I would unfilled early because
[46:22] that was the sole you took your first
[46:25] beer
[46:29] the first beer he's right you felt
[46:34] condemned before you drink it in then he
[46:37] felt condemned after you drank it but
[46:41] then I her while I got where did my own
[46:42] effort why cause you sealed your
[46:45] conscience off running but to begin with
[46:49] you didn't cause that conscious of a
[46:51] human being is to be good so we sin is a
[46:57] unit when we're lost but when we're born
[47:03] again the born-again person cannot see
[47:08] him in Seoul that's why David you know
[47:13] Satan was speaking in prophecy blessed
[47:18] is the man to whom God will not impute
[47:21] sin we showed it to you in the Bible
[47:24] that God did impute sin the David ruined
[47:34] all by itself oh you just don't
[47:37] understand the great thing of the
[47:39] intercede you know you leave this live
[47:43] like the devil and did we all right we
[47:48] wrote a deal i'll bet you what I've got
[47:50] where the prophet said then I always was
[47:53] eternal
[47:58] well you don't need God Jesus Christ out
[48:03] in Lane this merger concern right I
[48:07] guess you think you just dies for me
[48:10] well I'm glad you think that could I
[48:13] think he died for me right now whatever
[48:15] you think about it don't matter to me
[48:17] it's what I think of that I think he
[48:20] died for me see because that puts us in
[48:25] that place see because I look I'm up I'm
[48:28] I split planning and whatever you want
[48:30] to call it I'm a black belt right now
[48:37] because that my dog it wants me to do
[48:40] right with that black dog wants me to do
[48:45] wrong right we get the point there as I
[48:50] said so you won't forget it it is
[48:54] impossible to even think about and I
[49:03] know I get mum nicely when I say thanks
[49:05] but maybe an idiotic stupid person they
[49:10] ever consider that God can see what
[49:14] you're saying now they say Jesus done
[49:16] wrong no don't play around with me I
[49:21] don't fool it if Jesus done wrong email
[49:25] us will be a mom right blood brothers
[49:29] don't your gift from it well I don't get
[49:31] what he done you did a slight natural
[49:35] you don't need a revelation you need
[49:38] pine common sense in God's in he can't
[49:42] the dama center right I suit you
[49:49] so now let's go into the thought so we
[49:54] must conclude that we do wrong with our
[50:00] spiritual being part of us this late to
[50:05] a body but the soul is pure and in his
[50:09] eternal by the new earth we cannot see
[50:14] him as we would call it as a unit
[50:16] because that would mean God would be
[50:18] sinning and that won't work but you got
[50:23] to divide the individual and that's what
[50:26] we're gonna spend the rest of the day
[50:27] probably wednesday night talking about
[50:31] it is to try to define this individual
[50:36] to see what we are you see that we're
[50:41] living here in a realm of Satan then
[50:46] we're motivated by that all right we
[50:50] have to be but yet we are Christian know
[50:55] who had turnover to Romans 7 but I just
[50:58] want to get all this on together turn
[51:01] around seven most of you know what that
[51:02] is you get rolling seven let's just read
[51:07] what the Apostle Paul had to say about
[51:10] us now of course if you want to go along
[51:13] with it I'll eat some of this go off
[51:15] with you want it a good old bag is dr.
[51:18] right
[51:22] the good old badness doctoring isn't it
[51:25] Oliver he got saved until he was over
[51:29] about the eighth chapter by lee 270
[51:33] after begin to wonder the 8th chapter he
[51:36] got away with no condemnation good or
[51:39] bad his doctrine you don't believe all
[51:45] was it I'm Christian in Romans 1 go to
[51:51] remember is written thus I another
[51:52] written in the world all right Romans 7
[51:57] verse 14 through 25 where we know that
[52:02] there were always spiritual but I'm
[52:04] carnal so over under see them Millie the
[52:10] policy within which I do I'll allow not
[52:16] for what i would that do i not but when
[52:19] I hate that do I to let me explain
[52:21] something here right around said on
[52:24] paragraph 2 30 of questions and answered
[52:27] book for in me now is two persons so
[52:34] that's the 10 by know okay now let me
[52:38] explain this all explains I mean for
[52:43] around explains that pole on question
[52:46] that's right of lytic 59 there Paul
[52:49] wasn't talking about going out living
[52:51] like the devil and you know this
[52:53] commitment dog trade night he was just
[52:55] talking about playing life everybody I'm
[53:01] saying oh and saying that I got troubles
[53:03] going on oh you're lusting after women
[53:05] I'm over here running back to this one
[53:07] I'm over you're doing this no
[53:12] you wouldn't man it's just normal life
[53:16] ok well let's read if I do that which I
[53:22] would not consider to the law that is
[53:24] good yeah it is no more higher than do
[53:27] it but see him that dwelleth in me know
[53:35] Oh are you saying you I said it's not
[53:38] one second he said extended birth in me
[53:41] for I know in me now he's explaining to
[53:47] me right he well he started off 17 verse
[53:53] seeing that dwelleth in late now explain
[53:56] to me where I know that in me that is in
[54:01] my flesh got no good thing for
[54:05] two-wheelers present with me but but to
[54:07] perform that what she's doing on wit I
[54:09] find out for the good that I would i do
[54:13] not but the evil which I would not that
[54:16] I do now if I do that I would not it is
[54:22] no more I'd do it but sin that dwelleth
[54:27] in Lynch now who's to me he just got to
[54:31] explain the body no I find them then a
[54:37] law that when I would do good he will
[54:40] express it with me where I delighted the
[54:43] law of God after the inward man I'm good
[54:47] remember to person so we're delighted in
[54:52] the log on after the implement but I see
[54:54] another law in my members warring
[54:56] against the law of my mind bringing me
[55:00] into the captivity of the loss in which
[55:02] is in my members black dog white dog
[55:05] right to person right inward part wat
[55:12] outward black born-again body snarling
[55:17] whole wretched man that I
[55:21] and shall deliver me from this body who
[55:25] shall deliver me from the body of this
[55:27] death' the you listen to what that man
[55:31] said that menu death was destroying him
[55:42] right he could prophesied to change etc
[55:45] the things but he knew he was living in
[55:50] a dying body that was getting older and
[55:57] death was taking it they didn't have to
[56:01] cut his head off he would have finally
[56:03] got right but he did you know the killer
[56:07] that's what he said I thank God through
[56:10] Jesus Christ our Lord so with the man
[56:14] and he said that the man across the EU
[56:16] right make a new creature I myself sir
[56:19] the law of God but with the flesh the
[56:23] law sin now not that he had to go out i
[56:28] can head it he was not talking about
[56:33] that he was just me to claim natural you
[56:39] and I today are dying you can prefer all
[56:45] you won't do when you get home and you
[56:48] can pretty up all you want to but it
[56:50] don't change you can get face lit up
[56:54] some better listen all kind of this it
[56:57] is don't change the Sun young guru died
[57:04] good we're in a body of death until this
[57:10] body is maybe new you know my vajay
[57:13] through everybody death so then we've
[57:17] got the problem all right ma'am so Paul
[57:24] what are you saying all said in another
[57:29] scripture he says I die daily we get
[57:32] through the minute without time with run
[57:34] run said see very soon we die David
[57:41] that's why I'm say he's you want to get
[57:44] rid of it come on now by the new birth
[57:49] I'm staying over where you won't
[57:51] misunderstand me as we going on by the
[57:54] new birth the soul is made eternal and
[57:56] the seed of God Romanian the seat of God
[57:58] cannot see it because the seat of God is
[58:01] the word of God which is eternal life
[58:03] which is got itself living inside of us
[58:07] move with our body and our spirit making
[58:11] the body work we are healing body of
[58:15] death we are dying somebody's got to
[58:19] look at that and I might wait brother
[58:20] hope years ago made a real good point he
[58:24] said you cannot destroy death until you
[58:28] know what death he is right that's where
[58:34] I come the phrase from it you know
[58:35] people say with their dad it's just
[58:40] physical
[58:43] no you're not dead you're somewhere that
[58:45] you just left the body and going
[58:48] somewhere thing you're not dead yet no
[58:51] matter who you are Center site you don't
[58:54] do it do we need to find out what that
[58:57] is all right if we read about it to
[59:02] destroy the works of the devil the works
[59:06] of the devil is to pervert the word
[59:09] because that is what brought death in
[59:13] the garden right agree in the garden
[59:18] death came because of reverting the word
[59:23] alright so we'll never go back without
[59:26] the pier word run there you think you
[59:29] understand that I didn't say that I
[59:30] don't never find know everything I'll
[59:34] never claimed to know everybody run
[59:37] around and never clean nothing hungry so
[59:44] then we need to get down and seven bama
[59:46] quit being sold super religious did you
[59:49] see yourself right I that out of
[59:54] people ever since I've been in the
[59:55] message the church so forth so
[59:57] spiritually hi no no earthly good where
[1:00:01] the other sounds are working minded you
[1:00:04] know maybe that's where i'm at dunno
[1:00:05] spiritually good but you know alright
[1:00:09] but now think about it
[1:00:18] if we say we're going again and we see
[1:00:23] it as a unit then where would we be at
[1:00:29] I'm trying to get myself to come back
[1:00:32] into the right line under coach right
[1:00:33] where I'm reading from see we would be
[1:00:36] saying that God is sinning now if God is
[1:00:44] sinning we won't go to my prom with the
[1:00:50] white dog in the black dog situation
[1:00:53] shows us that it's not as a unit it is
[1:01:01] the fact of a human being that is under
[1:01:05] the curse and being under that curse as
[1:01:10] far as his body is concerned to the
[1:01:12] spirit we are still of that cursed
[1:01:14] nature but by the new birth then we are
[1:01:19] put into a different place and by the
[1:01:22] new birth God cannot impute sin to the
[1:01:27] new birth you know what oh don't sing
[1:01:31] some run people anymore you ain't
[1:01:37] spiritual at all could you just all
[1:01:40] these other day on him I don't know hi
[1:01:42] sermon in the way no I have something
[1:01:46] amusing a way to be perfect with the
[1:01:47] mediator run
[1:01:53] a couple of services talking about we
[1:01:56] need to be David but that's the end of
[1:01:59] our sales anybody physically did you
[1:02:02] know that all right now burford the sake
[1:02:07] of understanding I've tried to make this
[1:02:11] point along the way now I know this is
[1:02:16] not going to go to good people gonna say
[1:02:17] Brett around said lame in I'll be glad
[1:02:20] to give you what I said my dad said
[1:02:25] there's only one scene he said that is
[1:02:32] to disbelieve God's work huh now go get
[1:02:41] ready back if he does move out there
[1:02:43] what you won't do no I'm not trying to
[1:02:44] destroy what he said I'm trying to prove
[1:02:46] what it says right sin must be
[1:02:52] understood
[1:02:59] because according to 1st John 5 about 16
[1:03:06] through 18 there's two different sins so
[1:03:12] let's read it yeah but more before I get
[1:03:20] to it and you draw all over the haywire
[1:03:22] not two different times it's two
[1:03:24] different phases degrees there's degrees
[1:03:31] of heaven there's degrees of gifts or
[1:03:34] degrees of all things and progress that
[1:03:38] there would be degrees of hell so sin
[1:03:47] must be understood by degrees so we're
[1:03:51] trying to establish not only what is sin
[1:03:56] but how soon can be destroyed all right
[1:04:01] so listen to what it do what jhansi
[1:04:06] first Johnny 5
[1:04:12] 14 or 16
[1:04:23] 5 you to work finally be over
[1:04:33] and then wrote down a scripture on
[1:04:35] someone but listen somebody find it for
[1:04:38] me go here to see unto death you know
[1:04:42] pray for that one but if you want to go
[1:04:46] run in and then somebody then get up
[1:04:50] here okay first John 514 yeah is that
[1:04:58] right okay you said one of God does not
[1:05:01] commit sin which I still another
[1:05:04] scripture said it you paint getting
[1:05:09] brother runs that you nervous it's
[1:05:10] annoying nervous I just missed it but
[1:05:13] turn their sin unto death you don't pray
[1:05:17] for that 17 right there is a sin not
[1:05:27] unto death not 16 if anyone's a brother
[1:05:31] sense in which is not unto death he's so
[1:05:34] ask me she'll give you a lot for them
[1:05:36] that seem harder to death there is a sin
[1:05:38] unto death I do not say that you shall
[1:05:41] pray for it listen all righteousness you
[1:05:46] see them there is a sin not on the death
[1:05:48] so now scene is not in degrees explain
[1:05:51] that to me now that there's a sin unto
[1:05:54] death but there's a sim not on the deck
[1:05:59] phases degrees parks whatever the words
[1:06:02] you want to use what you put seeing upon
[1:06:07] one level damage to disbelieve God's
[1:06:11] Word right do you got a problem if you
[1:06:17] don't understand
[1:06:20] record we're going to get down just a
[1:06:22] minute read my brother and said he
[1:06:23] seemed every day now that he disbelieve
[1:06:26] God's Word so now you can argue with not
[1:06:30] me you're gonna say I'm not destroying
[1:06:32] him I'm destroyed you and me he's right
[1:06:38] right who they must be degrees there is
[1:06:42] a sin there's two stages of the ceiling
[1:06:47] to death one stage of the sin unto death
[1:06:51] is a few black thing the Holy Ghost
[1:06:53] right right you can never be forgiven
[1:06:59] for blacks million long ago that is the
[1:07:02] sin unto death if you make light of the
[1:07:08] Holy Ghost if you do things you know and
[1:07:12] make fun of it whatever and you
[1:07:14] blaspheme the Holy Ghost you don't pray
[1:07:17] for that person right now you have to go
[1:07:22] through stages of correction in a church
[1:07:24] and you bring people before the church
[1:07:27] you give them opportunities to it again
[1:07:30] if they will not repent you go with them
[1:07:34] you take one you go yourself or somebody
[1:07:36] else then you take two people you go to
[1:07:39] the doctor I'm giving you right around
[1:07:42] the orders and then you yell in 30 days
[1:07:46] if they don't straighten up you take
[1:07:51] that person come under the bud and you
[1:07:55] do not pray for that person who only
[1:08:00] your friend right brother them off
[1:08:02] you're not getting this picture are you
[1:08:07] wanting to going to live like a devil
[1:08:09] you remember the guy in Paul leaving
[1:08:14] with his father's life in other words
[1:08:16] your stepmother
[1:08:19] he said turn six you won over to Satan
[1:08:21] further destruction of the flesh that
[1:08:25] the soul might be saved see that's the
[1:08:30] ceiling to death that you can't pray
[1:08:31] father we don't you tell me I can't pray
[1:08:34] for my children I'm not I'm just telling
[1:08:37] you if you want to do what the Bible
[1:08:38] said to get them straightened up we'll
[1:08:41] do it if you want if you want to go to
[1:08:46] correct route you try to get them
[1:08:48] straightened up we'll do it because I
[1:08:54] found out we run around them you can't
[1:08:56] turn them over to the devil right you
[1:08:59] can turn them over to God he turned them
[1:09:01] over to the devil so we're not being
[1:09:03] devil's to start with let's see you
[1:09:06] telling me I can't pray for the family
[1:09:08] if you want your family saved and they
[1:09:10] have gone to the point that they won't
[1:09:12] straighten up what do you want me to do
[1:09:16] not go to hell you think I mean I'm past
[1:09:22] drive to do funny rosette when they said
[1:09:25] I'll bring the stone then who's going to
[1:09:27] cast a much to give to me after I'm
[1:09:32] bastard I can't do that now don't care
[1:09:35] if the storm comes flying back I gotta
[1:09:36] throw some money because we got our
[1:09:40] church see that's the sin unto death all
[1:09:46] other seeing you pray for rather than
[1:09:50] the edges it you know I put my family in
[1:09:53] the hands of the Lord set up a farm I
[1:09:54] just pray father pray far cry out for
[1:09:59] but if we ever come and commit them to
[1:10:01] the Lord you don't pray for them anymore
[1:10:04] you're a predator you mean no I'm trying
[1:10:08] to save them you're the one that's mean
[1:10:12] you're trying to do is the Bible says if
[1:10:15] we keep our family in this world
[1:10:22] so they were able to sing unto death but
[1:10:25] you don't pray for all right unless it
[1:10:30] turn him over you God letting turn over
[1:10:32] the devil he said you'll see them come
[1:10:34] running if they're Christians is if
[1:10:37] they're not leaving you know whether the
[1:10:40] crease different but you see there must
[1:10:45] be degrees of sin known as I said you
[1:10:50] said we're running around and said grow
[1:10:52] brother though there's only one sin
[1:10:54] that's the nest believe God's Word ice
[1:10:57] exactly right because that is a sin unto
[1:11:02] death come on to disbelieve God's Word
[1:11:10] is a sin unto death anyone argue the
[1:11:15] point he's done solved right all right
[1:11:23] he turned around and said I see him
[1:11:27] every day with him did he disbelieve
[1:11:32] God's work or is he trying to explain
[1:11:36] the difference in degrees like I was
[1:11:40] trying to explain this morning of the
[1:11:42] by-product that the Prophet one case
[1:11:45] would be saying Jesus sexual garbage can
[1:11:49] by product not in the original then the
[1:11:55] other side she's a beautiful wife a
[1:11:57] beautiful jewel where you can type on
[1:12:01] one side of a horrible day the top on
[1:12:03] the other side the most wonderful time
[1:12:04] truly must be degrees
[1:12:08] you said when I heard this over and over
[1:12:10] well you're gonna hear one more time or
[1:12:13] even you like to get a blade cousin uh
[1:12:14] no you go to sleep put it off whatever
[1:12:17] you do but I'm not being funny on this
[1:12:19] being truthful do we understand what's
[1:12:22] it really is the Bible said anything
[1:12:26] that's not a faith is sin this is him to
[1:12:31] eat too much but show me where the
[1:12:34] Prophet said the too much don't send you
[1:12:36] to hell all right it might send you to
[1:12:45] the grave but it don't send you to hell
[1:12:51] but there is a sin that I send you to
[1:12:54] hell so there is a sin unto death in
[1:13:00] their SCM that is not unto death yeah
[1:13:05] i'm going to explain this one but i'll
[1:13:08] have to preach it later if you can see
[1:13:11] that there's a sin unto death of a see
[1:13:13] if it's not on the deck and you can see
[1:13:15] that red around can be explaining that
[1:13:18] sin is to disbelieve god's word and that
[1:13:23] would make you totally AR a blasphemer
[1:13:27] and then there is a sin that we see them
[1:13:31] every day in life and we do things that
[1:13:35] are wrong and how to appeal now if you
[1:13:39] can see those two things you'll see the
[1:13:41] white dog like no right right
[1:13:45] right and you'll see right here within
[1:13:47] us with that takes place you'll see that
[1:13:54] the sin that is unto death will not like
[1:13:59] the whole being let the scene of our
[1:14:05] lives can be forgiven and the sin that
[1:14:11] is on to death listen I love it right a
[1:14:15] sin that is unto death and never be
[1:14:20] imputed to the soul of a born-again
[1:14:23] Christian I love that but I just got too
[1:14:28] excited they want because he gets in
[1:14:35] mercian can be imputed county dragon
[1:14:41] when it's just a sin of life and that
[1:14:48] won't be unto death my causes go by the
[1:14:52] grave number an eternal separation cause
[1:14:55] death is eternal separation I hope you
[1:14:59] listen I didn't they do they go this way

[1:15:27] seeing your lives Britain breaking it
[1:15:30] down he's showing us that in their
[1:15:34] natural life that we live in this
[1:15:38] lecture hall said we follow after the
[1:15:42] desire of that spirit that's within us
[1:15:45] and we display it with the body if it
[1:15:50] was not that way we would not be able to
[1:15:52] live we would not be able to have
[1:15:53] children do you understand what I mean

[1:16:27] doctor is a lot of time to determine a
[1:16:29] lot of fun but now this one is our
[1:16:35] natural life the things of life okay now
[1:16:41] within that category of the things of
[1:16:43] life and living and doing things then
[1:16:46] that makes us subject listen to Lexus
[1:16:51] subject to greater things other than
[1:16:54] just living which would make us go into
[1:16:59] the form of lusty desire e 0 steely TD
[1:17:08] just a little bit

[1:17:32] over so okay since you said but brother
[1:17:34] Dale brought it round said seeing this
[1:17:36] time believe the word disbelief God's
[1:17:43] work right now if I go out and do wrong
[1:17:54] you we go out and do wrong don't lose
[1:17:59] something you remember the man said he
[1:18:01] thought he'd live a good life and he
[1:18:02] stood before that light and said they
[1:18:05] asking said he ever who was it no my
[1:18:08] call him out but he huh he said he stood
[1:18:10] before that light and said said he told
[1:18:13] me if you realized I thought I never
[1:18:15] have told a lie he said we're all at
[1:18:19] once everything come up before me all
[1:18:21] those little bitty lies have you ever
[1:18:25] stole anything so I thought I never
[1:18:28] stole nothing he said then it come up
[1:18:30] before me all those little things that
[1:18:34] were shady deals me
[1:18:41] because God don't all about what we're
[1:18:43] doing but in your natural life we go
[1:18:48] after the things of life and that makes
[1:18:51] us subject to the world of sin then we
[1:18:57] can go off and do wrong you know you
[1:19:01] laugh you have to repent good we know it
[1:19:07] isn't beauty all right under cap we
[1:19:17] brought a random now did you disbelieve
[1:19:19] God's Word every day look away to

[1:19:24] you notes Hebrews chapter 6 part 2 57
[1:19:32] 908 evening I right 262 now listen close
[1:19:38] as we read they said leaving the
[1:19:40] principles of doctors of Christ let's go
[1:19:42] into perfection then we got that this
[1:19:45] morning how that we are perfected
[1:19:48] perfected absolutely spotless and
[1:19:50] blameless not once in of us are you
[1:19:53] above temptation never do you see it
[1:19:56] every day yes sir but yet we are
[1:20:01] perfected because we are in him God can
[1:20:05] or judge us than nothing that couldn't
[1:20:08] be ratchet he's already judged us in him
[1:20:12] when he just Christ he judge me he judge
[1:20:15] you and he can't judge me again because
[1:20:18] he just took my judgment I've been
[1:20:20] reading honey leave the 38 I hadn't put
[1:20:26] that in as an addition later 330
[1:20:30] adoption 1965 18 part 2 paragraph 10 for
[1:20:35] you after the adoption would only stop
[1:20:37] when sins here I mean it seems did you
[1:20:40] notice that that's the visions 17 it
[1:20:45] says the same thing and it says in
[1:20:47] Colossians 1 14 it's the same
[1:20:52] then if you want to check okay you know
[1:20:58] God note the damage center for seeing
[1:21:01] you condemn him for being a sinner if
[1:21:05] it's Sarah smokes a cigar you don't
[1:21:08] condemn in fart piece of Center anyhow
[1:21:11] you see you don't have any sins the
[1:21:13] center home he's just a sympathy you
[1:21:17] don't have any sins but you have sins
[1:21:20] you that's Christians you notice here
[1:21:26] he's talking to the church keep her
[1:21:30] strange to see forgiveness of sins we
[1:21:34] commit sins but the center is just a
[1:21:38] sinner God don't forgive him my brother
[1:21:41] Brad did you disbelieve God's Word now I
[1:21:48] don't try prop it up okay go do your
[1:21:51] prop it up and saying well yeah that's
[1:21:52] right become very he didn't have all the
[1:21:55] revelation and he he went into a place
[1:21:58] you know he'd come later to that by ason
[1:22:02] just be honest run around with its
[1:22:09] London sign thank all Christians are the
[1:22:15] only one cause his sins plural
[1:22:19] Christians the only ones that have sins
[1:22:22] okay the main thing is what we got to do
[1:22:26] try to find a way to keep over being
[1:22:28] imputed right now go back make sure you
[1:22:35] don't misunderstand me Christians from
[1:22:38] the new birth cannot sin because his
[1:22:43] seed is the thing that cannot sin so now
[1:22:48] what's he talking about the black dog
[1:22:50] the other person that we are right it's
[1:22:55] living in this room all right did he
[1:23:00] said every day
[1:23:01] yeah all right go over to number four
[1:23:10] look what he said it from contending for
[1:23:13] the faith 50 60 to 200 we're tempted all
[1:23:19] of us are kinky all of us in verse 9
[1:23:24] without seeing it every day you see him
[1:23:27] Paul said he had to die daily and if we
[1:23:31] say we sin but and how does the end of
[1:23:36] the Bible says we make God to life so
[1:23:38] he's reversing his went right and we
[1:23:41] could not do that so we sin daily and
[1:23:45] His grace God's grace that saves us the
[1:23:50] same day to turn over the first John
[1:23:55] still got your bobblehead night first
[1:24:01] John 1 verse 7 if we walk in the light
[1:24:08] as he is in the light we have fellowship
[1:24:09] one with another in the blood of Jesus
[1:24:12] Christ his son limited us from all sin
[1:24:14] now listen if we say that we have no sin
[1:24:24] we deceive ourselves and the truth is
[1:24:29] not English well that's your tour down
[1:24:35] everything you've been popular I don't
[1:24:39] like home you'll notice it says it we we
[1:24:44] not a unit we miss fellow right here if
[1:24:50] we say this feller that we're looking at
[1:24:52] now I'm looking at you don't do wrong we
[1:24:55] are a liar mine enough if we confess our
[1:25:01] sins he is faithful and just to forgive
[1:25:02] us our sins and Clinton's from all
[1:25:05] unrighteousness if we say these old I
[1:25:09] always was eternal I never have been a
[1:25:11] center all right now the Bible says
[1:25:14] first John 110 if we say that we have
[1:25:19] not sinned we make him a liar you both
[1:25:25] are well are we safe but if we say we
[1:25:28] have not sinned we make him a liar and
[1:25:31] his word is not in US that's fun well
[1:25:36] you still know how to preach on greeley
[1:25:38] sorry I wish I did
[1:25:45] let's go on the illness quote for more
[1:25:47] look at number well let's get this
[1:25:49] murder if we say that cm is to
[1:25:56] disbelieve the word and put it in that
[1:25:59] category and when we do then we would
[1:26:04] condemn everybody because we would have
[1:26:08] to come back the Prophet saying he's
[1:26:11] sinned and saying Paul was talking about
[1:26:16] he sinned do you see what we're doing
[1:26:21] he's may be boring to you one of these
[1:26:25] days your nightly heart when you realize
[1:26:29] what sin is and you realize what I'm
[1:26:34] driven grow there if I believe like you
[1:26:39] believe that I just wanna live like the
[1:26:40] devil you might as well if that's what
[1:26:42] you believe because you are the devil
[1:26:46] but you is making it too much disgrace
[1:26:49] greazy Grich don't try to tell it like
[1:26:53] it is I thought the truth was gonna set
[1:26:57] it free latex gives me a license to
[1:27:03] steal with this go stale hey
[1:27:11] you see where what we're doing see they
[1:27:16] just just put it on the one lap some
[1:27:21] then when we love summit as sin is being
[1:27:24] the disability God's Word then you're
[1:27:27] putting the profit on the disbelief in
[1:27:29] God's work we're not looking like Roman
[1:27:32] 1423 we're talking about anything it's
[1:27:39] not a faith to see them what are we
[1:27:46] doing the prophet and the Bible if you
[1:27:51] understand what I'm trying to say is
[1:27:53] explaining the degrees are stages of sin
[1:27:57] how that there is a sin unto death it's
[1:28:02] you don't even break on but there's a
[1:28:04] sin that is not unto death did you dip I
[1:28:07] far so that's enough to explain it to me
[1:28:10] enough to you and I like it to witnesses
[1:28:14] so then we go to James 1 and 15 and it
[1:28:18] says that when lust hath conceived it
[1:28:24] bringeth forth sin
[1:28:32] then when lust hath conceived it
[1:28:35] bringeth forth sin and sin when it's
[1:28:39] finished bring forth death right who you
[1:28:44] were to see what we're talking about I
[1:28:46] hope you see what I'm getting at on this
[1:28:48] trying to explain sin and have it when
[1:28:52] the prophet said we seen each day the
[1:28:55] end of price I'd probably say Bible says
[1:28:57] we cannot sin I certainly no problem
[1:29:04] he's explaining that with a slow by the
[1:29:07] new birth we have the allowed word are
[1:29:11] to see the woot God the alazhi I'm God
[1:29:13] in us and that seed of God cannot sin
[1:29:19] but this body and spirit is not more to
[1:29:22] him and still can do wrong and that is
[1:29:25] called sin little rest any sin but did
[1:29:34] he say just believe God's work no he
[1:29:38] said it was a human none he said in
[1:29:43] human a human does wrong oh we run
[1:29:51] around you said we can live so close to
[1:29:53] God do we wouldn't see him much wrong
[1:29:57] because we get to God the less then
[1:30:00] we're gonna have our body right that's
[1:30:03] sensible so now watch what we're getting
[1:30:09] at number five pull it up let's get this
[1:30:14] oh no i'll cover a little bit me to go
[1:30:18] easily what is the seat of God does not
[1:30:27] have a seed you only have one seed in
[1:30:34] X's word right so then if that's his
[1:30:42] word then watch what I say what it
[1:30:47] excuse me mr. technical questions and
[1:30:49] answers 1959 1223 I got 169 who's read
[1:30:55] one of God does not commit sinful to see
[1:30:56] what is the seat of God the promised
[1:30:59] Abraham had to see to what is the scene
[1:31:02] now Christ his Christ the seat of God
[1:31:06] who see is he if he isn't alright
[1:31:11] alright he's acetal going the seat of
[1:31:15] God remaineth any the holy ghost comes
[1:31:17] down to abide not from meeting the
[1:31:20] meeting but for eternity eternal now if
[1:31:23] you want to put down your scripture of
[1:31:25] this Ephesians 4 30 we're not all this
[1:31:28] fear whereby you seal until the day of
[1:31:29] your addiction the seed of God reminds
[1:31:32] him and he cannot see him because he's
[1:31:34] born of God he can't disbelieve gods
[1:31:37] were a truth born-again believer cannot
[1:31:43] disbelieve gods were that doesn't mean
[1:31:47] as you know all the gods work you can
[1:31:51] learn that but you can't disbelieve
[1:31:53] God's work so brother rounds right when
[1:31:55] he said that
[1:31:56] disbelief God's work but then you break
[1:31:58] it down to sin that there's a sin that's
[1:32:01] not disbelief in the work is this
[1:32:03] natural living or doing cuz that see it
[1:32:07] remaineth in it cannot lift the next one
[1:32:12] from the token 963 901 the morning
[1:32:16] service / 120 there it is it cannot
[1:32:21] purse now the life ladies over it it is
[1:32:25] a token legs over that little body legs
[1:32:27] over that so love that person there is a
[1:32:30] token over the heart the Holy Spirit it
[1:32:33] belongs to God as he is when I see the
[1:32:36] token I'll pass over you a positive

[1:33:30] and he displaces listen
[1:33:40] the skin these the scene of God is the
[1:33:43] word of God you prove that but man this
[1:33:46] born of God is other he's on the scene
[1:33:49] of God in the seat of God is the word of
[1:33:50] God and he only lives by that what if
[1:33:53] i'm going for 11 paragraph to another
[1:33:55] and different messages what is the seat
[1:33:57] of life the Word of God therefore for
[1:33:59] life you can't come through the Creed

[1:34:04] denomination come back to the word now
[1:34:07] the seed of life amen his word is his
[1:34:10] seed and his spirit is the water hey
[1:34:14] birth means new creation birth means
[1:34:21] creation you're a new creature all right
[1:34:24] seat of God is in him he was born of God
[1:34:27] you know no Kenny commits notes in four
[1:34:31] he takes in see you've got his enemy
[1:34:33] cannot see it as lonely that Holy Ghost
[1:34:35] is in that you take some desire enough
[1:34:39] for seeing a real seat of God is an
[1:34:43] absorbent for the spirit when all the
[1:34:46] Spirit comes into that germ of life
[1:34:48] that's laying that it produces another
[1:34:51] seat did I say it while ago you say I
[1:34:54] got to see your corn you know how to see
[1:34:55] a corner until the water starts it you
[1:35:03] only got to see it won't hold no unusual
[1:35:07] I spoken words original see all of God's
[1:35:09] Son must be the same yes serve to be
[1:35:12] born of the word and spirit brings us
[1:35:15] back to the spoken word again i can john
[1:35:17] c 3 c to be born of water and spirit
[1:35:21] what does it do it brings you right back
[1:35:23] again into the place where you should
[1:35:25] have been at the beginning there's the
[1:35:29] reason of Christ's death bring us right
[1:35:31] back begin to work sons of God you want
[1:35:35] to say I want to say it's the seat of
[1:35:39] God that keeps in
[1:35:42] so then with the inward man most that I
[1:35:47] serve the law of God and no sin can be
[1:35:56] imputed to the soul of a born-again
[1:35:58] believer because that so we'll never
[1:36:02] seen once it's born again right now
[1:36:06] DeLeon it's got struggle right they
[1:36:10] won't see him I'm just going to game
[1:36:14] body and spirit yes so we're going to
[1:36:21] take it up in where David said listen to
[1:36:22] the man whom God will not impute sin and
[1:36:24] that will not be talking about the soul
[1:36:32] there has to be a way for that scripture
[1:36:34] be fulfilled because you cannot
[1:36:39] disbelieve from your soul diff you're
[1:36:40] born again look see Sam wonderful it is
[1:36:44] I can't see enough to go to hell right
[1:36:51] but heaven help made it even think about
[1:36:54] trying right this together there's no
[1:36:58] way that seal enough to go to hell
[1:36:59] that's it if I'm born again could I be
[1:37:01] puttin God in hell but if I'm born again
[1:37:04] I'm not you sure Satan can kill me with
[1:37:08] it but you can't make it come to pass
[1:37:15] there has to be a way that lesson is the
[1:37:17] main living God will not impute with
[1:37:21] special person no special condition all
[1:37:24] right not a special person nato 16
[1:37:28] special special person there was only
[1:37:32] one special person that Jesus Christ
[1:37:36] make on these things the seat of God is
[1:37:40] that word God has been made alive in
[1:37:44] your soul which is the new birth and
[1:37:49] there's no way that that sneak can see
[1:37:54] which is the part out here I still got
