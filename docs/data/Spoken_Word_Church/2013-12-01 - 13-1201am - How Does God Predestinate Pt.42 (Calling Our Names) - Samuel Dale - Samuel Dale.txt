Lord willing Maybe in another week we'll get back on to really covering a lot about predestination the seed etc etc as we go along but I felt it needful to bring these things in to see why that we need to be this and what happened to us and you know what's taking place and all like that Romans 8 28 and we know that all things work together for good to them that love God to them who are thee called according to his purpose for whom he did for no he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many brethren moreover whom he did predestinate then he also called and whom he called them he also justified in whom he justified them he also glorified what shall we then say to these things if God be for us who can be against us amen now let's go to John 10 we'll begin reading in verse 1. verily verily I say unto you he that entereth not by the door into the Sheepfold but climates up some other way the same as the thief and a robber but he does interest in by the door is The Shepherd of the Sheep to him the porter openeth and the sheep hear his voice now watch the hymn is God the Porter is a vessel used so that's the end time of the prophet's message the porter but remember whose voice is heard sure it's in the days of the voice of the seventh angel but remember the voice of God we're talking about to him the Porter openeth and the sheep hear his voice and he calls his own Sheep by name and leadeth them out and when he put forth his own sheep he goes before them and does she follow him before they know his voice and a stranger will they not follow but will flee from him for they know not the voice of strangers you may be seated the Lord had his Blessing to the reading of the word now we've been they're just past Wednesday we were speaking about oh I'm taking Revelations 5. I'm talking about the book that was in the hand of the one sitting on the throne and we found that to be the word of God right which is the Bible all right now it's not a Scofield Thompson Chain Etc you know oh it's not this aversion that version it's just a list of names the book in the hand of the one sitting on the throne is a list of names the prophet said 267 sardinesian Church age we gave our Sunday only names is written in that book all right now then when we look at that book we found out that being the Bible that it would turn out to be as the prophet called it in the church age book when he would speak of it and he was concerned about it because he had spoken in the church age book about uh if you'll go over about 266 67 68 and read backwards and forth there in the church age book you'll hear him explaining all of the things about uh you know the the difference parts of the sections as he calls it he called it three times in the church age sardisan church he called it sections of that book all right then we saw that it's not two books because that's what he was concerned about he was worried that people had misunderstood him and brother Lee Vale had brought it he said to his attention and it looks like two books but it wound up being one book the the lounge Book of Life The Book of Life the book of the living all is the same book but it's one book with many sections in it so as we were trying to cover now Wednesday just to pull the background up to where we're at see then the lounge Book of Life is the Eternal section of God's word this Bible here if you took out all of the things written of time you know and what's going on what would you have you would have a book of names right you would have a Moses a David or Disney you know who you would have a Peter of Paul and James and then you'd have the part that we'll get to in a little while the the part of writing our names are but you would have a list of names all right the Bible then takes that name and God did it so beautiful that he took the names and when he did he wrote a record of what goes around there that was during the time of that name all right see then uh you know like you may not find your name in the book I can find Samuel but what good does that do me I mean that doesn't mean that that's my name that was applied to some other Samuel so then I've got to be worried about whether or not I can find my name amen all right now see then the Bible would contain as we'll read in a minute not maybe your name but what would be going on on Earth at the time that your name is represented all right so then it's not as the prophet gave it he said it's not two books he says on works his faith expressed now I didn't pull these up for the brothers because we're doing it Wednesday he said when you get the book you're going to see maybe a little confusion there what I said the two books of life it's the same book but one of them is your natural birth the other one is your spiritual birth one leads out to the other one all right now then the Bible would as I said would contain pharaoh Judas uh you know balaams all of the things but that's not really in the hand of the one sitting on the throne because the names in the book are the ones sitting on the throne is only those to be redeemed all right because everybody else won't accept it right only the redeemed have their names into Lounge Book of Life all right now in dealing with that then we tried to to show a point that see you can say well my name is it in the book well we better find out all right so then the prophet in covering it the even he would say it looks confusing because it would be thinking about two books you know you'd be thinking about the lounge Book of Life in The Book of Life all right now then as he come across he says as we gave Wednesday the invisible Union the bride of Christ paragraph 308. he said the Book of Life is the word of God because the word he is God and God is the only thing that is life so your name was represented in the Bible before the Bible became a word all right I believed and I've always told you that I believe that we have the correct interpretation of the Bible in the King James version I believe that you know you may have some little wordings that would be you'd think would be different but if you went into any other language of the world you'd have a lot of words that you'd think would be different but the point I'm trying to get is the word of God is the eternal life section of that book that was what I was trying to get to Wednesday right all right it's not not just say a Bible upon setting one on the throne got a Bible in his hand no we found out the abstract title deed once Satan entered the picture went back to the hand of almighty God because Satan couldn't take it all right so it goes back to almighty God to be the the abstract title of eat and it would be only names had there not been a had the fall had not taken place you would have only had the point of the redeemable to come into being right all right that's right but see we know the fall did come so when it did but still it wouldn't change that book because they would have been the same amount of names had there not been a fall now I want you to get this point the same amount of names would have been there as it is talk about the lounge Book of Life the Eternal section of the lounge Book of Life the same amount of names would have been there of redeemable had there not been a fall in the same amount of names as here in the point of The Book of Life or the lounge Book of Life because it would be only the redeemed the rest is a natural world the Bible then is a record of mankind all the way from the garden all the way through ending up in the end time coming out to be you know the book in the hand of the one sitting on the throne all right that was the book to be taken remember that book now is sealed with Seven Seals all right and the proclamation went forth Revelations 5 you know who's worthy to come and they said the lion is worthy well when he looked he saw a lamb why because Redemption was going on all right now until that last name if I can get down that far in the message this morning until that life's name comes forth he's got to stay there all right see now if you say like a lot of the people in the message they said where the Redemption was over in 63 within 99.99 of what I'm looking at me included would be lost and I gave at least one percent of one percent would it'd probably be 100 of all of us right but the prophet said when the lamb when that life's name said he's got to stay there until that last name is made manifest all right well see then if we believe that there's somebody else to be saved then the Lamb's not left The Mercy Seat as everybody says you know now if he left The Mercy Seat immediately Mercy Seat becomes judgment seat I mean that ought to be sensible so then you're saying in 1963 judgment struck oh that's fancy you know makes people you just don't realize then they're telling you you're lost and the people sitting there enjoying listen oh that's wonderful wonderful of what you're lost because if you wouldn't say before 63 and that Doctrine is right then you're lost that's what they told me when the first come in the message I said well I'm sorry according to my Bible and the prophet I'm reading after Redemption was over before the world ever begun that's what Revelation says right so then who's got there's no argument see but that doesn't change anybody but if it's just a point you know but you see church then we've got to see something in this day so if the Book of Life is the word of God as he said and your name was represented in the Bible before the Bible become on word you know what I'm saying and you know what he's saying in other words before it was written because the book and the Hand of the one sitting on the throne is a list of names of the redeemed and they were put there before the world ever begun that's how beautiful it is all right now what we're dealing with and I want to get to two things in a minute I want to cover this right here where you'll think about it but we'll come back to it in a minute in a message now see what you and I are doing is we're just finding out you remember I gave it Wednesday night the prophet said ain't no new name wrote down in heaven he said that's contrary to the Bible he said my name wrote down in heaven today I got born again that's contrary to the Bible no that's not true you say well I've been taught that all my life well it's about time we wake up and get away from what we've been taught it couldn't be a new name written down he was either written there before the foundation world or it never will be there all right so then if we're covering it see it's not a name written down it's finding out that your name is written right now here's what I want to emphasize and I'll do it again in a second when we got we've joined the Baptist Church Methodist Presbyterian Pentecostal et cetera et cetera when you got the new birth in other words we didn't know anything about our names being written on a book of life very few people could even talk about it for a few preachers would even speak about it right so really when did we start thinking about our name being written in the book when we heard this message right we may have read those things I'll get back to that in a minute we're reading something is not a revelation it's when it's revealed to you the word's not alive until the Holy Ghost quickens it right all right now so then if it's finding our name written see this message this end time message is is showing us that our names are there that's the message that's what the prophet came to do all right so it's not fine not saying my my name was written down today I got born again no that's good Baptist Doctrine then they got that little card that anywhere you go they mail that thing with you that tells everybody where you got born again at and you know and how you remember in good standing or if you're not in a member and good standing because I used to be there and we had send some you know because you go anywhere out west and you go join a church you just call back they send that little card so they think when your name was written on that little card it's written down in heaven knows even the prophet said either written before the foundational world or it'll never be written see because his fore knowledge will let him know all right so then when he gets to Invisible Union he makes a statement that sounds odd in putting these two together now that you're finding out that your name is written right finding out by the reveal word by the end time prophets message we're finding out it our name is written in the last book of life all right so then watch what he said when he gets to the invisible Union he said your old book is gone paragraph 2 2 3 2 23 224 they didn't get this either now says your old book is gone with your old Union now your name in your old in your has been transferred and you say do you mean to tell me that my old book God put it in the sea of his forgetfulness what is your old book your old life right so now you see then we come over into the book because Paul said that we were lost we need to be saved Paul said we had our time in past as other gentiles me lost all right so now the going with the old book is what your old nature in your old ways but he said it's been transferred well see that looks like to us transferred means well it was over here and we'll race it out and put it over here we'll see then that's adding a name so that wouldn't be correct right but if you can see it a race here you can see he transferred it he's the one that does the work not you and I and we see our name we see our name written in The Book of Life the whole Union is gone listen what he says now your name is now in this new book not the Book of Life but the lounge Book of Life all right so the book of life is what the Natural Life of mankind right that's your two books it's not two books it's the same book different sections right he said now your name is now in the new book not the book of life but the lounge Book of Life what the lamb redeemed not the old book of your natural Union what's he talking about your natural birth your natural doing but your new bride Hallelujah your new life is in the lounge Book of Life your marriage certificate how Hallelujah were your true Eternal germ from the beginning takes hold all right now are you getting the point of what I'm saying there's not a new name written down it's finding out your name is in that book all right now not trying to find your name like Gary Atkins I mean and then turn around and spell it just a little bit different and get Gary Krantz see now you got the Gary spell two different ways maybe or something see you it's not that it's the day and the hour that we're living in the word we'll get to that in a minute and cover it but I'm trying to get you to look at it see then your name is not transferred like it was over here raced out and put over here now that be putting a new name so you can do what you want to about it but if you look at it with the two quotes together see you're realizing your name is dire by this message we realize that old nature in that old ways is gone by the new birth all right then we see our name there so we can say it was transferred but it's not transferred you get what I mean if you transfer something you take it out of that space and you put it in another space really the word transferred is changed look it up changed you got to run it on down through it it also means a conveyance of right or title conveyance of right or title you know all right so it's transferred but not erased not a hole over here and put it over into here it was either there before the foundation World it won't be there according to the prophet in the Bible how many quotes do you need on that part of it see then church what are we talking about now listen to the point see I want it revealed to me we'll read where the Prophet says is my name there is your name there we'll read where he says John's name was Dire and Elijah's name was there but I want to know if my name's there all right and I want to find out how it got there you know they said name is the greatest thing in the world because you can be in a crowd of a million people and somebody say dick Addison well he's not looking for forty thousand other dick Addison's he's listening to The Voice now so think about it now trying to get over from where we were because the Bible contains the names not of every name written out you know but this Bible contains the names now listen to where I'm saying it of everybody that would ever be in the world because it gives you a day a time a section this the Old Testament was lived through the New Testament the Ages was lived through everything lived through right in the Bible you said well what about the ages go to Revelations two and three and you've got the ages written in life the Bible is not just deeds and thoughts it's a revelation of God living in mankind down through time are you following me all right now then you wouldn't be writing a new name but you're finding out your name is already there and did you notice the statement I mean I said everybody in the world's name is in this Bible yes a seven billion today you know with everyone in this Bible you want to read it turn to Revelation 3 and read read the seventh Church age right it's not a night let's let's listen to me oh my way now don't be silly we'll read in a second where the Prophet said is what's going on for the age all right but I want that in your mind to think about it that this Bible contains the names of people but we've got to be able to find it they got these coded things they can figure out you know and they got the coded things about this and the coded things about that and the secret code I don't know about that but you remember one of those guys over in Egypt there somewhere somebody figured it out and and wrote it and said he's going to get killed and he did he had the Bible he said to prove it with well that's all right no problem I ain't trying to figure out no secret code and you better not either gotta remember my story about it there's a guy used to get a newspaper a day ahead of time boy he's doing good he could play the stock market he could play the horse races he could bet on anything he wanted to because he already knew what's going to happen but one day he read the obituary he found out he died the day before well let's don't try to play with the Bible if you're following me trying to find a name to her as a name of Richard Marlowe that's not in the Bible all right but yet God says it's in there all right now follow what I'm saying go ahead with number one we'll just get it because I quoted a lot to you but look what the prophet of God says about this this is taken some questions and answers on the seals uh 63 324 in the morning service paragraph 112. brother Branham is the lounge Book of Life and the Book of Life the same book sure I love you because that's where all redemptions wrote In This Book now what's he talking about the only one one book I know of that all Redemption can be concerned is the Bible right their names are in you say well uh our names put on the Lamb's Book of Life I got it put on the other night no you didn't no you didn't you just found out it was on there the other night because their names were written before the foundation of the world see that's it's all the same book all right so it's two sections one book the Bible tells you about the natural things of life you go in there and read it it says uh that they stood before the Watergate and read the word well this message came before Watergate came into being oh and it says in the scriptures that the time that they'll be that the towers will fall well all right we could put that with the Towers falling in our day it's in new here we can read it that all these great things things are supposed to happen these earthquakes these um typhoons these everything we're in the last days because the Bible says that well we're studying it in the right form right but now look what your Prophet says go to the next one just to get these in your mind he's talking about his name you know not written in Atlanta Book of Life and Foundation world when was your name put on the book of life before we ever had a world you were chosen to receive the Holy Ghost in This age now if you don't need nothing else to put your book name in the book there it is but we quote these things is it a quote or is it a revelation which one is it is it a quote that we go to Revelations 13 8 and all that dwell upon the Earth shall worship Him whose names were not written in the Book of Life of the lamb slain from the foundation world is that a quote or is it a revelation which one is it is the next one the second Corinthians three and six well also hath made us able Ministers of the New Testament not of the letter but of the spirit for the letter killeth the spirit giveth life it is just letters on the page quotes well the prophet said that's what we'll get that done Prophet said he saw me there all right I'm sorry that I'm just that old arrogant guy that has to come up with a wrong answer he was in hell and he was in heaven where did he see you at right of course you don't want that do you no no he saw me in heaven well then why don't we act heavenly remember whatever we are here is what we are there whatever we are there and whatever we are here well they needed a quote to us foreign you know Moses was a pretty good guy he was told by his mother I know you got the videos and the movies you see then he was on up you know he didn't find it out until he was 40 years old or something but remember your Prophet said his mama told him well he said on her knee that you are not the son of child and Ella Branham right in the wrong names right you're not never who Moses Mom and Daddy was their names you're not that you're not Pharaoh's daughter either you know from her you're a special chosen you say why don't you say it that way because wasn't he oh yeah we put him down as to be the child also and so and so and so but you know really he was chosen before the world right I'm trying to get you to see a revelation instead of natural words all right man and Moses heard that all of his life you know what he one day finally figured out oh this I've been told this by my mama she's raised me I know who I am so I'll go out and deliver the children of Israel they failed didn't he yeah Mama's Revelation wasn't enough made a failure all right but you know one day at a burning bush he got a revelation had he stayed down in Egypt to start with he could have probably caused a pretty good Insurrection he was the head of the of the armies the militaries and and everything he could have caused a coop you know to be taken over and he could have took over but that wasn't God's way of doing it right so put in a burning bush he got a revelation of who he was right now say he saw his name in the book you know he's part of God's economy now whereas Moses the soldier was not a part of the economy of God but now Moses the man with a stick going to Egypt to take over he's got a revelation my point is what are we leaving off of quotes or scriptures or whatever or what somebody says or are we gonna and we got a revelation you know Abraham was told in his early life when God first met him your seed will possess the Gate of the enemy right but you know one day that became personal to him it was revealed to him he confessed it for 25 years right pretty good confession but you say well now now brother Dale well now let me just get into scripture just to her remember he was trying to kind of deal with God because he said duh you know let Ishmael stand before you right now don't you think he kind of I don't come on I know the scripture that Abraham doubted not but go back in his natural life and read it he was trying to get God to let Ishmael be the I mean you know this won't be the one instead of Isaac but you know one day it dawned on him hey that ain't it because God met him and said the Covenant is not with Hagar not with Ishmael Mercedes with Sarah and said that's going to be the child coming from there you know what he could produce a child in we were listening to a tape the other day and I thought how marvelous a prophet could be and he was talking about Jacob you remember in his journey and read your Bible about Genesis 31 there and he said Jacob get up take your family go home he said I'll bless you well he gets up takes his family if he don't find out that it's well I've kind of stole for stuff from Daddy and none brought it along with him but brother said Barry gets out so far and said he's got I can't remember his name what is it blame it sure what his name is he said there he is then his daddy lost behind him wanting to kill him about his idols if she carried off and said Esau's in front of him but said God had already told him Jacob go home I'll be with you well you know he didn't believe that until he met an angel of the Lord one night and he wrestled with him for a while and he come out of there he was limping but he had a revelation sure he still respected Esau and everything else but yet he wasn't afraid what about it has it been revealed to us what the prophet has said to us now laid the foundation with that that we didn't even think about her name being in the Book of Life we didn't think about that when it was an organized religion but when we come in this message but did that put my name there no I just found out it was there but the prophet preaching it to me because my name was either put there before the foundation World it will never be right man brother Dale I just ain't got no hopes uh let's see I believe I got it in here where he says it you say well we'll brought around today but one going out of Jeffersonville you remember that same statement like that he said well then I got to believe I'm that one they were one going down to Georgia I'm sorry for the rest of y'all you got to find you another state because I done got to you know my claims on that but you know what you got to believe that you're the only one and I got to find me another state right sister Gayle you got to believe for yourself you understand what I'm talking about we can talk about a name being written in the Lamb's Book of Life we can talk about in quote how it gets there we can go through the prophet's message of How It's your name is written in the Book of Life at sanctification and you can see that Judas iscaris name was even in the Book of Life but remember it was not in the Eternal section so thereby his name could be removed the prophet said as a matter of fact if we don't repent it's not even on there what about those that their names are written nowhere you've got four classifications in the church age book if you'll read that 268 backwards and four you'll read it somebody whose names is in the last book of life can never be removed someone whose name is in the Book of Life like Judas and their names can be removed some of whose names will be added later all right and some whose names were written over all right but you say what but no no no God don't have to have a record here's his record you don't have to have no stamps with you know a record down through there you know and a list of names all right so now think about it are you getting the point it's got to be revealed all right it was put on there before the foundation of the world or it'll never be put to our it comes up the end of thinking about this little point that was asked the prophet go ahead with number five which is questions and answers on the seals 1963. and they're asking him a question about is ever true Jew born since Christ came came will be saved you know 140 and he's got he said there's three questions is it true that ever born Jew born since Christ they came into the world is to be saved no nothing will be saved only those whose names were put on the lounge book of life before the foundation of the world you are Gentile see that's all the book holds that mystery and the book is only unfolding it now not each one's name but what the mystery of the book is while it's calling those names you got it well puts your name in the book so then the first church age was in the Bible but then one day it became on a book was written second Church age Etc right why because there's a mystery we better be concerned about the mystery Martin Luther had a mystery of the just shall live by faith Martin or Luther needed one is in the Bible in the point of a name right but when the judge shall live by faith is involved that put Luther's name right in the book not looking for a name of writing out a name look for what's going on in the hour that we're living all right the book doesn't say now levale is to be saved in time of this church age or or Arman Neville or whoever know it don't say that it just shows the mystery unfolds the mystery of what the thing is but we ourselves by faith believe it that's what I said the other night someone said well there's no need in me trying it brother Branham said there's only going to be one saved out of Jeffersonville see now see it's showing a parable that that isn't it that that isn't it there might be thousands saved I don't know I hope every one of them is saved see but I don't know but here's the way I want to believe it I'm that one you believe the same for you if you don't see people that say well I know brother Branham is going to be there but I don't know about me you know I'm sorry sometimes I can read oh you say I'm the one you believe that same for you if you don't and there's something wrong with your faith you're not sure what you're doing you're going to argue with your prophet well we know I'm sure I believe Brothers going to be there but I'll read you a quote in a minute where wrote around and said I don't know where I will or not I believe it will you know he had to live by faith right so think about it now think about what we're trying to say not each one's name not levielle Samuel Dale anybody James Cauley whatever it's not that away it's the mystery of the hour that we're living all right The Mystery of the hour that we're living in the word for this hour Paul said the mystery whereof I'm called now what was his call to preach to preach the mystery which was Christ The Mystery of God revealed right that's why I called him to preach not some rooster up in a tree crowing her mom and dad said calling him and daddy sending him what's wrong with the preachers well brother Dale my call was when I Heard a Voice well amen let's just make sure it's the right voice now think about it see we want to lay a lot of things on to other people we said I know I'm going to be there because I love the prophet's children brother told me that one day he said I pray for his family continually and said I know I'm going to be there well now is that the only reason he's going to be there you see what I'm getting at y'all gotta have something to prop up for beings with right you know you never ask a person a question they don't give you some form of answer we said well we know brother Brown's name is in the book A Lot he said he didn't know he lived by faith we don't want that quoted when we say John they run around and said John's name was there well that's a pretty good point but how did John's name wind up being there was either John over here and then John goes to Patmos and then John's up in heaven I wish I was sure his name was there well I believe it was too all right but you know John had to live by faith you know that John after being born again for 60 years because you calculate from 30 or 33 everywhere you want to start when the Holy Ghost fell in about 93 John was on Patmos 93 94 95. that's 60 years according to my calculations that John had already had the Holy Ghost and because in Revelations 5 that he couldn't see a lamb to take the book he was crying like everything we better be doing a little bit of crying folks and get concerned now listen to what your Prophet has to say about John go ahead with number six is taken for the breach between the church ages and the seals 63 317 paragraph 297. what a jubilee going on in heaven when that the lamb leads leaves that intercessory box to come to possess his claim you know what that got next to John he must have saw his name wrote dark then he tells your word that he found it from when the seals broke he must have got real happy listen he said and he said remember he said every creature in heaven he didn't hear every creature saying he said every creature in heaven haven't heard him saying that's right you're a creature run around and explained it John said they heard him one because he found a redeemer he said John Musta saw his name wrote there well that would be all right and that'd be for John and we can go through the story of producing the show that surely John did because remember in Revelations 5 there was 24 elders there were 12 Apostles and 12 Patriarchs and John would have been one of those 12 right so when you get on over about 19 somewhere in there you'll find out the foundations the gates and all of these things and the names in them and John surely by the time he gets over the in the Book of Revelation he done found out my names are but did he know his name was there that way or did he know it by revelation which one was it there's plenty of John's right but you see we've got a pretty good case to bring because he was one of the 12 apostles his name is there but my point is is that what he's building on or was it in other words why didn't he in 60 years see a little bit of something about his name and if he believed his name was Dire why was he crying for a redeemer come on see evidently he there's something a little bit lacking there wouldn't it but then one day he got a revelation didn't he now when you come back from Patmos he didn't have no problem he said hi John I say you and this I've seen love I've seen it to the right of this is where it is you know I've seen the Antichrist he began to realize who he was look at the next one which is paragraph 303 of the of the breach that's what we call it the breach between the seven Church ages and Seven Seals talk about a happy time when them seals broke John must have looked in and seen a past a curtain of time and said there's John oh he was so happy he said everything in heaven he must have really cried out didn't he look at the next one the fourth seal preached in 1963-323. paragraph 364. look Elijah never knew even one of them was that way now who's he talking about nothing running around him now Elijah he thought he was the only one saved until God opened one of the seals and showed him the mystery of the book that's uh the Elijah number one right now number one was the guy was that thought he was the only one saved now look God opened one of the seals and showed him the mystery of the book that he had 700 that had never bowed down to them Creeds you remember seven thousand remember where he was quoted but they had when God opened his book to Elijah he said now wait a minute son I got 700 that's tucked around out there got their names on the book since the foundation of the world they're mine sweet he said God opened the seals that's the reason I think John was doing all that shouting jumping over to John right the other night he must have seen his name on dire you see see one day God opened but now listen well let's go into the next one because I want to get these look to harvest time preaching 64 1212 paragraph 127 28 29 it was at the meeting the other night that little assembly brother Assembly of God brother and sister sang that song I wonder if John saw me when he saw all the nations gathered did he see me sure he did if your name was on that book and when John's name was on it too and he went because there was nobody that could touch it and then one of the elders come and said we've not John for the line of the tribe of Judah has prevailed John was looking around trying to find a line what happened to lamb come forth he come and took the book out of the right hand of him and called everything what was on that book it's The Complete Book of redemption you're going to read in between the book of redemption and the things look what he said you have no ending of life if your name is on that book the lamb come to redeem it not all that professes Christians that profess Christians not all that try to live good and holy but those whose names were written on our he redeemed that and that alone whose names were on the book no if you notice there's a key here that I want you to remember but around said when God opened one of the seals John saw his name he said when Elijah God opened one of the seals John saw his name he said well brother Dale the Seal's never opened to Elijah back there did not Elijah how the revelation of the word for his age am I right then that's part of the word right have you ever noticed brother random about six times says that Daniel heard the Thunders and was forbidden to write it's five somewhere right in there times he said John heard the Thunders and was forbidden to write and brother Branham heard the Thunders and we have it now written to tell us what they are what are the Thunders brother Dale your Prophet said it about 158 of the seal book that's the old seal book he said the Thunder's the voice of God when the seal broke so now you said but yeah but but but I don't know Elijah this one brought to him he said God opened one of the seals and Elijah saw his name now I asked the question if our names is in the book we should have enough quotes to show that if it's in the book let's put on there before the foundation of the world everybody agree with that it is I'll try to bypass a bunch of quotes our names were written before the foundation of the world or they will not be written now come on come on folks you think well these dummies they don't understand anything they will be according to the church age book a future compilation of names after the world is over with and why throwing judgment so we not do that is I know those sarcastic ones are sitting out they don't know what they're talking about there's a compilation sometimes or whatever when he died I got that one listen Church is it just quotes to us now let me explain a little point if John according to the prophet had the virtues of the Statue of a perfect man all except the headstone now do you need them I'll be glad to get them for you if you don't reach natural perfect man you'll find it and then you none of those disciples had the headstone this love they had this down through here that's your prophet he said The Headstone hasn't come yet but yet they did from this Holy Spirit down and it was called the face of the fathers right all right John stood with the faith of the fathers he was capable of writing The Book of John then chosen to go to Patmos to write the Book of Revelation it must have been a very special guy chosen over all if you'll get into your Matthew Mark Luke and John you'll find that you're lying the ox a man the eagle will come totally compare with that that your Prophet has taught us so then the line would be Matthew the mark of the ox man the next and then the eagle John was the eagle of the Bible read your Bible he's more prophetic in his writing of the Book of John than the others are because he was a prophet he was chosen for that position he goes to Pat must to receive the revelation he asked the faith of the fathers he has everything that's been revealed and by then he had already heard of Paul and said under his ministry probably and he could probably say like was it Peter that Paul said things hard to be understood but yet he was chosen Paul wasn't chosen to go to Patmos John was because he was prophetic he could understand the symbols better all right but he goes down with the baptism of the Holy Ghost and when a proclamation comes forth it must be a redeemer don't you think he could give up and give him a great message on the Redeemer of Jesus Christ being God Almighty and human flesh no he was just straight and honest that would help you and I if we do it instead of being so super revelated to be straight and honest John says if there ain't somebody that can come and take this book All Is Lost he sure was rejoicing when he come to find out there was somebody worthy amen don't you think he could remember what he wrote in his own or at least one of the other writers wrote that when John the Baptist introduced Jesus and said to the Lamb of God to take away the sin of the world that you think he could stand forth and say Glory Hallelujah I know who that lamb is but there was something about that lamb that John didn't understand why do you need a lamb over here on the River Jordan and you didn't lamb in the end time to open the word why is it that lamb back there has only got one two horns and two eyes but this lamb that comes over in Revelations 5 he's got seven horns and seven eyes the prophet said he come from the church ages the church agency was Son of God folks This is 40 something years preaching this so don't think that I don't know what I'm talking about in Revelations 5 he's got seven horns and seven eyes that's that seed of the woman I kept trying to get to you the other day to show you that the Bride of Jesus Christ is so close to God in the end time until he does not separate himself from it and he declares her as being the bride and being the lamb we are him make manifests there is no Redemption outside of this message that doesn't mean people can't get saved out there they'll come to this as quick as they can all right but listen think about it it's not just it's the book that's sealed in heaven the mystery to seal is my name to our paragraph 299 I don't know I hope it is but if it is it was put on the book before the foundation of the world now that's your prophet you see folks what we've got to do is realize one thing as I said about Moses Moses was a pretty good leader but he wasn't the one God wanted do we put him out there 40 years to beat it out of him to where he could come back throw down his rod turns into a snake he just stands there Dennis and jambres comes up throws theirs down they turn them into snakes Moses oh I believe it I'm going back into the wilderness not exactly brother Randall said he knowed who he was he said he just said he just stood still he didn't know what was going to happen he just stood still sometimes folks you're going to get to you got yourself against the wall and you're gonna have to stand still you ain't gonna have all the screaming and hollering going on you're going to stand still and wait and just see what he says he just stood down and looked about that time that snake gobbled him two snakes up he reaches down picks up his stick was listening last night to the prophet he said where was them other two sticks he said that's in that stick the one Moses went down and smoked the water with the two old snakes are still in there had him captivated didn't you but listen you say it's my name there is my name there trying to cut it short have you heard God's voice calling you um right now get the point before we start if our names are not written in the lounge book of life before the foundation of the world and he can't call our name called it's not there remember it's not John Jim Charlie whatever that's our Earthly name that Mom and Daddy gave to us so is my name there if it is I got to find a way to see the key the key was one thing that I said a moment ago brother Branham in referencing to John and Elijah and people seeing their name he said when the seal broke and according to my Bible in the prophet's message the seals were broken in the end time now we know they were broke by Jesus Christ back under come on okay but it wasn't made known or revealed that would be what would be done in the end time now let's get just a second go over to number 13 brother in a hurry we'll drop over the others this is taken from the Third Exodus 1963 8 30. paragraph 309. now I pray for them Lord I pray that you will this hour by your Holy Spirit circumcise them Hearts take out all the things of the world circumcise their ears for they can hear plainly now notice and I check this to make sure look for they can hear plainly thee God's voice he didn't say they can hear plain of God's voice he said they can hear plainly the God's voice calling through his word and through the lighting of the day the revelation of the day right and Grant Lord that your eyes will be open that they may see the glory of God in this life's closing hour John didn't see his name until the seals broke as the sealed broke to you oh yes brother Dale I know all about the seals I know but according to Daniel 70 weeks brother around and said if you don't understand Daniel 70 weeks you can't understand the seals I send you Daniel 70 weeks book if you want to read it but yet everybody knows all about the seals white horse rider and this that and the other you know they know nothing about Daniel 70 weeks they don't need more to talk about it I didn't make that statement all right what about hearing his voice look at 14. which is a six seal 63 323 paragraph 280 256 excuse me yeah God said that down under the seals under the seals now there she was we find out he does that and he will do it and there everyone hated that away but the all that's got their names on The Book of Life God will call they'll hear it my sheep hear my voice that's why I read in John 10. Jesus said only thing we've got to do is make a sheep call ghosts don't know about it don't know it all right I think it's about time for us to make some cheap calls and you know you get around a bunch of sheeps and goats it's hard to tell the difference but a real Shepherd can tell he knows where there's a goat or a sheep Our Lives should prove what we are right oldest got their names on the book God will call they'll hear now with the background that I've brought remember John after the opening of the seals to John heard his name or knew it was there has gone through the opening of the word showed you and I the age that we're living even the world says we're in Lady of Sia the world says we're at an end right right everybody says we're at an end so are we just with everybody or has it been revealed to us what do you mean brother Dale it's not calling your name right it's the mystery of what's going on while you are here or while that name is being represented on Earth so Martin Luther God opened the seal to Martin Luther let him preach justification because the sealed had already broke by Jesus Christ back there two thousand years ago I don't mean that that it was John that Luther went to over and got the sealed and preached one two three four five six seven and understood to God hit now he's still a trinitarian but the revelation of the hour showed him his name in the book it was a revelation of this hour shown our name in the book the words it was written for the foundation of the world look at the last one number 16. Christ identified the same in all ages if you'll notice basically all the quotes today has been after 63 in case somebody would want to say I believe after 63. and they've all been out so look so we're trying to get ever Soul saved so that Jesus could come and he cannot come until that lice won that has the name of The Book of Life that was put down before the foundation world when that name is called now not just I'm not you the wrong but just say Mordecai so you were just born this I'm talking about salvation when we come to Salvation we can hear his name when we come to Salvation we begin to talk about his name when we come in Salvation keep growing in we begin to see our name written on the book right come on when that name is called that's Elias one of them he came to redeemed to bring back redeem is to bring back and when he brings the last one in he is sitting at the right hand of God to not doing his mutatorial work and when that life soul is saved that was redeemed and seen and knowed by God before the foundation of the world but that life soul is saved that closes the book then the lamb comes out takes the book out of the right hand of him that sets upon the throne then he's coming then he's coming to the Earth you see what I'm talking about that it's not Samuel Dale it's not James Cawley it's not Donnie far bush it's the hour that we're living then all names of the world is even listed in there of lady osia but not in the lounge book of life section only the redeemable are listed when that last name comes forth on Earth he's born again then the lamb can come brother random did the lamb lead The Mercy Seat in the 60s he said where's your get that out well yet that's a big Doctrine the lamb left of Mercy Seat in 63. then we've been under judgment ever since and remember under judgment nobody saved so where are you at what are we doing what is it to find your name in the book find the age you're living and see if you can believe it come on do you understand what I'm saying see if we can believe this prophet's message that's the only way we can find our name in the book is to believe the prophet's message for the end time because he's not another message to come to believe this message is finding my name I preached back there in 1906 79. and I said a person that comes to the opening of the seals is fully redeemed I still believe that today but you know I got a lot older since then I had a lot of problems that ain't got nothing to do with God's word when the seals break to you you're redeemed what do you think it's doing that's calling your name do you understand to believe this message to say this message is true not what's going around the garbage cans of the people of the messages and you've got to believe this you got to believe that you believe that that means you you're in if you believe my two Soul Doctrine those who know their God right the opening of the word is the calling of your name now let me do it right tired of this afternoon the revealing of the word is the calling of your name is it true that you were a sinner of course if you're like the people's messages no I never was a sinner I never was lost I always was eternal well then forget it but if you realize he was lost that means you was going One Direction just headed to hell right the new birth turned us around see John heard the Master's Call many times when he talked with him on on the earth in his ministry but you know John had enough in him to go up to the upper room and stay somebody said I think we got it let's leave somebody said we don't have what he said that's the way your Prophet said it John was represented there in the book in many ways but it had to be revealed to him on Patmos who he was and what he was doing don't you think it was something that that Prophet to come into the world believing that these was going to happen that was going to happen in the end time but one day God stopped him and said you are the man now you go because you're the one I called Moses fine doing good sit out there on the backside of the desert and teach her what was his name was it would you curse him with his name and what his name's son tonight I'm leader I'm I'm gonna take children out of each no I'm I'm going to take them out my mama told me what daddy when are we going but son we got away it's not exactly time ain't that our good excuse we asked God to heal us well maybe it's not time yet for him to heal me so I'll just do the best I can to like it Now where's your confession it ain't personal anybody in the Bible ever amounted to anything had something personal with God Joshua was standing out there today he's standing there looking he had done been commissioned by Moses he had done been ordained and done all the things that he walks out there one day and he looks over and out stands a man with a sword yeah I better run he grabs his sword and he went after him he said are you for us are you against us he said I'm neither one I come to take over right you want your prophet's words of that I didn't come to take side I come to take over now let's go into the Promised Land divided up it's about time you and I begin to believe Who We Are let's stand it's nearly 12 we just won't have no music we'll just sing if anybody has a need the order is open uh I love you I because he first love anybody have a need have you ever had a personal experience if you haven't then you don't know what God or what we're talking about father our brothers got a sick stomach messing him up Lord help me ache so we just condemned that the father is like a man said one day he said whether When you pray you believe he said if you didn't pray then after you get through it just pray again so we just pray again Lord sanctify that to our brother's body and take away the sickness that's in there and let everything be made whole because we believe your word in Jesus name anybody else he have you heard His Name the prophet said I'll read it this afternoon through the opening of these seals he didn't say no but today he didn't say call his name I look for that and I know it he said have you heard his voice through the opening of these seals you realize if you've heard his voice he's calling your name Revelation is something personal you can stand on it but mama's idea is fine but it's not a finish not enough Peter said I've been on the mountain I've been up on that mountain up there where the Lord come down but he said now I got a more sure word of Prophecy why because he had something inside of him right father we just lay our hands on our brother and our little sister believe in you that by your stripes they are healed and we thank you for it because we believe it your word is true you sent your word and healed us and delivered us from destruction we thank you for it in Jesus name anybody else before we go now remember this afternoon that it's just Rachel and then we'll be putting on a little program and things so they'll be up here working getting everything ready to do a little program this afternoon and all and just remember that okay father we thank you for this day and we love you and we ask you to just go with us now as we go eat a natural meal bring us back together Lord and you this afternoon and father may we see the end time message as it's going forward and by that you're our name being called calling us to a higher ground to where we can move on with you father we just thank you we know we commit everything to your hands and it'll all be taken care of because we believe you we love you father in Jesus name you dismissed hey the name of Jesus thank you
