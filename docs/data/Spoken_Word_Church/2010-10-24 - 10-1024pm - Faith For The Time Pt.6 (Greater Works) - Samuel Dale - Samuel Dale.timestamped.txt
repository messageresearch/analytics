[32:26] anymore i always forget something or
[32:29] mess it up on the wrong one month anyway
[32:33] we appreciate hebrews 6 and
[32:35] john 14.
[32:38] our precious lord and our savior our
[32:40] redeemer are all in all
[32:43] and jesus is your name
[32:45] thank you for the revelation of that
[32:47] name thank you for
[32:48] lord revealing yourself unto us
[32:51] because
[32:52] without you lord there would be nothing
[32:54] in us anyway we give all the honor the
[32:57] glory that all and all is to you
[33:00] truly you are our god and our savior
[33:03] and lord we do want to see you
[33:06] if moses could have thought in just a
[33:08] human mind
[33:11] without the new birth that he could
[33:12] think about wanting to see you how much
[33:15] more
[33:16] is it that your children want to see
[33:18] their father
[33:19] lord just come and manifest yourself
[33:21] among us and today through the word as
[33:24] we preach and heal the sick
[33:27] and lift up each and every one of us we
[33:29] love you and we thank you
[33:30] you've promised it so we believe you
[33:33] said you'd send your word and heal us
[33:35] so we believe you
[33:37] and lord just come on the sin now and
[33:39] have your way in jesus name
[33:42] amen
[33:44] hebrews
[33:46] 6
[33:49] therefore leaving the principles of the
[33:51] doctrine of christ let us go on unto
[33:53] perfection
[33:54] not laying again the foundation of
[33:56] repentance from dead works and of faith
[33:58] toward god
[34:00] of the doctrine of baptisms and of
[34:02] laying on of hands and of resurrection
[34:04] of the dead under eternal judgment
[34:07] and this will we do if god permit
[34:11] all right
[34:12] as i said this morning ended the
[34:14] services up i believe that god has
[34:17] permitted you and i
[34:20] the opening of the word or the word to
[34:22] be delivered into our hands by the
[34:25] prophet messenger
[34:27] and the holy spirit is here to
[34:30] quicken that word
[34:31] to make it alive in our hearts and line
[34:34] all right
[34:35] and we'll go to john 14
[34:38] and we'll read verse
[34:40] 11 and 12.
[34:44] believe me that i am in the father and
[34:46] the father in me
[34:48] or else believe me for the very works
[34:51] sake
[34:52] see they wouldn't didn't want to believe
[34:54] him but he said now listen
[34:55] you just check it out what's going on
[34:58] you know
[35:01] verily verily i say unto you he that
[35:04] believeth on me the works that i do
[35:06] shall he do also
[35:08] and greater works than these shall he do
[35:12] i don't know
[35:14] but look at the last part of that
[35:17] how is it that anyone could ever do any
[35:20] greater works
[35:23] than what he would do
[35:25] would have to be connected with the
[35:27] life's part
[35:28] right
[35:30] what is it now then and greater works
[35:32] than these shall he do
[35:35] because i go unto my father you may be
[35:39] seated the lord had his blessing
[35:41] to the reading of the word
[35:48] now
[35:49] i hope we can get through
[35:51] pretty fast this afternoon
[35:54] i have to do just some major reading and
[35:58] you know
[35:59] to get to a place
[36:01] but now we've been talking for a while
[36:04] about
[36:06] going on to perfection
[36:09] or going on to completion
[36:12] or finishing
[36:14] you know going
[36:15] on and not being satisfied with uh where
[36:19] we are
[36:21] but to always be
[36:23] constantly climbing
[36:25] to greater height and
[36:27] better understanding where would the
[36:29] world be if it had not went on
[36:32] in the natural understanding
[36:34] you know um
[36:36] i'm 70 years old but at the age of seven
[36:41] i was plowing a mule
[36:44] all day long in the field
[36:46] because
[36:47] we had to do that to make a living
[36:51] thank god that we have went on
[36:55] i remember the old truck that we had
[36:57] along about that time
[36:59] for some reason they had overloaded it
[37:01] and
[37:02] the uh
[37:04] right behind the bed
[37:06] between the bed and the cab with the old
[37:08] pickup truck
[37:09] they had overloaded it or something and
[37:11] it was just bent down
[37:13] and the front end stood up and the back
[37:15] end stood up and
[37:16] we all piled on to try to hold the back
[37:18] end down and i guess that just raised
[37:20] the front end that much higher but
[37:22] you know we've got the town
[37:24] i never didn't understand how the drive
[37:26] shaft was turning because
[37:28] it surely had been hitting something
[37:30] there
[37:31] but
[37:32] living in an old house that was called
[37:35] what was known in that day as a shotgun
[37:37] house and you hear brother ryan
[37:39] mentioned shotgun i don't know whether
[37:41] the kentucky way of it is the same as
[37:43] georgia but
[37:44] in that one you had the
[37:46] the kitchen and the eating area was on
[37:49] one side
[37:51] and then there was a big old porch
[37:54] in between
[37:55] and that porch was almost as much as
[37:58] this
[37:58] room across
[38:00] it had a bottom and it had a top
[38:04] but it didn't have any sides in it
[38:06] all right then on the other side of that
[38:08] was the sleeping area
[38:10] there was no
[38:12] heat
[38:12] whatsoever in the sleeping area
[38:16] they didn't believe in that they
[38:17] believed it would burn the house down
[38:19] they wanted it to be if there was any
[38:21] fire in the other end that you would at
[38:23] least have enough time to get out of
[38:24] this end all right but see we've come a
[38:27] long ways
[38:29] all right
[38:30] it's because that man didn't just sit
[38:32] down and say well
[38:34] we'll just be picking cotton the rest of
[38:37] her life
[38:38] and you know i i never could do that it
[38:40] hurt my back
[38:42] but uh i do anything in the world i go
[38:44] cut wood
[38:45] because the cutting of the wood and the
[38:47] gathering of the cotton fell in october
[38:48] and november so i would be glad to go
[38:51] cut wood any time to keep having to pick
[38:53] cotton
[38:55] but my point is if we hadn't went on
[38:57] where would we be
[38:59] all right and in the gospel if if we had
[39:02] not went on where would we be
[39:04] we would still be back in man's ideas
[39:07] and opinions and thoughts
[39:09] you know to
[39:10] uh of what the word is saying and and
[39:14] who's out who's right and
[39:16] what is right you know and
[39:18] well that's your opinion you know that's
[39:20] what they say
[39:21] but see thank god for
[39:24] sending us the word right
[39:27] and i believe as the prophet
[39:29] said i gave it back to you but i didn't
[39:31] mean for joe to put these in but in the
[39:34] questions and answers
[39:36] in 64 brought around and said we have
[39:38] the perfect
[39:39] interpretation
[39:41] of the word of god
[39:43] and i believe that
[39:45] i believe we have it in our possession
[39:48] brother dale do you understand all of
[39:51] the word i didn't say that
[39:53] but what has been revealed to me
[39:56] i understand right
[39:58] because it's been revealed amen
[40:01] it's been made known to me then there's
[40:03] things in there that that used to i
[40:05] pondered didn't you
[40:07] i wondered what it meant
[40:09] i wondered what would be here and what
[40:11] would be there you know
[40:13] and
[40:15] you know we just had our own ideas
[40:18] but thank god for
[40:20] sending us the truth
[40:22] and giving us as paul said
[40:24] that
[40:25] you know if god permits
[40:27] we'll go on to perfection
[40:30] well now down through time
[40:33] he didn't permit mankind to reach that
[40:35] position right because he had you and i
[40:37] wouldn't be here right
[40:39] but see now we have the opportunity
[40:42] to reach unto the perfection
[40:45] that is spoken of and and going on to
[40:48] the change of the body and
[40:50] the rapture
[40:51] and all like that you know you know i
[40:54] believe that we're in that time
[40:57] to where
[40:58] these that it can take place
[41:00] all right
[41:01] not setting dates or times and seasons
[41:03] that's never been worth nothing anyway
[41:06] but there's one thing about it we can't
[41:08] all believe we're in the end time
[41:10] so then we're here at that point right
[41:13] on that but now
[41:16] what i want to do now is try to maybe in
[41:19] a
[41:20] few messages
[41:21] uh i want to illustrate some
[41:24] to you and show you
[41:27] uh you know that we must go on
[41:30] in our understanding
[41:33] because if we don't we will as a prophet
[41:35] said
[41:36] cabbage down upon one thought
[41:40] or one way of seeing something all right
[41:43] whereas the the word will keep unfolding
[41:46] right
[41:47] and we will just stop on that and say
[41:50] well no no greater works now i know what
[41:52] that means you know
[41:54] well do you know all of the things
[41:57] that the prophet spoke of
[41:59] through the scriptures of the greater
[42:00] works you know
[42:03] and uh
[42:04] you say well this is what i believe it
[42:06] means well it's all right
[42:08] but if all doesn't tie together
[42:12] right
[42:14] see
[42:15] we don't have a surety
[42:18] you know we're not positive about things
[42:21] but see
[42:22] if we go home
[42:24] and let it unfold
[42:27] then we can come to a place to see that
[42:30] it has to be set this away
[42:34] in about
[42:36] at least four ways of looking at greater
[42:39] works
[42:41] we're gonna try to try to tie type
[42:43] together
[42:45] to see that
[42:46] it all must be saying the same thing
[42:49] but if not then we're making a
[42:51] contradiction
[42:53] all right
[42:54] see that's where people don't understand
[42:57] they say there's contradictions in the
[42:58] bible and you say well show me where
[42:59] they're at
[43:01] see we are the ones who make the
[43:02] contradictions
[43:05] if there is a god that's for your
[43:07] question not mine
[43:09] if there is a god and he can't keep his
[43:10] word straight
[43:13] well
[43:13] it's not much of a god
[43:15] you know we give us a totem pole do this
[43:17] is good
[43:18] but see i believe god has given us the
[43:21] word
[43:23] i believe and you say well what do you
[43:24] believe about this i believe the king
[43:26] james version is the correct version
[43:29] that we need
[43:30] i read other versions i love to compare
[43:33] i love to check out things to see if if
[43:36] the other writers
[43:38] will hold the same point about a topic
[43:41] you know i enjoy doing that when i come
[43:44] right back to the king james
[43:46] brother branham even said that the
[43:48] lonza
[43:50] bible
[43:51] was
[43:53] he said exactly in other words he said
[43:56] we can read it's in the church book part
[43:58] and it'll be exactly in in revelation
[44:02] but i can't read it i've got one
[44:04] and
[44:06] i can't
[44:07] read the two
[44:09] and seem to keep the same thought i've
[44:11] tried it sure you know i i know he could
[44:13] but
[44:14] see he was looking greater than i was
[44:16] looking right all right
[44:18] but see i believe then the king james
[44:20] version
[44:21] is the
[44:22] what was written in heaven before the
[44:24] foundation of the world
[44:26] you say oh boy you're getting on that
[44:27] now we can prove the king can't do this
[44:30] well go ahead
[44:31] prove all you want to
[44:34] because there's another point there that
[44:35] the prophet said we have
[44:37] the perfect interpretation with the
[44:39] divine vindication
[44:41] right
[44:43] around reggie came to any version and
[44:45] that's what he used
[44:46] and god vindicated
[44:49] he read other versions but god
[44:51] vindicated
[44:52] what was there all right
[44:54] so we don't have to worry about it i
[44:56] believe we have it the way it's supposed
[44:57] to be
[44:59] all right seeing that then they can't be
[45:01] contradictions
[45:02] right
[45:04] now we can look at it and see it
[45:08] but you know
[45:09] like i've always said about it
[45:12] you know paul truly believed in one true
[45:15] living god right
[45:17] but yet look at his talking
[45:21] he was speaking under scripture one day
[45:22] and he said
[45:23] the god and father of the lord jesus
[45:27] christ bless you all
[45:30] god and father of the lord jesus christ
[45:33] how many you got
[45:36] i mean you got about four there at least
[45:38] you know
[45:41] but yeah he wasn't a trinitarian
[45:44] and in no way was he
[45:46] making any statement
[45:48] that could be implied that there is a
[45:51] trinity
[45:54] but yet that took a revelation of one
[45:56] god
[45:58] or takes a revelation of one god
[46:01] to be able to see that it's not
[46:03] contradictory right
[46:06] you see like i said this morning
[46:09] brother brown said one day says let's
[46:11] stand together and address the third
[46:13] person of the trinity
[46:15] well
[46:16] he was really a trilateral
[46:19] see that
[46:21] you got one statement
[46:24] and yet you'll believe that statement
[46:26] above everything else
[46:29] that is said
[46:31] we see then what you do there is you
[46:33] prove you got the wrong interpretation
[46:36] and
[46:37] you make the contradiction
[46:39] god did
[46:42] you understand my point now right
[46:45] that's why i like to take anything
[46:48] i like to look at it from
[46:50] it is i don't mean low like low but
[46:54] partial realization
[46:57] you know
[46:58] to the very point of just beginning
[47:01] and then continue on
[47:03] to the
[47:05] highest apex could be reached to the
[47:07] thought
[47:09] in that way then
[47:11] but i'd be pretty close to right
[47:13] you know right if it'll all fit
[47:16] and that's just the way that i do like
[47:17] we're talking about uh therefore leaving
[47:20] the principal to doc here's paul with a
[47:22] new birth
[47:23] and he goes all the way till he speaks
[47:25] of the rapture of the church right right
[47:28] but see now
[47:30] john said
[47:32] jesus writing there in the scripture
[47:36] that
[47:39] greater works
[47:41] than ye
[47:43] greater works
[47:45] shall be
[47:46] shall ye do
[47:49] now what are the greater works
[47:52] okay
[47:54] now remember
[47:56] we can't
[47:57] isolate one thing
[48:01] and just stay with that point
[48:03] and say well i don't know about these
[48:05] other things well
[48:07] you know
[48:09] see we you remember in the series of the
[48:12] um
[48:14] seven compound names
[48:16] how that we could isolate one and say we
[48:18] need the savior more than anything else
[48:22] and we dwell only on that
[48:25] the within when you do you're leaving
[48:27] the other
[48:29] things
[48:30] that are as of same value to god right
[48:35] as the jehovah jihad
[48:37] the lord's provided sacrifice
[48:41] see now i hope that will hold on to us
[48:43] until we can can follow on you know and
[48:46] know the lord as the scripture says now
[48:49] but remember my point
[48:51] seal us into your mind
[48:54] while you're awake
[48:57] that jesus said
[48:59] the only way
[49:03] that the greater works can be done
[49:06] is because i go
[49:09] unto my father
[49:11] all right so now you see where we're
[49:13] putting the whole honor and glory
[49:15] on jesus christ
[49:18] so then it cannot be
[49:20] that you and i
[49:22] no matter what we think of the greater
[49:23] works
[49:26] it it won't be us doing it ourselves
[49:32] are you following me
[49:34] it'll be the holy spirit in us
[49:37] doing the works
[49:39] you won't be saying look what i done
[49:42] well you didn't do anything
[49:44] that's the best way to say it
[49:46] if you say look what i done then that
[49:47] means you didn't do anything because i
[49:49] got in the way
[49:51] now
[49:52] so keep that in mind seal that into your
[49:55] thoughts
[49:56] that no matter what we talk about
[49:59] it will have to be the fact
[50:02] that it can come to pass because
[50:05] he said i go under my father
[50:09] now so hold that in your mind okay so
[50:12] brother branham
[50:14] we depend upon you
[50:17] in your understanding
[50:19] how we could read our own thoughts and
[50:21] ideas and talk about greater works
[50:26] but what is greater works
[50:29] you know
[50:30] what is your thoughts upon the point
[50:33] to where
[50:34] that
[50:36] we can get an understanding
[50:38] all right
[50:39] and so let's read a little bit
[50:41] the message serves what time search we
[50:43] would see jesus
[50:45] 1957 11 12. number three on your notes
[50:51] now the fruits of christ
[50:53] when he's here on earth the things that
[50:55] he did when he was here on earth
[50:57] he promised that they would be done by
[50:59] his church after he left
[51:02] the works that i do
[51:04] so you do also
[51:06] greater works than this shall you do
[51:09] where i go to my father
[51:13] greater
[51:15] if anyone who knows greek knows that
[51:17] that word greater doesn't mean
[51:20] that it would be in quality
[51:24] it means in quantity
[51:28] in other words
[51:30] it would be
[51:32] more than this shall you do
[51:35] would be the way we would read it
[51:37] more than this shall you do for a go to
[51:39] my father
[51:41] greater because no one could do any
[51:43] greater work
[51:45] than he did because he raised the dead
[51:47] he stopped nature
[51:48] he done everything that could be done
[51:51] and he stopped the roaring sea made the
[51:53] winds to be still raised up the dead
[51:54] after they were done corrupted in the
[51:56] grave
[51:58] and no one could do greater in quality
[52:02] but being that his spirit would come
[52:04] into the church
[52:06] and reach out
[52:07] it would be a universal church
[52:09] all around the world and they could do
[52:12] more of the same things
[52:15] that he was doing
[52:17] all right now
[52:18] so where do we start from
[52:23] that we start from the basis of seeing
[52:25] that it
[52:26] it doesn't mean that we're going to do
[52:28] something greater
[52:31] right
[52:32] it means that we're going to do more
[52:34] right
[52:35] because
[52:37] we've got some of this in here but
[52:39] you know what he's saying
[52:42] that because
[52:45] he was limited to one body
[52:49] he was limited to being a human being
[52:53] no you say limited well
[52:56] the best way i can express
[52:58] the way that way is the fact that
[53:02] he done it himself
[53:04] okay
[53:05] now it's not that god cannot be all over
[53:09] the world
[53:12] it's not that he
[53:13] can't know everything not around the
[53:15] world
[53:17] it's not that he can't be on the moon
[53:21] or anywhere
[53:23] it's not that he can't do these great
[53:25] things
[53:26] but he didn't choose
[53:29] to do it that way
[53:31] all right so now you're listening to me
[53:35] so by coming down into human flesh
[53:41] he limited his own self
[53:44] to being in one place
[53:45] at one time
[53:47] right
[53:48] right
[53:49] now so then when the holy ghost would
[53:51] come onto that pentecost
[53:55] he would be dealing with
[53:57] there at one time was 120
[54:00] little christ
[54:02] like brother harris made a statement one
[54:04] time i enjoyed
[54:05] if he just left him alone he wouldn't
[54:07] have 120.
[54:10] you know well if he had left him only
[54:12] would have won
[54:14] himself
[54:15] but by crucifying him now you've got
[54:17] 120.
[54:19] then they go out to 3 000.
[54:22] and then it spreads to the world
[54:25] and all around the world today
[54:28] jesus christ
[54:30] can live in the heart
[54:32] of each individual person
[54:34] that is born again amen
[54:38] you agree
[54:39] every person around the world is born
[54:41] again jesus christ can live in here
[54:44] so did he
[54:45] is it us
[54:47] you follow me
[54:49] is it us
[54:51] or is it because he went to the father
[54:54] he hadn't went to the father he couldn't
[54:56] come back
[54:57] all right
[54:58] now
[55:00] so what's he doing
[55:03] he is all around the world and that's
[55:05] right in her
[55:08] doing what he couldn't do
[55:11] when it was here just in one human flesh
[55:13] right
[55:14] so
[55:15] the original translation says
[55:18] more
[55:20] not more in quality
[55:25] but more in quality right
[55:28] you know around the world so let's read
[55:29] a few things man
[55:31] you say well we understand that but
[55:32] let's read it
[55:33] to make sure everybody does
[55:36] the next one is then jesus came in
[55:38] 1957-1213
[55:41] and that he is leaving he said
[55:44] the works that i do shall you do also
[55:47] greater works than this shall you do
[55:49] and the word greater anyone knows means
[55:52] more
[55:53] you couldn't do any greater inequality
[55:55] just in quantity
[55:58] because he was there in one person
[56:01] god was re was represented in one person
[56:04] now he's represented in the universal
[56:06] church everywhere
[56:08] more than this you know you do before i
[56:10] go into my father need a little while
[56:12] see me no more he's gone out into the
[56:14] world
[56:15] into the bride of christ
[56:17] around the world
[56:21] a message called jesus christ was saying
[56:24] 1958 28 214
[56:28] he's talking about this and he said now
[56:29] the word there in the in king james says
[56:32] greater works than this will you do
[56:34] but if you'll run that back to the greek
[56:36] lexicon you'll find out that doesn't
[56:38] mean greater it means more
[56:41] you couldn't do greater
[56:43] he stopped nature heal the sick raise
[56:45] the dead done things well there could be
[56:48] no more done
[56:50] but you could do more of it
[56:53] because he would be in his church as the
[56:55] brains amen as the vine in his branches
[56:59] are
[57:00] whole world around the same
[57:02] okay
[57:03] you know in the next one
[57:06] uncertain sound 1960 12 18
[57:09] john 14 12 he said in the works that i
[57:11] do shall you do also and greater works
[57:13] and this year you do
[57:15] more of it
[57:16] the word there absolutely look in the
[57:18] greek and it says more shall you do
[57:20] because why
[57:21] he was he was just in one man now god is
[57:24] in his whole church you see god was in
[57:27] one man then all men who believe him now
[57:31] more than this shall you do for i go to
[57:33] my father i'll return back to the light
[57:35] that i was that led the children of
[57:37] israel through the wilderness
[57:41] all right one more perseverance 1962
[57:44] 520
[57:47] someone said now listen
[57:51] someone said
[57:57] oh sure
[57:59] we do greater works
[58:07] because
[58:10] we got a greater organization
[58:13] than he had
[58:15] we got greater
[58:17] we're all the way around the world
[58:20] now that's just what he said
[58:23] that he would be all around the world
[58:26] right
[58:28] but he didn't say
[58:30] an organization
[58:32] so now man interprets
[58:34] that of greater works
[58:40] and we certainly wouldn't agree with
[58:41] that
[58:43] that
[58:44] we got a a denomination an organization
[58:47] see
[58:49] he said
[58:50] we're all around the world wait a minute
[58:54] and watch him
[58:56] before you do that
[58:59] do the works he did first
[59:07] now what is to do the works of god
[59:10] john 6 and 29
[59:14] is to believe on the one that god sent
[59:18] well they definitely didn't believe on
[59:20] the one god sent it wouldn't be an
[59:21] organization
[59:23] all right
[59:24] and anytime you go out with your own
[59:26] idea remember what you're doing
[59:29] see
[59:32] you're not doing the
[59:34] works of god
[59:36] first off is to believe god
[59:38] now second off and i'll show you other
[59:40] times where brother branham was saying
[59:41] this if you want to
[59:43] just run in greater works in your
[59:44] computer and come up and give it to you
[59:45] okay
[59:48] and you'll find him talking a lot about
[59:50] people
[59:51] that will say uh and we have one here in
[59:54] a minute that they'll say that we uh
[59:56] preach the gospel around the world
[1:00:01] well that's what jesus said would take
[1:00:02] place
[1:00:04] the gospel would be preached around the
[1:00:06] world
[1:00:08] but not by an organization
[1:00:14] organization preaches their own concept
[1:00:20] i'm trying to show you how close it is
[1:00:25] that you go out and you say well well
[1:00:27] brother now
[1:00:29] when jesus died he went around the world
[1:00:31] and now you preach the gospel
[1:00:33] all around the world
[1:00:36] and an
[1:00:41] around organization world
[1:00:43] we're on the radio around the world we
[1:00:46] we've got more giveaway programs we got
[1:00:49] great things we build great schools we
[1:00:51] build um
[1:00:53] you know we build um
[1:00:55] homes for the children the elders and
[1:00:57] everything
[1:01:00] but
[1:01:03] it wasn't what jesus would talk about
[1:01:07] but i'm trying to get you see how close
[1:01:08] it is
[1:01:12] someone said we do greater words
[1:01:15] so before you do that
[1:01:18] do the works he did first
[1:01:20] and you can do the greater
[1:01:25] he said you do his works first
[1:01:28] and then go greater
[1:01:30] if you'll take the translation of that
[1:01:32] from the original it doesn't say greater
[1:01:33] it said more
[1:01:35] the same works and move more all the way
[1:01:39] around the world then you got it right
[1:01:42] yeah
[1:01:43] but there it is the unauthoritated
[1:01:48] daughter word
[1:01:50] now you see
[1:01:54] now brother branham one time makes a
[1:01:55] statement like this
[1:01:59] he said you talk about you preach the
[1:02:01] gospel around the world
[1:02:06] he said now
[1:02:07] you do the
[1:02:09] lesser works in other words
[1:02:11] do what jesus done first right
[1:02:16] and this is what he said
[1:02:19] he said come i'll give you the pulpit
[1:02:22] and let's see you do it
[1:02:25] nobody wouldn't get up because they knew
[1:02:27] what he was talking about right
[1:02:30] but yet he stood right there in midst of
[1:02:32] all the unbelief
[1:02:34] that those people could produce
[1:02:38] and said if i told you the truth
[1:02:41] let god come
[1:02:43] and back it up
[1:02:45] so it's not just
[1:02:47] the point as i said to believe on them
[1:02:49] that god has sent but that's the
[1:02:51] beginning of it too it goes all the way
[1:02:54] to
[1:02:55] signs and wonders taking place
[1:02:58] in god doing those things
[1:03:01] all right
[1:03:02] now then you know for a reality in your
[1:03:05] heart that the biggest portion of the
[1:03:07] world religious system doesn't believe
[1:03:09] in in signs and wonders
[1:03:12] they're just churches they they got
[1:03:14] we're talking the other night they got
[1:03:16] uh
[1:03:17] you can find just go in the
[1:03:19] telephone directory and and call up your
[1:03:21] churches and and you just tell them your
[1:03:24] problem and they got a re they got a
[1:03:26] group for that
[1:03:27] now i'm not saying anything right
[1:03:30] i didn't say nothing but a brown didn't
[1:03:32] say anything
[1:03:34] they got support groups for marriage and
[1:03:36] divorce problems they got support groups
[1:03:38] for the kids they got support groups for
[1:03:41] the divorcees they got support groups
[1:03:43] for the alcoholics they got support
[1:03:44] groups
[1:03:48] brother brown never said anything about
[1:03:50] it
[1:03:53] but he didn't call it the greater works
[1:03:57] they called it the greater works
[1:04:00] he called the greater works
[1:04:02] as being
[1:04:03] the spirit of jesus christ
[1:04:06] going around the world and never born
[1:04:08] again believer
[1:04:13] that's where people don't understand
[1:04:15] this they think we're against this
[1:04:17] church over here because of the work
[1:04:19] they do
[1:04:20] no way
[1:04:22] no way
[1:04:24] thank god they're there
[1:04:28] you know if those people wouldn't out
[1:04:30] there there'd be a lot of hungry babies
[1:04:33] it'll be a lot of starve to deaf kids
[1:04:37] thank god for all of that right
[1:04:42] but the truth comes back to ring in our
[1:04:44] ears
[1:04:46] is that that is not the greater works
[1:04:49] even though it sounds like
[1:04:53] that's what even jesus was saying
[1:04:55] that even brother adam was saying
[1:04:59] of being around the world
[1:05:01] so now are we starting out right
[1:05:06] see the greater works
[1:05:11] now
[1:05:20] so we lay it down as to being more
[1:05:26] around the world
[1:05:28] the gospel is being preached
[1:05:35] born again believers are living the word
[1:05:39] preaching the word
[1:05:41] carrying the word
[1:05:44] the little money that we send to the
[1:05:46] philippines
[1:05:47] those brothers nestor brother del monte
[1:05:50] and all of his brother rocky and those
[1:05:52] brothers and brother vernon and them
[1:05:54] they go into vietnam laos they go into
[1:05:57] places that
[1:05:58] uh you know that
[1:06:01] there's not even churches in some of
[1:06:03] those countries
[1:06:04] and they put their life on the line
[1:06:07] and you're a part of it because
[1:06:09] we send them a little money to
[1:06:11] to help them support you know just
[1:06:13] to be able to get across back
[1:06:16] but see you're a part of sending out the
[1:06:18] gospel
[1:06:20] you know right
[1:06:22] you're proud of them preaching the
[1:06:24] gospel
[1:06:25] out like that
[1:06:27] but now
[1:06:30] is that all there is to it he said well
[1:06:33] no brother dale because we know that uh
[1:06:35] we're supposed to get to imparting
[1:06:37] eternal life
[1:06:39] and that's right
[1:06:41] we'll get to it a minute so hold on
[1:06:44] but there's a little something goes in
[1:06:46] there first
[1:06:48] before you talk about imparting eternal
[1:06:50] life
[1:06:52] because remember now we'll get back and
[1:06:55] say this again
[1:06:56] the catholic church says they impart
[1:06:58] eternal life
[1:07:03] the baptist the methodist the
[1:07:05] presbyterian
[1:07:07] come on
[1:07:09] they say they impart eternal life
[1:07:14] let's take something that's got to fit
[1:07:15] in there to be able to understand
[1:07:17] because you can't just jump up to an
[1:07:19] important eternal life
[1:07:22] let's take something and just cover it
[1:07:25] and compare these things all right
[1:07:29] we can go around the world we can
[1:07:31] fulfill
[1:07:32] the more
[1:07:35] because we can preach the gospel around
[1:07:37] the world everybody understand that
[1:07:40] but look down at the next one on the
[1:07:46] which is number eight on your notes
[1:07:50] faithful abraham 1961-312
[1:07:53] where is the gods of balaam
[1:07:56] where is your critics where is your
[1:07:58] critic sage
[1:08:00] the holy spirit's not right
[1:08:02] come forth
[1:08:04] do the same thing
[1:08:06] you say well jesus said are greater than
[1:08:08] this
[1:08:11] you come do the works he done first
[1:08:15] and then we'll talk about the greater
[1:08:18] and i'll tell you what it is
[1:08:23] now what is the greater works and i'll
[1:08:25] tell you what it is
[1:08:28] listen
[1:08:29] jesus could not preach
[1:08:32] the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:08:35] right
[1:08:36] right
[1:08:38] i'm reading what your prophet said
[1:08:41] it hadn't come yet right
[1:08:45] that's the greater work
[1:08:49] we're doing
[1:08:54] but do the same works he did
[1:08:58] he said you would
[1:09:00] okay
[1:09:02] so that's where people come in now and
[1:09:04] i'll make this statement before we get
[1:09:05] into what we're talking about there
[1:09:08] people will say today you know where
[1:09:09] where's the signs and wonders that's
[1:09:12] what they're looking for
[1:09:15] where's the
[1:09:16] the works of god you know the signs and
[1:09:18] wonders
[1:09:21] and people even say i said it too they
[1:09:23] have more out in the denominational
[1:09:25] world a lot of times than we have here
[1:09:31] but i still don't say that we don't do
[1:09:33] the works of god
[1:09:34] in praying for the sick
[1:09:36] and the sick being healed and things
[1:09:38] happening the dead being raised
[1:09:40] the signs and wonders that has taken
[1:09:43] place among us
[1:09:45] you know of the word being spoken the
[1:09:47] different things
[1:09:49] now i want to see a whole lot more
[1:09:52] but if you deny what's already been what
[1:09:55] category does it put us in
[1:09:58] so if we say brother dale
[1:10:01] look they have more out there than we
[1:10:03] have here well why don't you go out
[1:10:04] there
[1:10:07] no problem
[1:10:10] if you think that's more of god you want
[1:10:12] to go with that
[1:10:17] we see you're too embarrassed a lot of
[1:10:19] times do it that way
[1:10:21] but that won't help nothing
[1:10:23] but see don't
[1:10:25] don't
[1:10:28] say then that
[1:10:30] when we ain't got it because we don't
[1:10:32] see signs and wonders
[1:10:36] i believe those things take place among
[1:10:38] us
[1:10:38] all the time
[1:10:40] that we could back up and stand here and
[1:10:42] talk about
[1:10:44] and the sick being healed the dead being
[1:10:46] raised the things that happened from
[1:10:49] this little group here
[1:10:53] and there would be no argument or
[1:10:54] shouldn't be with anyone
[1:10:56] that those things has taken place
[1:11:01] but now let's go along with this
[1:11:04] because your prophet made an outstanding
[1:11:07] statement there
[1:11:11] he called
[1:11:12] preaching the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:11:16] the greater works
[1:11:18] because he said jesus couldn't preach it
[1:11:23] now we're back on that thing again see
[1:11:26] it's not he couldn't preach it
[1:11:30] because he is the holy ghost right right
[1:11:33] it's not that he can't preach it but
[1:11:35] around say it not saying that he can't
[1:11:37] preach it
[1:11:39] it's just like what i said a moment ago
[1:11:42] now
[1:11:43] god could be all over the world
[1:11:49] but he chose to
[1:11:51] bring himself down into one person and
[1:11:54] limit his abilities
[1:11:58] until the church would come in to be
[1:12:01] amen it would take his same thing that
[1:12:04] he's doing right and take it to the
[1:12:06] world amen now keep that in your mind
[1:12:09] right all right
[1:12:11] that's why it takes me so long to preach
[1:12:13] the truth is the hardest thing in the
[1:12:14] world to preach
[1:12:17] it's easy to preach a lie
[1:12:19] i can just run across
[1:12:20] everybody shout glory hallelujah we
[1:12:22] enjoyed that
[1:12:24] you'd be alive
[1:12:26] hard to preach truth
[1:12:28] because you got to get people to
[1:12:30] thinking about what you're saying right
[1:12:35] so now
[1:12:38] it wasn't that jesus couldn't preach the
[1:12:40] holy ghost
[1:12:42] because he was the holy ghost
[1:12:45] right
[1:12:47] but he didn't choose to do it that way
[1:12:49] right
[1:12:54] he preached
[1:12:56] all of the bible
[1:13:01] come on
[1:13:02] let's see i i used to have the idea i
[1:13:04] don't mind telling you
[1:13:05] when i'm wrong i don't mind telling it
[1:13:07] at all
[1:13:08] i used to have the
[1:13:10] concept and it was partially true
[1:13:14] that
[1:13:18] you know jesus like who said
[1:13:22] he
[1:13:23] he can't preach the holy ghost
[1:13:29] see what my idea was
[1:13:32] that you and i could do something he
[1:13:34] couldn't do
[1:13:37] and there's a truth to that
[1:13:42] now listen to my point
[1:13:45] martin luther
[1:13:46] had the new birth
[1:13:48] amen
[1:13:51] but he didn't have the baptism of the
[1:13:53] holy ghost
[1:13:55] they come with a death pentecost
[1:13:59] in that way
[1:14:02] he had the new birth which was the
[1:14:03] baptism of the holy ghost
[1:14:10] but he get out of the holy ghost and
[1:14:11] fell on azusa street
[1:14:13] that's what your prophet said
[1:14:15] i'm i'm with him
[1:14:18] because he had a partial realization
[1:14:21] right and the holy ghost could only fall
[1:14:23] on the amount of word he had
[1:14:26] but it was the same holy ghost
[1:14:30] but it was just the way of doing it
[1:14:32] all right now the holy ghost would
[1:14:34] bottle up in that man
[1:14:37] we call jesus
[1:14:40] you agree
[1:14:44] see so the disciples could only preach
[1:14:46] what he
[1:14:48] allowed them to preach
[1:14:52] but on the day of pentecost
[1:14:55] they went out preaching
[1:14:58] the baptism in the holy ghost
[1:15:04] see it's not that god that jesus
[1:15:07] i'm not different around i'm trying to
[1:15:09] explain what he's saying
[1:15:13] he's the one we just read
[1:15:16] that jesus could not preach the baptism
[1:15:18] of the holy ghost
[1:15:19] it hasn't come yet right
[1:15:24] what is he saying
[1:15:27] the dispensation
[1:15:29] of the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:15:32] did not come
[1:15:33] until the day of pentecost right
[1:15:37] when jesus was here
[1:15:39] it was the dispensation of sonship
[1:15:43] in the basis of son of man
[1:15:47] now
[1:15:49] i'll be glad to show you this quote
[1:15:52] brother ryan said that's why when jesus
[1:15:54] said
[1:15:58] he said now you blaspheme
[1:16:02] right
[1:16:03] but he said
[1:16:05] it won't be accounted to you to do it to
[1:16:07] me
[1:16:09] right right
[1:16:10] you can speak a word against the son of
[1:16:12] man it'll be forgiven you
[1:16:14] the scripture
[1:16:16] but it said when the holy ghost has come
[1:16:18] oh
[1:16:19] that's right
[1:16:21] one word against it
[1:16:23] won't be forgiven in this world of the
[1:16:24] world to come
[1:16:26] so you see what it's doing it's going on
[1:16:28] the greater works
[1:16:32] god thinks more
[1:16:35] i don't have no education sorry
[1:16:37] but he thanks more of his pride
[1:16:41] than he does his own ministry
[1:16:45] what your prophet said he left something
[1:16:49] for her to do
[1:16:52] you know what
[1:16:53] he has something for her to do
[1:16:56] what she used to preach the gospel
[1:17:00] and under the dispensation of the son of
[1:17:02] man
[1:17:03] that he was there
[1:17:05] did you say something you say something
[1:17:07] about me
[1:17:08] i'll forgive you
[1:17:10] okay paul covering
[1:17:11] a sin
[1:17:14] we see when the holy ghost comes
[1:17:18] one word
[1:17:23] sorry
[1:17:25] so you can see what he's saying now
[1:17:29] jesus wasn't in the dispensation
[1:17:32] of the baptism in the holy ghost
[1:17:35] he was then the dispensation of redeemer
[1:17:39] right
[1:17:41] to die
[1:17:43] that the holy ghost could come
[1:17:46] what now do you understand it
[1:17:49] and then brother around there was one
[1:17:50] said these things
[1:17:54] now don't blame me because he said
[1:17:56] just try to understand look at the next
[1:17:58] one number nine on you know it's getting
[1:17:59] in the spirit
[1:18:01] 1961.
[1:18:07] now if you think of theology is the sign
[1:18:10] of the messiah of messiah
[1:18:13] and what if you think
[1:18:15] the theology is the sign of messiah
[1:18:18] and and that's and that's a greater sign
[1:18:21] than this
[1:18:22] jesus said it works and i do so you do
[1:18:24] also
[1:18:25] and you say preaching the gospel is the
[1:18:27] greater words
[1:18:30] all right
[1:18:31] then you come here and do the lesser
[1:18:33] works
[1:18:40] so we're right back here at all the
[1:18:41] other here's the platform help yourself
[1:18:45] come up here and go down through this
[1:18:46] prayer line
[1:18:48] and let the holy spirit move out in the
[1:18:50] audience there over you
[1:18:53] let me see you do them works
[1:18:56] and then preach the gospel
[1:18:59] then you do do
[1:19:01] a greater works
[1:19:04] jesus could not preach the baptism of
[1:19:06] the holy ghost
[1:19:08] because it has not yet come
[1:19:11] it's a greater works
[1:19:13] it certainly is
[1:19:16] the church is to preach the baptism of
[1:19:18] the holy spirit
[1:19:19] jesus said it was coming
[1:19:22] but the church has it and saying we got
[1:19:25] it
[1:19:26] and it's for you see
[1:19:28] so that was a greater
[1:19:30] that is true
[1:19:34] now what's the greater works
[1:19:37] now repeat again
[1:19:39] not that jesus couldn't
[1:19:42] be the holy ghost
[1:19:45] not that he couldn't be all over the
[1:19:46] world
[1:19:51] he limited himself
[1:19:53] to the place
[1:19:56] of
[1:19:58] bringing his bride into view
[1:20:02] to bring you an eye sister gail into
[1:20:04] view
[1:20:06] god would said it so in the word
[1:20:09] that even he
[1:20:12] couldn't preach the baptism of the holy
[1:20:13] spirit
[1:20:18] he'd leave it to you and i
[1:20:22] okay
[1:20:28] look at number 10 and we're being
[1:20:30] be not afraid in his eye 1960
[1:20:33] 305.
[1:20:35] i was talking to a fellow not long ago
[1:20:36] he said oh sure brother branham
[1:20:39] we preach the gospel all over the world
[1:20:41] that's greater works
[1:20:46] i said do the works then that he did
[1:20:48] then do the greater
[1:20:50] show me the works that he did right
[1:20:53] the works that i do shall you do also
[1:20:56] now here is where people as i said a
[1:20:59] moment ago
[1:21:00] they say oh you don't have nothing i
[1:21:02] don't have nothing
[1:21:04] ain't nothing going on
[1:21:06] i differ with you
[1:21:08] amen
[1:21:09] because somewhere
[1:21:11] around the world
[1:21:13] that's right amen
[1:21:16] the ministry of jesus christ this day
[1:21:19] is being displayed
[1:21:22] if it can't be displayed here
[1:21:25] or someone making that statement and
[1:21:28] it can't be displayed in your church or
[1:21:30] whatever
[1:21:32] then you know what it means
[1:21:34] it means like jesus had to take him
[1:21:36] outside to pray for him
[1:21:39] it means that the scripture is right
[1:21:41] when it says
[1:21:42] he couldn't do mighty works among them
[1:21:45] because of their unbelief
[1:21:48] now let's don't get tied up in unbelief
[1:21:51] right man
[1:21:52] heaven help our unbelief
[1:21:56] as i said
[1:21:58] if there's just one person somewhere
[1:22:00] around the world
[1:22:02] today
[1:22:03] that raises the dead that's the body of
[1:22:05] jesus christ
[1:22:07] you hear me
[1:22:09] if there's one person who's healed or
[1:22:11] sick anywhere in the world today that's
[1:22:13] fulfilling the ministry of jesus christ
[1:22:16] amen
[1:22:17] when i brought it out you're just making
[1:22:18] excuses because it ain't in you
[1:22:20] no
[1:22:26] people wouldn't say that if they knew my
[1:22:27] background
[1:22:29] and the things that has taken place here
[1:22:34] they wouldn't make that statement
[1:22:36] so then it's ignorance that you're doing
[1:22:38] it in
[1:22:39] because call me sometimes and i'll tell
[1:22:41] you about how
[1:22:42] the dead's been raised the stick's been
[1:22:44] healed
[1:22:47] the food has been
[1:22:50] multiplied the mighty wonderful works of
[1:22:53] god
[1:22:54] but it's been so small
[1:22:56] until
[1:22:58] people don't see it
[1:23:01] but do you understand what i'm saying
[1:23:04] forget whether it's little or whatever
[1:23:05] it is if there's one person around the
[1:23:07] world anywhere today and the sick is
[1:23:09] being healed that's jesus's ministry
[1:23:12] so get off of it see
[1:23:15] and get down asking god to help us
[1:23:18] watch
[1:23:23] next one number
[1:23:25] 11.
[1:23:28] revelation chapter 1 1960-1204
[1:23:32] he that believeth in me said
[1:23:34] saint john 14 7 he that believeth in me
[1:23:37] the works that i do shall he
[1:23:39] that i do shall he also
[1:23:41] do the same works the greater than this
[1:23:43] because christ cannot preach the baptism
[1:23:46] of the holy ghost
[1:23:49] would be greater
[1:23:53] he could not bring it to them
[1:23:56] jesus couldn't get the baptism in the
[1:23:58] holy ghost so not one person
[1:24:00] while he was alive
[1:24:03] uh we need to get the pepper
[1:24:06] okay
[1:24:08] someone was saying i need to take it and
[1:24:10] break the pepper open and grip it on my
[1:24:11] hands and go back to the audience and
[1:24:13] lay hands on everybody
[1:24:16] i'd probably wake you up
[1:24:17] okay
[1:24:18] listen
[1:24:22] jesus couldn't bring the holy ghost to
[1:24:24] him
[1:24:25] because christ christ cannot preach the
[1:24:27] baptism of the holy ghost would be
[1:24:29] greater
[1:24:30] he could not bring it to them
[1:24:32] because the holy ghost hadn't yet been
[1:24:34] given
[1:24:38] and when jesus came and sacrificed his
[1:24:40] life and the holy ghost returned
[1:24:42] then they could impart eternal life
[1:24:47] to the people right
[1:24:49] that's the greater
[1:24:53] now we're going to get on the eternal
[1:24:54] life
[1:24:56] let's read the rest of this but the
[1:24:58] signs and wonders jesus finally said in
[1:25:00] mark 16 go in into all the world and
[1:25:03] preach the gospel to every creature how
[1:25:04] far all the world how many ever creature
[1:25:08] long as the gospel is being preached
[1:25:10] these signs shall follow them that
[1:25:12] believe
[1:25:13] and when that becomes a revelation
[1:25:15] brother you're near the kingdom then on
[1:25:17] this rock i'll build my church and the
[1:25:19] gates of hell can't prevail
[1:25:21] you see
[1:25:24] we look at it
[1:25:27] and think that every born-again believer
[1:25:34] but you got statements like brother
[1:25:35] branham he said you may never lay your
[1:25:37] hand on someone
[1:25:39] and feel the surge of power run through
[1:25:41] your body and see him instantly healed
[1:25:45] that don't mean you don't pray for him
[1:25:48] that don't mean that you're not a
[1:25:52] christian because they remember the
[1:25:55] whole story was started
[1:25:57] the reason anything can be done in the
[1:25:59] body of christ is because jesus said i
[1:26:01] go to my father
[1:26:05] now let's talk about
[1:26:06] eternal life
[1:26:09] now we've uncovered two things
[1:26:12] we've done covered that it's more around
[1:26:14] the world we've done cover that
[1:26:18] the clock's covered
[1:26:21] done covered that it's
[1:26:24] that jesus couldn't preach the baptism
[1:26:26] and holy ghost
[1:26:29] because it hadn't come yet right
[1:26:32] but when it would come then
[1:26:36] see around the world
[1:26:38] the more that can be done by all around
[1:26:42] the world can only be done because
[1:26:46] now the holy ghost has been given
[1:26:50] the scripture said that the holy ghost
[1:26:52] couldn't be given because jesus hadn't
[1:26:53] been glorified
[1:26:55] that's where people would say today what
[1:26:57] do you mean they had the baptism in the
[1:26:58] holy ghost and the old testament well
[1:27:00] now that's contrary to the scripture
[1:27:02] right country brother brandon you take
[1:27:03] these quotes and leave them there
[1:27:06] to even just say see that jesus couldn't
[1:27:08] preach the baptism and all again
[1:27:11] why because the baptism of the holy
[1:27:13] ghost dispensation would start on the
[1:27:15] day of pentecost and in the bride of
[1:27:17] christ
[1:27:19] the greater works of god around the
[1:27:21] world by the preaching of the gospel
[1:27:23] amen
[1:27:25] could heal the sick
[1:27:26] raise the dead cast out devils
[1:27:29] by the preaching of the gospel
[1:27:31] okay
[1:27:32] now
[1:27:37] so look what your prophet went on to say
[1:27:41] that day on calvary
[1:27:42] 1969-25 now the reason that line is on
[1:27:45] there that means this is continual
[1:27:47] you know continual quote so just keep
[1:27:49] right on reading 12 and then we'll turn
[1:27:51] over the next page and go on this is a
[1:27:52] continual reading right from that day on
[1:27:55] calvary
[1:27:56] 1969-25 now notice the greater works was
[1:27:59] to have the power in the
[1:28:00] church
[1:28:02] not only to heal the sick
[1:28:04] by prayer cast out devils by prayer
[1:28:07] but to impart eternal life to believers
[1:28:13] now
[1:28:15] the catholic church believes that they
[1:28:16] impart eternal life
[1:28:19] they believe they forgive sins
[1:28:22] unless we tied together
[1:28:25] now what do you think about imparting
[1:28:27] eternal life
[1:28:30] well brother i'll just give it to you
[1:28:34] now according to my understanding of the
[1:28:36] bible
[1:28:37] there was a man i believe his name was
[1:28:39] simeon simon
[1:28:41] simon the sorcerer
[1:28:43] he
[1:28:44] offered money to the disciples
[1:28:50] he remembered the book of acts
[1:28:52] and what he wanted was the ability to be
[1:28:54] able to give people the holy ghost
[1:28:59] reach a scripture
[1:29:02] but they told him where he could go you
[1:29:03] know
[1:29:05] because it didn't work
[1:29:08] i just get a holy ghost who i want to
[1:29:11] now
[1:29:12] according to the last words we just read
[1:29:14] there
[1:29:17] doing parties oh let's see
[1:29:25] the holy ghost was coming and given to
[1:29:26] the hands of the church to impart life
[1:29:28] oh that's what calvary meant
[1:29:32] it took stop degraded men and women and
[1:29:34] lifted them into a place to be sons and
[1:29:36] daughters of god to heal the sick and to
[1:29:38] impart eternal life by giving the holy
[1:29:40] ghost to obedient
[1:29:42] believers
[1:29:46] not to just anybody
[1:29:48] to obedient believers
[1:29:51] men who once enlight
[1:29:53] men who once
[1:29:55] who were once unbelievers be made
[1:29:58] believers and impart spiritual eternal
[1:30:01] life
[1:30:03] now how can you impart eternal life
[1:30:10] well brother we just didn't party
[1:30:12] eternal life in our church we just we
[1:30:14] just lay hands on the party turn alive
[1:30:16] well impart guilt
[1:30:20] all right
[1:30:22] well paul said
[1:30:25] when part gifts
[1:30:30] just lay don't get none how'd he say it
[1:30:32] was done
[1:30:36] how did paul say
[1:30:37] imparting gifts was done
[1:30:40] to stir up the gift that was in you
[1:30:42] those gifts and callings are without
[1:30:43] repentance
[1:30:45] so you can't give somebody a gift right
[1:30:48] right
[1:30:50] right right
[1:30:52] you don't give them a gift
[1:30:54] you stir up the gift that's within them
[1:30:55] all right but yet we think and there's a
[1:30:57] lot of churches teaching and i don't
[1:30:58] mean the message necessarily
[1:31:01] they can just impart spiritual gifts
[1:31:04] come out here and i'll pray for you
[1:31:06] you'll be a prophet
[1:31:11] well you could all mix up around the
[1:31:12] country
[1:31:15] you can impart it only to
[1:31:18] obedient believers
[1:31:21] now
[1:31:26] keep on reading how much greater is it
[1:31:28] to say
[1:31:30] to this sick woman laying here
[1:31:32] i can pray a prayer of faith she'll be
[1:31:34] healed
[1:31:35] that's a great thing
[1:31:37] that's what he was doing then he died he
[1:31:40] prayed for him but said greater than
[1:31:42] this so you do i'm going to give you
[1:31:43] power
[1:31:44] not only to raise him up for a while but
[1:31:47] to give him eternal life
[1:31:49] which we will be eternal forever
[1:31:52] poor blind wretched people how do you
[1:31:54] miss that
[1:31:56] don't you see the greater thing you see
[1:31:58] what the greater thing is
[1:32:00] that's the greatest thing that could
[1:32:02] ever happen was to invite eternal life
[1:32:04] to people
[1:32:08] what is eternal life
[1:32:11] the life he lived
[1:32:12] the life that was in him impart that to
[1:32:14] others
[1:32:15] can a man do that
[1:32:19] a son of god can
[1:32:21] now we just flip the page okay
[1:32:24] whosoever jesus said whosoever sins you
[1:32:26] remit to them they're remitted whosoever
[1:32:29] sins you retain
[1:32:30] to them they're retained
[1:32:33] now how do you re remix them how you
[1:32:35] retain sin how do you give eternal life
[1:32:38] and how do you choose who to give it to
[1:32:46] now here's where the catholic church and
[1:32:47] many of the others made their big
[1:32:49] mistake they go out and say i forgive
[1:32:51] your sins
[1:32:52] that wasn't it
[1:32:54] how did they get sins forgiven in the
[1:32:56] bible
[1:32:58] peter answered that question on the day
[1:33:00] of pentecost
[1:33:01] they said what can we do to be saved
[1:33:05] right
[1:33:07] how can we get this that you all got
[1:33:10] right
[1:33:11] he laid down the prescription
[1:33:13] he told him what to do right he said
[1:33:15] repeat every one of you
[1:33:18] towards god and be baptized in the name
[1:33:20] of
[1:33:22] in jesus christ what for
[1:33:24] the remission of your sins
[1:33:26] there's the greater word amen
[1:33:32] amen
[1:33:33] by the preaching of the gospel
[1:33:40] is not that what he's saying
[1:33:42] by the preaching of the gospel right
[1:33:44] you can remit sins right
[1:33:48] by the preaching of the gospel you can
[1:33:50] impart eternal life right
[1:33:54] wordy
[1:33:55] where did eternal life come from
[1:34:00] on the day of pentecost
[1:34:02] i'm talking about downstairs though
[1:34:04] 120 received it because they'd heard the
[1:34:06] word
[1:34:08] but they went downstairs
[1:34:10] and they said men brother
[1:34:13] what can we do basically
[1:34:16] well all you got to do just believe me
[1:34:19] i'll give it to you
[1:34:22] no
[1:34:27] repent
[1:34:29] be baptized in the name of jesus christ
[1:34:32] for the remission of sins
[1:34:34] and you shall receive the gift of the
[1:34:35] holy ghost
[1:34:39] so now we're still tying it all back
[1:34:41] together we got one two three things
[1:34:45] and they're all tied to one thing
[1:34:48] jesus went away
[1:34:50] and jesus came back
[1:34:52] and jesus is doing in the church
[1:34:54] the same thing he's done when he's
[1:34:56] really
[1:34:56] amen
[1:34:58] now in his church
[1:35:07] well i thought i'd just give eternal
[1:35:09] life just anywhere i wanted to you know
[1:35:10] i just that's what i've tried my best to
[1:35:13] tell people don't do it
[1:35:16] people in this message they'll go out
[1:35:18] and explain marriage and divorce to
[1:35:20] a bunch of unbelievers
[1:35:24] don't do that
[1:35:26] it's not for them what do you mean
[1:35:30] i mean what the prophet said
[1:35:33] he said it's not for them
[1:35:36] he said it's only the believers in this
[1:35:38] message
[1:35:40] now you read the prophet's message
[1:35:42] marriage and divorce
[1:35:43] that's right amen
[1:35:45] it's not for everybody
[1:35:48] come in the message
[1:35:50] didn't receive the grace of marriage in
[1:35:52] the voice
[1:35:55] see you're getting them in by
[1:35:58] dangling something in front of them
[1:36:01] oh i can go over there and get my sins
[1:36:02] forgiven i can go over there and get
[1:36:04] eternal life oh glory
[1:36:08] dear people say they got the ability to
[1:36:09] impart eternal life
[1:36:12] the only way you can impart eternal life
[1:36:14] is the same way jesus did
[1:36:18] right
[1:36:19] did jesus give eternal life to everybody
[1:36:25] according to my understanding he never
[1:36:27] gave my eternal life to nobody
[1:36:30] now you come and show me he did
[1:36:34] but he was here in the world he never
[1:36:35] gave eternal life to anybody
[1:36:41] he had to be crucified
[1:36:43] where that eternal life could come out
[1:36:45] of him right
[1:36:47] to be able to go into somebody else
[1:36:50] is only done by the preaching of the
[1:36:52] word amen
[1:36:53] amen
[1:36:54] so
[1:36:56] it's so vital to see what that prophet
[1:36:58] said jesus couldn't preach the baptism
[1:37:00] and the holy ghost but the bride can and
[1:37:03] that's the greater works amen now as i
[1:37:05] said this morning
[1:37:06] christian park word won't do all of it
[1:37:09] preaching era won't do it right
[1:37:14] god can't quit an era right right
[1:37:19] it must be the truth that's preached
[1:37:22] you shall know the truth
[1:37:25] the truth then it shall set you free
[1:37:28] not part truth
[1:37:30] no
[1:37:33] well what are we doing
[1:37:37] he laid down the prescription he told
[1:37:39] him what to do he said repeat every one
[1:37:40] of you
[1:37:41] towards god and be baptized in the name
[1:37:43] of jesus christ what for the remission
[1:37:45] of your sins
[1:37:46] there's the greater works
[1:37:48] how many of you preachers this morning
[1:37:50] that we're still reading that day on
[1:37:51] calvary
[1:37:53] this morning how many of you listening
[1:37:54] to my word on magnetic tape are willing
[1:37:57] to go to calvary this morning and look
[1:37:59] what god did for you
[1:38:01] did there for you
[1:38:03] and forsake your denominational creeds
[1:38:05] and preach the gospel
[1:38:07] listen to it
[1:38:09] hallelujah he's in your lap now what are
[1:38:12] you going to do with it why
[1:38:14] repentance and remission of sins must be
[1:38:16] preached in his name
[1:38:18] to all the world beginning at jerusalem
[1:38:20] hallelujah there you are
[1:38:22] what does calvary mean to you
[1:38:24] what'd that day do to you
[1:38:27] did it stuff you out of some
[1:38:30] theology did it make you a stuffed shirt
[1:38:33] or did it make you a christian sort out
[1:38:35] hallelujah sin is remitted greater works
[1:38:38] than this shall you do you see where the
[1:38:41] use are
[1:38:43] don't you
[1:38:44] greater works than this remitting sins
[1:38:48] in the name of jesus christ
[1:38:51] but through creeds and denominations so
[1:38:53] forth it's bound you down to a place
[1:38:56] you're still flirting with the world
[1:39:03] so the catholic church can't forgive
[1:39:05] sins
[1:39:09] but neither can you and i
[1:39:11] unless the holy spirit comes on the
[1:39:12] scene in you and i to offer it right
[1:39:15] amen
[1:39:17] right
[1:39:19] once it's offered
[1:39:22] so where the preaching comes in
[1:39:25] the preaching comes in to offer the
[1:39:27] people the opportunity
[1:39:30] to receive eternal life
[1:39:32] all i'm trying to do is give away what
[1:39:34] god gave me years ago
[1:39:38] brother i've heard you say that many
[1:39:39] times that's right i'm trying to give
[1:39:41] away eternal life
[1:39:45] well give it to me brother
[1:39:49] we'll be through it a little bit that's
[1:39:50] right and the water's waiting that's
[1:39:52] right
[1:39:53] so come on down and repent
[1:39:56] and accept jesus christ and we'll go
[1:39:57] baptize you in the name of the lord
[1:39:59] jesus christ
[1:40:01] and it even connects to the remission of
[1:40:04] sins now the water baptism don't remit
[1:40:07] your sins
[1:40:09] it is your faith in god amen but if your
[1:40:12] faith is not right in god you can be
[1:40:14] baptized a thousand times right and it
[1:40:16] won't do you anyway
[1:40:22] hallelujah thank you let's go to the
[1:40:24] message now shalom
[1:40:34] 1964. let's pick up another point
[1:40:38] of greater works
[1:40:41] but remember now each one has got to be
[1:40:43] tied back together
[1:40:45] but we're going to pick up another point
[1:40:46] of greater works
[1:40:51] all right listen
[1:40:53] if i'm long i'm sorry forgive me
[1:40:56] i may have to go a little over because i
[1:40:57] got to finish this all right
[1:40:59] because it ain't something i can cut off
[1:41:01] and get the next
[1:41:03] shalom 1964-0119
[1:41:07] the word is light when it's vindicated
[1:41:11] until the word
[1:41:13] it
[1:41:14] that's
[1:41:15] promise for today is a vindicated
[1:41:18] then it's not light it cannot be
[1:41:22] if god said let there be light and no
[1:41:24] sun comes in existence there's no sign
[1:41:26] of light
[1:41:28] but when god said let there be light and
[1:41:30] there was light when god promised the
[1:41:31] messiah messiah come
[1:41:34] then he was
[1:41:35] then his word was fulfilled and he was
[1:41:37] the light of the hour when he promised
[1:41:39] noah and he promised the others and on
[1:41:41] down that was the line of the hour
[1:41:44] and there's a lot of the hour today
[1:41:47] that's jesus christ in the power of his
[1:41:49] resurrection
[1:41:51] his word that's promised for this day
[1:41:54] the works that i do shall you
[1:41:57] also greater than this will you do for a
[1:41:59] go to the father
[1:42:01] greater works
[1:42:03] greater things than he did
[1:42:07] he said you believe it
[1:42:10] i believe it
[1:42:12] he seems humble
[1:42:14] it seems like it goes over the head of
[1:42:18] top of people's head
[1:42:20] look when he was here on earth
[1:42:23] how could you do greater works i've
[1:42:25] translated that many times more
[1:42:28] but the same thing greater
[1:42:31] he said in saint john 14 12 it works
[1:42:34] greater works than this year you do
[1:42:37] did you notice
[1:42:38] now listen whitney
[1:42:42] he calls greater works
[1:42:45] did you notice
[1:42:47] when he went to make wine and water into
[1:42:49] wine
[1:42:50] he took water first
[1:42:52] already he already created substance and
[1:42:55] he turned it into wine
[1:42:57] when he fed five thousand people it took
[1:42:59] a fish
[1:43:00] that once swim in the water
[1:43:02] broke it handed it out
[1:43:04] multiplied creation
[1:43:06] he took bread that was once we baked it
[1:43:09] into bread broke it and hung it out to
[1:43:12] hand it out to the people and it
[1:43:14] returned back again multiplied creation
[1:43:18] but in the last days
[1:43:21] when there's no sign of creation
[1:43:25] he spoke it into creation yeah
[1:43:28] chose to flee the same god that was in
[1:43:31] the beginning
[1:43:33] he can create squirrels he can create
[1:43:35] whatever where he wants to because he's
[1:43:37] god
[1:43:38] greater things than this will you do for
[1:43:40] i go into my father the word's
[1:43:42] infallible and has to be manifested and
[1:43:45] has to be fulfilled
[1:43:46] greater than this shall you do
[1:43:49] not multiplying but speaking out
[1:43:52] but speaking out into creation right
[1:43:56] now you listen
[1:43:58] oh that was only for brother brown
[1:44:03] we'll read some
[1:44:04] more this is the continuation from
[1:44:08] reading a man here that can turn on the
[1:44:10] light 63 12 29 and it goes from page for
[1:44:14] paragraph 216 through paragraph 223.
[1:44:20] he said i want to ask you something that
[1:44:21] he's coming down and let it be personal
[1:44:23] though
[1:44:24] watch this see he's the same yesterday
[1:44:26] today and forever
[1:44:28] what
[1:44:29] his works that he did manifested itself
[1:44:32] now listen close when he stood there and
[1:44:34] say in john 14 12 he said the words that
[1:44:38] i do so you do also greater than this
[1:44:41] shall you do for are going to my father
[1:44:44] now he said it's heavens and earth will
[1:44:45] pass away but that word will never fail
[1:44:49] and if we're at the last end of the age
[1:44:52] where is them greater works going to
[1:44:55] come right
[1:44:59] see
[1:44:59] we're here we haven't gone
[1:45:02] he said now listen if the roman calendar
[1:45:04] is right we got about
[1:45:06] 36 years left every 2000 years the world
[1:45:10] meets her in
[1:45:12] first 2 000
[1:45:13] years destroyed by water second two
[1:45:15] thousand years christ came this is 1964
[1:45:19] coming up 36 years now the egyptian
[1:45:22] astronomy calendar say we're 17 years
[1:45:25] out at 17 years ag years advanced from
[1:45:28] that
[1:45:29] that would mean
[1:45:30] that would leave 19 years left
[1:45:33] jesus said the work will be cut short
[1:45:35] for the elect's sake or there be no
[1:45:37] flesh say where are we at the works that
[1:45:40] i do shall ye also
[1:45:42] same kind but greater sure you do now
[1:45:45] don't lose that because i read in
[1:45:46] between i just wanted to give you the
[1:45:48] continual reading go back to what you're
[1:45:50] saying up the top now we're at the end
[1:45:52] of the age where is them greater works
[1:45:54] going to come
[1:45:57] well we've been around the world preach
[1:45:59] the gospel right
[1:46:01] we've taken the gospel and been able to
[1:46:03] repent and get the people to repent and
[1:46:05] get them baptized
[1:46:07] and do greater works
[1:46:09] now look
[1:46:10] the greater work since the prophet is
[1:46:12] tying it together with what
[1:46:14] speaking of things into creation
[1:46:18] paragraph 2 20.
[1:46:20] now watch listen close
[1:46:22] go on your i pray that god will open
[1:46:24] your heart and your mind understanding
[1:46:26] though that you'll understand without
[1:46:28] saying it too much out much here
[1:46:30] notice he said one day let's get some of
[1:46:33] the great work he done
[1:46:34] let's just stop for a couple of things
[1:46:36] let's think one time he said you fed
[1:46:38] them
[1:46:39] you feed them something to eat they said
[1:46:41] we haven't done
[1:46:42] he said what do you got bring me what
[1:46:44] you got
[1:46:45] they said we have five barley loaves and
[1:46:47] two fishes he said bring them to me
[1:46:50] he took the original five party lows and
[1:46:52] began to break the loads
[1:46:54] and from the original he made bread that
[1:46:57] fed 5 000 is that right then he said
[1:47:00] have you got a fish
[1:47:01] gave me the fish
[1:47:02] it was a fish to begin with
[1:47:04] and he took off that fish another fish
[1:47:06] and another fish
[1:47:07] in bed 5000. is that right
[1:47:10] but in the last day
[1:47:13] he had nothing
[1:47:16] he just spoke and said
[1:47:18] say it'll be there
[1:47:20] and it was there without anything in it
[1:47:25] he never had a squirrel
[1:47:27] there was none there
[1:47:29] he said let there be
[1:47:30] there was
[1:47:32] his words infallible it has to be
[1:47:34] fulfilled
[1:47:36] i could tell you things that would shake
[1:47:37] you see
[1:47:39] it's there
[1:47:41] when he says it's dark
[1:47:43] let him say it
[1:47:44] just exactly
[1:47:46] see the east and the west here has come
[1:47:48] back and met the east
[1:47:50] see the east the west has come back and
[1:47:52] met the east
[1:47:55] it was moses
[1:47:59] even picked up sand and said let there
[1:48:01] be fleas
[1:48:02] and so forth like that upon the earth
[1:48:05] but in his last days he didn't take
[1:48:06] anything
[1:48:09] just a word
[1:48:10] let it be
[1:48:12] and it is
[1:48:13] what said that's the way it'll be
[1:48:16] i want to testify some of the things to
[1:48:18] not see
[1:48:19] that's what happened that you can see
[1:48:21] he's still god
[1:48:23] his word cannot these works that i do
[1:48:25] show you all
[1:48:26] to you also
[1:48:28] and greater than this how you do
[1:48:31] i took a fish made of fish
[1:48:34] you don't even have a fish
[1:48:36] you still god
[1:48:38] he's still the same son
[1:48:40] the same son of god that took a fish
[1:48:42] off of the fish
[1:48:44] he's the same son of god today
[1:48:47] these works shall i
[1:48:49] say these words that i do show you also
[1:48:52] even greater than this will you do
[1:48:54] it'll be magnified greater than this you
[1:48:57] do and the people refuse to see it
[1:49:00] greater works
[1:49:05] now
[1:49:07] keep this right listen
[1:49:12] your profit
[1:49:15] spoke the word right
[1:49:18] but whose words was that
[1:49:22] was it him or was it god
[1:49:26] all right now which one was it was it
[1:49:27] him
[1:49:28] or was it god
[1:49:31] all right now let's magnify it
[1:49:35] he spoke squirrels into existence
[1:49:44] but he imparted eternal life one day
[1:49:51] sister had the rights to boys
[1:49:58] they didn't repent and get baptized they
[1:49:59] did afterward
[1:50:05] but he said i give them eternal life
[1:50:17] he told brother dalton
[1:50:21] he said it's been spoken and all of your
[1:50:24] children to be saved
[1:50:29] it was magnified
[1:50:33] but who was it that done it
[1:50:38] remember the sister had it right
[1:50:41] she said brother brown may not but the
[1:50:43] truth
[1:50:47] he said something inside of him said
[1:50:49] tell her
[1:50:52] i asked what she wants
[1:50:57] it wasn't brother brown see
[1:51:01] he's just showing that god coming on the
[1:51:03] scene that we just read down through
[1:51:04] there
[1:51:06] and how he's going to do the greater
[1:51:08] works right
[1:51:13] that's right
[1:51:14] we believe it's for brother branham okay
[1:51:16] let's read number 13.
[1:51:18] amen
[1:51:20] message here you know 1963-13
[1:51:24] he talking about the robe of immortality
[1:51:26] showing that he had received him
[1:51:29] that's the thing that god will do to his
[1:51:30] sons here on earth
[1:51:32] someday
[1:51:33] he will call you a side church
[1:51:36] if you'll only obey him and stay on the
[1:51:38] word and believe it
[1:51:39] he will place into the church before the
[1:51:42] coming of jesus christ he will place
[1:51:44] into the church
[1:51:46] all the powers that christ had in him
[1:51:49] will be in the church
[1:51:51] all that god was he poured into jesus
[1:51:53] all that jesus was he
[1:51:56] poured into the church
[1:51:58] god wanted his work done
[1:52:01] he sent it into his son
[1:52:03] the son wanting the work done
[1:52:06] he sent it into the church
[1:52:09] and that day you'll know that i'm in the
[1:52:11] father father in me and i and you and
[1:52:13] you and me
[1:52:14] and that day because the same power of
[1:52:17] god
[1:52:18] was in jehovah god
[1:52:20] rested in jesus christ
[1:52:23] the same power that rested in jesus
[1:52:25] christ
[1:52:26] rest in the place sons
[1:52:28] in the body of christ on this
[1:52:32] placing of a son
[1:52:34] take him out of a certain place have a
[1:52:36] ceremony before angels
[1:52:38] and posses place in positioning what he
[1:52:41] is in the body of christ
[1:52:44] then that person has the authority
[1:52:47] let me say this
[1:52:49] if you kept me a fanatic from this night
[1:52:51] on
[1:52:52] that very same thing that i'm speaking
[1:52:54] on will be done
[1:52:56] there will be a power put into the
[1:52:58] church
[1:52:59] and now it's coming in
[1:53:01] that the holy spirit will so anoint the
[1:53:04] people that they'll speak the word and
[1:53:06] it'll create itself right there
[1:53:11] we haven't seen powers like coming into
[1:53:13] the church now i know it for a fact
[1:53:16] say this mountain be moved don't doubt
[1:53:18] any heart but believe what you've said
[1:53:21] shall come to pass you can now what you
[1:53:23] have said
[1:53:24] the placing of the church in position
[1:53:27] when the fullness of the power of the
[1:53:29] holy ghost comes into the church
[1:53:31] then critics mouths will be shut
[1:53:34] it'll be a short time
[1:53:36] jesus come right off the mountain went
[1:53:38] straight to calvary notice it won't last
[1:53:41] long
[1:53:42] but it'll be there
[1:53:45] people that can speak the word
[1:53:50] oh we can look back now there's the
[1:53:53] thing that i've been talking about
[1:53:56] the earth believing of the principle to
[1:53:58] the doctrine
[1:54:00] we can look back and see what brought
[1:54:02] around done
[1:54:04] and say that was the ministry of jesus
[1:54:05] christ
[1:54:08] right
[1:54:10] but you see we've got to leave that
[1:54:13] and go on to christ in the bride
[1:54:20] now
[1:54:23] see if you put it all in him
[1:54:27] that's your doctrine that's your your
[1:54:29] belief all right
[1:54:31] i just don't believe it
[1:54:34] but i believe all god was he poured into
[1:54:36] christ
[1:54:39] and all christ was he poured into the
[1:54:41] church it didn't say as some man said
[1:54:43] one time all god was he poured into
[1:54:46] christ all christ in the brother branham
[1:54:48] he died and took it with him we ain't
[1:54:49] got nothing
[1:54:52] well
[1:54:54] that's what you believe
[1:54:57] and i don't believe it
[1:55:00] i believe the greater works
[1:55:02] he's waiting on the bride of christ
[1:55:06] to not just heal the sick
[1:55:11] not just cast out devils
[1:55:16] but i believe it's left up to you and i
[1:55:19] just speak the word that's right
[1:55:23] you let this thing go for a little while
[1:55:25] and
[1:55:26] we all get hungry bellies
[1:55:32] you might begin to realize that we need
[1:55:33] to speak
[1:55:36] you may have to speak your next meal
[1:55:38] into existence
[1:55:48] but you see it's put into the
[1:55:50] hands now of the bride of christ
[1:55:54] it may be one out of georgia
[1:55:56] that means rest y'all got problems you
[1:55:58] gotta move states
[1:56:01] they ain't enough states for everybody
[1:56:03] to go to
[1:56:05] even though obama says there's 57 of
[1:56:07] them
[1:56:21] god's waiting on you and i
[1:56:23] adoption time
[1:56:25] that he can pour in his fullness am i
[1:56:27] quoting the prophet
[1:56:29] to raise the dead and we'll go in the
[1:56:31] rats right now
[1:56:33] i believe that
[1:56:37] now
[1:56:41] it could be that we come to where we can
[1:56:43] impart my brother branham
[1:56:45] no sister had it right said your
[1:56:46] children will be saved
[1:56:51] now brother brown said if you got the
[1:56:52] revelation for your own self
[1:56:55] why can't you believe it for somebody
[1:56:57] else right
[1:56:58] now here's the rest of that quote he
[1:57:00] said god if you don't have it for that
[1:57:02] way
[1:57:03] then i doubt you're saved
[1:57:05] now i'm paraphrasing that but it's close
[1:57:10] see we're selling ourselves short but
[1:57:12] not believing
[1:57:13] exactly right
[1:57:15] we're not believing in the greater works
[1:57:20] but the whole emphasis from 1 2 3
[1:57:23] four things or so that we've covered
[1:57:27] about the more to go into all the world
[1:57:30] about that jesus couldn't preach the
[1:57:31] baptism in the holy ghost but we could
[1:57:33] do the greater works and preach that
[1:57:35] holy ghost if it's in us
[1:57:37] right
[1:57:40] impart eternal life
[1:57:42] preach the gospel
[1:57:44] and let people see the word
[1:57:46] and it'll bring eternal life to them
[1:57:48] or even come down to speaking things
[1:57:50] into existence
[1:57:56] but you see what we do is we doubt
[1:58:00] we believe it was for brother branham
[1:58:02] we believe it was for jesus
[1:58:04] but we don't believe it was for us
[1:58:07] well according to my bible the whole
[1:58:09] world is waiting on you and i
[1:58:12] hebrews 11 40.
[1:58:14] may without us cannot be made perfect
[1:58:18] god's waiting on you and i amen to
[1:58:20] realize who we are that's right
[1:58:22] and that we can do the greater works
[1:58:24] let's see what he said
[1:58:29] look at number 16 you know
[1:58:32] phase 15 church age book
[1:58:35] and remember this christ in the true
[1:58:37] church is a continuation
[1:58:39] of the book of acts
[1:58:41] but the book of revelation shows
[1:58:43] how the antichrist spirit would come
[1:58:45] into the church
[1:58:46] and defile it
[1:58:48] making it look more formal and powerless
[1:58:52] it exposes satan
[1:58:54] revealing his works now what is the rew
[1:58:56] what is the works of satan
[1:58:59] attempted destruction of god's people
[1:59:02] and to decorate this deep discrediting
[1:59:05] of god's word
[1:59:09] otherwise i keep you from believe what
[1:59:10] the word says about you
[1:59:13] and the preachers in the land today we
[1:59:14] don't have to know these dudes
[1:59:16] be careful now
[1:59:18] get all confusing
[1:59:20] discrediting the word right listen
[1:59:23] right down to the time he's cast into
[1:59:25] the lake of fire he fights that he
[1:59:27] cannot stand it
[1:59:29] he knows that if the people get the true
[1:59:31] revelation
[1:59:33] of the true church
[1:59:36] and what she is
[1:59:40] and what she what she stands for
[1:59:45] and that she can do
[1:59:47] the greater works
[1:59:50] she will be an invincible army
[1:59:54] the word invincible means
[1:59:58] incapable
[1:59:59] of being conquered
[2:00:02] it's not invisible
[2:00:06] it's invincible
[2:00:08] you may pronounce that wrong but the
[2:00:09] definition is what
[2:00:12] incapable of being conquered
[2:00:14] overcome or subdued
[2:00:19] incapable of doing it
[2:00:21] you'll have to be an invincible army
[2:00:24] listen if they get a true revelation of
[2:00:27] the two spirits within the framework of
[2:00:29] the christian church
[2:00:31] and god by god's spirit discern and
[2:00:33] withstand the antichrist spirit
[2:00:35] satan will be powerless before her
[2:00:38] he will be as definitely courted
[2:00:41] today as when christ withstood his ever
[2:00:43] effort to gain power over him in the
[2:00:46] desert
[2:00:47] yes
[2:00:48] satan hates revelation
[2:00:50] but we love it
[2:00:51] with true revelation in their lives the
[2:00:54] gates of hell cannot prevail against us
[2:00:56] but we will prevail over them
[2:00:59] page 34 church age book
[2:01:02] may god begin by his spirit
[2:01:05] to give us continuous
[2:01:07] life-giving and prevailing revelation
[2:01:11] all if the church could only get a fresh
[2:01:14] revelation
[2:01:15] and become by it the living word
[2:01:18] manifest amen we will do the greater
[2:01:20] work and glorify our father in heaven
[2:01:24] amen
[2:01:25] now
[2:01:27] luther could take that and do the
[2:01:29] greater works and preach the gospel
[2:01:35] but he couldn't bring it out like it is
[2:01:36] today
[2:01:39] you and i in the end of all things
[2:01:42] come to a time of the age
[2:01:45] when
[2:01:46] we can believe it
[2:01:48] and god can make it manifest right all
[2:01:51] he wants somebody to do is believe it
[2:01:52] that's it
[2:01:54] he'll make it manifest that's right
[2:01:56] you just believe

[2:12:33] here five hours she drives down
[2:12:36] five hours she drives back home
[2:12:40] i told her i said sister

[2:12:45] family

[2:13:47] the floor you know unless jesus buried
[2:13:49] across alone
[2:13:50] converted
[2:13:52] her husband and i think it was two more
[2:13:54] men
[2:13:58] just by her being a christian
[2:14:03] listen we all have our problems
[2:14:06] there's nobody ever preached brother
[2:14:08] branham didn't preach that he lived in a
[2:14:10] glory hallelujah world that there was
[2:14:12] never no troubles he never preached
[2:14:14] nothing like that jesus never preached
[2:14:17] anything like that
[2:14:19] he had his ups and downs and problems in
[2:14:21] the world in life
[2:14:24] brother brown said he sat on a rock and
[2:14:25] grown with a headache
[2:14:27] after raising that little boy from the
[2:14:29] dead
[2:14:31] but wouldn't it be something he'd say i
[2:14:33] just don't feel like going to calvary
[2:14:35] today
[2:14:36] lord maybe another day i'll feel better

[2:14:53] something just
[2:14:55] to try to get away from not doing what
[2:14:57] you need to do
[2:14:58] until you make an excuse
[2:15:02] but that's not what it is go ahead
