========================================

foreign service foreign my holy holy you want to see him this morning turn around and Shake somebody's hands say God bless you you just looked right at him hey man you love the Lord good to be in the house of the Lord again good to be with each and every one of you we pray that uh you had a good week today will be a refreshing for you that the Lord will give you something for taking chew on and live by the rest of the week amen until the pastor gets back went down last night and had some service with him down there by the mark and I did and I did a wonderful job for him and he's down there this morning so the Lord bless him and be with him he's going to try to make it back to the second service but I probably won't make it back because they're probably going to feed him natural food afterwards so it's about a couple hour drive back up here so he said he was going to try to make it but but uh we won't look for him but uh he's here in spirit anyway we thank God for a good solid Pastor he did a real good job last night I told him I said I said your voice don't go right bad when you're lying he was he was doing some preaching wasn't he brought Mark I mean he was doing some some some screaming your voice doesn't do that down here something's wrong of course goes out when you hear something so let's pray for his voice amen a couple of announcements we need to make and this is per brother Dale for those of you that don't like for me to tell you something this is from Brother Dale his own he he put his stamp on this and Richard wrote it down on the phone this morning you'll notice outside and I think each and every one of you that came up here yesterday and put up those um gym sets outside so let's give them a hand made um food for him so they had something to eat so let's give them a big hand now here's the rules those things were about seven or eight thousand dollars so let's try to keep them at least on the rafter takes place they're not indestructible but they are pretty well made they're very actually they're very what made Brother Richard got online and really did a wonderful job finding the right gauge and the right you know where paint won't come off and and all that so Brother Richard did a good job in searching for these for these um things for the for the killers you know I'm telling brother Mark I thank God for for a church family right and I'm going to read something about that in just a second that I got off the internet but sister Monica's class and younger now listen to me maybe Joe can put this on the internet so we can look at it sister Monica's class and younger plays on the red blue and yellow playset Rachel sister Rachel's class and older on the green and brown playset reason being there's weight restrictions and weight limits and some of you parents can't keep your older kids off of some of them so we're going that's why we bought two sets that's exactly why we bought two different sets one is heavier Gates than the other one all right do the weight limit and older kids playing rougher all right if you wanted the kids to play together we would have gotten one place at so they're going to play in separate places all right now the older Sweden set we put down here it has baby swings in it for the little bitty baby so it's you know we got monkey bars we got swings something to keep the kids occupied between services all right now here's the Shocker parents watch your children you know I told brother Danny Sister George we were making a point downstairs and I want to make that point here you know parents until your kids leave your house you're their Holy Ghost that's right you are their Holy Ghost and you are responsible for what they do in your house you will be held accountable for what they do as long as they live with you know when they leave and go do their own thing there's nothing you can do right see it's not the parent it's not it's not the kid's job to get a haircut it's the parent's dog to make sure the kid gets there okay not the kids this is Parental delinquency we're talking about here brother Brown said that right he said that in the 60s what about now you're their Holy Ghost until they leave your house sorry mine were too I told my kids one time they said why can't we do this and that never I said because it's my hands and I wouldn't be mean I said I paid the bill I said if you'd like to make the house payment the car payment when I want food you go get it right right when my grand when my Gap my gas tank is empty I'm gonna come to you for gas money when I told them you can ask Josh when I told them they're like whoa I guess we'll do what you're saying see that's what constitutes having a home you're the father you bring in the money you raise the kids you give them money for food you give them money for gas but they're going to do what you say daddy told me one time he said I don't care if you're 30 years old if you put your feet under my table and you live here with me you're gonna do what I ask you today all right so same way with kids and regrettably I'll ask home so I didn't somehow all right now listen we still have kids going behind the storage buildings and going behind the big white fence beyond that fence is not our property that big long fence it goes back to parents watching your kids not somebody else's your kids all right now that's goes to another thing the seats in the back that say parents with children that needs to be because we're getting bigger folks we got to start putting some rules down to have we wish not it's not because we're picking on you but if you've got a child you need to be sitting back there in the back where those seats there on the you can read them on the side the deacons will be telling people if they don't have children they need to move up front okay now also this is an ongoing problem that brother Dale has addressed and so have I so the deacons are going to be enforcing this Nursery is for children with parents only no exceptions whatsoever we've got people that that is a cry room that's where people need to go and feed their kids that's when people need to go and change their diapers we don't need adults in there if you're sick you can sit in the pastor study if you're sick you can sit downstairs if you want to if you're an older adult no they're kids now I've been downstairs and some kids be roaming around you know can't do that but Nursery is for children with parents only only Dickens will be instructed to have you leave that room if you're caught in there okay everybody understand that this comes from brotherdale and we're here to enforce it he's already addressed that one time and you know if he addresses it two or three times you know what's going to happen he's going to really put his foot down so Monica's class red and blue and yellow playset Rachel's class green and brown brown playset all right that's due to weight limits and there's plenty to play man those things look really good really beautiful out there you go take a look at them in between services but um you love the Lord the Lord's good to us but you know what you say well you know what we got the Holy Ghost we don't know the Bible says you need deacons elders yes yes we need to be led we have to be led okay um you know Jesus told us he said the Good Shepherd looks after a sheep and that's what the pastor does here he looks after his sheep all right now I want to read you something here it's called a silent sermon a member of a certain Church who previously had been attending Services regularly stopped going after a few weeks the pastor decided to visit him it was a chilly evening the pastor found the man at home alone sitting before a blazing fire guessing the reason for his pastor's visit the man welcomed him led him to a comfortable chair near the fireplace and waited the pastor made himself at home but said nothing in the grave silence he contemplated the dance of the Flames around the burning logs after some minutes the pastor took the fire tongs carefully picked up a bright burning Ember and placed it to one side of the Hearth all alone then he sat back in his chair still silent the host washed all this in quiet contemplation as the one lone Embers flame flickered and diminished there was a momentary glow and then its fire was no more soon it was cold and dead not a word had been spoken since the initial greeting the pastor glanced at his watch and realized it was time to leave he slowly stood up picked up the cold dead Ember and placed it back in the middle of the fire immediately it began to Glow once more with the light and warmth of the burning coals around it as the pastor reached the door to leave his host said with a tear running on his cheek thank you so much for your visit and especially for that fiery sermon I will be back in church next Sunday you get what he's what he was talking about take the Amber out and put it out here it gets cold and dead put it back in amongst all the little licks of fire fire comes back us again so he said that was a good story and a good lesson if you have your Bible let's turn to the Book of Ezekiel 36 I'm going to read there we're going to also rather join them we're going to keep the we're going to keep the uh projector hot today because we're going to talk about a Christian's Journey now we've been through this before brother Dale's been through this several years ago but we got a lot of new ones and we want to kind of go through the life of a believer through the life of Abraham all right also I'd like to tell you that um we didn't get to go to brother Don's um a memorial service but we thank God for about four Brother Don he just sleepeth that's right he's asleep God preserved him God put him where nothing else can harm him anymore he's entered into the joy of the Lord but he's not in his complete state he's got to come back here and somebody's got to be alive to get him out and if we don't take this journey like Abraham did be nobody came right all right you know the the world has a what they call a bucket list everybody heard of a bucket list you know what that is we ever watched the movie you ever watch the movie The Bucket List what it is two old men they write down what they want to do before they die it's called a bucket list you put it in the bucket all right and they got out and said well I want to go to Paris I want to do this one to this well see I have a bucket left and it's called Jacob Fountain that's right Hannah Dale put your kids in there that's right that's my bucket list from now on that's right so the day we get out of here that's my bucket list I don't care about the things of the world I don't want to go to Paris I don't want to go to Rome I don't care about those things I want these kids saved I want them to save sanctify filled with the Holy Ghost Ashley call your bucket list call their name Daddy was preaching last night he said speak don't be silent speak the word and go forward speak the people's name go forward thank you Lord for that that's my bucket list from now if you had anybody want to ask me what's important to me those people in church that's right amen that ember to be glowing again in an environment where they can grow one of my bucket list is as I marked it off because Robbie and Bruce back so praise God for that that was on my list amen all right and also Richard and Katrina they've been on my mind for a long time and and you know what prayers of the Saints will bring them back amen sorry to keep your standing Ezekiel 36. let's pray before we get started dear heavenly father we pray today Lord that you would just come Among Us in a special way Lord be an active participant in the service you take these words Lord and as you see fit father and your will be done not my will that you would Lord just open our eyes Lord with Isaac and our ears to hear what you have to say father forgive us of our sins and our many mistakes that we make toward you Lord and the mistakes that we make toward others father that we truly want to be Sanctified in your sight father that we can walk as the Bible says boldly but toward the throne of grace asking any petition and that we will agree that you will make that come to pass so if there be any sick among us Lord you said you sent your word and healed them delivered them from destruction so as the word Goes Forth today may you heal may you deliver may you say in Souls father those names that were just called lord may you go now and and just touch the person Lord soften them up sweeten them up Lauren bring them back to you father give us our daily bread today Lord bless our pastor and be with him as he speaks Lord just continue to bless him and hold him up be with a little bride around the world Lord be with the missionaries be with each one here Lord it has a loved one that's lost that we may all Lord take that list Lord and hold it towards you Lord because the name means something father to call that name it means something but when I pray that you just bless the father in this service just be with us now in Jesus name we pray amen Ezekiel 36. amen you love the Lord I'll tell you what late the hours getting late get them in while we can Ezekiel 36. verse 24 for I will take you from among the Heathen praise the Lord praise the lord we got that here and we'll bring you into your own land now we got Promised Land right right amen which is what the baptism of the Holy Ghost then will I sprinkle clean water clean water not dirty water clean water upon you and you shall be clean from all your filthiness and from all your Idols while I cleanse you a new heart also will I give you and a new spirit will I put within you and I will take away the Stony heart out of your flesh and I will give you a heart of Flesh and I will look at all those I will nothing you've done and I will put my spirit within you and cause you to walk in my statutes and you shall keep my judgments and do them and look it Stephen says you shall dwell in the land that I give your fathers and you shall be my people and I will be your God we're going to talk about Father Abraham let's turn to Romans 8. verse 30. we're gonna read a lot of scriptures today but we're going to take our time we got two Services praise the Lord thank you Romans 8 verse 30. because I want you to get into your mind that when we talk today that if you're truly Justified now we know Abraham is a type of the believer but if you're truly Justified listen to what the Bible says moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called amen them he also called and whom he called then he also Justified because remember we're going to look today that Melchizedek met Abra Abram and justification yeah amen amen then he also Justified and whom he justified them he also glorify you may be seated in the Lord has blessed to the reading the word thank the Lord for each and every one of you coming today most of the time when the pastor is gone play hooky no hook you today now we're going to talk about Abrams Journey excuse me a moment I'm going to do my Deacon duty they said talk everybody's famous all right own air conditioning it's hot up here I'm already sweating down my back but I'm like I told him about man I'm just a hot natured person he said I'm going through menopause thanks buddy I thought we'd get you the code on you know just freezing to death and I've got the air conditioner on he's like what's wrong with you I said I'm hot he said you're going through menopause oh man demo was another one on the bucket list we can take that out Abram's Journey let's look at the first quote now most of you know these but we do have a lot of young ones that are here that really needs to know where they are brother Brown you said you can know where you are at any time with God right right by what not by what somebody tells you he said you would know where you are with God so God's got to speak to you sure he's going to speak to you through people the preachers through through the laity through the Elders of the church I I just don't believe that it's all the preacher's responsibility I believe elders and deacons and laity can talk together and grow in God yes all right so now let's read this quote here Hook from who's this Melchizedek and let's take it we're going to take it from attribute to us right now then we're going to late night aside and go into Abram's Journey notice now his attribute then the attribute was first God the thought the attribute itself all in one without being expressed then when he expressed secondarily he became then the word so there was God along with his thoughts before the eternal he had attributes right and and then God's thoughts are Eternal so when he thought of you and I when he thought of us it had to become word because he can't change his mind all right you and I can have a thought and we can dismiss it and you know go on and have another thought God can't have a new thought all right so the God's thoughts are Eternal then when he expressed secondarily he became then the word and then the word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us now we know that was Jesus Christ but remember God was in human flesh one time before that because of that all right I said we're going to be talking about the underlying meaning of this whole this whole sermon will be the man Melchizedek because he's without father mother he's without beginning or ending so if he was there with Abram and then he was there with Abraham and now he's here with you and I because Melchizedek became Jesus Christ that's right all right that's theophany now that actually walked and talk and looked at April is the same tiar from The Uber if you got the new birth right amen only one thing I've always said that's how people we can understand if you can't understand the Bible and understand this message then pray because with the new birth God is obligated that's right right obligated to show you the word amen he said he would he said I will come back as the comforter be with you even in you I will teach you things and show you things to come so he's obligated I know we have problems with the scriptures and we have problems with the message I'm not talking about that but if you're just like blank down and can't understand anything you need a new birth you need the new birth that's right because the new birth is the promise he promised he'd talk to you he promised he would give you these promises he promised Abram and Abraham same person but he promised them I'm gonna do it you're not gonna have anything to do with it sorry notice this is the beginning but before the eternal notice in the beginning was the word when the time began it was word but before it was word it was attribute a thought then it was expressed in the beginning was the expression the word now we're getting where Melchizedek is that's this mysterious person in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God when the word became flesh and dwelt Among Us hold that there now notice it's first being with Spirit God Supernatural all right the Grady Colonel second he began to form himself towards flesh and a theophany it's called the word a body this then is the state he was when he met Abraham was called Melchizedek he was in the form of theophany and I will get to that and prove it in a few minutes Lord will it now here's here's the uh uh quotes that I want us to see the next one we will scroll it up all right who is this 1965 now God at this stage of at this stage of his creation later formed into flesh Jesus we know that melchized it became Jesus Christ we know the flesh that Melchizedek had could not die for us so he had to come back in human flesh born of a woman because that's where all the trouble came all right but this was a grown man all right now God in this Stadium at this stage of his creation later formed into flesh Jesus from what from the great beginning Spirit then came down to the word bringing itself out the word doesn't yet make itself it's just spoken out in morphe later he becomes flesh Jesus mortal to taste death for all of us sinners when Abraham met him he was Melchizedek he unfolds here what all the attributes will do in the final end now what is an attribute a word word spoken now you and I were what attribute right right we came attribute straight to flesh then we become the word Jesus come from attribute word in the beginning with the word working with God and word was done right that's why he knew all things right he came to flesh to bring us to that attribute right to that word we we were born the word that's right we were born in sin shaken iniquity got all those quotes but we're not going to read all of them you ought to know that by now but he unfolds here what all the attributes will do in the final end now where are we who are we finally in talking about us right not talking about Luther away sleeping across not talking about two days ago three days ago amen all right he unfolds here what all the attributes were doing to finally live every son of Abraham every son of the faith will absolutely do the same thing what meat Melchizedek right just like Abraham did you're going to go through the same Journey that Abraham went through you're not gonna go around it we got to go through it all right because you know what a conqueror doesn't go around it a conqueror goes through it all right we're not here for a picnic we're here for a battle amen but I want to watch how we have to come also we see him revealed here Ruth and Boaz as a kid Redeemer how he had to come to be flesh all right just take that and hold it for just a minute so now let's turn to the Book of Genesis and let's go through we're gonna go through the life of Abram now Abram was called now keep this in the back of your mind remember we talked about the new heart the new spirit keep that in the back of your mind we're going to get to that we should be able to get to about sanctification before we break for lunch and then we'll come back and finish chapter 17 18 and all the way through there but chapter 12 we're going to the brothers have guided up here so so you won't have to flip through your Bible excuse me we're going to go through there you go for those of you that can't see well like me thank you brother Bob I think brother Bob's at the helm back there now isn't he yeah okay now and and brother Richard and all them man it's good to have a good team in it I mean it really is good to have a wonderful team now the Lord had said unto Abram now the word Abram means High father now brother Dale's already been through this but we got new people uh you know add to my bucket list is get everybody up to speed you know bring everybody in I don't want to leave anybody out now the Lord has sent unto Abram get me out of thy country in other words separate yourself Abram was what everyone was a gentile he wasn't a Jew he lived in her child days and he lived on his father remember the story is that his father was an idol maker that story goes but let's still worry about that but now look he was called out correct separate yourself get thee out of my country and from thy Kindred and from thy Father's House whoa separate from your natural family unto a land that I will show thee call now watch this verse 2 and I will make of the a great nation I will not Abram you're going to get so great you're going to do this yourself I will make a day a great nation and I will bless thee and make thy name great and thou shalt be a blessing now remember every son of the faith in the Final End you Shane daughter are going to go through this journey you're going to go through this exact Journey you're going to do just like Abram or or brother random was false and the Bible was false right all right so we start in justification so let everybody think justification and I will bless them that bless thee and curse him that curseth thee and in these shall all families of the earth be blessed right wow and Abrams away from what Abram did what God Said what a novel idea he just did what God told him to do amen right right and the Lord told Abram get thee out of this country separate yourself so Abram Departed as the Lord had spoken unto him and his mistake was he took a lot with him right but seeing justification you make a lot of mistakes I can tell you this because I went through it you want to be able to relate to that in justification you make a lot of mistakes why just because the unclean spirit's gone up you separated yourself for what you used to do right right right it's like brother Mark and I were talking last night but your old friends they're like a few more months just a few more months he'll be back he'll be back drinking his crown and ginger ale and he'll be back with a skull in his mouth he'll be yeah two three Ace probably went somewhere in a church and they got him all excited he'll be back you know Michael they see other people do that that's why they see their friends do that they see all the people of the world still going to church but smoking and drinking and doing the things of the world but I asked you guys one time and I didn't hear about the mark this but you know the same guy that held up the bear and said praise the Lord that I was saved that was kind of dumb the same guy the same guy he just they go to church and and everything's just hunky-dory but I I asked him I said well what'd you get saved from if saved means to be saved if you were in the water drowning and somebody reaches down and picked you up puts you in a boat they saved you from the situation that you were in right right man now far be it for you to jump back in the water but what did he do he saved you from one situation to another I said what do you save you from if you're still you smoked and drank and run around with women before right but watch Abram watch Abram's life now Abram I will make thee a great nation I will bless them that bless thee and curse him that curseth me remember those who he is truly Justified he is already glorified so if you're truly Justified today God is pleased with you not dwelling you yet but he's still pleased with you because he was pleased with Abram even Abram hi Father not father of many nations but see he knew Abraham was going to make it to the journey Abram was the one that didn't know he was going to make it to the journey that's right that's why we have to preach that's why brother Branham I pulled up quote yesterday where they said brother Brown well why do you even preach if this thing's you know signed sealed and delivered and God knows who will and who won't he says just like the story you cast in the net out in the water he said when you're casting that he said you get pollywogs you get snakes you get yes you get that he said but you get some fish but you don't know it yeah until you get the net in all right so that's what we're doing I just want to believe everybody say it or save a bowl right right and that was Abraham he thought he could help a lot right because he's still Abram Departed a lot went with it and Abram was 75 years old when he Departed out of haran now haran is a place that you don't want to be in we'll get to that in just a second so Abram departed what'd he do he accepted God called him and he accepted right that's your journey when your journey starts God calls you you accept yes Lord I'm sorry for what I did please forgive me for what I did baby form justification then okay forgive me and what did Abram do Abram accepted and then he what he walked the word haran means contention so he left all that contention he departed out of haran he left all that contention and Abram took Sarah and his wife not Sarah Sarah right here's why and a lot his brother's son and all their substance that they had gathered and the souls that they had gotten in haran and they went forth the going for the land of Canaan now justification is a type of the Holy Ghost right you say what Canaan is the promised land what's he doing in a Promised Land if you're Justified today you're heading to the promised land if you're truly Justified you're in the promised land you're right because if you're under God was pleased with Luther's justification right because that was the Holy Ghost for the time he's pleased with your justification if you're just Justified today if you just walked in the door and said God forgive me of my sins I am going to follow you I'm going to depart from all this contention I ain't leaving this place and I'm going if somebody pulled me up out of the boat I'm not gonna get back in the water now some do it's nice right that's the problem with people seeing they see somebody come to church several months later they kind of wander back into what they were doing before you know what I believe their stands were forgiven but they stopped stopped right Abram kept moving at least he went through different places and he and justification is kind of like it's kind of like trying something new because you're not used to it you're used to going in a store and pulling up a pack of beer and cigarettes or whatever and laying it on the counter and and doing like Mark said and you know your church was on Sunday watching football but man all that changed what you come out of that we come out of that we don't watch football on Sundays no more and not go to church right so something had to change Abram moved away from where he was but he went into the land of Canaan the promised land but remember he didn't stay in there he went away in and out justification is in and out in and out remember the outer Court the outer Court was all the way the doors were open and anybody can they call it actually the court of the Gentiles because even the Gentiles could walk in and out of that Court but once you get into the second chord can't do that only the Sanctified go to the second level so justification even brother Brandon you'll hear him on arabell he said justification he said if it's cloudy you're going to get rained on them but Sunny you're gonna get hot because there's no nothing to protect you you can go in and out but once you get into that next Bale there's a cover there's something to protect you amen okay now we're going to watch that with Abraham or April sorry if I say Abraham Mr slip of my tongue okay because he is now Abram he is not Abraham all right it's not Abraham you are not a son and daughter of God until you're born again you're going to get a name change so you're Abram you have troubles and struggles you're moving your your worrying you're taking baggage with you lot all right everybody okay all right now look and Abram verse six that Abram passed through the land unto the place oh them which means the back or shoulders of God pretty good place to be because you know what in justification you don't have a foundation so you need God that's why when you start walking in your faith you need to be like that ember you don't need to be separated you say oh brother you're just too legalistic the Bible I think about this other day and I read it in Romans the Bible says that I just maybe people don't believe like I believe maybe people don't believe this is the end time because the Bible says for Satan not the assembling yourself together and much more and much more and much more as the day approaches separate yourself and you do just like lot did because remember we're going to see lots separated himself from Abraham from Abram and he didn't do very well sure God blessed him and give him Earthly things look where he wound up you wind up in sin and Sodom right right they made me scream like this all right it just breaks my heart you know much more as a day approaches aren't we approaching the day yes amen we need each other people and to the plane of Mora and the Canaanites was then in the land and the Lord appeared under Abram see God's going to appear to you how have you been appear to you he may appear to you in a physical form he may appear to you in a dream or a vision he may appear to you in many forms but that's definitely one way he's going to appear to you and that's in the word that's right amen he's going to appear to you in the word because the word is the only place God is that's right all right now look what happened to Abram and April passed through the land into the place of chicken okay so I already read that story and the Lord appeared unto Abram and said unto thy seed will I give this land and they're building him altering to the Lord who appeared unto him and he removed from this into a mountain on the east of Bethel here we go what is Bethel Bethel means ah y'all can quote it by memory the house I'm going the house of God's bread to be specific the word Bethel means so see Abram starts his journey what's the first thing Robbie and Ruth started doing because you need to draw strength we know he's El Shady eye we know he's the breasted one but he only appears as the breasted one when Abram is beginning in his walk as he's in the new birth right but remember that Melchizedek Melchizedek is high priest look up Highbury we don't have time but Melchizedek Matt Abram and giving communion in his walk of justification if you're truly Justified you're on your way to being glorified if you're truly Justified the Bible says you're already glorified you just don't know yet but when are we going to realize they were there listening he removed from this into a mountain on the east of Bethel and pitched his tent having Bethel on the west and high on the east and they're building an open to the Lord and called upon the name of the Lord and Abram journeyed going where um Abram was moving God is always moving he never sits still God is always moving so Abram journeyed going on still toward the South and there was a famine in the land that Abram went down into Egypt Egypt is a type of what the world because you're still in justification you've still got the world has got that attachment remember justification is the man picks up the dirty jar the jar is still dirty right but at least the man picked it up from the situation that it was in called saves he picks the jar up and he's got it in his hand right still dirty on the inside and the outside right nothing has changed except the position that it was in man but see that man didn't just pick that man just didn't pick that jar up to throw it away that man picked that jar up to use it even in justification he had a thought in his mind he had an attribute but that jar is going to be used for something right I'm going to use this I'm not going to just chunk it out I'm gonna use it why did he pick it out for if he wasn't going to use it God Don't Make Mistakes oh this may be simple but I sure wasn't it came to pass when he was come near to enter into Egypt that he sent unto Sarah his wife behold now I know that thou art a fair woman to look upon now we know what happened we don't have to read this whole thing but I want you to remember one thing this is Abram and Sarah not Abraham and Sarah this is Abram and Sarah in justification in a title because he goes down to Egypt meets pharaoh Pharaoh wants to manage his wife in other words okay it's fair to look punks you're still pretty old she's about 60 something but listen we're going to see that Abraham and Sarah did this later but I want you to watch the difference in justification God what I just saw this this morning the Lord plagued Pharaoh in his house with great plagues because of Sarah Sarah Abram's wife and Pharaoh called Abram and said what is this the thou has done to me why not thou not tell me about she was thy wife verse 19 if you want to skip on through that brother when I say is thou she is my sister he still is you're still deceptible to some lying when you're Justified to save your height that's what Abram did but now watch and Pharaoh commanded his people concerning him and they sent him away and his wife and all that he had now watch when Abraham and Sarah does this same situation God comes on the scene instead of bimlet you got a problem and this man is going to have to pray for you to restore your kingdom now brother dating in justification he didn't do that next don't get that Russian Abram was in the position Abram was in was here in justification God was looking after him but God didn't come on the scene and say hey you touch that woman everything's gone because he was not Abraham and Sarah listen God's Gonna respect your person but I'm gonna promise you one thing if you're his child he treats you different amen amen now come on people he's a father he treats you different be protected Abram and Sarai to a degree because Pharaoh said hey I found this out get out of here and take everything with you that's right but buddy he told a biblings he said if you touch that woman you're a dead man he didn't say that in justification right watch how God the whole thing I want you to watch is how Abram and God and watch how they come closer yeah because it's a journey I know God but see God's still moving God's one moving God's moving got some stainless steel watch them come closer and closer if you don't see that in your journey then God's still here and you're still here and Pharrell commanded his people concerning they sent him away in his wife and all that he had Pharaoh they won't have nothing to do with this guy in other words he took all the blessing good now Abram verse 13. went out of Egypt he and his wife and all that he had and a lot with him here he goes again with a lot looking with him and he went on his journey from the south even to Bethel now he goes back to church again until the place where his tent had been at the beginning go to church justification you've heard me many times even even when you were born again when you're you babe in Christ you're a legalist right one more time you were a legalist right right man it's all news and dogs her dress is a little well she might not have been here for two weeks knew in the message you know you don't have a lot of Grace but you know what as you progress you get a lot more grace all right now watch billing chapter 13. We're not gonna go to Hebrews just a second if you don't mind we'll wait I forgot to read that one but look when God made a promise when he made that promise in Hebrews he could swear by no other so what'd he say I will I will I will remember this is an unconditional Covenant I will Abram Adam if you do this and don't do this see what I'm talking about justification is more like you do this you you're doing some don'ts now I'm not saying that you live any way you want to right if you do then you don't have God that's right you not only journey toward God that's right man you're not going to Bethel you're not going to Canyon you journey in like lot you're going towards China all right and that place got burned up right all right let's catch back up only at verse one and Abram went out of Egypt he and his wife and all that he had and locked with him into the South and Abram was very rich in cattle and silver and gold see God's still going to bless you in justification because true justification let me say that one more time God is pleased to walk with you in justification all the mistakes you make and all the blunders and all the the things that you do that that are not right he knows that we're human because he was a human one time the Bible said he became perfect and learned by the things he suffered right all right and being made perfect you understand yes all right now they went on his journey verse three he went on his journeys from the south even to Bethel until the place where his tent had been at the beginning between Bethel and high until the place of the altar which he had made there at first and there Abram called on the name of the Lord now in justification what becomes evident in justification like brother Mark and I were talking have you noticed have you noticed all these new churches they're called worship sinners right yep that's right who's the worship angel that damn off that's good brother amen we're not Baptist anymore had a friend of mine who still works at Victory food good Christian boy as far as he knows he lived the best he can but he came up to me one day and told me he said we worship so long this is the Baptist we worship so long the preacher didn't even get to preach now have you ever heard that before we thought the Pentecostals only did that now the Baptists are doing it but I was telling Brother Martin he said yeah you're right you look it's not the First Baptist Church in gilsville anymore right it's the Worship Center yields The Worship Center or what Gainesville Worship Center all these worship centers and and I like this one new age seen that one new age you see what Satan's doing yeah he's doing away with names he's doing away with any kind of name he wants you to worship Satan with love for you to just worship there's nothing wrong with worship right right okay but if that's all you do you're out that's right and that's all they do they just worship they know to worship and cry and and you know mother made it so so maybe I made it or hoped to but but now watch Abram Abram called on the name of the Lord justification we need to realize there's a name like remember the Marvel the reason I'm saying this he and I spent two hours going to going to listen to Dad last night and two hours back home so we had a good four hour conversation with each other that we usually hadn't got hadn't done in a long time so thank God for that right a lot of you missed out brother Mark said if we had a band for a week and a talk like this I said yeah I know especially the ones that we're going with us foreign but we do win listen what do they say now they say and and Philip's the same way that the brother the the Victor Foods he said God God I hardly ever say Jesus that's right hardly ever say Jesus Christ God is going to do God this could be your God nobody's got a name yes his name's Lord Jesus Christ amen and they don't like that name or they'd be baptized in it Paul's not a name son is not a name Holy Ghost is not a name worship sin is not a name amen that's right we got to be identified all that we do in word indeed doing the name of Jesus Christ they don't do that they'll say in God's name they won't call his name or they'll say for Christ's sake against that they don't pray for Christ's sake I mean you get mad at somebody and you say that Christ's sake man quit doing that you know the world does that we should do that I'm sorry I shouldn't have done that but you know what they're afraid of that name but Abram's not Abram called on the name of the Lord now he didn't say Lord Jesus Christ he didn't know that but you do you do you know you knew when you become Justified and you at least come to this church you knew there was a name you had to come under to be identified with God right because God's name is the Lord Jesus Christ amen so in justification watch how God is coming closer he's revealing his name I know some of you had problems with that some of you didn't but you had to come to a realization that the only way to move with God is to be baptized in that name Amen to be identified you know what I'm Adele I'm a son I'm Grandpa I'm pawpaw but I got a name and that anybody can be a popo it might be a daddy there's only one same way down the second that identifies everything toward me right so that's the same way with the Lord Jesus Christ that identifies that's why the world is pushing that name out you know what they say well yeah we believe in that name but they can't stand it right that's why brother Bram said father son Holy Ghost baptism come from the pits of hell because Satan slipped that in on the people right and had them baptized in that title to do away with the name Satan wants to do away with that and he hates that name he hates the name Jesus Christ right and he's my Lord but Abram had a revelation in verse 4. he called on the name of the Lord and a lot also which went with Abram had flocks and hurt intense so you know God blessed a blessed lot too and the lamb was not able to Bear them God blessed them so much to him man that was eating all the grass right and eating all the leaves off the trees and the lamb was not able to Bear them the team might dwell together for their substance was great so they could not dwell together and there was a Strife now look there wasn't a strike between Abram and lot it was a strike between Abram's church members and lots church members that's right herdsman right between the herdmen of Evans cattle and Herdman locks cattle and the Canaanites and the purgicide dwelled in in the land in other words the land was getting kind of full and everyone said a lot let there be no Strife I pray thee between me and me and between my herdmen and I heard me before we be brethren we can learn a lot right there it's not the whole land before they separate thyself I pray thee from me is thou will take a left hand and I will go to the right now what did he do he gave light he gave a lot the option Abram didn't look over here because you know what what did God promise Abram Abram didn't forget what God Said he said I'm gonna give you part of the Lamb right remember back I will I will bless thee multiply them give you everything right all the families in heaven and I will go to the way and lot lifted up his eyes and I'm sure he probably beheld the planes of Jordan now what is that it was watered it was probably greener than the rest it's a lot probably not being a believer to a degree that that burn was that it was well watered everywhere before the Lord destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah even as the garden of the Lord in other words the Garden of Eden this was like going to beating and this didn't like the land of Egypt as thou cometh into the door they light chose him all the plains of Jordan now listen Abram didn't jump up and down and scream why'd you do that oh look they separated himself one from the other right Abram dwelled in the land of Canaan that's where he was supposed to be in the first place that was the Promised Land and lot dwelled in the cities of the plain but his problem was his attitude was toward the world he pitched his tent towards Sodom what'd he do if he looked he saw son all right but the man of thought were Wicked in Sinners before the Lord exceedingly and the Lord said unto Abram after that lot was separated God began to talk thank you Ryan you had one little thing you got to get out every one of us today even I don't care if you follow the Holy Ghost they steal remember justification goes higher and higher there's things that we got attached to us that we got to separate from all of us after that lot was separated from him lift up thine eyes and look from the place where thou art now look took a certain area right right over here yes Abram went over here now watch what God he's promised Abel look from the place where thou art northward Southward Eastward and westward in other words even right over there where lot was for all the land which thou seeest could thee will I give it and to thy seed forever ask God's children God's promises are true people there's nothing in this world there's no drug there's no there's no picture there's no um ball team there's no great big deer there's no nothing that'll give you this God said I'll give my children looks right here nobody else this right here and I will make thy seed as the Dutch of the earth so that the man can number the dust of the earth and shall not see it also be numbered arise walk through the land and the length of it and the breath of it for I will give it unto thee Brothers said Footprints means possession right everywhere you walk everywhere you walk church we are what we are given to be possessors of this Earth that's right I thought we were going to come back as kings and preach and Rule and Reign Over the all right all right then Abram removed his tent and came and dwelled in the planes of mammary which is in Hebron and Hebron means the seed of Association so he's bringing everything together and built there and altering to the Lord look at Abram watch him he's making sacrifices in justification you say well no sanctification is a in the blood I know that but don't you make don't you make sacrifices in justification you sacrifice there's a lot of things we sacrifice come on people when sometimes we say this is justification and we put it in a block over here and then we'll say well this is sanctification and we put it right here no it's all mixed together right all these all these is not there's not a line for virtue and then when you fill that up like a gas tank you go to knowledge that don't happen right and God it's a it's a blowing and a moving all right now who are we at Dentistry 14 yes it's 14. everybody okay I'm gonna try to get to a spot here we've got to get to a spot here for this afternoon now what happens we're not going to read all that but what has happened go to verse 12. now what happened was I love this thing what happened was you know the story Lots going down towards Sodom Abrams in his journey and he hears that some Kings had got together some devils that got together and took his brother off right some devils and come and got his brother and took his brother and all them all right because that's what comes back so what does Abram do Abram doesn't go to another denomination and give a group of people to fight he gets his whole family right remember what does it say come back just roll it back just a little bit because I believe Abram said no verse 14. he armed 318 train servants born in his own house he didn't go out and look for somebody we fight our battles right here justification is really a wonderful thing but you don't want to stay there that's the problem you don't want to just get Justified you want to go on to sanctification because what did Abram do Abram didn't stop Abram and type he kept going on to a higher level all right but when he had heard that his brother was in trouble he took verse 14 when Abram heard that his brother was taken captive he armed his train service born in his own house 318 and pursued them unto Dan and he divided himself against them he and his servants by night and smote them pursued them unto hobos which is on the left side of Damascus and he brought back all the goods all the good and also browned Again by his brother a lot and his goods and the women also and the people now the king of Sodom verse 17 went out to meet him after his return from the slaughter of this king of cheddar or lamb the king of the kings that were with him at the valley of Shiva which is the Kingsdale and Melchizedek now here we see Melchizedek appear in verse 18. all right so now let's go to the second quote goal number two Melchizedek the great Prince it'll take a second then get it up there okay all right notice when he had returned Melchizedek met him who was this Melchizedek and notice the first thing now my candidate did not offer him any money God don't want your money right I didn't offer money Melchizedek only offered in Bread and Wine now candidate was Priest of the most high the king of Jerusalem that was then called Salem here's a crudence concordance that's what he had I thought of it with a question there would be a question afterwards I can prove it that Jerusalem was first Salem j-e-r-u-s-l-e-m-c Salem Jerusalem see it was first called Hiram Jerusalem that's right which once was in Gentile possession oh I hope you get this now Jerusalem was first in Gentile possession and the king of Jerusalem or Salem which was me in the king of Peace king of righteousness made Abraham as a return and give him the communion bread and wine thousands of years or hundreds of years before Brandon wine was ever an ordinance in the church and he was the king of Jerusalem amen all right now let's go to Hebrews seven because this is what happened I'm going to read the rest of this and put up Hebrews 7. got it all right now I'm reading Genesis 14 18. and Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth Bread and Wine and he was the priest of the most high God and he blessed him and said Blessed Be Abram of the most high god possessor of Heaven and Earth this isn't justification and blessed be the most high God which have delivered thine enemy into thy hands and he gave him pies of all now we're going to spend a lot of time on ties but Hebrews 7 says for this Melchizedek king of Salem Priests of the most high God who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the Kings and blessed him to whom also Abram give a tenth part of all first being by interpretation king of righteousness and after that king of Salem which is king of peace and remember he's King of Kings to you and I without father without mother without dissent having neither beginning of days nor ending of life but made life into the Son of God abideth a priest continually now consider how great this man was unto whom even the painter Abraham give the tense I'll be spoil and that's where we get our tithing and it's tithing on your increase gift tithing the tenth of the spoil all right so maybe you tie them the growth some of your tiles on the net you tired on the net you get taxes back you got to pay tithe on it but you pay on the growth you get your taxes back you've already paid tithe on it all right but without paying tight look what Abram done in justification this is my point I'm going to make another point about timing and justification Abram pay tithe justification Abram at times now it's a new birth he didn't come to this great revelation after God filled him with the Holy Ghost no Abram paid tithes to Melchizedek you don't pay tithe at the brother Dale right you don't pay tithes to a church that's right that's right he paid tithes to almighty God Melchizedek it's God right so he paid tithe to Melchizedek you pay your time if you don't pay your pies you're not robbing brother Dale you're not robbing the church you sure they're not robbing me you're Robin none but you're robbing yourself of a blessing I've told you many times before when I when I owned when we had our business there in in Gainesville and I didn't come back to the Lord until 1997 in December and then we grew from 1993 when we bought the business until 1998 we grew a million dollars a year We Grew From three million three and a half million to eight and a half million dollars and I was dummy I wouldn't have the Lord that was just in my mentality in my brain me and my partner my brother Danny we got to a point where we were making our money to a 1998 I turned all that over to God you know the story most of you do I gave it all to God I said God I had dated to come up and pray and and my partner we're the center I didn't care what he did I was gonna pay times on what I made right right so I started doing that and this is a testimony to God because we didn't do nothing actually we got rid of a million and a half dollars worth of business that year the next year and made more money in one year than we did five years in a row we made more money in one year than we did in five years and I paid tithe off of that every bit that we made and God blessed us ever since until I sold it and they're still doing good but see you're robbing yourself of a blessing because he said he would pour out the windows of heaven and Malachi but if Abram paid tithes and justification see if you don't pay tithe then you don't even Justified sorry I didn't say that God did Abram had enough sense to say hey now that's what you do really look I don't want to be I don't want to be mean but that's what Abram said am I said God you've given me all this you've given me this just in a Justified condition I'm still running around the country and I can't find that City remember everyone was looking for a city whose Builder maker was God because God promised him I will give you all these things not only stories here that you can tell of how God's blessed you since you started paying time but my Heavens if Abram was able and Abram was not a born-again Believer even when we type him in the baptism of the Holy Ghost he's just I and we're going to get into this Abram was not a son of God the Bible says it's a friend of God we'll get to that tonight he was not the Son of God not like you and I right right he was not and he paid tithes like I said I don't we don't need your money but God said if you'll pay it he proved that time and time again somebody said brother dick you know somebody said well I can't afford to pay tithes he says I can't afford not to amen I guess we're not to I'm busy blessed in this room by paying time 99 percent if he hadn't blessed you then you're not playing time different paid ties in his journey because one thing he realized he'd come from somewhere that he was down in this earth child beef he would he was miserable his daddy was making a false god and some body spoke to this man and said if you'll start a journey with me I bless you think about that and I saw him sister that's all he done he said if you'll start a journey with me God bless you and Abram come to realize when he met that man face to face he said God I don't want all this I don't want all this and God said just give me you know he's doing 10 more than we do it 90. that's right what what an he wanna eat eat anonymous that's hard to say I'm not gonna say it again Economist I'll say it again but he's great I mean he's good with ten percent what we can do with 90. he runs his whole economy not because of gold not because of money market not because of banks not because of foreclosures and all this stuff he's not worried about the stock market he takes 10 and says hey I'm going to even bless you with this ten percent because that's what he does so that you know he did with the Levi's that's where the Levi's got ten percent and they run their economy with that so just to give it that was just something to throw in there because I had a circle and said entirely on the increase but now watch in Hebrews 7 . let's go back to that again Hebrews 7. let's look at something real quick then we'll start in sanctification for a little while and we'll finish up maybe tonight or this afternoon put Hebrews 7 back up there all right now look one important thing Abram meets God now who does Mel Cassidy become Jesus Christ right he gives communion to Abram all right from now he gives communion to Abram but now when that man Melchizedek becomes Jesus Christ he gives the communion again right and he says I'll not drink no more of this cup until I See You in My Kingdom all right so we come to a place where Jesus said hey sure he's our priest now but that man brother Brown said that man male president became Jesus Christ because the theophany that was talking to Abram because why could Jesus stand there and say before Abraham was I am he was the one that met Joshua he was the one that met Moses Mount Cassidy was not just something that appeared to Abram and nobody else but Abram piping Sons and Daughters of God he had to have a name Melchizedek the word melchized the word Mel malca means king and tezidek means what you see there king of pigs king of frieseness and all those all those things I didn't bring that but that's how you break down that word and that's how the people in the Old Testament see but then Paul picks it up in the New Testament he said this King he said that's Melchizedek the man Melchizedek so the man Melchizedek never leaves what am I trying to say the man male candidate is with you do your whole journey when I start telling you that the new birth is when God comes in you that doesn't mean that God's off somewhere on vacation and you're going through this journey by yourself no God's right there with you because remember he's a high priest what does the high priest do he makes intercession and Buddy and justification you need a lot of intercession I did I did I needed a lot of intercession on what your confession confess your sins confess your thoughts the Bible says one to another amen and the Lord will bless you all right now let's go and he gave him in verse 20 gave him tithes of all so we're done with Hebrews there what what Paul picked it up and told the people in Hebrews he was showing them that that Melchizedek and if you'll read Hebrews 5 6 7 8 9 all up to 10 you'll see how he brings Melchizedek right into Jesus Christ and we'll read that a little bit later on but not now all right now in justification as everybody got him foreign he's on a journey he meets Melchizedek Eva even the king of Sodom in verse 21 let's go back to Genesis 14 21 in the king of Sodom Center to Abram give me the persons and take the goods and Abram said to the king of Sodom I have lifted up my hand unto the Lord the most high God the possessor of having a nurse in other words he's telling that man I met somebody guess what you do when you're in your justification you say look I met a man I met a man the words of a man you ever heard that before the words of a man and he told me he's going to give me come in other words let's read between the lines Melchizedek is it Abram I'll never leave you I'll never forsake you ain't that what Jesus said why couldn't you said it to him he told Abram who was at the toll label my will it's the same theosity same God this was just the garden that had come down in flesh and was speaking straight to Abram eye to eye he met Abram in his Justified condition right he's got to meet you the same way because every son and daughter of the faith has got to go through this same Journey right right know that you're Justified to know you're Justified is to know that you're cleaning yes on the condition of getting clean you understand what I'm saying not not you know sanctification is clean instead aside but at least you know that you have come from a position Abram realized one thing when he when when Melchizedek met Abram Abram knew God was close to him what about a meeting face to face and this King gave Abram Bread and Wine and he said Abram what is communion communing together we don't we take communion because of the of the of the the act in the in the Lord's suffering you know where where you take the wine and you take the bread but what is that communion means communion the Lord said we're going to commune together Abram now he didn't say Abram walk before me and be perfect that's later on in this journey so God only expect you to be perfect in justification the expense used to walk close with him all right now let's go to verse chapter 15. just for a few minutes we'll be we're finished later on after these things look after these things after what things the things we just talked about for an hour oh crap can I say that after these things after what things what we just talked about after the him leaving after him making mistakes after him giving his wife away or trying to and after these things after meeting Melchizedek after paying tithes after these things the word of the Lord came into Abram look at that capital l-o-r-d God himself came into Abram in a vision Abram didn't have a vision until he moved up a little bit higher into sanctification because this is a saint of right chapter 15 right chapter 15. we got a lot of new people here and I I don't want just to be my my thought because we all know these things we've been taught these things and preached them ourselves so chapter 15 is starting the sanctification process of Abram because remember you don't get a name change until you get the Holy Ghost you still in the old yeah but it's being changed after these things the word of the Lord came unto Abram in a vision saying fear not Abram I am thy shield and thy exceeding great reward what about God coming to you and telling you that well he does every Sunday yes right he does every time you read the Bible and Abram said Lord God what will now look if you've got a Scofield bible verse 2 says and Abram said Lord God if you'll read down that is Meister Lord God is Adonai Jehovah he starts calling him father yeah because Jehovah's a father with a family see they don't know the name of Jesus they have to call him by these names in the Old Testament you understand remember Jehovah is not God's name but that's what they called him because that was what was revealed to them at the time all right so Jehovah he said Abram said now he never said Lord God in verse chapter 12 13-14 are you getting this the name is being closer to being revealed as you get closer to your walk with God Lord God Jehovah what will thou give me now look what did Abram do Abram is not being a smart alec Abram is reminding god of what he said when I started my journey God I remember you told me I was going to be a father of many nations and I ain't got a kid I go childless and the story to my house is this Alias are now we're going to pick eliasar up a long way over in the journey all right of Damascus and Abram said behold to me thou has given no seed and loyal one born in my house is my neighbor and behold the word of the Lord came unto him in other words Abram had a question and God quickly gives him an answer and behold the word of the Lord came unto him saying on bowels your own loins shall be thine air had to come from the man Abram ham not Abram remember Abram fathered a child right right but it wasn't the promised child we'll get into that we're gonna have to stop we'll get into it let's read one more one more verse and Abram said behold to me now it's given no seed he reminded God of his promise right now this is really verse 4 and behold the word of the Lord came unto him saying this shall not be thine air but he that shall come forth out of thine own bowels shall be thine air and he brought him forth abroad and said look now toward heaven look up and tell the Stars if thou be able to number them and he said unto them unto him so shall thy seed be now look at verse six we're going to stop right there and he believed in what God Said now wait a minute Abram said I'm childish this conversation is coming to a an end and Abram's still like I got a kid I don't get it but Abram being a father of our faith believe and he believed in the Lord and he counted it what God counted it to him for being right because that's what righteousness means being right right he counted it toward Abraham see listen we can stop ourself in our journey by putting a U.N in front of that and making it unbelief you can stop that Abram didn't because those who is Justified is already glorified that's right he knew Abram was going to make this journey you and I don't but Abram was going through this journey going gone I don't have no children and you told me that my people would be as the sands of the ground but of what God tell him in this part that's right don't look down anymore Abram look up if you can count the Stars if they'll be able to number him he said unto them so shall thy seed be and he believed what the Lord said and he carried to him for righteousness okay same way in your journey folks when you come to start into your journey of sanctification watch how Abram and God comes closer together watch how the communion between will see it this afternoon how the communion between Abram and God becomes closer and closer and closer because we're going to cover in this next chapter we'll cover Abram I'm still the almighty God I brought you from the earth child day I brought you through this journey but now you're gonna have to endure some things I'm going to put you in a vision and I'm going to show you that you are blanked out that you Kim Martinez has nothing to do when we realized that it's God doing the work right amen I told brother Mark I said when we get out of here it's going to have to be something Supernatural because natural will never get us out of here well Gary natural will never get us out of this that'll be Supernatural that's right and it's not something that we got to build ourselves up it's not something that we gotta take any kind of special vitamin it's not something that we got to work out no there's not us doing it right all right yeah exactly right yeah what can one man add to his stature what's the scripture says that's right not a thing that's right you couldn't determine how tall of course now they got growth hormones and all that junk I'm talking about natural right naturally there's nothing we can do to get out of here we're going to have to do one thing depend on God and you watch Abram in this next chapter depend on God and God actually puts him to sleep and said Abram you're dead because see when you can start

up right we're also this afternoon we're going to talk about that new spirit we'll get to that don't worry I read that scripture for a purpose but let's sing a song in our journey and this afternoon do you know there's never been a day like this say you know that one no chance we'll see that this afternoon all right there's never been a day folks I told him in Kansas I said I'm not bragging I'm bragging on God but John Wesley could not stand and preach this sermon Martin Luther could not stand in this day and preach this sermon we gotta believe that buddy I mean folks we gotta believe that there's never been a day like this but every one of those people pointed toward us now that don't make us some great big something right we were lost in need of Salvation Abram never forgot where he came from right because God's going to actually remind him in this next chapter we're going to read I brought you from the earth challenge I'm brought you to this land I brought you to this place and God's got to do that brother gay he's got to tell you I brought you here and if I brought you here I'm gonna take you through right that's my promise I'm gonna take you through let's sing a song real

different different walks in our journey Lord but father we we got to come to a position we've got to come to a place we've got to come to a a place of Abraham and Sarah where we've got to have that
