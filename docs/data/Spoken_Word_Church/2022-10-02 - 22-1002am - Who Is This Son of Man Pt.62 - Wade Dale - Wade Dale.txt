[Applause] we've seen that song you know the world sings that song they ain't got a clue what they're singing about they really don't it's words and it's good they know Elijah was over back there in the Old Testament and they know all this we know what that song's about behold he comes riding on a cloud that's right and now you and I are a greater cloud of witness that he is here he's not coming he's right here with us today hey man good to be back we had a good trip and and uh in Ohio and y'all got some good preaching last Sunday man alive wow that was good post services in the Sunday school and everything was done um brother Aaron picking up with the song service and we sure appreciate it we appreciate everything that everybody does there's no way you can um as I've always said I would uh when we always get together at Christmas you know the greatest Christmas gift we could give brother Dale is that we live what he preaches right if you can drive them and they'll help but one Soul saved we were talking about that last night the Bible study one one man preaching the gospel here look where all brother dick and all the different ones came from Doraville way down there in Atlanta lived all in these different places and then here they start migrating both Tom then brother Tom goes one day and starts working out in a jam and there was Gary Atkin and he presented a message to Brother Gary Atkins and Dean Bradley Gary Atkins come to the message so you see how God is doing he's multiplying himself this is where it was supposed to be had it not been a fall this one that's what I believe we would all come all right the bride would come in its own time in their own time but you know what we've come in our own time now man so there's really nothing different we haven't upset the plan of God the plan of God is exactly the way it's supposed to be amen so thank you for all your prayers and and the uh I was telling brother Bob I'll give you just a minute for Testimony before we get now I got a pretty long list of to uh uh for announcements but there's a sister up there in Ohio and she may be watching in today which is fine her name's Anna and she's in the service and um I noticed Sunday you know I told Bob I said sometimes you know we we think that a powerful preaching of you need to repent you need to come to the Altar and you know a a message of repentance I preached on Daniel 70 weeks but it was on the six-fold purpose which is why Redemption and this girl's just I mean she's just boo-going she took communion for the first time she told Jim she said would you she said I don't know what I'm doing I said when Jim said I'll help you I'll help you through this Isaac he called me yesterday he said she's went and tried to find she's starting to find some dresses for her to wear she's under conviction of the things that she did that's the way a sinner comes that's the way somebody comes to God I couldn't remember her name I just called her sister Alabama that's all I remember but her name's Anna now but just pray for her amen just pray for her she's she's uh the only the family that she's got a good family and she's a boyfriend of of Isaac's son brother Gabriel she's a girlfriend of his and um that she's just a sweetheart she's just really a nice person I mean and we're going to pray that God will help her through all this amen and being in the military you know you may have to do certain things like you may have to wear you know slacks or something during your army time but we're going to pray that God will make talk and he'll just put all that together listen if there's a desire in your heart God will give you a person in the pulpit he will give you a desire to come to church he'll give you a desire to be saved because we can't save anybody amen we can just preach the word but just preaching the word of God bring somebody under conviction I'd really appreciate that so now let me get the announcements uh brother Zach called

thing brother brother sister Angie Brown called with a prayer request for a brother Freddie he's in ICU so let's remember brother Freddy listen I see you boy we had a good Bible Study last night good Bible Study last night had a good time in the Lord had a lot of people had 11 people on zoom and had a bunch of people sitting there and I appreciate all of you coming I appreciate some of you that fixed things and and brought things but we're gonna we're gonna also starting next year We're not gonna have Bible study in November the 5th because that'll be the night before the wedding and we need to let that be where we can get everything ready for the wedding so we won't have it November may have it in December well you know how rough December is also but starting January we're going to have in January we're going to have youth service the third Saturday of January as far as I know now brother Daryl Ward is going to be with us on that service all right then the F then we won't have Bible study we usually don't in January anyway because it falls on the first of the year but we're going to have Bible study on on the other odd months like February at the third Saturday not the first so we're going to change this around and we'll be letting you know a little bit later on but we decided that last night so now take your calendar my whole point is take your calendar and put a circle around the third Saturday of every month one month it's going to be used the next month it'll be Bible study so just write that down in your put it in your calendar I still use one of those I have one in my phone I have my little notes but I do have a calendar brother John and I walk by and I see that X and I'm like what or that star it reminds me to go to the doctor or it reminds me to have Bible study so just remember that and keep that in your prayer also um yes I got every bit of that also I want to I want to I some of you know that that uh when that I had created a list of people that uh and I called their names over the pulpit and it by no means was I want to hurt anybody's feelings or call anybody out by no means because God knows my heart but it did upset some people and it did cause a little stir I don't want that God knows I don't want that I want people saved and I believe the Lord had me write that list but I in my misinterpretation should have kept hitting my Bible and prayed for him by myself that's where I missed it and I apologize that I missed that part of the discernment that I was I was zealous and I'm sorry I'd rather be zealous than asleep but in being zealous I do not want to hurt people's feelings and I apologize and if you see anybody that you know that that was here that day or that I call their name I apologize from the bottom of my heart no way in the world would I want anybody to not come to church all right everybody with me on that all right and I I I looked up today and brother Branham did the same thing one time he did the same identical thing he said but he said I don't want to do that anymore he said it hurt too many people's feelings well some people I know I know that but listen I apologize for what I did I want you to forgive me forgive me for what I did all right that was not appropriate at the time in the moment it's not inappropriate to pray for people but it would be inappropriate I guess to call somebody out I I was looking at a quote back here for brother Brown called the girl out one time and she missed her she missed her whole eternal life by being angry at brother Brown so don't be angry at me love me and forgive me of what I did because I do feel now that looking back on it that that uh that it was inappropriate to do at the time and I do apologize for that say Man everybody all right with that let's move forward let's keep going we're going to we got battles we're on a battleship not a cruise ship right we got battles to fight we got to learn how to fight all right that's what we're doing here with a statue of perfect man so let's turn our Bibles to um to John 1 1 this would be part 62. I want to bring out a few things extra that we did on Wednesday night and then this afternoon I stumbled on something that we really really need to look at uh according to the Statue of perfect man listen as we were talking about last night brother Dale brought to brought the porn out last night I mean you enjoyed brother Dale last night bringing it out all right so thank God for that I appreciate that and and and you know we cherish that and he was saying about justification sanctification he said there's some that will come to justification it won't come to sanctification the summit come to the baptism Holy Ghost some won't come to the baptism and Holy Ghost so I'm gonna come to the Statue of perfect man some won't but it's not for us to pick who they are it's for us to preach the gospel throw the net out there and whatever you get you're going to drag some fish in and because we need to go to the Lost we need the lost in because I'm telling you the door is fixing to be shut at least I know one thing's for sure thus that the Lord we're one day closer to the Rapture than we were yesterday right we're we're one month closer September 2022 is gone we're one month closer to the coming of the Lord now I want to be ready don't you I don't want to leave nobody behind I want to be ready all right so let's buy our heads Lord thank you for all the time that you give us with our brothers and sisters and I pray now that you'd sanctify us Lord for this journey forgive us of our sins and our many mistakes that we make Lord you know in our heart that we want everybody to make it we don't want anybody to miss out we want we want this church full of people that with the Holy Ghost that that you can work through them and speak through them even in speaking in tongues and even even worshiping and even being song leaders and being deacons and being elders and being ministers we want Lord each one to be a part of the body of Christ and father we pray Lord that you just give us this day our daily bread forgive us of our sins bless the ones that are sick bless this here that sister Andy Brown called in about the brother Freddy that you would he and I see you we don't know what's wrong with him doesn't matter doesn't matter about distance we know one thing's for sure you can go there in a split second and touch our brother Lord just touch us and lead us and guide us by your Holy Spirit in Jesus name we pray Amen in the beginning was the word words with God and Word was God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory of the only begotten of the father fall of Grace and Truth first Thessalonians says that every one of you should know that's what we're doing we're learning we're learning to know how to possess his vessel in sanctification and honor Romans 12 verse 2 says and be not conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God and what is the will of God his word you may be seated in the Lord has blessing to the reading of the word and we look and we see that we were talking about last night only in the son of man Ministry Judas was sitting right there beside Jesus they said Jesus who is the one's going to betray me or betray you he said the one that stops in the bowl well there was Judas with his bread siping in the bowl and they're still going is it me is it me is it me you see how deceived they were amen see how deceived they were but now who was not deceived the son of man was not deceived he knew who that was by spiritual discernment he knew that Judas was going to do what he was going to do all right so now I understand and know that if we talk about anointed ones at the end time and this thing's going to be so close until it's a Razor's Edge in between it only that there's going to be as we're talking about a few minutes there's going to be a showdown there's going to be a showdown there is going to be a time it separates because Judas looked at Jesus and what Jesus what did Jesus say he said go do what you need to do and he went out that was judas's problem he left he left the presence of God what was Cain's problem back in the Garden of Eden well he didn't have a problem while he was in the garden because God said hey if you'll do like your brother said I'll say in other words I'll save you that was a question last night and you know you hear people in the message preaching lineages and how that this is a serpent seed line and you can't do it come on people good grief Satan even had a choice amen he was made perfect he was made the anointed cherub he was made the right hand man of God until iniquity was found in his heart he made a choice Cain made a choice to go in another Direction it's all by choice folks it's my brother whis did a wonderful job Sunday bringing it down but you know what there's a lot of people that don't that don't like that because they want to think that they were just this always was an eagle and I'm always sitting in church and I'm always this and it makes that Brother Sam said it makes them lazy it makes you where you just say okay I got it boy I just felt something right here well you know what Judas when he was preaching the gospel remember Jesus gave him power to preach the gospel cast out devils that's why I said that somebody was talking about Judas last night the Bible says that Satan entered into the heart of Judas we read it we're going to read it in communion right Simon's son to betray him it entered him and you know brother Brian will say well he was the son of perdition he wasn't the Son of Perdition he was the son of Judas as whoever his mom and daddy was but when he accepted Satan's life when he accepted Satan why because here's my point the Bible Jesus looked at the people and says look bless you do that in about 40 minutes somebody wake up but here's Jesus and he looks at the people and he says you call me belzebub he said but Satan can't cast out Satan so if Judas was Satan he couldn't be casting out Devils when God told him but no he could cast out Devils because God give him an opportunity he give him three and a half years to make it right and finally he had to come to a showdown in the upper room he said Judas go do what you need to do Satan entered his heart and he went and did what he did and then remember the prophet of God said if he'd have made it to Pentecost he could have been saved he just he stopped that's our problem we shouldn't stop we need to keep going to what the Holy Ghost he was justified he was Sanctified but he was not filled with the Holy Ghost all right he would just but you said well that was just a lot no it wasn't as lineage right it was the foreknowledge of God knowing what Judas would do when he got here that's so simple it goes over people's mind and they go like well that was it I'm stamped you know I'm I'm gonna make it I'm predestinated listen everybody is predestinated every person is even Satan is predestinated don't you think God made him knowing what he would do but he made him to make a choice and when he made that choice he could be a Healer a savior a redeemer and all these different attributes that God could display because Satan made a choice listen God made a choice he chose me and you to be his bride so he made a choice he didn't have to listen he doesn't need us to exist but he wants us here to exist with him to come down into what into life into time get born again makes your soul Eternal not the rest of you and then you go what you go back to where you came from very simple in continuance we're being born as I was telling them last night and to preacher the other day was talking and he said you know what he said I know you're lost and I know you're a center for one thing you got a belly button you were tied to a woman you know what brother Brown said the problem was we were born by a woman if we're born by a man we'll live so that Genesis 1 26 man that I love so much that theophany of God it'll have a belly button because it was not tied to a woman it's tied to God it's tied to the eternal and that's what comes to you to New Birth listen if that was already in you Jesus didn't have to die what did the Holy Ghost come for kind of simple but you know what one word off folks you say boy sometimes y'all are a little bit uh dogmatic that's all right with me they call Jesus everything in the world but God maybe we ought to try that sometime be not conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind that's what we got to work on because listen in your soul you have the mind of Christ today in your soul you are born again in your soul your Eternal Paul says sitting in Heavenly places in Christ try that on Monday yeah get up on Monday about two hours into your day and say I'm living in Heavenly places yeah exactly so all of us know we're all smiling we know what it on Monday you know two or three o'clock in the afternoon or right once you get up you got all that Monday stuff to do all right but that's your outside guy the inside guy is sitting in Heavenly places it is redeemed it is already up that statue of perfect man in itself but you and me we have to work on the memory reason conscious and affection or we wouldn't need a renewing of our mind renewing of this thing right as a man thinketh in his heart so is he we know the new birth changes that we were talking last night it absolutely transforms you into the children of light as the Bible says and not the children of Darkness that's why I said many times we we just look at quotes where brother Brown does say that you you know you were born with this seed now you were born in representation we know that but I want to ask you a question if you have a question about what we believe here in this church let me give you one example and it should help all of you go to the Book of Luke I've been reading it for the past three months the Bible says the unclean Spirit goes out of a man goes out of your what your soul so God can't be in your soul and Satan be in your soul at the same time folks it's a two Soul doctrine that was preached daddy fought against it for years back in the 80s did God give you a soul sake give you a soul whichever one beat it out and filed it and whichever one the devil ain't the devil I know is not that strong but the God I know is amen I was lost that unclean Spirit was in my soul it made me do things I didn't want to do sometimes but yes there was representation God knew before the foundation of the world that one day I get sick and tired of being sick and tired and I come right here to this altar on December the 17th 1997 and gave my heart to the Lord I knew there was a change but I knew it wasn't finished I wasn't finished oh that's it that seed just come to life and I started just preaching and and no I sat for six months before I got the baptism of the Holy Ghost I come to church read my Bible start opening service Philadelphia was once you take Sunday school so I started teaching Sunday school and it was a long time after that a year or so after the year after that and I think brother dick still got the or not him but you still got the tape there's a VHS tape that brother dick made in this church on my first sermon I preached so uh and from then on guess what I made a million mistakes backslid yes we all do but we still got to keep going get up and go again get up and go again Muhammad Ali he got knocked down a couple of times but you know what he made it it was the Gang why but he had to suffer we're going to read a scripture here we've got to suffer the rain we just don't become reigning Kings by nothing no we have to come to a place and that's why we believe in the Statue of perfect man we believe in justification which what chops off your past sins sanctification where that unclean Spirit that's in your soul that you were born with us a damnic nature you were born with a nature with a belly button comes from your parents and then you got to be born again by the word of God so your representation what comes down and gives you the New Birth by foreknowledge God knew all things second Peter 1 says Simon Peter and servant and Apostle of Jesus Christ to them and what have obtained now why would we have to obtain stuff why would we have to fight why does the bible give us all these things that we got to do to get salvation if we already got it let's just say we were lost I like that I was lost I knew that I didn't just come to realization listen I'd heard sermons I had read books I'd listen to tapes but I wasn't born again I was lost that was an unclean spirit inside of me if you were and you know what if you'll realize that you might figure out you lost and need salvation what brother they'll always said we love to quote brother Dale I love this is the best quote I had rather seek every day of my life like Brother Don he's talking about putting on that list absolutely I'd rather seek God every day of my life and know that I had it at the end than to say well I always was eternal I think I'll just I'll just sing a couple of songs yeah I'll read a couple of books and and I'll make sure I don't put a dress on I mean I'll put a dress on until somebody sees me or don't see me right no it's a life it's a life-changing this is a life-changing message it's not a life listen it's not a it's not a it's not a a feel-good every once in a while attitude no it's a life I'd rather fight every day and say Lord how many of us have raised our hands and said God save me right man where'd that come you know God's not going to go oh no you won't have to say that I already know you should know by now no you got another little bird sitting on this shoulder going you ain't nothing you didn't do this you didn't do that you thought about this you spoke bad about this one he's gonna be right here and usually his volumes turned up a lot louder than this one over here I don't know if y'all I live this I don't know I'm just telling you my experience if you don't live it then that's fine pray for me but we do we all live it we all live here in humanity but we got up the statue of perfect man though it's what's going to work on our memory reason conscious affection imagination that all by the renewing of our mind as this afternoon we'll look at virtue virtue when you say virtue first thing that pops up or did would pop up in your head a virgin life clean life that's okay but that's not what that virtue means that virtue means power it means power and brother Brown said power without character satanic so we got to have the virtues the virtue the verse used to become a powerful Army and man's everybody with me because listen Peter James John Paul they all had these virtues working in their life so it's not something brand new it's something we need to read in the book of Acts you read in the book of Acts you're going to see the characteristics of Jesus Christ because that's who he was in his people they had got the unclean Spirit driven out of them come on somebody in the upper room and they what was filled with the Holy Ghost then they grew and Grace and knowledge Simon Peter servant Apostle of Jesus Christ with them have retained like Precious Faith with us through the righteousness of God and our Savior Jesus Christ Grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God and Jesus our lord according has his divine power divine power hath given unto us all things that pertaining to life and godliness the knowledge of him that hath called us what to glory and virtue whereby are given unto us exceeding brother Brian said I read it the other day brother says don't ask for little things ask for big things he's a big guy ask for big things well I'm afraid he's going to be a little bit busy you ain't serving the same God I am en lying's never busy the old song says he's always right there right and he's never ladies always on time we may think he is but we're going to talk about patience in a little bit we're about her giving unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these you might be what partaker so then we're able to partake of something we're going to partake partake of more of God yes all right if you got God in your soul you don't need to back up and start cleaning the soul back out it's clean we just need to let it out let that soul out and let it start doing its work and that's what we're talking about and how's it going to do it by the word of God yes yes no other way except by the word of God all right having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust so the first stage is the birth brother Ryan says the first thing you got to do is be born again all right not realize you always was you can now you got to remember there's a there's a there's there's a two-fold we look at the Bible and we see that we were talking last night there's some scriptures that we use for the Millennium some will use for the future home some we can interchange there's some that we can't right so scripture has a dual meaning so brother Bradley said well brother Brown's got to do a minute yeah there's a doom any you got to be born again you've got to be born from above you got to be born again brother Brown didn't bring us a way to be born again it's already in the Bible he just brought us back to it what do you say restore yeah the faith of the father how are you going to restore something that's got 12 000 different denominations how are you going to restore that you can't there's only one truth amen one truth One Faith one Lord one baptism and his brother Richard Negron said he said there's one truth God you got to take me into that one truth not several truths one truth but the first thing you got to do is be born again you've got to be changed and when you're changed you become a new creation oh one time brother Brown said not the old one patched up the old one patched up is just the old you you've stuck peacock feathers into your Blackbird flesh and man that's what brother Bradham said but when you're born again it'll take care of itself when you're bored again like I've always said take a hog scrub it up put a suit on it and turn him out where's he go he's gonna go right back to the mud as we were talking last night you take people don't like the quotes of brother Brown where he says you were a kookaburra you work huckleberry and by the transforming power of God to make you a wheat he had to take the wheat life which is him you have to take the wheat life the wheat germ and put it in the cuckleberry it may still look like a kookaburra right but inside it's not a kookaburra anymore because it has had life not just that you all no you know what you know what came to life if you're a kookaburra kookaburra right but if you take the wheat life and put it in the Kookaburra you'll act like the wheat life just like this right here if you take what you take the life of a pig take it out and put the life of a lamb in he'll look like a pig sometimes he'll act like a pig come on somebody but deep down inside he's had a change and he won't go to that mud hole anymore he'll start acting better he'll start acting right all right you must be born again that is change there's got to be a change let's go down here a little bit further he might make a good neighbor but he isn't a Christian until he's born again that takes care of the always was right listen as we were as I brought my thought back thank you Lord but you know brother Brown when he's talking you got to remember he's in the mind of God sometimes and he's on Earth sometimes everybody with me he's in the mind of God he actually said let's go back into the bad part of God's mind so he took us back there to show us that we always were Eternal if we have the new birth if we've accepted it down here all right and if you hadn't then guess what that's what brother Brown said he said he said what'd he say about the the Pharisees he said they did not have represents what was a representation that God by far knowledge looked down and said they're not going to accept me therefore I don't have to keep anything for them but I'm not going to let them know that they said brother random if this is all true this predestination why are you preaching because why would you preach he said I'll throw the net out now throw the net out I bring it in he said I get crawdads he said I get snakes I get different things he said but I get some fish every once in a while because you know what we are not born the word of God that brother Louise was talking about you got to read that and who is this Melchizedek brother Brown said we didn't come word for him we came with a belly button we came with an older Dynamic nature Jesus now listen he came with a belly button but he wasn't attached to his mama that wasn't his mama's blood that was God's blood everybody with me he was attached by normal but remember he had to come like me and you he couldn't come different to save us and to give us New Birth why would he need to come if he just on Nicodemus come on now you're the you're the teacher of Israel you know every quote there is in the book all you got to do is just believe that no he said you've got to be born again you've got to be changed from what you were to a new creature in Christ that's why there's not many new births it's just a good feeling I just want us all to be born again that's why I want us to all strive Lord save me but now we can't stay there though Hebrews 6 1 says leaving therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ not leaving it and throwing it away no go up higher let us go on into Perfection sure he loves us to be babies but he wants us to be adults he won't he don't want us to uh brother Brown preach why cry why can't I speak when you can't speak if you speak a mess you got to speak with the virtues working in your life as I'll read in just a little while or maybe this afternoon he said those those uh disciples they waited on God and when they got a little nod they knew what to do with it that's what you and I have to do therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ let us go on into Perfection not laying again the foundation of repentance and that's okay we'll baptized we baptize 20 people we'll baptize whoever needs to be baptized we'll get you started in the right direction but you are going to have to make an effort right right to get born again of the doctrine of baptism and laying on of hands and resurrection of the dead and of Eternal judgment and look and this we will do if God permits how's he going to do it how are we going to do it he gave some Apostles some prophets some evangelists some pastors and teachers what for the Perfection of the Saints I've said many times before and I'll say it again you can get born again we were talking about last night I keep referring back last night if all y'all would have been here last night we wouldn't have to refer back to last night but anyway um last night we were talking about that and for the perfecting of the Saints there was a chicken yard there was a chicken yard and brother Brown's always refers to that about his little Eagle story all right see that then everybody goes oh there it is brother I always was an eagle you got to remember what what was the barnyard what was the chickens denominations he was preaching to people that were stuck in denomination that was already born again but they just didn't realize that he was the mother eagle come on people brother Brown's message not brother Brown his message was the mother Eagle that that went over into their Church and preached the word and said come out of her Eagles you got to realize who you are right because remember you were born a kookaburra and you had to be transferred life transferred into you for the Perfection of the Saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of Christ till look till we all come to the unity of faith of the knowledge of the Son of God and to a perfect man into the measure of the Statue of the fullness of Christ look that we hint forth being no more children toss to and fro and carried away with every wind of Doctrine by what the slight of men sadly the same preachers amen carried about with every wind of Doctrine by the slight of men and cunning craftiness whereby they lie and wait to deceive listen God has never ever ever spoke a false Doctrine ever he can't he is the truth that's why Jesus is the truth that's why this message is the truth but they took this message and divided it up into 700 different places or different ideas but there's got to be one from whom the whole whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that whichever joint supplies we better get compacted because every crack we have the devil is going to stick something in it because that's his job that man does his job really well but I got a God that does it way better than that he's wanting to heal me he's wanting to save me not destroy me according to the factual working in the measure of every part making the increase of the body into the edifying itself in love i hidden life in Christ what a beautiful picture it is today of a consecrated life who once enters in with Christ dead to the things of the world hid away with God and the veil dropped around him and all the world shut off then Christianity and religion become a pleasure azure to every believer if you're struggling sure we have struggles but if you're struggling with that you need to get born again I'm sorry I it's just there's two factions working here there's two powers devil power and God's power there's not an in-between right then Christianity and religion becomes a pleasure to every believer I love coming to bible study I love coming to church I love studying to come and preach to you while you're out doing whatever you're doing brother Dale did it for years and years and years I'm beginning to understand a little bit why he went crazy I'm not talking about that I'm talking about he wouldn't it just went crazy he would come to the house and sit down he said put on a hunting video and I knew right then that there was a issue going on that he was having a problem with Humanity with y'all's humanity and mine because I was lost he was still praying for me too he said put on a hunting video he just sit there put on a hunting video and I put one on he'd watch it and he said okay let's go hunt her he doesn't talk about something like that because I couldn't talk he couldn't talk to me about the word of God but he had to get that out of his mind he had to get that out of his mind look at brother Brown he looked 70 something years old he just looked old he was only 56 a lot of us have already passed that he was 56 but the body look at Jesus you be a man not over 50 years old it was only 33. it was the work they did you know what it was we were going to get into it the reason I said that we're going to get into it that because you've drug virtue out of that man for all those years sister gayles the ones that been here a lot we've drug virtue out of brother Dale the good part of virtue we drug it out of him and that's what we do we we virtuous power you got to have it before you can draw from it we'll read that from Brother Bradham talks about you got to have it so you got to have somebody that has it before you can draw it from them then when you draw it from them you just get weak in the knees you get brother Brown says I can't even feel my face sometimes my face goes numb the man well we were praying for those people the other weekend and and brother Ronnie and I were discussing a little bit later I cannot remember who we were praying for but all of a sudden you just kind of feel like that that somebody's pulled a plug on your electrical circuit and you just go now I know some of the ministers know that no dad knows it for sure because he's done it before laying hands on the sick there's a charge comes out of you and when that person receives something they're pulling it from you they're pulling it out of you they're pulling that strength out of you and you know that people get and I don't go by those feelings but there is sometimes when you go man that person really got something because it just it just drains you and it just sometimes will knock you backwards almost but you know what that's the way it ought to work that's the virtue and each one of you should have virtue that we can draw from that we can go to you not like I said before if we got a problem in our Christian life you don't go to the convenience store and ask the convenience owner what to do about something in your life you know what he's going to tell you have a drink right have a smoke now is that virtue or not no there's no virtue in that but you come and talk to a preacher you talk to a friend of yours that you know is born again and you get what you get strength from that you get virtue from that that's what we're going to talk about knowing that you ought not to do this I was talking you know what reason I think about you look at brother Homer Longoria look at these ministers that are getting older and man they're just I mean I'm not saying they're falling apart don't get me wrong but they're body wise we're not made for that kind of an anointing to just be every day just bombarding your flesh you get old looking brother Homer he's having some bad issues uh he's getting better now but uh he that COPD that he's had and to be a minister that's the first thing Satan should attack it's his lungs because he can't speak he gets all clogged up and he can't speed well you know what if he shuts us all up he wins he is not going to shut us all up somebody's gonna make it somebody is going to take this thing forward and we go listen what I always say lead follow or get out of the way don't hinder well well I got awful now because that's for this afternoon but anyway but that's what virtue is virtue's not living a virgin life it's drawing strength from from from sermons and strength from even from Brother Adam if you got the Holy Ghost and you listened to a tape that was that was in the 40s he said well that's pretty weak no you draw strength from that why there's virtue in that you draw virtue from all that amen even brother random I was reading just a few minutes ago talking about altar calls he made altar calls up to up to his he died but he said it's not supposed to be right not supposed to there's not no supposed to be an altar call in a gentile Church that's what he said he said it speak the word and that's supposed to be it he said but we still have them and we'll continue to have them amen we're supposed to come into speaking dick condition but we still lay hands on the sick because that's what the Bible says can't take it out of the Bible amen so what you draw virtue from that you come up here what you've gone up here saying well I don't know if I want that guy to pray for me or not well if you don't then find somebody to pray for you somebody you got some confidence here somebody's got some virtue because you know what it's something you need amen it's something you need so here we are going up the statue of perfect man we got to start down here at the bottom at the new birth which is faith have faith and be born again we got to have faith for the new birth and then we climb up as that Shadow shows us you start as a little kid and then you come up what to full maturity this is the only age that we're to come to full maturity hey man that's right everybody else didn't didn't have the open book they they didn't know what the seals were they didn't know what these different doctrines that we know about now because remember the sales is for your Redemption full Redemption Body Spirit and soul working under a closed book they didn't come to the body change they couldn't because they didn't have the seals open even Paul Peter the ones we're talking about here there's a further month past that oh there is God wants a body change that they couldn't come to but you and I can I guess why those seals are so important that's why the Daniel 70 weeks that's why all these different doctrines have to be lined up or you will not get it like Dad said last night it doesn't de-christianize people because I understand when he makes those statements a lot of people say well he's saying I ain't a Christian no it's not saying that because your baby right here if you're born again today as we were talking last night how many times have I said that we get to live in the new city because we're born again here we receive the new birth here we are bride here now there's going to be if it if it's brother Brown talks about one in a million if there's one of us there's a million people going to live outside the city if there's a million of us there's going to be 100 million people or more than that a billion people live out in outside somebody with me so the new birth puts us in that position that we can go to that City not go through judgment but the foolish version has got to go through judgment because they came to justification and sanctification they didn't go on to the New Birth so they have to brother Brown said give their life for the gospel but they gonna stay dead for a thousand years and then come up at the wife's own judgment and have to give what an account of what they did I do not want to give an account of my works do you our righteousness is filthy rags the Bible says but who stood for you the one that is righteous Jesus Christ stood my sin he stood my judgment he went to judgment hall for me and you that's why that's so important to get born again because you get born again you get to live in the city now listen the ones on the outsider is just as Eternal As You Are because there's only one form of eternal life there's not degrees but there is position folks come on there's possession clowns you're going to be what priests and kings there is position that goes with here now what goes with a position here brothers and sisters it's why it's so important without somebody living these virtues and being sealed by a special anointing we'll talk about way later and that Capstone which is him sitting down on the church and taking a body change we're going to still be here and just die all over the place somebody's got to come through this and manifest the son of man that's the plan I didn't make it but I sure want to be a part of it don't you you want to be a part of it say I want to be a part of it that makes it an individual I want to be a part of it then I want my kids to be a part of it I want my family to be a part of we want my in-laws to be a part of it why wouldn't you he certainly If any man will come after me let him deny himself take up his cross daily so you got to cross the bear as I said before there are some people that are enemies of the cross that will never be given eternal life you'll never see them in a kingdom anywhere except the one down underneath all right but there is going to be a group of people giving eternal life cup of water in my name foolish virgin the ones that didn't hear the gospel brother Brown said will be judged by what their works then they'll be divided as sheep to goats they'll get to live outside the city right billions of people living outside the city but there's only going to be a bride living in the city with 144 000 as servants to the bride and like I said yesterday that's the difference in the Millennium in the future home in the Millennium the Bible says we'll build and inhabit in the Millennium that thing's already built it was built before the foundation of the world it was that Genesis 1 26 man that was the kingdom that was built that's going to set down on the mountain after everything else is wiped off again even all this stuff that we did in the Millennium is going to be wiped off for a new Heaven and a new Earth just the way he wiped you off but look you're still here the hand that used to pick up a beer now picks up a Bible the voice in my voice in my mouth it used to curse doesn't do that anymore so he didn't destroy the frame he's not going to destroy the framework of this of this world see that's a great Revelation because most people think well this is just going to be annihilated and we're going to go to heaven live on a cloud play a heart I don't know that's not true this is our Earth Satan took it from me and you he didn't take it from God he took it from us Adam what's the ruler of this Earth Adam the prophet said had the title deed to this earth hey when you hold a towel indeed what's that ownership he owned it but forfeited it for Eve because he loved her and he said I don't can't you can't destroy her without destroying me what did Moses say when he fell in the Gap he said look God if you're going to destroy them people you got to destroy me too he stood in the Gap he stood as what Christ and the bride doing the bad stuff that they were doing but Jesus said I'll take their sin I'll take it on me because I'm going to have a bride so there's some that are what enemies of the Cross some go to the cross and get born again or get Justified or get Sanctified but there's a group of people that takes every bit of that and takes up your cross you take up your individual cross and you follow him for whosoever shall save his life shall lose it but whosoever will lose his life for my sake the same shall save it I protest in by my by your rejoicing which I have in Christ look I Die daily I Die daily things I used to do I do them no more things I used to do I do them no more why you changed you've got a new attitude you've got God is starting on the renewing of your mind he's starting to let you see things that he didn't let people see before start let you enter into what the mind of God to see now as we see as mature Christians that's why brother around him he said it's hard to preach predestination to a group that's not in other words not grown up right remember he said it's not a good word to use out there but the Ephesian Church you could use that word and know that those he foreknew he did predestinate for knowledge is always first because it's four knowledge it was before predestination he foreknew therefore he could predetermine your destination by what you choose I was thinking about this the other day brother Dale years ago preached on the the uh God being infinite and us being finite God being infinite knew that if I never met June and I married the girl that I dated before which was I'm not gonna call her name but you don't know who it was how my life would have ended up that's an infant got infinite God knowing all things how did if you chose this path that's why you say well prove it to me brother Brown said God's no's are the best yeses you'll ever get because you're going to go down there how many of us have said this is it this is the will of the Lord this is everything I've been looking for I I mean Donnie don't don't I'm not pointing at you I'm pointing over under me I'm sorry I didn't I called your name listen but we've all been through it we've all said this is it this is the Promised Land and come to find out it was the Wasteland amen but if we were to listen to God a child of God listens to God it's like we were talking about the other day you know the guy said well God why didn't you save me uh when he got to Heaven he said Lord why didn't you save me he said I sent you two boats I sent you an airplane a helicopter and you said no I'm waiting on no if God sends you a helicopter you better get on it so if God says no so there I proved my point if God says no he knows that if you're going to go down this path right here what your end is going to be and he's going to say no child don't go that way so that's why it's the best yes as you'll ever get because then you turn around and say hey there's something there's something going to happen God already sees something that's going to happen down at the end of the road here I better not go down that way thank God for that amen remember he's only obligated to his children everybody with me he's obligated to his kids so he's obligated to take care of us aren't we obligated to take care of our kids until they get old enough to fend for their self not be Boomerang Kids throw them out they come back throw them out they come back I got one so that's okay what some of us yeah well Donnie's got a couple too so praise God you know I'd rather be him there than be in the bars I'd rather be there into being a drug house please God pray for him so you know what give something pray for if you ain't got nothing else to pray for pray for your kids because you know what they'll make you pray for them because you love them they're part of you you can't just you can't just kick them out in the world I'm sorry let me get into this you're a chosen generation here we go a royal priesthood a holy nation in other words God's saying I'm going to take care of you I'm going to give you a kingdom give you this Earth you can have it but we got to go through these what light afflictions the Earth has got to go through a couple of times of being renovated remember it was renovated in the flood right it's going to be renovated in the battle of Armageddon for the Millennium then it's going to be really renovated when God steps up and wipes everything off except us we can be standing right in the middle of it and be going man this is pretty nice in the world just being wiped completely off because we're what we're in glorified bodies these are we've got the new birth and we've come to a body change and we're no more less God than he is except for position we're the bride right but he said we're bone of his bone and flesh of his flesh that's what he said but we got to come to it it's not just something that just falls on us all right don't you really wish well I do when I was in about the second or third grade I just wish that I knew calculus and algebra and I could just jump up and going into college no I it took me 12 long years Brother John yeah being an accountant you I mean when you're third grade you say man I can do your undo your taxes for you no you can't that would be a disaster please don't ever do that but that's the way God that's the way we grow in God he was an intelligent child I was an intelligent child lost it a lot afterwards but I had to still go through what the required courses I had to go through the required courses right we're going to see here in just a few minutes where God said that these are required these virtues are required of you they're not a they're not an elective you remember you know what electives are what do they call them now maybe what they call them now it's not an elective but it's what it's called it's oh it's still called an elective I thought it was called something else alternate learning or whatever it is you know you it's an elective that you really don't need that to graduate but it'd be nice I took what I took was is and y'all know my story I love math and I wasn't uh never made a beat till I got to college and and I I could understand calculus algebra that was nothing to me I took a general mathematics course my senior year as an elective didn't need that no more than nothing but you know what I learned how to do fractions and and me and T was the same way I mean you we do our stuff in our head because he had you know he he had a uh a business where he had to no figures and no different when I so did I and that helped me more than anything oh coach Whitaker good grief he chewed tobacco and spit in the in the cannon and done other things in the classroom but he taught me how to do fractions taught me how to read a tape measure how many y'all know how to read a tape measure that's what I thought not many because you know what that wasn't a required course though now required was algebra required was calculus required were the well this you know what those are required courses that's required courses we got to go through the seventh grade one two three four five six seven look that you should show forth the Praises of him that has called you out of Darkness into His Marvelous Light which in times past you were not a people oh I always was well this said you weren't which in times past were not a people but are now the people of God which had not obtained Mercy but now have obtained Mercy now praise God nearly beloved I beseech you strangers and pilgrims sustained from fleshly lust which war against your soul having your conversation honest among the Gentiles that whereas they speak against you as evildoers they may by your good works which they Shall Behold glorify God in the day of visitation you're going to help somebody by the way you live or you're going to hurt somebody by the way you live that's what we're fixing to get into hey man you gonna hurt somebody or help somebody submit yourself to every ordinance of man for the Lord's sake whether it be Kings or Supreme in other words if you've got to go to work tomorrow be there at eight o'clock don't come in at 8 15 and say well the Lord told me I didn't have to be here till 8 15. you're probably asking the Lord to get you another job amen I mean you know you pray for God to give you a job and you sit at home watch television I don't know if God's gonna give you one or not he's going to ask for a little effort that's just a laugh lesson there aren't the governors as unto them that are sent by him for the punishment of evil doers for the praise of them that do well this is why I'm getting to him for so is the will of God all right so is the will of God that with well-doing you may put to silence the ignorance of foolish man that's what we're doing here put to silence the ignorance of foolish men how are we going to do that now we got to come to full Doctrine I like good shouting meetings where we just clap our hands and shout and have a good time have a great powerful service and things dance in the bubble as it were but wait then when The Showdown time comes you don't know where you're standing so there's going to be a showdown there's going to be a showdown in your life there's going to be a showdown in church there's going to be a showdown with the devil because he's got dibs on your body there's going to be a showdown where one day you're going to say Satan this is not yours no more amen we should be starting to say that now but there's going to be a showdown of culmination in other words of everything that was a showdown when Noah preached 120 years one day God said enough that's enough get in the ark I'm gonna close the door there's a showdown time in other words what's he saying when you when we come and we have the great service like we did a couple weeks ago but we can't live what we preach we all fall short but we keep getting up and going there's a showdown you don't know where you're standing let's get back and find out let's find out what's making us do that listen let's find out what's making us act wrong let's find out what's making us think wrong yeah that's what the statue to me that's what statue perfect man is it's not just living a knows how to act to your boss it's how to act to your neighbors it's how to act to these different to different people now look now what is it we'll stop right here it's easy to feel the power of God to see it when you believe but then when it comes to The Showdown are you able to possess the thing that you profess to have that's the thing brother you've got to get it we've got to take it it's ours but you'll fight for every inch Fellowship 1962. brother Brown says we're all tried every Christian every son every child that comes to God is tried what not by the neighbor oh yeah well it is but it's Tried by the word of God Amen you're Tried by the word yes you know brother Brown said he'll have a brother say something to you off kind of off to see how you'll react to it I have to swallow that one have somebody say something to you to see how you'll Act you know what your child training my child training see if you'll be loyal to it when The Showdown comes what decision are you going to make that's it and he that cannot stand chastisement but goes on with the world he's an illegitimate child and not a son and daughter of God certainly not now but the spiritual minded catches the word lines up with it and the spirit comes down under the shed blood and takes that person I want to be took I want to be cooked by God I want to be took by the world we've been taught by the world long enough I want to be took by God I want to read this one real quick because this is one of we read Wednesday night it was a paradox she was talking about the Hebrew children sometimes it looks like you know brother boy did we're heading toward the fiery furnace something in your life something that we have to overcome and we think man I'm gonna get burned up I'm gonna get burned up but let's talk about the three Hebrew children how that three men you know what they've done all they said was they didn't say I know the seals they said we're not bowing down to that image and you know what they said if we live we live if we die we die but we'll never bow down to that image we'll never bow down to that world and you know what there was there was a furnace right here that they they heated it seven times it was glowing and was so hot to when the people walked up to throw a man it killed them but what did it do to the three Hebrew children they didn't even smell smoke but what did it do they were bound they were bound you know they they never run away if they weren't bound they were going to give their life for what they believed in but they were bound and here they go they're headed into the fire furnace and all of a sudden brother Michael the bands are the only thing that got burned off what they thought was going to kill them the trouble in the trials we go through if you'll look at it that way hey I'm Bound by something when I get into that furnace I'm not even going to be touched by the smell of sin of this world but God is going to take these bonds and Bounds and he's just gonna ashes listen that's the only thing it did let's stand our feet that's the only thing it did see it delivered them from the bonds that they were bound with that was a paradox sometimes in their own life that Paradox repeats sometimes you're brought to a showdown where you have to make a decision you have to stand on that decision like they did and it look it all works together for the good what did it do it never hurt them it loosed them yeah sometimes we're caught in that position first thing you've got just like the man drowning in the river you got to get that man out of the river before you can get the river out of the man I like about that and that's something
