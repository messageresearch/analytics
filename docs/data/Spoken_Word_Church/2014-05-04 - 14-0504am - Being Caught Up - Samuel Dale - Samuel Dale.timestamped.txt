[7:05] and they said anna was sick so remember
[7:08] each one of these
[7:09] and you know and all and we're glad to
[7:12] have our visitors with us today and uh
[7:14] brother brother keith
[7:17] beasley him and his family we're glad to
[7:19] have him he's been here before but we we
[7:22] didn't recognize i told him i knew his
[7:24] face but i didn't know his his name but
[7:26] uh i appreciate him coming being with us
[7:28] and if i guess if he came to the

[7:37] one time second time you're just part of
[7:39] us because we we're just a part of the

[7:43] brother with us i think he's from over
[7:45] at canton he said so remember that also
[7:48] now to the kids especially to the boys
[7:51] some of you boys have been praying and
[7:53] playing pretty hard with sticks
[7:56] and
[7:57] one got stabbed in the neck with one and
[7:59] i don't understand boys playing with
[8:02] sticks
[8:03] when you're sharpening the end of them
[8:07] now that doesn't mean you're intending
[8:09] to just
[8:11] stick it in the ground
[8:14] right
[8:15] so boys now as girls too if you're
[8:17] getting into doing it but especially
[8:20] boys don't be getting out there and
[8:21] getting those big old sticks i've seen
[8:23] them with sticks this long and that big
[8:25] around you know swinging them and
[8:27] somebody can get hurt
[8:29] now don't do it and then you start
[8:31] sharpening the end of them off that
[8:32] means you intend to hurt somebody
[8:36] in order of your parents
[8:38] you need to check on these things
[8:40] you know whose kids is who
[8:43] you know i don't have to worry about it
[8:45] myself because they don't have a little
[8:46] bitty ones
[8:47] but some of you that's got some you need
[8:49] to uh check on things okay all right uh
[8:52] sister carnes gave me a uh prayer
[8:55] request that there's a lady in the floyd
[8:57] county hospital
[8:58] in very serious condition elderly person
[9:01] said they need uh she needs salvation so
[9:04] remember that all right remember just
[9:07] pray one for another and pray that the
[9:08] lord would bless each one of us amen
[9:11] is that all the announcements
[9:13] i think
[9:16] right wade will be in miami on the
[9:19] minute uh the fellowship meeting weekend
[9:21] and wade and june's going down to miami
[9:24] and he's going to be preaching a series
[9:26] down there for a brother
[9:27] uh
[9:28] so we pray that the lord would bless all
[9:30] right
[9:31] uh anything else
[9:33] if you like turn in your scripture turn
[9:35] to first thessalonians 4.
[9:38] and we'll read that and go right on into
[9:42] our thought for today
[9:44] let's see
[9:46] i write my notes down and i write some
[9:47] minutes
[9:48] sometimes i forget
[9:50] one or two of them but just remember
[9:52] these things
[9:54] first thessalonians 4.
[9:56] heavenly father we thank you for your
[9:58] loving your grace and to us lord and we
[10:00] thank you for all things we know that
[10:02] you've given to us freely and we
[10:04] appreciate that and we just ask you
[10:06] today now that you'd come among us lord
[10:08] and you knew before the foundation of
[10:10] the world that who would be here today
[10:12] and where we would be and what we would
[10:13] be saying and all of the things so we
[10:16] just ask you to come and manifest
[10:17] yourself
[10:19] through the word that is brought this
[10:21] day that we may walk therein forgive our
[10:24] sins and cleanse us from all
[10:26] unrighteousness be with the sick ones
[10:28] and just bless each one be brother day
[10:30] night his brothers ministering and just
[10:33] have you away with each and every one of
[10:35] us and lord we ask you to reach down and
[10:37] touch brother ernie filling the way with
[10:39] our lord because we still don't have any
[10:41] report of whether he's going to be able
[10:43] to be with us for the fellowship meeting
[10:45] but we pray that you would just bless
[10:47] him and let everything be all right let
[10:49] your love be made manifest to each one
[10:51] of us in jesus name amen
[10:55] very familiar scripture with us
[10:57] you know because of the message of the
[10:59] hour and we you know where we're adding
[11:02] things but let's just read it and get
[11:04] into a little thought for today
[11:06] verse 13 says but i would not have you
[11:08] to be ignorant brethren
[11:11] concerning them which are asleep that
[11:13] you saw or not even as others which have
[11:15] no hope
[11:16] for if we believe that jesus died and
[11:18] rose again
[11:20] even so them also which sleep in jesus
[11:24] will god bring with him
[11:26] now watch that for this we say unto you
[11:29] by the word of the lord
[11:31] that you
[11:32] that we which are alive and remain unto
[11:35] the coming of the lord
[11:37] shall not prevent no hindrance in
[11:40] them which are asleep
[11:42] all right
[11:44] now we know when we go over to hebrews
[11:46] later
[11:47] they're waiting on us
[11:48] all right so don't worry about it
[11:50] they're they're they're in their place
[11:53] but look for the lord himself shall
[11:55] descend from heaven with a shout that
[11:57] the voice of the archangel with the
[11:58] trumpet of god and the dead in christ
[12:00] shall rise
[12:02] first
[12:03] then we which are alive and remain shall
[12:05] be caught up together with them in the
[12:07] clouds to meet the lord in the hour and
[12:09] so shall we ever be
[12:11] with the lord you may be seated the lord
[12:14] had his blessing
[12:15] to the reading of the word
[12:18] now we've been for quite a while
[12:21] a few series that are speaking on
[12:24] uh that god does not change
[12:27] and then we were talking about
[12:30] that
[12:31] it's proven by hebrews 13 8
[12:35] that it's jesus christ the same
[12:37] yesterday today and forever
[12:40] and we've tried to bring it down on an
[12:42] understanding
[12:44] that if we truly believe in one true and
[12:46] living god you know in other words we we
[12:49] believe in one god we claim to believe
[12:51] in one god
[12:52] but we believe he changes
[12:55] well now what kind of a god would that
[12:56] be
[12:57] and remember how we brought it we we
[12:59] brought it and showing the prophet of
[13:01] god said
[13:02] that he doesn't change
[13:05] man changes but god does not change
[13:08] all right now if he does not change then
[13:11] we can depend on that if you have a god
[13:13] that changes
[13:15] then how can you depend upon anything to
[13:17] be accurate
[13:19] how can you read the bible if you
[13:20] believe god changes and believes the
[13:22] bible to be you're going to have to find
[13:25] and see and that's the point i've always
[13:26] made is people who say that god changes
[13:30] they're really telling you they're the
[13:32] ones that know where the changes are
[13:35] and you know they're trying to be the
[13:37] big guy to show you where it changes
[13:40] but if he changes then we're in bad
[13:43] shape
[13:44] all right so then the
[13:46] jehovah the old testament
[13:49] is the jesus of the new.
[13:51] okay now we made an emphasis of a point
[13:54] there
[13:55] that brother branham says paul was the
[13:58] one that had that understanding
[14:00] the others didn't follow that
[14:02] understanding totally well now what was
[14:04] he getting at
[14:06] uh did peter believe in the trinity
[14:08] no no no no remember he opened the doors
[14:10] you know all right remember all of that
[14:12] so remember my point was trying to get
[14:15] you to see peter saw the jehovah the old
[14:19] as the jesus of the new because he
[14:20] believed in one true and living god but
[14:23] he didn't bring it down into
[14:26] revelation expansion and things that
[14:29] paul went into
[14:31] as he began to speak on
[14:34] the coming of the lord the different
[14:35] things you know and bringing it down to
[14:39] the point
[14:40] and and
[14:42] you know that way then we look at it and
[14:44] say well
[14:46] you know i believe in one god
[14:48] well good
[14:49] we good old baptists
[14:51] that's the baptist doctrine
[14:54] one god
[14:56] huh you go to any baptist church you
[14:59] want to and they'll say we believe in
[15:00] one god that's our doctrine
[15:03] so explain it well we don't know how to
[15:06] explain it said even billy graham and us
[15:08] can't explain it but we kind of believe
[15:10] that it might be god in three persons
[15:14] well now if it's god in three persons
[15:16] blessed trinity then he's chained
[15:18] somewhere
[15:20] because you got three persons or
[15:21] personalities so you got a changing
[15:24] point
[15:25] and remember the thing that i gave you
[15:26] to lice the other day
[15:29] you know you say well god in a way
[15:32] is the sign
[15:35] now
[15:37] your prophet made a good emphasis on the
[15:39] point that i gave you
[15:41] just run it in your computer
[15:44] the mule is the one that says
[15:48] that he's not always the same
[15:53] the mule
[15:55] is the one that says
[15:58] that he changes
[16:00] now we know who the mule represents
[16:03] you know
[16:05] not that guy out there you know that
[16:07] pulled the plow
[16:08] the mule
[16:10] yeah you know he has no
[16:12] connection or seed of his own or
[16:14] anything
[16:15] and see the mule is the one that says
[16:17] well god in a way now
[16:23] no
[16:24] i remember in the baptist church it
[16:26] really struck me and i was studying it
[16:28] back then
[16:29] because i noticed one day talking about
[16:32] that little word way
[16:33] and it struck me
[16:35] and i got to looking of how many times
[16:37] in the bible that jesus would speak of
[16:40] the way
[16:41] and when he come around to say i am the
[16:43] way
[16:45] the i am the way
[16:47] amen the ever-present god was the way
[16:51] all right and and you know that stuck
[16:54] with me all down through there then when
[16:55] the prophet began to talk about that god
[16:58] doesn't change then i could associate
[17:01] with that because
[17:02] i
[17:03] believe the word
[17:05] you know and i still believe the word
[17:07] all right
[17:08] now
[17:09] what have we been talking about
[17:13] the prophet says that our biggest
[17:16] problem
[17:17] is that we
[17:19] look forward
[17:21] to something to come
[17:23] we look back to what has been
[17:27] right
[17:28] and see bring it on up where we're
[17:30] living all right
[17:32] looking back to where the prophet was
[17:34] here
[17:36] and the things
[17:38] and looking forward to
[17:40] somebody to come and straighten this
[17:42] whole thing out you know
[17:45] isn't that kind of what people are doing
[17:47] you know
[17:48] and that's why they run after all of
[17:49] these doctrines that everything jumps up
[17:51] and and everybody grabs it and runs a
[17:54] while
[17:55] but
[17:56] the prophet said it like this what
[17:59] he said
[18:01] we look back and we look forward but he
[18:04] said we fail to look at what's taking
[18:07] place
[18:09] we look back to luther's message of the
[18:12] just you live by faith
[18:14] right
[18:16] and we can look forward to something to
[18:18] come
[18:20] but do we look at that message even
[18:22] today that i truly believe
[18:25] in the just shall live by faith
[18:28] i believe that
[18:30] see
[18:31] because
[18:32] then it's supposed to be with the
[18:34] burning bush when he says
[18:36] who am i going to go down he said in
[18:38] other words
[18:39] moses i like the point and i emphasize
[18:41] it always that moses when god appeared
[18:43] to him at the burning bush he said who
[18:45] are you
[18:46] he said i'm the god of abraham isaac and
[18:47] jacob i said come on i'm sending you to
[18:49] egypt he said uh-uh i'm not going
[18:54] now that was a pretty good uh
[18:57] invitation or direction or something of
[18:59] the god of abraham isaac and jacob
[19:03] but he said in other words paraphrasing
[19:05] it put in our language moses said
[19:08] i'm not going until you give me
[19:10] something personal
[19:13] that i can go down there and talk about
[19:16] he said okay
[19:18] i am
[19:19] that i am
[19:21] moses said okay we're going to egypt
[19:25] see he had something personal
[19:27] martin luther no telling how many times
[19:29] he had spoken to just shall live by
[19:31] faith
[19:33] but yet one day that came off the pages
[19:35] into his life and
[19:37] and all that and he challenged the world
[19:42] and telling them the truth
[19:44] or the just you live by faith
[19:46] when are we going to get to the places
[19:49] that we
[19:50] see this message
[19:52] that we believe and we quote it we talk
[19:55] about it that we're in the end time and
[19:57] we've got this great message and there's
[20:00] not something else to coming down or
[20:02] some other prophet to show up on the
[20:04] scene to do this at the other and we
[20:07] believe the life's gentile prophet was
[20:09] here
[20:11] when are we going to start believing
[20:12] what he said amen
[20:15] well i believe everything he said
[20:16] brother dale
[20:19] yeah
[20:20] and there's people sitting in churches
[20:21] today playing tapes
[20:24] that he said
[20:26] you needed to file for ministry
[20:28] oh i don't believe that now
[20:30] in a way
[20:34] right
[20:36] you know what i mean by the way
[20:38] you know we're not too far from people
[20:39] that play tapes and things but you know
[20:42] what when they got a funeral
[20:45] or a wedding
[20:47] or a baby to dedicate they call brother
[20:49] dale
[20:53] well why don't the tape recorder bury
[20:55] him
[20:59] and i'm not sarcastic
[21:01] that's what i sound like but it's just
[21:02] the truth
[21:04] pay your tithe to the tape recorder
[21:10] go ask the tape recorder what you ought
[21:11] to do in this situation in that
[21:13] situation
[21:15] yeah you know see that's that's their
[21:17] business i'm not
[21:18] hey we got too many in here we keep on
[21:21] we're going to have to build on i want
[21:22] to run some of you off
[21:28] you know i don't mean that i never have
[21:31] but i do mean one thing
[21:33] a lot of you i tell my wife the other
[21:35] day a lot of you have made me set up a
[21:38] great record
[21:40] because a lot of you has come to this
[21:42] church and stayed longer than you ever
[21:44] did anywhere else
[21:46] that's a good record
[21:49] hey
[21:50] you've been here longer than you've been
[21:51] anywhere else
[21:54] well
[22:00] you just shouldn't be that
[22:02] shouldn't talk plain well why not
[22:05] all right
[22:06] but now brother colley's been with me
[22:08] brother dougherty brother colley's been
[22:09] with us the longest
[22:11] 1971
[22:13] brother colin brother dardy came to
[22:14] church here and right after we started
[22:16] the church
[22:17] and i mean this honestly i love brother
[22:19] collin from the bottom of my heart
[22:21] but if i knew that i could say brother
[22:23] colley
[22:24] you're ugly
[22:27] and that would hurt his feelings to make
[22:29] him leave
[22:33] you know
[22:34] he'd leave because i'd say he's ugly
[22:39] well you know what i'm just i'm i'm
[22:41] sorry
[22:43] i just go tell him you're ugly
[22:46] why because he's wanting to leave
[22:49] he's wanting a reason to leave
[22:52] if he knew you want a reason to leave
[22:53] tell me what i can say i don't mean
[22:56] something off the message
[22:58] i don't mean something different from
[22:59] the bible
[23:00] i just mean some something
[23:03] he said well you shouldn't be that plain
[23:05] why not
[23:06] if you're here on because of the good
[23:08] looks or this that or the other or the
[23:10] good things i talk to you about now i
[23:12] brag on you you're in bad shape
[23:15] but if we're here for the word
[23:20] for 45 years i've tried to preach jesus
[23:24] christ the same yesterday today and
[23:25] forever
[23:27] first sermon of priests i've told you
[23:29] how many times
[23:31] 1969
[23:33] was that the bride of jesus christ would
[23:35] be the son of man
[23:39] the word made flesh in the last days
[23:44] that was the first sermon i preached
[23:48] why don't we believe something personal
[23:52] that's all i've tried to get
[23:54] me not to look forward
[23:56] not to look backward i'm looking forward
[23:59] right
[24:00] the prophet was looking forward
[24:02] he said there'll come a such a baptism
[24:05] of the holy ghost out of heaven
[24:07] one day
[24:08] and we'll go out of here we'll get to it
[24:09] lord willing this evening in a rapture
[24:12] he was looking forward to something and
[24:14] he looked back to the things that god
[24:16] had done in his life
[24:19] but he had something present
[24:22] right
[24:24] that's all i want to talk about
[24:27] is a present tense god
[24:30] something that's real
[24:32] and see then after we get through with
[24:34] this i don't know how much longer we'll
[24:35] be on this part but i want to talk about
[24:38] the coming of the lord
[24:40] i don't want to talk about it as a
[24:43] historical nor a future i want to talk
[24:46] about everything right now
[24:50] if we don't see him real right now
[24:53] tomorrow is worth nothing
[24:56] the past is gone
[25:00] when are we going to realize reality
[25:04] and say lord
[25:07] i am means ever present
[25:10] for eternity
[25:13] that's what it means at the burning bush
[25:14] i can show you that's off the message
[25:17] and whom shall we go
[25:20] i am is ever-present
[25:23] the same god of the old testament
[25:26] is the same god of the new testament
[25:29] or something changed some were right
[25:33] but if he didn't change we can depend on
[25:35] it right
[25:37] and believe it
[25:40] but see i like to approach things in a
[25:42] way to get you to thinking
[25:46] i want you to think about
[25:48] the message that's what sister gail said
[25:50] the brother makes you this makes you
[25:52] feel good and this makes you there i
[25:53] said brother that makes you think well
[25:56] that's what i want you to do
[25:57] i mean feeling good is wonderful i love
[25:59] it
[26:01] but i like something i can chew on for a
[26:03] while
[26:04] you know what
[26:05] and tomorrow i can think about it
[26:08] and remember it
[26:10] and i just
[26:12] you know and i know i do things
[26:13] strangely and i'm sorry but that's me
[26:18] but i want to turn to us and brother
[26:21] anderson can go ahead and pull it up
[26:25] in psalms 27
[26:30] and read
[26:32] the five verses
[26:35] that brother branham used to preach the
[26:38] message called the rapture
[26:45] he used these five verses
[26:50] now you you read what you want to get
[26:54] people
[26:55] a thought in their mind or something
[26:59] you know
[27:01] you you give your your main point is a
[27:03] scripture you start with and that's got
[27:06] your whole message involved
[27:08] in that one scripture
[27:11] and you're thinking
[27:13] this right here will
[27:16] is what came to me
[27:18] to speak about the rapture
[27:23] but i want you to read it
[27:28] and i want you to find
[27:31] in there
[27:33] the rapture
[27:36] now later on in the message yes
[27:38] he goes to thessalonians that i read
[27:43] but this is his basics of his foundation
[27:48] this is where
[27:50] he speaks of the rapture
[27:55] i want us just to read it and consider
[27:57] it
[28:03] the psalmist david says what a psalm of
[28:05] david there wonderful
[28:07] the lord is my light and my salvation
[28:11] whom shall i fear
[28:13] the lord is the strength of my life
[28:16] whom shall i be afraid
[28:20] now
[28:23] when the wicked even my enemies and my
[28:25] foes came upon me to eat up my flesh
[28:29] they stumble and fail
[28:32] though in whole shouldn't count against
[28:34] me
[28:35] my heart shall not fear
[28:37] no war should rise against me
[28:40] and this will i be confident
[28:43] one thing i have desired of the lord
[28:46] that i will seek after that i may dwell
[28:48] in the house of the lord all the days of
[28:50] my life
[28:51] to behold the beauty of the lord and
[28:54] then to inquire in his temple
[28:57] for in the time of trouble he shall hide
[28:59] me
[29:00] in his pavilion
[29:02] in the secret of his tabernacle shall he
[29:04] hide me
[29:06] he shall set me up on a rock
[29:10] now
[29:13] read that over and over and over while
[29:16] i'm talking
[29:19] where is there any connection that you
[29:21] can think of
[29:23] to the word rapture we know it's we'll
[29:25] get to it in a minute the word rapture
[29:26] is not in the bible the word is caught
[29:29] up
[29:30] the word rapture is a modern day
[29:32] terminology
[29:35] the word rapture means an ecstasy
[29:38] or a delight or carrying up different
[29:41] things yeah but it's not in the bible
[29:43] the word rapture is not there
[29:46] i want you to read that over and over
[29:48] where do you get a rapture from that
[29:50] brother
[29:52] branham why did you not read first
[29:55] thessalonians
[29:59] as your main
[30:01] scripture
[30:04] for the rapture
[30:08] yet you go to a scriptures that
[30:13] has
[30:15] almost no future
[30:19] points spoken of in it
[30:26] come on church
[30:30] we claim to believe a prophet that the
[30:33] word of the lord is to come to
[30:39] but read that scripture where is there
[30:41] any thoughts
[30:45] as to some form of caught up
[30:54] but yet he uh
[30:59] he said that was his scripture
[31:05] but i want you to read with it and just
[31:07] think a little bit
[31:12] verse 1 he says the lord is my
[31:15] light
[31:17] in my salvation
[31:20] there's no past to that
[31:22] and there's no future to that
[31:26] it's present tense
[31:28] right
[31:29] he is
[31:30] my light and my salvation
[31:34] whom shall i fear
[31:38] present tense
[31:41] the lord is the strength of my life
[31:43] present tense
[31:46] whom shall i be afraid
[31:52] how many of you afraid about
[31:55] something tomorrow
[32:00] right
[32:02] uh are you afraid about something
[32:04] yesterday
[32:06] no that's done pisces it can't happen
[32:07] again
[32:13] let's really think about something
[32:16] verse two
[32:18] when
[32:20] the wicked
[32:24] looks like future but listen
[32:26] even my enemies and my foes
[32:30] came
[32:32] upon me
[32:35] as present tense
[32:39] he didn't say will come upon me
[32:42] he said came upon me that's
[32:45] i'm not very good on english but that's
[32:47] not even good
[32:48] uh
[32:50] speeching speaking
[32:54] they came upon me
[32:57] to eat up my flesh
[32:59] they stumbled and fell
[33:03] he could relate to his whole life
[33:06] that everybody that had ever come
[33:08] against him had never been able to
[33:12] withstand him
[33:15] right
[33:18] we get the point
[33:20] when they came upon me
[33:25] going host
[33:27] should encount against me
[33:35] present
[33:36] tense my heart
[33:40] shall not fear
[33:45] present tense
[33:50] though war should rise against me
[33:56] something later on down the road
[33:59] about the only thing he's speaking of a
[34:01] future point
[34:03] and this will i be confident
[34:06] what
[34:10] i'm not going to fear
[34:14] one thing have i desired of the lord
[34:20] that will i seek after
[34:26] that i may dwell
[34:28] some of these days
[34:30] maybe i will i hope i get to be there
[34:34] that i may dwell in the house of the
[34:36] lord
[34:38] all the days of my life
[34:43] to behold the beauty of the lord and
[34:46] then inquire in his temple where's any
[34:48] future
[34:52] see we're supposed to live day by day
[35:01] for in the time of trouble
[35:07] he shall hide me in his pavilion
[35:10] in the secret of his tabernacle shall he
[35:12] hide me
[35:13] he shall set me up on a rock
[35:17] very little is spoken of future
[35:19] events
[35:24] because we're not supposed to think
[35:25] about future tense
[35:27] the past is gone and tomorrow's not here
[35:34] you cannot do anything about tomorrow
[35:36] except change the day
[35:38] what you're doing to maybe
[35:40] make tomorrow different
[35:43] right amen
[35:45] you can't bring it to pisces
[35:48] why because
[35:50] you're living right now
[35:55] to me the entire bible
[35:57] is not trying to get us to see future
[36:00] things
[36:03] it's trying to get us to see what's
[36:04] going on
[36:08] if not why are we at church
[36:11] well tomorrow
[36:13] right
[36:15] do you understand me
[36:18] if it's something tomorrow well tomorrow
[36:21] all we got to do is find get somebody to
[36:23] tell us when tomorrow gets here well you
[36:26] know what when tomorrow gets yours today
[36:32] the bible doesn't say tomorrow is the
[36:34] day of salvation what does it say today
[36:37] is the day of salvation
[36:41] well yesterday no yesterday was when it
[36:43] was made possible
[36:50] are you listening
[36:54] why would a prophet use this
[36:57] to speak up when there's so many
[36:58] scriptures
[37:02] that he could relate to about a rapture
[37:14] you see i know that what my job is is to
[37:17] stir you up and make you think
[37:19] about some things i'm not to try to
[37:21] interpret the prophet's message
[37:23] i'm not doing that i'm trying to get you
[37:25] an eye to see something present tense
[37:29] grandma's god
[37:33] might be okay
[37:35] remember most of our stalks would say
[37:38] grandma's god was a trinity
[37:41] right
[37:44] mom and daddy's god was a trinity
[37:50] and we say we believe in one god so
[37:52] something changed somewhere
[37:58] you ever heard people say my mama was a
[38:01] baptist and i guess i'll die baptist
[38:06] because mama was a baptist if it was
[38:08] good enough for mama
[38:10] it's good enough for me
[38:17] well
[38:18] why don't you walk across the street
[38:23] is that all i need to say to get you to
[38:24] go across the street
[38:26] to and i'm not doing off on them we're
[38:28] going with our because they believe in
[38:29] the trinity
[38:32] they believe what grandma believed
[38:34] if you're going to heaven with grandma
[38:36] you need to go over there
[38:44] right
[38:49] you're just too stubborn brother dale
[38:51] you're too blunt plain
[38:53] why
[38:55] my soul is involved remember the other
[38:57] day hebrews 13 8 it's based upon 13 7.
[39:03] them that have rule over you
[39:05] consider the end of their conversation
[39:08] jesus christ the same yesterday today
[39:10] and forever and brother branham said if
[39:11] your pastor don't preach
[39:14] jesus christ the same in every way what
[39:17] did he say
[39:18] get away from him
[39:20] i gave you the quote last week
[39:26] well i'm just going to stay here
[39:29] what's the difference in saying i'm
[39:30] going to stay here then saying
[39:32] mama believed in the trinity i'm going
[39:34] to believe man i'm going to be a baptist
[39:36] because mama was a baptist
[39:41] what's the difference
[39:44] but you see that's why i'm not popular
[39:45] because that's the way i talk and that's
[39:47] the way i've always talked
[39:50] i've never talked about a god of
[39:52] tomorrow or a god of yesterday
[39:54] i've always tried to talk to you about a
[39:56] god of today
[40:02] something real
[40:03] we look back and see what god brought us
[40:05] a message wonderful
[40:08] thank god for the message because you
[40:09] and i couldn't understand nothing
[40:11] without the prophet's message
[40:18] but i wasn't the prophet that said
[40:21] the fifo ministry was for the perfecting
[40:23] of the saints
[40:26] he's the one that said that
[40:28] the bible said it
[40:30] amen that's right
[40:34] well in a way
[40:36] and all people that's the mule right
[40:40] in a way
[40:42] you hurt my feelings good
[40:46] you'll pray
[40:50] right
[40:51] told him like not in the bible study i
[40:52] said we need somebody to come against us
[40:55] we've been running too smooth
[40:58] we need somebody to come against us why
[41:01] because you always do better the prophet
[41:02] said under persecution
[41:07] they started the doctrine 40 something
[41:09] years ago the two souls
[41:13] you know that made me desperate
[41:15] i wanted to know how many souls i had
[41:19] and what i was
[41:22] but then i began to study it and found
[41:25] out you know that god himself
[41:32] not having a soul
[41:34] he was a soul
[41:36] a being a person
[41:39] there must needs be heresies among you
[41:41] the bible says that they that are
[41:43] approved may be made manifest
[41:48] look what your prophet is saying now
[41:55] and let's get into this now we've we've
[41:57] been into the psalmist
[41:59] and we haven't found much there to to
[42:02] direct us to
[42:03] seemingly a future thing
[42:06] of a rapture like we think
[42:09] so maybe we should consider
[42:11] why he used those things
[42:13] as to try to get us to look at things
[42:16] right now
[42:18] present tense
[42:21] now let's read
[42:22] the one we started off reading with
[42:25] first thessalonians 4.
[42:28] let's read down
[42:32] because we'll read down here in a minute
[42:33] where the prophet said the word rapture
[42:35] is not in the bible it's caught up and
[42:38] we'll read that but let's read the
[42:39] scripture
[42:40] this we say unto you by the word of the
[42:42] lord that we which are alive and remain
[42:43] unto the coming of the lord shall not
[42:45] prevent them which are asleep present
[42:47] tense
[42:50] we're not going to hinder those that are
[42:51] asleep and we can't do anything about
[42:53] the future
[42:55] so seemingly this is the scripture
[42:57] is relating to the psalmist
[43:01] watch
[43:03] for the lord himself shall descend from
[43:05] heaven with a shout
[43:08] with the voice of the archangel and with
[43:09] the trump of god
[43:11] and the dead in christ shall rise first
[43:14] all right
[43:18] now we'll get to it in a minute
[43:21] where the prophet says jesus does all
[43:23] three of these
[43:24] shout
[43:25] trumpet
[43:26] voice of arcane in his descending
[43:31] and he really calls it his appearing
[43:33] which when we get over into the coming
[43:35] of the lord you'll find there's a lot of
[43:36] difference between the word appearing
[43:39] and coming
[43:41] right
[43:43] all right
[43:45] but look then we which are alive and
[43:47] remain
[43:48] shall be caught up together with them
[43:53] what voice of the archangel and the
[43:55] trump of god and the dead in christ
[43:57] shall rise first
[44:00] so before there's a going away
[44:06] in rapture there has to be a dead raised
[44:09] first
[44:11] is that scripture
[44:14] it's not us going up in the rapture and
[44:16] then the dead starts raising
[44:25] are you listening
[44:28] see the dead in christ shall rise first
[44:33] then we which and we know for sure that
[44:35] jesus christ has to be here to raise the
[44:36] dead
[44:38] not physically here not corporally here
[44:40] not in a corporal body we don't do that
[44:42] we meet him in the millennium we meet
[44:44] him in the hour of preceding and going
[44:45] in the millennium with a corporal body
[44:47] so it's not a corporal body that jesus
[44:49] returns here to raise the dead
[44:55] but then we which are alive and remained
[44:59] shall be caught up together with them in
[45:01] the clouds
[45:03] to meet the lord in the iron so shall we
[45:05] ever be with the lord
[45:08] somebody talks about a rapture when it's
[45:11] something when that pope comes out of
[45:12] the united states we're going in rapture
[45:16] when warren becomes president we're
[45:17] going in rapture
[45:21] you see you're silly
[45:24] am i
[45:26] is that what everybody's waiting on
[45:32] well
[45:33] yes we got it made for another four
[45:35] years
[45:40] ain't no woman in the white house
[45:52] ain't no pope out of the united states
[45:54] so this guy's got to die
[46:00] but you see that's where we got it all
[46:02] figured out like that moon
[46:04] blood moon and all these things
[46:06] everybody was talking about a few weeks
[46:07] ago and everybody was just oh what's
[46:09] going to happen with the blood moon
[46:13] the prophet said
[46:15] i'll show you
[46:18] or maybe i'm not using the word show you
[46:20] but it says something and he says
[46:23] that
[46:24] the moon turning to blood he said has
[46:26] already happened
[46:30] but we're looking for the moon to turn
[46:31] to blood and then something's going to
[46:32] take place he said it's already happened
[46:38] right
[46:42] so what are we doing church
[46:46] caught up
[46:48] the word rapture is not dire it's caught
[46:51] up
[46:52] the word caught up are caught
[46:55] in the greek
[46:57] is
[46:58] 7 26 they can put it up you can read it
[47:01] it means to catch up
[47:04] to take by force or catch away or pluck
[47:07] or catch or pull
[47:09] to seize carry off by force
[47:11] to seize on
[47:13] claim for oneself eagerly to snatch out
[47:18] or away
[47:20] from the prophet said the word rapture
[47:22] is not in the bible see the word rapture
[47:24] according webster is a
[47:27] estacy
[47:30] you know
[47:32] it's a it's not a physical
[47:36] you know
[47:37] what webster gives you it's not a
[47:38] physical taking place
[47:41] it's an ecstasy of being caught up
[47:46] something happening
[47:48] you know
[47:50] and that's what gets me
[47:54] if somebody can stand and tell you that
[47:56] they preached for 45 years jesus christ
[47:58] was saying yesterday today and forever
[48:00] and never followed after all these
[48:02] doctrines
[48:03] that all these other preachers has
[48:05] followed well yet they'd rather be
[48:07] caught up in an ecstasy
[48:09] by some preacher that can
[48:11] run and make you feel good and boy ain't
[48:13] that something the lord he's got to come
[48:15] in 73 and a half
[48:19] well that didn't work 77.
[48:22] that then whitey
[48:26] ecstasies
[48:34] not against people with their anointings
[48:35] and their things
[48:38] what i'm against is the people
[48:42] i remember one brother this lady was
[48:44] saying something that the preacher said
[48:46] said boy wasn't that something i caught
[48:48] up in the ecstasy he said my lord lady
[48:50] that ain't even in the bible
[48:53] yeah but it's a good point
[48:57] ecstasies
[48:59] you know
[49:01] does it mean to be caught up
[49:07] all right go ahead and read it word of
[49:09] people out there i'll get it the rapture
[49:10] paragraph 128.
[49:16] go ahead and pull up number three
[49:18] so the word rapture in the bible
[49:21] is not even used at all
[49:23] we just put that word there
[49:25] the bible says caught up
[49:28] being caught up
[49:34] and we're glad to get over there where
[49:35] we're talking about in peter where it
[49:37] says being born again
[49:41] means a process that's going on
[49:45] right is that what peter said
[49:47] caught up being caught up
[49:54] we read here in second test alone our
[49:56] first test alone it's the order of this
[49:59] great rapture
[50:03] that will take place in the last days
[50:12] being caught up is in the order
[50:15] of this great
[50:17] order is like one thing after another
[50:19] one you know
[50:21] series is
[50:22] following
[50:24] order of events
[50:26] one transpires another transpires you
[50:28] can't put this one over here that's what
[50:30] we'll get to the second coming of the
[50:32] lord
[50:33] when you've got three things to be
[50:35] considered in the second coming of the
[50:37] lord and if you cross your scriptures up
[50:39] look what you've goofed up
[50:42] you can't apply this coming to that
[50:43] coming to that coming
[50:45] each one of them must be applied
[50:47] individually in the right order
[50:53] all right
[50:58] he said first thessalonians
[51:01] is the order of this great rapture
[51:06] then he reads
[51:08] starting with the 13th verse
[51:11] and he goes down
[51:15] and using the word caught up
[51:18] technically he stops one verse shy but
[51:22] just to let you know i do know how to
[51:23] read
[51:27] but you know
[51:29] another man one time
[51:32] he talked about being caught up
[51:39] second corinthians 12.
[51:44] paul
[51:47] talking about such as one whether in the
[51:49] body or not i cannot tell
[51:51] since he's one caught up
[51:53] to the third heaven
[51:56] he said he couldn't tell whether he was
[51:58] in the body or out of the body but
[52:01] he was caught up into paradise
[52:03] and heard unspeakable words which is not
[52:06] lawful for a man to utter
[52:09] you know what paul never left the earth
[52:13] right
[52:16] he said whether in body where they want
[52:19] now you say well how do you know that
[52:21] well when brother branham was caught up
[52:23] beyond the curtain of time remember
[52:26] we do
[52:27] have a prophet
[52:29] he said he looked back and seen his body
[52:31] still laying on the bed
[52:32] he wasn't there in a body that way he
[52:35] was there in theophany with the rest of
[52:37] them because that's what he said that's
[52:38] where they were
[52:39] all right
[52:41] so i'm not arguing with paul whether it
[52:43] was in body or not because he said he
[52:44] didn't know well that'd be stupid for me
[52:46] to argue with him about it that's right
[52:50] when he said he didn't know
[52:52] we know one thing
[52:54] he was caught up
[52:57] and he saw things that was
[53:01] unspeakable
[53:03] heard words
[53:06] caught up
[53:11] revelations 12.
[53:14] verse 4 and 5.
[53:18] it talks about the stars of heaven
[53:21] falling etc
[53:23] i know what this scripture means now so
[53:26] listen
[53:27] it's speaking of jesus christ
[53:29] and him coming back there but he's
[53:31] speaking of god going to israel in the
[53:33] finish of it okay
[53:36] now
[53:37] and she brought forth a man child unto
[53:40] men child who was to rule all nations
[53:41] with a rod of iron and her child was
[53:43] caught up unto him unto god
[53:45] and unto his throne
[53:47] that's what i said that means when jesus
[53:50] raised was taken up that means when the
[53:53] jews come over here was in revelation
[53:56] 12.
[53:58] but they used the word caught up
[54:02] the same as paul used the word caught up
[54:08] the same as brother branham said the
[54:09] word rapture is not there it's the word
[54:11] caught up
[54:18] revelations 4 1
[54:22] after this i looked and behold a door
[54:23] open in heaven and the first voice which
[54:25] i heard was were of a trumpet talking
[54:28] with me we said come up hither
[54:31] and i'll show you things that must be
[54:32] here after
[54:34] caught up
[54:36] we talk about john being caught up at
[54:38] the top of the rapture
[54:40] he was caught up
[54:43] did he leave the earth physically or
[54:51] but he definitely was caught up
[54:56] the two witnesses in revelations 11 and
[54:58] verse 12
[55:00] they heard a great voice from heaven
[55:02] saying unto them
[55:04] come up hither and they'll send it up to
[55:07] heaven in the cloud
[55:08] there any of you beheld them the word
[55:10] caught up was even a physical thing to
[55:12] them
[55:15] but it's the word caught up
[55:18] matthew 11 28
[55:22] jesus used the word caught up
[55:26] i mean he says come unto me all you that
[55:28] labor and are heavy laden
[55:30] and i'll give you rest
[55:33] caught up
[55:39] just remember the order that we read
[55:43] that the lord himself shall descend from
[55:44] heaven with a shout voice of an
[55:45] archangel a trumpet
[55:50] and remember the prophet said that jesus
[55:53] does all three in his descending because
[55:56] remember to take us dire he has to be
[55:59] here
[56:01] not in a corporal physical body standing
[56:06] brother brown said he'd be so
[56:08] visible among us that he would raise the
[56:11] dead and we'd go in the rapture
[56:15] right
[56:17] all right
[56:19] but remember the dead's got to raise
[56:22] first
[56:27] is that the
[56:28] bible the dead and christ will rise
[56:31] first and we would survive and remain
[56:32] shall be caught up
[56:37] now we're supposed to believe
[56:39] the prophet's message where he explains
[56:42] in the rapture message
[56:46] that the shout was the message
[56:49] going forth
[56:54] right
[56:57] you know what was his message
[56:59] right
[57:00] the whole message right
[57:02] yes
[57:06] we look for a shout as a great big
[57:08] holler you know somebody hey
[57:12] i told you about how dumb i was somebody
[57:14] told me one time that you'd be able to
[57:16] tell when the lord was coming because
[57:18] he's coming in the cloud and you looked
[57:20] in the cloud and you seen a rainbow i'm
[57:22] excuse me seen her umbrella
[57:24] you know i was told that when i was a
[57:26] kid well you know i remember that
[57:29] you know every time a cloud had to come
[57:30] up i'd go outside and look
[57:33] i got it made because ain't no umbrella
[57:38] you said are you dumb yeah stupid and so
[57:40] are you
[57:44] what did you think
[57:46] the lord himself shall descend from
[57:47] heaven with a shout hey
[57:52] now where would that be according to the
[57:54] bible that he calls it a secret coming
[57:58] as a thief in the night
[58:05] all right
[58:06] so the shout is the message
[58:10] that the prophet brought right right
[58:14] in case you ain't caught on
[58:17] i'm talking about something that
[58:19] is taking place
[58:21] and not something to look forward to it
[58:24] taking place
[58:26] are you following me
[58:28] maybe that'll click you to understand
[58:29] what i'm saying because i know the way i
[58:31] talk and things you get in them eyes go
[58:35] and they turn this away and you wonder
[58:37] what in the world are guys talking about
[58:40] because i'm not emotional to keep you
[58:42] going sister gale said or to walk down
[58:44] through the house now that does wake
[58:45] everybody up cause you don't know what
[58:47] i'm gonna step in the head
[58:50] you don't know what i'm going to do so
[58:53] i better wake up
[58:56] right
[58:59] come on
[59:02] but the lord himself shall descend from
[59:04] heaven jesus does all three of them
[59:06] so he descends from the heaven and what
[59:08] is the voice of the archangel
[59:11] he said the same loud voice that raised
[59:13] lazarus
[59:16] right yep
[59:19] the same loud voice that raised lazarus
[59:24] the dead would be raised by that voice
[59:28] and that voice
[59:30] is the message
[59:35] and a trumpet he says
[59:38] i believe it's the 10 virgins i'm
[59:40] 99 sure it's on there
[59:43] he's talking about this trumpet and he
[59:45] said a gospel trumpet or something
[59:50] we're looking for deducted after that
[59:54] gray's gonna open airplanes gonna be
[59:56] falling
[59:57] pilots are gone
[1:00:00] so the best thing to do when you get on
[1:00:01] an airplane is ask the pilot if he's a
[1:00:03] christian
[1:00:09] he says yes get off the plane
[1:00:13] you sound silly is it
[1:00:18] okay
[1:00:22] but are you listening to what i'm
[1:00:23] talking about
[1:00:26] we've had 40 something years to talk
[1:00:27] about a shout out a voice or an
[1:00:29] archangel in a trumpet
[1:00:34] but all that basically we hear is a
[1:00:36] quotation
[1:00:38] that the prophet says jesus does all
[1:00:40] three of these
[1:00:42] in his descending
[1:00:44] well are we looking for the descending
[1:00:45] of the lord
[1:00:50] when we've always caught we we've been
[1:00:52] taught all over a lot we're going to be
[1:00:53] caught up
[1:00:57] right
[1:01:00] when the prophet was talking about a
[1:01:02] descending
[1:01:04] or a condescending
[1:01:08] before they can be an easter ascending
[1:01:10] up there's got to be a condescending
[1:01:12] down
[1:01:21] a gospel trumpet or something
[1:01:25] don't you worry about it when the dead
[1:01:27] starts peering among us
[1:01:29] there's going to be a gospel trumpet
[1:01:36] it's not going to be
[1:01:39] well there's a dead one
[1:01:41] there's a dead one
[1:01:43] i think things are going on just a dead
[1:01:45] they'll get straitjacket
[1:01:47] right
[1:01:49] because that's what people are going to
[1:01:50] do
[1:01:52] all right
[1:01:55] the church have we heard his voice
[1:01:59] calling us up
[1:02:07] now
[1:02:09] i know i shouldn't be
[1:02:12] truthful and sarcastic but most
[1:02:14] preaching is beating you down instead
[1:02:23] and what few that does try to raise you
[1:02:24] up is they try to raise you up to say if
[1:02:26] you don't come be with us or believe our
[1:02:28] way
[1:02:29] you're gonna miss it
[1:02:35] but look what the prophet goes on to say
[1:02:37] because remember now jesus when he said
[1:02:39] coming to me all year labor and heavy
[1:02:41] laden he was calling us up
[1:02:45] to go to what he was speaking of
[1:02:48] we must be caught up
[1:02:51] i've got a lot more to say on this
[1:02:53] reason i'm just making a point
[1:02:55] because you see i thought we believe the
[1:02:57] bible it says that we're resurrected
[1:03:00] sitting in heavenly places
[1:03:04] in christ jesus
[1:03:10] i thought we believed that
[1:03:15] but see jesus was calling
[1:03:18] mankind up as we were talking about last
[1:03:20] night
[1:03:21] was jesus only speaking to the one
[1:03:23] standing there
[1:03:26] he did we don't know hope
[1:03:29] but can we take that scripture and
[1:03:31] realize that it's talking
[1:03:33] to you and i yeah
[1:03:36] come up
[1:03:40] if we don't have a new birth if we're
[1:03:42] not caught away in the new birth
[1:03:46] if we don't have a new birth then
[1:03:48] there's no rapture for us
[1:03:53] that is the word rapture caught up
[1:04:00] look what he said on the the seventh
[1:04:02] seal go ahead with number nine
[1:04:08] he's speaking from the seventh seal
[1:04:09] paragraph one
[1:04:12] and he gets down and he says and i pray
[1:04:13] heavenly father
[1:04:16] that that'll repeat again tonight
[1:04:18] that we could hear the voice of our lord
[1:04:21] calling us
[1:04:23] and calling us into to service for him
[1:04:26] closer wall we feel that we've heard his
[1:04:29] voice already in the opening of these
[1:04:31] seals
[1:04:32] speaking that it's the last day and the
[1:04:35] time is at hand grant these blessings
[1:04:36] that we ask
[1:04:40] we talked about the message being the
[1:04:42] shout
[1:04:43] out
[1:04:46] well then we should have at least heard
[1:04:47] the shout out
[1:04:54] heard it for 45 50 years going on now
[1:04:56] you know what a tape wise that we've had
[1:05:02] but where's the thing that to bring it
[1:05:04] to pass it is a certain brother that
[1:05:06] comes forth with a certain doctrine of
[1:05:08] certain ideas and and then why does
[1:05:10] everybody go to run an eye for them
[1:05:14] right
[1:05:19] see everybody's looking for something
[1:05:21] great to happen
[1:05:25] but are you looking for it being the
[1:05:27] word being revealed or an ecstasy
[1:05:31] of some
[1:05:32] physical emotions
[1:05:45] but how we heard his voice
[1:05:49] in the opening of the seals
[1:05:51] of course
[1:05:53] a big portion of the people of the
[1:05:54] message don't believe we need to hear
[1:05:56] anything about the seals right
[1:06:00] that's some deep things
[1:06:02] oh brother dale he gets out in them deep
[1:06:04] thing he he preaches seals he preaches
[1:06:07] daniel 70 weeks that's in deep things we
[1:06:09] don't want to get out there we might get
[1:06:11] all messed up
[1:06:13] folks
[1:06:14] don't worry about getting messed up
[1:06:16] we was born messed up
[1:06:22] don't worry about getting confused
[1:06:31] come on your prophet was the one that
[1:06:32] said it i didn't he said he cured a
[1:06:35] baptist bible and converted them to a
[1:06:37] baptist faith do you need that quote
[1:06:46] come on
[1:06:49] but what is the message done for us
[1:06:53] minus intellectual giants that can argue
[1:06:55] quotes
[1:06:57] like i told them last night see if
[1:06:59] you're talking to a baptist about one
[1:07:01] god he's gonna talk to you on the
[1:07:02] scriptures
[1:07:05] right
[1:07:07] he's gonna argue the scripture or some
[1:07:09] philosophy of so-and-so or some uh billy
[1:07:12] graham says we can't understand the
[1:07:14] trinity
[1:07:15] he might give you something like that
[1:07:16] but the people of this message
[1:07:19] most of them don't even quote you the
[1:07:21] scriptures or they don't know them
[1:07:23] and second off they got a quote
[1:07:29] kind of like a church of christ man said
[1:07:33] you quote your scripture said i got a
[1:07:34] scripture to shoot you down with
[1:07:38] is this a shooting down match
[1:07:44] if it's a quoting match we'll get us a
[1:07:45] jehovah witness go to the reading room
[1:07:55] what is it
[1:07:57] where's christ
[1:07:59] amen that's right
[1:08:01] that's it
[1:08:05] man he's certainly not in you because
[1:08:07] you're hateful and arrogant but the
[1:08:08] condo priest is nice
[1:08:10] glory go to the condo priest
[1:08:20] but church do you understand
[1:08:23] did the prophet use the psalmist
[1:08:26] as we read why did he just have to talk
[1:08:28] about a rapture
[1:08:31] and that's what he said
[1:08:38] when i tried to make my point to
[1:08:40] emphasize i'm gonna have to quit because
[1:08:42] we'll get to seed and take off again
[1:08:46] but in the psalms it was always
[1:08:49] something present tense to bring god on
[1:08:52] the scene to the psalmist david
[1:08:55] amen
[1:08:58] brother branham was the man that this
[1:09:00] message was alive in
[1:09:05] that's what caught me when i was a good
[1:09:06] old baptist i read the word
[1:09:09] i studied the word
[1:09:11] i didn't play around
[1:09:13] i argued with my brother he's a strict
[1:09:15] trinitarian and i didn't know how to
[1:09:17] explain it but i argued with him we'd
[1:09:19] set up at funerals how many older ones
[1:09:21] remember that
[1:09:23] you know you still you'd set up the dead
[1:09:24] all night long
[1:09:27] we'd be up all night long talking about
[1:09:28] the bible me and my brother
[1:09:30] he's a very intellectual person 12 years
[1:09:33] college
[1:09:35] and finally i told him one day when i
[1:09:37] seen it wasn't going any further i said
[1:09:39] from now on you quote a scripture i
[1:09:42] quote a scripture
[1:09:44] we ain't going to argue philosophies
[1:09:48] we're going to read the bible
[1:09:50] we never had another discussion
[1:09:53] it's honest
[1:09:56] why because he knew he couldn't handle
[1:09:58] the word
[1:10:02] he had been taught his philosophy
[1:10:07] but he said he couldn't stand the word
[1:10:10] when i quote him what the bible said
[1:10:12] jesus said unless you believe that i am
[1:10:14] he you will die in your sins
[1:10:17] now go ahead be like an old mule and
[1:10:19] hulk honk all you want to
[1:10:22] but do you understand what i'm getting
[1:10:23] at
[1:10:25] remember you can't be caught up until
[1:10:28] he's
[1:10:28] until a resurrection transpires
[1:10:36] come on
[1:10:38] the shout is the message the voice of
[1:10:39] the archangels the dead raising right
[1:10:42] then a trumpet the prophet said
[1:10:45] well curious he said like the gospel
[1:10:47] trumpet he said you know the trumpet
[1:10:49] when it sounds
[1:10:51] he said they found a trumpet back there
[1:10:54] and israel gathered
[1:10:58] have you ever looked up the word trumpet
[1:11:02] well i don't need to look it up i know
[1:11:03] what it is it's a bright horn
[1:11:10] you never looked up these words
[1:11:14] go look up trumpet and see if it don't
[1:11:15] go back to jubilee
[1:11:17] and remember now you'll find that
[1:11:20] jubilee is not jubilee in the bible it's
[1:11:22] jupiter j-u-b-i-l-e
[1:11:25] we call it
[1:11:26] j-u-v-i-l-e-e jubilee it's j-u-b-i-l-e
[1:11:32] so don't go looking for jubal i mean
[1:11:34] jubilee as we try to spell it with the
[1:11:36] two two e's on the end
[1:11:38] you don't find it in the scriptures
[1:11:41] once you go back and study the bible
[1:11:47] they sounded a gospel trumpet when the
[1:11:48] freedom came
[1:11:50] the time that it was to be a jubilee
[1:11:56] that same word jubilee back there comes
[1:11:58] exactly to the same word shout
[1:12:00] over in the new testament
[1:12:07] but you see we're wanting it to do this
[1:12:08] or that or the other we want to hear
[1:12:09] something
[1:12:12] and then somebody come along
[1:12:13] you know
[1:12:14] now i'm
[1:12:16] i'm trying to be funny
[1:12:18] but i'm trying to give an illustration
[1:12:20] you know somebody come along the
[1:12:21] preacher said have you heard the story
[1:12:23] said they saying in the papers now all
[1:12:25] over the internet that they some kind of
[1:12:27] trumpet sounding
[1:12:32] we need to get one of them machines to
[1:12:33] pick it up
[1:12:36] of course the guy that started the store
[1:12:37] he's the one selling the machine
[1:12:44] what can't you just see the people oh
[1:12:45] they got voices going on now they've
[1:12:48] been going on all alone
[1:12:55] your prophet is one that said it he said
[1:12:57] they could take a machine he said the
[1:13:00] words jesus was speaking and still going
[1:13:02] around the world
[1:13:08] what about it church
[1:13:12] paul caught up in the paradise
[1:13:14] the same word is caught up
[1:13:17] john caught up in revelation the same
[1:13:18] word as coda
[1:13:20] jesus said come unto me the same word is
[1:13:22] caught up
[1:13:26] have we heard his voice through the
[1:13:27] opening of the word
[1:13:29] come on
[1:13:30] now let me just say it for a second and
[1:13:31] then we'll come back to this this
[1:13:32] evening
[1:13:34] what are you trying to say brother dale
[1:13:35] okay
[1:13:40] i've taught you for 45 years one time
[1:13:44] the rapture is a process
[1:13:47] that is going on
[1:13:51] and if you don't have the new birth it's
[1:13:53] not even started for you
[1:13:56] the new birth is the most important
[1:13:57] thing in the world because only by the
[1:14:00] new birth can we hear the voice of god
[1:14:06] the day he was born again we'll get back
[1:14:08] to us this evening because some of you
[1:14:09] won't be here
[1:14:11] so i'll give it a little bit this
[1:14:12] morning make you interested at least
[1:14:20] when you got the new birth
[1:14:23] that's why
[1:14:24] that we don't believe
[1:14:26] the old denominational doctrine that
[1:14:28] we're going to get
[1:14:30] a new body
[1:14:32] you know another body
[1:14:34] word new is very deceiving
[1:14:38] we see most people preach we're going to
[1:14:40] get another body it's not this body
[1:14:43] we're going to get us another body
[1:14:46] and after all that brother branham said
[1:14:48] about it of throwing something down and
[1:14:50] picking the same thing back up the
[1:14:51] preachers in this message are still
[1:14:53] preaching we're going to get a new body
[1:14:57] after all he said we don't that even
[1:15:00] jesus would be there with nail prints in
[1:15:02] his hands that he raised with him now
[1:15:04] prince
[1:15:08] but we're going to get a new one you
[1:15:10] know why they don't believe that the
[1:15:12] blood of jesus christ is sufficient to
[1:15:14] redeem this one
[1:15:18] where are you gonna get it from mars
[1:15:21] jupiter
[1:15:24] you can't get it from here because this
[1:15:26] is garbage
[1:15:30] right
[1:15:33] but you see
[1:15:35] what if we got there one day and found
[1:15:37] out
[1:15:40] you remember the man that went to
[1:15:41] brother random and
[1:15:44] you remember he read a track
[1:15:47] and on that track it says where will you
[1:15:49] spend eternity some now if i miss the
[1:15:51] wording you just put it in it all right
[1:15:54] pretty close
[1:15:58] but the man read it
[1:16:00] he got concerned he started going
[1:16:01] everywhere
[1:16:03] he goes down to one place and they tell
[1:16:05] him you got to speak in tongues goes to
[1:16:08] another place you got to do this goes to
[1:16:10] another you got to do that
[1:16:12] you know he finally winds up with
[1:16:13] brother branham and he said
[1:16:16] i've went and done all that they've told
[1:16:17] me
[1:16:18] said what's wrong
[1:16:22] with random spoke to the man and he said
[1:16:27] you got it today you believed it
[1:16:30] he said you mean i've had it all alone
[1:16:33] and he says yes
[1:16:37] but that management torment
[1:16:39] trying to find what he already had
[1:16:44] what if it is that this message
[1:16:47] that we have received from a prophet of
[1:16:49] god
[1:16:51] is the very message that rapture and
[1:16:53] faith will lay in the books and the
[1:16:55] tapes that we read
[1:16:59] what if that's true
[1:17:05] then what are we looking for
[1:17:07] somebody to come and straighten it out
[1:17:10] straighten out what
[1:17:15] if you can straighten bread around them
[1:17:16] out you have to be almighty god
[1:17:23] not even another prophet wouldn't do no
[1:17:24] good to send it
[1:17:27] it would have to be god himself
[1:17:30] it would come if brother around him
[1:17:32] needed to be straightened out
[1:17:34] of course they didn't say that while he
[1:17:35] was alive
[1:17:37] but oh now
[1:17:39] what is that thing you can type in
[1:17:42] get all the people that's off the
[1:17:43] message
[1:17:46] believe the sign go home type it in your
[1:17:48] computer and find out how many preachers
[1:17:51] is now turned against
[1:17:53] the prophet
[1:17:55] to try to show how wrong
[1:17:58] he is
[1:18:01] they didn't do it when he was alive
[1:18:04] they had enough sense to not do it then
[1:18:11] what if we find out one day that the
[1:18:13] things we've been doing all these years
[1:18:15] of studying the message has been putting
[1:18:17] the word into the field for god to be
[1:18:20] able to quicken
[1:18:22] that's right
[1:18:25] and that from that
[1:18:27] jesus christ descends to the revealing
[1:18:29] of his word
[1:18:31] until he stands here in his people and
[1:18:34] calls the dead out of the ground come on
[1:18:40] and then we go up
[1:18:42] after the dead
[1:18:45] then we're caught up
[1:18:46] right
[1:18:49] the bible says will it be changed
[1:18:56] what are you saying brother dale
[1:18:58] i'm saying for 45 years i've tried to
[1:19:00] get you to see as a church
[1:19:02] that jesus christ is the same yesterday
[1:19:04] today and forever
[1:19:07] and that he is alive
[1:19:09] living in you and i
[1:19:11] come on musicians and we've seen the
[1:19:13] results of the dead being raised the
[1:19:16] sick being healed the word being spoken
[1:19:22] but you know nobody on the internet
[1:19:23] wants to call and see about who who was
[1:19:25] raised in the dead you know why they
[1:19:27] don't believe it
[1:19:29] well i'm glad they don't
[1:19:31] i don't have to answer the phone
[1:19:34] go gonna don't talk on the internet
[1:19:39] i don't do none of these text messages
[1:19:50] put my phone number's on the
[1:19:53] church website
[1:19:55] don't you call me tell me where i'm
[1:19:57] wrong
[1:19:59] because it'd be an honor to find out
[1:20:00] who's wrong
[1:20:01] because i can do something about it and
[1:20:03] get right
[1:20:06] i can change my ways
[1:20:13] you see that's all i've ever tried to
[1:20:15] get you to see
[1:20:16] jesus christ the same yesterday today
[1:20:18] and forever
[1:20:22] but nobody wants to hear
[1:20:25] the truth
[1:20:29] nobody's ever called me wanting to know
[1:20:31] how that i preached in 1974 and still
[1:20:34] got the tapes that we could pass the
[1:20:36] year 2026 and not break brother
[1:20:38] branham's message
[1:20:42] nobody wants to know
[1:20:45] they'd rather hear somebody make a
[1:20:46] prediction that don't come to fights
[1:20:48] make another prediction they don't come
[1:20:49] to fight make another one that don't
[1:20:51] come to vice
[1:20:58] see they don't want to hear the truth
[1:21:02] this message
[1:21:04] is the shout
[1:21:06] out
[1:21:08] and only after the message comes forth
[1:21:10] can you talk about the voice of the
[1:21:11] archangel
[1:21:14] and then you can talk about the trumpet
[1:21:19] but yet because i don't have the
[1:21:20] wonderful sweet delivery
[1:21:22] of the condo priest
[1:21:26] people label me as an intellectual
[1:21:30] what
[1:21:32] i'd like to know what i've said today as
[1:21:33] intellectual
[1:21:38] i've simply read the bible i simply said
[1:21:40] what the prophet said
[1:21:45] and i certainly haven't given you my
[1:21:46] concept of anything
[1:21:48] i've given you what the prophet had to
[1:21:49] say
[1:21:56] you see we're always waiting until
[1:21:57] tomorrow or depending on what was
[1:21:59] yesterday
[1:22:02] instead of believing something present
[1:22:04] tense
[1:22:05] and that prophet one day let's stand
[1:22:07] when he made a statement that was
[1:22:09] outstanding
[1:22:10] you remember this one he said i'm not
[1:22:12] looking for the coming of the lord
[1:22:16] he said i'm saying he's here
[1:22:21] that's what he
[1:22:22] said but yeah we're still looking for
[1:22:25] his coming he says he's here
[1:22:30] what about it
[1:22:33] and that prophet began to talk about a
[1:22:35] god that was real
[1:22:37] i listened
[1:22:40] listen god this is what we need
[1:22:44] we need this message
[1:22:48] i still believe it
[1:22:51] don't you
[1:22:52] go ahead what do we got 94 94 and 74 in
[1:22:56] the sparring but anybody have a need
[1:22:57] y'all are open
[1:23:00] we'll take up this scene in the rest of
[1:23:01] the message you have heard of little
[1:23:04] moses
[1:23:23] you want to be more concentrated to the
[1:23:24] lord
[1:23:26] and to pray for our family
[1:23:29] what else would we want
[1:23:32] that's a desire and an honest heart
[1:23:34] you know what
[1:23:35] he'll give you the very desire that you
[1:23:38] ask for
[1:23:39] we don't have to pray
[1:23:41] you've already said it
[1:23:43] there's no need to pray
[1:24:10] it will be glorious
[1:25:07] is
[1:25:24] we are
[1:25:38] god
[1:25:48] and he's the same now and he will be the
[1:25:50] same over there
[1:25:52] but we're not over
[1:26:02] lord i hope you hear me tomorrow
[1:26:20] dance
[1:26:40] me
[1:26:59] you
