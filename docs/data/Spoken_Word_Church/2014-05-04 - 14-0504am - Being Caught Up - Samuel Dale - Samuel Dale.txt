you i mean good to see everybody in the house of the lord this morning good to be here remember we had a real good time yesterday at the bible study and uh you were to come and be with us sometimes you might enjoy it you might get to to uh have some good lice and eat a lot of popcorn and talk about the word of the lord we went from romans yesterday all the way back into genesis and never did get out of genesis so we we get to having a good discussion you know we really had a good time amen now remember this coming saturday wade and i think where the bob's going uh maybe some of the other ministers will go to the minister's meeting that brother gerald hughes so remember that and remember the fellowship meeting will be here now on the third saturday which is the 17th the fight so remember that and uh just you know come and be with us we'll have a good time uh doing it i think brother gibby's down preaching for his brother today and they said anna was sick so remember each one of these and you know and all and we're glad to have our visitors with us today and uh brother brother keith beasley him and his family we're glad to have him he's been here before but we we didn't recognize i told him i knew his face but i didn't know his his name but uh i appreciate him coming being with us and if i guess if he came to the minister's meetings or something but if they haven't one of them hasn't been here we always say to you welcome one time second time you're just part of us because we we're just a part of the body of christ but glad to have her brother with us i think he's from over at canton he said so remember that also now to the kids especially to the boys some of you boys have been praying and playing pretty hard with sticks and one got stabbed in the neck with one and i don't understand boys playing with sticks when you're sharpening the end of them now that doesn't mean you're intending to just stick it in the ground right so boys now as girls too if you're getting into doing it but especially boys don't be getting out there and getting those big old sticks i've seen them with sticks this long and that big around you know swinging them and somebody can get hurt now don't do it and then you start sharpening the end of them off that means you intend to hurt somebody in order of your parents you need to check on these things you know whose kids is who you know i don't have to worry about it myself because they don't have a little bitty ones but some of you that's got some you need to uh check on things okay all right uh sister carnes gave me a uh prayer request that there's a lady in the floyd county hospital in very serious condition elderly person said they need uh she needs salvation so remember that all right remember just pray one for another and pray that the lord would bless each one of us amen is that all the announcements i think right wade will be in miami on the minute uh the fellowship meeting weekend and wade and june's going down to miami and he's going to be preaching a series down there for a brother uh so we pray that the lord would bless all right uh anything else if you like turn in your scripture turn to first thessalonians 4. and we'll read that and go right on into our thought for today let's see i write my notes down and i write some minutes sometimes i forget one or two of them but just remember these things first thessalonians 4. heavenly father we thank you for your loving your grace and to us lord and we thank you for all things we know that you've given to us freely and we appreciate that and we just ask you today now that you'd come among us lord and you knew before the foundation of the world that who would be here today and where we would be and what we would be saying and all of the things so we just ask you to come and manifest yourself through the word that is brought this day that we may walk therein forgive our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness be with the sick ones and just bless each one be brother day night his brothers ministering and just have you away with each and every one of us and lord we ask you to reach down and touch brother ernie filling the way with our lord because we still don't have any report of whether he's going to be able to be with us for the fellowship meeting but we pray that you would just bless him and let everything be all right let your love be made manifest to each one of us in jesus name amen very familiar scripture with us you know because of the message of the hour and we you know where we're adding things but let's just read it and get into a little thought for today verse 13 says but i would not have you to be ignorant brethren concerning them which are asleep that you saw or not even as others which have no hope for if we believe that jesus died and rose again even so them also which sleep in jesus will god bring with him now watch that for this we say unto you by the word of the lord that you that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the lord shall not prevent no hindrance in them which are asleep all right now we know when we go over to hebrews later they're waiting on us all right so don't worry about it they're they're they're in their place but look for the lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout that the voice of the archangel with the trumpet of god and the dead in christ shall rise first then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the lord in the hour and so shall we ever be with the lord you may be seated the lord had his blessing to the reading of the word now we've been for quite a while a few series that are speaking on uh that god does not change and then we were talking about that it's proven by hebrews 13 8 that it's jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever and we've tried to bring it down on an understanding that if we truly believe in one true and living god you know in other words we we believe in one god we claim to believe in one god but we believe he changes well now what kind of a god would that be and remember how we brought it we we brought it and showing the prophet of god said that he doesn't change man changes but god does not change all right now if he does not change then we can depend on that if you have a god that changes then how can you depend upon anything to be accurate how can you read the bible if you believe god changes and believes the bible to be you're going to have to find and see and that's the point i've always made is people who say that god changes they're really telling you they're the ones that know where the changes are and you know they're trying to be the big guy to show you where it changes but if he changes then we're in bad shape all right so then the jehovah the old testament is the jesus of the new. okay now we made an emphasis of a point there that brother branham says paul was the one that had that understanding the others didn't follow that understanding totally well now what was he getting at uh did peter believe in the trinity no no no no remember he opened the doors you know all right remember all of that so remember my point was trying to get you to see peter saw the jehovah the old as the jesus of the new because he believed in one true and living god but he didn't bring it down into revelation expansion and things that paul went into as he began to speak on the coming of the lord the different things you know and bringing it down to the point and and you know that way then we look at it and say well you know i believe in one god well good we good old baptists that's the baptist doctrine one god huh you go to any baptist church you want to and they'll say we believe in one god that's our doctrine so explain it well we don't know how to explain it said even billy graham and us can't explain it but we kind of believe that it might be god in three persons well now if it's god in three persons blessed trinity then he's chained somewhere because you got three persons or personalities so you got a changing point and remember the thing that i gave you to lice the other day you know you say well god in a way is the sign now your prophet made a good emphasis on the point that i gave you just run it in your computer the mule is the one that says that he's not always the same the mule is the one that says that he changes now we know who the mule represents you know not that guy out there you know that pulled the plow the mule yeah you know he has no connection or seed of his own or anything and see the mule is the one that says well god in a way now no i remember in the baptist church it really struck me and i was studying it back then because i noticed one day talking about that little word way and it struck me and i got to looking of how many times in the bible that jesus would speak of the way and when he come around to say i am the way the i am the way amen the ever-present god was the way all right and and you know that stuck with me all down through there then when the prophet began to talk about that god doesn't change then i could associate with that because i believe the word you know and i still believe the word all right now what have we been talking about the prophet says that our biggest problem is that we look forward to something to come we look back to what has been right and see bring it on up where we're living all right looking back to where the prophet was here and the things and looking forward to somebody to come and straighten this whole thing out you know isn't that kind of what people are doing you know and that's why they run after all of these doctrines that everything jumps up and and everybody grabs it and runs a while but the prophet said it like this what he said we look back and we look forward but he said we fail to look at what's taking place we look back to luther's message of the just you live by faith right and we can look forward to something to come but do we look at that message even today that i truly believe in the just shall live by faith i believe that see because then it's supposed to be with the burning bush when he says who am i going to go down he said in other words moses i like the point and i emphasize it always that moses when god appeared to him at the burning bush he said who are you he said i'm the god of abraham isaac and jacob i said come on i'm sending you to egypt he said uh-uh i'm not going now that was a pretty good uh invitation or direction or something of the god of abraham isaac and jacob but he said in other words paraphrasing it put in our language moses said i'm not going until you give me something personal that i can go down there and talk about he said okay i am that i am moses said okay we're going to egypt see he had something personal martin luther no telling how many times he had spoken to just shall live by faith but yet one day that came off the pages into his life and and all that and he challenged the world and telling them the truth or the just you live by faith when are we going to get to the places that we see this message that we believe and we quote it we talk about it that we're in the end time and we've got this great message and there's not something else to coming down or some other prophet to show up on the scene to do this at the other and we believe the life's gentile prophet was here when are we going to start believing what he said amen well i believe everything he said brother dale yeah and there's people sitting in churches today playing tapes that he said you needed to file for ministry oh i don't believe that now in a way right you know what i mean by the way you know we're not too far from people that play tapes and things but you know what when they got a funeral or a wedding or a baby to dedicate they call brother dale well why don't the tape recorder bury him and i'm not sarcastic that's what i sound like but it's just the truth pay your tithe to the tape recorder go ask the tape recorder what you ought to do in this situation in that situation yeah you know see that's that's their business i'm not hey we got too many in here we keep on we're going to have to build on i want to run some of you off you know i don't mean that i never have but i do mean one thing a lot of you i tell my wife the other day a lot of you have made me set up a great record because a lot of you has come to this church and stayed longer than you ever did anywhere else that's a good record hey you've been here longer than you've been anywhere else well you just shouldn't be that shouldn't talk plain well why not all right but now brother colley's been with me brother dougherty brother colley's been with us the longest 1971 brother colin brother dardy came to church here and right after we started the church and i mean this honestly i love brother collin from the bottom of my heart but if i knew that i could say brother colley you're ugly and that would hurt his feelings to make him leave you know he'd leave because i'd say he's ugly well you know what i'm just i'm i'm sorry i just go tell him you're ugly why because he's wanting to leave he's wanting a reason to leave if he knew you want a reason to leave tell me what i can say i don't mean something off the message i don't mean something different from the bible i just mean some something he said well you shouldn't be that plain why not if you're here on because of the good looks or this that or the other or the good things i talk to you about now i brag on you you're in bad shape but if we're here for the word for 45 years i've tried to preach jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever first sermon of priests i've told you how many times 1969 was that the bride of jesus christ would be the son of man the word made flesh in the last days that was the first sermon i preached why don't we believe something personal that's all i've tried to get me not to look forward not to look backward i'm looking forward right the prophet was looking forward he said there'll come a such a baptism of the holy ghost out of heaven one day and we'll go out of here we'll get to it lord willing this evening in a rapture he was looking forward to something and he looked back to the things that god had done in his life but he had something present right that's all i want to talk about is a present tense god something that's real and see then after we get through with this i don't know how much longer we'll be on this part but i want to talk about the coming of the lord i don't want to talk about it as a historical nor a future i want to talk about everything right now if we don't see him real right now tomorrow is worth nothing the past is gone when are we going to realize reality and say lord i am means ever present for eternity that's what it means at the burning bush i can show you that's off the message and whom shall we go i am is ever-present the same god of the old testament is the same god of the new testament or something changed some were right but if he didn't change we can depend on it right and believe it but see i like to approach things in a way to get you to thinking i want you to think about the message that's what sister gail said the brother makes you this makes you feel good and this makes you there i said brother that makes you think well that's what i want you to do i mean feeling good is wonderful i love it but i like something i can chew on for a while you know what and tomorrow i can think about it and remember it and i just you know and i know i do things strangely and i'm sorry but that's me but i want to turn to us and brother anderson can go ahead and pull it up in psalms 27 and read the five verses that brother branham used to preach the message called the rapture he used these five verses now you you read what you want to get people a thought in their mind or something you know you you give your your main point is a scripture you start with and that's got your whole message involved in that one scripture and you're thinking this right here will is what came to me to speak about the rapture but i want you to read it and i want you to find in there the rapture now later on in the message yes he goes to thessalonians that i read but this is his basics of his foundation this is where he speaks of the rapture i want us just to read it and consider it the psalmist david says what a psalm of david there wonderful the lord is my light and my salvation whom shall i fear the lord is the strength of my life whom shall i be afraid now when the wicked even my enemies and my foes came upon me to eat up my flesh they stumble and fail though in whole shouldn't count against me my heart shall not fear no war should rise against me and this will i be confident one thing i have desired of the lord that i will seek after that i may dwell in the house of the lord all the days of my life to behold the beauty of the lord and then to inquire in his temple for in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his pavilion in the secret of his tabernacle shall he hide me he shall set me up on a rock now read that over and over and over while i'm talking where is there any connection that you can think of to the word rapture we know it's we'll get to it in a minute the word rapture is not in the bible the word is caught up the word rapture is a modern day terminology the word rapture means an ecstasy or a delight or carrying up different things yeah but it's not in the bible the word rapture is not there i want you to read that over and over where do you get a rapture from that brother branham why did you not read first thessalonians as your main scripture for the rapture yet you go to a scriptures that has almost no future points spoken of in it come on church we claim to believe a prophet that the word of the lord is to come to but read that scripture where is there any thoughts as to some form of caught up but yet he uh he said that was his scripture but i want you to read with it and just think a little bit verse 1 he says the lord is my light in my salvation there's no past to that and there's no future to that it's present tense right he is my light and my salvation whom shall i fear present tense the lord is the strength of my life present tense whom shall i be afraid how many of you afraid about something tomorrow right uh are you afraid about something yesterday no that's done pisces it can't happen again let's really think about something verse two when the wicked looks like future but listen even my enemies and my foes came upon me as present tense he didn't say will come upon me he said came upon me that's i'm not very good on english but that's not even good uh speeching speaking they came upon me to eat up my flesh they stumbled and fell he could relate to his whole life that everybody that had ever come against him had never been able to withstand him right we get the point when they came upon me going host should encount against me present tense my heart shall not fear present tense though war should rise against me something later on down the road about the only thing he's speaking of a future point and this will i be confident what i'm not going to fear one thing have i desired of the lord that will i seek after that i may dwell some of these days maybe i will i hope i get to be there that i may dwell in the house of the lord all the days of my life to behold the beauty of the lord and then inquire in his temple where's any future see we're supposed to live day by day for in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his pavilion in the secret of his tabernacle shall he hide me he shall set me up on a rock very little is spoken of future events because we're not supposed to think about future tense the past is gone and tomorrow's not here you cannot do anything about tomorrow except change the day what you're doing to maybe make tomorrow different right amen you can't bring it to pisces why because you're living right now to me the entire bible is not trying to get us to see future things it's trying to get us to see what's going on if not why are we at church well tomorrow right do you understand me if it's something tomorrow well tomorrow all we got to do is find get somebody to tell us when tomorrow gets here well you know what when tomorrow gets yours today the bible doesn't say tomorrow is the day of salvation what does it say today is the day of salvation well yesterday no yesterday was when it was made possible are you listening why would a prophet use this to speak up when there's so many scriptures that he could relate to about a rapture you see i know that what my job is is to stir you up and make you think about some things i'm not to try to interpret the prophet's message i'm not doing that i'm trying to get you an eye to see something present tense grandma's god might be okay remember most of our stalks would say grandma's god was a trinity right mom and daddy's god was a trinity and we say we believe in one god so something changed somewhere you ever heard people say my mama was a baptist and i guess i'll die baptist because mama was a baptist if it was good enough for mama it's good enough for me well why don't you walk across the street is that all i need to say to get you to go across the street to and i'm not doing off on them we're going with our because they believe in the trinity they believe what grandma believed if you're going to heaven with grandma you need to go over there right you're just too stubborn brother dale you're too blunt plain why my soul is involved remember the other day hebrews 13 8 it's based upon 13 7. them that have rule over you consider the end of their conversation jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever and brother branham said if your pastor don't preach jesus christ the same in every way what did he say get away from him i gave you the quote last week well i'm just going to stay here what's the difference in saying i'm going to stay here then saying mama believed in the trinity i'm going to believe man i'm going to be a baptist because mama was a baptist what's the difference but you see that's why i'm not popular because that's the way i talk and that's the way i've always talked i've never talked about a god of tomorrow or a god of yesterday i've always tried to talk to you about a god of today something real we look back and see what god brought us a message wonderful thank god for the message because you and i couldn't understand nothing without the prophet's message but i wasn't the prophet that said the fifo ministry was for the perfecting of the saints he's the one that said that the bible said it amen that's right well in a way and all people that's the mule right in a way you hurt my feelings good you'll pray right told him like not in the bible study i said we need somebody to come against us we've been running too smooth we need somebody to come against us why because you always do better the prophet said under persecution they started the doctrine 40 something years ago the two souls you know that made me desperate i wanted to know how many souls i had and what i was but then i began to study it and found out you know that god himself not having a soul he was a soul a being a person there must needs be heresies among you the bible says that they that are approved may be made manifest look what your prophet is saying now and let's get into this now we've we've been into the psalmist and we haven't found much there to to direct us to seemingly a future thing of a rapture like we think so maybe we should consider why he used those things as to try to get us to look at things right now present tense now let's read the one we started off reading with first thessalonians 4. let's read down because we'll read down here in a minute where the prophet said the word rapture is not in the bible it's caught up and we'll read that but let's read the scripture this we say unto you by the word of the lord that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the lord shall not prevent them which are asleep present tense we're not going to hinder those that are asleep and we can't do anything about the future so seemingly this is the scripture is relating to the psalmist watch for the lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of the archangel and with the trump of god and the dead in christ shall rise first all right now we'll get to it in a minute where the prophet says jesus does all three of these shout trumpet voice of arcane in his descending and he really calls it his appearing which when we get over into the coming of the lord you'll find there's a lot of difference between the word appearing and coming right all right but look then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them what voice of the archangel and the trump of god and the dead in christ shall rise first so before there's a going away in rapture there has to be a dead raised first is that scripture it's not us going up in the rapture and then the dead starts raising are you listening see the dead in christ shall rise first then we which and we know for sure that jesus christ has to be here to raise the dead not physically here not corporally here not in a corporal body we don't do that we meet him in the millennium we meet him in the hour of preceding and going in the millennium with a corporal body so it's not a corporal body that jesus returns here to raise the dead but then we which are alive and remained shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the lord in the iron so shall we ever be with the lord somebody talks about a rapture when it's something when that pope comes out of the united states we're going in rapture when warren becomes president we're going in rapture you see you're silly am i is that what everybody's waiting on well yes we got it made for another four years ain't no woman in the white house ain't no pope out of the united states so this guy's got to die but you see that's where we got it all figured out like that moon blood moon and all these things everybody was talking about a few weeks ago and everybody was just oh what's going to happen with the blood moon the prophet said i'll show you or maybe i'm not using the word show you but it says something and he says that the moon turning to blood he said has already happened but we're looking for the moon to turn to blood and then something's going to take place he said it's already happened right so what are we doing church caught up the word rapture is not dire it's caught up the word caught up are caught in the greek is 7 26 they can put it up you can read it it means to catch up to take by force or catch away or pluck or catch or pull to seize carry off by force to seize on claim for oneself eagerly to snatch out or away from the prophet said the word rapture is not in the bible see the word rapture according webster is a estacy you know it's a it's not a physical you know what webster gives you it's not a physical taking place it's an ecstasy of being caught up something happening you know and that's what gets me if somebody can stand and tell you that they preached for 45 years jesus christ was saying yesterday today and forever and never followed after all these doctrines that all these other preachers has followed well yet they'd rather be caught up in an ecstasy by some preacher that can run and make you feel good and boy ain't that something the lord he's got to come in 73 and a half well that didn't work 77. that then whitey ecstasies not against people with their anointings and their things what i'm against is the people i remember one brother this lady was saying something that the preacher said said boy wasn't that something i caught up in the ecstasy he said my lord lady that ain't even in the bible yeah but it's a good point ecstasies you know does it mean to be caught up all right go ahead and read it word of people out there i'll get it the rapture paragraph 128. go ahead and pull up number three so the word rapture in the bible is not even used at all we just put that word there the bible says caught up being caught up and we're glad to get over there where we're talking about in peter where it says being born again means a process that's going on right is that what peter said caught up being caught up we read here in second test alone our first test alone it's the order of this great rapture that will take place in the last days being caught up is in the order of this great order is like one thing after another one you know series is following order of events one transpires another transpires you can't put this one over here that's what we'll get to the second coming of the lord when you've got three things to be considered in the second coming of the lord and if you cross your scriptures up look what you've goofed up you can't apply this coming to that coming to that coming each one of them must be applied individually in the right order all right he said first thessalonians is the order of this great rapture then he reads starting with the 13th verse and he goes down and using the word caught up technically he stops one verse shy but just to let you know i do know how to read but you know another man one time he talked about being caught up second corinthians 12. paul talking about such as one whether in the body or not i cannot tell since he's one caught up to the third heaven he said he couldn't tell whether he was in the body or out of the body but he was caught up into paradise and heard unspeakable words which is not lawful for a man to utter you know what paul never left the earth right he said whether in body where they want now you say well how do you know that well when brother branham was caught up beyond the curtain of time remember we do have a prophet he said he looked back and seen his body still laying on the bed he wasn't there in a body that way he was there in theophany with the rest of them because that's what he said that's where they were all right so i'm not arguing with paul whether it was in body or not because he said he didn't know well that'd be stupid for me to argue with him about it that's right when he said he didn't know we know one thing he was caught up and he saw things that was unspeakable heard words caught up revelations 12. verse 4 and 5. it talks about the stars of heaven falling etc i know what this scripture means now so listen it's speaking of jesus christ and him coming back there but he's speaking of god going to israel in the finish of it okay now and she brought forth a man child unto men child who was to rule all nations with a rod of iron and her child was caught up unto him unto god and unto his throne that's what i said that means when jesus raised was taken up that means when the jews come over here was in revelation 12. but they used the word caught up the same as paul used the word caught up the same as brother branham said the word rapture is not there it's the word caught up revelations 4 1 after this i looked and behold a door open in heaven and the first voice which i heard was were of a trumpet talking with me we said come up hither and i'll show you things that must be here after caught up we talk about john being caught up at the top of the rapture he was caught up did he leave the earth physically or but he definitely was caught up the two witnesses in revelations 11 and verse 12 they heard a great voice from heaven saying unto them come up hither and they'll send it up to heaven in the cloud there any of you beheld them the word caught up was even a physical thing to them but it's the word caught up matthew 11 28 jesus used the word caught up i mean he says come unto me all you that labor and are heavy laden and i'll give you rest caught up just remember the order that we read that the lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout voice of an archangel a trumpet and remember the prophet said that jesus does all three in his descending because remember to take us dire he has to be here not in a corporal physical body standing brother brown said he'd be so visible among us that he would raise the dead and we'd go in the rapture right all right but remember the dead's got to raise first is that the bible the dead and christ will rise first and we would survive and remain shall be caught up now we're supposed to believe the prophet's message where he explains in the rapture message that the shout was the message going forth right you know what was his message right the whole message right yes we look for a shout as a great big holler you know somebody hey i told you about how dumb i was somebody told me one time that you'd be able to tell when the lord was coming because he's coming in the cloud and you looked in the cloud and you seen a rainbow i'm excuse me seen her umbrella you know i was told that when i was a kid well you know i remember that you know every time a cloud had to come up i'd go outside and look i got it made because ain't no umbrella you said are you dumb yeah stupid and so are you what did you think the lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout hey now where would that be according to the bible that he calls it a secret coming as a thief in the night all right so the shout is the message that the prophet brought right right in case you ain't caught on i'm talking about something that is taking place and not something to look forward to it taking place are you following me maybe that'll click you to understand what i'm saying because i know the way i talk and things you get in them eyes go and they turn this away and you wonder what in the world are guys talking about because i'm not emotional to keep you going sister gale said or to walk down through the house now that does wake everybody up cause you don't know what i'm gonna step in the head you don't know what i'm going to do so i better wake up right come on but the lord himself shall descend from heaven jesus does all three of them so he descends from the heaven and what is the voice of the archangel he said the same loud voice that raised lazarus right yep the same loud voice that raised lazarus the dead would be raised by that voice and that voice is the message and a trumpet he says i believe it's the 10 virgins i'm 99 sure it's on there he's talking about this trumpet and he said a gospel trumpet or something we're looking for deducted after that gray's gonna open airplanes gonna be falling pilots are gone so the best thing to do when you get on an airplane is ask the pilot if he's a christian he says yes get off the plane you sound silly is it okay but are you listening to what i'm talking about we've had 40 something years to talk about a shout out a voice or an archangel in a trumpet but all that basically we hear is a quotation that the prophet says jesus does all three of these in his descending well are we looking for the descending of the lord when we've always caught we we've been taught all over a lot we're going to be caught up right when the prophet was talking about a descending or a condescending before they can be an easter ascending up there's got to be a condescending down a gospel trumpet or something don't you worry about it when the dead starts peering among us there's going to be a gospel trumpet it's not going to be well there's a dead one there's a dead one i think things are going on just a dead they'll get straitjacket right because that's what people are going to do all right the church have we heard his voice calling us up now i know i shouldn't be truthful and sarcastic but most preaching is beating you down instead and what few that does try to raise you up is they try to raise you up to say if you don't come be with us or believe our way you're gonna miss it but look what the prophet goes on to say because remember now jesus when he said coming to me all year labor and heavy laden he was calling us up to go to what he was speaking of we must be caught up i've got a lot more to say on this reason i'm just making a point because you see i thought we believe the bible it says that we're resurrected sitting in heavenly places in christ jesus i thought we believed that but see jesus was calling mankind up as we were talking about last night was jesus only speaking to the one standing there he did we don't know hope but can we take that scripture and realize that it's talking to you and i yeah come up if we don't have a new birth if we're not caught away in the new birth if we don't have a new birth then there's no rapture for us that is the word rapture caught up look what he said on the the seventh seal go ahead with number nine he's speaking from the seventh seal paragraph one and he gets down and he says and i pray heavenly father that that'll repeat again tonight that we could hear the voice of our lord calling us and calling us into to service for him closer wall we feel that we've heard his voice already in the opening of these seals speaking that it's the last day and the time is at hand grant these blessings that we ask we talked about the message being the shout out well then we should have at least heard the shout out heard it for 45 50 years going on now you know what a tape wise that we've had but where's the thing that to bring it to pass it is a certain brother that comes forth with a certain doctrine of certain ideas and and then why does everybody go to run an eye for them right see everybody's looking for something great to happen but are you looking for it being the word being revealed or an ecstasy of some physical emotions but how we heard his voice in the opening of the seals of course a big portion of the people of the message don't believe we need to hear anything about the seals right that's some deep things oh brother dale he gets out in them deep thing he he preaches seals he preaches daniel 70 weeks that's in deep things we don't want to get out there we might get all messed up folks don't worry about getting messed up we was born messed up don't worry about getting confused come on your prophet was the one that said it i didn't he said he cured a baptist bible and converted them to a baptist faith do you need that quote come on but what is the message done for us minus intellectual giants that can argue quotes like i told them last night see if you're talking to a baptist about one god he's gonna talk to you on the scriptures right he's gonna argue the scripture or some philosophy of so-and-so or some uh billy graham says we can't understand the trinity he might give you something like that but the people of this message most of them don't even quote you the scriptures or they don't know them and second off they got a quote kind of like a church of christ man said you quote your scripture said i got a scripture to shoot you down with is this a shooting down match if it's a quoting match we'll get us a jehovah witness go to the reading room what is it where's christ amen that's right that's it man he's certainly not in you because you're hateful and arrogant but the condo priest is nice glory go to the condo priest but church do you understand did the prophet use the psalmist as we read why did he just have to talk about a rapture and that's what he said when i tried to make my point to emphasize i'm gonna have to quit because we'll get to seed and take off again but in the psalms it was always something present tense to bring god on the scene to the psalmist david amen brother branham was the man that this message was alive in that's what caught me when i was a good old baptist i read the word i studied the word i didn't play around i argued with my brother he's a strict trinitarian and i didn't know how to explain it but i argued with him we'd set up at funerals how many older ones remember that you know you still you'd set up the dead all night long we'd be up all night long talking about the bible me and my brother he's a very intellectual person 12 years college and finally i told him one day when i seen it wasn't going any further i said from now on you quote a scripture i quote a scripture we ain't going to argue philosophies we're going to read the bible we never had another discussion it's honest why because he knew he couldn't handle the word he had been taught his philosophy but he said he couldn't stand the word when i quote him what the bible said jesus said unless you believe that i am he you will die in your sins now go ahead be like an old mule and hulk honk all you want to but do you understand what i'm getting at remember you can't be caught up until he's until a resurrection transpires come on the shout is the message the voice of the archangels the dead raising right then a trumpet the prophet said well curious he said like the gospel trumpet he said you know the trumpet when it sounds he said they found a trumpet back there and israel gathered have you ever looked up the word trumpet well i don't need to look it up i know what it is it's a bright horn you never looked up these words go look up trumpet and see if it don't go back to jubilee and remember now you'll find that jubilee is not jubilee in the bible it's jupiter j-u-b-i-l-e we call it j-u-v-i-l-e-e jubilee it's j-u-b-i-l-e so don't go looking for jubal i mean jubilee as we try to spell it with the two two e's on the end you don't find it in the scriptures once you go back and study the bible they sounded a gospel trumpet when the freedom came the time that it was to be a jubilee that same word jubilee back there comes exactly to the same word shout over in the new testament but you see we're wanting it to do this or that or the other we want to hear something and then somebody come along you know now i'm i'm trying to be funny but i'm trying to give an illustration you know somebody come along the preacher said have you heard the story said they saying in the papers now all over the internet that they some kind of trumpet sounding we need to get one of them machines to pick it up of course the guy that started the store he's the one selling the machine what can't you just see the people oh they got voices going on now they've been going on all alone your prophet is one that said it he said they could take a machine he said the words jesus was speaking and still going around the world what about it church paul caught up in the paradise the same word is caught up john caught up in revelation the same word as coda jesus said come unto me the same word is caught up have we heard his voice through the opening of the word come on now let me just say it for a second and then we'll come back to this this evening what are you trying to say brother dale okay i've taught you for 45 years one time the rapture is a process that is going on and if you don't have the new birth it's not even started for you the new birth is the most important thing in the world because only by the new birth can we hear the voice of god the day he was born again we'll get back to us this evening because some of you won't be here so i'll give it a little bit this morning make you interested at least when you got the new birth that's why that we don't believe the old denominational doctrine that we're going to get a new body you know another body word new is very deceiving we see most people preach we're going to get another body it's not this body we're going to get us another body and after all that brother branham said about it of throwing something down and picking the same thing back up the preachers in this message are still preaching we're going to get a new body after all he said we don't that even jesus would be there with nail prints in his hands that he raised with him now prince but we're going to get a new one you know why they don't believe that the blood of jesus christ is sufficient to redeem this one where are you gonna get it from mars jupiter you can't get it from here because this is garbage right but you see what if we got there one day and found out you remember the man that went to brother random and you remember he read a track and on that track it says where will you spend eternity some now if i miss the wording you just put it in it all right pretty close but the man read it he got concerned he started going everywhere he goes down to one place and they tell him you got to speak in tongues goes to another place you got to do this goes to another you got to do that you know he finally winds up with brother branham and he said i've went and done all that they've told me said what's wrong with random spoke to the man and he said you got it today you believed it he said you mean i've had it all alone and he says yes but that management torment trying to find what he already had what if it is that this message that we have received from a prophet of god is the very message that rapture and faith will lay in the books and the tapes that we read what if that's true then what are we looking for somebody to come and straighten it out straighten out what if you can straighten bread around them out you have to be almighty god not even another prophet wouldn't do no good to send it it would have to be god himself it would come if brother around him needed to be straightened out of course they didn't say that while he was alive but oh now what is that thing you can type in get all the people that's off the message believe the sign go home type it in your computer and find out how many preachers is now turned against the prophet to try to show how wrong he is they didn't do it when he was alive they had enough sense to not do it then what if we find out one day that the things we've been doing all these years of studying the message has been putting the word into the field for god to be able to quicken that's right and that from that jesus christ descends to the revealing of his word until he stands here in his people and calls the dead out of the ground come on and then we go up after the dead then we're caught up right the bible says will it be changed what are you saying brother dale i'm saying for 45 years i've tried to get you to see as a church that jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever and that he is alive living in you and i come on musicians and we've seen the results of the dead being raised the sick being healed the word being spoken but you know nobody on the internet wants to call and see about who who was raised in the dead you know why they don't believe it well i'm glad they don't i don't have to answer the phone go gonna don't talk on the internet i don't do none of these text messages put my phone number's on the church website don't you call me tell me where i'm wrong because it'd be an honor to find out who's wrong because i can do something about it and get right i can change my ways you see that's all i've ever tried to get you to see jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever but nobody wants to hear the truth nobody's ever called me wanting to know how that i preached in 1974 and still got the tapes that we could pass the year 2026 and not break brother branham's message nobody wants to know they'd rather hear somebody make a prediction that don't come to fights make another prediction they don't come to fight make another one that don't come to vice see they don't want to hear the truth this message is the shout out and only after the message comes forth can you talk about the voice of the archangel and then you can talk about the trumpet but yet because i don't have the wonderful sweet delivery of the condo priest people label me as an intellectual what i'd like to know what i've said today as intellectual i've simply read the bible i simply said what the prophet said and i certainly haven't given you my concept of anything i've given you what the prophet had to say you see we're always waiting until tomorrow or depending on what was yesterday instead of believing something present tense and that prophet one day let's stand when he made a statement that was outstanding you remember this one he said i'm not looking for the coming of the lord he said i'm saying he's here that's what he said but yeah we're still looking for his coming he says he's here what about it and that prophet began to talk about a god that was real i listened listen god this is what we need we need this message i still believe it don't you go ahead what do we got 94 94 and 74 in the sparring but anybody have a need y'all are open we'll take up this scene in the rest of the message you have heard of little moses you want to be more concentrated to the lord and to pray for our family what else would we want that's a desire and an honest heart you know what he'll give you the very desire that you ask for we don't have to pray you've already said it there's no need to pray it will be glorious is we are god and he's the same now and he will be the same over there but we're not over lord i hope you hear me tomorrow dance me you
