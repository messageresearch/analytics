[20:46] show God that we can worship because
[20:49] God's in worship word comes first but we
[20:52] do and the reason I'm doing this is is
[20:55] because most churches do this if you're
[20:57] a Community Church because like Pine
[21:00] Grove I mean they'll go over there 5
[21:01] minutes all of them live 5 minutes from
[21:03] church well they'll all go over there
[21:05] one Sunday Saturday afternoon but see
[21:07] some of you live there's not a one of
[21:08] you lives within 5 minutes of here I
[21:10] don't think I think we're probably the
[21:11] closest ones at at 8 to 10 8 to 10 miles
[21:15] right most of y'all live at other places
[21:17] like like you know 30 minutes 45 minutes
[21:20] hour and something away and you can't
[21:22] just call everybody and say hey get up
[21:23] here Saturday and and we're going to
[21:25] practice just a small length of time
[21:27] then you got to go back back home then
[21:28] come back on Sunday morning so what
[21:30] we'll do is on Sunday afternoon we will
[21:33] just do that once every other month the
[21:36] month that brother John's not doing it
[21:37] we'll have another Sunday
[21:40] afternoon of
[21:42] worship and play bring your instruments
[21:44] play if any if you have a new instrument
[21:46] anybody got something to to uh to add to
[21:49] it please let us know we'll try to make
[21:51] space for you everybody understand that
[21:53] so next Sunday afternoon after the
[21:55] second after the first service all
[21:57] musicians and all song leaders that are
[21:59] here meet with brother Joe Canada cuz
[22:01] he's going to head it all up and then
[22:03] March the 10th will be our first time of
[22:07] of having a time of worship and learning
[22:10] new songs and learning the keys and
[22:13] learning the new if you want to learn
[22:14] something new I may bring my bass guitar
[22:16] you never know but we'll see y'all don't
[22:18] all fall our life at the same time so

[24:21] a trumpet saying I am Alpha and Omega
[24:23] the first and the last what thou seest
[24:25] right in the book now he told John
[24:28] take this and write it in a book and
[24:30] send it to these churches John didn't
[24:32] John didn't keep it he wrote it and sent
[24:34] it to them all right because it tells it
[24:37] says to the church in Ephesus it tells
[24:39] them what to you know what to do and
[24:40] what you've the salutation and the and
[24:43] the rebuke what thou seest right in the
[24:45] book and send it into the seven churches
[24:46] which are in Asia which is Ephesus smrna
[24:49] pergamus tharus Sardis Philadelphia and
[24:51] L us here now remember none of these
[24:54] none of these are in
[24:56] Israel right these are not Jewish cities
[24:59] these
[25:00] are Gentile cities so it was a gentile
[25:03] bride that God come after so he put
[25:06] those cities over there in Asia and made
[25:08] them a
[25:10] gentile um made made Gentile cities out
[25:13] of them and I turned to see the voice
[25:14] that spake to me and behold turning I
[25:16] saw seven golden candlesticks and in the
[25:18] midst of the seven golden candlesticks
[25:19] went lik un to the son of man clothed
[25:22] with a garment down to the foot and G
[25:24] about the PS with a golden girdle you
[25:26] may be seated Lord add his now who was
[25:28] that that was the son of man but what
[25:30] form was he in he was taking now he had
[25:33] had he had had his
[25:35] form so many days 50 50 days before
[25:38] Pentecost he had had a form of Flesh he
[25:41] was in a glorified body he was walking
[25:43] around on the earth he could still eat
[25:45] fish and and all that and and he had
[25:47] substance he he was in a glorified
[25:49] condition but he hung around for a
[25:51] certain length of time and then he said
[25:52] I must go away in other words so that I
[25:54] can come back but what does he come back
[25:56] he doesn't come back back as himself in
[25:58] flesh he comes back in your flesh and my
[26:01] flesh Paul's flesh Peter all the
[26:04] different ones that's the flesh that he
[26:05] wanted to inhabit to do what to get the
[26:08] gospel and forward it to the people all
[26:12] right so he stands in the midst or the
[26:15] middle of all this he's right Among Us

[26:19] and he's got the uh Messengers and the
[26:21] Stars he I mean he knows what he's

[26:55] you say brother way that's final it is a
[26:57] final final revelation of Jesus Christ
[26:59] to the Gentile bride there is no other
[27:01] Revelation there is no another church
[27:03] age there is no other denomination there
[27:06] is no other anything that's going to
[27:08] come to a gentile Church except the
[27:10] bride amen and when he
[27:12] leaves through us he leaves where are we
[27:16] a wedding supper and he goes and
[27:18] presents himself to the Jews no other
[27:20] Gentiles is going to be saved not one
[27:22] all right so we're at the end we're at
[27:24] the part right now to where we're at the
[27:26] finality of at all there is no other
[27:28] Church age there is no other
[27:31] day we're
[27:33] it that's why it's important as Bob said
[27:35] this morning it's important to be
[27:37] fervent about what we're doing
[27:39] especially now toward we're getting
[27:41] toward the end John 1:14 says the word
[27:43] was made flesh and dwelt among us we've
[27:45] been reading that forever well he wants
[27:47] to be in your flesh because this new
[27:50] dispensation was it was animal flesh
[27:52] that was sacrificed and it didn't do
[27:54] away with your sin now now Christ has
[27:57] come by a New and Living Way Christ came
[28:00] gave his own life so that he could come
[28:03] back inside the believer and make you
[28:06] him in another form called a bride
[28:09] everybody with me all right by a New and
[28:11] Living Way which he has consecrated for
[28:13] us through the veil that is to say his
[28:16] flesh uh Sister Christine we were
[28:18] talking last Sunday we talking about the
[28:20] veil being rent do you know that Veil is
[28:22] was 4 Ines
[28:25] thick the veil that covered that Mercy
[28:28] Seat was 4 in
[28:31] thick and it was some I don't know
[28:33] astronomical 20 something feet high but
[28:36] it was rent from top to bottom that way
[28:38] they knew no man had went in there and
[28:39] ripped it from the bottom to the top it
[28:41] had to be God that rent it from the top
[28:43] and he just pulled it apart why because
[28:45] his brother B said if he would have
[28:46] turned and looked out the window of the
[28:48] temple they'd have seen the mercy seat
[28:50] sitting hanging on the cross all right
[28:52] so he moved from that a new testament or
[28:55] a New Covenant was which was in in his
[28:58] blood how much more shall the blood of
[29:00] Christ who through the eternal spirit
[29:01] offered himself without spot Purge your
[29:04] conscience from dead words to serve the
[29:05] Living God God's whole intent and
[29:07] purpose is is to live in you and make
[29:11] you
[29:13] holy make you holy make you him make you
[29:17] able to defeat the
[29:21] Devil listen to me without him standing
[29:24] right here with
[29:26] us well that'd be easy you got God
[29:30] standing beside of you in a glorified
[29:31] body he couldn't even save you he could
[29:36] not he's got to be inside of you so the
[29:38] only way he could do that was was go
[29:41] away leave the body there as a as a
[29:44] sacrifice that that as an advocate that
[29:47] God can see that and see the blood and
[29:49] sends the spirit back down here so that
[29:51] he can go out into each one of us and
[29:53] live through each one of us that's
[29:54] pretty simple but it's very profound how
[29:56] God did that
[29:58] and and you know what he's perfect I
[30:00] didn't know if y'all knew that or not I
[30:01] wanted to start it off with the message
[30:02] God's perfect he don't make no mistakes
[30:05] whatever he does every move he makes he
[30:06] never has to say oh sorry didn't mean to
[30:08] do that no so everything he set up is
[30:11] exactly the way that's why he thought so
[30:14] much of that Alpha bride to set set
[30:16] everything up in that first church age
[30:19] everything the mode of worship Paul
[30:21] comes in and tells us what deacons are
[30:23] what Elders are what pastors are what
[30:25] this is he sets it up in the first day
[30:27] age then we then it gets so convoluted
[30:30] down through and I'll when we get back
[30:31] to the nickan part of it somebody ask a
[30:33] question and I'll explain a little more
[30:35] about that but what happens is the power
[30:37] got took away from the people in this
[30:39] middle part of the
[30:41] ages all right so now what brother Bram
[30:44] comes he comes here and he tells the
[30:45] people he said hey it's not one it's not
[30:48] a hierarchy here I was just reading just
[30:50] a few minutes ago in the Hebrew series
[30:53] brother Bri said if you as a church vote
[30:57] to preach Jehovah Witness Doctrine he
[31:00] said we must either preach it or vote us
[31:03] out you not a deacon not a bishop not
[31:07] even the pastor your vote so see you put
[31:10] it all back into the Ley where the Ley
[31:13] has a power of a vote and you know what
[31:15] brother R said he said now if it's 51 to
[31:19] 50 he said that 51 wins he said what are
[31:22] you that lost going to do about
[31:25] it he said if you got the holy ghost
[31:27] Hebrew series 1957 I believe it is he
[31:30] says you that
[31:32] lost get with the ones that
[31:34] won and let's get out of here in other
[31:37] words be no well my 50 I I voted against
[31:40] and I I just well you need to
[31:44] leave brother BR they asked him one time
[31:47] said said we got a de you got a deacon
[31:48] in your church that doesn't believe like
[31:49] you believe he said he ought to get rid
[31:51] he said we ought to get rid of
[31:55] him givis them in the body don't
[31:58] work for this cuse he is a mediator of
[32:01] the New Testament that by means of death
[32:03] for the Redemption of transgressions
[32:04] that were under the first testament they
[32:06] which are called might receive the
[32:08] promise of Eternal inheritance not one
[32:10] of them got the inheritance of the
[32:12] promise of eternal life in the in the
[32:14] Old Testament not
[32:15] one not here anyway we got a promise of
[32:18] Eternal inheritance right here where
[32:20] you're sitting
[32:22] today for where a testament is there
[32:25] must be necessary the testator's got to
[32:28] die in other words he's got to die to
[32:30] give the force to this his will all
[32:33] right everybody with me I'm going to
[32:35] keep I'm going to fly through some of
[32:37] this cuz we we know that the body that
[32:39] was a body was prepared over there and
[32:41] then that body come that body left and
[32:43] now he's in the body of Believers he's
[32:46] his his Corporal body is not here it
[32:48] won't be here until the Millennium all
[32:50] right we come back with him everybody
[32:52] all right with that we know that so
[32:53] where is his body now he has a bride
[32:56] body and everybody's got got a part to
[32:57] play that's why you got to take it out
[32:59] and quit Conquering the leoty you got to
[33:01] have the leoty have the power and then
[33:05] God can flow through everybody then not
[33:07] just a set of hierarchy cuz that's what
[33:09] happened in the first part of the church
[33:10] ages they said oh the people don't need
[33:12] to understand this we've got it in Latin
[33:14] we'll just just just believe on this guy
[33:18] uh let this guy well you know sister
[33:19] Anna you can't understand a word they
[33:21] say when you go to church at a Catholic
[33:23] church but you depend on who the guy
[33:26] read
[33:28] it and you don't understand nothing see
[33:31] that's took a power away from the Ley
[33:33] that's Conquering the Le so they go oh
[33:36] well okay no the power is in the people
[33:41] the power is in the the power is in the
[33:44] church amen so let's continue
[33:49] on I want to try to get to something so
[33:51] I want to try to get this get through
[33:53] some of this now we know and understand
[33:56] that each age has his messenger and it's
[33:58] message so God is a
[34:00] dispensationalist God does have
[34:02] dispensations all right everybody with
[34:04] me we are not in the Lutheran
[34:06] dispensation if we were then it'd be
[34:09] wrong
[34:10] timing cuz we're in the end this is time
[34:14] over here that we're in the end we're
[34:16] not in the Luther age Luther won't even
[34:18] get you in the body now not Luther the
[34:19] person the Lutheran Doctrine everybody
[34:22] with me cuz you see this is the way I I
[34:26] uh approach everything is the Holy Ghost
[34:28] is the same in every age we know that
[34:30] but there's degrees that man has either
[34:34] put their hand over or hierarchies try
[34:36] to keep it away from people but if
[34:38] Luther was to come in today and not just
[34:40] sit here because of me sit here and
[34:42] listen to message Believers preach amen
[34:45] he'd be like wow that ain't nothing but
[34:47] the truth man I I didn't know I'm sorry
[34:49] baptize me
[34:52] again amen baptize me in the name of
[34:54] Jesus Christ I didn't see that oh
[34:56] Hallelujah and you yeah he'd be one
[34:58] that'd be you'd have to sit him
[35:00] down cuz he looked through a glass
[35:03] Darkly he could see certain things but
[35:04] there certain things he couldn't see
[35:06] same way with Wesley Wesley's like you
[35:08] mean y'all wear dresses all the time you
[35:11] don't cut your hair Oh Glory you don't
[35:14] wear
[35:16] makeup that's
[35:19] right that'd be
[35:21] him because the Holy Ghost Inside of him
[35:24] it would Quicken the word that he held
[35:26] plus Quicken the word now that he held
[35:28] that's why me and you have to have fresh
[35:30] Mana every
[35:33] service because your Holy Spirit feeds
[35:35] on that just like we feed that's like we
[35:38] fed down there a few minutes ago your
[35:41] body needs food so the church body needs
[35:44] food to sustain itself if not if you
[35:48] conquer the Ley then it makes it cold
[35:51] formal and Powerless that's what brother
[35:52] brandom said all right cold formal and
[35:55] Powerless and that's what we've seen in
[35:57] a lot of
[35:58] places but so the message and the
[36:00] messenger are one they come at a certain
[36:02] point of time and then what God does is
[36:05] when he's finished with that messenger
[36:07] he takes him home right it's not for me
[36:10] and you to go well why did he take
[36:11] brother Brown he did every one more time
[36:14] God
[36:15] Perfect all right if he's got his hand
[36:18] in it God's
[36:21] perfect it's not ever going to be a
[36:23] mistake so we must just lay it in his
[36:25] hands yeah I know there's a lot of
[36:28] people see a lot of people put and I'll
[36:31] explain this a little bit later but a
[36:32] lot of people's Holy Ghost was brother
[36:37] brandom and when God took him off the
[36:39] scene their Holy Ghost left with them
[36:41] left with him and then they scattered
[36:43] off into this church and that church and
[36:44] this place and that place if you put you
[36:46] if you put your confidence in a
[36:49] man you see that a lot of times you know
[36:52] you see U um um not here but you see
[36:55] preachers that the pastor dies or goes
[36:57] off somewhere in adultery or something
[36:59] and and the people
[37:02] just well he was he's everything he was
[37:05] all I put my I hope you never put your
[37:08] Hope on
[37:09] me or anybody that preaches in this
[37:11] church you put your hope in Jesus Christ
[37:14] and if I tell you what Jesus said you
[37:16] put your hope in that and you'll not
[37:18] fail but you put it on a man you will
[37:21] fail cuz the Bible says right here if
[37:23] you don't do the right thing I'm going
[37:25] to pull your C listen God can do that he
[37:28] said I'm going to pull your Candlestick
[37:29] out you know when you pull a Candlestick
[37:31] out what happens it pulls it away from
[37:34] the oil that's down inside and what
[37:36] happens your fire goes
[37:39] out all
[37:41] right amen plain but not it wasn't as
[37:45] plain as
[37:47] Bob there was a lot of Band-Aids given
[37:50] out
[37:53] today big
[37:55] ones drag across the floor I started to
[37:58] say when I come in this morning I
[38:00] thought now everybody reach down pick
[38:02] your head up put back on your
[38:05] shoulders or brother Claude wisinger he
[38:07] called me one time he said man he said I
[38:09] just know I just know that y'all y'all's
[38:12] head separated from me I said what he
[38:14] said I was watching your dad last Sunday
[38:16] and he he cut down on something he said
[38:19] I know y'all's head had to hit the floor
[38:20] and roll he he said cuz mine
[38:24] did but you do it with Loving Hands
[38:28] brother Dell always did it with Loving
[38:30] Hands All right so look what happened a
[38:32] seal is open what's that a mystery is
[38:34] unfolded cuz each age had a
[38:37] mystery Luther had a mystery the mystery
[38:40] was as just shall live by faith the rest
[38:41] of the world said no put it on the
[38:42] Catholic Church let let let let the pope
[38:45] go do that for me let the priest go do
[38:47] that for me all
[38:48] right but the mystery of that was is
[38:51] that just shall live by faith come out
[38:54] of that thing come out of her my people
[38:57] same way with me and you the same way
[38:59] when you saw this message a mystery
[39:01] unfolded that you had not previously
[39:04] seen in the other part of your life or
[39:06] at a church somewhere else denomination
[39:08] or or something like that you saw
[39:10] something You' never seen before that's
[39:13] a mystery all right and why because of
[39:16] the message that you were taught you
[39:20] receive Revelation and a mystery from
[39:23] what's taught you don't get you don't
[39:26] get a Revelation from any from a a tree
[39:29] or or a piece of wood you get it from
[39:31] somebody preaching the message to you
[39:32] and then something Sparks inside the
[39:34] Holy Ghost says that ain't nothing but
[39:35] the truth let's go study that for a
[39:37] minute to me that's where you see a
[39:39] mystery unfold see a mystery is unfolded
[39:42] when it unfolds a trumpet sound so the
[39:44] mystery is going to unfold listen the
[39:46] prophet's going to get it
[39:47] first Paul irus I ain't talking about
[39:49] brother R he's part of it but I'm
[39:51] talking about all they get the message
[39:52] first they get it fresh from God and
[39:54] then they turn and they deliver it to
[39:56] the people well listen God's got so much
[39:59] confidence that when he tells that
[40:00] person he knows that person is going to
[40:01] turn around and tell the truth
[40:04] right cuz I God's perfect did I ever
[40:07] tell you all
[40:09] that he picked those Messengers brother
[40:11] Bown didn't pick them he picked them
[40:13] brother random just by Revelation got
[40:16] them out and Sh saw the characteristics
[40:18] of each one and told us it was Paul
[40:19] irenius Martin Columba Luther Wesley and
[40:22] and Elijah all right but God picked them
[40:24] way before brother brandom did cuz
[40:26] remember he had those seven stars in his
[40:28] hand way back when now a church AE op so
[40:32] a trumpet sounds it declares a war uh
[40:34] look at Luther oh wow he went against
[40:37] the whole
[40:38] world remember what he said he said they
[40:40] said
[40:41] Luther said the world is against you he
[40:43] said let it be known I'm against the
[40:46] world the teaching of the Catholic
[40:48] church was all over it was like a cancer
[40:51] and here he stood out and said no the
[40:53] just shall live by
[40:55] faith and that was a war
[40:58] started and the angel of the church
[41:00] catches the mystery of God not fully yet
[41:02] revealed in other words brother Brown
[41:04] didn't get all when he started
[41:06] progressive revelation but when he does
[41:08] he catches the mystery of God then he
[41:10] goes forth to the people after the
[41:12] mystery has been given to him Goes Forth
[41:14] to the people what does he do out there
[41:15] he begins to proclaim a message what
[41:17] does it start it starts a spiritual war
[41:20] and when God takes his messenger with
[41:22] the elect of that age and lays them away
[41:24] asleep now we're going to get into
[41:25] something a little bit about lap over
[41:28] cuz remember God doesn't now he does
[41:30] take his messenger at a certain time but
[41:32] remember that message trickles on a
[41:33] little bit
[41:35] further CU you can't just stop brother
[41:37] random you couldn't take every tape
[41:39] right now and throw them away there's
[41:40] always going to be something somewhere
[41:42] out there some some MP3 something's
[41:45] going to be out there you can't just
[41:48] abruptly stop and say well brother R
[41:50] don't listen to him no more so that's
[41:52] the same way with Paul Paul had a
[41:53] message and he died he died in the in 86
[41:56] 60 something well the age started in the
[41:57] ' 50s and went to 170 so it had to be
[42:01] the people catching the Revelation which
[42:03] God knew they would and taking that
[42:05] Revelation and preaching it all but
[42:07] remember there was a time where brother
[42:08] brandham he even says he says one time
[42:11] he says he said you need to tell them
[42:13] and said you're not preaching what Paul
[42:17] preached is it time for us to say you're
[42:20] not preaching what brother Randon
[42:23] preached sure it is
[42:27] all the different doctrines we got the
[42:29] church but he puts them to sleep drops a
[42:32] plague upon them who reject it a
[42:35] temporary judgment then after that's
[42:36] over he goes on look they denominate
[42:40] bring in denominations and start off
[42:42] with that man's work like Wesley and all
[42:43] the rest of them gets all scrapple again
[42:46] then another mystery comes
[42:49] forth when did Israel get a
[42:54] deliverer when did
[42:57] Israel get
[43:00] Moses brother Bram said when when God
[43:03] heard the Cry of the
[43:06] people God sent them
[43:09] Moses so we've got to cry out each age
[43:11] cry out and says oh we need that but we
[43:15] need something fresh yes amen you and I
[43:18] have come to this part to where we need
[43:19] to know what we're knowing now not plus
[43:22] not somebody else not we go past the
[43:24] prophet no we got start understanding
[43:27] what he's already
[43:28] said praise the Lord I agree with that
[43:31] then another mystery comes forth what
[43:33] happens another messenger arrives on the
[43:35] earth for a church age in other words
[43:36] starts back up again in other words he
[43:38] shouts a trumpet he declares a war then
[43:41] what happens finally he's caught away
[43:43] when he's laid away the plague Falls
[43:45] spiritual death hits the church in other
[43:47] words what they all denominate and she's
[43:49] gone that group then he goes on to
[43:51] another now let's read this I am Alpha
[43:54] and Omega the beginning and the end so
[43:55] we were talking about the the book ends
[43:56] this
[43:58] morning excuse me the alpha church is
[44:00] Ephesus the Omega Church is leosa it's
[44:04] the beginning and ending of the Gentile
[44:05] bride dispensation all
[44:08] right and what God had at the first he's
[44:11] going to have the same thing at the end
[44:13] all right everybody with me on that so
[44:14] the pattern is we're going to see the
[44:16] pattern and we saw it some this morning
[44:18] you're going to see the pattern it holds
[44:20] through all the way till the end all
[44:22] right he was
[44:25] all all the letters but specifically he
[44:28] was Alpha and Omega he had a rainbow
[44:30] over his head which was the Covenant now
[44:32] look the line of Pentecost where it
[44:34] started gradually smothered out these
[44:38] men irenius polyart and all the rest of
[44:39] them sealed their testimony with their
[44:41] blood until it finally squeeze
[44:42] Christianity into the darkest of days
[44:45] which was the Dark Ages all
[44:47] right but everything started I want to
[44:50] get back over
[44:52] here all right let's just right here
[44:54] because I didn't read it this morning
[44:56] I did this but let me continue on with
[44:58] this
[44:59] masterpiece bless you every one of these
[45:02] churches coming down through here he
[45:03] revealed himself in deity only in his
[45:05] glorified form is everybody with me on
[45:06] that you this morning Paul had a
[45:09] complete clear understanding of one God
[45:12] Paul Peter had a complete understanding
[45:14] John had a complete understanding of one
[45:16] true and living God all right now it got
[45:18] as brother Brown said scrapp down
[45:20] Through the Ages well what had to come
[45:22] out on this side was the Supreme deity
[45:25] back again
[45:27] that Jesus was God not a second person
[45:29] not a third person but he was God
[45:31] Almighty but during the church ages they
[45:34] knew he was deity
[45:37] listen but they had him as a second
[45:39] person amen because of what not God
[45:42] because of man's
[45:44] ideas all right they had conquered so
[45:47] much to where they said oh just whatever
[45:50] the Pope says you know you take somebody
[45:51] I going to ask you a question I know
[45:53] sister Anna was a Catholic is anybody
[45:55] else a Catholic in here before brother
[45:57] uh
[45:58] Louise you take some of the things that
[46:01] they force on the
[46:04] people it's
[46:07] ludicrous it's down right funny it's not
[46:10] but it is that Mary took a Rapture I
[46:13] mean Mary you know Mary she's not buried
[46:15] she had she resurrected and she went up
[46:17] and she's the mother of
[46:19] God and then this one over here Patron
[46:21] saying of something other something
[46:23] happened and if you'll pray to that guy
[46:24] he'll get you across River or something
[46:26] you know you understand what I
[46:28] mean it sounds silly to us but hey I
[46:31] mean who in the world's going to pray
[46:32] and go 12 beads Pray Again 12 beads pray
[46:36] again oh it broke I need to go buy
[46:39] another one so go to the Catholic Church
[46:40] buy you another
[46:42] one you see how funny that sounds but
[46:45] it's it's not that was that was so much
[46:47] formed in those people's mind till they
[46:50] believed it and they'll kill you for
[46:52] it they'll kill you for it why can't we
[46:55] be fervent about the
[46:57] truth that
[46:59] way all right if they can do that and
[47:02] pray to this saint and pray to that
[47:04] Saint
[47:05] and
[47:06] anyway they have a place listen they got
[47:10] a place they're the old mother
[47:12] so that's what the Bible says so now
[47:15] look in the Masterpiece I didn't put
[47:16] this in I put this in this this
[47:18] afternoon it'll never be it at the
[47:20] Harvest Time look the seed is back to
[47:23] its original condition so where's the
[47:26] planting planted on day of Pentecost
[47:29] First Church age where's the Harvest at
[47:32] over here in the end time in other words
[47:34] it goes back the seed that is back to
[47:36] its original condition and must have all
[47:39] the word in order to be the
[47:42] seed now you can't have half a seed it
[47:45] won't grow am amen all right I believe
[47:48] in speaking in tongues that's just part
[47:50] of the seed uhhuh but now there is there
[47:52] is added to that Hallelujah the life not
[47:55] the gift gifts the life of the gifts see
[47:59] what I mean we're at the end time
[48:01] brother stock tassel husk is dead and
[48:04] dry now in other words if you planted a
[48:07] stock of corn before it's really robust
[48:10] and green and you put a lot of Nitra on
[48:12] it man you squeeze it and the water just
[48:13] runs out of it and it makes this big old
[48:15] ear of corn and and that ear of corn is
[48:18] when it's ripe to eat when we eat it
[48:20] it's just so
[48:22] juicy but the Stock's dead as a hammer
[48:25] the there's no life there anymore it
[48:27] dries
[48:28] up then all the everything else start
[48:30] drying up what happens is bless you
[48:33] there's a there's something going on
[48:35] here but that seed's got to be what that
[48:38] seed's got to put in the sun to ripen
[48:41] dry out and then you can plant that seed
[48:43] and start just like the original
[48:45] everybody with me all right so stop tal
[48:48] husk is dead and dry now that's why we
[48:51] can't go back to 1906
[48:53] Pentecost we go to the Pentecostal
[48:56] blessing but you can't go
[48:58] backwards how in the world these people
[49:00] that leave the message go
[49:02] backwards they never had the
[49:07] forward there's only one thing that has
[49:09] to happen to that that's to be gathered
[49:10] in the world Council of churches for its
[49:12] burning the word has become flesh
[49:14] exactly like it promised in Luke 17
[49:16] Malachi 4 and all that's right see
[49:18] Revelations all true life that was in
[49:20] the stock tassel and hus now listen when
[49:22] that when that thing was growing and it
[49:24] was a stock it had life
[49:26] yeah right it was real it was the part
[49:29] of the Corn but God moved out of that
[49:32] life to put all the strength that's why
[49:35] you prune something everybody with me
[49:38] that's why you prune around the suckers
[49:40] cuz what happens is that life's coming
[49:42] up through the root and if it has to go
[49:44] out here to a sucker which is just
[49:45] something that's there a a limb wasted
[49:50] energy cut that thing off everybody with
[49:54] me are you thinking spiritual now or we
[49:55] an apple tree and an apple
[49:57] orchard anyway so the life comes up and
[50:00] then it's got a shoot that runs out this
[50:02] way cut the thing off prune it because
[50:05] what happens is is that that plant's
[50:08] whole entire existence is to reproduce
[50:11] itself
[50:13] again the whole thing is for them to
[50:15] reproduce theirself again and to
[50:17] reproduce yourself again you got to go
[50:19] back to seed and for us to reproduce we
[50:21] got to go back to
[50:22] seed all right everybody with me on
[50:26] true life that was in the stock tassel
[50:27] and husk is now gathering in the seed
[50:31] that's where you that's why you really
[50:33] put the nitrogen to that corn when it
[50:34] starts making that ear because you know
[50:37] you want all that energy to make a big
[50:40] full ear
[50:42] corn because that plant's existence is
[50:46] is to get in and make that corn seed
[50:48] everybody with me same thing with the
[50:50] word of God like I said this morning
[50:52] God's going to have a bride he's going
[50:54] to have an enti bride is going to take a
[50:55] body change I don't care we can sit we
[50:57] can sit and say no no no the sun ain't
[50:59] coming up no no no the sun ain't coming
[51:01] up if you'll open your eyes about 6:30
[51:02] in the morning you'll see the sun come
[51:04] up all
[51:06] right ready for the resurrection ready
[51:08] for the Harvest the alpha has become
[51:12] Omega amen the first come last and the
[51:15] last is the first the seed that went in
[51:19] has come through a process and become
[51:21] seed again the seed that fell in the
[51:24] garden of Eden and died there come back
[51:28] wow he went way back didn't
[51:30] he from from that imperfect seed that
[51:34] died there come back to the perfect seed
[51:37] the second Adam all right first EP fell
[51:39] we know that but look the Alpha and
[51:41] Omega is the same we become the
[51:44] same all right the first Ministry and
[51:46] the last Ministry is the same the first
[51:48] message and the last message of the same
[51:50] that's why I read you that quote the
[51:51] other day where brother Bram stood down
[51:53] across a curtain of time and he said did
[51:55] Paul make
[51:56] it the angel said yeah Paul made it he
[51:58] said I bless God I know I will he said I
[52:01] preach the same thing he preached and
[52:03] all them millions of people said we are
[52:05] resting on that right
[52:07] there there'll be a day that we won't be
[52:09] called day or night but in the evening
[52:11] time it shall be light see Alpha and
[52:12] Omega it's become the first and the last
[52:15] the Masterpiece we talked about the
[52:17] vision where brother Brown said the
[52:19] church came into to view once the bride
[52:21] comes into view twice all right
[52:23] everybody understand that if you don't
[52:24] remember
[52:25] Vision go back and read it all
[52:29] right that's the reason she was in View
[52:31] the second time she was reviewed the
[52:33] first time then the second time and she
[52:35] was perfectly the same the second time
[52:37] like she was the first time let skip
[52:40] through so we won't be Sate but the
[52:42] bride came back cuz she was Alpha and
[52:44] Omega God the great sculptor has made
[52:46] him a masterpiece for it's a piece of
[52:49] his first masterpiece like he made in
[52:51] the Garden of Eden and took a piece from
[52:53] and made another piece that was Martin
[52:55] fell now he's been all this time
[52:57] building up it up again and he brought
[53:00] forth this masterpiece and was smitten
[53:02] in order that part that was smitten was
[53:04] in order to bring back again he's saying
[53:07] that I'm saying this this masterpiece is
[53:10] what the prophet of God came to
[53:16] get so the Masterpiece and the Son of
[53:18] God the Masterpiece in the bride and
[53:20] it's a piece of him which must be the
[53:23] fulfilling of the word because we're
[53:25] going to look in another church age that
[53:27] even means the unfulfilled age they were
[53:29] all
[53:31] unfulfilled and until you accept the
[53:33] message of the hour and get all the
[53:35] doctrines correct and get our lives
[53:36] straight like the first church age we'll
[53:38] be the same
[53:40] way everybody with me they didn't
[53:43] believe in three gods in the beginning
[53:44] of the
[53:45] church you can't find that sort of
[53:47] belief amongst the apostles it was after
[53:49] the apostolic age that this
[53:52] Theory not a Doctrine Theory came came
[53:55] in and really became an issue in a
[53:56] cardinal Doctrine at the Nan Council the
[54:00] doctrine of the godhead caused a two-way
[54:02] split at NAIA everybody we've been
[54:04] through that all we know what happened
[54:06] the true bride went to NAA to try to
[54:08] turn it around and they left with their
[54:10] head
[54:12] down cuz this over here was so much
[54:14] stronger but God had to allow that to
[54:17] happen cuz remember the seed had to go
[54:20] in the
[54:21] ground right to come back through Luther
[54:24] and come back through Wesley
[54:25] into today Revelations 2 unto the angel
[54:28] of the Church of left of Ephesus right
[54:30] these things sayith he that holdeth the
[54:31] Seven Stars in his right hand who
[54:33] walketh in the midst of the seven golden
[54:36] candlesticks I Know Thy works and thy
[54:38] labor and thy patience and how thou cast
[54:39] not bear them which are
[54:41] evil and thou Hast tried them which say
[54:43] they're Apostles and are not and have
[54:46] found them Liars what' he do give them
[54:47] the word test and hath borne and hasth
[54:50] patience and for my name's sake H hath
[54:51] labored and hasth not fainted
[54:53] nevertheless I have somewhat against
[54:54] thee because thou has left thy First
[54:57] Love remember therefore from whence Thou
[54:59] Art fallen and repent and do the first
[55:01] works or else I will come unto thee
[55:03] quickly and remove your Candlestick out
[55:06] of its place except thou repent here's
[55:09] what we got to this morning but this
[55:10] thou Hast that thou hatest the Deeds of
[55:13] the nicians which I also hate you say
[55:16] God hates yeah God hates God's got
[55:18] emotion if y'all didn't know that or
[55:20] not he's the very seed of
[55:24] emotion Satan just twists his emotion
[55:27] and makes it something else right
[55:29] everybody with me S remember Satan is
[55:31] not a Creator he can't create one
[55:34] thing not one thing he is not the
[55:37] originator of
[55:38] nothing except
[55:43] chaos so whatever he gets he copies from
[55:45] God and makes it that close so that you
[55:48] can't tell the difference
[55:49] hardly so we looked at the word Deeds
[55:52] means an act or something done
[55:55] cuz in the first church age it just
[55:57] became as like a saying or or what's
[55:59] your opinion about uh um you know I
[56:03] can't be God he cried uh he can't be God
[56:06] he he got tired he slept in a boat he
[56:09] can't be God well well he close enough
[56:11] to God though let's make him let's make
[56:12] him something a little different but the
[56:16] same a that the way where do all
[56:20] doctrines come
[56:21] from talking to somebody else and then
[56:24] bringing in
[56:26] here amen
[56:29] yeah so nanism or nickan means Nico
[56:33] which is Victory or conquer which the
[56:35] word Nike comes from letin which is the
[56:38] members or the
[56:41] leoty and somebody asked what somebody
[56:43] said well how can you conquer a whole
[56:45] church you can conquer a whole church by
[56:47] being so forceful and so uh adamant
[56:50] about I'm the man you just got to do
[56:52] what I got to you just do what I tell
[56:54] you
[56:55] amen that to me that to me that just
[56:57] beats everybody down and we you know we
[56:59] I've seen it before it don't
[57:03] work but when you put everything in
[57:04] place like it's supposed to be did I
[57:07] ever preach that God didn't make a
[57:09] mistake okay so he didn't if he set his
[57:13] church up first right he said Alpha
[57:17] church is going to be right then he said
[57:19] Omega Church is going to be right all
[57:22] right they have been identical in two
[57:25] that held the doctrine of balam I
[57:26] remember what I told you balam was a
[57:27] hireling
[57:28] prophet they seem to have held that it
[57:31] was lawful to eat things sacrificed to
[57:32] Idol now look take that and put it in
[57:35] the message or a message or someone's
[57:37] message
[57:41] well you know come to church as you are
[57:45] we want everybody to come to
[57:48] church right we
[57:50] do and I agree with the statement Come
[57:52] As You
[57:53] Are
[57:56] but don't leave as you
[57:58] were or you just wasted your
[58:01] time that's right right come as you are
[58:04] that's fine but what it is says oh well
[58:06] that's okay you can stay here don't
[58:07] worry about it well I would lose people
[58:11] if I preach that remember what brother R
[58:12] told Brother Ram said I'd rather eat
[58:14] soda crackers for those of you that
[58:16] don't know what that is that's little
[58:18] bitty crackers about that big and they
[58:20] used to call them soda crackers now
[58:21] they're what are they saltines salting
[58:25] crackers same I'd rather drink Branch
[58:27] water and eat that and preach on the
[58:29] side of a street corner than to
[58:31] compromise on the gospel and I agree
[58:34] because if you don't you become a
[58:35] hirling and then you're just a hirling
[58:37] prophet and you just do what somebody
[58:38] else
[58:39] says they may have been identical in
[58:42] those who held the doctrine of balum
[58:44] they seem to have held it to where it
[58:46] was lawful to eat things sacrificed to
[58:48] Idols to commit fornication in
[58:50] opposition to the decree of the church
[58:53] rendered in Acts 15 so in other words
[58:55] they wanted to be a
[58:58] church listen Satan does not want to be
[59:00] in
[59:02] church right he wants to be here and he
[59:05] is but he wants to just change it one
[59:08] little
[59:09] way and that's all he needs to do to get
[59:11] you at all of
[59:14] us so it's the opposition to the decree
[59:16] of the church because remember when a
[59:18] when a when a a message Goes Forth what
[59:20] does it cause why does it cause a
[59:23] war because there's a opposing forces
[59:26] there's only two forces Satan and God
[59:28] that's the only two there is there's
[59:30] nobody well I just believe I well no you
[59:32] might be the devil okay only two sides
[59:35] devil side God's side there's no in
[59:37] between all right pick a
[59:40] side choose you this day Who You Shall
[59:45] Serve if it be God come over here if it
[59:48] be uh Janice or whoever the other was um
[59:52] who was it cor Corin Dayan choose
[59:56] them God stood there one day and said
[59:58] I've had enough right I've had
[1:00:02] enough and Moses said he said if you're
[1:00:04] for me stand right here if you're for
[1:00:06] daythan and cor go over there and God
[1:00:08] said I'm fixing to show you which side
[1:00:10] was right he opened the ground up
[1:00:13] literally opened the ground up and
[1:00:15] swallowed several hundred people and
[1:00:18] closed their back shut what a mess that
[1:00:20] was but that's
[1:00:22] God separating
[1:00:25] the good from the
[1:00:27] bad cuz he hates nickol latinism he said
[1:00:30] he did he hates all this he hates
[1:00:32] somebody coming into church and trying
[1:00:33] to change
[1:00:34] everything all right when it's supposed
[1:00:36] to be set up the way it's supposed to be
[1:00:37] set up all
[1:00:39] right so to hate these Deeds is a sign
[1:00:42] of life in a church that otherwise is
[1:00:43] weak and faithless to tolerate them is
[1:00:46] well n to Forfeit the glory of having
[1:00:48] been faithful under persecution so let's
[1:00:51] continue on the alpha church is born
[1:00:52] where was the alpha Church born it was
[1:00:55] born on the day of Pentecost all right
[1:00:57] but now the first church age didn't
[1:00:58] start on the day of
[1:01:02] Pentecost there was a Pentecostal
[1:01:04] age right let let me let me show you
[1:01:08] something right here real quick if I can
[1:01:09] get to it you have your um you got your
[1:01:12] chart
[1:01:16] there let's see brother Anderson if we
[1:01:23] can
[1:01:25] I'm have
[1:01:28] to can you still see that a little bit
[1:01:31] come
[1:01:33] on how about now you in the
[1:01:37] back no oh hang on a
[1:01:43] minute
[1:01:45] oh blow it up a little how about that
[1:01:49] can you see
[1:01:51] that kind of
[1:01:53] shorter that's the church age thing that
[1:01:55] I gave you a little while
[1:01:57] ago uh when brother Dale preached on the
[1:02:00] eight manifestations of God and then I
[1:02:02] preached on the porter this has been
[1:02:03] back lord 20 years ago
[1:02:05] almost now if if brother K know he knows
[1:02:11] exactly when he listen to them old tapes
[1:02:14] so if you got your Alpha bride right
[1:02:16] here right you got your Omega bride
[1:02:19] right here right their book ends they've
[1:02:21] got to
[1:02:23] be starting the same way are they
[1:02:27] different so in ad30 we'll get to it in
[1:02:31] a minute but I just want to show you
[1:02:32] this now in ad30 there was a Pentecostal
[1:02:35] age that Paul was not involved
[1:02:39] in
[1:02:41] amen
[1:02:43] ad30 when Jesus died resurrected 50 days
[1:02:47] later on
[1:02:49] Pentecost the Holy Ghost fell and an age
[1:02:51] began but it was the age of Pentecost no
[1:02:55] messenger Peter was the spokesperson not
[1:02:58] the messenger got it then there was an
[1:03:02] age began in ad 53 who was Paul who
[1:03:06] comes at the end of the Pentecostal age
[1:03:08] that's going to be real clear and for
[1:03:12] when we get to right here
[1:03:15] now I looked all over this church and
[1:03:17] asked all y'all I couldn't find no white
[1:03:19] out so anybody know what white out
[1:03:21] is and the kids are going what's that
[1:03:24] just masty race uh but right here right
[1:03:28] here should be Pentecost again because
[1:03:31] between that age and this age there was
[1:03:32] an age of Pentecost 1906 isza Street
[1:03:36] brother brandham was not a part of that
[1:03:39] wasn't even
[1:03:40] born it's 1906 he was born in 1909 he
[1:03:43] wasn't even born during this time that
[1:03:45] started but there was a Pentecostal age
[1:03:48] right here it was run by the Holy Ghost
[1:03:51] just like what fell at this Pentecost
[1:03:54] the the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost came
[1:03:56] himself on the day of Pentecost to birth
[1:03:58] and start the church not the church age
[1:04:01] start the bride all right same way with
[1:04:04] here that's going to happen here we'll
[1:04:05] see it later on there was a Pentecostal
[1:04:07] age no messenger brother Brown said the
[1:04:10] Holy Ghost came himself to bring this
[1:04:12] message and then what happened then
[1:04:14] brother BR just stepped out from
[1:04:16] that just like Paul Paul stepped out
[1:04:20] from that Pentecostal age cuz remember
[1:04:23] when Paul stepped out of that age it was
[1:04:26] a little bit different than brother
[1:04:27] Brown because when brother Brown stepped
[1:04:28] out of that Pentecostal age they were
[1:04:30] still
[1:04:31] trinitarians cuz they were at the end
[1:04:33] they needed to be turned back but now
[1:04:35] the first one when Paul stepped out
[1:04:36] remember when Paul came on the scene
[1:04:39] Peter and them had already receed the
[1:04:41] Holy Ghost like 20 years before he came
[1:04:42] on the scene or 15 years right but
[1:04:47] here's Paul that was killing the
[1:04:49] Christians not literally but causing
[1:04:51] them to blaspheme and and die every by
[1:04:54] with me he takes the scrolls with the
[1:04:56] Holy Ghost goes into Arabia or into
[1:04:59] Egypt or wherever he went and sat down
[1:05:01] and God revealed all that to him cuz he
[1:05:04] was a church age Messenger right then he
[1:05:08] comes out and he steps into that first
[1:05:10] church age and him and Peter's preaching
[1:05:13] the same
[1:05:16] thing he didn't even know Peter and he
[1:05:18] comes up to Peter and says oh we're
[1:05:19] preaching the same thing but then you
[1:05:21] got to remember when Paul gets the real
[1:05:23] revelation of that
[1:05:25] age Peter says he says things hard to
[1:05:30] understand in other words he's got a
[1:05:32] little more depth than I do okay is
[1:05:34] everybody with me so you see that happen
[1:05:36] on both ends Pentecostal age began Paul
[1:05:40] stepped out of that Pentecostal age and
[1:05:41] started a group of Ephesus brother
[1:05:44] random stepped out of the Pentecostal
[1:05:45] age of 1906a Street and then it was
[1:05:49] 1947 when he started preaching what we
[1:05:52] know is the message of the hour
[1:05:54] right a little while later but you'll
[1:05:57] also
[1:05:59] see that that brother
[1:06:02] Paul he said in the Bible he says I was
[1:06:04] one born out of due season in other
[1:06:06] words I should have been born in that
[1:06:08] Pentecostal age but I wasn't there was a
[1:06:10] there was a there was an opportunity for
[1:06:13] Paul Peter and them to bring the message
[1:06:16] and then Paul just steps right in well
[1:06:17] same way with brother brandom in 1950 if
[1:06:19] you'll watch that movie that they have
[1:06:21] of him preaching in Washington DC what
[1:06:23] did you tell the Pentecostal to people
[1:06:25] he said I was one born out of due
[1:06:27] time he said I should in other words I
[1:06:29] should have been born 1906 of Z Street
[1:06:32] no not
[1:06:33] born born again during that time all
[1:06:36] right cuz listen Peter was alive when
[1:06:39] the day on the day of Pentecost he was
[1:06:42] here he was just persecuting the ones
[1:06:44] that received the Holy Ghost not
[1:06:46] preaching the Holy Ghost all right so do
[1:06:48] you see that cuz we've got overlaps in
[1:06:51] between and we'll get into all that and
[1:06:53] we'll see how the the messenger comes at
[1:06:54] the end of the age and we'll see the
[1:06:56] manifestations of God but just see one
[1:06:59] thing for sure there was a Pentecostal
[1:07:00] age began here then Paul stepped out the
[1:07:03] messenger that was a Pentecostal age
[1:07:05] here that brother R stepped out and was
[1:07:07] a messenger everybody with me all right
[1:07:10] the Holy Ghost had to come back in power
[1:07:12] restore the
[1:07:13] gifts but they were still trinitarian so
[1:07:15] there were some things that that that
[1:07:17] brother Bram had to preach to get him
[1:07:20] out of
[1:07:21] that all right everybody with me all
[1:07:23] right
[1:07:25] so the alpha church is born and we know
[1:07:28] how it was born it was born on the day
[1:07:29] of Pentecost I don't have to go through
[1:07:31] this
[1:07:34] anymore now watch what brother this is
[1:07:37] what I was going to talk about this
[1:07:38] morning about the Thrones this is Jesus
[1:07:41] talking I didn't just put that in red
[1:07:43] that's what Jesus is saying behold I
[1:07:45] send the promise of my father upon you
[1:07:48] now this is Jesus when he's getting
[1:07:50] ready to leave and he's getting ready to
[1:07:51] come back on the day of Pentecost he's
[1:07:53] going to U the alpha bride is going to
[1:07:56] be born and it's going to be born right
[1:07:58] all right behold I send the promise of
[1:08:01] my father upon you but tear you in the
[1:08:04] city of Jerusalem till you be endued
[1:08:06] with power from on high so what is the
[1:08:08] father what is that promise that they
[1:08:10] would receive the Holy Ghost right Shake
[1:08:15] Yourself they send the promise of the
[1:08:17] Holy Ghost I'm going to send you the
[1:08:18] comforter I'm going to send you what
[1:08:20] somebody to help you the advocate
[1:08:22] somebody to lead you and guide you into
[1:08:24] all truth which is the Holy Ghost now
[1:08:28] look now this is Brother Rand watch 1955
[1:08:31] Switzerland said now his body with nail
[1:08:34] scars in it has not come back yet it's
[1:08:37] sitting at the right hand of God he's
[1:08:40] sitting on the father's Throne
[1:08:44] now you with me but when he comes back
[1:08:47] he's going to sit on his own Throne the
[1:08:50] Throne of David that he inherited now
[1:08:52] that's in what the Millennium amen all
[1:08:56] right that's when he comes in physical
[1:09:01] form but he's here now in spiritual form
[1:09:06] working through your body and my body
[1:09:09] the father's
[1:09:11] Throne Revelation chapter 5 watch I want
[1:09:15] you to notice I'm looking right down the
[1:09:16] fifth chapter he says fear not fear not
[1:09:19] you don't want to get scared about
[1:09:20] anything one of the elders said unto me
[1:09:22] weep not he's in Revelations five Behold
[1:09:24] The Lion of the tribe of Judah the root
[1:09:26] of David has prevailed to open the book
[1:09:27] and loose the seals thereof and lo
[1:09:29] behold in the midst of the throne and
[1:09:31] four beasts in the midst of the Elder
[1:09:32] stood a lamb now watch what brother R
[1:09:34] says now what are those four combat
[1:09:35] beasts lonox man an eagle what is that a
[1:09:37] representation of that's the Holy Ghost
[1:09:40] everybody with me it's the Holy Ghost so
[1:09:42] he's talking about the Holy Ghost a lamb
[1:09:45] why didn't he see the lamb
[1:09:48] before the lamb had been seated on the
[1:09:51] father's Throne inside of the
[1:09:55] guards the four combat Beast or in other
[1:09:57] words the Holy
[1:09:59] Ghost John could not see in there he
[1:10:02] only seen those foreheaded or four Beast
[1:10:04] standing there or those four cherubs
[1:10:06] standing there guarding the holy place
[1:10:10] in the breach brother R said look where
[1:10:12] did it come from it come from the
[1:10:15] father's Throne where he had been seated
[1:10:17] since he had been slain and raised
[1:10:21] again he sat on the father's Throne sent
[1:10:23] the holy goes back this has been the
[1:10:24] father's Throne the whole through the
[1:10:26] whole church ages right but now remember
[1:10:28] Revelation 3:14 says we get to sit on
[1:10:31] his throne okay all right so we we'll
[1:10:34] cover that later on he raised up and sat
[1:10:36] on the right hand of God ever living to
[1:10:39] make intercession how does he make
[1:10:40] intercession by the Holy
[1:10:42] Ghost that's what intercedes for you it
[1:10:45] doesn't matter if I'm praying for
[1:10:46] brother for brother Louise it's the Holy
[1:10:49] Ghost
[1:10:50] interceding inside of me right right and
[1:10:53] that's why you ask prayer for this one
[1:10:54] and that one and you you want to have
[1:10:56] prayer you want the Holy Ghost to
[1:10:57] intercede for you okay so so the
[1:11:01] father's Throne Jesus said look the
[1:11:04] father's Throne is now the kingdom
[1:11:06] that's in power
[1:11:08] now cuz Steven when Steven was stoned he
[1:11:11] looks up and he sees
[1:11:13] what Jesus standing on the right hand of
[1:11:16] the father in other words on the
[1:11:19] throne right remember he says don't lay
[1:11:23] this charge to anybody because I'm going
[1:11:25] to read it in just a minute there was
[1:11:26] somebody standing there that had some
[1:11:29] significance when Steven got
[1:11:32] stoned so what step was making
[1:11:34] intercession because he said father
[1:11:36] don't lay this to nobody's
[1:11:38] charge and Paul was standing
[1:11:41] there Saul held the
[1:11:44] coats I was watching a movie one time of
[1:11:46] of of Paul and it was really what they
[1:11:49] done they throwed Steven out well they
[1:11:50] come running out of the they all had
[1:11:52] their robes on come running out of the
[1:11:53] Temple where they had condemned Steven
[1:11:55] Steven preached him a message he didn't
[1:11:57] leave nothing to be desired except that
[1:12:00] they were wrong they had killed Jesus so
[1:12:04] what happens is Paul stand or Saul is
[1:12:06] standing right here a young boy standing
[1:12:08] right here and as they run by him to get
[1:12:09] to where they can Stone him good you
[1:12:11] know you can't fight with a coat on so
[1:12:13] they take their cloak off and he's
[1:12:15] standing there like this and they're
[1:12:16] just laying their coats over him as
[1:12:18] they're running by to Stone Steven so he
[1:12:21] was there when the first martyr took
[1:12:24] place amen but he said father don't lay
[1:12:29] this to their charge and there stood
[1:12:34] Saul John 17 I prayed for you Jesus said
[1:12:39] I prayed for you I pray that you make it
[1:12:42] I pray that we be one I pray that you
[1:12:45] understand what I'm
[1:12:46] saying so when the day of Pentecost was
[1:12:49] fully come we know what happened a
[1:12:51] rushing Mighty Wind came and it filled
[1:12:54] the house where they were sitting as we
[1:12:55] were talking this
[1:12:56] morning and they all spake in tongues
[1:12:59] but when they went outside it was that
[1:13:02] everybody was hearing them in their own
[1:13:03] language what a what a revelation that
[1:13:06] was and there were dwelling in Jerusalem
[1:13:08] Jews devout men out of every nation
[1:13:10] under Heaven because Pentecost was a
[1:13:12] feast day and they all came from all
[1:13:14] over the country all over the world
[1:13:16] actually from all these other places so
[1:13:17] as we skip down through here Pentecost
[1:13:20] means 50 we know that so let's get
[1:13:22] through this real quick well it's
[1:13:27] hot oh here here's here's what he says
[1:13:30] watch th this is what Peter says this
[1:13:32] Jesus hath God raised up whereof we all
[1:13:35] are witnesses therefore being by the
[1:13:36] right hand of God exalted and having
[1:13:38] received of the Father the promise of
[1:13:40] the Holy Ghost so there's your there's
[1:13:41] your answer what is the Father's Throne
[1:13:43] it's the promise of the Holy Ghost he
[1:13:45] has shed forth this which you now see in
[1:13:47] here for David has not ascended into the
[1:13:49] heavens but he said the Lord said unto
[1:13:51] my Lord sit down on my right hand till I
[1:13:53] make thy foes thy foot stols you know
[1:13:55] how he's gonna do that he's gonna do
[1:13:56] that to me and
[1:13:57] you Heaven is my throne and
[1:14:02] Earth where we living
[1:14:04] today Earth is my foot stol amen I'm
[1:14:08] going to do it on
[1:14:10] Earth therefore let all the house of
[1:14:12] Israel know ass surely that God ha made
[1:14:14] that same Jesus whom you have crucified
[1:14:16] both Lord and Christ now when they heard
[1:14:18] this they were pricked in their heart
[1:14:19] and said Peter to Peter and the rest of
[1:14:21] the Apostles men and Brethren what shall
[1:14:23] we do and Peter said unto them repent
[1:14:26] and be baptized every one of you in the
[1:14:27] name of Jesus Christ for the remission
[1:14:28] of sin you shall receive what the
[1:14:30] father's Throne the gift of the Holy
[1:14:33] Ghost for the promises unto you and your
[1:14:35] children to all them that are far off
[1:14:36] listen he's sitting on a temporary
[1:14:41] place right let me get back to
[1:14:45] that cuz he wants to be sitting on his
[1:14:50] throne cuz that's where you and I are
[1:14:53] amen
[1:14:56] right everybody with me he sitting on
[1:14:59] the father's Throne making intercession
[1:15:01] for us down
[1:15:03] here but in Revelations 3:14 he said I
[1:15:06] want them to sit with me and my
[1:15:10] Throne as I have also overcome and sat
[1:15:13] on my daddy's Throne right so he's not
[1:15:16] on his the correct Throne he wants to be
[1:15:18] on cuz are we in heaven no the father's
[1:15:22] Throne now is right here
[1:15:24] he's making intercession he's not way
[1:15:26] over under somewhere he's right here but
[1:15:28] he wants to sit on his own throne and us
[1:15:30] be there with him that's his whole
[1:15:33] that's the whole part of him dying for
[1:15:36] what to get us to sit where he's
[1:15:39] at I like that for the promises to you
[1:15:43] and your children them the before off
[1:15:44] even as men as the Lord thy God shall
[1:15:45] call and then man 3,000 people were
[1:15:48] saved at one time what a water
[1:15:51] baptism now here's Peter real quick
[1:15:54] Peter on the day of Pentecost like I
[1:15:57] said before he wasn't the
[1:15:59] messenger he was a spokesman cuz the
[1:16:02] Holy Ghost spoke himself through the
[1:16:04] people there was no Messenger to that
[1:16:06] age all
[1:16:08] right Peter was a
[1:16:10] spokesperson before the day of Pentecost
[1:16:12] he was given the keys to the kingdom we
[1:16:14] find that he opened it to the Jews on
[1:16:17] the day of Pentecost and he went down to
[1:16:19] Samaria and opened it to them came back
[1:16:22] to the house of Cornelius and opened it
[1:16:24] there and he never had had to do it no
[1:16:27] more it was open to the world see like
[1:16:30] that the Holy Spirit but you remember
[1:16:32] Philip went down and preached the
[1:16:33] Samaritans and baptized them in the name
[1:16:35] of the Lord Jesus only the Holy Ghost
[1:16:36] had not fallen on any of them so what
[1:16:38] did he do he called for Peter Peter had
[1:16:41] a key so they sent up for him that had
[1:16:44] the keys and he laid his hands on them
[1:16:46] and the Holy Ghost Came Upon
[1:16:47] them then we we Gentiles we're just
[1:16:50] heathens Romans Greeks and so forth we
[1:16:52] worship idols we weren't looking for a
[1:16:54] messiah we had no time for a messiah we
[1:16:56] had our own Gods our forefathers but the
[1:16:58] Jews were looking for a messiah so was
[1:17:00] the Samaritans because they were half je
[1:17:01] and Gentile now watch now I said this
[1:17:03] morning Jesus will appear to those who
[1:17:05] are looking for
[1:17:06] him if you're not looking for
[1:17:08] him only those that's all he is not
[1:17:11] obligated to the unbeliever but to the
[1:17:14] believer brother Dell told us many many
[1:17:16] times he said God does not adopt the
[1:17:18] devil's kids he adopts his own children
[1:17:22] all right it's
[1:17:24] your choice whether to be his child or
[1:17:27] not but to the believer he is obligated
[1:17:30] he is obligated to raise the believer up
[1:17:32] in the last days only to the believer
[1:17:36] now this what happened in the book of
[1:17:37] Acts this is during that Pentecostal
[1:17:39] time before Paul steps on the scene now
[1:17:41] and we'll stop right there and we'll get
[1:17:43] to it when Paul steps on the scene and
[1:17:45] they continuing daily with one Accord in
[1:17:47] the temple they went to
[1:17:52] church
[1:17:54] breaking bread from house to house did
[1:17:56] eat their meat with gladness and single
[1:17:58] heartedness of s singleness of heart
[1:18:01] praising God and having favor with all
[1:18:03] the people and the Lord added to the
[1:18:05] church daily such as should be saved
[1:18:08] Acts 3 ver4 it says Peter fast his eyes
[1:18:10] upon him with John said look on us and
[1:18:13] he gave heed unto them expecting to
[1:18:14] receive something of them then Peter
[1:18:16] said Silver and Gold Have I None but
[1:18:18] such as I have give I Thee in the name
[1:18:21] of Jesus Christ of Nazareth rise up and
[1:18:23] walk and he took him by the right hand
[1:18:25] and lifted him up and immediately his
[1:18:27] feet and ankle bones received strength
[1:18:29] I'm talking about the characteristic
[1:18:31] that happened in the Pentecostal age all
[1:18:32] right everybody with me all right acts
[1:18:34] 7:57 I didn't bring this one but I read
[1:18:36] it yesterday where even even they
[1:18:39] thought so much of those disciples and
[1:18:41] they knew they had so much power they
[1:18:42] would walk down the street and the
[1:18:44] people would lay down in front of their
[1:18:46] Shadow and God would heal them
[1:18:49] wow they were called Christians in
[1:18:51] Antioch because of why
[1:18:53] they acted like
[1:18:55] Christ acts 7:57 then they cried out
[1:18:59] with a loud voice and stopped their ears
[1:19:00] and ran to him with one Accord now this
[1:19:02] is Steven and they cast him out of the
[1:19:04] city and stoned him and the witnesses
[1:19:06] laid down their cloth at a young man's
[1:19:09] feet whose name was Saul and they stoned
[1:19:13] Steven calling upon God and saying Lord
[1:19:15] Jesus receive my spirit and he kneeled
[1:19:18] down and cried with a loud voice
[1:19:20] Lord lay not this s to their
[1:19:25] charge and when he had done
[1:19:27] this he did as all real Believers he
[1:19:30] fell asleep amen he didn't die he fell
[1:19:35] asleep so let's review this just a
[1:19:37] little bit we we'll be done age of
[1:19:39] Pentecost started ad30 because that was
[1:19:41] when Jesus was crucified 50 days later
[1:19:44] which he was died in
[1:19:46] ad30 so the day of Pentecost or their
[1:19:49] day of Pentecost was close to that in
[1:19:52] ad30 the messenger to that part of the
[1:19:55] of the age of Pentecost was the Holy
[1:19:59] Ghost Peter was a spokesman but Peter
[1:20:02] was not the prophet to the age everybody
[1:20:05] with me all right Acts 2 verse1 and when
[1:20:08] the day of Pentecost was fully come they
[1:20:09] were one Accord in one place that came a
[1:20:12] sound from Heaven as a rushian mighty
[1:20:13] went they were all filled with the Holy
[1:20:15] Ghost they all were not just one person
[1:20:17] they all were filled with the Holy Ghost
[1:20:19] and began to speak with other tongues as
[1:20:20] the spirit gave them utterance watch
[1:20:23] Peter was the spokesperson and had the
[1:20:25] key to open the door to the Gentiles
[1:20:28] until Paul come on the
[1:20:32] scene and he had so much grace that he
[1:20:35] just stepped away and he said Paul says
[1:20:36] things really hard to be
[1:20:38] understood I don't I don't disagree with
[1:20:41] him but I just sometimes can't
[1:20:43] understand what he's saying all
[1:20:45] right and then this is the there it is I
[1:20:48] was looking for there it is right there
[1:20:50] same thing day of Pentecost there was a
[1:20:53] Pentecostal age and then the age of
[1:20:55] Ephesus began then the same thing over
[1:20:57] here in leosa we'll see that later
[1:21:00] on I want you to read this right if you
[1:21:02] can see this right here it says the
[1:21:03] messenger to the age this kind of sums
[1:21:05] up all that that I read you in the first
[1:21:07] seal so the messenger to the age does
[1:21:10] what condemns the world the messenger
[1:21:12] steps on the scene he immediately
[1:21:13] condemns the world cuz what's he doing
[1:21:16] there he's condemning the ones that
[1:21:17] turned away from back here all right
[1:21:20] then what is he doing he rebukes to
[1:21:22] previous age for getting away from
[1:21:25] Luther's message Wesley's message
[1:21:27] whatever you want to say and then he
[1:21:29] brings his message then as we said
[1:21:31] before there's a war begins a spiritual
[1:21:35] war here's what Paul Peter said and
[1:21:37] account that the long suffering of Our
[1:21:39] Lord is salvation even as our beloved
[1:21:41] brother Paul also according to the
[1:21:43] wisdom given unto him hath written unto
[1:21:45] you as also in all his Epistles hey
[1:21:50] Peter read Paul's writing
[1:21:55] in as also in all his Epistles speaking
[1:21:59] in them of these things in which are
[1:22:01] some things hard to be understood which
[1:22:03] they that are unlearned and unstable
[1:22:06] rest or wrestle as they do also with
[1:22:09] other scriptures unto their own
[1:22:12] destruction amen acts 13:46 then Paul
[1:22:15] and Barnabas W bold and said this is
[1:22:17] necessary that the word of God should
[1:22:19] first have been spoken to you but seeing
[1:22:21] you put it from you and judge yourself
[1:22:23] Unworthy of everlasting life low who's
[1:22:26] he talking to he's talking to the
[1:22:28] Jews cuz Paul's a Jew he can speak to
[1:22:31] the Jews cuz he's a Jewish all right but
[1:22:33] he says I've told you all this I've
[1:22:35] spoken to you I seeing you put it from
[1:22:37] you in other words seeing you ston me
[1:22:39] and Barnabas you put us in jail Hey
[1:22:42] listen who was the worst persecutor of
[1:22:44] Paul the
[1:22:47] Jews judge yourself Unworthy of
[1:22:49] everlasting life Lo we turn this is in
[1:22:52] Acts 13 this is where we're going to
[1:22:53] stop right here Lo we turn to the
[1:22:56] Gentiles for so ha the Lord commanded us
[1:22:59] saying I have set thee to be a light of
[1:23:00] the Gentiles that thou should us be for
[1:23:02] salvation unto the ends of the Earth and
[1:23:05] when the Gentiles heard
[1:23:08] this when the Gentiles heard this they
[1:23:12] were glad that God had turned a message
[1:23:16] that was supposed to be for the Jews he
[1:23:18] turned it over to a bunch of stinking
[1:23:21] Gentiles and he took a bride out of that
[1:23:24] he said that's a wife I want to live
[1:23:26] with praise
[1:23:29] God and when the Gentiles heard this
[1:23:31] they were glad look and glorified the
[1:23:33] word of the Lord and as many as it were
[1:23:35] ordained to eternal life
[1:23:38] believed Romans 11:25 for I would not
[1:23:41] Brethren that you should be ignorant of
[1:23:43] this mystery lest you should be wise in
[1:23:45] your own conceit that blindness in part
[1:23:47] has happened to Israel God literally
[1:23:49] blinded Israel's
[1:23:51] eyes
[1:23:53] right cuz he had to put them away amen
[1:23:56] cuz what did they do they went to Idols
[1:23:58] they went whing so he put them away and
[1:24:01] he blinded them blindness in part has
[1:24:03] happened to Israel until the fullness
[1:24:07] now watch until the fullness of the
[1:24:08] Gentiles be come in that didn't happen
[1:24:10] in the first church age right fullness
[1:24:13] happens in our
[1:24:15] age he was telling them there's going to
[1:24:17] be ages and ages but until the fullness
[1:24:19] of the Gentiles be come in I'm going to
[1:24:22] Blind Israel cuz remember when we leave
[1:24:24] out of here God's going to lift that
[1:24:25] blind
[1:24:27] off right God's going to lift that blind
[1:24:29] off and they're going to go we've been
[1:24:31] looking for a messiah and you two
[1:24:33] witnesses are telling us he's already
[1:24:35] come 2,000 years ago and he say
[1:24:39] yeah then they receive the holy ghost or
[1:24:41] they kill him one of the two am and so
[1:24:44] so is so all Israel shall be saved as it
[1:24:46] is written that shall come out of Zion
[1:24:48] the deliver and shall turn away
[1:24:50] ungodliness from Jacob for this is my my
[1:24:52] Covenant unto them now see he still got
[1:24:54] a covenant with Israel he'll never
[1:24:55] forget them and he he'll always have
[1:24:58] Israel there there's going to be 144,000
[1:25:00] there's going to be all kind of things
[1:25:02] set up that's still in the Jewish
[1:25:04] Kingdom as concerning the gospel now
[1:25:07] watch as concerning the gospel now this
[1:25:09] is what Paul's preaching the gospel as
[1:25:12] not the Ten
[1:25:14] Commandments to
[1:25:18] them everybody with me now watch what
[1:25:20] he's saying as concerning the the gospel
[1:25:22] in other words what I have preached to
[1:25:24] you you've turned it down you become my
[1:25:27] enemy they are enemies for your sake but
[1:25:31] as touching the election they are
[1:25:34] beloved for the father's sake in other
[1:25:36] words they're going to hear the elect is
[1:25:38] going to hear and they're going to
[1:25:39] accept it you're going to turn me down
[1:25:41] and make me an
[1:25:42] enemy as whoever said that uh today
[1:25:45] about of I become your enemy Paul Bob
[1:25:48] did if I become your enemy cuz I told
[1:25:50] you the truth people get way more mad at
[1:25:53] you for telling the truth than they will
[1:25:55] a good old fat juicy
[1:25:56] lie cuz you manipulate a good old fat
[1:25:59] juicy lie and make it sound good but the
[1:26:03] truth NOP it's just the truth for the
[1:26:06] gifts and calling of God are without
[1:26:09] repentance for as ye are in times past
[1:26:11] have not believed God yet have now
[1:26:14] obtained Mercy through their the Jews
[1:26:18] unbelief even so have these also now not
[1:26:21] believed that through your mercy they
[1:26:23] also May obtain Mercy what's Paul
[1:26:26] saying look they didn't believe over
[1:26:30] here we're the Believers now but since
[1:26:33] we're the Believers now we're going to
[1:26:35] take what we have the
[1:26:37] mercy that we have and give it to them
[1:26:41] amen this same message is going to the
[1:26:44] is going to the Jews same message to
[1:26:47] show Jesus Christ in a group of people
[1:26:49] not that the messiah's coming not that
[1:26:51] they need a temple not that they need a
[1:26:53] a red heer not that they need any of
[1:26:55] that he's already come and they didn't
[1:26:57] know it they say where did you get those
[1:27:00] scars believe in Jeremiah somewhere like
[1:27:02] that he says in the house of my friends
[1:27:04] what 2,000 years ago when they put him
[1:27:05] on the cross amen Israel was one that
[1:27:08] said let his blood be on us and our
[1:27:09] children not the Gentiles the Jews did
[1:27:12] right so now let's look at the alpha age
[1:27:14] just real quick let's musicians get
[1:27:16] ready to come on the Ephesian Church age
[1:27:18] then started a.
[1:27:20] 53 Paul founded the church at Ephesus
[1:27:23] about the middle of the first century
[1:27:24] this enables us to set the date of the
[1:27:27] beginning of the Ephesian Church age
[1:27:29] about ad 53 and you'll see we got it
[1:27:32] back up there but remember the age of
[1:27:35] Pentecost ad30 to ad 53 all right then a
[1:27:40] messenger comes on the scene until the
[1:27:42] angel of the Church of Ephesus write all
[1:27:44] these
[1:27:48] things now watch this real quick
[1:27:51] musicians come on
[1:27:52] the key given to me of the Lord whereby
[1:27:54] I was able to determine this is out of
[1:27:56] brother Brown talking determine the
[1:27:58] messenger for each age is most most
[1:28:00] scriptural one in fact it might be
[1:28:01] called the Keystone of the Bible it is
[1:28:04] the Revelation that God never changes
[1:28:06] have I not said that before God don't
[1:28:09] change it is the Revelation that God
[1:28:11] never changes and that his ways are as
[1:28:15] unchangeable as he is amen Jesus Christ
[1:28:18] the same yesterday day and forever in
[1:28:20] Ecclesiastes here it is an unchanging
[1:28:23] God with unchanging ways what he did at
[1:28:26] the first he will have to keep on doing
[1:28:30] until it is done for the last
[1:28:32] time there will never be a change apply
[1:28:36] that to the church ages the kind of man
[1:28:38] that God chose for the first age and how
[1:28:41] God manifested in that man's Ministry
[1:28:43] would be the example for all other ages
[1:28:47] what God did in the first church age is
[1:28:49] what he wants to do and all all other
[1:28:52] ages okay said he wanted to do it now we
[1:28:55] know exactly from the word which was
[1:28:57] recorded by the Holy Ghost Holy Spirit
[1:28:59] how the first or original church was
[1:29:01] founded we've been talking about that
[1:29:03] and how God manifested himself in her
[1:29:06] bride the word can't change or be
[1:29:09] changed because the word is
[1:29:10] God now look there's some bullet points
[1:29:13] real quick let's
[1:29:14] stand get done a little bit early thus
[1:29:18] what the church was at Pentecost is the
[1:29:21] standard
[1:29:22] that is the pattern there's no other
[1:29:24] pattern no matter what the scholars say
[1:29:26] God has not changed his pattern what God
[1:29:29] did at Pentecost he has to keep on doing
[1:29:30] until the church age closes like I said
[1:29:32] there was an age there there's an age
[1:29:34] here all right that original church was
[1:29:36] not organized by men it was led by the
[1:29:39] Holy Ghost it wasn't very big it was
[1:29:42] hated and despised it was oppressed it
[1:29:44] was persecuted unto death but it was
[1:29:46] true to God it stayed with the original
[1:29:49] word pattern now don't get LED astray
[1:29:52] here when I said that God and his ways
[1:29:54] never change I did not say that the
[1:29:56] church and its Messengers could not
[1:29:59] change ah there's where it
[1:30:04] happens the church isn't God so she can
[1:30:08] change but what I said was that because
[1:30:10] of the unchanging God with unchanging
[1:30:13] ways we can go back to the beginning and
[1:30:15] see the first and perfect ACT of God and
[1:30:18] then judge by that standard that is how
[1:30:21] it's done the true church will always
[1:30:24] try to look like the original at
[1:30:26] Pentecost the true church of today will
[1:30:29] try to approximate that every that every
[1:30:32] first one and the messenger to the
[1:30:34] churches having the same spirit of God
[1:30:37] in them will try to approximate the
[1:30:39] Apostle Paul they won't be exactly like
[1:30:42] him but the true Messengers will be the
[1:30:44] ones that come the closest to Paul who
[1:30:46] was free of all men sold out to God Gave
[1:30:49] forth the word of God only and
[1:30:51] manifested Ed the Holy Ghost in power
[1:30:53] none else would do you have to work from
[1:30:56] the original as light begets like the
[1:30:59] true church will always be the one that
[1:31:01] tries to follow in the steps of her
[1:31:04] Founders at Pentecost and her Messenger
[1:31:06] will follow the Apostle Paul the first
[1:31:08] Messenger to the first church age it is
[1:31:11] that simple and that wonderful and who
[1:31:14] was a messenger it was Paul we'll talk
[1:31:16] about that the next time we we preach
[1:31:18] but um whatever that is read the book of
[1:31:22] Acts whatever happens in the book of
[1:31:24] Acts has got to happen
[1:31:27] today that was your first church age
[1:31:30] started in the book of Acts didn't start
[1:31:31] in Matthew Mark Luke and John started in
[1:31:33] the book of Acts that's when the New
[1:31:35] Testament started after Jesus died then
[1:31:37] you look all the way over here and you
[1:31:39] can't change your pattern that's why
[1:31:41] brother R couldn't say well now now now
[1:31:43] Paul now he's just a woman
[1:31:45] hater no he said Paul was right in what
[1:31:47] he
[1:31:49] said yes that's what I put my confidence
[1:31:53] in if Paul wrote 80% of the New
[1:31:56] Testament right he he wrote 80% of the
[1:31:58] New Testament right his
[1:32:00] writings ought to be a pretty good guy
[1:32:02] to follow and if brother brandham
[1:32:05] mirrored it and preached the same thing
[1:32:07] plus brought us to the seals I ought to
[1:32:09] be able to I ought to be able to go with
[1:32:12] this guy okay I ought to be able my the
[1:32:14] Holy Ghost and me ought to agree with
[1:32:15] the Holy Ghost of that person right
[1:32:17] there right pretty simple let's sing a
