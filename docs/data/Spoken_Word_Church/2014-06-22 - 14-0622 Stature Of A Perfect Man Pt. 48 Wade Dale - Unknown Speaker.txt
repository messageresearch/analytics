========================================

brotherly kindness okay brotherly kindness this one's going to be tough all right come on come on come on there you go good boy all right brotherly kindness let's read now second peter one follow along simon peter our servant apostle of jesus christ to them that have obtained light precious faith with us through the righteousness of god and our savior jesus christ grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of god and jesus our lord according as his divine power has given unto us all things that pertain to the life and godliness what we're talking about excuse me through the knowledge of him they have called us for lord virtue whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these you might be protectors of the divine nature i mean escape the corruption those in the world do lust and besides this give me all diligence that's not gonna be something that god's gonna just give to you these are victories they are character victories right it's a character victory besides just giving all diligence and to your faith virtues your virtual knowledge knowledge temperance temper patience patience goblin is godless brother kindness and brother kindness charity where things be in you and abound they make you that you should not be barren or unfruitful in the knowledge of our lord jesus christ so all these things together is going to make us a very fruitful person because the next scripture says that if you like these things you're blind right see we'll we'll read that maybe next time if you like these things you're blind you can't see it far off it's not that you're not born again it's just that you're blinded to the other virtues or you're blinded to a certain part of the word and you will not be fruitful you will be barren in other words you want to produce anything somebody's barren can't produce all right so it's very important here we are up to brotherly kindness brother brown didn't speak a whole lot on brotherly kindness but he preached the whole his whole 1100 sermons was on brotherly kindness right and he was trying to get natural brothers pentecostals baptist methodists come together now what we're trying to do is we're trying to get the message people together you know and not just see it our way right that's not the that's not the uh there's a watch this right here then sixthly they said the bible said adding brotherly love brotherly kindness now that's a good one right here the sixth one seven seven right up there brotherly kindness all right adding brotherly kindness all right we got it when we get to that brotherly kindness put yourself in his place on the matter put yourself in his place on the mayor where'd you come from that's what i'm saying hey bro good to have you with us good to have you with us good to see you good to see you where was i scaring me today now you say my brother sinned against me said peter shall i forgive him he said seven times a day he said seventy times seven how much is that 490. how long did israel 400 490. so there you are god's going to forgive israel in the 490 years 70 times seven brotherly kindness now you see if a brother is all out of tune don't be impatient with it hello anybody home i think don't be impatient with it remember we were supposed to get patience before that okay because see to me like i told you all before this is number 48 of of this this statue of a perfect man it's all sure it all winds up into charity but this thing all winds up and the key is brotherly kindness because right there at the pyramid there's brotherly kindness right before the holy spirit seals everything into you and brings the capstone down because remember you can have faith which is a rock you can have virtue which is a rock temperance which is a raw patience are godliness revelation right but when you come to brotherly kindness if you've got paper you understand the analogy that headstone is a rock if you got rock rock rock rock and then you think well i can pass by a little brother kindness i'll just i'll just make it a little paper i just you know i'll just pretend like i love my brother you know you know pretend like ben's a good guy and not me but that's what he said no but but brotherly kindness has got to be a rock also all right that headstone is not going to come on anything but the rock if you started with a rock in the foundation which is faith then brotherly kindness cannot be what any other material so brotherly kindness is just as important and to me it's the key to bring you right up into that statue of a perfect man into the headstone which is love which is not love at all it's a gopher level brother kindness now see if her brother is all out of tomb don't be impatient with him be kind to him go anyhow somebody said not long ago how can you believe these things the way you do and still go to the assemblies of god one that's all the rest then put seed brother to kindness cc hoping someday see patience with him see temperate enduring with him knowledge to understand you watch what he's doing to me brotherly kindness is all these other virtues wrapped up into one right yeah it's all these perches wrapped up into one number one you've got to have faith brother claude was talking the other day and he's preaching on the statue of perfect man that he's doing it also because people are seeing the importance in the statue of a perfect man i think the ones that's going to make it to the headstone you're just not going to be standing somewhere and the heads don't follow you right they're going to rock following you one day but it'll be one of them 90 pound talents that they talk about in the book of revelation that's right that's not a headstone that's a literal phone that's right that's what somebody asked me one time said well you're you're you can't um talk about this dress and all this stuff and some of the old testament said what are you going to do so they used to stone people when when they did things wrong in the old testament i said don't worry go over there in revelations and read with them 90 pound stones win 90 pound hailstones are going to pound this earth and pound the people they're going to get their stone in it's just they're going to get it over there you know and not like they did in the old testament but it is a type of it's the same thing it's the ending up of all things that stoning in the old testament was the type of this world being stoned in the new testament all right it's like brother uh bob was bringing out really good the other night and i never thought about that smart as i land thought about that so it was good about i'll be fishers of men and then the fish the fish being the trout you know and all the ground will come like a third pool that's what jesus was telling the people right he said i'm coming to fish these people out i'm coming you know i'm coming back but i'm not i'm not gonna do it myself i'm gonna do it through here so brother brown's standing there fishing what's he doing he's fishing for trout which is what if these fishers are men then that trout is me and you that's what he's catching he's catching the people bringing them in first pull got their attention second pull brought him in a little bit closer bigger fists and then the third pull was the was the big great big one all right so a wonderful type there and it was it was really good having faith that someday having faith having faith so he dropped right back down like brother and i were talking about you got to have faith for every one of these you never leave that foundation of faith you got to have faith that god gives you virtue you got to have faith that god gives you knowledge tim you gotta have faith that god gives you these things everything's built on faith because there's no way you can buy it you can't get a receipt for it you'd be nice to say well when i get when i get knowledge god's going to give me a receipt and say now you have knowledge that would be wonderful but that's not the way god is because we're going to have knowledge all the way up through right until the end of brother brother brown brought us the word but it takes a five-fold ministry to break it down to the people having faith that some day now not when you want him to come that's the whole problem we want people to see it just as quick as as you tell them exactly ain't gonna happen now some will but some won't right i like the ones that come in kicking and screaming and fighting i've told you that many times before if somebody ever walks in this door and says this is the greatest thing since sliced bread and we've never heard of this and this is the greatest thing and blah blah blah six months later they're gone that's right because they just get a feeling they just get an emotion but somebody that comes in and six months later they're going i don't know about this one god business i don't know about this um i'm still waiting toward you know i go well that's fine you just stay right there right having faith that someday you'll bring him in no that's not what that says that's what we want to do we want to bring them in we want to hold them over the fire no knowing faith that someday god will bring them in all right brotherly thing one kindness three four five six seven program taps on trump work then you're coming now remember he goes over into blasphemous names and continues and expounds on the statue of a perfect man right now in this church age the message is being poured into the church but the church body itself is all together like this tabernacle will say that's where she comes to the church this tabernacle is not a holy ghost tabernacle there's no such thing individuals that come into this church is holy ghost tabernacle right there are tabernacles that contain the holy ghost but not the church body a group therefore it runs out but what this man was pouring now what he's doing is and we're going to read it probably next sunday to just kind of solidify everything together we're going to read sister shepard's dream remember her dream she dreams that she was standing and looking at this thing and he somebody that was water being poured in and brother brown explains all that he talks about honey and he talks about things like that so we're going to do it next sunday but i want to just lay a foundation for this brotherly kind that says we're going to steal brother the kind is pretty good pretty good bet all right but he talked about but this man was pouring the water the messenger to the church pouring the message into the church but what was water doing now it was boiling out all the trash now i really like that he said what's going on morning and i don't have any trash no that's not what's that's not what that right that's not what that uh vision or or dream was all about right there stood sister shepard a holy ghost-filled woman brother branham and type of the man was pouring the water in and what was coming out trash there was still trash in that tabernacle that had to be cleaned out even after the new birth sure it's getting the excess trash out like i told you last sunday we're we're we have our foreskin we have the excess skin taken off at the new birth right right but there's still excess what did i tell you this is your biggest organ of your body your skin is the biggest organ in your body it covers 99 of your body so this is what the problem is your natural heart is not the problem lungs liver whatever it's your skin it's your flesh that's right that's where the problem is all right but now remember that's what these virtues and if it was given and promised it's a requirement then god's made a way for us to do it so it's not unattainable poor little sister shepard was probably just a housewife a little granny that lived at home but god gave her a dream and there was the vision of her going up the statue of a perfect man because that's what it was it was remember it was coming down and then the water was running over her feet right she had something to do with the with the with the vision the water was running on her feet so here we are back to us the water's got to run on our feet and remember feet stands for what redemption she was being born again she had a first birth but peter says being born again see peter's one who could know that because he's the one who went up the statue of a perfect man being born again everybody got that that's good that was the holy spirit that's what the holy spirit does boils it up now now the honey represented brotherly love brotherly kindness which is this age i just got through telling see a brotherly kindness the age that we live in now so the honey represents brotherly kindness well that right here is brother kindness right here and that honey is the holy spirit that brother brown we'll talk about a little bit later but he talks about sealing this in all right we're going to seal this in with something got it we get all the way up here that's one of the people in the message a lot of people say well no you don't get warning angel up here well that's absolutely not true that's right because this is the faith of god the virtue of god the knowledge of god the temple of god the patience of god the godliness of god right and the brother of the kindness of god how are you going to get how are you going to know anything about god if you don't have his spirit in him that's right that's right there's no way you can understand any of this without having the new birth right down here in the baby form no way the people on the day of pentecost they had to get the new birth right peter had to get the new bird before you could understand and write add to your faith virtue your virgin olive temperature peter had to get the new birth before he could say being born again being born again right so that means he was born one time he had to be born again all right being born again but then you come here to this part excuse me we've been having fun for our past few days and we've been talking and laughing and picking up for excuse my excuse my voice but the holy spirit is that honey that seals them because i'm going to tell you something that's like i said before this is god that is jesus christ himself that love that's jesus christ himself that's not love for your wife love for your parents that that has nothing to do with feel your love right feel your love can turn you into it can go to lust right remember brother brown said it starts out against love for your wife then love for your parents and then love for your children then it drops and just keeps right going on down to lust and that's what satan did he took it right on down the lust and the things of the flesh but this is divine love so it's the divine nature of god the holy spirit's sealing everything off but you've got to have that brotherly kindness it's right there and it's very narrow doesn't mean you don't have to have less of it it means that a lot most people are not going to get it right a lot of people are going to get faith but a lot of people are not going to handle that brotherly kindness now the honey represented brotherly love brother the kindness which is this age i just got blue telling of probably kindness the age that we live in now now you might say look i sure don't like brother neville or sure i don't like brother jones i don't like bro so-and-so and something like that but just let something happen to him brother your heart's broken he just nearly killed you see we can obtain brotherly kindness and feeling for one another see but to maintain in a group of people that's the problem you see what he's talking about to maintain that in a group of people why do you care for that brother because you broke bread with him here at the altar as you will tonight you fellowship with him you shook his hand you worship with him he's your brother and he might do something in the flesh that you would disagree with because you just kind of stay what you ought to do but shine him a little but in the bottom of your heart if something happened to that brother it would just nearly kill you or that sister i'm an old man i was once young now i'm old i've seen it down to the ages do that hear people saying i just won't have no more to do with him and something happened to that man it nearly kills him he thinks oh god let my precious brother go without making friends with him you see see see it's brotherly love it looks like it won't stick but it does stick the honey it sticks we may do a little we may do a little part on honey may type it into this part right here we'll see and then let's read this one that's the way god does the church he beats every creed every denomination every man-made dogma until he sees his own life reflecting in you now that's what he's doing here remember these are character developments uh brother keith reed called them the trials of life and that's exactly what it is because remember we read a scripture where i said it pertained to life and godliness so this pertains to natural life that we live and being a christian which should be the same but remember we do do things in life that's not always christian oh you don't i don't mean bob that's right that's right you're the one telling the truth if i do not listen if i do not the works of my father believe me not see if that if what is purpose to the church now what's purpose to the church ii peter that's purpose to the church that's a promise right that by these promises we read these divine promises that you'll receive the divine nature of god the life see what it if what is purpose to the church the life that was in christ isn't reflecting on you don't you stand still if you haven't got patience virtue all these things temperance and things godliness brotherly kindness and all these things that's required of you all right they're required they're not just a pretty chart to look at and something phillip takes me no it's a requirement and it's a holy requirement okay no matter what you've done no matter how much you've shouted how many churches you've joined how many feathers you've pinned into yourself don't do it wait till genuinely from your heart you can forgive to your heart you have brotherly kindness no matter if they pull a handful of beard from one side you can turn the other cheek with sweetness see until those virtues no matter what they say to you so until those virtues come it will matter what people say about you know all these things but when it comes down to where they pulled jesus beard out and they did all the things to him he could have stopped the whole process he could have had him he could they could have been zapped out of existence right that's right he could have done it you could have called ten thousand angels as the song goes but he didn't he says if i do not the works of my father believe me not and then remember when we were talking about godliness we were talking about godliness and here we are at uh at brotherly kindness that godliness just it just to me it flows right over into brother county remember we're going to read the dream next sunday it didn't the the honey didn't flow down to brotherly kindness and stop it flowed all the way down and all the trash that come out it flowed all the way down so in other words it was cleaning that tabernacle out so that god now god dwells in you at the new birth everybody understand that right that's that's god god says i am pleased to dwell in you just like at the river jordan a type where jesus standing there and this is my beloved son who in whom i'm pleased to dwell when you receive the new birth god is pleased to dwell there but he's not pleased with a lot of things that we do but he's pleased to dwell in your soul but remember we got to get that memories and conscious affection we don't worry about see tasteful smelling here right we talked about that last sunday remember that we don't worry about sea taste fields smelling here you can't help seeing what you see in this world right but when you take it down into your memory reason conscious affection and imagination and you cook that thing that's the problem now if you're born again it can't get any further if you're not see my problem was when i wasn't born again there was no filter it just soaked right down into the soul and soul said yeah i like what i see right here right you see what i'm talking about but now since you have a new birth which burnt satan out he can't get into that soul but he can get into that spirit realm he's in that memory reason conscious affection imagination and he's that's his playground but to me these virtues is driving him out now remember we're still going to have our memory of things we've done right up to the chains i don't think god's going to wipe our memory out until we get on the other side amen we're going to and even on the other side we're gonna know where we came from we're just not gonna remember the bad things because the bible says foreign things have passed away behold all things are becoming new we'll be able to sit and talk about the things of god and the glorious things of god we won't talk about the bad things but still the bad things are going to be in our memory but what we have to do is we have to remember one thing if jesus said we can do it and he said he was going to come back remember i was preaching oh my god he's the god of my life brother graham preached that the night after the statue of her of the statue of perfect man he preached the god of my life all right if you take that guide and let him do it now remember you can override that you can you can override that your free moral agency i'm going to make a statement here your free moral agency is more powerful than god because god won't override your free moral agency god's not going to make you do anything right if he is he's a respecter of persons and he made you do this and he can't judge you for it everything has to be what you thought of what you think what you say what you do then god can judge you for that right man that's right i mean i that's the way i see it i if not then we're just a bunch of zombies we just we just get the holy ghost and we you know we're like no god but remember on the other side he foreknew so he knew what you would choose before you chose that's right but he can't make you choose anything right he leaves you on free moral agency to decide what you want to do and then you know what you can be a just judge when you do that but you can't be a just judge if god just says well i picked peggy dale and and i pulled her right through life and and she i had all this waiting well the reason he had all that waiting for us because one day she chose him right right exactly amen that's the way we see in this church foreign knowledge comes before predestination god foreknew those who he for knew he did predestinate the only way he could make your destiny determined beforehand is because he knew before what your destiny was going to be he knew what you would choose he knew that you would go so far at the statue of a perfect man and not going any further he knows that but we don't but he get but he didn't say well now i know bob's only going to come to temperance so i'm not going to give him anything else i'm not going to give him nothing to work with no he gives him everything to work with but he's going to say it at the end he's going to say now bob you stopped the temperance you didn't you didn't have faith to go to knowledge is that okay that all right i mean we are we are we're little gods now when he says we're little gods that's exactly what we are we're little creators we can create this in ourself it's there all right but in brotherly kindness you're gonna have to wrap all these up remember you see what he just said gotta have knowledge number one you gotta have knowledge whether the person's right or wrong temperance remember don't let your temper flare up if you don't agree with you exactly the way you you know see it the way you said have patience and then you know what brother brown they said they billy paul said the one thing about his daddy was you didn't know who his enemies are his friends were another you can't say that about me and i can't say that about me you can't say that about you yeah that's right some of you are close but some of us haven't we know who we're against and who we're for and you know who we're against and who we're for but when you take brother brown with a guy that people hated his guts hated for him to be even be in the room with him yeah he treated him exactly like that person don't tell me that prophet didn't know where there's a familiar spirit and an unfamiliar spirit he knew that he had to override that spirit see that's something we don't do that's good i just got there that's good we have to over we have to override that spirit that tells me that man's against me right because humanly but when they look for love projects brother brown said grace takes over so when love projects that grace will take over and you'll say okay the brother's not right or he's doing something wrong it's just bear with him now look you don't have to get into the slop with it or hurt don't get in the slot with them don't say well i'm not going to church because they're not going to church i'm going to go testify to him on sunday no the best way for you to testify is you'd be here right and then draw them right to you okay let's go upstairs we have a few extra people so when you walk in don't look at somebody like they got
