[2:27] moat
[2:28] and since Kathy I don't know your name
[2:30] before you got married whatever that
[2:32] name is but they changed the law now you
[2:34] can't marry without
[2:36] getting your mom and dad to sign it
[2:38] after 18 and I know you saw when when
[2:40] you married Brother Ray that he was a
[2:42] lot younger than 18 when you
[2:45] swept him off his feet like Joyce did
[2:47] Danny Danny was 14 when they got married

[6:01] in Jesus name we pray amen amen you'll
[6:04] be seated
[6:12] well
[6:14] brother Terence beat me to it but I was
[6:16] going to say something
[6:18] about Brother Ray
[6:19] sister Kathy heaven anniversary today
[6:24] and uh
[6:25] you know we're on the week of
[6:28] the Fourth of July
[6:31] and that's on the fourth of July is when
[6:33] all our liberties and Freedoms
[6:37] come into existence back
[6:40] but 250 years ago I forget what it was
[6:42] anyhow
[6:44] but they're slowly but surely being
[6:46] taken away from us
[6:47] and I think it's because the people
[6:49] forget
[6:50] and I think that that's the reason why
[6:52] we're in a
[6:53] situation well with the scriptures today
[6:55] is
[6:57] they uh
[6:59] coming out of the upper room and on in
[7:01] they started watering it down watering
[7:02] it down you know
[7:04] and we had to have a profit coming in
[7:06] time
[7:07] to straighten all of these things out so
[7:09] anyhow I believe that that's what our
[7:12] situation is and we was talking down
[7:14] there a while ago was getting to wear
[7:15] certain things if a preacher won't marry
[7:18] a
[7:19] uh a gay or a lesbian couple that
[7:24] they'll shut the church down and stuff
[7:25] like that you know and we're getting in
[7:27] that position and the reason why we're
[7:29] getting there is because we're allowing
[7:32] it to happen
[7:34] amen we're going to start off
[7:37] we're going to sing a battle human
[7:38] Republic
[7:39] that's going to be 387 in the red book
[7:43] and it's uh
[7:45] I don't know what the same words or not
[7:47] but it's in the
[7:50] anyhow
[7:52] we invited
[7:58] mine eyes are seeing the glory of the
[8:02] time
[8:14] I don't live
[8:54] even

[25:46] of July
[25:48] and we really thank God for our freedom
[25:51] that we have to at least this time to be
[25:54] able to serve the Lord you know we came
[25:58] to America not as a freedom of religion
[26:02] that's actually not what it was
[26:05] it was a freedom from religion
[26:08] he said well what's the difference well
[26:09] there's a whole lot of difference in
[26:11] being
[26:12] you know from religion or freedom of
[26:14] religion because we you know we came
[26:16] here and you'll see in the message today
[26:19] you know we came here
[26:22] to get away from religious ideas right
[26:25] right that was the reason of coming to
[26:27] America freedom from religion you know
[26:30] to get us away from all of the the
[26:32] man-made ideas and things and and all
[26:35] and the Lord has helped us and blessed
[26:37] us in this nation greatly you know it's
[26:40] fastly going away like brother dick was
[26:42] talking about that you know maybe
[26:44] there'll come a time when if you won't
[26:46] do a wedding for lesbians or gays or
[26:50] whatever uh they'll close the church
[26:52] well there's only one question I want to
[26:54] ask and this is not funny
[26:56] at all
[26:58] if they ask me will I do a wedding for
[27:01] something like that and I refuse to and
[27:04] they closed me up I want them to answer
[27:05] one question
[27:06] is it all right for me to do a wedding
[27:08] for
[27:09] a man or a woman to marry a monkey
[27:17] ain't nobody life and so you know it's
[27:19] not a joke
[27:20] if we believe in evolution
[27:25] and we believe we all evolve from one
[27:27] thing down we just hire a form of animal
[27:30] well why don't you just let the people
[27:31] marry their dogs and their cats and get
[27:33] them off on their income tax
[27:36] that's true right I thought we just saw
[27:39] monkeys but it's all people all the same
[27:42] oh that no no no no no no no no well all
[27:46] right that's what I said it ain't funny
[27:48] it's true it's a serious hour right
[27:51] all right Romans 7
[27:53] uh is that all announcements
[27:57] have I missed any I generally missed
[27:59] some announcement brother George Quinn
[28:00] will be with us on the uh about the
[28:05] Second Sunday in August and I think it's
[28:07] the 10th 11th 11th of August so remember
[28:11] that and be much in prayer for him
[28:12] father we thank you for your love and
[28:14] your grace and to us we pray today that
[28:17] you would just help us and guide us and
[28:19] give us understanding Lord Of Thee in
[28:21] Your Love and Father we pray that you
[28:24] would just come this day and truly we do
[28:27] thank you
[28:28] for our freedom
[28:31] and Lord It's your freedom from a
[28:33] religious Society
[28:35] that a group mankind so much until we
[28:37] came here to try to get away from all of
[28:40] those ideas
[28:41] and establish a land that we could have
[28:43] the freedom that you could not force
[28:46] religion upon anybody
[28:48] that we could all serve thee out of our
[28:51] thoughts of our own minds and hearts and
[28:53] Lord that we see that fastly going away
[28:56] but we know that you said you'd raise up
[28:59] a standard against it so we pray that
[29:02] you would just bless and God we love you
[29:04] and we thank you just have your way Lord
[29:06] let your grace be sufficient for us
[29:08] today as we speak about you in Jesus
[29:11] name
[29:12] Romans 7.
[29:14] oh another thing too uh
[29:17] some of us talking the other day you
[29:19] know we have the ability to now to find
[29:21] out whether or not you that miss the
[29:24] services a lot of times are listening
[29:32] come find out some of you that are
[29:35] missing
[29:36] there's no listening in your town
[29:42] okay
[29:45] see we can just search and see
[29:49] just to get ill if there's anybody in
[29:50] Doraville listening
[29:52] and you say well I listened you say what
[29:54] I
[29:57] okay
[29:59] not funny it's true Romans 7
[30:04] I want to try to bring this to a
[30:06] possible conclusion today
[30:09] maybe be a little bit lent if it is
[30:12] forgiving uh I'll try not to go too far
[30:16] but then we may have we will have
[30:18] questions and answers
[30:20] on this if anybody has any questions
[30:23] anything you know comments Etc turn them
[30:26] in we will try to cover those but trying
[30:29] to bring this down to a conclusion
[30:31] no you're not brethren for I speak to
[30:33] them that know the law
[30:35] how does the law have dominion over a
[30:37] man as long as he liveth for the woman
[30:39] which hath and husband is bound by the
[30:41] law to her husband now remember the
[30:44] prophet said on invisible Union
[30:46] that this is a prophecy for the church
[30:51] in the end times so now what we see here
[30:56] move it from the new birth
[30:59] that's what we want to do today move it
[31:01] from the New Birth up into marital
[31:03] situations of life
[31:05] and then take it into the greater
[31:08] portion he called it
[31:11] of marriage and divorce
[31:13] the greatest portion law and Grace
[31:16] now that's what I'm trying I want to try
[31:18] to bring if I can today to that point
[31:22] so then we see that for which I'm which
[31:25] for the woman which hath and husband is
[31:27] bound by the law to her husband as long
[31:29] as he liveth but if the husband be dead
[31:31] she is loose from the law of her husband
[31:33] so then if while her husband lives
[31:35] she'll be married to another man she
[31:37] shall be called an adulteress but if her
[31:40] husband be dead she is free from that
[31:42] law so that she is no adulteress though
[31:44] she be married to another man
[31:46] wherefore my brother and you also are
[31:48] become dead to the law
[31:50] how by the body of Christ that you
[31:53] should be married to another
[31:55] even to him who is raised from the dead
[31:57] that we should bring forth fruit unto
[32:00] God for when we were in the flesh the
[32:03] Motions of sin which were by the law did
[32:06] work in our members
[32:08] to bring forth fruit unto death see
[32:10] there's your new birth
[32:13] marrying to Christ
[32:15] verse 5.
[32:16] marriage and divorce situations of Life
[32:19] while we were in the flesh
[32:22] the Motions of sin which were by the law
[32:25] you know
[32:26] not the Ten Commandments the law the the
[32:30] things that we interpreted it to be why
[32:32] did the prophet say we had to marriage
[32:34] in divorce situation misinterpreted
[32:36] theology
[32:37] all right now watch through this next
[32:39] verse but now we are delivered from the
[32:42] law
[32:43] that being dead wherein we were hail
[32:45] that we should serve in the newness of
[32:48] the spirit
[32:50] and not in the oldest of the letter you
[32:53] may be seated the Lord had his Blessing
[32:55] to the reading of the word what is it
[32:57] the scripture the letter killeth
[33:01] but the spirit giveth life all right now
[33:04] as I said
[33:05] a prophecy
[33:08] for the church that's paragraph 23
[33:10] invisible Union
[33:13] he said this is pertaining Romans 7 to a
[33:16] greater portion of marriage and divorce
[33:18] paragraph 35
[33:20] which unfolds one of the great mysteries
[33:22] of Prophecy what is it we talk about
[33:25] prophecy a setting in order of
[33:27] scriptures
[33:28] aligning up of scriptures
[33:31] of showing that what you start with in
[33:34] Genesis you wind up in Revelations
[33:38] not changing and having a white horse
[33:40] here and a black horse here and
[33:43] doing those things but coming to a basis
[33:46] of seeing something all the way through
[33:49] the Bible
[33:50] all right and then coming out to the end
[33:52] to where we're at
[33:54] now
[33:55] remember what we were speaking about and
[33:57] been speaking on of the the church
[34:00] choosing law for Grace or
[34:04] instead of Grace
[34:07] thinking it was Grace or God's will
[34:14] and then thinking about it as we've
[34:16] tried to bring out the other day in a
[34:18] couple of messages
[34:20] that the children of Israel did not want
[34:23] a great big bunch of burdensome roots
[34:27] I mean I don't believe that if you do
[34:29] then that's all right that's your
[34:31] business but I'm I'm just don't think
[34:33] that away
[34:35] and you know who would want to stand on
[34:37] your head for the rest of your life
[34:39] you say watch silly they wouldn't have
[34:41] done that well it's burden some rules
[34:44] any rules you have is a burdensome thing
[34:46] to try to follow
[34:48] unless you want to do it out of love
[34:51] now come on sisters be honest with me
[34:54] sometimes it's a burdensome thing to
[34:57] have long hair
[35:00] right
[35:02] because you got to fix it you got to do
[35:03] it you got to do everything
[35:06] but yet why is it that you have the long
[35:08] hair
[35:11] because you know it's following the word
[35:14] because the word tells you not to cut
[35:17] your heart
[35:18] and then the scripture says even don't
[35:21] don't the the nature teach you
[35:25] your nature of a new birth
[35:28] puts you to a position that when you're
[35:30] combing that higher and fixing that you
[35:31] may be saying well you know this is
[35:33] burdensome
[35:35] but yet I'm doing it out of love
[35:39] it's not a burdensome thing to be a
[35:41] Christian
[35:45] it's not a book of rules to be a
[35:47] Christian
[35:49] it's an opportunity to serve God from an
[35:53] inward experience
[35:55] of a life
[35:57] that would be made outwardly that
[36:01] if there would be no other reason than
[36:03] be then just try to show the world
[36:06] to God in your life
[36:09] all right now you see why did I spoke a
[36:12] couple of services about
[36:15] that the children of Israel wanted to be
[36:17] like the neighbors
[36:18] the Nations around them
[36:21] that was what they were wanting
[36:23] not a book of rules to keep
[36:26] put something to be like the others they
[36:27] could see those people doing things and
[36:30] working and building churches and and
[36:32] God was just
[36:34] letting them just travel along
[36:39] right
[36:42] they wanted to be like the neighbors
[36:47] and they got down into it trying to
[36:49] express it there the other night
[36:51] what is it that we want to do
[36:54] well we want to go through rituals like
[36:55] the so-and-so does
[36:57] you know churches denomination
[37:00] we want to speak in tongues like the
[37:01] Pentecostals we want to do this we want
[37:03] to do that we want to have something
[37:05] that we can train a people come up and
[37:07] get them to go back and you know that's
[37:09] done in organized religion it's either
[37:11] get up and make a statement
[37:13] then you got to make it perfectly
[37:16] like you told me in the when I was being
[37:18] ordained as a deacon at 23 years old
[37:20] some of the old deacons told me said
[37:23] you know
[37:25] if you don't have an answer
[37:27] just tell them you don't have an answer
[37:29] don't try to make up one because it
[37:31] they'll trap you
[37:33] well see he'd been through it himself
[37:36] you know but
[37:38] but the thing that I've tried to get you
[37:40] to see is
[37:42] they wanted to be like the Nations
[37:45] around them
[37:50] but you know God never did want them to
[37:52] be a nation
[37:56] well they're called a nation of it right
[37:57] there's a reason for that
[38:01] see they were not to be a nation
[38:04] none whatsoever
[38:06] until they had crossed the land the
[38:09] Jordan River into Canaan land
[38:13] it was the only time they were to be
[38:14] settled down
[38:16] right
[38:19] they were the people of God
[38:25] God told them there in Exodus 19. you
[38:28] are this your Royal peace or you're this
[38:30] you're a great people
[38:33] they wanted to be a nation
[38:36] I didn't want him to be a nation
[38:41] he didn't want him to settle down in no
[38:43] place
[38:46] but once they crossed into Canaan right
[38:48] they could settle down and God could use
[38:50] the word of nation for him but he didn't
[38:52] want him to do that in the beginning
[38:55] you know what they were
[38:57] little brown said when they were down in
[38:59] Egypt
[39:00] he said they were the people of God
[39:06] he said but then when they left Egypt
[39:09] in their Journey they became the Church
[39:12] of God the called out
[39:16] see they should have waited until he
[39:18] went to Canaan
[39:19] to even think about a nation or a
[39:21] nationality or or whatever because they
[39:24] they wasn't they were just so many from
[39:27] tribe of Judah so many from the tribe of
[39:29] this so many of these tribes
[39:32] they were just fellowshiping together
[39:36] because they were Ken folks
[39:38] you know but they had tribes set aside
[39:41] not didn't want him to be a nation
[39:44] God don't want us to settle down
[39:48] he's always wanted the people to move on
[39:52] that's where the trouble was see they
[39:54] settled down in the days of Martin
[39:55] Luther and formed an organization out of
[39:58] it
[40:00] tried to be a nation like everybody else
[40:02] wanting to be a nation you know
[40:07] we're not a nation we're individuals
[40:12] right God don't deal with Nations
[40:17] but around the city don't deal with two
[40:18] people at the time you say well that's
[40:20] just talking about a prophet well that
[40:21] wasn't exactly all of it or he he
[40:24] doesn't deal with two people at the same
[40:25] time he deals with an individual
[40:29] now as individuals
[40:31] then we can form into as to being what
[40:35] we are called to be of the parts we are
[40:38] to be of the body of Christ
[40:40] with a hand armed feet you know we can
[40:43] become an organism
[40:47] as the body of Christ
[40:52] but like Israel
[40:54] we form an organization
[40:59] and when we do we denominate and die
[41:06] where is any denomination that ever
[41:09] formed
[41:10] organized and formed come back to be any
[41:13] church that God is dealing with
[41:19] and he said but they're having revivals
[41:21] they're having this and having that
[41:26] well
[41:28] don't you see my whole point of what I'm
[41:30] driving there the children of Israel
[41:32] looked over and seen them people over
[41:33] there
[41:35] and they were working theirself to death
[41:36] for their gods
[41:38] and they wanted to do it
[41:40] they were never just happy to say we're
[41:43] the people of God
[41:45] if we need help we just call on the
[41:47] prophet
[41:49] because that's what Nathan and core said
[41:51] you're too spiritual
[41:54] you know you you want nobody to have it
[41:56] with you
[41:59] they couldn't believe us he said to one
[42:01] man message
[42:04] nah
[42:05] thinking about those things because
[42:07] that's what I'm looking down on the
[42:09] notes
[42:11] of the prophet
[42:13] they were never chosen to be a nation I
[42:16] said that Wednesday and I knew that
[42:18] probably it didn't go over by a lot of
[42:20] people so we'll read a little bit about
[42:22] it
[42:24] but
[42:26] there was never to be a nation
[42:31] see when I say something some of you
[42:32] here you know maybe argue that point
[42:36] Lee well what do you mean of the nation
[42:38] of Israel well that's why I read what
[42:40] the prophet said
[42:43] then you're not arguing with me
[42:46] you're arguing with him
[42:48] all right
[42:49] so then let's get a few little points
[42:51] out of the way
[42:52] and then we'll get into the thought of
[42:54] the message go ahead and pull up number
[42:55] one which is a tie Tire in church age
[42:59] in 1960 1208.
[43:03] look what he says
[43:05] coming down has not just Doctrine to
[43:07] Bible we found out last night that
[43:09] Israel coming through Moab
[43:12] there was not a nation
[43:16] it wasn't a nation
[43:18] they dwelled in the face upon the face
[43:22] of the Earth
[43:23] and they was a people free
[43:27] is that right
[43:31] there was no Nation
[43:35] like I said the only time they would
[43:37] have had a point of being a nation would
[43:39] have been when they went into the land
[43:40] of Canaan
[43:41] and then they would settle down with
[43:43] building a temple
[43:45] building a a worship thing
[43:48] and building a central location for them
[43:50] all to be kind of linked around
[43:53] up until that time it was never to been
[43:55] nothing like that
[43:59] it was not to be a nation look at the
[44:01] next one I'll read
[44:03] look at number two dedication of a
[44:04] building 59 708 in the morning
[44:09] God dwells among his people
[44:11] as he called him out of Egypt they were
[44:14] the people of God
[44:15] now look he chose them as a nation
[44:18] well you know you just got to say anyone
[44:20] the nation Angel it wasn't a nation when
[44:22] it come out
[44:25] that's words that's getting over to a
[44:28] point that he chose them out of the
[44:30] Nations
[44:32] it wasn't chosen to be a nation well
[44:34] that's what he said now
[44:36] we'll go ahead do what you want to
[44:39] but he said to Peculiar people or royal
[44:41] priesthood he chose this certain people
[44:43] but as long as they were dwelling in
[44:45] Egypt and Scattered they were the people
[44:47] of God
[44:48] but when he called him out they then
[44:50] were then the Church of God because the
[44:53] word church means separated called out
[44:55] they become the Church of God
[44:58] the
[44:59] not a nation
[45:01] they become the Church of God
[45:03] okay look at the next one Earnest we
[45:05] continue for the face it was once to
[45:07] deliver to the Saints 53 614 a
[45:11] God said I've seen him from the hilltops
[45:14] Hallelujah his church his group one day
[45:16] wasn't a nation
[45:20] there wasn't an organized like the rest
[45:22] of the people
[45:24] they win the nation they weren't
[45:25] organized
[45:26] they had organism
[45:29] but no Nation
[45:31] he said the people will dwell among
[45:34] themselves
[45:35] there will not be a nation
[45:37] and that's the way the Church of God
[45:39] today
[45:40] the called out group of people
[45:43] it doesn't mean because it's your
[45:46] Methodist here it doesn't mean because
[45:47] you're a pinnacle it means out of every
[45:50] group
[45:53] God's calling people giving them the
[45:56] Holy Ghost and that's the the church the
[46:00] called out certainly it is he calls them
[46:02] out they're not an organization
[46:05] they're an organism
[46:07] their hearts are beating together
[46:09] they're one in Christ Jesus Hallelujah
[46:14] all right now watch what he says in the
[46:16] next one
[46:17] just once more Lord
[46:20] 63 uh one
[46:23] 120 in the evening
[46:28] a paragraph
[46:31] just wants more and that we're on
[46:33] yeah excuse me I'm on it you got it
[46:37] this is sure
[46:38] there's somewhere and then you got
[46:39] number four yeah
[46:41] that was just another about organization
[46:44] where he said brother run said he
[46:46] rejects organization
[46:47] he don't reject organism
[46:50] but organization
[46:52] organism we have to have that
[46:56] the children of Israel
[46:58] were a chosen people but when one of
[47:02] them got into trouble they all went
[47:04] right
[47:06] because they were the people of God
[47:08] don't want us to be a nation
[47:11] he wants us to be his people
[47:14] serve him
[47:17] as an individual
[47:20] to be what is done and then you see then
[47:22] the show that is right you'd see in each
[47:24] case sometimes like uh the the great
[47:28] ones that would raise up
[47:29] and fought
[47:32] you know and kill people
[47:35] individuals
[47:37] he doesn't want us a nation
[47:41] but we only do like the Baptist we want
[47:42] to get a prettier Church
[47:44] we want to build a bigger building
[47:46] we want to get everything just right
[47:49] we want to be like them
[47:52] well we're not supposed to be like them
[47:56] that's why in this church as long as I
[47:59] stay here as a pastor there'll never be
[48:01] a membership role
[48:05] because you don't join the body of
[48:07] Christ
[48:08] you're born into it
[48:11] there's no membership here it's not
[48:12] where you you come here
[48:15] you know nobody puts a collection plate
[48:18] under your nose expecting you to pay
[48:20] your tithe
[48:21] I expect all Christians to
[48:26] so if you're here anywhere else I'd
[48:27] expect you to
[48:29] because that's a Christian if you don't
[48:31] then I question your Christianity
[48:34] come on
[48:36] it's no problem but we're not to be
[48:39] we're supposed we're not to be like them
[48:43] no
[48:44] don't you think we could get this
[48:45] together
[48:47] oh brother dick don't mind this one but
[48:49] he said when we first met see he was in
[48:51] that Presbyterian and they had their
[48:53] four spiritual laws and ways of
[48:55] explaining he said ain't there some way
[48:56] we can get this together as a group to
[48:58] explain it
[49:00] I told him in
[49:01] I said can't be done
[49:05] well I know that kind of throat him
[49:07] because he wasn't thinking my way
[49:10] it can't be done
[49:13] you can't put this message
[49:17] into a cubicle of some form or from and
[49:20] try to pass it out to the people that
[49:22] way because everybody's an individual
[49:28] everybody's an individual
[49:31] I'd like to deal with you individually
[49:33] because you're an individual I'd like to
[49:35] talk to you individually
[49:39] you see that when we go outside I I go
[49:41] and shake hands with everybody
[49:44] because it's individuals
[49:47] if I don't shake your hand it's your
[49:49] fault
[49:50] go and I do try
[49:53] individuals then make up the body of
[49:56] Christ
[49:57] in that way
[49:59] the body of Christ is the called out
[50:03] of the system right
[50:05] so God don't reject
[50:07] organisms but he rejects organizations
[50:12] he said what's a different organization
[50:14] organism
[50:15] an organization says this is it or the
[50:18] period on the end of it an organism says
[50:20] this is the word of God with a comma
[50:22] anything God will reveal
[50:25] well no bless God we're in the message
[50:27] now what's an organization Spirit jump
[50:29] up we're in the message this is the it
[50:31] this is it this is the period this is
[50:33] the period this message is a period
[50:36] and when you do that you know what
[50:37] you've done you just died
[50:41] I don't care
[50:44] you don't make nothing for me
[50:47] we're individuals
[50:51] when you denominate the prophet said you
[50:54] die you organize you die
[50:56] you say this is it don't you believe
[50:58] brother Dale this message is it yes but
[51:01] there's a message of tear down through
[51:03] the endless ages that this Prophet spoke
[51:06] of so he put a comma onto his sermon
[51:10] his message
[51:12] never ended with a period
[51:16] he said there'll be a message of tear
[51:18] down through the ages to come after we
[51:20] leave here
[51:22] so he never denominated it
[51:24] he never organized it
[51:27] let's see if we say this is it we ain't
[51:30] taking nothing else
[51:34] remember we ain't got that message of
[51:36] Jerry yet
[51:38] so what if you turn that down
[51:41] listen Church
[51:43] I think it's you know finishing up time
[51:46] I believe it's a very serious hour
[51:49] all right
[51:50] but listen God deals with individuals
[51:56] watch what he says on the next one
[51:58] getting these in the way and through and
[52:00] then we'll read look at number five
[52:02] which is just once more
[52:07] watch what he says happen now
[52:09] the church
[52:10] this is just once more 63 uh 112 an
[52:14] evening
[52:15] the church Pentecostal Church turned
[52:17] right back around and married into the
[52:19] thing that God pulled him out
[52:23] four
[52:24] right
[52:26] that's what he says
[52:28] can't deal with a group
[52:32] God can't deal with a group
[52:34] one two people two opinions
[52:39] right
[52:41] two people two opinions right God deals
[52:44] with an individual it's always been his
[52:46] policy two men has got two different
[52:48] ideas God gets one man in his that's all
[52:52] he has
[52:53] to have one man that's what he's trying
[52:56] to get today he's trying to get you in
[52:59] his hand because I ain't speaking just
[53:01] him is it you in his hand he'll take one
[53:04] year and one dire it'll never be a group
[53:08] she'll just get that out of your mind
[53:12] well brother don't you think that we
[53:14] could come on you know compromise a
[53:18] little bit and associate with some of
[53:19] these churches
[53:24] I don't compromise to associate
[53:30] I've been accused of being an antichrist
[53:32] spirit because I go to the fellowship
[53:33] meeting
[53:36] and I don't tell you to go
[53:39] if you want to
[53:41] you're welcome to Ride Along
[53:44] all right
[53:47] because I'm not going to compromise with
[53:49] nobody
[53:51] you remember we were red right around
[53:52] and said the Christian businessmen was
[53:54] the only group he was a member of he
[53:57] said but when they organize I'll get out
[53:59] of it he was talking to the businessman
[54:01] at the time
[54:09] he said I don't want to get around them
[54:10] spirits well go ahead go to Walmart
[54:12] while we're going to the fellowship
[54:13] meeting
[54:16] no that don't go over good does it
[54:19] that makes me a smart alec
[54:22] I might be an illick but I never have
[54:24] been smart
[54:26] when you're organized right then you
[54:27] lose watch what he said now
[54:31] when you organize or read it to you the
[54:34] other day he said you die
[54:36] look what he says happen when you
[54:38] organize right then you lose
[54:42] you're you lose your Birthright
[54:46] I want to ask any person
[54:48] where did you ever see a man raise up
[54:51] with the message of God and as soon as
[54:53] he left the Earth they organized it and
[54:56] as soon as they organized it died and
[54:59] never did come back again
[55:02] now show me one of them I'm honest Today
[55:04] Show me one of them well my churches
[55:06] look at what's going on yeah
[55:09] and what do you got in church
[55:14] painted face Jezebel shorts wearing
[55:20] even bikinis in some
[55:22] you call that of God but it never was
[55:24] come back
[55:26] it's not an ounce of the Living God in
[55:27] there your thermometer is gone it's 40
[55:29] below zero
[55:33] he says you lose your Birthright now you
[55:35] mean to tell me another I'm honest
[55:41] if you lose your Birthright
[55:45] that really means you must not have
[55:47] never had the birth
[55:48] you just had to birth right
[55:51] you were in line for it
[55:56] but if we went back and went to an
[55:58] organized religion today then I'd be
[56:00] proven I never had anything to start
[56:02] with
[56:03] I mean that's
[56:05] no problem
[56:08] it wouldn't be that way but see God
[56:11] deals with individuals
[56:14] what organizations do is one thing I
[56:17] want to just get this and then because
[56:19] I'm bringing down this point then we'll
[56:20] quit and preach a little while look at
[56:23] the next one what he talks about what
[56:25] organizations do
[56:28] which is Satan's eating I had a whole
[56:30] page of Satan's Eden I'd suggest you
[56:32] listen to the whole message
[56:34] 65 829 Satan's Eden paragraph 65. and he
[56:39] said he would exalt himself above the
[56:41] most high
[56:42] he would Ascend above the clouds and the
[56:45] stars and he would sit like he would sit
[56:47] there like God and be above the most
[56:50] high and he has succeeded in carrying
[56:54] out his stretch
[56:57] brother Reynolds said one time when they
[56:59] accepted Barabbas
[57:02] and rejected Jesus it exalted Satan to
[57:06] the throne that he wanted
[57:09] now look what organized religion does
[57:14] my brother Dallas Good Feet right we're
[57:16] not against organisms
[57:19] we're against what did the prophet say
[57:22] the system
[57:25] the system
[57:27] you ever looked up word system
[57:30] let me get that before we even go too
[57:32] far you ever looked up the word system
[57:35] to see why brother random was against
[57:37] the system
[57:39] well I know because it was
[57:41] systematically it means
[57:42] a system is an assemblage
[57:47] our combination
[57:50] of things or parts
[57:54] forming a complex
[57:57] or unitary hold
[58:01] you turn w-h-o-l-e-ho
[58:06] it's an ordered or comprehensive
[58:09] assemblage
[58:12] of facts principles or methods
[58:15] what is a system then
[58:18] why would he be against a system
[58:20] a system would be the organization of
[58:22] gathering together an assemblies he was
[58:25] against the organization not against the
[58:26] organism
[58:29] you say I'm not even against
[58:31] organization because he said that's all
[58:32] right that'll lead you there you know
[58:34] they can do good things
[58:37] but where are we at
[58:40] if you can't see by the last couple of
[58:42] messages I've preached now and I know
[58:45] this is hard and I'm sorry
[58:47] but the biggest portion of the people of
[58:49] this message had already organized
[58:52] if you can't see that then you're blind
[58:54] so I'm not talking to y'all just
[58:56] preaching the rest of them you get your
[58:57] eyes open one day you'll see what I'm
[58:59] talking about
[59:01] be that way give us a little something
[59:03] do something what
[59:05] sugar tits
[59:08] when we're supposed to be Sons and
[59:10] Daughters of God I thought the prophet
[59:11] said that you couldn't hurt a child of
[59:13] God's feelings
[59:15] that was my understanding did I miss it
[59:18] somewhere no
[59:19] I'm sure that don't mean all my feelings
[59:21] can't be heard
[59:22] he didn't say his feelings couldn't be
[59:24] hurt
[59:26] but what you can't
[59:29] take a person that's born again they're
[59:31] going to understand
[59:33] and if even they don't understand they
[59:34] don't understand one thing they'll pray
[59:35] for you
[59:37] right
[59:38] because that's what we're supposed to be
[59:39] as Christians
[59:40] but look at what he's talking about
[59:46] and look what people do
[59:48] he said it was all himself Satan's he
[59:50] succeeded in carrying out his stress
[59:52] he has certainly had a marvelous success
[59:54] in carrying out his stress
[59:57] how by the people letting him explain
[1:00:02] away
[1:00:04] in every age
[1:00:10] the value of God's promised word to that
[1:00:13] age
[1:00:15] now he succeeded in explaining the way
[1:00:18] in every age
[1:00:19] the value
[1:00:21] of God's promised word to that age
[1:00:25] right
[1:00:27] now watch
[1:00:30] that's exactly how he's done it in every
[1:00:33] age
[1:00:34] he explained it away
[1:00:38] all right
[1:00:39] so whatever age he has succeeded in
[1:00:43] explaining away the truth
[1:00:47] and he said the reason we're into this
[1:00:51] problem with marriage and divorce is
[1:00:52] misinterpreted theology
[1:00:55] why is it there so many churches in the
[1:00:57] world today when we all claim to be
[1:00:59] serving the same God
[1:01:04] I have to agree somewhere I believe
[1:01:06] somebody missed it
[1:01:07] don't you
[1:01:09] I think that's the problem
[1:01:12] but
[1:01:13] Satan's what does he do in the church
[1:01:16] age book he said it his way was to
[1:01:18] discredit God's word
[1:01:21] all right now what do you see in the
[1:01:23] people of this message of preachers
[1:01:25] what are they doing they're discrediting
[1:01:28] the prophet to try to show that he's
[1:01:29] wrong
[1:01:33] right
[1:01:36] and when they can discredit that profit
[1:01:39] then you won't believe him
[1:01:44] okay
[1:01:46] so they explain it away now let's go
[1:01:49] with that
[1:01:50] first is discredited
[1:01:53] then explain it away
[1:01:57] what's the difference in somebody saying
[1:01:58] brother random was wrong
[1:02:00] on dates or wrong on this or wrong on
[1:02:02] that
[1:02:04] in the spiritual realm now what's the
[1:02:05] difference in that didn't explain in the
[1:02:07] way what he taught
[1:02:16] if we explain away what he taught
[1:02:19] then the people can't be ready
[1:02:24] I don't
[1:02:25] say things to be horrible I know you
[1:02:27] think I am
[1:02:29] but some of you saw the man that was
[1:02:31] supposed to be flying the airplane to
[1:02:33] haul blood around him around
[1:02:34] him and his brothers some of you saw the
[1:02:37] videos
[1:02:38] he said for that plane to be able to fly
[1:02:40] take two years to get it together
[1:02:43] so he plainly telling you Lord can't
[1:02:45] come for two years
[1:02:49] I told you my opinion
[1:02:51] if I believe he's going to do that
[1:02:54] I'd Hawk and steal everything I could
[1:02:56] get to get me a 747 and a
[1:02:59] in about 10 Pilots where I can make sure
[1:03:01] they would all somebody could fly the
[1:03:03] booger you know he'd be sitting on the
[1:03:06] runway and every day they'd have to fly
[1:03:09] and they'd have to remodel it
[1:03:14] what
[1:03:15] you say that's wrong
[1:03:19] in front of mohammad's grave
[1:03:22] they have a white horse a guard standing
[1:03:26] and they changed a white horse every
[1:03:29] four hours
[1:03:36] so evidently they believe more than we
[1:03:38] do
[1:03:39] I know it that makes me sarcastic
[1:03:42] hateful arrogant
[1:03:44] amen
[1:03:46] find a few more things you can say about
[1:03:47] me
[1:03:51] it was like I've always said my worst
[1:03:53] enemy knows one thing
[1:03:56] I've got one thing in mind that I said
[1:03:58] Wednesday night
[1:03:59] that's to bring you an opportunity to be
[1:04:03] able to receive the word of God
[1:04:06] what else is with it I don't care
[1:04:09] if I die and go to hell that's what I my
[1:04:11] appointees and wanting to do
[1:04:13] is to get you an opportunity to see
[1:04:16] Jesus Christ
[1:04:18] now
[1:04:23] so with that out of the way now for a
[1:04:25] little bit let me just preach to you
[1:04:32] Heaven helped me to express it the way
[1:04:33] that I've
[1:04:35] see it
[1:04:37] I told you and asked you to the
[1:04:39] beginning to take the invisible Union
[1:04:41] and read it over and over and over
[1:04:44] and in that invisible Union you would
[1:04:47] find
[1:04:48] three things that he dealt with
[1:04:52] one of them is
[1:04:54] your new birth
[1:04:59] and he was dealing with that new birth
[1:05:00] to show us that our old husband
[1:05:04] which was our old nature
[1:05:07] coming from the fall
[1:05:09] it made us lost
[1:05:12] that that was her old husband
[1:05:14] and that old husband wasn't just to be
[1:05:16] divorced and put away
[1:05:18] he's supposed to be dead
[1:05:20] if he's not dead we're not born again
[1:05:22] and we're not free
[1:05:24] we're not a Christian if that old
[1:05:26] husband is still alive now you're
[1:05:28] looking at the old husband the body and
[1:05:31] spirit of this individual standing here
[1:05:33] because it's still in his domain
[1:05:36] and still belonging and
[1:05:40] operating sometimes according to him you
[1:05:43] know the devil
[1:05:44] right
[1:05:45] now brother Dale don't talk about me and
[1:05:47] my flesh like that well
[1:05:50] turn it off
[1:05:53] what do you see when I'm trying to bring
[1:05:55] you you read that in invisible Union
[1:05:58] he said that old husband's got to be
[1:05:59] dead
[1:06:00] for you to be married to Christ the word
[1:06:02] the old husband has got to be dead
[1:06:07] then he moves on into him talking about
[1:06:09] and he says this is about marriage and
[1:06:12] divorce and it gives a little bit on the
[1:06:14] marriage and divorce situation
[1:06:18] all right then we know and realized it
[1:06:20] when he did preach marriage and divorce
[1:06:25] that as that day came about there were
[1:06:28] people there that were married four or
[1:06:29] five times he said they were three four
[1:06:31] times or something
[1:06:36] but yet by the grace that he gave they
[1:06:39] went home
[1:06:40] with one wife and one husband if they
[1:06:42] really believed it
[1:06:46] now what did he cover on the new birth
[1:06:49] sin to the individual is put into
[1:06:53] the Sea of his forgetfulness
[1:06:56] everybody else around you can remember
[1:06:58] it but God can't
[1:07:01] okay
[1:07:03] so you get into the marriage and divorce
[1:07:04] situation
[1:07:07] and when you do
[1:07:09] you know literal things
[1:07:11] and you see that
[1:07:13] you needed the grace
[1:07:15] but if you can believe it
[1:07:18] that it's for you
[1:07:20] then you can be free from your marital
[1:07:22] situation
[1:07:25] but to go and hide won't do you no good
[1:07:28] as I said you can always find another
[1:07:30] organ an organization somewhere in this
[1:07:34] message
[1:07:34] it will let you go there and tell you
[1:07:37] you're free
[1:07:39] well see I can't do that
[1:07:42] I can't tell you you have the new birth
[1:07:48] right because I don't know
[1:07:51] because you're the only one that knows
[1:07:56] I can't tell you
[1:07:58] you're okay
[1:08:01] in your physical life
[1:08:04] I can tell you and point you to the
[1:08:07] message in Christ
[1:08:10] but I can tell you
[1:08:13] by the new birth
[1:08:14] if you have it
[1:08:17] then that old husband
[1:08:20] of the world of natural world
[1:08:24] is dead
[1:08:28] then we can be as Paul would say not I
[1:08:30] that liveth but Christ that liveth in me
[1:08:33] that old husband is dead
[1:08:36] then if you can truly believe it
[1:08:39] and follow it correctly and line up with
[1:08:42] it
[1:08:44] that you can say
[1:08:46] my old marriage
[1:08:49] and where I've been married before
[1:08:52] is placed in the sea of his
[1:08:53] forgetfulness because that's what that
[1:08:55] Prophet said when he said that day go
[1:08:58] home as you are
[1:09:01] right
[1:09:03] he said Paul saw his people in this
[1:09:05] shape Moses saw these people he said and
[1:09:08] God counted righteousness
[1:09:11] so God put
[1:09:14] our old magical lives and things into
[1:09:18] his sea of forgetfulness
[1:09:24] but then I don't agree with
[1:09:26] people that would say
[1:09:28] what if you got the new birth
[1:09:31] everything's taken care of
[1:09:33] that's only for the soul
[1:09:36] right well
[1:09:38] I've always said that and I said stay
[1:09:40] with it
[1:09:42] that new birth is only for the soul is
[1:09:44] not the body and spirit
[1:09:49] then if we have problems in life we have
[1:09:52] to straighten them up
[1:09:53] why would if it's true that your new
[1:09:56] birth takes care of everything his
[1:09:58] people want to believe
[1:09:59] why would it be that Prophet would have
[1:10:02] to preach marriage and divorce
[1:10:06] all right why would he be on invisible
[1:10:08] Union to say
[1:10:12] if you women said you've done something
[1:10:14] wrong in your life and said you don't
[1:10:16] tell your husband
[1:10:18] he said in 10 years later you tell him
[1:10:20] he said he has a right to put you away
[1:10:22] in Mary again
[1:10:25] that's what he said
[1:10:27] why would you need that it was a new
[1:10:29] birth
[1:10:30] you birth just wipe everybody clean
[1:10:34] another New Birth just started a process
[1:10:36] of us being clean
[1:10:43] and then we get into marriage and
[1:10:45] divorce into the literal and we look at
[1:10:46] it and we say well
[1:10:48] there's any hopes for me
[1:10:50] only through Christ Jesus
[1:10:54] but it's like I say go ahead
[1:10:57] you can go somewhere and find you a
[1:10:58] church he says you're okay
[1:11:00] they'll make you deacons preachers and
[1:11:02] things
[1:11:02] but we take that stand here
[1:11:06] and we operate according to
[1:11:10] you know
[1:11:11] if a man's been married twice he's not
[1:11:13] going to be the preacher here
[1:11:19] he said well people have done that yeah
[1:11:21] because I had nothing to do with that
[1:11:22] they started preaching before I come
[1:11:24] come along I'm saying what I'm dealing
[1:11:26] with
[1:11:30] are you saying brother so-and-so's wrong
[1:11:34] that's none of my business and none of
[1:11:36] yours
[1:11:38] that's between so and so and God
[1:11:42] you get upset at me because you're
[1:11:43] saying I made my statement right for you
[1:11:45] to listen I said people have done things
[1:11:48] and married before they come here to
[1:11:50] this church I have nothing to do with
[1:11:52] that
[1:11:58] but I do have something to do with this
[1:12:00] church
[1:12:01] as being pastor
[1:12:05] and that's why we don't put nobody in
[1:12:07] office
[1:12:09] as a deacon
[1:12:12] that's been married before
[1:12:16] or the wife being married before
[1:12:18] you know
[1:12:20] because we keep that as a rule
[1:12:22] huh
[1:12:24] but
[1:12:26] to do that see that makes it into a
[1:12:28] situation
[1:12:30] was sometimes horrible but that's all
[1:12:31] right I have to take my stand and I've
[1:12:34] took it and I've made my stand
[1:12:36] all right
[1:12:38] what you see
[1:12:39] there is a Grace of marriage and divorce
[1:12:43] if you can believe it
[1:12:47] but you got to accept it
[1:12:49] and you can only get it from God
[1:12:52] you can't get it from no man I don't
[1:12:54] care where you go
[1:12:58] just because somebody had walked up you
[1:13:01] think I'm all right brother I'm gonna
[1:13:02] shake your hand over there
[1:13:05] you take that handshake cleans you
[1:13:08] ain't but one way to be clean
[1:13:10] that's when God can put it in there sea
[1:13:12] of his forgetfulness
[1:13:17] in your marital situations can be
[1:13:19] cleaned
[1:13:23] because if not that old husband is still
[1:13:25] alive
[1:13:26] and you know we're all
[1:13:28] women in the body of Christ feminist
[1:13:31] so then our problem was
[1:13:35] the other situation we're going to deal
[1:13:37] with now
[1:13:39] that we all had an old denominational
[1:13:41] husband
[1:13:44] whether we ever went to a church or not
[1:13:49] now don't just don't just get it plain
[1:13:51] see
[1:13:52] where we ever went to a church or not we
[1:13:54] had an old denominational husband
[1:13:58] and that denominational husband bound Us
[1:14:01] by things that he explained away
[1:14:08] and see that's the guy we got to deal
[1:14:10] with now
[1:14:13] the new bird sets the soul free
[1:14:17] the marriage and divorce the grace can
[1:14:19] set the bodies or whatever you want to
[1:14:21] call it Spirit body free in that basis
[1:14:29] but
[1:14:30] we've got to have something to set us
[1:14:32] free from that Old husband called
[1:14:34] denominations
[1:14:39] I never was in one brother Dale I have
[1:14:41] you to know well okay
[1:14:43] it makes you one by yourself
[1:14:46] foreign
[1:14:52] started the first organization
[1:14:57] right
[1:14:59] she organized in the garden
[1:15:02] with the devil speaking to her through
[1:15:03] the Beast
[1:15:05] and caused us to be like we are
[1:15:07] that's why brother random we'll call her
[1:15:09] our adulterous mother Eve
[1:15:12] that's an invisible Union right
[1:15:16] or adulterous
[1:15:19] and you know who we were mad from
[1:15:23] you say if if I can just prove that I
[1:15:26] was come from Adam I'm all right that's
[1:15:28] what they preach in the message if you
[1:15:30] come from Adam you're capable of being
[1:15:32] saved but if you come from the Beast you
[1:15:34] ain't capable of being saved
[1:15:36] that's the doctrine since I started in
[1:15:38] the message 40 something years ago
[1:15:41] when my Bible says in Adam all die so it
[1:15:43] blames Adam
[1:15:47] then it says Eve is the mother of all
[1:15:49] living
[1:15:55] so she's the mother of all living then
[1:15:57] what it brought around to say
[1:16:00] he said we were all born between Satan
[1:16:05] and Eve
[1:16:07] he may have used the word devil there
[1:16:09] and Eve but it's the same old guy
[1:16:13] we were all born in sin shaping and
[1:16:16] iniquity espoused where mother's wound
[1:16:19] so I don't care how pure your lineage is
[1:16:24] Abel his brother Bob was preaching this
[1:16:26] morning
[1:16:27] he made a sacrifice
[1:16:31] right
[1:16:33] now if he's so pure why'd you have to
[1:16:34] make one far
[1:16:37] and only been Cain the way that
[1:16:39] everybody's treaches it
[1:16:41] but you see
[1:16:43] organized religion has been from the
[1:16:45] garden
[1:16:48] and even though the new birth
[1:16:52] can kill that old nature of being that
[1:16:56] we are
[1:16:58] the soul part
[1:17:00] and God can come in and live
[1:17:07] and as I told you when it first started
[1:17:08] kind of known this I said everybody
[1:17:10] wants to take the new birth and then
[1:17:12] they want to go to a marriage and
[1:17:14] divorce go to we get these bodies free
[1:17:15] we're ready to go
[1:17:18] well now if you if you followed my
[1:17:20] lineup
[1:17:22] the way I believe it you work it first
[1:17:26] then you can deal with your natural life
[1:17:30] but there's still that life stage to be
[1:17:32] dealt with and that's what's killing us
[1:17:36] is the organizational spirit that dwells
[1:17:40] through us
[1:17:44] and if that old husband ain't dead
[1:17:49] we're still married to organize religion
[1:17:51] whether you like it or not
[1:17:53] that's what your Prophet said I've got
[1:17:55] it in here in invisible Union you read
[1:17:56] the book you've heard it
[1:17:59] he said there ain't no denomination
[1:18:04] can take the word
[1:18:08] now we I'll say it again over and over
[1:18:10] we're not against people
[1:18:13] no difference in them you remember I
[1:18:15] read you a quote the other day said
[1:18:16] their church is this the church not your
[1:18:18] church is a church it's a building you
[1:18:20] know
[1:18:21] we may not have the fanciest in the
[1:18:23] country but we do have a building you
[1:18:25] know and I'm happy with it
[1:18:32] but listen
[1:18:34] that old husband
[1:18:37] organized religion
[1:18:39] is what's caused in our problem
[1:18:46] and I've made the statement before and
[1:18:48] might as well go ahead and make it now
[1:18:49] and then you can do what you want to on
[1:18:51] especially internets and sister
[1:18:52] thanks
[1:18:53] see your prophet
[1:18:57] came through organized religion no no
[1:18:59] wait a minute no profit I'll agree with
[1:19:01] you 100 on that well that no Prophet
[1:19:05] ever come to an organization or from an
[1:19:07] organization he said
[1:19:09] I'll agree with you 100 percent
[1:19:12] because the prophet is the Lord Jesus
[1:19:15] Christ
[1:19:17] you can't organize him
[1:19:21] so then when the prophet seen it
[1:19:24] he saw in the opening of the seals he
[1:19:27] said for one time in my life
[1:19:32] I see why I was against
[1:19:35] denomination of sometimes
[1:19:37] why it took the opening of the word for
[1:19:41] him to realize what was really killing
[1:19:44] us
[1:19:47] what did we read while ago Satan
[1:19:50] explaining it away
[1:19:59] yeah I'm up here preaching away and
[1:20:00] you're out there figuring it out
[1:20:08] well I don't quite agree with all what
[1:20:10] he said this and I just don't I think
[1:20:11] it's this way I think it's that way
[1:20:15] yeah
[1:20:16] kind of like we had two brothers and a
[1:20:17] Minister's meeting one time and they
[1:20:19] were just going at each other so and
[1:20:21] they were just raising King I finally
[1:20:22] just stopped him I said holy this to me
[1:20:24] I said are you saying so and he said
[1:20:26] yeah you're saying so yeah I said
[1:20:27] everybody in the building knows you're
[1:20:29] saying the same thing but you too
[1:20:33] both of you so stubborn you won't admit
[1:20:37] if you're saying the same thing
[1:20:40] all right
[1:20:43] you see Church
[1:20:45] that old husband of organized religion
[1:20:49] is what's holding you and I here
[1:20:52] now
[1:20:54] some of you amen back a few Services ago
[1:20:58] when I brought it around Horeb
[1:21:01] and said we went around horrible long
[1:21:03] enough
[1:21:04] you know
[1:21:05] talking about the message people
[1:21:08] in the doctrines of organization that's
[1:21:10] among the message
[1:21:12] well I'm not preaching out there
[1:21:15] I'm preaching here what's wrong with
[1:21:18] Lula is organizational religion
[1:21:24] and that husband the prophet said
[1:21:26] invisible Union has got to be dead
[1:21:30] right
[1:21:31] let's see if I can pick that one up
[1:21:36] he speaks to you've got to be born again
[1:21:37] to find out
[1:21:42] all right go to number 11.
[1:21:46] do the number 11.
[1:21:49] invisible Union
[1:21:51] and to be married to the second Adam
[1:21:54] Christ the word
[1:21:58] you must separate yourself by Death from
[1:22:02] your first denominational husband
[1:22:06] well brother Dale he just using
[1:22:09] denominations as as a way of explaining
[1:22:13] the husband
[1:22:14] oh I'm glad you thought of that
[1:22:19] because there isn't one of them that can
[1:22:22] take all the word of God
[1:22:24] so he's not talking about just some
[1:22:27] explaining it
[1:22:31] he's explaining what we are
[1:22:35] whole makeup is organizational
[1:22:42] right
[1:22:43] car dealer
[1:22:45] right
[1:22:48] I don't I don't know what
[1:22:50] uh
[1:22:51] Richard's selling now but used to sell
[1:22:53] insurance
[1:22:55] sister Johnny was in computer with
[1:22:58] chiltons or something
[1:23:00] and what it was
[1:23:03] Aaron is working on down at the
[1:23:05] University of Georgia
[1:23:08] everywhere you had is an organization
[1:23:11] right
[1:23:12] what is an organization
[1:23:15] a group of people getting together for a
[1:23:18] common cause to try to produce a product
[1:23:21] to sell it
[1:23:22] that's in the natural
[1:23:25] right
[1:23:27] bring that over into spiritual
[1:23:30] then you'll see why there's so many
[1:23:31] people in this message that they're
[1:23:33] following all kind of doctrinal ideas
[1:23:35] and they'll ask you real quick who do
[1:23:38] you follow
[1:23:40] Heaven Help for you to say Samuel Dale
[1:23:44] because I'll be the first one to tell
[1:23:46] you you're wrong
[1:23:49] because you can organize on that and die
[1:23:51] just as quick doing it that way as you
[1:23:54] can to believe a two Soul seventh under
[1:23:55] virtue perusia or polygamy
[1:24:01] I fought that from the beginning don't
[1:24:03] do it
[1:24:04] except what God gives us and thank God
[1:24:07] for it
[1:24:10] but don't organize around it don't come
[1:24:11] to me won't know what kind of cars could
[1:24:13] you buy
[1:24:15] I'll tell you a Chevrolet
[1:24:19] you know why
[1:24:21] my check comes from there
[1:24:25] I get a retirement check in General
[1:24:27] Motors
[1:24:29] come on Church
[1:24:33] that old near first denominational
[1:24:35] husband
[1:24:39] he's got to be dead
[1:24:43] to yourself from your first
[1:24:44] denominational husband because there
[1:24:46] isn't one of them that can take all the
[1:24:47] word of God to show me where the one is
[1:24:49] at oh you say mine the other Feller says
[1:24:52] he is to put them together
[1:24:57] put them together and you find out
[1:25:00] you're both wrong
[1:25:02] now watch
[1:25:04] soon as you denominate
[1:25:07] read revelation 17.
[1:25:13] now come on watch revelation 17.
[1:25:16] the old mother and the Harlot
[1:25:18] daughters
[1:25:19] right
[1:25:21] right see if you think your church is
[1:25:23] this or that just read the Holy he says
[1:25:26] they're both wrong as soon as you
[1:25:27] denominate read Revelation 17. you see
[1:25:30] you've got to be dead from that thing
[1:25:33] and I'm not speaking to this local
[1:25:34] assembly I'm speaking
[1:25:36] all together Across the Nation you must
[1:25:39] be dead to your first husband if you're
[1:25:42] United to Christ and still married to a
[1:25:44] denomination
[1:25:46] you're an adulteress
[1:25:48] you are what
[1:25:51] lady osia
[1:25:55] we've got to be birthed out of Lady of
[1:25:58] SIA into the message of the hour
[1:26:03] there has never been
[1:26:05] and never will be a part of the body of
[1:26:08] Christ that is a denomination
[1:26:12] he said no wait a minute they had their
[1:26:13] they had their day but there wasn't no
[1:26:15] denomination out of it
[1:26:17] it was not a denomination in the days of
[1:26:19] Luther Luther was called out to be the
[1:26:21] people
[1:26:23] they denominated after he got gone right
[1:26:27] every organization formed after their
[1:26:30] leader preached his message then they
[1:26:33] started as quick as this Prophet went
[1:26:35] off the scene to organize and denominate
[1:26:38] this message
[1:26:44] and like the prophet said you're arguing
[1:26:46] over whether he's coming on a white
[1:26:48] horse
[1:26:49] or on a cloud he said either way he's
[1:26:51] coming I want to be ready
[1:26:54] what about a man like that
[1:26:58] but yet until those seals broke to the
[1:27:01] prophet he had the white horse rider
[1:27:04] as the Holy Spirit
[1:27:08] so he was deceived
[1:27:11] oh that'll go over good won't it he was
[1:27:14] deceived by
[1:27:15] modernization just like John was
[1:27:18] went on Patmos he admired that church
[1:27:22] read your Bible
[1:27:24] read what the prophet has to say
[1:27:27] he admired the church
[1:27:30] beautiful situation you look at it
[1:27:32] across the land out there today
[1:27:34] there's churches today that are spending
[1:27:36] all of their day taking up money going
[1:27:38] to Foreign Fields feeding the poor doing
[1:27:41] all kind of things right come on
[1:27:43] are you against that no
[1:27:49] what am I against then
[1:27:51] what's killing me and you
[1:27:55] now if you're listening listen very
[1:27:57] carefully
[1:28:01] even the garden organized
[1:28:04] started to death
[1:28:06] until we get rid of her problem
[1:28:11] and her problem wasn't uh
[1:28:15] a woman that was
[1:28:17] so
[1:28:20] sexy
[1:28:25] that wasn't her problem
[1:28:29] right
[1:28:31] what was her problem
[1:28:34] she wanted to help God
[1:28:40] now can you see what I was talking about
[1:28:41] the children of Israel does feel like
[1:28:43] the Nations around us
[1:28:46] they wanted to help God
[1:28:48] something they could do
[1:28:53] Eve couldn't accept the fact that it's
[1:28:54] just happy and be in the garden and God
[1:28:57] would come every day and lay them down
[1:28:58] at night and put him to sleep
[1:29:00] and say have you enjoyed today
[1:29:06] Drew her
[1:29:08] memory reason conscious affections
[1:29:12] whatever REM you want to call it
[1:29:18] through that realms
[1:29:20] Satan began to
[1:29:24] interpret
[1:29:26] explain it
[1:29:29] laughs
[1:29:31] and she began to accept his lie
[1:29:36] was the secondary attribute from that
[1:29:40] he had to First enter her mind and
[1:29:42] that's what Paul said lest Satan through
[1:29:45] his septility like he did even the
[1:29:47] garden
[1:29:47] through the Simplicity that is in Christ
[1:29:49] Jesus
[1:29:53] you come over here in the end time this
[1:29:55] is the worst age of all ages
[1:29:59] there's never been age like this
[1:30:04] organized religion has brought the
[1:30:06] people together
[1:30:12] and you and I could sit right here in
[1:30:13] Lula and do the same thing
[1:30:17] we can be a two Soul seven Thunder
[1:30:19] versus whatever you want to call them
[1:30:21] doctrines
[1:30:27] we got a choice
[1:30:32] God gave us Grace
[1:30:35] now that's what I want to talk about a
[1:30:36] minute and then we'll just quit
[1:30:39] he gave us Grace by bringing this
[1:30:42] message
[1:30:44] this message is not a book of rules
[1:30:49] I was talking internet
[1:30:51] Sunday school class today
[1:30:54] they asked brother random one day what
[1:30:56] must we do to be saved he said you know
[1:30:59] for a lot of people said uh you know he
[1:31:01] said they asked them during the Bible
[1:31:03] what can we do but he said to most
[1:31:06] people today said we'd said quit this
[1:31:08] and don't do that and don't do that you
[1:31:10] know cut don't cut your hair no more
[1:31:11] don't wear them don't paint your face
[1:31:13] and don't do all this don't drink don't
[1:31:14] go he said they didn't ask him that
[1:31:17] they said they asked him how to get born
[1:31:19] again
[1:31:20] did we give them a book of rules
[1:31:23] now come on Church be honest
[1:31:26] show me a church that don't base things
[1:31:28] on rules
[1:31:35] come on
[1:31:37] well brother now the church got to have
[1:31:39] rules I agree
[1:31:45] but if they're
[1:31:46] organizational rules
[1:31:48] there's a lot of difference in that in
[1:31:50] God's word to be plain
[1:31:54] because you can make an organizational
[1:31:56] rule out or don't cut your heart don't
[1:31:57] worry your pants don't paint your face
[1:32:00] right and you can tell the people that
[1:32:02] are on the way they
[1:32:06] but that's not the question what must we
[1:32:08] do to be saved
[1:32:09] repeat every one of them be baptized in
[1:32:11] the name of Jesus Christ
[1:32:17] organize it
[1:32:24] that old denominational husband
[1:32:27] has got to be dead
[1:32:32] as long as you whole we read to you to
[1:32:34] man's traditional tradition of
[1:32:37] denominations you're called in the word
[1:32:39] God's word
[1:32:42] adulteress
[1:32:43] as long as you're a denominational Creed
[1:32:46] seeking Seeker belonging to a
[1:32:48] denominational church that denies a word
[1:32:51] you're an adulteress
[1:32:54] that's what the Bible said
[1:33:03] are you down to number 11. burger at
[1:33:05] 158.
[1:33:10] back up to 11.
[1:33:13] 158 I'm right there
[1:33:15] neither can you buy our sons of God
[1:33:19] neither came by our godson of his word
[1:33:21] to this illegitimate denominational
[1:33:23] group
[1:33:25] you cannot do it in your incubator you
[1:33:27] cannot bring forth a word Son of God I
[1:33:31] am speaking to the church but still you
[1:33:33] claim to be very religious so was kind
[1:33:35] The Prostitute of son very religious
[1:33:38] Bill dollars offered sacrifice paid his
[1:33:41] tithes and done everything that any
[1:33:43] other religious man would be would do
[1:33:45] would he fail to keep the word he failed
[1:33:49] to have the Revelation go ahead and roll
[1:33:51] it up
[1:33:52] and the Revelation is the only thing the
[1:33:56] revelation of the word what is it what
[1:33:58] is a revelation Jesus said Upon This
[1:34:00] Rock I'll build my church
[1:34:01] in the gates of hell can't Prevail
[1:34:03] against it faith is a revelation because
[1:34:05] faith has been revealed Abel by faith
[1:34:08] offered by Revelation Faith offered to
[1:34:10] God a more excellent sacrifice than that
[1:34:12] of Cain
[1:34:14] by revelation
[1:34:16] Revelation is the only thing that's
[1:34:18] going to let you and I know that we're a
[1:34:20] denominational Creed seeking bunch of
[1:34:22] people
[1:34:29] but brother Dale I want to meet you in
[1:34:31] the office called I want you to know
[1:34:33] I don't think no Creeds girl
[1:34:42] look at number 12.
[1:34:48] I ended up the other night talking about
[1:34:49] the eagle
[1:34:51] look at paragraph 120
[1:34:57] 128.
[1:35:00] ends 127 you mean to tell me that an
[1:35:03] eagle would eat that
[1:35:04] you couldn't do it no sir neither will a
[1:35:07] Christian eat on that dead akarians
[1:35:10] from our old denominational from old
[1:35:12] denominational doctrines and things they
[1:35:14] want the word of God fresh
[1:35:16] the promise of the hour
[1:35:19] God promises rabbits in the days of
[1:35:22] Luther he promised other things in the
[1:35:25] days of others but now he promised us a
[1:35:28] full Square meal
[1:35:30] and the full seven course meal for all
[1:35:33] the Seven Seals are open and everything
[1:35:36] is ready for the word of God to those
[1:35:39] who can receive
[1:35:45] pray for me because on The Minister's
[1:35:48] meeting I've got to speak on the seventh
[1:35:50] seal
[1:35:55] and how can you speak to people about a
[1:35:57] seventh seal
[1:35:58] when automatically before we ever start
[1:36:00] the argument's going to be whether the
[1:36:02] seal is open or whether it's not
[1:36:09] you say what causes that
[1:36:12] preachers explaining away the word
[1:36:19] see you say well what about them anybody
[1:36:22] can read the Bible says the seventh seal
[1:36:24] was opened that's right but you go
[1:36:27] explain that to the people of this
[1:36:28] message
[1:36:31] they'll quote you to death
[1:36:40] but look at the last one and then we'll
[1:36:42] get through
[1:36:44] look as he finishes up the invisible
[1:36:46] Union and what he's saying
[1:36:49] paragraph 305 307 I think
[1:36:53] saying this now this goes across the
[1:36:56] nation in New York now it's 25 minutes
[1:36:58] after 11. well Philadelphia around
[1:37:01] through there
[1:37:02] your Saints sitting there listening
[1:37:04] right now in churches all around lay up
[1:37:07] way down and around Mexico way up around
[1:37:09] the Canada reading this is to show you
[1:37:12] where it's all over the world and all
[1:37:14] around the cross 200 miles anywhere
[1:37:17] within the North American continent here
[1:37:19] almost people
[1:37:21] is added listening right now thousands
[1:37:25] of thousands listening
[1:37:30] that's my message to you Church
[1:37:38] you that's a union
[1:37:43] that's an organization oh that's an
[1:37:44] organism
[1:37:48] right
[1:37:49] do you Church bride right
[1:37:53] knew this a union
[1:37:55] organism spiritual union by the word
[1:37:59] and that you're dead to these old
[1:38:01] husbands
[1:38:04] you're born to new
[1:38:06] don't try to dig him up he's dead
[1:38:09] and if you're a born-again Christian
[1:38:10] that little germ that was predestinated
[1:38:13] to you is word coming on word on word on
[1:38:16] word on word and coming to full stature
[1:38:20] of
[1:38:21] Christ that's right so we can come to
[1:38:24] get his bride now we're just ready for
[1:38:26] that one thing that's the coming of the
[1:38:28] Lord
[1:38:33] denominations
[1:38:37] old husbands
[1:38:40] you go home and you run in organization
[1:38:42] in your computer you run in
[1:38:44] denominations and just read
[1:38:47] I've just picked a few just to
[1:38:51] make a point
[1:38:56] organized religion was used even to
[1:38:58] bring us to Christ
[1:39:00] Paul calls it a Schoolmaster
[1:39:03] because of all that
[1:39:05] but a random cause of denominations a
[1:39:08] Schoolmaster
[1:39:09] to bring us to Christ
[1:39:11] all right
[1:39:13] we've been called out of organized
[1:39:16] religion
[1:39:18] right
[1:39:19] into the message of the hour
[1:39:21] because that's the only ones that will
[1:39:23] receive the message of the hour
[1:39:26] but we've got to have a birth from word
[1:39:28] upon word upon
[1:39:29] kind of looks like he's talking about
[1:39:31] the Statue of perfect man don't it
[1:39:33] word upon word upon word
[1:39:38] to set us free from organized religion
[1:39:43] I said it the first day I was in
[1:39:45] Gainesville
[1:39:46] years ago when we left the Baptist
[1:39:50] I said God's got me out of the Baptist
[1:39:53] now I want the Baptist out of me
[1:40:01] organization is man's ideas
[1:40:04] I tried to make my point about using it
[1:40:07] as Paul does with the law
[1:40:11] see there's more laws than just 10 of
[1:40:13] The Commandments
[1:40:15] you can't even take the Ten Commandments
[1:40:17] as a brother was saying this morning and
[1:40:19] even deal with it as uh our doings
[1:40:24] because the law was spiritual Paul says
[1:40:28] it was the word of God
[1:40:32] what man done with it by explaining it
[1:40:35] away
[1:40:38] made to people more lost
[1:40:41] than there ever were to start with
[1:40:47] now listen you know how I am and the way
[1:40:49] I talk
[1:40:53] I thanked every preacher that's ever
[1:40:55] helped me
[1:40:56] when I was back there in the
[1:40:57] denominations and things we was going
[1:40:59] through them real fast sometimes one of
[1:41:01] the last three months we kind of
[1:41:03] shuffled them around a good bit
[1:41:05] you know
[1:41:07] I thanked them all
[1:41:09] for helping me
[1:41:12] I had to walk out of two churches in
[1:41:14] this message
[1:41:17] I personally thank both of the pastors
[1:41:19] for helping me
[1:41:24] I thank God for people that's helped me
[1:41:25] and wanted to do for me
[1:41:29] but we didn't realize the danger of
[1:41:32] everything
[1:41:36] you see you take those little children
[1:41:37] and you put them in a Sunday school
[1:41:39] class and you
[1:41:41] you
[1:41:43] say we will sing about Jesus
[1:41:46] what are you saying
[1:41:49] they said Trinity father son Oliver
[1:41:56] what did the denominations teach us
[1:42:02] they used to tell me as a deacon and if
[1:42:05] the preacher got off the word I was
[1:42:07] supposed to go to the pulpit
[1:42:09] close his Bible
[1:42:11] dismiss the congregation and we'd put
[1:42:14] him out of the church
[1:42:17] I said all I know the Bible said it's
[1:42:18] supposed to wait on tables
[1:42:22] I didn't get along then either
[1:42:25] I was too independent I guess
[1:42:29] because I told him I said I don't see it
[1:42:31] in the word
[1:42:34] you see in the Baptist the deacons run
[1:42:36] the church
[1:42:38] that's that's the way it is
[1:42:40] then you move up to some of these others
[1:42:42] and they're called other things you know
[1:42:45] but listen
[1:42:47] God has led you and I to the truth
[1:42:50] there is no making fun or lighter or
[1:42:53] thrown off on anybody that's tried to
[1:42:55] help us bring it to where we are
[1:43:00] that's not the way bless God I don't
[1:43:02] know how to do them an organized
[1:43:03] religion I've always told you
[1:43:05] you introduce somebody to the message
[1:43:07] and they start talking about organized
[1:43:09] religion being wrong you watch that
[1:43:11] person
[1:43:14] 99.9.9 of the time three months later
[1:43:17] they're gone
[1:43:21] because they're going to find something
[1:43:23] wrong where are they coming to
[1:43:27] but if you get them stationed in the
[1:43:29] word of the one true and living God
[1:43:33] the water baptism
[1:43:35] the things of the Bible of the truth
[1:43:38] a lot of them will stay
[1:43:41] what do you give the first thing a
[1:43:43] church H book
[1:43:47] right
[1:43:48] that's the first thing I give to anybody
[1:43:49] that's a new convert and I don't give
[1:43:51] these people sitting here to tell you
[1:43:53] that I worked with them for months
[1:43:55] before I mentioned brother random was a
[1:43:57] prophet
[1:43:59] they asked me where I got it never told
[1:44:01] them
[1:44:04] why
[1:44:09] because it wasn't getting them to just a
[1:44:11] doctrinal quote
[1:44:15] just trying to get him to Jesus Christ
[1:44:20] you go back in your mind and you think
[1:44:22] it over the people that you know
[1:44:24] preachers and all they got in the
[1:44:25] pulpits and screamed and hollered how
[1:44:28] bad organized religion was
[1:44:32] and you know yourself most of them are
[1:44:34] not in the message today
[1:44:40] if they are they're still preaching
[1:44:41] about organized religion how bad it is
[1:44:44] that's all right
[1:44:49] but you see the more that's being
[1:44:51] revealed to me the more I find out
[1:44:56] I'm the guy
[1:45:01] that Jesus said
[1:45:05] was standing in the door
[1:45:10] and wouldn't let the people go in
[1:45:14] and wouldn't go any South you remember
[1:45:16] that
[1:45:18] you know he's talking about preachers
[1:45:21] preachers standing in the door
[1:45:25] wouldn't go in and wouldn't let the
[1:45:27] people go in
[1:45:30] right he said hold that left it's all
[1:45:31] back there
[1:45:33] and Spirits ain't dead
[1:45:37] I know what I got to preach on the next
[1:45:39] one you know that brother random said
[1:45:40] the Holy Ghost is being Bound 2
[1:45:44] 000 years
[1:45:49] it's only been 2000 since Calvary
[1:45:56] so evidently never was loose to what he
[1:45:58] wanted to be
[1:46:00] Paul was fighting it he will come back
[1:46:07] it's what your Prophet says it's been
[1:46:09] bound for two thousand years at the door
[1:46:12] of Creeds and
[1:46:14] you either said dogmas or denominations
[1:46:18] they got them lay in their home
[1:46:23] you say well I'm out I'm out well praise
[1:46:26] God
[1:46:28] I want him to get me out
[1:46:36] I like that song about what is it each
[1:46:38] step I take
[1:46:40] just leads me closer
[1:46:44] right
[1:46:45] come on brothers let's sing that
[1:46:47] there's no need of trying to preach a
[1:46:49] whole lot and read a lot of quotes
[1:46:51] if you don't see what I'm talking about
[1:46:53] you're in bad shape
[1:46:57] denominations still have you and I bound
[1:47:00] limitations
[1:47:02] well we're not perfect now
[1:47:06] are you trying to say you're perfect
[1:47:09] are you trying to say you're the only
[1:47:11] ones going
[1:47:15] we will all be good
[1:47:19] right
[1:47:21] or I'll be good and just love one
[1:47:23] another it don't matter what the brother
[1:47:26] believes or the sister just just love
[1:47:29] them well I thought we're supposed to do
[1:47:30] that anyway
[1:47:34] I thought the Bible spoke of a Christian
[1:47:36] loving everybody
[1:47:42] have you ever seen me get upset and mad
[1:47:44] in front of somebody that was trying to
[1:47:46] talk to him about the Lord
[1:47:48] some of these are here that I introduced
[1:47:50] a message to
[1:47:52] ask him
[1:47:56] sister Johnny back there her brother
[1:47:58] brother dardy he got all mixed up in an
[1:48:01] old
[1:48:02] religious cult
[1:48:03] up at Lula Georgia
[1:48:06] boy
[1:48:07] she flew all the way from New York
[1:48:11] to come down
[1:48:15] and try to get her brother out of that
[1:48:17] old denominational cult
[1:48:21] not trying to say anything but just
[1:48:23] comparing it
[1:48:25] you remember Welch Evans and them it was
[1:48:27] going straight and brought around him
[1:48:28] out
[1:48:31] you remember that
[1:48:32] and when they come down to straighten
[1:48:34] him out every one of them got converted
[1:48:37] well sister Johnny comes down to see us
[1:48:41] all
[1:48:42] to see what we was
[1:48:44] she was going to straighten us all out
[1:48:49] well she said they made a good thing had
[1:48:51] a good service and good spirit good
[1:48:54] talkings you know good preaching and
[1:49:02] what caught her heart
[1:49:07] not all we talked about
[1:49:09] not all we could convince are in the
[1:49:11] Bible of the prophet
[1:49:13] she'd heard all of that
[1:49:16] right
[1:49:18] but there was a little old girl about
[1:49:20] probably might have been eight years old
[1:49:22] or something I don't remember exactly
[1:49:24] it's a little young girl
[1:49:27] her name was Anna
[1:49:31] sister Johnny was leaving that day and
[1:49:33] everybody was telling him bye and she
[1:49:35] said well that's good called him old
[1:49:37] folks they know how to be be nice
[1:49:40] you know they deceive you
[1:49:42] you know they make you feel like he's
[1:49:44] being nice to you
[1:49:46] but when Anna went out there and said
[1:49:48] sister Johnny we enjoyed having you
[1:49:51] glad you came and I love you
[1:49:54] Glad You Came Down
[1:49:57] ask her what
[1:50:00] brought God to her
[1:50:04] it's not all that hoopaloo
[1:50:09] she said them old folks can deceive you
[1:50:12] but said them young ones won't
[1:50:16] they'll tell you like it is
[1:50:20] is it not that the prophet said a life
[1:50:22] lived is the best thing for anywhere
[1:50:27] a life lived
[1:50:30] wins more people to Jesus Christ than
[1:50:32] everything else
[1:50:35] brother I don't like it because you do
[1:50:37] this or you do that
[1:50:41] all right you're not the pastor
[1:50:44] and a sister sit here and played the
[1:50:45] piano for 17 years with us I'm probably
[1:50:48] 10 out of that she's smoking
[1:50:53] I didn't throw her out of the church
[1:50:55] ain't nobody get on my platform like
[1:50:58] that that's your church
[1:51:01] I had
[1:51:06] would you see church I have to remember
[1:51:08] where I come from
[1:51:11] and I can still remember where I come
[1:51:13] from
[1:51:16] and that's why I Don't Preach like all
[1:51:18] these other preachers
[1:51:21] I only try to preach the word to you
[1:51:24] because all of this other
[1:51:27] of lives and things
[1:51:29] if I can get you born again it'll take
[1:51:31] care of it
[1:51:33] you know what in your house
[1:51:36] you'll be wanted and one day you're
[1:51:38] looking boy look at that look look at
[1:51:40] people away how can brother Dale let
[1:51:41] them women come in here looking like
[1:51:43] that now folks out there on the internet
[1:51:45] I mean you Joe you're welcome to turn
[1:51:47] around and show the people here there's
[1:51:49] not a bunch of bobbed hired women and
[1:51:51] shorts wearing and stuff like that we do
[1:51:54] have rules and regulations
[1:51:56] they're not rules and regulations
[1:51:58] they're just the fact that we've had
[1:52:00] people come here and once they see the
[1:52:02] ladies here and the way they dress they
[1:52:04] just start dressing that away
[1:52:08] it's not to been preached to
[1:52:11] they just see it
[1:52:17] it's the organized religions what's
[1:52:19] killing us
[1:52:21] an organized religion is that old
[1:52:23] husband now you want me to finish at
[1:52:24] this point
[1:52:26] any thoughts we have let's tie all three
[1:52:29] messages together one second
[1:52:31] the new birth marital situations of life
[1:52:34] are
[1:52:36] your old denominational husband
[1:52:40] tied together with one thing
[1:52:42] the law
[1:52:44] what is the law brother Dale
[1:52:47] you've preached on it now for 27 sermons
[1:52:50] give us your thoughts on what the law is
[1:52:53] the law is not just the Ten Commandments
[1:52:57] Paul said the Lord Spirit of Life sent
[1:52:59] me free law sin and death there's many
[1:53:01] laws
[1:53:02] law is man's ideas
[1:53:08] that he has acquired over time
[1:53:15] right
[1:53:17] well the how I was telling the other day
[1:53:18] when we're up there fishing
[1:53:22] about a time when a
[1:53:25] tank was burning Underground
[1:53:28] well I'm going to run
[1:53:32] he told everybody else they better leave
[1:53:36] but he knew one law
[1:53:39] and that was if he could cut that iron
[1:53:41] off
[1:53:43] but he knew by cutting that air off if
[1:53:45] that thing caused a spark after then
[1:53:47] it's going to blow up and he is gone
[1:53:50] but he runs over with a rag and his
[1:53:52] mother's out to pipe
[1:53:54] it was burning
[1:53:59] and he stopped that from happening
[1:54:02] willing to give his life
[1:54:04] to save others
[1:54:07] laws are man's ideas
[1:54:13] right speed limit this that doing that
[1:54:15] through and you know what you got to do
[1:54:17] you're buying homes you got a law you
[1:54:18] got to go buy a way to buy them you
[1:54:19] gotta
[1:54:21] law is man's ideas
[1:54:25] so they didn't get what they thought
[1:54:28] they thought they got a buck a bunch of
[1:54:30] rules you know no they got God in letter
[1:54:33] form
[1:54:34] now how can you make that wrong
[1:54:37] I've never in all of preached in my life
[1:54:39] tried to make the law wrong I've told
[1:54:41] you the law is spiritual
[1:54:43] the man's ideas on the law to interpret
[1:54:46] it
[1:54:50] see they didn't listen
[1:54:52] you want brother Brown's words
[1:54:55] he said God wrote
[1:54:58] now he ain't talking about just Ten
[1:55:00] Commandments he's talking about all of
[1:55:03] the ordinances and the things that was
[1:55:05] written in Genesis Exodus Leviticus
[1:55:07] Numbers Deuteronomy written by Moses
[1:55:12] he said God wrote
[1:55:15] Moses interpreted
[1:55:22] that's why he was Christ to the people
[1:55:25] God wrote and brother Branham
[1:55:27] interpreted
[1:55:34] law is man's ideas
[1:55:39] the word of God is Not man's idea
[1:55:42] the word of God is God's word
[1:55:46] so now you take the Ten Commandments and
[1:55:48] make them wrong
[1:55:49] his brother Gary was saying one time
[1:55:51] about it
[1:55:52] you read it a little different you know
[1:55:55] you heard the story of the guy that was
[1:55:57] overseas and his wife kept writing him
[1:55:58] you know writing to him and he couldn't
[1:56:00] read he got somebody else to read it and
[1:56:02] he's
[1:56:02] he kept reading her letters every time
[1:56:04] and she'd say
[1:56:05] we need money send home money
[1:56:09] we got bills to pay
[1:56:14] well you just wouldn't do it
[1:56:17] and one day he had another guy that
[1:56:19] letter you know
[1:56:21] that would you just read that again to
[1:56:23] me look what she says
[1:56:25] the man says
[1:56:28] we're hungry
[1:56:30] we need something to eat we need food
[1:56:34] did we need to pay the bills
[1:56:39] he said I'll tell you what
[1:56:42] since she's changed her mind I'm going
[1:56:45] to send her some money
[1:56:48] let's see if we'd ever take that amount
[1:56:50] in the word of God
[1:56:52] and brother Gary my point was Brother
[1:56:54] Gary said he was here talking about and
[1:56:57] you read it I shall not kill
[1:57:00] we'll read it Thou shalt not kill
[1:57:05] is anything wrong with it
[1:57:07] Thou shalt not steal
[1:57:10] oh we want this deep hard Stern boss God
[1:57:14] help not kill us
[1:57:17] then he turned around and says go out
[1:57:19] there and kill all them people and don't
[1:57:20] even leave babies alive
[1:57:23] well he looked like he's done broke his
[1:57:25] own word
[1:57:26] no
[1:57:30] but you change it to Thou shalt not kill
[1:57:33] that's your not steal
[1:57:35] if you're a Christian you're not going
[1:57:37] to steal you're a Christian you're not
[1:57:39] going to kill
[1:57:41] if you're a Christian you're not going
[1:57:42] to commit adultery
[1:57:44] you're not going to lie cheat and steal
[1:57:46] if you're Christian right
[1:57:49] there's nothing wrong with the
[1:57:50] Commandments
[1:57:55] the Lord not God is one
[1:57:58] is any problem with that
[1:58:04] you'll have no other gods before me
[1:58:06] is any problem with that
[1:58:10] totally changes what we think the Ten
[1:58:12] Commandments says to be a book of rules
[1:58:15] it turns into a revelation of Jesus
[1:58:17] Christ
[1:58:19] you know what Jesus was when he walked
[1:58:20] out there
[1:58:22] you know that the word the Bible was
[1:58:25] written by the prophets is that right
[1:58:28] and you know what he was a fulfillment
[1:58:30] of that
[1:58:32] was that laws and rules and regulations
[1:58:35] or was it a person
[1:58:41] a lot of things different people think
[1:58:42] about it but I hope you understand what
[1:58:44] I've tried to drive down
[1:58:45] trying to get down to this point but
[1:58:47] really I should probably spend 20
[1:58:48] sermons on this and I may do it because
[1:58:50] I don't know I just I don't know what
[1:58:53] I'm going to preach on now
[1:58:55] I know a few things but
[1:58:57] my point is one thing
[1:59:00] You and I by our own understanding is
[1:59:04] what's taking us to the Grave
[1:59:10] we have heard the word we've marched
[1:59:12] around Horeb
[1:59:14] but it's now time to move on
[1:59:19] and to see Christ what do we cover
[1:59:22] let's Stand Together
[1:59:38] Christ is
[1:59:39] what we need to see the revealed word
[1:59:58] each step I take
[2:00:01] to know that he will die
[2:00:07] you're right anybody have a need
[2:00:12] to know that God is a person
[2:00:18] he's a person
[2:00:20] he's been explained away to us that he's
[2:00:23] just a spirit
[2:00:28] my little sister has a hurting in her
[2:00:31] back to what you're back
[2:00:33] Mighty young will be having back trouble
[2:00:36] all right I want you to do two things
[2:00:40] I'm gonna pray for you
[2:00:43] don't you take this home with you
[2:00:46] and pin it to your pillow you know not
[2:00:48] to fill a case because you take it off
[2:00:50] worse get it to the pillar or the bed
[2:00:52] and the mattress you know your mom will
[2:00:55] take care of it pin it on the bed so
[2:00:58] that'll be for that but we're going to
[2:01:01] believe father
[2:01:04] our sisters Mighty young will be having
[2:01:05] a hurting in her body
[2:01:08] oh Lord
[2:01:18] just reached out and touch our little
[2:01:20] sister
[2:01:21] take away this problem
[2:01:25] in the name of Jesus Christ
