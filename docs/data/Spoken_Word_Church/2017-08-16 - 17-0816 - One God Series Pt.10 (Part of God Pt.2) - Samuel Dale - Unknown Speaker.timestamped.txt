[3:55] John 1c we're going to finally get to
[4:01] verse 3 where he's the creator but it'll
[4:03] be a few more messages just hold on a
[4:06] while okay says in the beginning was the
[4:09] word and the Word was with God in the
[4:10] Word was God
[4:11] the same was in the beginning with God
[4:14] all things were made by him and without
[4:18] him was not anything made that was made
[4:20] in him was life and the life was a lot
[4:25] of men a lot shyness and darkness and
[4:28] the darkness comprehended it not alright
[4:31] we go to Colossians to pick her a
[4:33] thought for tonight
[4:34] Colossians 2 verse 8
[4:39] beware less men's bands for you through
[4:42] philosophy and vain deceit after the
[4:46] tradition of men after the rudiments of
[4:48] the world and not after Christ all right
[4:50] because we don't we're going if we keep
[4:53] it all into Christ then we'll come out
[4:54] to verse 9 for in him dwelleth all the
[4:57] fullness of the Godhead bodily and ye
[5:01] are complete in him which is the head of
[5:04] all principality and power you may be
[5:08] seated the Lord added blessing to the
[5:10] reading of the word now I hope that you
[5:16] remember this make this little statement
[5:20] before we start on the message you
[5:22] remember about two months ago I made the
[5:26] statement that I believe that we were in
[5:31] the end time and in time for the bride
[5:33] to recognize who she is
[5:35] and the Prophet was saying you know when
[5:38] she realized who she is then all to be
[5:42] over with it'll be going out and we're
[5:43] doing all right and I told you I said
[5:45] the brothers here are really picking up
[5:47] to minister and I said the ministers are
[5:50] coming in from the foreign fields to
[5:52] minister and cush what we had for
[5:55] trees represented and we had five
[5:57] preachers well I believe each one of
[6:00] them picked up a good thought carried on
[6:02] the thought of doing I believe it was
[6:04] the Lord that led them to to speak and
[6:07] then brother Brady finishing it all up
[6:10] because see brother Brady would have
[6:12] brought it into the testimony on the
[6:15] morning service of how that go to random
[6:19] went to the Olive there and you know in
[6:23] Jamaica and the things that had happened
[6:25] later in a different thing but the thing
[6:27] that happened about his wife where
[6:30] brother Branham called him out in the
[6:31] service and said you know your wife will
[6:33] be okay all right that to me is what we
[6:36] call a living witness and I'm glad the
[6:38] Bible speaks plainly of saying that
[6:41] there's you know it was kind of talking
[6:42] like everything's running out there in
[6:44] the scriptures and it says but those
[6:46] people laughed
[6:47] something to that degree you know there
[6:49] there's people left that saw these
[6:51] things and I'm very pleased to
[6:53] fellowship among the people that did see
[6:57] the things called we don't put any
[6:58] emphasis no more than what it is it's a
[7:01] truth that God did come down in the last
[7:03] days and you know bringing the word all
[7:07] right all that's well and good but the
[7:09] main thing I want is the word these
[7:12] because I can believe brother wrote told
[7:14] me he said I've seen the dead raised a
[7:16] sick healed I've seen all kind of thing
[7:18] I said that's wonderful
[7:20] I said I believe you so I'm not doubting
[7:24] you have no reason to but I said you
[7:28] just saw that you tell me what he told
[7:32] in the word and I'll know from my own
[7:36] experience whether he was a prophet or
[7:38] not but I couldn't go by what he saw
[7:41] because he could be lying about it you
[7:43] know if people could be lying today
[7:45] about this side the other but if you got
[7:47] something personal with inside of you
[7:50] then all the rest of it's wonderful
[7:52] because that's you know things to dwell
[7:56] upon and real good alright but now see
[8:01] I'm still trying to express to you
[8:04] something that I'm you know I'm trying
[8:07] to bring out from
[8:09] my thoughts to your thoughts of the fact
[8:12] of how that God came into manifestation
[8:17] or whatever the words you want to call
[8:19] it came into view came into revealing
[8:24] himself and showing himself and coming
[8:27] down through time and how that he
[8:29] started out as the great self existing
[8:32] on the word I would be used Elohim
[8:34] because that would just be the fact that
[8:36] that would be the only word they could
[8:38] pick up I guess to everybody to be able
[8:40] to understand what it meant and how that
[8:42] it was God to reveal himself all right
[8:45] but then how he come down and manifested
[8:48] himself through this and we're but we're
[8:50] still back I'm still back before time in
[8:56] other words my thoughts are still
[8:57] dealing with what took place before time
[9:01] came into being all right we've got a
[9:04] lot to do then we get over time and then
[9:07] we'll see why John says that all things
[9:09] were created by him and all and who was
[9:11] to him according to my Bible Jesus
[9:14] Christ is to create cars all right not
[9:17] Jesus the flesh but Jesus the Christ
[9:20] he's the creator and that's why it was
[9:23] wonderful when Peter said thou art the
[9:26] Christ he was actually recognizing Jesus
[9:29] as being the great eternal God that
[9:32] created all things because he called him
[9:34] the Christ so it was brought out all
[9:37] right now that's what I'm still trying
[9:39] to do is we haven't got over into to
[9:42] time all right and I know I have a very
[9:46] odd way of expressing things and you
[9:48] know it's all right I'll try to get it
[9:51] expressed one of these days but now
[9:54] remember what I've always taught you
[9:58] that no matter what you think about what
[10:02] somebody is saying check it out with the
[10:04] Bible and see if it's right check it out
[10:07] with the prophets message to see if it's
[10:09] right they may be right and you might be
[10:12] wrong all right but that's you know
[10:15] check it out and see what's what is
[10:17] happening and remember that no matter
[10:21] what you think I'm saying
[10:24] that I have never taught any way of
[10:28] thinking that we come into the world
[10:31] with eternal life you say well I've got
[10:34] where the Prophet said this and probably
[10:36] said that that's good
[10:37] I got scriptures too that says a lot of
[10:39] things about you know we'll get into
[10:41] those scriptures and time but the thing
[10:43] about it is people want to bring this
[10:45] eternal life and they don't want to wait
[10:48] because if you came into the world with
[10:49] eternal life then you explain to me why
[10:52] Jesus Christ had to die I mean that's
[10:54] the only question I'm God if I come in
[10:57] the world eternal life Jesus Christ is
[10:59] not to die so that means I didn't come
[11:01] in with it all right now we use the word
[11:05] redeemed but you ever thought about the
[11:09] word regime yeah
[11:13] we know what it means to go back where
[11:16] we come from that's good that's real
[11:22] good that's straight that's right
[11:26] redeemed mean to go back where you come
[11:28] from but then how come everybody in the
[11:33] message wants to kind of keep you and
[11:35] try to give you eternal life when you
[11:36] come into the world he said what do they
[11:40] do that yeah they do that because if
[11:45] redeem is correct then it means you fail
[11:52] is that sensual to be regain back where
[11:58] you came from means you fail from dark
[12:01] is that sensible that doesn't need a
[12:05] great big light bulb turn onto to
[12:06] explain that little point does it it
[12:09] just plain language that if you're going
[12:14] to go back to where you came from that
[12:15] means you fail from dark that means you
[12:18] never came that away all right and we'll
[12:22] get to those signs as we're going along
[12:23] but I don't want you to ever think then
[12:25] you know you hear me talk about it and
[12:28] reading and giving the quotes of the
[12:30] Prophet in the scriptures I and people
[12:33] get the idea of it that you're thinking
[12:35] about you know
[12:36] we're random would say you always was
[12:38] eternal well now if that's not
[12:41] understood in the correct understanding
[12:43] you sure got a lot messed up in your
[12:46] Bible and you got a lot messed up in in
[12:49] the truth so we want to stay with that
[12:52] until we can see it in the correct order
[12:55] so no matter what you think I'm saying
[12:57] just remember I am NOT saying and I've
[13:01] never told that we come into the world
[13:04] with eternal life because that would
[13:07] annihilate Jesus saying you must be born
[13:09] again that would annihilate all of the
[13:11] things it would put the whole thing out
[13:14] of shape alright you say but but the
[13:16] Prophet said it will amen but remember
[13:19] if you don't understand what the Prophet
[13:22] said and it goes in the right order you
[13:23] can make him say anything you want to
[13:27] that's as plain as I can put it but I
[13:30] want you to see that fact because I
[13:32] believe you must be born again
[13:36] all right that was Jesus's first
[13:39] doctrine you must be born again all
[13:42] right I believe that according to the
[13:44] Bible that I must believe in my heart
[13:47] Romans right and confess with my mouth I
[13:53] must do that to be saved it's not to die
[13:57] just say well I always was eternal I've
[14:02] had people who looks right you can't
[14:03] tell me I'm not eternal always was he
[14:05] terminal you know I mean telling you
[14:08] that he'll tell you that to your face
[14:09] because they're trying to stay with some
[14:11] idea or some concept but I've never
[14:14] believed done like that so now I want
[14:15] that in here to where when we start
[14:17] reading things or talking about things
[14:19] you won't have that in mind you'll say
[14:21] wait a minute now he said he never
[14:24] believed that way of what it sounds like
[14:28] is being say it see I believe the Bible
[14:32] were you born in sin safer than iniquity
[14:34] and the spouse from your mother's womb
[14:36] and you're going forth a liar and you're
[14:39] doomed and on your way to hell and if
[14:42] you don't get born again you've got a
[14:45] problem
[14:46] I've always taught that and always
[14:48] believed it so when you come up to the
[14:51] word always was or thoughts like I'm
[14:53] trying to bring of how that something
[14:55] was transpiring before the foundation of
[14:58] the world before this world ever came
[15:04] into existence we've been through it
[15:07] we're in Joe we're talking like the
[15:09] morning stars sang together the sons of
[15:11] God shouted for joy we've been through
[15:15] that your name was written in the book
[15:17] of the book of the life of the Lamb that
[15:19] was slain before the foundation of the
[15:21] world
[15:22] it was done before then we've been
[15:29] through all the things on predestination
[15:31] because I've been preaching this for
[15:33] forty about forty eight years and I'm
[15:37] glad that we've got at least a pice
[15:40] thirty years still left in our tape
[15:42] collection that you're welcome to go to
[15:44] and see if I change the doctrine it's
[15:47] not being sarcastic it's being truthful
[15:49] I do a lot of things a lot of other
[15:52] preachers don't they said we're on the
[15:55] internet system and I don't cover a lot
[15:57] of things but there's a tape being made
[15:59] right back there that is kept anybody
[16:06] preaching in this church that tape is
[16:08] kept for us to see if I change if we
[16:13] change if Bob change their hearing
[16:15] changer this change or you know we've
[16:19] got them down we can check it out I'm
[16:21] always glad if you do that not being no
[16:24] sarcastic way just being truthful
[16:27] because I want you to know what I
[16:31] believe and then you can make up your
[16:34] mind whether you believe it or not
[16:35] because I can't reveal it to you come on
[16:39] is that what Peter said you say into
[16:41] Jesus dark necropsy said now wait a
[16:43] minute I'm paraphrasing brother around
[16:45] him with the wording he said my said
[16:47] jesus said my own life didn't reveal
[16:50] that under the Peter he said it was a
[16:52] father in heaven it revealed that and
[16:56] said I ain't gonna build on nothing on
[16:58] you as a rock I'm gonna
[17:00] your revelation of who I am right all
[17:04] right see that away then we keep it
[17:06] straight and we keep in mind what we're
[17:10] trying to do no all right
[17:14] still back before the foundation of the
[17:16] world and our thinking still back in the
[17:20] point of thinking about before the world
[17:23] ever was even thought of or anything
[17:27] happened that God existed knew how
[17:37] freaks didn't believe it I've got quotes
[17:39] for it and read it to you that God is a
[17:41] being he's a person but he's not one two
[17:47] three cuz ain't no society
[17:50] he's either God are we the most mixed-up
[17:53] people that has ever been alright we see
[17:56] them believing that he is real believing
[18:02] that he is not like the wind blowing to
[18:07] and fro then he's not just some kind of
[18:10] a spirit moving around and seed we
[18:12] always had that you know we all love
[18:14] that then God is a spirit and they that
[18:17] worship it much worse than in spirit in
[18:18] true well then how you gonna work some
[18:20] in spirit and truth you ain't in the
[18:21] same spirit here is that sensible you're
[18:26] not in the same spirit he's in how you
[18:27] going to worship in spirit and truth all
[18:29] right but see just to be to get to point
[18:32] to where we were driving at the last
[18:35] message you remember how we were talking
[18:38] about it that God in His great mind
[18:42] before anything ever existed
[18:46] you ever NAT that would ever come into
[18:50] the world I wouldn't the one that wrote
[18:54] the Bible where he said that we were
[18:57] chosen in him before the foundation of
[19:02] the world I didn't not to word he did I
[19:07] didn't write where he said you didn't
[19:09] choose me I chose you
[19:13] well yeah but I wouldn't ride and I
[19:16] prayed you don't understand the rest of
[19:19] the Bible either what does it say it
[19:21] says the goodness of God is what leads
[19:23] you to repentance
[19:24] read your Bible you'll find out it's got
[19:27] a lot of good things in the goodness of
[19:29] God is what drugged you and out of God
[19:31] no man can come to the Father what Jesus
[19:35] said in the length under me unless the
[19:36] father draws him right it's all right
[19:39] now see we got the whole thing settled
[19:42] in the basis of understanding but my
[19:45] point is trying to get us to think about
[19:49] that we could not have existed back tyre
[19:52] as people you know we wasn't spirits we
[19:59] gave those quotes we was in the mind of
[20:03] God all right but what about the mind of
[20:08] God as I've always told you I don't want
[20:12] to be just in the mind of God because
[20:17] Judas Iscariot was in the mind of God I
[20:21] don't want to just be in his mind I want
[20:25] to be part of his mind I want him to be
[20:29] into me so much until his mind and Paul
[20:32] would say that what let the mind that
[20:34] was in Christ be in you it'll make you a
[20:38] new creature what I do and give you a
[20:40] new bird I won't dad I want to be a part
[20:44] of the one that was doing the thinking
[20:46] not to just a thought in his mind he
[20:49] thought of Judas Iscariot he thought of
[20:51] Adolf Hitler he thought if everybody's
[20:53] ever be in the world he knew everybody's
[20:57] ever be in the world right what you see
[21:02] we'd say what I want if I was just in
[21:04] his mind well how much you in this mind
[21:09] now I want to go back and find out it
[21:11] I'm part of this man and well I don't
[21:16] see how you can be that well why not
[21:18] are you part of your father
[21:25] alright are you part of your father are
[21:29] you part of your grandfather are you
[21:31] part of your great grandfather the great
[21:32] grandmother great the great the great
[21:34] the great great I mean what greats you
[21:35] need your part of that right because of
[21:38] the DNA by the DNA you can be all the
[21:42] way back and that's why I love the Bible
[21:44] see here it comes alone back there and
[21:49] Levi paid tithes while he was in Abraham
[21:55] ask roots ring you said well how'd he do
[21:59] that because it was representation
[22:02] coming all the way down before the
[22:06] foundation of the world I said in job
[22:09] said where were you in the morning stars
[22:10] sang together the sons of God shouted
[22:12] for joy that was back before the world
[22:16] ever started see what we think of
[22:21] predestination and and things like that
[22:25] is we think we haven't figured out now
[22:27] that it's by foreknowledge well amen
[22:30] because the Bible says those who he for
[22:32] no he did predestinate all right
[22:35] foreknowledge is before predestination
[22:38] we've got that straight at least it
[22:41] ought to be that if you've got any form
[22:46] of predestination you got to back up
[22:47] behind ur to a foreknowledge because the
[22:52] foreknowledge would cause him to
[22:53] predetermine it see I don't see why we
[22:58] can't accept the truth really I do know
[23:03] why because it's not meant for a lot of
[23:05] people lunch I'll read you the Hat in
[23:08] the Prophet it's not meant you know that
[23:11] God was talking about the other day he
[23:13] didn't know I had all these in my notes
[23:14] I believe it was him that mentioned or
[23:16] one of the brothers anyhow you know that
[23:18] God didn't come to save the devil's
[23:20] children right didn't come save the
[23:25] devil children while you're making it
[23:28] we're a lot of people can't recite no
[23:30] I'm making it work if they're not God's
[23:32] children they won't
[23:34] but I'm making it this way do you know
[23:37] that when you've got lost and you come
[23:41] into this world as a sinner you work in
[23:44] folks to the devil whether you like it
[23:48] or not the devil is my daddy if I'm not
[23:53] born again he's your daddy if you're not
[23:57] born again right see then that puts it
[24:01] all straight and in line there's no
[24:04] arguments because you say yes but we
[24:09] believe predestination praise God I do
[24:11] too but I believe that the foreknowledge
[24:16] comes before the pre determining all
[24:19] right why can't you back up a little
[24:21] further then into God's mind that's what
[24:24] I've been trying to do why not back up
[24:26] to the point of where he was thinking
[24:33] come on back up to where his those who
[24:38] he foreknew or for Noah's Obama fair
[24:43] when I back up to where his thinking was
[24:46] that you might find out you're part of
[24:49] this thinking you might find out you're
[24:52] part of him wouldn't it be wonderful
[24:57] well you sound like that you're saying
[25:00] that there's people that that's what I
[25:04] said
[25:05] you get it in your mind and you say well
[25:07] brother Dale is saying that he's talking
[25:10] about somebody being eternal now I'm
[25:12] talking about eternal life I'm saying it
[25:18] over and over to for me and you to have
[25:20] eternal life we've got to receive
[25:23] eternal life that is the gift of God is
[25:28] that right eternal life through Jesus
[25:30] Christ all right so keep it in straight
[25:33] in your mind what I'm saying well where
[25:38] were the morning stars and Suns of
[25:39] garden and all that where is that taking
[25:41] place see let's back up a little farther
[25:46] than
[25:47] read estimation look back up into his
[25:50] foreknowledge and we might find that
[25:58] we're a part of that we'll find out the
[26:01] right way that we're a part of it
[26:05] today don't like us anything when it
[26:10] settles the whole situation of
[26:12] predestination it settled the whole
[26:14] thing of these things that are messing
[26:16] people talking about I come with a seed
[26:18] in me I believe that but the only
[26:23] problem I mind is one time when was the
[26:27] seed put any may I ask simple question I
[26:36] love questions you know that I love
[26:38] questions an answer we have questions
[26:40] and answers on the first Saturday of
[26:42] every month we love it we just get down
[26:44] and we talk about things and we have
[26:46] some pretty good little girls every once
[26:49] in a while you might call it discussing
[26:51] things because we just allow everybody
[26:54] to discuss it you know and talk about it
[26:59] why not see is just a simple question
[27:05] and then I asked for a simple answer but
[27:11] can you give me the simple answer
[27:17] without making it such a great
[27:21] monstrosity or trying to express it and
[27:24] understand it we listen to the
[27:27] simplicity of a little seventh grade
[27:29] educated man who explained all of these
[27:31] signs when was the seed of God put in
[27:35] you biggest portion people this message
[27:39] believe you come to see Jenny I do too
[27:40] but you better get it right you don't
[27:43] talk to me about it how about saying
[27:47] where the prophet said you seed was put
[27:49] in you you know where he when he said
[27:56] the seed was put in
[27:58] he said was put in before the foundation
[28:01] of the world I got him here live in
[28:09] front of me so you want to agree the
[28:10] mighty one don't now get to it Sunday
[28:13] cuz I'm I'm worried I've had two months
[28:20] now to study on this to try to express
[28:22] away to where we could understand if the
[28:27] seed was put in you before the
[28:28] foundation the world
[28:29] that's easy to catch them know I was
[28:33] born with this seed is put in me when I
[28:34] had one will you show me the Prophet was
[28:36] put in you where nears born I'll show
[28:39] you where he said it was put in you
[28:41] before the foundation world see then we
[28:49] get it all figured out we know all about
[28:50] this this seed of that what good is a
[28:52] seed without moisture come on we're
[28:56] farmers we're old people we plant food
[28:58] we plant graves with like corn with what
[29:01] good is any seed you put in the ground
[29:03] without moisture the Lord Jesus sowed
[29:08] the seed come on is that the parable the
[29:11] children of the kingdom or the seed of
[29:13] God that Jesus Christ showed the
[29:16] children of the devil were the ones that
[29:18] the devil showed are we still in the
[29:22] Bible Lee well yeah we we want different
[29:28] that see we want to that we want to try
[29:31] to get something to make this thing feel
[29:33] good don't you worry about it just
[29:37] getting the word the older it gets it
[29:39] don't feel quite as good as you stir so
[29:41] there's a lot of us on the downhill drag
[29:45] right being plain sorry but it's the
[29:55] best way to say it
[29:57] listen what was the life stock that we
[30:02] had brother branham said it will read it
[30:06] from Christ mister God reveal that God
[30:09] in the back part of his mind
[30:13] he had a plan in the purpose now he said
[30:17] in the back part of his mind see then in
[30:21] your human mind you have conscious
[30:25] subconscious and really you have an
[30:27] unconscious we don't we'll deal with
[30:29] that unconscious because it's not much
[30:31] to understand we have enough trouble
[30:34] with the conscious and the unconscious
[30:35] on see you how things that you dream
[30:40] dreams you're in a subconscious on point
[30:44] you know you dream dreams those are real
[30:47] to you but you have a natural knowledge
[30:52] out here well I now remember how we were
[30:56] trying to bring it out if I don't get
[30:58] any more I'll get this point you
[31:01] remember how we were trying to bring it
[31:02] out to life's message I doubt if any of
[31:05] yous went back and listened to it
[31:07] because you didn't care what I said that
[31:09] time you don't care what I say to not
[31:11] show you're not going to listen to it
[31:12] anyway I'm sorry but that's playing what
[31:18] you see God evidently if he made man in
[31:28] His image and likeness sometimes who
[31:30] must be pretty close the simulation
[31:32] every what you call it you know he looks
[31:34] like and everything it works right and
[31:36] see God has us two parts of his mind
[31:42] you remember how we're trying to bring
[31:44] that out one part of God's mind it knows
[31:50] everything that's taking place right he
[31:56] knows every now he knows everything you
[31:58] know he's ever moving over everything
[31:59] and that's part of his mind and he knew
[32:03] that before the world right and he could
[32:08] predetermine by what we would choose
[32:13] correctly but what about the Bible that
[32:17] keeps saying you didn't choose me I
[32:21] chose you
[32:23] and ordained you what about which one
[32:27] was it was Jeremiah the Prophet he said
[32:30] I saw you and ordained you I'm quoting
[32:33] scripture before the world ever begun
[32:37] those prophets were predestinated now
[32:46] listen
[32:47] so then think about it we relay so much
[32:55] own wording there's human terminologies
[32:59] when we have to use it but that's why I
[33:01] love the Bible in the way it would do
[33:04] because it'll say something about God
[33:09] created this or created the world
[33:10] whatever you know what that has a
[33:13] beginning because he created it if he
[33:19] created it the word created mean it had
[33:21] a beginning but when he come to man he
[33:24] said let us make man then use the word
[33:28] creator
[33:28] Genesis 1:26 and 27 huh he said let us
[33:32] make man instead he made man in His
[33:35] image long if you remember the thoughts
[33:40] we were trying to bring out that God
[33:47] anything he creates is the beginning it
[33:54] has a beginning with anything that's a
[33:58] part of him doesn't have a beginning so
[34:03] what we got to do we got to find out
[34:04] some way to get back far enough to find
[34:06] out some way that we can be a part of
[34:08] him is that planning out and you know
[34:11] you don't go back there to find it you
[34:12] know where you go you go right in the
[34:14] altar and find your new birth you'll
[34:17] find your Newburg puts you to the right
[34:19] place now quote from spoken words
[34:21] original seed butter run said it have
[34:23] borne that away by the words of spirit
[34:24] he said takes you back like it was in
[34:26] the beginning and this is words he said
[34:27] he said I'd never seen that before
[34:29] someone spoken word for it no seed he
[34:32] called it right then it would put us
[34:35] back like the original like we should
[34:36] have been
[34:37] we'll get to those things as we come
[34:39] down under talking about when we get to
[34:41] the creation of mankind and and get to
[34:43] the creation of the world and the things
[34:45] like that but just remember when he
[34:49] created the world it had a beginning
[34:52] he created a lot it had a beginning he
[34:56] created animals it had a beginning then
[35:06] he said let us make man you say let us
[35:14] create man looks like me
[35:23] now then there would be a part of God's
[35:25] mind that would know all about the world
[35:27] and all the things and everything that
[35:29] would ever take place and how you would
[35:31] create and what he would do and he'd
[35:35] know if every person had ever come into
[35:37] the world and why it would be but then
[35:41] in the back part of his mind he would be
[35:45] dwelling with his thoughts alone is that
[35:50] Elohim the self existing one who dwelt
[35:53] along with his thoughts see if you can
[36:01] see how that you're a part of God you
[36:03] see you didn't have no beginning then it
[36:05] won't be no problem for the Prophet to
[36:06] say you always was eternal all you got
[36:10] to do is get the right line up you don't
[36:13] have to rip out those pages you know how
[36:15] to do it like a man told me one time
[36:17] he's telling me he said certain part of
[36:20] the Bible he said in order be tore up
[36:24] this coat out I said give me a Bible I
[36:28] was gonna turn it out if it ain't no
[36:32] good tired out well he wouldn't do it
[36:36] well there should be a lot of our ideas
[36:39] may over be taught and thought out but
[36:41] make a simple little point this is as
[36:46] simple it is anything that's created has
[36:49] a beginning come on revelation 3:14 they
[36:59] said he's the beginning of the creation
[37:00] of God you know who that's talking about
[37:03] Jesus Christ when he come into human
[37:05] flesh
[37:06] you know what is human flesh at a
[37:08] beginning right so he's the beginning of
[37:13] the creation of God he began he was
[37:15] created in the wound of a Virgin Mary of
[37:18] creation but the God that dwelled in
[37:22] that body it's why I read the fullness
[37:25] of the Godhead bodily dwell in him see
[37:29] that soul in that spirit of Almighty God
[37:31] that came into that body that was the
[37:34] little baby we call Jesus
[37:37] had no beginning and had no ending it
[37:44] was always eternal because it was
[37:46] eternal God there's no beginning to the
[37:52] eternal God so if you can see you're a
[37:55] part of God then you can understand why
[37:57] the Prophet would say you always was
[37:58] eternal and then turn around till you
[38:02] receive eternal life at the altar then
[38:05] turn around tell you you must be born
[38:06] again because you're not born again
[38:08] you're going to die and go to hell
[38:14] see then that was the point of trying to
[38:17] get of what that garden his mind could
[38:21] think of everything he could write the
[38:26] book of life he could run all the way
[38:27] but you know there's more in the book a
[38:29] lot because that's why that I'm in
[38:31] Phatak Lee stated to it said it we call
[38:34] it the book of life that the Bible
[38:35] doesn't say the book a lot the Bible
[38:37] says the book of the life of the Lamb
[38:39] that was slain before the foundation of
[38:41] the world because if you're saying book
[38:43] of life your name can be in the book of
[38:45] life and Judas Iscariot's name was in
[38:48] the book of life and removed from the
[38:51] book of life which you cannot remove a
[38:54] name from the book of the life of the
[38:56] Lamb that was slain because that's his
[39:00] children you realize when people that
[39:05] watch on judgment you believe that there
[39:06] will be a white throne judgment you
[39:08] believe there will be people giving
[39:09] eternal life it to watch their own
[39:10] judgment do you believe that you know
[39:12] what that's impartation that's not a
[39:15] child of God that's in partition that
[39:22] doesn't make them a child of God come on
[39:27] but to a born-again Christian they are a
[39:32] child of God why because they're his
[39:38] offspring is that what Paul said on Mars
[39:40] he'll when you got up there any got to
[39:43] looking around and seeing all these
[39:44] things in all the places all the little
[39:46] things and they have them laid for
[39:46] everybody and this in case they miss one
[39:48] to that little box maybe sitting there
[39:50] and it said to the unknown God Paul said
[39:55] I just like to talk to y'all a little
[39:57] bit about that he said I like to talk to
[39:59] you about the unknown God you know what
[40:02] he preached Jesus Christ to those people
[40:05] and he said even your poets say it says
[40:10] that we are his offspring he realized
[40:16] that not if you're a born-again
[40:17] Christian with the baptism of the Holy
[40:18] Ghost eternal life in your soul that
[40:20] you're just as eternal in soul if God
[40:23] ever was because God life is in you
[40:30] because life is in you make your life
[40:35] eternal let's see we want to come into
[40:38] the world with eternal life where we
[40:39] don't have to worry about it
[40:40] then we want the evidence that I believe
[40:42] everything cause I believe the message
[40:43] right well tell me where the Prophet
[40:46] said itself I didn't think he said it
[40:51] was what do you believe the message or
[40:52] not I thought he said it's the fact of
[40:57] whether or not the spirit in you agrees
[40:59] with the word ah that's the same time
[41:03] then you don't know that ain't exactly
[41:06] the same time a little different there
[41:11] see the proof of the new birth is
[41:14] whether or not what's in you agrees with
[41:15] the word if it don't agree with the word
[41:18] then it's not of God right what you see
[41:23] if we only go back to pre destinations
[41:27] or the foreknowledge is in pre
[41:32] determining by foreknowledge ease and
[41:34] say we're only dealing with the part of
[41:36] God's mind that knows everything because
[41:38] at the same time that he predestinated
[41:40] you by foreknowledge he predestinated
[41:43] Judas before knowledge right cause he
[41:51] predestinated everything by
[41:53] foreknowledge his foreknowledge was
[41:57] worst that he could determine it but the
[42:01] problem would say God knew you and
[42:03] wanted
[42:04] and said he'd haven't here for you
[42:06] because he knew you'd wanted at the same
[42:10] time he knew you'd wondered he knew
[42:11] others would want it for a little while
[42:15] and go with it for a little while and be
[42:19] borderline believers and things like
[42:20] that and go along for a while but
[42:23] eventually would go away why because
[42:25] since the character of life in this
[42:26] setting the other takes it away the toy
[42:28] and the time is I'm am i still quoting
[42:30] scriptures from Matthew Mark Luke and
[42:32] John you see why I asked you a few
[42:34] months ago read Matthew Mark Luke and
[42:36] John over and over and over and over you
[42:40] ever want to know anything that rose
[42:41] they will tell you to read read Matthew
[42:42] Mark Luke and John that was a lifetime I
[42:46] the thing I talked to Ricky for Bush
[42:48] before he passed away that was a last
[42:50] thing I told I said Ricky don't try to
[42:53] figure out and read the Book of
[42:54] Revelations to try to figure out what
[42:56] this is or Daniel or these books or that
[42:58] book stay away from that I said get
[43:00] simply in Matthew Mark Luke and John and
[43:02] start reading from Matthew Mark Luke and
[43:06] John and I said you'll come out with the
[43:08] right guy not because we want to
[43:14] understand all these great things and
[43:15] say that's evidence of the Holy Ghost
[43:18] according to my understanding the Bible
[43:20] says you can have all wisdom to know all
[43:23] mystery but have not eternal love right
[43:35] do you see what I'm driving at see with
[43:38] with the part of God's mind is that as
[43:42] far as we can go back we've done a
[43:43] wonderful job and don't discounted that
[43:45] it took me 40 something years to try to
[43:48] bring what I'm talking about
[43:49] I preached up to it and see it preached
[43:53] up to it see it preach it and try to
[43:54] bring it keep trying to climb higher and
[43:56] higher and higher 40 something years
[43:58] I've been preaching on predestination I
[44:03] was thinking today about it work that
[44:06] the first sermon I preached in this
[44:07] message with 1969 in Athens Georgia but
[44:11] there's no there's people sitting here
[44:13] that was out of that day but they
[44:14] wouldn't recognize and understand that
[44:15] we
[44:16] this is maybe even of it but does that
[44:19] mean I didn't do it because about 30
[44:22] years ago I'll take you from about the
[44:24] police it was mentioned 30 years ago you
[44:28] know make it one out 40 what you see
[44:34] I saw Jesus Christ and I taught then
[44:41] that the bride of Jesus Christ would be
[44:43] the son of man the Word made flesh in a
[44:49] group of people not in this brother
[44:52] branham brother Branham was not the son
[44:55] of man brother Branham is not the one
[44:58] standing in Revelations one where it
[45:02] says he's go about the pouch with a
[45:04] golden girdle standing in the seven
[45:05] golden candlesticks that your prophet
[45:07] said was the bride but you see you say
[45:11] well I say something like that you just
[45:13] say what he just trying to do no I'm
[45:14] trying to tell you what God has been
[45:16] doing he's been trying to reveal himself
[45:19] to his people but they won't listen they
[45:22] got it figured out this way or that away
[45:24] or it's going to be here going to be
[45:25] that we're going to have it by certain
[45:26] president we don't have it by somebody
[45:28] at one we're told finally getting the
[45:29] White House we're gonna make it tell me
[45:33] that in the Bible according to my Bible
[45:40] she's been in the White House all along
[45:43] is that right you want to go to
[45:46] revelation 17 the old mother and
[45:49] the harlot daughters because the first
[45:53] thing I done when I come into this
[45:55] message and I heard brother Brown
[45:56] talking about how the Catholic would
[45:58] worm its way into the White House you
[45:59] know what I done I got all the books I
[46:01] could get everything I could get and I
[46:03] wrote it in front of my Bible at
[46:04] somewhere but they were that was 19 in
[46:07] 67 66 or 67 at that time it was about
[46:11] eleven or twelve hundred Catholics
[46:15] already in the White House see when he
[46:18] said times I wanted to see it I'm not
[46:21] interested in him coming after all
[46:23] because I know what I'm interested it it
[46:26] says when you see Jerusalem compassed
[46:28] about
[46:30] we're over here Russia's over here turn
[46:32] it over here there there when you see
[46:34] that that's what the Bible says listen
[46:38] Church I'm just trying to get you to see
[46:40] something to profit from Chrysler
[46:43] mysteries it back in the back part of
[46:46] God's mind why would you go to the back
[46:49] part and why would he say in Christ the
[46:55] mystery let's see do you remember it he
[46:59] said what about knowing that's all alone
[47:00] in not being able to try to explain it
[47:03] in other words it's in Christ mystery he
[47:07] said he knew it all alone but couldn't
[47:10] bring it to the people what about it why
[47:15] did he know all along I thought - mr.
[47:20] cross the mystery of God revealed was
[47:22] that God entered his mind a plan and a
[47:25] purpose if he was planning on
[47:27] accomplishing and you know what he said
[47:32] alpha-1 message this is when I love you
[47:34] know what he said off of the message
[47:39] masterpiece if you had something in his
[47:44] mind he wanted to display he said it was
[47:49] to make man in his own image you need to
[47:54] read that that's what he had in his mind
[47:58] my brother Dale the Chrysler mister God
[48:01] revealed is a great mixture the Seventh
[48:03] Seal well evidently that must be what
[48:05] the Seventh Seal did because that's what
[48:10] he explained you want to read a little
[48:12] bit of it let's just read some of it
[48:14] because see you get the point of one
[48:16] Gumba I'm not talking about God he's got
[48:18] a split mind he's doing this and he's
[48:20] doing that it's illustrating that God
[48:23] knows everything
[48:26] but then he can back up further than
[48:29] just his own foreknowledge he so know
[48:36] you can't go back face your own
[48:37] foreknowledge you can if you turn around
[48:41] and walk back with the one that does the
[48:43] thinking that's what I've always told
[48:46] you I don't want to be just what God
[48:48] thinks huh I want to be part of his mind
[48:51] I want what Paul said that the mind of
[48:55] Christ you said would regret avail the
[48:59] Bible says our mind our cry to make a
[49:00] new creature that's a new creation
[49:03] praise God because he we was lost and he
[49:10] had to change things but when he made
[49:13] Adam he made him different he made Adam
[49:18] in his own image
[49:23] that was a spiritual man that he made
[49:26] right what about it what are we looking
[49:29] at let's go ahead some let's take up a
[49:31] few of these but whoever's on the pole
[49:33] biker today I've been giving you some
[49:35] you've been getting you some relaxed
[49:37] time you hadn't been running out having
[49:38] to keep up let's go to Christ mr. God
[49:41] reveal paragraph 102 let's just see well
[49:47] they're getting onto it and bringing it
[49:48] up huh
[49:49] God a secret mystery he had before the
[49:54] world begun now back in the back part of
[49:57] God's mind there was something that he
[49:59] was trying and was going to achieve
[50:02] right he had a motive in doing it what
[50:05] was his motive in order to let himself
[50:07] be express express his attributes right
[50:13] look at Aetna second right because first
[50:16] there wasn't even a Moonstar atom
[50:17] molecule or anything he was God but he
[50:19] actually wasn't God at that time because
[50:21] God is an object of worship and there
[50:23] was nothing was nothing to worship him
[50:26] so in his great mind he wanted these
[50:29] attributes to be displayed not you
[50:33] better be expressed you better listen
[50:39] and follow me for a second okay
[50:45] so in his great mind he wanted these
[50:48] attributes to be expressed in him was
[50:52] loved and him was to be father in him
[50:59] was to be son
[51:11] I can understand father I can understand
[51:15] healer
[51:16] I can understand Savior but what about
[51:24] in him was to be something what what's
[51:36] the key in him was to be son
[51:48] she then before the world ever begun
[51:51] you've got the word shun but remember
[51:58] anything had a beginning has an ending
[52:01] the word shun had no beginning you buddy
[52:10] such a son it sounds kind of have a
[52:11] beginning not the way God done it that's
[52:17] why the son the logos the word the
[52:23] thought the speech is what created all
[52:26] things the father never created nothing
[52:33] show me show me the message show me the
[52:35] Bible where the father created anything
[52:39] now the son created but remember now
[52:43] we're not being no co-equal and
[52:46] coeternal in the Trinity sometimes we're
[52:49] in the line of her right so the father
[52:52] became the son it could be father
[52:57] because he created man he could be son
[53:02] and Savior
[53:03] true but the main thing is he's son in
[53:07] creation come on hebrews 1 says Jesus
[53:13] Christ created all the time
[53:15] Colossians 1 says he quit Oh John 1 we
[53:19] just read city created and I believe
[53:22] it's James 3 and 9 said all things were
[53:25] made by Jesus Christ and without him
[53:26] there was not anything made that was
[53:28] made
[53:28] so now we've done established a
[53:33] doctrinal issue of a thought just
[53:38] because you call him son don't make him
[53:40] a heaven in the beginning remember you
[53:45] are the sons and daughters of the Living
[53:49] God by the new word right you now know
[53:52] beginning what it took to make you
[53:57] eternal to be a son of God and know
[54:01] beginning there's an impartation god
[54:06] just stepped over in another phone you
[54:10] were to read real slow sometimes and
[54:11] think about what you read and him was to
[54:14] be son and him would to be savoring him
[54:16] which will be healer all these great
[54:17] attributes that we see already expressed
[54:19] they were in God go ahead to the next
[54:21] paragraph 105 Christ the mystery of God
[54:23] reveal God had a purpose and a hidden
[54:26] mystery and that's what I want to speak
[54:28] on to the church this morning the hidden
[54:30] mystery of God that he had in his mind
[54:32] before the world ever began and how that
[54:34] is unfolded itself right down to this
[54:36] present hour that we're living see then
[54:39] you will understand clearly then you see
[54:42] on I believe what is being done it's
[54:48] still going on you realize every time a
[54:50] newborn baby comes into Christ God is
[54:54] still dividing himself when that newborn
[54:59] child amount of 80 years old 30 years
[55:01] old
[55:01] you know what I mean anybody receiving
[55:03] the new birth God is still giving his
[55:05] eternal life like brother Moke said
[55:09] don't worry about like a knife or you
[55:10] cut it up and you give out your pieces
[55:12] and you end up with it just remember as
[55:14] much as you cut up God and try to get
[55:16] him out there going to be that much more
[55:17] for him to give away that's why that
[55:20] devil wouldn't smart if that devil had
[55:23] just stayed where he's at to kill Jesus
[55:25] hung him on a cross for told him in a
[55:26] tune that didn't do no good by doing
[55:29] that he had 120 Jesus's to face he ought
[55:34] to left them alone but he getting right
[55:36] outside they went there was 3,000 more
[55:39] little Jesus's he'd have been smart if
[55:43] he did just went on to his self and
[55:45] stayed there he can't do it he's a
[55:47] destroyer okay sorry let's go to the
[55:49] next one but let's see what he wanted to
[55:52] make huh the masterpiece he don't want
[55:59] Michelangelo and reading to the Great's
[56:00] culture who before there was a world
[56:02] he's coming to Christ right and for the
[56:05] foundation was laid he had in his mind
[56:07] what he wanted now what did he want what
[56:13] did God want
[56:14] well he wanted a whirl he wanted to do
[56:16] this and he wanted to do that and he
[56:18] wanted to build this and he wanted to do
[56:20] all of this at the other he wanted to
[56:25] make man in his own image where he could
[56:30] fellowship with him now come on church
[56:38] God can't fellowship with a devil
[56:41] children he will annihilate him
[56:52] but he can fellowship with his own
[56:54] children and he will never annihilate
[56:58] them because look what he's saying he
[57:01] wanted to make man in his own image that
[57:03] was his whole purpose Genesis 1:26 and
[57:08] 27 now as I said let us make man he
[57:16] wanted to make something in reality of
[57:18] what was a vision to him what was in his
[57:23] thinking what was a part of him he
[57:28] wanted to bring into being what was a
[57:30] part of him we only think about father
[57:35] and in this out of the other and we
[57:38] think about it as a healer Redeemer etc
[57:43] right that's what we think about when we
[57:46] think about attributes which just
[57:50] remember now hope vertebra know that God
[57:53] dwelt alone with his attributes there
[58:01] was his children yeah but now you've got
[58:04] something before the world we known all
[58:06] along Ian's don't finally say it well
[58:08] praise God I hope he did cuz I've been
[58:10] saying it for forty something here I'm
[58:13] just glad you finally caught up to
[58:14] listen
[58:17] God's planning purpose is not to have
[58:20] all of mankind and the seeing in the
[58:22] world and all of the situation's he's
[58:27] planned what to have
[58:28] people to come into being he didn't have
[58:38] to be a father to him he was her father
[58:42] he didn't have to be a healer he was the
[58:46] healer he never gained an attribute by
[58:49] coming into the world all those
[58:51] attributes he had he's all free he
[59:03] wanted to bring into being his children
[59:05] well now you're making something I
[59:07] correct I'm not making nothing back
[59:09] there I'm telling you the other part of
[59:11] God's mine first part all mankind
[59:14] involved everybody all over the world
[59:16] everything predestination it all
[59:18] involves praise God we finally got that
[59:20] figured out and what about backing up in
[59:24] his mind to her that Jesus told us a
[59:28] sample I'll get to these later he said I
[59:33] had fellowship with you before the
[59:36] foundation of the world well I just back
[59:39] in his foreknowledge you're cutting
[59:44] yourself short you don't understand the
[59:45] Bible
[59:46] you're dying right there because that's
[59:48] exactly as far as mankind even in this
[59:50] message has been able to go it's
[59:52] foreknowledge to go back to get back to
[59:54] God thinking you don't hear anybody
[59:58] preaching that they know what to me just
[1:00:00] something anything that they want to be
[1:00:01] part of the tinkerer gets eternal life
[1:00:06] to be part of the very one that done the
[1:00:09] thinking because if it just is thinking
[1:00:11] he thought of a lot of people that'll
[1:00:13] never get eternal life he thought of a
[1:00:17] lot of people at the white throne that
[1:00:19] will be given eternal life but none of
[1:00:21] that is your children and don't forget
[1:00:28] what I said to start with we come into
[1:00:31] this world lost 10 folks to the devil
[1:00:34] you've got to have the new birth for God
[1:00:38] to transmit that eternal life into you
[1:00:42] to give you eternal life what I always
[1:00:46] works
[1:00:47] I'll talk to prophet out always worthy
[1:00:48] come what are you gonna do with it I'm
[1:00:57] showing you what you want to call it a
[1:00:59] contradiction you want to call it that I
[1:01:02] say it's not I said it's God's honest
[1:01:04] truth but one time in the Bible the
[1:01:09] Bible says that we are the sons of God
[1:01:14] they're not appear yet what would be we
[1:01:17] said when the in fear will be like him
[1:01:21] then another Bible says we were all lost
[1:01:26] doomed and on the way to hell now is
[1:01:35] that a contradiction you're making it
[1:01:40] one by your thinking see if you can
[1:01:47] allow it we'll get back to that if you
[1:01:48] allow it to come to a basis that one day
[1:01:51] we'll get out of heaven with this thing
[1:01:52] come to down towards the earth and start
[1:01:54] talking about sometimes because see when
[1:02:00] God created Adam he created a special
[1:02:04] man because he created a man that he
[1:02:08] wanted according the blasphemous names
[1:02:14] brother Branham said it
[1:02:15] Adam had eternal life especially he
[1:02:21] breathed into Adams nostrils a breath of
[1:02:24] eternal life well let let poor Eve out
[1:02:27] well then you're going to have to handle
[1:02:29] some more because brother Branham says
[1:02:31] that Adam was lonely because part of him
[1:02:33] was still left in theophany so he had to
[1:02:35] bring even to be okay you see what I'm
[1:02:42] doing I got a quote he wrote around and
[1:02:45] said I'm not doing this to try to see
[1:02:47] I'm not trying to do doing this to try
[1:02:48] to produce dr. drew I'm trying to do
[1:02:50] this to straighten out doctrine he said
[1:02:55] it's wonderful because I've told you not
[1:02:58] you do what you want to for 40 years
[1:03:03] I've been driving at one time trying to
[1:03:10] get you and me to see who we are and our
[1:03:16] purpose for being here and what's taking
[1:03:18] place trying to get you to see who you
[1:03:22] are what I'm a child of God because I
[1:03:26] predestinated back there
[1:03:28] God knew I'd want to be safe so he
[1:03:30] predestinated me to be safe now wrote
[1:03:32] around says you're wrong
[1:03:33] he said God never predestinated by his
[1:03:36] desires till now for all your desires
[1:03:44] out you see one of these days you're
[1:03:50] going to understand a little message
[1:03:52] your prophet brought to you it's called
[1:03:56] an unconditional covenant
[1:04:12] Ibraheim never even had a new birth and
[1:04:16] yet he got an unconditional covenant you
[1:04:23] see we're leaving those messages out we
[1:04:25] push them aside because we don't want to
[1:04:27] handle that you say how do you know we
[1:04:29] do that because that's what I've always
[1:04:30] done
[1:04:31] I don't mind telling you there's a lot
[1:04:35] of the messages I have to push aside
[1:04:38] they've bred a random talk time because
[1:04:40] I don't know what he's talking about
[1:04:42] I can't put it together so if I can't
[1:04:49] put it together I'll leave it alone but
[1:04:52] then after a while here coming home from
[1:04:54] the work to me and I always come through
[1:04:56] the scriptures and he'll open the
[1:05:00] scriptures you take quotes quotes quotes
[1:05:05] you can quote yourself to death in this
[1:05:07] message or you quote yourself to death
[1:05:08] in the Bible but when it comes together
[1:05:14] in brains eternal life who's going to
[1:05:19] worry about quoting what what did he say
[1:05:32] he said God wanted to create a man
[1:05:35] that's his whole goal that some cry
[1:05:39] semestre go read it over and over and
[1:05:41] over God's whole goal was to bring man
[1:05:48] into the world it would be his children
[1:05:52] not just to bring people into the world
[1:05:54] now listen I don't mean to go this way
[1:05:57] but it's going intellectual to many
[1:06:01] weeks of not preaching I guess dirty if
[1:06:03] bother there's a lot of people caught it
[1:06:04] on the preach that don't mean cuz it
[1:06:06] piled up so much I can't preach but you
[1:06:11] see if all we can go is back to pre
[1:06:14] destinations and for knowledge we're
[1:06:17] only looking at half the story because
[1:06:25] you're not seeing his plan and purpose
[1:06:28] you're thinking his plan and purpose was
[1:06:31] to create mankind well how come he
[1:06:34] created some right or something wrong
[1:06:37] you've got to go with that see you're
[1:06:44] not thinking you're just going back to a
[1:06:48] point that we've got it favored brother
[1:06:50] Dale I thought I had it figured out I've
[1:06:52] heard you say that foreknowledge is
[1:06:54] first and predestination comes after
[1:06:57] foreknowledge and elections and the
[1:06:58] things involved and said I thought I
[1:07:01] finally had it figured out now you done
[1:07:02] blowed my mind because you don't want
[1:07:04] that page for knowledge why not we're
[1:07:12] here we go into the back part of God's
[1:07:14] mind by way of the Prophet messenger and
[1:07:20] why can't we see the morning Sarge we're
[1:07:23] staying together and the sons of God
[1:07:25] were shouting for joy well that was just
[1:07:29] in God's mind oh that's wonderful
[1:07:38] I gave you the quote from brother
[1:07:39] branham and got it laying here if you
[1:07:41] wanted brother Brown who said what is
[1:07:45] when the morning stars sang together
[1:07:47] under guard shot it with your he said
[1:07:48] how do you know that that would when
[1:07:49] they seen the plan of salvation would
[1:07:53] then is one thing for certain
[1:07:55] those that saw that back gar saw the
[1:07:58] plan of salvation before we ever made
[1:08:01] one step this way well you just put it
[1:08:11] out there we like these other brothers
[1:08:12] because they they come through and they
[1:08:14] say things we can understand them praise
[1:08:17] God when you think I can get them to try
[1:08:21] to help you it's about time to quit
[1:08:25] playing with sugar tits too and start
[1:08:28] believing what God says the prophet of
[1:08:34] God said it over and over you know it he
[1:08:37] said you always was eternal now what's
[1:08:41] he talking about what do you talk about
[1:08:43] always why'd he come he said you
[1:08:46] wouldn't save don't know certain day he
[1:08:49] said she was always saved did you say
[1:08:52] what I say george'll he said according
[1:08:55] to the Bible you're saved before the
[1:08:56] foundation of the world
[1:09:03] what about it church which ought to
[1:09:08] understand you you know when you say you
[1:09:11] don't understand me I know one thing for
[1:09:13] certain and you're going to like this
[1:09:17] really good you'll go ahead and boil out
[1:09:20] a little bit get it done but I'll get
[1:09:22] that patents for them where you'd go
[1:09:26] roll it up and pout it but you know the
[1:09:30] reason you don't understand me maybe
[1:09:33] it's cause you don't talk to the same
[1:09:34] God I talk to have I ever brought you
[1:09:38] anything that wasn't in the message you
[1:09:42] have a right to come and show me
[1:09:44] have I ever brought you anything that
[1:09:47] wasn't according to what the Prophet
[1:09:48] said you have a right to come and show
[1:09:51] me
[1:09:55] why would a prophet say you needed to be
[1:09:58] born again but say you always was
[1:10:00] eternal I start sensible but you know
[1:10:07] what that means
[1:10:08] I know you're gonna like it better okay
[1:10:11] you know what that means that means acts
[1:10:13] 2:38 comparable Matthew 28:19 are you
[1:10:20] listening
[1:10:21] we had Matthew 28:19 in acts 2:38 as a
[1:10:25] direct contradiction in the Bible and
[1:10:27] would not listen to being baptized the
[1:10:29] name of the Lord Jesus Christ right cold
[1:10:31] we had father-son oligo cuz everybody
[1:10:33] else that father son and holy God so
[1:10:41] when the Prophet says you need to be
[1:10:43] born again and then turned around and
[1:10:45] says you always was eternal you got a
[1:10:47] contradiction if you don't know the
[1:10:48] answer and remember you're going to talk
[1:10:54] among yourself about what I'm saying you
[1:11:00] always do instead of coming to me just
[1:11:04] remember you've got to let me sit right
[1:11:09] there and can't hear a thing did you
[1:11:12] notice the other day when I said it and
[1:11:14] I kept turning back wait called it he
[1:11:17] song kept turning back somebody was
[1:11:20] sitting our texting at the same time on
[1:11:23] your telephone now if that can be done I
[1:11:27] would think a little bit about the Word
[1:11:32] of God
[1:11:34] I'm not playing trying to build
[1:11:36] character or anything I'm trying to get
[1:11:39] you to see one thing God and had in his
[1:11:43] mind that he was going to bring his
[1:11:48] children into be you mean God had
[1:11:53] children come on are you that blind the
[1:11:59] Baptist knows God has children are you
[1:12:01] that blind
[1:12:05] who are we the only way you can be a
[1:12:14] child of God is to be born again what
[1:12:25] you see we segment but now listen what
[1:12:28] is that what would it make us be in that
[1:12:30] let's read a couple then we'll quit ok
[1:12:31] give me a few more minutes ok while are
[1:12:38] getting number six I'll quote number
[1:12:41] five to you from the message what does
[1:12:44] it take to make a Christian life God had
[1:12:48] in his mind what to do now listen but
[1:12:55] when he expressed it it had to come into
[1:13:02] existence he listened to that he had in
[1:13:09] his mind what he wanted to do but he
[1:13:13] expressed it and it come into existence
[1:13:16] okay let's just see what this would make
[1:13:20] us to be let's see number six yep and
[1:13:23] knoweth it not you talking about you've
[1:13:28] come over here in this little inside man
[1:13:30] they talk about and you how to be
[1:13:33] foreordained because you was with God
[1:13:36] you're a part of God now he's explaining
[1:13:38] a prophet in his ways of actions and
[1:13:40] doing okay our gifts and the way they
[1:13:45] operate okay
[1:13:46] he said I was in my father I was in my
[1:13:49] grandfather and my great-grandfather
[1:13:51] grandfather by seed I was in that I was
[1:13:58] in Christ you were in Christ before the
[1:14:02] foundation of the world he came to
[1:14:06] redeem his own his own that was in him
[1:14:14] hallelujah
[1:14:15] his children that was in him
[1:14:19] never he never came to save the devil's
[1:14:23] children they all know they never will
[1:14:29] know it
[1:14:30] they are so shrewd in the ways or their
[1:14:33] intellectual learning that you can't
[1:14:35] compile with them at all you cannot talk
[1:14:38] them but by faith you see it not the
[1:14:43] devil's children God didn't come to save
[1:14:45] them he come to save his own children
[1:14:51] what about it who are the ones that are
[1:14:55] going to be in this group that you're
[1:14:57] talking about
[1:14:57] go ahead number seven now who is this
[1:15:01] Melchizedek paragraph 115 look he's
[1:15:06] coming down explaining the sisal to show
[1:15:08] the germ to thing shows plainly the
[1:15:12] predestinated is the only one that's
[1:15:15] considered in Redemption Devil's
[1:15:22] children's not in redemption to impart
[1:15:25] eternal life to anybody to watch on is
[1:15:27] not Redemption that's just him giving
[1:15:31] eternal life to for some reason
[1:15:34] what the other one is considered in
[1:15:37] Redemption did you get it let me say
[1:15:39] that again the predestinate is the only
[1:15:41] one that's considered in Redemption
[1:15:43] people might be making like think they
[1:15:46] are but the real redemption is those
[1:15:49] that are predestinated because the very
[1:15:52] word redeem means to bring back is that
[1:15:57] right the redeem is something to redeem
[1:15:59] anything is bring it back to its
[1:16:01] original place hallelujah
[1:16:04] so it's only the predestinated that
[1:16:06] would be brought back because the others
[1:16:08] didn't come from dark
[1:16:13] what's the dark
[1:16:16] you got to predestinated group of people
[1:16:18] then you got something didn't come from
[1:16:20] dire they didn't come from where the
[1:16:26] predestinate people come from is that
[1:16:27] sensible right
[1:16:31] now watch what he says being eternal
[1:16:35] with him at the beginning the eternal
[1:16:38] life that you had his thought of what
[1:16:42] you was only he wanted you to he wanted
[1:16:47] me to stand the pulpit that he wanted me
[1:16:48] to sit in the seat tonight then we are
[1:16:51] serving his eternal purpose and remember
[1:17:01] it is not the person 150 for church age
[1:17:07] book we got it it's in here it's not the
[1:17:09] person that comes free that's innate
[1:17:11] eternally from God it's the word or seed
[1:17:19] not this and when you hear where he says
[1:17:23] oh that's fine we're going down to it
[1:17:25] who is this Melchizedek notice those who
[1:17:28] have tonight eternal life was with him
[1:17:31] and in him and his thinking before there
[1:17:33] ever was and for there ever was an angel
[1:17:39] sure of him anything else that's eternal
[1:17:43] you have eternal life you always was not
[1:17:47] your being here with the shape and form
[1:17:50] that the infinite God not this that's
[1:17:56] where the trouble that that's why the
[1:17:58] predestination theories are what they
[1:18:00] are
[1:18:01] that's why in the organizations that
[1:18:02] were that that's why you bad this split
[1:18:04] over predestination it wasn't just a lot
[1:18:07] of the others a Baptist doctor split
[1:18:09] with two brothers
[1:18:10] I'll come out of there two brothers
[1:18:13] split the Baptist Church over
[1:18:16] predestination
[1:18:19] we'll see what is predestination well I
[1:18:23] don't I know I'm not too good a person
[1:18:25] but if I was back there I'm
[1:18:28] predestinated backward
[1:18:36] well always was eternal see there's the
[1:18:39] problem you got the Baptist doctrine was
[1:18:42] called to seeds in the spirit
[1:18:45] that's a Baptist doctrine called to
[1:18:47] seeds in the spirit almost identical
[1:18:50] calling it two souls two seeds in the
[1:18:55] spirit that was her doctor and the
[1:18:58] people of this message what if I come
[1:18:59] with a seed in me if I come with this
[1:19:06] seed in me what seed did you come with
[1:19:13] some seed in you that the other person
[1:19:19] didn't come with a seed in them you've
[1:19:26] gotten God respect to a person now
[1:19:30] you're out you've got him a respect to a
[1:19:34] person you got any money you're out
[1:19:35] you're off the message but if you give
[1:19:39] everybody a change on this side on
[1:19:43] predestination then you can go according
[1:19:46] to predestination but I'm not talking
[1:19:49] about that we're ending this tonight
[1:19:50] bringing I'm talking about back before
[1:19:52] the foundation all this one more metric
[1:19:54] I got one more I got to bring that we
[1:19:56] were chosen in him Lord willing we'll
[1:19:58] bring Sunday we were chosen in him he
[1:20:02] chose us we didn't choose him oh I saw
[1:20:05] God I thought God the Bible says no man
[1:20:08] so God at any time but I don't
[1:20:11] understand you cuz I cryed and I done
[1:20:13] this trying to find another quote
[1:20:18] coworking the end owner you see Church
[1:20:24] all I want to be is to be a part of God
[1:20:33] is that your desire I'm as honest that I
[1:20:39] can be in straight Blaine talking I'm
[1:20:42] not interested in going to heaven I come
[1:20:48] out here about 20 30 years ago preach
[1:20:50] the sermon I said from now on
[1:20:52] I have no interest in going to heaven I
[1:20:54] said I don't mean now if I die where I'm
[1:20:57] going to want to do it I'm just trying
[1:20:59] telling you that heaven is supposed to
[1:21:01] come here according to the Bible
[1:21:04] everything comes here we don't go down
[1:21:08] if you're gonna do anything gonna meet
[1:21:11] him up in the air we're all of us here
[1:21:14] that's why this is the center of the
[1:21:16] universe is this earth cause this is
[1:21:19] where God makes his headquarters this is
[1:21:24] where the future home is going to be set
[1:21:25] in I want him to come here and see
[1:21:29] that's why I tried my best to get you
[1:21:30] for 40 years over one time your prophet
[1:21:34] said the seventh seal is the coming of
[1:21:36] the Lord that right go home and look up
[1:21:41] the word come
[1:21:49] it has nothing to do without darkness it
[1:21:53] means the word coming I can go into a
[1:21:58] lot of things with it belong but it
[1:22:00] literally means to be right here
[1:22:02] embraced in the arms of the Lord Jesus
[1:22:05] Christ then when he comes here to take
[1:22:08] our star the word come means to be here
[1:22:17] not in travel not you going it means to
[1:22:22] be here your prophet said one day
[1:22:26] they'll come such a baptism of the Holy
[1:22:28] Ghost
[1:22:29] then it'll fill every fiber of our being
[1:22:31] and take us in the rapture it's coming
[1:22:35] here he's going are you crazy listen a
[1:22:39] preacher don't go to heaven you don't
[1:22:40] even know what I say it you ain't
[1:22:43] listening you just listening to word and
[1:22:45] go ahead but think about it let me give
[1:22:52] you one more where you won't think I'm
[1:22:54] wrong on it you're a part of God that's
[1:23:00] all that I want to be okay brothers
[1:23:04] let's go to 13 eight single have jumped
[1:23:10] now I list mine and unless one two three
[1:23:13] so we're going over 13 a and it's off
[1:23:15] the message Jesus Christ the same they
[1:23:23] said that man's belly bub look when the
[1:23:25] light flash across that little
[1:23:27] predestinated see now you know he talked
[1:23:28] about the woman well the woman run come
[1:23:33] on place across that little
[1:23:35] predestinated cedar she had her seed
[1:23:39] praise God when it struck that real seat
[1:23:43] of God that was before the foundation of
[1:23:46] the world probably name was put on the
[1:23:50] Lamb's Book of Life when it struck that
[1:23:53] quickly she recognized it in her
[1:23:56] condition she recognized it really I say
[1:23:59] that woman knows more about God right
[1:24:01] then
[1:24:01] than half the people in the United
[1:24:04] States and she recognized why she was
[1:24:06] ordained before the foundation of the
[1:24:07] world when that light struck it now one
[1:24:11] minute
[1:24:12] listen when that predestinated seed was
[1:24:18] made alive to the little woman at the
[1:24:20] well did it give her eternal life right
[1:24:23] there you just read from your prophet
[1:24:30] does it was struck to life did she get
[1:24:32] eternal life no because Jesus hadn't
[1:24:36] died yet the seed was made alive of who
[1:24:42] he was come on I can say all that now if
[1:24:45] you want to to Moses when that light
[1:24:48] struck Moses it never gave him eternal
[1:24:51] life but he gave him the revelation of
[1:24:53] the one burning at the burning bush it
[1:24:59] was the I am that I am you can have the
[1:25:04] seed made alive to you of many things if
[1:25:07] the seat was made alive - - Abel it was
[1:25:12] quicker than made alive - Abel of the
[1:25:15] blood being the atonement that didn't
[1:25:19] give him eternal life see that's where
[1:25:23] you want to just run with anything you
[1:25:25] want to it didn't give that little woman
[1:25:26] at the well eternal life she had to go
[1:25:28] to Calvary she was probably in the upper
[1:25:31] room I think she was I don't see no
[1:25:33] reason why she wouldn't have been there
[1:25:37] but she never got any turn alive when
[1:25:39] that light was struck now you're reading
[1:25:41] your prophet and you listen to it he'll
[1:25:43] say that seed was laying there and the
[1:25:45] light struck it and it come to life
[1:25:47] he'll say eternal life with a woman that
[1:25:52] dwell never got eternal Island but she
[1:25:54] got to eternal life a few days later but
[1:25:59] a random said she had representation
[1:26:02] from predestination
[1:26:07] he said the Pharisees didn't have it do
[1:26:12] you understand
[1:26:15] making just that point that we think
[1:26:18] because it was struck whether I gave you
[1:26:20] all these copper red atoms said Moses
[1:26:23] was struck a lot Amen but it never gave
[1:26:26] him eternal eyes because you've got
[1:26:29] eternal life in people before Calvary
[1:26:31] and you can't have it except to one man
[1:26:34] Adam will cover him Sunday good Adam did
[1:26:37] have eternal life that was God's program
[1:26:38] and God's ordained way it should have
[1:26:41] come okay we'll leave that alone okay so
[1:26:45] look what he says now going to the Nexen
[1:26:50] 13b going to 13b and he you're supposed
[1:26:58] to hit it still on its on Christ miss
[1:27:02] your God reveal you can't commit
[1:27:04] adultery you're already pregnant what's
[1:27:06] he talking about the new birth right
[1:27:09] glory you can't take it hold the wound
[1:27:13] of life is close to anything else
[1:27:15] you're already here's my predestination
[1:27:17] that seed has come to life no world can
[1:27:21] get it oh how we'd like to stay on this
[1:27:24] for about an hour I'm sure you
[1:27:26] understand see Christ and his alone
[1:27:29] already finished the seed was there the
[1:27:33] seed was already
[1:27:36] when was it foot died before the
[1:27:40] foundation of the world has
[1:27:44] predestinated us unto eternal life and
[1:27:47] as soon as the life-giving flow that
[1:27:50] seed laying down other seeds
[1:27:55] it won't take hold where we succeed
[1:28:00] puttin you before the foundation world
[1:28:03] not in predestination you're gonna have
[1:28:06] to back up into the God's mind
[1:28:07] or else you're gonna have him choosing
[1:28:09] come on now I'm saying that come on
[1:28:11] listen if you say well that was just
[1:28:14] back before the foundation world when in
[1:28:16] God's mind he was rolling doing it then
[1:28:18] you're having him choosing because he's
[1:28:19] speaking out we want you say well you
[1:28:24] sure sound like you're choosing no I'm
[1:28:26] not
[1:28:27] there was no choosing to that seed the
[1:28:31] seeds is what comes predestinate
[1:28:33] eternally from God
[1:28:34] there's no choosing on the seed you
[1:28:36] didn't choose to receive a seed when it
[1:28:40] says there in the beginning what I'll
[1:28:44] put enmity between thy seed and the seed
[1:28:45] of the woman that seed was Jesus Christ
[1:28:51] okay one more
[1:28:52] come on decisions one more crisis a
[1:28:57] mystery of garden let's see now we're on
[1:28:58] microscopy go to the next one which
[1:29:00] would be 13b my cry sneaker see the seed
[1:29:06] of God is actually placed in us from the
[1:29:09] foundation of the world and when that
[1:29:11] light strike first strikes that seed it
[1:29:14] brings its life
[1:29:15] the Verte the light first has to come
[1:29:18] upon the seat okay now listen if it was
[1:29:25] put there before the foundation of the
[1:29:27] world
[1:29:28] then the Bible's right when it said the
[1:29:31] morning stars sang together the sons of
[1:29:32] God shouted for joy then the Bible is
[1:29:36] right when it says the things were
[1:29:38] written in the book of the life of the
[1:29:40] lamb slain before the foundation of the
[1:29:41] world now you going on back into the
[1:29:44] mind of God and we'll take a pickup
[1:29:46] Sunday where it says we were chosen in
[1:29:49] him it's not whether or not I've been
[1:29:58] chosen it matters because my goodness
[1:30:03] can't put me into heaven but it's
[1:30:11] according if he was chosen we say well
[1:30:15] we know for sure he will be that's right
[1:30:18] if he was chosen we were children
[1:30:21] you ain't never listened to the Prophet
[1:30:23] when he'd say when he walked the shores
[1:30:26] of Galilee I was in him said when he
[1:30:32] went to Calvary I was in
[1:30:36] said when he went to hell I was in he
[1:30:39] said when he raised I raised in him not
[1:30:44] important what that we think of
[1:30:47] predestination the importance is whether
[1:30:49] or not he chose us
[1:30:51] you said yeah I accepted God I accepted
[1:30:55] God that was one that really told me you
[1:30:57] know the quote I'm going to run around
[1:30:59] him later statement he said you accept
[1:31:02] he'd gone that's right he said but did
[1:31:04] God accept you well wait he said if I'd
[1:31:10] repent and I believe and be baptized and
[1:31:12] he saved me
[1:31:13] yeah and then you go back live like a
[1:31:17] devil proven it's a long way it goes to
[1:31:21] show he didn't accept you you might have
[1:31:24] accepted him but he didn't accept you
[1:31:25] but when you accept you he's gonna come
[1:31:28] and live in you and when he comes and
[1:31:30] lives in you you ain't gon live like a
[1:31:31] devil right so we're gonna try to find
[1:31:38] now to get out of heaven but I hope you
[1:31:41] understand he didn't listen to the
[1:31:43] message tonight I got the quotes are
[1:31:47] laying the Prophet said if you wasn't in
[1:31:50] him before the foundation the world you
[1:31:52] never will be but said if you was in him
[1:31:56] they ain't enough for Devils inhale to
[1:31:59] stop you what about it then go ahead
