at Brother Ray Ericson's Church in in Ohio so we really appreciate him coming and being with us he poured his heart out last night he's got a little bit left and he's going to let you have it tonight so just settle back pull on the gift I know one thing's for sure by the people that I've talked to on ly and here in this building last night he walked down your aisle amen several people have told us the different things that they were going through that he had no idea that's the God we serve that's right that knows your need before you even get here and brother Wayne don't have to know it the Holy Ghost has got to know it he just yields himself and gets out of the way so the Lord can speak and speak to your heart so let's sing Open the Eyes of My Heart as our brother comes the Eyes of My Heart Lord Open the Eyes of My Heart I want to [Music] see oh I want to [Music] see well Open the Eyes of My Heart Lord Open the Eyes of My Heart I want to see you oh Jesus I want to see you to see you high lifted up shining in the of your glory pour out of power and love as we sing Holy Holy Holy high and lifted up oh shining in the light of your glory and pour out your power and love as we sing Holy Holy [Music] Holy Holy Holy Holy You Are Holy holy holy holy holy holy holy I want to see you amen amen God bless you all tonight it's it's a real honor to be here and uh we trust that you've come to Amen to Worship the Lord and to entertain the presence of the Angel the Lord let him come by your way and amen it's certainly good to see this Scott family and brother and sister Tatum and God bless you folks amen they're good friends and we certainly have been blessed through the years with their friendship and you know um I don't usually mention things like this but middle of that Co it a little tough on the Evangelist you know that was just almost complet traveling and I hadn't heard from Brother Ed and almost a year went out to the mailbox one day and there was something from them and tell me they was praying for us and just want to help us get through those times and and uh we certainly appreciate what they' done and say God bless you and amen to all of you and and uh our friends here brother uh our sister Colin someone told me would got to be here tonight with us and we want to say God bless you sis it's been a few years since we saw you all and amen U we we trust the Lord will bless you tonight in a special way and amen to be able to be here and be a part of the meeting see you all come out together it sure blesses our hearts um Brother Sam God bless you and thank you for the open door to be here tonight and Amen brother Wade and his family I just want to say that it's it's an honor to speak to what I believe is the cream of the crop the Bride of Jesus Christ I I think it's the greatest privilege that a man could ever be given and brother randam said it he said you know he said if we had a charger of the blood of Jesus he said how we would handle it he said but God gave that blood BL to purchase this people so this people is more precious to God than his own blood so I think we ought to think about the preciousness and the value that God has placed into you and amen and uh so it it was a tremendous time last night to speak with you and if you're first time being here tonight we say God bless you and uh and uh we're just going to go into a few things here that's on her heart and it would it be okay if I just kind of relax and preach to you a little while and let the holy SP Spirit lead us down some paths and amen there's some things on our heart and uh so I just want to maybe take a few minutes in it this is a Saturday night so I don't want you to think that I'm um that I'm confused on what day it is but I want to preach to you tonight a little thought that I had been on uh it's Sunday again uh for about three or four Sundays I walked in our church and said it's Sunday again so everybody got got to laughing at me cuz it's Sunday again but you know uh I'm not not actually talking about Su n d a y I'm talking about s o n d a y it's Sunday again let's go into the Bible tonight amen we're going to go into Mark the 16th chapter uh if you have your Bibles and sometimes I like to do this and please don't think I'm superstitious but I like to open a Bible and then pray uh I like to pray about that open word amen let's just bow our hearts now gracious father we thank you tonight for the word that has been opened and Lord we open the pages of the Bible but Lord it would take you to open the content to break the scripture Lord to your children and Lord late in the evening on the third day you took two aside and the Bible said you broke the bread Lord and they recognized it was you Lord when they went to tell their friends about meeting you the Bible said you appeared again among them and Lord they was lift with a message that you would meet with them and Lord here we are today in this hour where a prophet has been told by the angel the Lord I'll meet you in there and Lord we know this is the meeting place when your word begins to open to the heart of your children that's where you meet them and I ask you tonight as we invite you into this place on this Saturday evening the last evening of a calendar year and Lord I ask you that your mercy would just come into this building may you take a may you take a mind of a man and may you set it aside and may you take the gift which you've deposited and use it Lord For Your Glory I ask you that the Holy Ghost would just come in this room tonight and speak to the need of your children father that Supernatural words would be spoken to your people and father as we would charge the enemy to back away from your children I pray PR father the Holy Spirit would come and it would bind the Brokenhearted Lord it would Open the Eyes Lord of the Blind and I ask you father that your mercy would just take the room now as we commit this meeting into thy faithful hands in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen and amen and God bless you and we want to look at Mark the 16th chapter if we can and I want to read here uh from Mark 16 and verse 2 Mark 16 and verse 2 and very early in the morning the first day of the week there came under the SRE at the rising of the sun now these will be the texts brother brand used for the message the rising of the Sun but if you notice it says very early in the morning the first day of the week until about 3:21 ad what we call Sunday now was known as the first day of the week but in Constantine gave it the name Sunday which it was a Roman word Sunday all right now if we go to Romans uh the e8th chapter in the 11th verse brother bram's going to use this in uh also he uses Revelations 1118 we'll not go there tonight but he it's a powerful scripture but Romans 8 and verse 11 but if the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised Christ from the dead shall also Quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in you Romans 8:11 now if we go to Luke 17 and3 for even thus shall it be in the day when the son of man is revealed in the day when the son of man is revealed God bless you you could be seated tonight we want to speak to you uh concerning this scripture it's Sunday again and in saying that um I know uh that the prophet will actually uh speak to us uh the Church of the Living God from the message of rising of the Sun and in this uh rising of the sun brother brandom is speaking to us about quickening power he's talking about what it causes to make us alive what what would what would resurrect us or make us alive and in doing so uh brother brandom was uh he he he's uh he's a powerful preacher and he has a way of saying things that are so simple that most of the time uh the average person will look over it and think well there's nothing to it but then if you go back and you just saturate it and listen to it and watch it that it it has something in it uh that is very much concerning the church now uh if you're if you're reading and and follow along with brother brandom of course brother brandom will take take us in uh and I'll I'll skip the first part of the rising of the sun where he talks about uh what the power of the sun and the seeds and things but it it he comes to a certain point and then he begins to read uh the scripture concerning the first fruits of the Book of Leviticus and brother B said I have a scripture here that I think uh he said I'd like that you to turn there and I wrote it down he said I think it might help you a little bit I found it in the Book of Leviticus if you want to turn Leviticus 23 and9 amen uh he said now listen close in the levitical law God is speaking to Moses saying and all these things are a type now and we'll stop here for a moment in this type so brother ramam is reading this Leviticus 23:9 to11 and he's re he's reading it for a type now if let's read it uh together and the Lord spake unto Moses saying Speak unto the children of Israel saying unto them when you come into the land which I give you and you shall reap the Harvest thereof then you shall bring a sheath of the first fruits of your Harvest un the priest and he shall wave the Sheep before the Lord to be accepted now watch the scripture on the tomorrow after the Sabbath the priest shall wave it so it's on the first day the priest shall wave it so he's getting into a levitical law where Moses is talking about that that the children of Israel was going to come into a place or under a land and brother bam is saying that it's a tight in other words they're going to come into a Promised Land I'm going to read paragraph 82 and brother B says of course he says see under the place and brother B's going to replace the word he said un a place or un a position that I have given unto you now you speak to the children of Israel that when you get to this certain place that I have promised you that i' take you to when you get there in that land now speaking natural here but it's typing the spiritual and you show reap the Harvest thereof that's the scripture he said when you get to this place and you shall reap the Harvest thereof but brother brandom says it like this you have received what I have told you in that place in other words God said you're going to go into a place but then you're going to receive something in that place and when you get there and you receive that then you should bring a sheath of the first fruits of your Harvest under the priest and he shall wave it before the Lord to be accepted tomorrow after the Sabbath now of course when brother bam speaks of this he tells us in the adoption he tells us that we are not going to a natural land but we're going to a spiritual land so the Church of the Living God like Moses brought them out of Egypt and then God LED them into a land Moses told them on the way you're going to a certain place and when you get into that place it'll be a land and there's certain things that'll be there and brother bam is saying now God has given the church a land and then when you get in that land there will be things in that land and when you reap the Harvest or you get the things that I told you was going to be there then you're going to give us a sheath waving and it will be on the first day of the week now this promise has been given to the church is a spiritual promise that's why uh that you know if you think about uh Israel a lot of people will say well Israel is a Promised Land it was because God promised him the land that's that's why it's a Promised Land because God promised them he promised Abraham you can have this land and the reason that the spiritual land of the church is considered a promised land is because God made the promise that we could come to this place or this position in other words we have been predestinated unto a certain position that God has made us now of course in in Joshua chapter 6 you see that it was God that told Joshua that he had given him this land now if you if you study the Book of Joshua of course it came to a certain point that after the death of Moses then there therefore he said arise and go over this Jordan and all of this people under the land which I did give them even to the children of Israel so there come a point in the journey where they were no longer coming out they were no longer journeying they were no longer in the wilderness they were no longer in the land of that they were they were living but what they were living in didn't belong to them they couldn't build permanent dwellings they couldn't build Vineyards they couldn't dig Wells they couldn't claim the property they were because none of it belonged to them they were only journeying through amen but then God finally told them you need to arise and go into this land that I have given thee now when God got ready for them to go in that land it was a it was the it was a certain season now I think it's powerful to acknowledge that God has seasons and in the seasons of God when he tells you to go a certain way or do a certain thing God is God enough to back that up and make a way where there just is no way for you to enter into the place that he told you could go amen when God got ready to send Joshua over brother Bram said it looked like he would have sent him at a different time but he sent him in the spring of the year and when he s him over brother Bram says the Bible of course says that the Jordan was overflowing during that time would have looked like if you was going to cross the Jordan you would have done it at a better time but see God chooses impossible times to prove that he is a God who can rule the impossible situation and make it possible that it would take a supernatural experience to get where they were going it was because God was doing the leading and and you know when they come up to the Jordan of course the latter rains were falling right we're talking about the harvest season we're talking about the spring of the year so the Jordan was full of the latter rain amen the rain falling and and and as it falls how many you ever been around the mountains when it rains in the mountains it melts the snow and the rivers run full with snow melts so you had a double thing going you had the rains falling the latter rain the Harvest rain falling on the snow and it was filling up the rivers and the and the thing was running full and that's the time God decides that Joshua is going to go over the river but see it doesn't matter whether we think it's a good idea or not but when God says get up and go over this land you can get up and go into that land and God was sending them into that land now the Bible tells us how they were going to do it of course they were getting ready to go and God told them to tell the to tell the Levites put the word on your put the word upon your shoulders and just begin to go over this land now when you get to the place that you come up to that River the Bible tells us that when their priest put their foot in the river amen that the Bible says that the waters parted and it and it went into dry land and God was able then see to open up a place to go into something he had made a promise to them amen I hate to stop for a minute but is this might cutting in and out there or is it just in my ear it's just in my ear is it is it steady out there okay amen I've got a I've got a in and out in and out of whoever's on the sound it's it's clipping a lot so I don't know if you need to run the scanner or what but you see what it is is is God allows them to go through that promised land and as they as they enter in there it was in a supernatural time but God see wared to Mark the season they were going in so he actually tells Joshua to mark it in other words don't just let this happen but I want to I I want to make a memorial of of the passing of this time so then he commands them to stack the stones and you know the story amen that he was able to stack the stones now if you're if you're a Bible reader there was actually two different Stacks there was a stack that was on the bank and then there was a stack in the river because he wanted them to stack Stones exactly where the priest had stood where the waters were supposed to be but they were there no longer so those stones were stones of Memorial of their Crossing so if you were walking with your son years later and you seen the top of a pile of stones somebody said what's them Stones piled in the river well that was where the priest stood how did the priest stand there well see God opened up the river right here in this part but if the river was high there was a pile of stones that was on the land over near geal and the Bible tells us that they were there for a memorial so they could all always see the stones now it's a powerful thing to me because I I I I you know if you read history we actually been right there with those stones were stacked but they believe that's the very same place that John the Baptist baptized Jesus and of course when Jesus was being baptized y'all remember John's sermon he said God's able these stones to rise children un Abraham so he was there proving that the supernatural God is able to do things Amen in impossible situations he is able to raise people amen who were not people but he should make them the people of God God is able to take someone amen and raise them up to fulfill the promises that he has made for a certain generation of course them 12 Stones laid there in gilgal and it was a place of the crossing and the times now it's a it's a powerful uh uh significant thing to me to recognize the season that they crossed over and in Joshua 4: 19 it actually records that it was the 10th day of the first month and they encamped in gilgal I think it's powerful amen The Crossing happens in the 10th in the in the in the 10th day of the first month now if you study the Passover you know Israel's calendar amen it starts in in the in the first month but the first month is actually the Passover or Easter time and the and the seventh month is actually September September is amen but it's it's a it's built off of the moons so when they say the the the 10th day of the first month it's in the spring of the year and the Passover season amen now it's a powerful thing to me that that God chose this same time to bring them into the promise as when he brought them out in The Exodus under Moses remember Exodus chap 12 when Moses went down to deliver the children of Israel out of Egypt amen it the Bible records that they was to do a Passover and when they were going to have a Passover it was to be done on the 10th day of the first month amen and and so they were they were coming into Passover now you all know the word Passover amen is that God was going to pass through Egypt and he was going to execute judgment upon the gods of Egypt amen I know y'all probably all studied this out good but it's a powerful study amen that there's there's 10 different major deities that was in Egypt during that time so when God be to exercise a power over Egypt Egypt that God was exercising power over every deity that they had to show he was the god that could exercise judgment over the deities of Egypt so as that they would realize there's only one true God and that was the god of Israel this unseen God and he had great power with him and and and we find out that God was going to execute judgment he said but but he sent Moses in there to tell the people amen that if you will put blood on your door y'all know that Bren amen you put that blood on that door that I will pass over your house but I'm going to pass through Egypt and I thank God tonight for the Passover that there was a lamb brother man said they kept it up 14 days before they could show it but he said there's your ages right there that 14 days watching that lamb but sooner or later amen you couldn't use the lamb you had to use the life of the Lamb is that right look at the mystery laying there amen when the death angel come under the last plague which was spiritual death and brother B said that's the last plague striking the church spiritual death amen but when that plague came they didn't have the lamb they had the life of the Lamb which was displayed in the blood it was the token the Corporal body was hid in the house but the life was displayed amen showing us that in the season we're living in that the Corporal body of Jesus would be in the heavens but the literal life of the blood the baptism of the spirit would be back upon the church amen that would protect us from the death plague that was falling upon Egypt during that time amen it was a beautiful time and anybody that's ever read Exodus chap 12 if you've ever listened to many theological ideas or you study any of the in the circular Realms everybody's always talking about New Beginnings New Beginnings well New Beginnings is Passover amen and the reason is because God spoke to Moses in Exodus 12 and he said when God began to speak to him he said let it be a beginning of months unto you in other words that God could come in the middle of the year and say the first month just started God can come whenever God speaks to a man things start over again and listen God can start right in the middle of situations and start things over again I know I know what I'm talking about well God can't take God can't change things but every time you write a check every time you you sign a name and date the date you write down you write 2022 or now it's going to be 2023 and why is it 2022 or 23 it's after the death of Christ and it's before the death of Christ so he he is a dispensational motion that breaks up the channels of time of how you count time is before and after Christ and you see your life amen there's a before Christ and there's an after Christ and when God comes into a life it brings a new beginning into that life and I thank God tonight that there's a memorial a new beginning of coming out and there's a beginning of going in amen look what God done to that new generation when he took them over in the Book of Joshua he recircumcised the entire generation that was born during that time I pray we get the knives out again and circumcise the children of God that the power of the Holy Ghost can return in the church and the and the reproach of Egypt will be rolled off of our young people amen that the power of God can refill the church with anointing and Truth Amen to bring this generation to everything that God has promised them to become to I think it's powerful there can be a new beginning I mean I I let me shock you I don't believe in second chances amen I don't believe in second chances somebody well he don't believe in second chances no I don't I believe in third chances and four chances and fifth chances and six chances and seven chances I believe no matter what chance number you're counting when God gets ready to change a matter he can change it in the moment he can change it in the in the very time you say how can God do it I'll tell you how he done it he took a lamb and if you got the lamb that I got Christ is my Passover Lamb and his blood has the power to change your life or your situation it don't matter how dirty listen I tell you what I've got I've got the Fuller soap I've got a blood that can clean the Fest sinner I've got a blood that can clean up any life I got a blood that can change any man he can clean up a dop adic he can clean up an alcoholic he can take anybody and change them listen I'm a witness tonight he can take a man who's lost and undone and fill him with the Holy Ghost and put him in a platform to preach the Gospel of Jesus Christ as a testimony that he can raise a man up because God is able these stones to rise children under Abraham I'm talking about a real God I'm not talking about a second-handed God I'm not talking about the third God of some Trinity I'm talking about the God that created the heavens in the Earth had come right down into a life and give a man A New Beginning have you ever wanted to start over well let me tell you what a man can start over with God yes sir I believe it I believe a man can start over with God somebody say well brother Wayne Amen I don't I I don't know about that stuff let me tell you what amen youall know that's barley Harvest amen scripturally that's barley Harvest amen that's barley Harvest and if you're reading your Bible that's exactly when Ruth came in Amen to Jerusalem Ruth came excuse me to Bethlehem when Ruth came into Bethlehem it was in the season of barley Harvest it was a Passover season it was a season of new beginnings she was an idolatrous she was worshiping Heathen Gods amen but her old husband died and God was going to give her a new husband to bring forth the seed of the tribe of Judah and God had a season to bring them in and God's got a season for you and God's got a season for your children and I say this is the season God has marked the season he spoke to a prophet sent him among the church he preached a token message and he changed the dispensation oh brother let me tell you what the prophet of God said from this time and this time forward he said They Crucified the word and the no longer a place of worship and When They Crucified the word he said from this time it's the word and the word only I do not have to humble myself to denominations I don't hear to hear what the denomination thinks about me whatever a prophet said is exactly what God has for us in this hour we are under a prophetic word the dispensation of God the time of new beginnings amen we didn't even have a Roman word Sunday but we have the first day of the week amen brother bam tells us this he said that Sabbath day is a seventh day but he said but which we call Sunday he said but a Roman word they call it Sunday Son of God but oh how it's changed it's not Su n anymore it's s o n d a y something changed now something's changed what is it brother Ram tells us this he said see it's a change something changed the day of the week something moved us from Saturday to Sunday my goodness I don't know about y'all but you can't find eight days on the calendar you ain't eight days on the calendar people said to me how do you put eight days you can't find it on the calendar cuz it ain't on the calendar it's back to the first day again it's the first day of the week amen what is the rising of the son the prophet of God said it's the first corn of wheat that raised from the dead it was God's first corn of Wheat and by quickening power God quickened his life and raised him from the dead and the first fruits of those that slept he was the sheath and that's what had to wave is the she for it was the first one to come to maturity it was waved as a memorial or Thanksgiving to God it was a sign believing that the rest of them would come said preacher what are you talking about when they come in that land after Joshua after they crossed after they come in the land do you know the first battle they fight is the walls of Jericho and they do it down at gilgal which is so close to the crossing but if you go back and study it before they fight the Battle of Jericho they have a feast and they eat of the Corn of the land you know what they were feeding on come on church under the under the Wilderness Journey there was Mana falling out of heaven but the Revival change now and they're not F they're not feasting out of Mana Out of Heaven now they're eating out of the Corn of the land now I don't know some people say brother Wayne what in the world are you talking about I tell you what I'm talking about amen we're not just feeding out of the church messages anymore amen this ain't just a this ain't just a passing time but God had promised us 2,000 years years ago even 2600 years ago through Malachi that there would come an Elijah Ministry in the last day and restore the word of Truth John told us that God would reveal the mysteries of the entire Bible in the in the end time amen Daniel said the book would be opened up that God would reveal the word so you and I are not just feeding from Men's ideas about this Bible now I hope you're hear me tonight men have held this Bible for 2,000 years and they have told told you what they believe it means but in the end time the lamb took his own word and the lamb has declared what the Bible means we are not feasting on the church ages we are feasting on the word of the son of man that is coming to this age he said preacher what are you talking about I'm talking about feasting on the fruit of the message you ever think about what Joshua ate before he met the angel of the Lord and took down the walls of Jericho something changed his attitude ude my goodness his diet changed and it his battle changed have you ever thought about it he moved from a defensive battle to an offensive battle he moved from running from Egyptians to defeating the Jericho he he it was a different battle amen amen we we we had a new beginning it's a different land now we're not running because it's a I'll tell a story y'all going to think I'm crazy man Jo me and Joel fory got this in common hey man I'm I'm a scaredy cat might as well tell you I'll just tell you up I'm a scaredy cat when it turns dark I want to be in the house with the light on I was 40 years old before I let my wife shut the light out I was proud of myself when it finally happened I can sleep by myself in the hotel room these days you know you said preacher what are you talking about one time I was in albian Pennsylvania now now they don't believe me but it's the truth they got a haunted house up there there brother it's haunted ain't it it's haunted people turn lights on all night dishes rattle in there stuff move the last time that I was in that house the last time I was in that house I come home from a meeting preaching for them I think it was a Wednesday night and I walked in the bedroom and there's three lights about this big round swirling on the wall and I went over and I looked outside there ain't nothing out there I man I looked around the room is there any reflection there ain't no reflection and I turned back and they still there they're just swirling on the wall I've been in the presence of God a lot of times in my life that had nothing to do with my God you know what I did I told them Devils I said y'all give me five minutes I'm going to pack my bags I'm going to go this house don't belong to me you can have it you can have it and I packed my bags and I was in North Carolina but morning I said they can have it it don't belong to me but if I go to my house and them saying Devils is on the wall it's a different thing brother I got grandbabies I got children amen it's a different attitude this is my house you got to go amen and that's what happened to Joshua when he realized amen this is my land God gave it to me the walls have got to come down have you ever thought about why them walls came down really amen I was studying one day I thought it was powerful I'll share it and you don't have to take it if you don't like it but I liked it amen I was studying and found out that brother random said when the Jubilee trumpet sounded he said you had to come out of the wall cities he said because you couldn't redeem anything in the wall City it was actually a law if the wall city was built the houses couldn't be redeemed out of it so they had to come out of the wall City to be redeemed but you know when God sent Messengers into Rahab the Harlot you remember the walls were on the city so she couldn't come out under the Jubilee she couldn't come out under it but look at what God done he sent Joshua in there and walk down the walls of Jericho so God said if you can't come out of it I'll tear the wall down to get you out of it because she was the property of almighty God y'all know what y'all know why she was the property don't she she hung that red ribbon out of the wall I wonder where they got that Revelation I wonder where they figured out a token would separate amen a woman from the rest of the city they knew that God separated Israel from Egypt he could separate Israel's cattle from Egypt's cattle he could separate the first born from Egypt's first born it's God that done the separated and identified them and that same God identified Rahab and it was God's Property so God just tore the walls down let me tell you what you'll never do you'll never wall this bride up you'll never do it amen you can put her behind the wall but if she can't come out God will just tear the thing down and bring Grace into those lives amen I tell you what God's going to come get his own and when these men come into that land and they found that corn God said I'll tell you what there's a memorial I want you to do I want you to wave a sheath offering now I'm not going to give him the sheath waving tonight how many's heard the sheath waving raise your hand if you know the sheath waving see I don't have to cover it you know what I'm talking about amen there was a sheath waving to be waved he said that waving of that sheath Pro showed maturity had come put the seed in the ground the same thing come out of the ground showing God's process works God's process works death burial and Resurrection I can bury it it can die I can resurrect it and have the same thing that went down and it could come back again and when it returned in the resurrection God would make them wave it to the people what went down has come back again God has the power if you lay down the life he can raise it up again amen I tell you tonight that's exact ly the Revelation that was laying there that when Christ went into the grave and he rose on the third day it wasn't somebody else com out of that grave it wasn't somebody else come out of there but Jesus was dead brother man said he was so dead remember that he said but when he come on the third day he had risen from the dead right that's why he had to be waved because he had returned exactly what went down had returned again I tell you it's a powerful thing but where it's real powerful is when brother bradam turns it to our day and he says now the same thing that went down in the book of Acts has got to return in the last day hey can I announce something to y'all the bride ain't coming she's here can I say something to you the alpha has become the Omega it's a declared word it's a definitive Revelation it don't need talked about and wondering where it's true or not absolutely it's true whether you think about it whether you feel about that about yourself I tell you God said the alpha has become the Omega then I say the alpha has become the Omega preacher what are you talking about I tell you wouldn't it be the master that tells you when the Masterpiece is done you think whatever you want to about the work but the one who designed it when he says it's finished it's finished said preacher what are you saying brother Ram said Michelangelo hit the hit the image he said and said speak he said that when he holled speak it was a proof that he had so matched his mind he thought it ought to talk and brother B said when the bride was smitten out of leard De seea he said see it was a sign that the church was finished come on church amen it was finished no matter what you think about me a prophet of God says it's a perfect Masterpiece of the original image that God had in his mind God restored Michelangelo couldn't put the peace back but God put the peace back and now the Church of the Living God is exactly where it's supposed to be the word that went down is the same word that has returned brother bam didn't have to take one thing out of Jesus Christ to present him to you wouldn't it be something amen the same God that could cause the same R to return next year he's the same God that could cause Christ to return in the same form that he went down now the prophet of God said when that happens it's got to be waved over the people now we know that the we know the sheath waving we know that is Christ we recognize we're waving Christ over the people right it's Christ that was went down it's Christ that returns we're waving Christ over the people but the thing about it is is Christ has to become flesh so people all the time ask me so well was the Sheep waving was it brother brandom or was it Christ it was both brother brandom said when I spoke them squ worlds he said see he said God was using my lips see God had to have flesh God had to take on a body and show the maturity of the church before it could be a sheath waving he waved a sheath that the word again is waved over the people the Dead traditions of man is dead the Son of God is alive with the baptism of the spirit right Among Us given us life and y'all amen I I just have to say this as clearly as I know how to say it William brandham was not a bragard there was a lot of things happened William brandham never told you about but why did he tell you about hady right why did he do it because it had to be waved over the people they had to know there was an anointing on the earth come on Church a prophet went and told a little room about creating squirrels now I know everybody thinks they wish they could create squirrels but go ahead and tell congregation you did it one time for me you think oh oh it'll make me a big guy no it'll make them look at you like you're crazy I've had Supernatural experiences happen and think man I can't wait to go tell somebody about it and when you start telling it you can see it in their eyes and you think ah never mind just never mind never mind amen because all of a sudden either you're bragging on yourself or you're making it up that's the way people think that's right so can you imagine brother brandom telling the story of creating the squirrels and he said even a man was sitting there who had had made something out of it he didn't he said and when he put it the way it was he said have you right said to him brother brandom he she said how did that happen he said had all I can tell you is the same Jehovah Gyra that was over there with Abraham on that mountain is the same Jehovah Gyra that produced that squirrel in those woods and she said It Ain't Nothing But The Truth Listen do you know what brother Ram said about that he said there was a greater anointing oin in came out then than when he created the squirrel it was a greater anointing when she agreed with a message than when it created the squirrel you said brother Wayne what are you trying to get at I'm saying that when this message was preached back there in the 1960s it was an anointing on it but when the Bride of the last days begin to catch the revelation of this message there will be a greater anointing sweep this Earth and change our body in the moment in the twinkle of an eye the anointing of God is not for another day it's for this day it's for this hour it's for this time and when she recognized she was in The Presence of Jehovah Gyra she said it ain't nothing but the truth I tell you it's a powerful thing and brother BR said he turned around and said to her now what do you have let's wave it amen it can be done what will you get out of it come on what if he waved it what did it mean to you it meant you can too it meant that God has not just sent this for brother brandom he sent it for the church to be identified in the power of his word and look at what she done she claimed my goodness too much too much too much amen you know what she did she claimed them children I'm going to ask you why she did that what she' been eating caused her to speak a certain thing brother brandom said she could have said give me a million dollars he said have been on the table he could she could have said let my sister Edith walk and she would have got up and walked so she wasn't after a Prosperity Gospel and she wasn't just consumed with Divine Healing he said or she would have not thought it was a Revival when that Soul was saved but because she had been feeding from the Tree of Life the fruit that was in her mouth was the word of life and she said give me the life of them two boys listen I'll tell you what there's no greater Paradox there's no greater power upon the Earth than one that could change the soul of a mortal man from time element to Eternal from Mortal to immortality don't you water this message down just a Pentecostal idea amen this message is the power of God the Salvation that'll change a life and a soul and a heart this message has power it has anointing it has truth it'll change lives it'll change bodies come on church if it'll change a soul it'll change the way live if it'll change your soul it'll change the way you're dress it'll change the way you're dress it'll change the way you talk it'll change the way you walk are you hearing me it didn't just Quicken the soul but it also quickened the body so preacher what are you talking about I'm talking about the bride coming of Christ that's what I'm talking about in Rise of the Sun the prophet of God said that Christ was the first one to raise from the prophets and so forth and tyed in many places he was the first fruits of them that slept and in the bride coming of Christ I've known a lot of people that don't want me to read that quote goad is it okay does that offend you in the bride coming of Christ I tell you what it don't offend that bride but it sure sets that devil mad that's Satan's having a temp potential brother said let him have all the temper tantrum he wants to have he said cuz this bride is already glorified in the presence of God there ain't nothing the devil could tell God he didn't know about you that's why you need the blood that's why you need the power of God to answer the sin question that was upon your life but if God chose you for the job God provided a way to put you in the job to cleanse your life amen in the bride coming of Christ the coming out of the church there don't have to be a sheath wave so we've seen brother brand wom we've seen him wave it creation of squirrels spoken word over had his children we've seen him wave it the resurrection of a little fish the power of the spoken word to put a storm back what was he doing he was waving that the same one that had been on the earth 2,000 years ago was not in Jerusalem he was back in the body of the Bride of Jesus Christ I challenge you to believe that the son of man is revealed in the form of the Bride in the last days I believe it with all my heart brother I me I believe it with everything that's in me that there is a bride somewhere has been churches and churches and brides and Brides but there's got to come one there's got to come one it's a vision that God has had of this generation you know I'm quoting a prophet I challenge you you go look that one up amen what is it it's the bright coming of Christ and the last day it's the waving of a sheath I'm sure you see what I'm talking about it was waved over the people and for the first time that will come forth for a bright age for a resurrection out of dark denom ationalism there will be a message the full maturity of the word has turned again into power and waved over the people my goodness to bring a resurrection in the bride this message is to resurrect the Bride come on church I'm not talking about just physical Resurrection I challenge you to listen to the rise of the sun William Brandon was not talking about physical Resurrection the entire time he's talking about a spiritual Resurrection in the church of course we believe the dead will rais of course we believe there'll be a meeting all believers believe that amen but a prophet was bringing the Revelation that there would be a spiritual Resurrection among the people that the same thing that was in the first of the Bible would be in the end of the Bible and the church would be restored to its original order and its original place a resurrection out of D dark denominationalism there'll be a bride amen I'll tell you what you can preach a whole message right here a bride with a message now that's powerful I know they're trying to set down our preachers but I say this for the first time preachers got something to preach I know it's Revival hour for the church but it's Revival hour for the devil too ain't it he's got new material he's trying to pervert this message but somebody's going to stay with it somebody's going to stay with it it's for a resurrection out of dark denomination you still your Bibles with you look in John chapter 14 and read do you have it you can put it up John 14: 19 John 14: 19 put that up for us right quick John 14 and verse 19 brother bam in the rise of the sun paragraph 97 he said because I live ye live also because I live you look where he's quoting it from because I live you also speaking to his wife right because I live ye live also what a resurrection that was what a resurrection this is now look you got two resurrections you got a resurrection of Jesus you got a resurrection of the Bride now look at the power of this because there's two resurrections watch yet a little while the world seeth me no more but you shall see me because I live Resurrection number one ye shall live also Resurrection number two what a resurrection that was I live what a resurrection this is ye live he lives you live two resurrections Resurrection it was resurrection that it is so brother random is showing that he made us alive by the quickening power that's how we're alive we're alive by quickening power amen it changed us from denomination to the word amen I'm going to stand and rise in the Sun a minute paragraph 64 and because I live and ye live also and I live in you and the works that I do identify myself what a message no wonder we've had a dark world of theology but in the evening time there shall come a light now is in Luke amen now he's over there in the book of Zechariah in that day Luke 17 in that day what day are we talking about Sunday in that day after the seventh the first day of the week again we'll go back to this same thing in the evening time there will come a light look it so Sunday is an evening message it's a power thought now the third day had a morning and an evening right in the morning was a rumor Pentecost he's alive in the evening was the proof of the Resurrection in the little room what it because I live you live also the works that I do will identify what a message no wonder we had a dark world of theology but in the evening time there shall come light again there will be a resurrection in the evening time there will be a resurrection there shall be light in the evening time you ever think about reading Zachariah in that day in the evening it shall be light in the evening it will be a resurrection amen see when it says shall be light y'all know that scriptures fulfilled right so you could read it in the evening time scriptures will be fulfilled because God will bring a resurrection in the bride to Quicken them to the word that's supposed to be lived out in this day something has to make this word alive it is the quickening power of Jesus Christ because lives amen My Redeemer Lives he's not dead that's him that's here manifesting the message in our generation William Brandon proved that Jesus was not dead can I propose to you tonight that our lord Jesus is not in a grave can I propose to you that deity is not even in heaven tonight but deity is in the Bride of Jesus Christ in your shoes tonight to fulfill the promised word of the hour you're living in it'll take God to do it amen what was it we was in a darkened world of unbelief we joined Methodist Baptist Pentecostal Presbyterians and there was still something wrong we just couldn't figure it out all of the sudden while we were groping in the darkness great Resurrection came to us in the manifestation of the promised word of God it brought light to us it brought light now the prophet of God tells us when that light comes of course what's it do amen light makes the Darkness turn loose light you you plunge this room just shut all the lights off plunge it right into darkness turn the light on and the Darkness moves so light is more powerful than Darkness light has a supreme authority over Darkness this message has a supreme authority over every voice you've ever heard it has the power to cancel whatever the devil has spoke to you whatever the the devil has said to your life Satan tries to claim you with the thought patterns of the denominational world but God said I'll bring another thing I'll bring light in the evening time and when that light be to shine it killed every seed of denomination and it drove out the Darkness and Light began to shine and when light begin to come into that place I tell you what it did when you come into that land you come into the on the first day when you're in that land the sheath will be waved it'll be back to that first day again you young brother bradam says it in paragraph 109 powerful amen I I'll read 108 I quoted it to you there's been churches churches Brides brides and Brides he said but there's got to be one Hallelujah to come a real bride so there's impersonation bride but it's real bride somebody said well I a lot of people claim to be the bride I don't care what they claim to be there's a real one somewhere there's a real one cuz God said it would be there he said now watch this there's got a become a real bride now watch you must identify the real bride there must come one that's not only got the mechanics we got to be real careful with this as message preachers as message people I personally lean to studying you're listening to me preaching you hear it don't you I I I I I just saturate myself in it I I literally lay in the quotes in the scripture and how do they time which way do they go it it's where my joy is it's where I it's where I really find strength and and I enjoy it so there's a mechanics of the word of God and how it operates and how it works but brother Ram said see but we can't only have mechanics he said but we got to have the Dynamics of it he said see it makes the church live it makes it move in the power of the resurrection and until we come to that place until we find the place what good does it do to polish the hubs what good does it do to give her a face Lo lift or a Simon's job when there's no Dynamics in it no matter how much the mechanics prove to be right there has got to be a dynamics that will make that work think about you can prove this message as as right every every service you can prove it's right every day in your life but till the Holy Ghost comes on it and makes it work in your life it does you no good come on church I'm going I'm going to tell you what the word says the spirit brings life but the letter kills amen the a lot of dead message people these days because they have went to letter letter letter letter letter and without the power of the Holy Ghost to come upon that life there's nothing to make it live so preacher what are you saying I'm saying if we're teaching the right thing it'll bring a power of God in the church so brother M said it very clearly he said the preaching of the mechanics is the gasoline and you try to get somewhere without gasoline come on Church crudel made to gasoline gives you way to go it's on the rise there's a great value in it cuz a lot of people ain't got it these days come on we need true word we need word preachers we must have word preachers but if it's gasoline let the spark come on it and see what happens if it's true gasoline Let the Fire come on it and see if it burns a little while but if we're just if we mixed up a bunch of ideas and we're putting water out in the church let the Holy Ghost fall and it'll just sputter out it'll just SP a little but if it's real gasoline that's being put on the church when the fire of God begins to fall there's a spar that falls in the church and the Dynamics of God begins to move and you'll see Sons and Daughters of God moving in the power of the Holy Ghost oh hallelujah what good is it to talk about a God that used to be come on Friends brother man said we talk about God how he used to do and what he used to do and how he used to be you know what brother B said that was he said you're painting up a fire he said but no cold man ever got warm by a painted fire and it's amazing to me while men paint fires of yesterday they put out the fire of today they're talk about what God used to be and at the same time they'd laugh at the at the Holy Ghost they'd laugh at the emotional part of the spirit moving in the church they'd laugh at the prayer lines and the power of God that drops in the church but if it's a true and spirit filled God CAU man that's something that'll ring True by the word of God and bring life upon the generation that we have come to I don't think we ought to paint a fire I think we ought to plant the same seed they planted preach the same gospel they preach and if the gospel is preached with power it'll produce power it'll bring power now I'm sorry some people say brother I've been in some of your meetings and people are just too loud and they're just shouting and holling and clapping and saying amen you excuse me this message has power I'm sorry if this message has enough power to get an amen out of somebody I thank God that this message will not allow us to lace dormant and cry the prophet of God said the holy ghost in a man will amen the word of God something on the inside we're going to scream out to the outside I'll tell you why more people don't do it now because they've been intimidated by the mock spirit in the end time that have black named the moving of the spirit of God but I believe somebody has got to be a real Pride somewhere that the Holy Ghost and still move on the church and the power of God can still move in the power and demonstration of God in the Church of the Living God you said preacher what are you talking about I'm talking about the Easter message we know the Thanksgiving message brother B said the Thanksgiving message you never done it in the first place and they ain't never been one preach like that brother amen you did did it in the first place but how many knows what he said the Easter message is he said the Easter message is the Dynamics and the mechanics are together and we're not waiting on it it's here we're not waiting on the Dynamics it's here the mechanics is here and so is the Dynamics that'll make that Mechanics Work in our life and it will only work as it comes together now when brother BR preaches about it you know what he does he takes Adam and he takes out of Adam Eve he said where' eve come from the rib God formed her body from the rib the same as he formed the bride from the word because the second adom came from the word he said so he forms the second Eve from the word but where did Eve get her spirit she didn't get another Spirit she got Adam's Spirit God put Adam's spirit in Eve and she lived and because he lived she lived and the Church of the Living God has been built from the material of the word and it's a perfect church it's a masterpiece Bri she's built in the very image of the god of Mercy that opened the word and designed her from the h part of his mind we did not design ourselves we did not design the church there's been a prophet Among Us that we are now the spoken word literal seed bride of Jesus Christ the designer has designed her the architect has anointed her and when that body comes to Perfection there's got to come a dynamics that makes her live this ain't a dead bride this ain't a dead word she's a living breathing manifesting Church of the Living God preacher what are you talking about can we just clarify what the Dynamics are I know y'all know what the Dynamics is somebody holler it out what is the Dynamics it's a refilling of the Holy Ghost how many knows brother R said that you identify with me do you know it if you don't put it up the Dynamics of the church will be a refilling of the Holy Ghost can we say it again the Dynamics to the church will be a refilling of the Holy Ghost the mechanics is the teaching of the word the Dynamics is a refilling of the Holy Ghost how many knows brother brandham said you can only prove the resurrection by a Pentecostal blessing you can't prove it any other way he said you'll never theologically prove it you'll never prove it he said by your education he said only the Pentecostal blessing can prove the resurrection of Jesus Christ come on church amen the Dynamics of the church of the Living God is a refilling of the Holy Ghost somebody said brother Wayne will you lost your mind no I ain't lost my mind somebody's going to have the fire of God somebody's going to have the light of God listen this is Matthew 25 I'm preaching Matthew 25 straight up to you that where 10 virgins went out and they all had they all had oil and they all had lamps come on that is Ze of Pentecost brother brand said they dipped it they dipped in the Holy Ghost it wasn't it but they dipped into it and they all walked together but there was a dispensational change come y'all know that and those ausa Street Pentecost didn't carry any oil in their lamps they had what they had but that's all they had but those other virgins carried a vessel with them and they walked with that word and they stayed with that word do y'all recognize that when the Midnight Cry came and when the and when the all the lamps had gone out now but those five wise virgins the Bible said they refilled the oil in their lamb they refilled the oil can you imagine that there's somebody going to refill the lamp somebody's going to keep the fire burning come on church amen this is the end of the year the fire's been burning but we can't let it go out we can't let the fire of God go out of the church he said preacher what are you talking about there was a supernatural fire started in the Bible the the priest offered God's burnt offerings on Supernatural fire and they couldn't have Strange Fire or they would die with Strange Fire right that that gives the mystery of why Elijah poured so many barrels of water on the on the fires that they tried to start with false gods he said I'll not have no Strange Fire on this Altar and the altar of this bride we don't have a Baptist fire we ain't got a Pentecostal fire we've got the fire of the supernatural God that in the beginning was God and in the end is God and he's come to refill the church to Quicken them to bring Dynamics oh Lord Jesus to bring this mortal flesh to his flesh have you ever thought about that I'm I'm going to quote brother brandom to you mortal flesh becomes his flesh right amen amen now we're still in Rising of the sun mortal flesh becomes his flesh Heen you said brother Wayne how are we supposed to do that he said accept the word and it will transform you it'll take you from what you was to what you're supposed to be it'll transform you amen it'll transform and his word brings forth sons and daughters of God that's what it's supposed to do I live you live also that's speaking to his wife to be quickened from the dead now you know Ephesians chapter 2 and verse one and you who he hath quickened who were dead in sins and trespasses we're in times past you walked according to the course of this world according to the prince of the power the spirit of that now worketh in the children of Disobedience among whom we had our conversation in times past in the lust of our flesh fulfilling the desires of our flesh and our mind and were by Nature the children of Wrath even as others I like that don't you by Nature not by seed we were by Nature the children of Wrath even as others amen but God who is rich in Mercy isn't that a powerful how many ever listen to that tape God rich in Mercy 1965 but God who is rich in Mercy I tell you what amen there's my story right there but God I was going this way what but God I I got Paul's testimony but God who is rich in Mercy this man's riding this was on his way to kill Christians when God stepped into his path and he said who are you Lord who are you he said I am Jesus whom thou persecutest and look at what he done he blinded the Man's eyes so he could see oh somebody shout hallelujah he blinded his eyes so he could see am he saw the great Pillar of Fire and it captured his vision and that's all he could think about and all that he could talk about because he had seen it with his own eyes he identified it was Jesus who was speaking to him look at what he did amen when he seen that he was on his way to do something horrible and let me say something to you but God who is rich in Mercy sometimes it ain't what God Amen C you out of sometimes it's not well I was a drunkard and he got me out of this I was a Doper and he got me out of this and he did amen but what about what God kept you from have you ever stopped for a moment somebody said well brother Wayne I don't have your testimony and I I thank God you don't because the god you're serving didn't get you out he kept you out my wife heard me give my testimony one time brother wait she said she said honey I don't have that testimony I wished I had your testimony I said that's funny I wished I had yours she never drank she never smoked she never kissed boy she never dated a boy I was the first boy she ever dated or anything in her whole life she didn't have a clue what the world was about and she said to me one time she said well I don't really have the testimony like I was delivered from this and this and this I said have you ever stopped and thought you got brother brandom's testimony you ever thought about that maybe somebody sitting in here tonight you raised on church pew and you come up and say boy I heard about this guy was in the world and they come out and I don't have their testimony no you got brother brandom's testimony you never drank you never smoked you never doped you never committed adultery you never had for come on church because God had a work for you so some of us are testifying of the grace of God what he can bring you out of and some of you are testifying what he could keep you out of either way God be glorified tonight that that Pillar of Fire has come into the church with anointing and with power do you see what it was amen Paul was the one writing that scripture there he had raised us up together he when he were dead in sins he had quickened us together and by Grace you are Sav it's powerful Paul's talking about a resurrection right there Paul's talking about a resurrection brother bam said see what caused this change he said there was a time being dead but to Quicken means to make alive there was a change from Death to life I'm preaching to you now there's supposed to be a resurrection in the end time something brings the bride from Death to life I live ye live is that right brother bam says see there was something he said there's no other thing that could happen to a person so great as a change from Death to life if a man was dying physically he could get healed physically but it'd be a great thing but nothing so great as when a spiritually dead and God quickens that man to life nothing paragraph 38 same scripture he says yet once same message yet once in times past you were dead and many of you here tonight one time can look back and know you were dead but now you ain't dead tonight Hey listen I want the devil to know I'm alive I want everybody to know I'm alive you know amen years ago devil kept telling me I first got saved you know if you come out of the world they devil haunt you now he'll haunt he'll haunt right behind you and one time I heard brother brandom actually in discernment there was a guy coming up in the prayer line brother BR said I see a black shadow following you he said that's a haunt of your former days he said but listen you're covered by the blood glory to God Amen the truth will set you free amen it Can it can haunt you but it can't take you Old Devil told me one time he said I tell you what you've done good for a few years but I'm won't get you yeah and I and I lived under that Hub just a little while and one day I stand in there and I turned around look back that devil and I said you know what if you could get me you would have got me you can't get me if you could get me you would have got me B you can't got me so you can't get me you said preacher what are you talking about I come pull pit sometimes I people I'm going to tell y'all so y'all know it's a secret it's a little deal I made with the devil sometimes I come to the pulpit and I just wave a flag like if some people thinks I'm surrendering I'm not not surrendered at all what this is it's a little sign between me and the devil and when I get up in the pull pit I'm waving a flag like this I'm telling the devil I'm still here I'm still living I'm still preaching I'm still preaching the power of God I'm still preaching the message of the hour you can throw all the disbeliever the sign you want to and I'm going to wave my flag I'm standing on the mountain still believing the word of God because it's the truth it's the power of God in this generation that lets a man stand we're not standing by oursel because he lives you live also amen sometime I tell you what y'all to do brother Bob sometimes y'all just pick your hair pick your way just wave your way little flag like this you said what are you talking about let that devil know I ain't giving up I ain't turning around ain't doing it I ain't turning around I ain't going back I'm on your hands now say I wasn't always in church yeah I I was a little bit rougher when I was in school and I was about seventh grade I think I was 4' 10 and you ain't going to believe this but I probably weighed 130 lbs sopping wet I was a scrawny fell but I grew up with three older brothers or two older brothers one younger brother but you know what I found out one day big old boy big old boy come over and he told me she going to whip me I looked at him a minute and I said well I tell you what you do I think you probably can but you got it to do what you waiting on sometime or another you got to tell the devil well you might do it but what you waiting on cuz if you're waiting on me to back up I ain't backing up if you're waiting on me to quit I ain't quitting if you're going to defeat me you're going to have to do it looking right at me cuz there's no retreat in me there's no backup in me there's no quit in me listen the Church of the Living God that's been anointed for the age we know who we are we know why we're standing here we know what we're about we know why we're here Amen brother B said you got eternal life tonight if we have eternal life then you always were am because there is only one form of eternal life and the reason we were is because we are a part of God and God is the only thing that's Eternal amen somebody say said to me one time said brother Wayne hey man how do you believe in this predestination stuff I said cuz I was a part of God just same as your son's a part of you I a part of him I didn't exist outside of God but as his life existed so when he manifests his life it becomes a son through manifestation it's aive amen now now I I I I just I'll just say this amen I I'm going to preach a message now somebody's got a little idea or they think this way or think that way that don't that's not anything to do with me just going to stay with the message is that all right with y'all and the prophet of God said but one day you being a part of God you had to be a part of the word and when you heard the word you knew where you come from and you know it was the truth you were always seed the seed was always in you the word seen the word and that was before the foundation of the world saw the word and you come to it and you said preacher amen now I don't I don't understand that well let me sit let me put it in hillbilly terms now the prophet taught us a lot of stuff if you come off the Farm things get simple if you heal Billy you catch the message quick he said it was a little duck born down in the chicken yard one time and he said that little duck was trying to fit in you talking about an ugly duck amen he didn't look like none of the other people he was with he was web footed and had this bill he sing funny talk funny act funny and he was different but thank God he was different right you were different you always was different I remember in high school I was different when I was in college I was different when I was with my friends I was different they amen I was always different I didn't understand why I was different but I was different right and that duck was different and brother man said things went pretty good till one day he walked around the barn and he saw a pond out there he said the first time he smelled that water he went straight to it I'll tell you what amen because he was a duck to begin with amen it didn't change what he was it only revealed what he was and the prophet of God said see we always was a son you were a son to begin with the same thing it is to a Believer there's something in him when he meets God face to face he comes to himself the seed is in him and it's quickened watch it's resurrected now that's why I'm preaching this it's Resurrection it's a quickening of that seed brother man said something got a hold of us something quickened us and that seed come to life think in man's filter brother man said notice the word cannot deny itself it is sad Saied or it's a desire of what what made you desire it in the first place now that's the question is it what made you want this to begin with that's a powerful question sister April I tell you what that if that that is the answer to our life what made you want it to begin with what made you desire it out of all the others of all the people of all the situation you desire I'll tell you what it is brother bam said because down in your soul there was a predestinated seed with eternal life that was always laying there it always was in there and all the father hath given to me will come there isn't any of them going to be lost brother praise be to God you said preacher what are you talking about brother bam says it in thinking man's filter he said when a thinking man begins to think who he's going to stand before and the word of God when he begins to think then he begins to draw through that there's see there's nothing can get to it but the Holy Ghost oh brother amen How could a prophet of God say you would never commit adultery that you were ordained to begin to make a stand it BW it blew my mind one day I was listening to brother brandom he said there's a second Eve that won't fall I mean it was a it was a it was a mind-blowing revelation brother man said here it is here's the secret the second Eve cannot fall I thought dear Lord how can she not fall and one day a couple years later I'm listening to another sermon and brother B him on the tape he said she can't fall he said that first Eve she fell from the word now that's that's the secret she fell from the word he said but now that second Eve can't fall because she is the word oh brother amen she can't fall cuz she is the word amen and Heavens in Earth can pass away but my word will never fail look at that if that word Amen brother B said what is it it's the germ the seed word from the beginning that God Amen you was in God at the beginning standing there drawing Seed Life the seed is in Your Heart by for ordination the seed is already in there by the for knowledge of God predestinated when it draws it can't draw nothing but the word look at that God put something in you that can't receive nothing but the Holy Ghost isn't that powerful the Bible said in the last days it would be so deceptive it would deceive the elect brother R said there's election elect if it were possible ain't that powerful that if it was possible you could be deceived if it were possible you wouldn't be able to but God has designed you in such a way that you could not receive anything but this word my my my there's only one thing that'll pass through there that's the Holy Ghost amen is it it's God Awakening the church to bring the promises of God effective upon the church now I want you to think about this brother BR said there'll be a second crucifixion of Jesus Christ right he said the church would have a second crucifixion of Jesus Christ he said but this time it won't be crucified on a Roman Tree he said it'll be crucified from the pulpits right he said what do they do he said they don't they don't crucify the flesh they crucify the effect the word has upon the church we don't want to crucify the effect of the word but the word was sent that it might manifest Christ in the church now look at what he said it'll bring an Effectiveness in the church now watch this brother B said there's three Realms there's three Realms we live in we live in a human realm we live in a divine revelation realm but the Third Realm is a vision realm and look at the church we have we have moved to the realm of vision God has had a vision of the Church of what she should be we are living in the vision of God concerning the bride in the end time look at Ezekiel 37 it said that he would cause the Israel to come out of the graves those Graves were not natural Graves they were Graves of Russia and Germany and Italy and they were Graves all over the world because they were Jews to begin with they were born in the wrong place they were placed in the wrong countries but they were Jews to begin with and God would bring them back to their Homeland oh Church of the Living God and God has a message you are in the graves of Baptist and in the graves of Lutheran and in the graves of denomination but God said I'll bring them out of the Grave there shall be a resurrection in the end time what is it it's a resurrection God has opened the graves and called the church out of the Grave I tell you it's a powerful thing when you begin to study the resurrection I know I know when you study I know when you study here and you see U when you see Lazarus in the Bible it's a natural resurrection of course it is but it would be would it be all right if we typed it in the Supernatural in the spiritual Resurrection would that be okay with y'all do y'all recognize that he was raised on the fourth day you recognize that Jesus went the other way until he was already gone and returned when it was too late for him to resurrect and it happened to be an even in time he returns and comes according to vision and you you watch you the beauty of the scriptures amen that one of the girls stayed in the house and the other goes out to meet him you know there's there's a lot of going on there amen but but I want to get this point that Jesus was coming for the reason to fulfill the vision of Resurrection he was going to resurrect Lazarus and Lazarus was in the grave now y'all y'all study restoration of the Bride tree you study Joel too you know that there was four bugs of death and there's four Restorations right the last one is the word and the word itself was coming for the resurrection of Lazarus and the word itself comes for the resurrection of the Bride somebody else didn't come to resurrect you but the word came to do the resurrection now and when he found was wasn't it Martha that comes out I got it written down here but it it but it was it was here in the scripture amen that when I believe it was Martha coming comes out to him and she actually says to him Lord if you would have been here my brother wouldn't have died I think it was good of her she said Lord at least if you would have been here when my brother wouldn't died you know brother Ram said right there she had a right to be mad at him she had a right to bought him out for going the other way when she needed he said she had a right to do it he said but if she had took her right she wouldn't have seen the supernatural he said and you got a right to live the way you want you got a right to think the way you want but if you keep your right you will never see the supernatural that resurrects the church right but she surrendered that right and called him Lord and said if you had have been here my brother wouldn't have died and Jesus and Jesus therefore amen I think is powerful amen that's when he began to tell her listen now amen amen Jesus said to her won't you just take me to the place with the stone lay upon it and Jesus said take away the stone Martha and the sister of him that was dead saith unto him Lord by this time he stinks he's been dead four days now what she's telling him is I appreciate you trying but this ain't going to happen now this thing's too far gone for there to be a resurrection now you should have come a couple of days ago while this thing was still revivable but you've let it go too far too long and it ain't going to happen now and Martha said to him she said unto him Lord but this time he stinketh and he said been dead 4 days and Jesus said unto her I say unto thee that if thou wouldest believe thou should see the glory of God then they took away the Stone from the place where the dead was laid and Jesus lifted up his eyes and said father I than thee that thou has htest me and I know thou has Hest me always but because of these people which stand by is sayth that they may believe that thou has sent me and when he thus had spoken he cried with a loud voice Lazarus come forth now y'all know y'all know what that means that means a dead man four days in the grave he's done fellowshipping with Abraham he's done sitting at the table he's done talking with David and Abraham he's sitting there fellowshipping and he hears a voice Lazarus can you imagine when he stopped and turned around looked at all of them and said hey y'all hear something yeah y'all y'all y'all hear something no we don't hear a thing brother brandom said look he said if he hadn't said the man's name the entire grave would have empted but he called him by name I hope you're hearing me tonight amen I'm talking about a resurrection in the graveyard I'm talking about Le DEA everything is dead but he called your name and there's a Revival in the middle of Le DEA because the Lamb's Book of Life was open and he called you by name I tell you what man he heard that voice and he was trained to that voice he was trained to that voice and he answered that voice you know what you know what the prophet of God said about it he said Martha told him said Lord said it's too late and brother Bram says watch what she says but even now but even now brother B said there was a turning point but even now amen and he told this woman go go roll away the stone and Jesus said unto him Lazarus come forth and a man that's been Dead 4 days comes out of the Tomb now I'm talking about Resurrection a man been dead 4 days comes out of the Tomb because life was speaking that dead could not stay in the grave when it called his name now you may remember the service brother Ed you may remember the service when something called your name brother Dale do you remember when it was that you were sitting and something called you by name amen some of you said maybe you was in some other place but something identified you and you can't get away from it you can't shake loose of it you can't outrun it amen something has identified you in this resurrection and you come forth from out of the grave now I want you to watch something here John 14 go back to the 19th verse and let's read that verse again and let's read 19 and 20 together and uh can I share something a little Revelation here with you amen John John 14 verse 19 and 20 I want you to watch something happens here amen now I've got a bunch of quotes on it I'm not going to read them to cuz I don't have time but John 14: 19 what he says yet a little while and the world seeth me no more but you see me now there's your two resurrections because I live ye live also what happens in the very next verse what's the next verse and at that day oh that's Sunday at that it's Sunday yo at that day ye shall know that I am in the father and ye in me and I in you brother Ram breaks that down to this this day right but he continues to say this is when Elohim becomes tangible in the bride y'all remember brother BR said it's the it's God imor in Bride form right imorph speaks of the invisible becoming visible he becomes a visible tangible God in The Bride of Jesus Christ you become the hands and the feet and the body it is the bride body of Jesus Christ now if it's been resurrected now he's telling you you're going to be transformed that your mortal flesh will become his flesh so it isn't good enough for you just to be alive you've got to take on the word it didn't it didn't power of transformation y'all heard it y'all heard the entire tape brother BR said now that we're saved now that we're filled with the Holy Ghost what do we do he said we're to be formed in the image of Christ so we're to take on the word that it would it would bring us into the image that God had designed us to be in in the back part of his mind and there's only one message that can get you there I I I he Allen's a good probably a good preacher Billy Grahams got some good thoughts uh I heard brother Andrew said it one time somebody said something about TD Jake said got some good points he said I got some good I got some pencils in my draws got good points too when talking about good points we're talking about the bride of Christ and if you want to be a good church member listen to any preacher you want to you want to be the bride of Christ you be able to get out of this message it's the only thing that can develop you into the image that God saw you in to begin with so he resurrects a bride and then he shows himself in the bride by the development of that word in the church it is the transforming power it's the strength and the part so watch what happens when Lazarus resurrects watch in the scripture when Lazarus resurrects Jesus don't leave him there he don't just resurrect him he turns and changes his dressing he says to them loose him yeah y'all know y'all know where brother Bram took that loose him he said let's take that word in the Book of Revelation 21 and there's a new Heaven and a new Earth coming down a new Heaven because the old Heaven and the old Earth have passed away but said no it's not annihilated he said it's a change it's a change of the government it's a changing of the of the of the of the politics it's a changing of the control brother BR breaks it down in three worlds old world present World New World right he he changes the thing he adorns it so what are we talking about that that word pass away means to loosen from the former condition it means to release from the bondage of what it has been amen that was an old Lazarus that was a present Lazarus and there was a future Lazarus oh Church of the Living God am God wasn't going to leave him in the present State he was alive but he was bound up look at the Scripture it said loose the man and let him go loose him and let him go I've got a vision for him I've got a purpose for his life it's the same words Jesus said to his disciples concerning the CT remember that amen Zachariah said he would enter the city R in that colt that CT was ordained to be the thing that carried the word of God n my goodness they ain't enough time to preach I just ain't got enough time to preach y'all too good a congregation amen that that that that cult sitting there and I the reason I say that cuz I want to preach on the knock NE need mu right now the crosseyed larded knock need B back y'all remember him and he said I'm going to die the moment the farmer sees me y'all remember that one I'm going to die the moment the farmer sees me brother B said but he had a scriptural taught mother and she said honey he don't sacrifice mules he sacrifices Lambs so in the morning he ain't coming to get you he's going to come and get a lamb and if he finds a lamb you can live and if he finds the lamb brother bam that's when he said any old any any old man could be redeemed y'all know what I'm talking about amen anyone can be redeemed if you find the lamb and the prophet of God said when that when that when that mule got its lamb he said kicked his feet up enjoyed it I I mean maybe it's a stretch but I kind of figured that was the cult that was tied down there and some reason they didn't ride him and some reason nobody wanted it I'm preaching to you or some reason the world didn't want you or some reason you were a reject everywhere you went but there was a lamb for you so God didn't kill you he held you to a time that he would loose you God would send the servant somewhere to untie the knot that held you that you could pack this word I'll tell you when he come off of the mountain is in the Book of Matthew and they come off of that mountain and they begin to rejoice and scream and holler and praise God Amen I tell you what's powerful I bet that I bet that cult might have felt pretty good a time or two and all them people shouting and screaming but they wern't looking at him they were looking at that lamb oh thank God the word has chose a vessel to ride into this age take away the grave clothes that hold the man he's been in them clothes four days he stinks he's he is he is transferred his stinking rotting corrupted flesh has transferred to the clothing he's wearing and he's he's not presentable and God won't leave him that way and nor will he leave his bride dressed in the rags of unrighteousness of denominational teachings he will not leave us come on Church the rejection of a prophet he said the the crowning of my ministry will be the dressing of this bride she'll be orded in the righteousness of the word of God y'all know where where I'm at don't you take the grave clothes off of I I love how y'all y'all ever y'all ever you ever preach on that much it's a powerful point of scripture it said he was bound hand and foot he was bound by his feet was bound his hands were bound and you know you could start at the bottom just go up if you wanted to he was bound hand and foot y'all ever think about this I years and years and years ago I preached this entire sermon titled mummified Christians y'all can just imagine how that went see you're alive but you bound see Lazarus was alive he was breathing but his feet was bound y'all know what that you know what that you know what I'm talking about he couldn't walk he couldn't obey the word he couldn't walk the word now I I like to put it over a little bit like this he couldn't dance either isn't it something God give us all these wonderful musicians come on church and adopted church has good musicians it's part of the body and these musicians that was ordained of God to play so a church that's going to be positionally place going to have musicians God's going to bless you God's going to put them there and you you say well we don't have any well God God will send them you got to get them there but if you got them God gave them to you amen now you said preacher why you say that cuz some people don't like to hear our musicians play they don't like them play with their heart you know they want to play want them to play but not play y'all know what I'm talking about play but don't play you know play but don't put your heart in it but I think you ought put your heart in it I don't think you're playing for American band stand you playing for God come on church I know there's Church of Christ Spirits right hearing the message I know it is they don't want to see our musicians enjoy what they do and play their music but God does God loves music I'm in the message you know I am amen and and God loves music but if you got good music what happened that we can't dance now I'm in the Bible y'all know I'm in the Bible Psalms 150 said praise God in the dance now it's either the word or it ain't the word come on Church but something has took the dance out of the church y'all tell me who took it out somebody tell me please tell me who took the dance out of the church who bound the feet of the Bride so they can't dance no more I I I you know I'm I'm just being honest I know I know we got a mixed congregation in here and you know what I mean it it's it's a powerful thing to me that people have a liberty to dance I feel a little check right there I feel a little something coming in the room but let me tell you something about that I know where I'm at scripture you don't have authority to take the dance out of the church God put it in and by what Authority do you take it out right come on church I don't believe you y'all y'all have hoot nannies around here huh used to have hoot nannies I grew up and they were hoot nannies all around where I was at they go out and drink yeah they they dust the floor with some flow and they'll they'll play their banjos and this and that and they'll get out there and Hoot nanny I don't think our young people are to have to go to a hoot nny to enjoy dancing I don't believe it I don't believe the first time your young person dances they ought to have to go to a hoot Nanny to do it I think we ought to get an atmosphere in the church that it ain't out of order to [Applause] dance somebody worried about a kid crying here while back and I told him I said if you was an Africa you wouldn't even hear that kid but our churches get so quiet that every little thing bothers us somebody say amen and well I tell you what if you get the grave clothes off bring the worship back in the church amen Let the Church of the Living God worship the god of Creation with anointing and with power amen I tell you what it ought not be a quiet place come on somebody said well I can't take all this noise brother B said this is the quietest place you will ever be y'all know the quotes y'all know what I'm talking about brother B said it clear he said if you go to hell it'll be screaming nashing the teeth he said if you go to heaven the angels of God are going to be worshiping y'all read the book of Isaiah and Isaiah went to the temple and the Bible said that the voice of the Angel shook the temple post brother BR said that was one Angel did that one Angel the voice of one Angel shook the temple post he said what's it going to be when you get in heaven and there's a million Angels worshiping God at the same time brother let me tell you what if this down here gives you a little Goosebump he said you'll freeze to death when you get to heaven amen and I tell you what else you're going to have you're going to have me and brother Wade up there and you're going to have to listen to us a hooping and a hoing and a screaming and a shouting he said preacher what are you talking about you get this boy in heaven and you'll see what I'm talking about get me out of this whole world and all of its troubles and struggles and put me on the streets of [Music] Glory I know y'all think I'm crazy but I I tell you what I am I'm free I might be crazy but I am a free man I am not bound up with what somebody thinks about me I loved it when God finally delivered me amen of what everybody in the church thought about me I got to a place I really don't care somebody said well somebody's going to think bad of you really are they really what do they think about David in the Bible then when he danced as a king before his God God Amen I tell you if a king can humble himself and dance in the presence of God and what about a preacher that's been saved by grace and the power of the Holy Ghost come down in the church I tell you what I think I think we ought to take the grave clothes off of the people and let them get the dance back in the church let them get joy back in their heart let them get joy back in their feet preacher what are you preaching about I tell you what I'm talking about I'm talking about we're alive take the grave clothes off so we can live it was on their hands can can we just preach about it is it okay y'all ain't no hurry are you it feel pretty good in here right now I thought about taking a run while ago it feel pretty good you going you going to run with me ain't you I was out I was out at brother uh Roy Shrewsberry one time in Beckley West Virginia you know brother Roy and I was up there preaching my we was having a wonderful time and brother Bobby was a song leader during that time and at the end of the service they was playing just a song the power of God Dropped In and my goodness we got to dancing on the platform I I I've did it and we were just dancing on the platform we were enjoying ourselves and brother Bob's behind me and the next thing I know he's dancing with me and he starts screaming and took off running out the door running around the parking lot run back in I said what happened brother Bobby he said I've had a knee that's been banged up for years he said I've been looking at surgery he said I've been terrible brother Wayne I ain't been able to work or nothing else he said when I got up to dance with you he said God healed that knee brother Wayne there ain't a thing wrong with me right now amen because see the super natural touched him he said God healed my knee now I'm going to have to get some lungs cuz I can't do this running he said I'm too old running's funner when you're younger you know loose them take the grave clothes off I me get them off the hands get them off the hands we lift our hands again we can lift our hands and worship God and praise God and tell that Old Devil look here I'm going to shout I'm going to praise God Heen look at me Church you don't have to have your hands bound you can worship God you can clap you can praise God I'm alive I'm free I'm I'm i' I've had the grave clothes taken off of me I'm not ashamed of this God I serve no you you can just go right up can't you cuz he had a the Bible said he had a cloth upon his face which spoke of what was coming his mouth was covered his eyes was covered he couldn't see the word he couldn't speak the word he couldn't prophesy he couldn't he couldn't rejoice in the spirit he was bound by grave clothes but God didn't leave him there he resurrected him and took the grave clothes and this message has done more than resurrect us it's done more than Quicken us it has loosed the Bands that would hold the church that they might have Liberty and have it with the spirit of God said preacher what are you talking about I tell you what I'm talking about I'm talking about a spiritual Resurrection but not left like you were I see it in the scripture when the prodical son come home y'all remember he left but when he got ready to come home how many knows what the Bible said he said I will arise and go back to my father's house you know what he was doing come on church he was about to eat the husk of Pentecost he was getting ready to eat husk because he was living in a famine but the only reason he was in a famine is cuz it wasn't his position and he was trying to be somebody else and listen somebody else probably can be that but not you you'll never make it out there brother you ain't you ain't anointed to be there and when that man got ready to go home he said I'll go home and be a servant even the servants in My Father's House eat better than this out here what I'm a fooling with and he got ready to go home and the Bible said he arose do you know when he got home the Bible ible says his dad said my son that was dead is alive he resurrected Church Heen it was a spiritual Resurrection he was dead but he was alive it's your story you were dead but you come alive God gave you life but look at what happened when that prodical son got to coming home listen there's a lot of men come over that Hill there's a lot of men walk down that road but when that father seen that one come Lord when he seen that one coming he didn't let him get to the house no sir he didn't let him get to the house you know what he done he run out and met him they sang that song the only time God Ran it was powerful isn't it God got up and that father ran to meet him have you ever wondered why he met him out in the field like that before he ever got home have you ever thought about it he met him out there and said my son that was dead is alive but you know what he did when he met him out there he embraced him how he was right do you know brother brandom said the moment you said in your heart I'm sorry God accepted it look at this heyen brother Bram talks about brother bam talks about this and he talks about that mother of the prodical son do you know what he said the reason they knew he was coming home he said because she had been praying he said and the angel of the Lord was about a half hour in front of the boy and said your boy's coming home so they was expecting him that morning because something had supernaturally taken place and when he started coming over there that was their boy that was their son right and he was coming home and that Dad went out to meet him you know what he said I I I don't have time to preach on the best Ro but I'll tell you this powerful thing right here he said bring me the best robe do y'all know what the best robe is in a house like that that was not a poor man he said bring me the best robe Hallelujah bring me the best robe we got come on now the boy was standing there and his father the father took off the dirty garments and put his own personal robe around his own son look at what he did he was identifying that boy this is my son this is not a servant and no matter what you think about yourself and no matter what the devil has said about you you cannot return to God as a servant because you never were a servant you never were an angel you always was a son and you can only come home as a son and when he got ready he put that best robe upon that boy and I tell you what man you could preach an hour on this thought right here and he took the shoes and put up his feet he said Preacher what's that matter because back in those days slaves didn't have no shoes slaves wasn't allowed to wear shoes and it allowed them to identify a slave a long ways off but that man was trying to come home as a slave and he couldn't receive him as a slave the household couldn't receive him as a slave he was not a slave he was a son so his father put shoes on his feet put a robe upon his hand Put a Ring upon his finger you said preacher what are you getting now he would not allow that boy to go home in the condition he came in he wouldn't let the rest of the house see him in that condition but he changed it before he got him home oh Church of the Living God there's a bride that's going home one of these mornings but we're not going home without shoes we're not going home without a robe we're not going home without a ring but the heavens will see you the way God saw you to begin with praise the Lord preacher what are you talking about I'm talking about you're the property of God and he has a right to redeem you absolutely he has a right yeah to unclo you from what you've been clothed and put on you now I know some of you I know some of you spent a long time in the world I'm closing I know some of you spent I know some of you spent your time and some of the situations you're in let me say something to you I don't care how long I don't care how long the devil's had a hold of you he has no right to hold you God owns you God owns you and has a right to call for you to come out of that grave and to change the robe that you're wearing you know something something come to my attention here just a few days ago I was down at my dad's and uh we we grew up we grew up there in Arkansas and most of our surveying down there pretty sorry I just had to be honest back in the back in the 40s and the 50s you know they used a rock and a tree and you know uh it was a little bit matter of fact the the road that goes in front now where my dad it it just it just twists like this they ain't a straight road there you know all the property lines are straight but the roads cured around because it curs through one guy's property and back through another guy it don't follow any of the property lines you know so everything's just goofed up and him and him and his neighbor up there they was kind of in old man's land they got in a fight when I was a little kid they got in a fight over the property in the front yard my dad he hauled a bunch of dirt and took a dozer and fixed it all and and that guy come off the hill one day after it got good and fixed you know he come off the hill and claimed it he said this this property is mine my dad said it ain't your property you live in the city this is in the county get get back where you come from and man man it got pretty it got pretty rough you know we wasn't Christian people and we it got rough out there it went to fist fights and and troubles and and people got hurt and one day I asked my dad I said Dad I said you I never seen you fight with nobody I never seen you fight like this with anybody I said what in the world is going on that land matters to you that much he saidon he said' if I met that man out on the street somewhere I'd have somewhere to get away from him' he said if we was out there and and and he come up to me in the in the gas station I could walk off and leave him I didn't got to fight with him he said but he come to my front door he said how far do you want me to run I can't run no further he's got me in a corner he said I got to fight he said if a man won't fight for what belongs to him he ain't no man in him I said I got you I understand that's that's good so after a little while that fight went away and my dad buys a property next to him another lot and that it's it's a nice little lot there but when they built the house on the lot they built a road right in front of the house the house was setting on that guy's property but because the road was built there it was an easement and as long as the house was there they couldn't do nothing about it so when the people that own the house passed away my dad made an offer to buy it and the night he bought it the guy burns the house down so he now has that piece of property by law he he contains that piece of property and it CAU cut my dad off from the road so uh here while back then back this spring my sister she bought her a trailer she want to sit on that property well she comes down my dad's driveway and sets the property up as soon as she sets the trailer here comes the son to the guy I mean it's a family tradition here comes the son to the guy and and he says he says you can't do that and you can't be here and they put a fence up man it was oh it was Katie Bar the Door try to cut them off from water and ready to fight and everything else well my nephew is a state policeman so when he showed up there to say What's Happening Here everything starts calming down a little bit more you know so so I I heard about them all the way in Ohio and so I I I I called my parents and talk to them and I come down well if you come to my dad's house when you come off the main street it's a it's a hill you come off the main street you'd think you just come straight to his house you know but you got to go around this corner and then you come down to his house so his so his driveway literally curves just like that well in the curve of the driveway is a big old shop building belongs that same guy so I got a plaid of the whole area cuz I I used to survey years ago so I said we're going to fix this final if if one property line matters all the property lines matters let's just figure out what's what so I'm looking at a plat and when you look down on that plat that guy has built his shop right in the middle of my dad's driveway and I'm like this guy that's so worried about that property line has a shop setting in your driveway in the property lines literally I said dad get you a lawyer make the man move the thing and put these property lines back and let's end this fight for sure he said son I went to a lawyer the other day and ask him about that very thing he said they can't do nothing about it I said what he said yep it's been there over 20 years he said in the state of Arkansas seven years is a squatter's right uncontested it belongs to the man now seven years uncontested it I thing we can do about it I said nothing he said nothing I said dear Lord squatters rides and I got to think about that I thought you know brother BR said the devil was a squatter that's when you take that's when you take trespassing too far it's one thing to walk across the man's ground it's another thing to say it's yours and Satan is trying to not cross your life he's trying to claim your life but brother Bram said but by scripture there is is no squatter right so there's no legal time no matter how long the devil has been plaguing you there's no time limit that says that he can stay so brother Ram says Satan first of all you're a squatter remember he says you're a squatter he said then the church has a right to enforce the legal claim upon on what God has given them now I'm not off in in a left field somewhere brother said restoration of brid tree when the Sun rises he said it forces the claim of life upon the seed and makes it return back no matter how long the Winter's been when the light begins to shine the flowers come out and brother R said and Satan is a squatter in your life and has no right to stay there do you know if you've been sick even for a long time Satan is a squatter and all you have to do is notify him that he has no right to stay here and you have a right to enforce that rule upon him tonight for salvation or for healing for your body amen maybe a spirit's been plaguing you for years and Satan's saying to you you're always going to be nervous you're always going to be anxious you're always going to be depressed you're always going to have this sickness you're always going to have this trouble I've been here for 10 years and you can't make me leave he's a liar and he's a squatter on the property of almighty God he's a squatter Church you said preacher what are you saying I'm saying the Bible said a woman had an issue of blood 12 years y'all ever wonder why it numbers the years 12 years but when she touched Jesus it was over our musicians could come there was a man laid by a pool of Bethesda 38 years so preacher what do you say I'm saying he had a condition that wasn't killing him can I can I make it spiritual yeah I besetting sin something crippled you up on brother 38 years but Jesus came Jesus came by am 38 years was over do you ever wonder why God let Congressman Upshaw go 66 years y 66 years and in one meeting y the man walked yes God's proven to this bride there's no time limit on your healing right right brother there's no time limit right you say I've been suffering with this problem a long time way I don't care how long it's been Satan's a squatter and he has no right it's Sunday it's Sunday it's Sunday again the resurrection has came he didn't just raise them he took the grave clothes off of them 38 years did you ever notice that Georgie Carter was n years Y and some odd months yeah nine years by the way the first time I realized why she was in that condition it broke my heart y'all know why Georgie Carter was laying there nine years her uncle was taking her to a piano lessons and raped her and it put to burcul losis in her body she wasn't laying there for her own account somebody did that to her but God said no matter what somebody done to you no matter why you're in the condition you're in even if been nine years and a prophet came by under vision and said thus saith the Lord rise and the woman got up and walked after nine years I told this testimony down at brother Tim's meetings in the fall but last year you know brother you know Brother David Cross and Heather cross from Josh Bennetts brother David's the cross Brothers Tim and every church has got his cross right brother David and sister Heather anybody anybody know Heather know she suffered with arthritis about 15 years she it was bad enough me and her talked about it a couple years before before that meeting last year on the Saturday night they brought her in Joe Joe Adams actually said I feel led tonight sister Heather that you would come in this prayer line they brought her in the prayer line and when they did spirit of God moved in there and after 15 years she was instantly healed in that meeting completely free after 15 years you know the devil's told some of y'all it's been too long that thing's been it's been there too long this the problem you know what I mean it's the problem's been we can't talk it out no more you know the issue is too big brother Wayne you just don't understand you don't understand the God I'm serving you don't understand what's causing the problem is a spirit and that demon has went from trespassing to squatting and he said it belongs to him but he's a liar and all you need to do tonight is to notify that devil you have no right in this place anymore you you can notify that Spirit tonight you can't stay here I'm serving you papers Satan amen I'm serving papers amen hallu any of y'all go through covid any of y'all you can play Amazing Grace if you want to just real softly I went through Co got this brain fog if anything I ever had in my life was a memory I can stand to just tell you every scripture and every quote and the reason I preached this and what year I preached it and I could tell you and not only my sermons I can tell you your sermons and any other sermon I heard is just like this that Co had come a little fog hit my mind next thing I knew couldn't hardly remember nothing and one day the devil was telling that's the way it's going to be from now on I standed next to a brother and he said said something about it and I said yeah that crazy brain fog he said brother Wayne I'm going to join with you right now we need your ministry we're going to join together right now we're going to defeat that devil in the name of Jesus Christ that brainfall is going to leave you and you know what from that day out things started changing there's a God in this room right now that can change the situation he can put things back like they're supposed to be amen he can he can sure do it tonight amen I know you've been sitting a long time won't you just stand with me isn't that isn't that isn't that amazing [Music] tonight did you could serve notice I wonder would anybody do it with me tonight Satan I serve notice on you maybe you got to you need a healing in your body tonight maybe there's something a sin been beset in you it's been there a long time but we're serving notice on that devil right now I'm gon to pray with you tonight and I'm going to ask you to serve notice on that enemy and let's agree together tonight that there'll be a change there'll be a change happening in your life father God I do not come here in the name of a denomination I do not have ordination papers from any group of men or any counsel but by a commission of March 16 we have been ordained of God to stand here in this place tonight and Satan I challenge you to a debate tonight upon the word of God by this scripture I can show you that with the blood of Jesus Christ has cleansed sin set the captive free and gave the right for healing in every body now Satan I charge ye by the Living God by the commission of March

Monday November the 21st I called his primary doctor he couldn't see him so he had to see a PA that was Tuesday November the 22nd I was able to give him a bath and get his clothes on to go to the doctor we set up we were sitting on the couch and I was reaching down to put on his shoes and he fell off the couch slid off the couch into the floor I couldn't get him up Lisa come and help me tried to help me get him up everybody else was gone so we couldn't get him up so Lisa come in and she said I'm going to call the paramedics to help us so she went outside to wait on the paramedics so brother Dale was still on the floor and I stood over him and I said Lord I said we've got to get him up out of this floor well the next thing I knew I was standing over him he was about 6 ft away laying on the floor and when I got to myself he was sitting on the bed 6ot away out of the floor and I was standing beside of him well I I did not know when I I did not walk over there he did not walk over there to the bed so the Lord had to come to our house that day amen and when you when you've went through a vision like this you'll never be the same person never so the next thing that I knew that he was sitting on the bed and I was standing beside of him I don't remember any of that he doesn't remember any any of that the God God had to move on me too because I was over there with him and I did not walk over there I did not walk over there over there so when Lisa come in she said with a paramedic she said well Nanny how did you get him up out out the floor I said I didn't I don't know he was on the floor when she left about 10 minutes before when she got back with a paramedic he was sitting on the bed and I was standing beside of him thank you Lord they they checked him and and said they would take him to ER but he'd probably catch more than what he already had so then um when he got to the doctor's office he had a high temperature that was why he was out of his head they give him an antibiotic and the next day he went back and they called him and said they wanted a covid test well we took him back for a covid test and it was positive so thank God he had a mild case that time this is the third time he's had it anyway thanks I want to thank him for visiting in our house that day and we asked him that night I said well did you know the paramedics come he did not know anything from that morning until late that night he did not know anything that went on he didn't know he went to the doctor he didn't know anything so I just praise his glorious name go whoever's

so let's take communion let's everybody stand to their feet you know I A friend of mine brother Claude wisinger his his former Pastor brother Jeff traml you've heard me telling I'll tell you for the visitors I asked him I said he said when do y'all take communion I said well we take communion first Sunday of every month he said really he said he said brother Jeff said well we you know we we take communion when we feel like everybody's ready I said we'd never take communion hello somebody when we felt everybody was ready but you know what at this church we get ready cuz we know we're going to take communion the first Sunday of every month amen so we're going to get ready for it and you know what it does it helps that month begin so much better that I believe let's give our brother one more good hand man he poured his heart out we're going to take communion here at midnight it's 12:00 Happy New Year if we're around here another year that's okay if we're not we going to have this same meeting on the other side amen we've went through a lot we've had a lot of troubles heartaches and trials you know what we've had a lot of Victory amen let's count the victories and forget the problems amen so let's continue now let's go to St John if you want to read with me and supper being ended the devil having now put in the heart of Judas his carrot Simon son to betray him Jesus knowing that the father had what like this the father had given all things into his hands amen and that he was come from God and he's going back to God when are we going to realize lives we came from God and we going back to God Amen scripture speaks of him speaks of us is I know what the prophet told us thank God for a prophet thank God for a prophet that could give us Clarity on what the scripture is saying all right Jesus knowing that the father had given all things into his hand that he was come from God and he went to God he rises from suffering laid aside His Garment and took a towel I'm reading the let me go to Corinthians I'm reading the Paul tells us in second Corinthians 1 Corinthians I thought we was going to do some foot washing but not tonight you know Paul it took Paul um brother D's always told us and I don't know if you thought of this or not but Paul was not in the upper room Paul was not there that's right Matthew was there John was there nobody wrote about it like Paul did right cuz Paul had Clarity Paul knew what happened he knew why it was going to happen he was already born again when he wrote that so God just took him right back into the upper room and said for I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread and when he had given thanks he broke it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this do you in remembrance of me after the same manner also he took the cup and when he had St saying this cup is the New Testament that was an Old Testament they were living under the Old Testament but he said this is a new testament in my blood not animal blood my blood we're fixing to make a new testament that's why the New Testament didn't start Matthew Mark Luke and John Jesus lived in the Old Testament that's right John was the one to bring us to the what to the new introduced the Messiah and then when he was crucified there was a new testament so the book of Acts is really starts the New Testament Lord as we know it amen after the same manner also he took the cup when he had s saying this cup is the New Testament in my blood this do you as often as you drink it in remembrance of me for as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup you do show the Lord's death till he comes wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord but let a man examine himself thank God he give us a place he said but let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup for he that eateth and drinketh unworthy eth drinketh damnation to himself not Discerning the Lord's body now who's the Lord's body he was standing there in flesh but who's the Lord's body now that's me and you if you eat and drink this unworthily you're you're you're hurting the body not the body sitting on the throne up there you're hurting the body here amen unconfessed sin brother Brown said make a congregation fa bitterly fail for this caused many are weak and sickly among you and many sleep let's get this right let's get this right and we won't have as much sickness we have seen people healed pop we've seen people healed taking communion I mean healed of um u high blood pressure and sugar diabetes just by taking communion praise the Lord amen and if you're ever at home I want to tell you one thing if you're ever at home and you and you miss communion and you want communion if God will given me strength and Grace I'll bring it to you and you can take it at your house cuz we did that for one brother and that's why he got healed amen come up speaking in tongues taking communion but if you need it if you can't get here on Sunday of the service you just call me and I'll try my best through all my three or four jobs I'll try my best to get over there I we'll get somebody to give you communion amen don't want you to miss it cuz it cleans us it cleans us up it gets us to remember what God's done for us and that like I said this part of the Year this is remembrance of what God's done for us the whole year he's let us live as our brother said man he's he just let us get be here he's let us not just be here but be in the best message in the face of the Earth the best people the best people on the Earth why would you want to be somewhere else my word for this cause many are weak and sickly among you many sleep for if we would judge oursel we should not be judged but when we are judged we are chasen of the Lord that we should not be condemned praise God with the world that's right pulled apart separated from the world wherefore my brethren when you come together to eat t one for another and if a man hunger let him eat at home that you come not together into condemnation and Paul says arrest will I set in order in other words when I come back to you Corinthians I'm going to set some things in order straighten some things out because you remember the reason he said that is because they were having a drunken party making at the Lord's table and he said no don't do that if you need to eat you go eat at home you go drink at home we're taking communion all right so let's t for just a moment the prophet of God said Terry he said pray for your pastor pray for brother Dale pray for all the the ministry around the country that's going and preaching the gospel and and you are the ones behind pushing them are actually pulling them you pulled on the gift tonight and you got exactly what you deserve amen amen you got what you deserve tonight and I appreciate that I thank God for a man of God that'll do that so let's T just for a few moments before we take communion thank you Lord Lord I pray now that you'd be with us

he said when a black man and a white man gets drunk he said they your best of friends it don't matter what you do it don't matter what color you are they'll hug your neck they'll kiss them on the cheek that's the way we ought to be in the Holy Ghost not matter about color brother Joel called the other day and he said to tell you tell you hey God bless you they had their dedication a couple

want to say again God bless you we love you with the love of the Lord I want to thank each and every one of you for coming to church here you make this your home God bless you if you're visiting God bless you too and and be really careful probably be really foggy outside but uh we know the Lord will take care of you be safe on the highways um if anybody wants to stay and and can't don't think they can go home and they need a motel just see us and we'll we'll try our best to take care of if you don't want to drive home um cuz I want us to uh I want us to be safe and brother Wayne is going to love you tell them love you godess thank you my brother he poured his heart out now we pray that he's going to have a a good night's rest he's going on to brother Steven Shambo in the morning to preach for them and I hope we enjoy oursel tomorrow y'all can stream in on somebody else tomorrow you can you can U uh get on there and and watch somebody else cuz I'm sure some people don't have watch not service but they're going to have service tomorrow so um be safe really though be be safe on the highways yeah thank you for explaining about sitting heard yes that's what Paul did well Paul came to the Corinthians and of course Corinthians is what the book of Correction so he found the Corinthians and they're worshiping this Idol worshiping that Idol and he's saying okay we need to have the Lord's Supper well he leaves and comes back and when he comes back to Corinth they're just spreading it out eating chicken and and mutton and you know probably hummus and um anyway felt dizzy right there for a second but no they were they were eating just a regular meal they just come together and said well we're just going to end then they were drinking he said drink you know take wine well they were taking it but they weren't supposed to do it like that and that's why Paul had to say I have received of the Lord I've received this from the Lord this is not my opinion cuz Matthew could have had a an eyewitness opinion of his side of the story remember because he saw one blind man and and saw two or or vice versa whichever one it was and there was a different angle but not with not with a communion God wanted it to be instituted one time so he took a prophet and he set a prophet down and he showed him the whole communion he said because I received it from the Lord I didn't receive it hear say he said you need to do all this but now right at the end he said if you want to eat you better eat it you need to eat at the house because You' not to come into condemnation they were they were being that's why he kept saying he said don't eat unworthily don't he said you'll you you'll bring damnation to yourself you're going to bring sickness you're going to bring things upon yourself but if the coren took correction they did it right right and that's the same way with me and you when we were in denominations what did we do we had well some don't even have communion but we had what grape juice and and the grape juice that Mom and Dad at the Baptist Church in the 60s they would water it down it was so Well's grape juice is pretty strong I guess but they would they would water it down well see that's water that's a type of them watering the word brother John they weren't taking even the right communion and and they were watering down what they weren supposed to do so it was a double jeopardy and then they were they they bought these little Wafers and ain't no telling they was probably made by whoever in the world smoking cigarettes and drinking beer and partying all night but they was making little bitty squares mom and them would thaw it out Bo you talking about hold over that's why we don't hold that over see tonight before the morning comes I'll take that and I'll burn it where nobody can can can eat it cuz a Mana was never held over if it ever was held over it what it got wiggle Tails brother Brown said you know it it rotten so that's why we don't hold the word over we get new word as brother as my brother was telling us it's the old corn of the land but it's in the new land but it was what was grown already in the land all right so that's why we take the real communion the real purpose of the communion and we don't do it like they do cuz you know when Mom and Dad they only throw out so many little little Wafers and then they would put the rest of it in the box and freeze it right mom you put in the freezer hold it over till the next three or four months or 6 months or whatever so they were holding over their Revelation just wasn't right but thank God for Revelation thank God for a prophet that told us what to do right everything he gave us everything we needed to do the right thing amen so let's if you want to go ahead and if you want to sing some more I'm fine I feel good amen I'll be 63 in about 4 weeks so I still feel good I feel real good amen some of y'all don't you oh if you want to stay you're welcome to stay but we're going to sing some more we got a few more specials brother L do we was did anybody want to anybody want to listen to the the special there's a few more left okay a few if you want to stay that's fine if you don't you can head on back to the house whichever you want to do but we'll stay here as long as you want to if you want to sing you would sing till 3:00 in the morning I don't care okay I know some of you old people got to leave so God bless you yes oh there's plenty of food might be there's enough for an army down there so please eat it take it home with you but try to eat it while you're here it's kind of hard driving down the road and eating food all right be careful but God bless you we love you let's pray before we go dear heavenly father father Lord we just want to beig family and we appreciate when someone comes into to our sanctuary and pours his heart out like our brother did the last two nights and Lord he brought you more real to me and to each one sitting here hallelujah and I thank you for that Lord I told him standing back there a few minutes ago I said this will be a different Church than it was last year just because of what we've seen tonight and last night there'll be a new Zeal there'll be a new revelation just as the the hold over of the bread we're not going to hold it over we're going to fresh bread new revelation but all that wine that grape juice will spoil but that wine just gets better with age so the Holy Ghost will get better with age may we grow to mature Christians this year Lord may that be our desire that that we may be have come to life Lord I thinking today we baptized 20 people and many have come and said that they've received the Holy Ghost this this year and receive Revelation well father I pray that that the ones that have come to life as our brother saying go that next step and I hope the people understand that that's the statue of a perfect man cuz you can't walk when you're bound but when you're boed by virtue knowledge Temperance patience godliness brotherly kindness brother Brown said we'll be a living moving moving Tabernacle of a living God we're not a statue we're a stature of a perfect man father just be with each one be with the deacons the elders be with brother Dale be with the ministers that Minister here father the ones that come Among Us Lord we pray that should be with them brother Dutch and the different ones Lord from different Church churches the group there in in lincolon Lord we pray that you'd bind them closer together and give them fruit for their labor father and everybody else this involved if we forgot somebody Lord we're not doing it intentionally but I pray that you'd bless each one Lord just be with us in the further of this service and the ones that have to leave be with them on the highways Lord may we come together again Lord on Wednesday night and we'll give you all the praise and honor and glory for it in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen God bless you continue singing or you can you can go get something to eat and come back up here let me it we be open until you're until you're ready to go home so brother Lis is [Music] your child of sorrow and of wo it will joy and come forgive you take it everywhere where you go precious name oh how sweet
