musicians are getting seated um brother Bob will be speaking for us Wednesday night Lord Willam after the service today this morning we'll try to cut it a little short we're going to have communion and foot washing uh this morning service because this afternoon we're going to come back at 2:00 and have a a semi-normal service um we will U I have a I'll I'll say a few words and then what the prophet said and what the Bible says about worship and then brother Joe Canada will take over and um we'll see how this goes I I'm just uh really impressed on on um us coming together and and worship uh it's not required that you be here but um you may miss a blessing if you're not so you just decide that all right this coming Saturday at 3:00 we know brother Andrew Glover going to be here remember remember that it's uh hot dog C June or Esther um I'm sorry sister June or sister Esther um about money if you and if you've given money uh you don't have to bring anything if you donated money you don't my wife wrote this you see this I can't read it I had to get somebody to help me if you want to contribute by bringing a dessert that would be fine that would be a appreciated by the kids which we all are kids and that'll be next Saturday 3:00 then we only have one service next Sunday brother Andrew Glover will be with us there I don't know if you've heard or not but you know we announced brother Ron Spencer had told that he uh if the cancer that he had in his eye was what it was he only had two months to live well there's a God if you had heard the testimony go to the go to the Believers testimony website it was misdiagnosed it's not even cancer at all it was misdiagnosed and one of the doctors is like I don't know why this was diagnosed this way it's just like you know a cataract or some little something in his eye and has nothing to do with cancer at all so uh listen we're fighting a defeated foe amen but the problem is what we do is when the Bible says resistance the devil and he'll flee from you we don't resist we assist sometimes we assist the devil well let's don't assist him let's resist him whatever he throws in our way he's already defeated he he's done for listen he's so he's such a deceiver he's deceived himself brother John in believing that he's going to make it through this so no listen to what Winston Churchill said he said Success is Not final failure is not fatal it's the courage to continue that counts it's the courage to continue that counts and we're going to move on we going to continue on as I say again I appreciate the the vot of confidence I know probably in my heart I know that it wasn't 100% last Sunday but that's all right those of you that don't like me then please try I'll try to help you I'm just pling this just me this is what you got but we love you with a love of the Lord don't thing I want to do I've always said before I walk out of that room right there I said God though I be a Castaway though you destroy this body though you take me out of the way bless your people I think that was my dad's vision was to see the people make it and then I'm going to carry that Vision on by God's grace and by your help we're going to carry that Vision on to the coming of the Lord um I believe that um that this was uh if we believe God Don't Make Mistakes then then then he's in all this all right so God don't make mistakes and and we do right Success is Not final failure is not fatal but it's the courage to continue so we're going to continue on with our head up not our head down we're going to continue that way uh there will be some um I want to meet with some of the um I call them the heads of state which is the department leaders and and and start working on some things but uh like I said before and like brother Aaron said Wednesday night I'm not my dad I'm not brother Dale I am brother Dale but I'm not that brother Dale and and there's some things that I don't want to change anything but there are some things that we like this afternoon work on a worship service so let's just remember these things coming up in prayer all the special meetings let's pray for them and that the Lord will lead us and guide us and that there will be not one person left in this congregation everybody make it like brother Bob said we we try not to we we try not to judge and we try not to be judgmental but sometimes the Bible comes in and and acts judgmental but the Bible says judge no one cuz listen God's the judge that's right but remember though you got to remember though that what the Saints will judge the Earth so he has committed that to us to and and and have parameters for us to have deacons and elders and pastors and song leaders so that we can the structure of the church can stay the same because listen we're all sheep like I said before we're hurt animals we need a Shepherd we need somebody to pull us together and when it gets pulled apart the wolf comes in Paul told us Grievous wolves would come in if we pull it apart brother Bri said stick together don't let that root of bitterness get in don't don't let some little idea or something maybe that if I say something to hurt your feelings I'm going to apologize already from now till we go out of the Rapture go in the Rapture okay so I don't have to ever apologize again because I'll be apologizing every service but I love you all you know that I hope you know that I love every one of you and I want I want us all to make it I don't disclude I include amen so let's let's get started real quick because I'm going to try to get finished by 7:30 we'll have communion and foot washing we love you like I said with the love of the Lord you just pray that God will have his will and not my will but thy will be done but we're going to talk a minute we may have to skip through this real fast on the people of Ephesus because the people of Ephesus is like the people standing in front of me today because there the alpha bride and the Omega bride Jesus says right here he says look I was in the spirit on the Lord's day and heard behind me a great voice as of a trumpet saying I am Alpha and Omega which Alpha is the first letter in the Greek alphabet Omega is the last the first and last and what thou seest write in a book and send it into the seven churches so we know that we're part of those seven churches because we're in Lea we're the last one there is not another one the Lord Jesus is coming you may have heard that sometime in your childhood but he will come one day and I believe that all the signs point toward real soon all right and I turned to see the voice that spake with me of being turned I saw seven golden candlesticks and in the midst of the seven candlesticks one likened to the son of man listen he never left us he went away to take his body into another dimension but he sent the Holy Spirit back the same person back to be inside of me and you and he's going to see this through he's got his hand in every bit of it he's not going to take his hand off he got his hand in every bit of it he loves his bride he loves his children right clothed with the Garment down to the foot and gir about the PS with a gold and girdle Revelations 1:16 he had in his right hand Seven Stars and out of his mouth when a sharp to wedge sword let's P our head just for a minute Lord thank you so much as we were watching that testimony Lord back in the office Lord of brother Ron and sister Connie what a trooper what a warrior of the faith somebody that we can look to as as you even gave us a man named job in the B I know job probably didn't want to go through all the things he went through but God put him through it for a purpose so that we can look at that man job and know Lord that you are the Redeemer he stood and said I know my redeemer liveth even all that that he went through losing everything he had but yet he stood true to his faith and father I pray that we do that we stand true to the word of God that we not differ from it that we not compromise with it it that we'll preach it and receive it Lord as you give it father be with the ones that are sick forgive us of our sins bless the ones that are in Foreign Fields Lord I heard from many of them this coming this past week and I pray that you'd bless each one Lord it brings back memories of being over there Lord I pray that you anoint them Father for the service that they do Lord just bless us in Jesus name amen God bless you you can be seated so the mystery of the Seven Stars is what God's got this thing in his hand he takes seven people now listen God's not the author of confusion God's not he everything is in order that's right so he's got seven men he brought seven Church ages he had Seven Cities and they all were a pattern of the Bride of Jesus Christ he said what thou sawest are the seven churches and what the stars in his hand is that God he rolled out number one he rolled out Paul irenius Martin Columba they just came straight from the logos which is God himself which is the speech of God he stood there and said I'm going to have seven Messengers and those seven Messengers are going to be the seven churches or church ages that have different characteristics but yet all one common goal and that's to go to heaven right and that was God's goal you know God listen the Bible says that hell was created for the devil and his angels hell wasn't created for humans but you'll decide to go there if you don't trust the word of the Lord cuz hell's real listen the devil's real hell's real don't let nobody tell you that not everybody that dies is going to heaven I'm sorry I that just the way it is but if you'll accept the Loving Grace of Jesus Christ you'll be there so the seven churches is a complete and final revelation of Jesus Christ to the Gentile Nations now we know that God's going to remove himself from the Gentiles go to the Jews and take 144,000 which I believe like you believe they're over there now some of them may be fighting over there now but they're going to be 144,000 and those two prophets are going to preach this message to that group of people and tell them they missed it you missed the Messiah and then God's going to what he's going to as he did Paul he's going to take the scales away from their eyes and they're going to see that and think man we've had it now oh we've had it we we killed him 2,000 years ago and we've been looking for him and we already killed him and he's gone and come back and you know what go they're going to the two prophets are going to say hey that's okay it was done for a purpose it was done to get me and you to get a gentile bride out of the loins of God into manifestation so that you and I can be God manifested on Earth as a bride all right everybody with me on that so now this is the way it's going to happen and we'll run through this real quick there's an announcement in heaven all right out of the mind of God comes to logos in word in other words if it comes from God it's perfect never will fail never will fall on deaf ears if you'll listen he that have the ear let him hear you got two ears in one mouth it'd be nice for us to listen twice as much as we talk praise the Lord I'll raise my hand too brother Donnie but somebody's got to do it a sealed a sealed message is open so something that was in the mind of God that he had before the foundation of the world it opens up and he says okay I'm going to take this star I'm going to give him this certain message and I'm going to unfold that message to the star of that age which would be Apostle Paul for the first age that messenger picks up the logos of God listen the logos spoke to Paul on the road to Damascus cuz he said Saul Saul why are you persecuting me who's me me is Jesus Christ Paul knew he hadn't met Jesus Christ he just did yes but in a form called a bride is who was persecuting the Believers and that struck Paul I believe because he was a learning man he knew that the Messiah was coming but he just didn't think that was who that was well he had a conversion and maybe that's what me and you need we need a conversion we need a Damascus Road to get us knocked off of our high horse everybody with me today all right so a trumpet sounds in other words he gives it to Paul Paul just didn't say 30 years no he began to speak and he spoke so positive he said you'll be judged by my gospel you'll be judged by by what I say because what it come from the mind of God same way in the end time we have a we have a an alpha which would be Paul and remember a lot of those sermons that people preached were never written down it was just given from ear to ear or or mouth to ear right but Paul 80% of his was the New Testament he wrote it down so that we could read it guess what we got a messenger over here that we got 1,00 sermons that were written down so that we can see what the Amplified version of what Paul was preaching not a different version come on somebody it's not different but the same thing Paul preached is what brother random preached and if Paul made it he's going to make it if Paul's people make it we're going to make it but listen to turn that messenger down though is death I'll read it to you in a minute so a trumpet sounds a message it's not a toot toot toot it's a message Paul goes down and starts preaching we'll see in a minute where he just he goes to the upper coast of Ephesus and he starts talking to the people and they catch a revelation and Buddy the Holy Ghost falls on 12 men and those 12 men tear that whole city apart give me 12 men and women today full of the Holy Ghost that's taught by Apostle Paul amen we'll tear this world apart so the church age begins it's a distinct in declared message is something that is for that age because each age listen God is so he's so mindful that we as humans can only take so much all right you can only take so much I was talking to somebody the other day you know you if you took somebody like say even Albert Einstein as great as he was he passed away like in the 50s or 60s early what if he was here now to see all this technology all what he done listen everything Albert Einstein done he done with a pencil or or uh chalkboard with chalk right now we got a computer that can store everything he said in your watch right bring him here and he would be so astounded till he probably would say oh that's not real or that's not no he was born in this age to where that had to be you and I were born in this age to where we're supposed to be we're supposed to be in this age CU you're sitting here today amen all right and we're a chosen group of people God before the foundation of the world saw you'd be sitting here today so you're going to hear a distinct and declared message today that not the world gets not even the denomination not even the the world Cosmos the world the seven billion now it's 8 billion people will never hear this gospel millions billions of them will never hear what you hear but what are you going to do about it so remember though when when that opposition comes or when Paul comes and brings his message immediately Satan comes and brings opposition it's always that way when when God put Adam and Eve in the garden of Ed and said here hey you you got this whole thing Adam you're the controller I'm going to leave you alone I'm going over here I I'm going to rule the universe you you just take care of this ball called Earth all right well we know what happened Satan dropped right straight down into Eden and did what he did with Eve give her a false Doctrine and that's what started this whole junk that we're dealing with right now amen born in sin shapen in iniquity spouse of my mother's womb of liar we needed a transformation we needed a knocking off of our horse we needed a scale off of our eyes and somebody lay our hands their hands on us to receive the Holy Ghost like just like Paul did so it starts a spiritual war the true word of God versus false Doctrine Paul even tells he said Grievous wolves I'll read it in a minute Grievous wolves will come in all these things are going to happen and and like brother R says he said the seeds of of error started in the first church age right the seeds of deception started in the first church age that vine started growing in that church age and it intertwined through all the other Church ages to where you and I are over here where where Jesus said hey let it alone he's talking about me and you he said let it alone let it grow amen cuz you may cut something down that's good Let It mature praise the Lord let it mature and when it grows up you'll see the two Vines you'll see the True Vine and the false Vine but they're going to be so close till they deceive the very elect if it possible but if you're an elect you can't be deceived I said if you're the elect so then Paul brought his message they cut his poor head off they laid him away he was taken off the Earth but the message continued through the preachers and fivefold Ministry of the of the beginning because that's where it all started he gave some apostles who was saying that Paul right that's Ephesus or Ephesians so The Messengers laid away then what does God do he brings another one but he br BRS that you accept it or reject it it brings a judgment on the people or a plague as we were talking about last week where now that we see that you you know you go to some of these places and and they're just spiritually dead right but let's wonder about ourself now let's be spiritually alive right here don't worry about being spiritually dead out there let's worry about it being here because remember the seed of Satan we're going to look at in the church the seed of Satan came in so close he wants you to worship him in this building right here that's right he don't want you to Worship in the barrooms or in the prostitute no he wants you to worship you right here worship him right here as God CU that's a great deception but you and I will not be deceived if you are elect if you are bride if you'll listen get the baptism of the Holy Ghost know that you got it so it's spiritual death to the ones who reject their message then the next stage it's the same identical pattern there's an announcement in heaven here come irenius he didn't have a different message in Paul but he did have a little more to it than Paul did but you didn't see irenius didn't write his down and then Martin and Columba Luther we have Luther's writings see they started writing again we have Wesley's in the age of man and then now you've got uh Pentecost and then you've got the age that we living in now and Lord of Mercy we've got more information now than anybody ever had I mean y'all know as well as I do I was looking the other day with talking about plants and what does the plant do and what there's an app on your phone now don't look at me and smile like I'm a dummy cuz I am you said right okay yeah I'm just kidding but you take your phone and you put it up against the the plant it don't only just tell you what it is it tells you how to put fertilizer and what it needs from an app and Bob can create any kind of picture he wants to create with artificial intelligence I think some of us may have that every once in a while a little bit of artificial intelligence but I've always said I don't care how smart they get with the computer somebody's got to press the button and put the information in all right so it's all begins with man and ends with man man's got so smart till they're trying to listen you know what they're doing with AI they're creating a perfect world they're taking all the imperfections out that's why they photoshop things you look at some of these girls on the Photoshop and you say man this lady's beautiful and you see in real life you go whoa well that's what it's artificial you sisters are beautiful you don't have to hide behind AI you don't have to hide behind Pain you don't have to hide behind anything and we'll look at that maybe in a minute cuz listen we can't understand the love of God you go through persecution every Church age goes through persecution but in this age you know back when Paul was alive and back in the first church age all the sisters wore dresses they cut their hair they didn't wear makeup they didn't have a and listen I work for the post office if any of y'all buy from Ulta you know what that is it's a demon that's what it's called Ulta it's Ultra demon cuz we deliver them things all over the place but I'm just joking but you got all that stuff and brother Brown called it Max Factor but Paul didn't have to deal with that he dealt with other things sure there was other demons but look at us now over here where we're going to be listen they were persecuted unto death it meant death for them to come into a church and sit down physical death and some of them were killed taken into the into the Arenas and just like just like us watching a football game they put humans in there with lines and they said whoever wins gets the prize just because they were Christians not because they were murderers and hor mongers no they were Christians and just to be called a Christian just sitting in a just sitting in a room you could be you could be killed but now see look Satan's got smarter and so has man I hope where there's laws now I was kind of mulling over that this morning there's laws now that they call what that's human rights so we have human rights over here now they' give now they' give dogs and cats more rights than we do but human rights yeah well hey you can kill a baby but you can't kill a cat come on somebody I'm going to but you come over here and you see now that they don't kill you spirit I mean U human humanly they kill you spiritually spiritual death is hit the church not the bride listen spiritual death never will hit the bride she's alive she's a million wire alive she's never going to be defeated never going to fall away from this thing listen the great falling away is not the bride that's right praise the Lord that we have Revelation so there was an age of Pentecost and we'll run through this real quick cuz I want to get to u to the people of the age so there was an age of Pentecost the messenger was the Holy Ghost on the day of Pentecost there was 120 in the upper room and they got the baptism of the Holy Ghost and they went out and they spread the gospel they listen they were not scared anymore amen you know what they were not they were believers they became believers they believed what happened on that day of Pentecost do you believe what happened cuz every one of you sitting in here today is going to have a day of Pentecost or not you got a day of Pentecost where the Holy Ghost is going to come not on you but in you and it's going to cause you to act funny on amen amen the world thinks we're crazy praise God listen the world's being run by crazy people like brother Ernie Bill W said he said the insane asylum is being rued by the insane man so anyway so the age of Pentecost we had a messenger the Holy Ghost you'll see on the day of Pentecost then we had in 1906 zza Street we had the same cuz it's the pattern we had the same pattern all right holy ghost fell on the day of Pentecost Peter was a spokesperson Paul had not come on the scene yet Paul was born but Paul wasn't he was the church agent messenger not Peter so Paul comes on the scene ad50 somewhere in there when they set the church up in Ephesus we'll read that in just a minute so in 1906 that the Pentecostals came in over here with the restoration of the gifts that's why brother rown said there was no Messenger to that age either because the Holy Ghost fell on a group of Believers the oneeyed black men param and um never can remember that Seymour daddy Seymour daddy Seymour and param they the Holy Ghost fell on them they started a Revival in the zoos of California and it spread all over the world the gifts were being restored the Holy Ghost was back into the people so the Holy Ghost come himself but then at the end of that age somebody came on a scene in 1947 called Elijah the Malachi 4 that we believe that brother William brandham is the Elijah 4 it's not a spirit it's a person listen if the first Elijah was a person the second Elijah was a person the third Elijah was a person that's what John said come Spirit and the power of Elias brother brandham was not a spirit he was a person and there's two prophets going to Israel to be the fifth coming of Elijah and it's going to be a person so it's not a spirit it's a person and we believe that he fits all the characteristics I was talking to brother Claud wer you know everybody's saying brother R's this and this and this I'm like him find me a messenger cuz we got to have one before the great and dead Dreadful day of the Lord there's somebody come on the scene and got to turn us back but remember you and I realize we've had it and we're still under it now this is the message of the hour but at the end time as it always come up we find the messenger is sent and all the Scruples and things are placed in their place then the Rapture comes for the church there is no other Church age this is it leosa is the end there's not another church age coming there's not another people to rise up there's not another there might be another million denominations rise up but there will be another not be another bride rise up this bride's going to go up anybody with me so we see all that that went on and then he even God tells him said look you've lost your first love I mean right at the beginning at Pentecost they lost their first love by the time Paul comes on the scene he looks and he says Grievious wolves have crept into the church brother Bri comes over here and he looks at Pentecostal he said you had it you had it but you tooted it out the whistle you said the gifts is it and stopped God said the gifts is it and moved on cu the gift speaking in tongues is not the Holy Ghost right it's a gift right and gifts and callings are without repentance but all those other ones of wisdom and all the different things that comes into the church to keep it clean but there's one thing they did they hated the Deeds of the nicians which I also hating yes I want to give you something today if you don't know it God hates right y he hates he hates sin he hates this right here so you know what yeah God's a good loving God yes he is is but he's also a just God he said right here he's the one that wrote this this is not listen this is Jesus talking to to John everybody with me this is not a filter in between this is Jesus talking to John that's red letter in your Bible because the writers of the Bible know that Jesus came to John and said write this John and send it to the churches right so if he said this I hate God hates he hates the deed of the nicians which we know that is Conquering the Ley taking everything out of the Le's hands and putting it all on one person which would be a pope or a viker orever how you want to say that and down through the church ages it got worse and worse and worse right brother R said right here the Holy Ghost was against a certain thing that got started in that church age and it was the deed of the nians remember niik means to conquer that's where you get the word Nike from your shoes leoty means the church so nickan is to conquer the Ley took the Holy Spirit out of the church and give it to one man let them be the boss of all I was talking to a lady yesterday at work and she's a Catholic she's born Catholic she said she was 30 something years old I guess K's about 30 31 32 she said we went to church but we didn't understand nothing it was all in Latin All in Latin she said we understood we just knew we needed to go take the Eucharist and and you know the uh give you the thing and we drink the the priest drink the wine and you go on out and just live like the devil all you want to right and the priest will be your intercessor there's only one intercessor there's only one man to take away your sins and it ain't called a priest it's called a high priest of our confession which is Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever not some Pope that's the Antichrist all right so look Acts 2 verse1 says on the day of Pentecost when it was fully come they were in one Accord as brother Bible's talking about today let's make sure we stay in one Accord if we get in one Accord the power will be back in the church the signs and the wonders if you want to see all that let's all get one let's all get together and have one common goal and that's to get out of here so we know there came a sound from heaven and there was many people there and they received the Holy Ghost and look what they did they they I want to see this right here when they prayed the place was shook where they were assembled the power of God shook it was a rumble went across they knew that God was on the scene and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost and spake the word of God with boldness not scared listen if you become a Believer half your Journey's over if you become a Believer half of it is over if you're not a Believer you'll never get there that's right but if you become a Believer that's half the journey everybody with me multitude with one heart one soul neither said any of them that ought of the things which he possessed was his own they had all things common and with great power gave the apostles witness of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus and great grace was upon them all that's your first church age all right that's your that's your people of the first church age so we're going to read a little bit more now we'll we'll study this a little bit later so Paul comes at the end of the age remember he comes at the end of what a Pentecostal age the outpouring of the Holy Ghost so where does brother Bram come he comes at the end of a Pentecostal age 1906 toza Street and starts his message all right in 1947 all right so let's watch and see what how Paul identifies that now we know the church let's go through this right here we'll get to where I was I added this in the other day Saul blessed his heart he was uh he raised a lot of have it but you know what he became a church age messenger and he became the one that we had to listen to if we were in that church age if we were sitting in Corinth if we were sitting in Ephesus we had to listen to Paul and get what he said so now watching Corinthians Paul says moreover Brethren I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you which also you have received and wherein you stand by which also you are saved look I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you look at the boldness of Paul but he knew he was where he was standing which also you have received and wherein you stand by which also you are saved if you keep in memory what I preached unto you unless you have believed in vain for I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received now what was it the lust came to Paul Paul takes it gives it to the church all right how that Christ died for our sins according to the scripture and that he was buried and that rose again the third day according to the scripture he was seen of sephus then of the 12 and just talking about the resurrection after that he was seen of 500 Brethren of whom the greater part remain un this present but some are fallen asleep we know by the time Paul writes this I want you to understand something probably over half of the of the Apostles are dead because they all died of martyr's death except John every one of them were killed all right excuse me and after that he was seen of James and all the apostles and last of all he was seen of me look Paul is standing there and if somebody in the congregation is looking at Paul and they're kind of old but they saw Jesus but they never saw Paul and Paul comes on the scene in ad50 something and they're like where'd you see him at he saw him on the road to Damascus he knew who he saw on that road he saw Jesus but he saw it through the people that he was persecuted he says last of all he was seen of me also as of one born out of due time for I am the least of the Apostles and I'm not meat to be called an apostle because I persecuted the Church of God so last of last of all he was supposed to been the 12th guy Maas was the 12th guy Paul is telling them I should have been there on the upper in the upper room instead of persecuting you I should have been a part of you so watch brother brandham now in the Deep call to the Deep this is the movie that they had a brother brandham or the the video the people right here it's not me Christians I'm just a man chief of Sinners but one born out of season to you Full Gospel people now what is he telling them he said I should have been in that 1906 isusa Street meeting when the Holy Ghost fell that's what he's saying it Paul said the same thing he born out of Due Time born out of due season to you Full Gospel people which was the 1906 Isa Street that's right but look by Grace by God's grace he lets me call you brethren and sister I love you he's trying to pull them out of that age Paul trying to pull them out of that age that's declining brother Brown's trying to pull him out of that age that's declining cuz he's bringing them a message and some heard it some didn't some came out some did not the gospel I preach which is not preached to me is not a man Paul said for I neither received it a man neither I taught it but by the revelation of Jesus Christ so now he's telling us he got it from the logos himself and he comes up here in a few minutes and we'll we'll skip through it but he stands and he tells him he says you I've listened to you and you've not added one thing to me you've not added anything to the gospel that I preach right here for they who seem to be some what in conference added nothing to me he was a church age messenger you didn't add nothing to him all right but contrarywise when they saw that the gospel of the uncircumcised was committed unto me in other words to the Gentiles as the gospel of the circumcision was into Peter for he that wrought effectually in Peter to the apostleship of the circumcision in other words Peter was a Jew so was Paul but Paul was bringing them out of that Peter was staying keeping some in that was a little bit of contention they had the same was mighty and me toward the Gentiles and when James cus John who seemed to be pillars perceived the grace that was given unto me look they gave to me and barn the right hand of Fellowship in other words the group of people that God came to the Pentecostals hello somebody the Pentecostals the pillars James cepas and John had enough sense to know that the grace was given to Paul and that they would come out with him cuz even Peter says hey Paul says some things really hard to be understood for you Paul said look I'm an apostle of the Gentiles I magnify my office then Paul tells them one day he says look you're not going to see me anymore I'm going away wherefore I take to you record this day that I am pure from the blood of any man for I have not shown to declare unto you all the counsel of God take heed therefore unto yourselves and to all the flock over which the Holy Ghost has but look he's transferring the power he's transferring the power of the message not Paul the message in Paul he's transferring that over to who overseers to feed the Church of God which he hath purchased with his own blood for I know this that after my departing shall Grievous wolves enter in among you now look they were so alive then because watch what he says not Spar the flock and uh I'm sure people in the congregation like yeah that's them people I under listen also of yourselves right shall men arise of yourselves shall men arise speaking perverse things to draw away disciples after them therefore watch and remember by the space of three years I cease not to warn every everyone night and day he preached three years this is going to happen and guess what it happened amen so now let's look real quick the city of Ephesus the ruins of Ephesus now look that City's are in Ruins today cuz it turned God down I'll tell you in just a minute and what happened was they had two earthquakes this sound familiar what's it called today it's still Ephesus it was famous for what for his Library Google their search engine was a library and if you older ones know one thing for sure we didn't have Google when I was growing up you had to go to a library remember the library bus we love that Library bus I'm sorry I was a country boy born in the 60s but the the library bus would come up to the school cuz the school wasn't big enough to have a library of its own so the library bus would come up and you'd go in there and you'd you'd get your a little card you put your name on it you they'd hold it and you'd take the book and sometimes you brought it back sometimes you didn't and um they send your mom and daddy a bill for $1.50 or something and they're like where's that book and you're like I give it a ter EP is most famous for his Library it was well he couldn't read he give it an it was also famous during its Heyday for being an important look it's an important seat of Christianity this sound familiar now remember the alpha bride and Omega Brides got to be the same they got to have the same characteristics to a degree theyby with me all right so it's an important seat of Christianity in the Roman Empire and for being a thriving Port what does Ephesus mean brother R said it means aimed at or relaxed what is Ephesus in the Bible it's mentioned in the bible several times it's the city where the Apostle Paul preached and the subject of the book of Ephesians it is also said to have been the place where Mary the mother of Jesus lived her final years he she was there John was there Paul went there James went there Timothy went there it was a seat where everybody come into the United oh coming to Ephesus and missionar from the United States are from Ephesus cuz it was a center it was the center the Ephesians were surprisingly modern in their social relations in their social media they allowed strangers to integrate and education was valued the city was famous for its in it in its day for the Temple of Artemis which was that's where the Lady Diana was at they had a library called celsus and they had a theater they had couple of couple of ballparks it received an epistle it was one of the church ages the Gospel of John when go John came back from the AIS of patmas the Little John's there they say it was written in Ephesus because John came back in his old age and he pastored the church at Ephesus until he passed away and he's buried there all right so it was a it was a seat of a fifth century Christian Council we'll talk about that maybe later on but they they there was some seeds of deception in that too the City was destroyed it was rebuilt as a commercial center declined as the harbor was slowly silted in by the river and in 16 14 it was partially destroyed by an earthquake the city felt Roman influence at once taxes Rose considerably am I saying something good or here or is it bad this is what we're living through right now and I'm going to tell you one thing I'm going to stand here and give you about two minutes of what I don't like I just started drawing my Social Security and they're taxing it devil they're taxing what's already been taxed 100 times my poor old social security check June two she dra her for me the Treasures of the city were systematically plundered hence in 88 BC Ephesus welcomed this General and when he conquered Asia he conquered all that he named his thing for Rome from Ephesus he ordered every Roman citizen to be killed 880,000 Roman citizens were killed because they were were Jews uh Romans they had a a 25,000 seeding capacity theater the largest in the ancient world these people love their entertainment hello somebody this open air theater was used initially for drama but during later Roman times gladiatorial combats were also held on its stage the first archaeological evidence of a gladiator graveyard was found in 2007 this is actually where Paul this right here Paul stood in this Arena and that's when they started screaming for 2 hours they stood up and Proclaim their God was Diana we can't set 30 minutes in a church and they can scream for two hours that their God Diana was the perfect one and the one that we rever they stood right here for two hours and cheered their best team on yeah Paul got run out of that if you're reading your Bible Paul gets run out of there because of that overwhelming deception in that Arena right there what do you think about it now it had an aqueduct system in other words it was Advanced like we are today bed watermills listen they had a sawmill that could cut marble you know how hard marble is to cut they had a sawmill and listen let me give you a duh moment there was no electricity there right Amen to turn that Sawmill had to be run by either people or water one of the two and it had to be running real fast so Diana was the goddess and she was the one that they they revered and loved and people were making money off of her Paul meets said what the SM silver smith they one of them and they're they're making little Idol and saying oh Diana's going to do this for you and today's the same thing we don't have a silver smith we have Walmart Amazon eBay well get quiet all you want to when you start talking about that that people Amazon you go everybody goes man I ordered something yesterday I know that cuz I'm the postman I'll deliver it for you but Diana was considered a triple deity does everybody understand what I'm saying there was a trinity here and she had two sisters Moon a a bride uh goddess of the Moon Luna Seline and the underworld HEC once Greek influence it caused Diana to be considered identical to the Greek goddess Artemis in other words Twins then remember I told you first century Roman coin depicts her with a unique short hairstyle and in triple form with one form holding a bow with no arrows as Brother Gary Atkins always says there's a Satan has a bow with no arrows he can't kill you we just hand him a bunch of arrows and say here shoot me with this right that's why we talk about resist and assist we assist him with the Arrows with one form holding a bow and another holding a poppy in other words drugs so now let's look at the people real quick it's 11:30 if we'll go ahead and get ready for the for the uh communion the people now look at Acts 19 it came to pass that while Apollos was at at Corinth Paul having passed through the upper Coast came to Ephesus now he's come to Ephesus for the first time he's meeting these people and finding certain disciples now remember Christianity has already come to Ephesus in other words the Holy Ghost has already fell on some because they were Believers there but this group had not heard that they were over in another area cuz they were disciples he said unto them have you received the Holy Ghost since you believed and they said unto him we have not so much as heard whether the any Holy Ghost and he said unto them unto what then were you baptize and they said to John's baptism then Paul then said Paul John be baptised with the baptism of repentance now look he didn't do away with John he said oh bless God John was wrong no John was right in the era that John was in or the dispensation baptism of repentance saying to the people that they should believe on him which should come after him that is Christ Jesus when they heard this there was no disputation they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus and when Paul laid his hands on him the Holy Ghost came on him and his fake was hung and prophesied and all the men were about 12 and then Paul goes into the synagogue and he speaks boldly for the space of three months disputing and persuading the things concerning the kingdom of God but when divers or many people were hardened and believed not but spake evil Hello somebody speaks evil of you separated the disciples disputing daily in the school of one tyrannus and this continued by the space of two years so that all they which dwelt in Asia heard the word of the Lord Jesus both Jews and GRE Greek so it was a center of Christianity now look at second Timothy but thou Hast fully known my Doctrine manner of life purpose Faith longsuffering charity patience persecutions afflictions which came unto me in Antioch Iconium lra what persecutions I endured but out of them all the Lord delivered me me the Bible says according to Paul says yeah and all that live Godly in Christ shall suffer persecution that's right but evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse deceiving and being deceived but continue thou in the things which thou has learned and has been assured of knowing of whom thou Hast learned them from in other words Paul's gospel Revelations 2:9 says I Know Thy works and tribulation listen God knows we having tribul God knows we have persecution all that live Godly in Christ Shall Serve for persecution you look at Job look at your look at your part your life that that that we suffer persecution right you go to work and you live the best you can you don't cuss drink smoke or or lie and and one of your co-workers they do that and they get promoted and you don't right but you're living a standard right amen listen we don't get away from the standard we live in the standard we're not going to do a dirty rotten deal we're not going to do that we're not going to um as sisters we're not going to act like the world separate from the world and listen that's your persecution now watch let me see it real quick and then we'll take communion I read several commentators on this and and I pulled all gleaned all this from all of them so in the first century the city of Ephesus had an environment very similar to our own modern day America it was the crossroads of civilization politically known as the Supreme Metropolis of Asia were known as what most powerful country in in the world the Roman governor of the region lived there and it was the religious center for the worship of fertility goddess known by the Greeks as Artemis and by the Romans as Diana her temple on the outskirts of the city was one of the Seven Wonders of the World economically effort was a giant you can't make this up right so are we with his strategic location it was the chief Commercial Center of Western Asia Minor its harbor brought ships from around the Mediterranean and its two major roads gave ready access to other cities along the coast and Inland Diana's Temple considered sacran throughout the Roman world became the primary banking institution in Asia Minor morally however the city was bankrupt just as our nation is in in inundated with perversion and prnography Ephesus was controlled by the educated prostitutes affiliated with Diana worship does this all sound familiar part of the cult of Diana was the use of ritual prostitution whereby the devote became joined with the goddess through her Priestess ensuring her favor throughout the year one philosopher committing on the moral climate in Ephesus wrote that the inhabitants of the city were fit only to be drowned he said that the reason he could never smile or laugh was because he lived among such terrible uncleanness it was the members of his church who lived among such prosperity and depravity that Christ addressed his first letter among seven in Revelations 2 in other words he addresses Ephesians first to the church in Ephesus Revelations 2 by the time the Apostle John recorded Jesus Christ's letter to the church in Ephesus more than 60 years had passed since the Inception of the Church of God the sprawling city of Ephesus prospered as a commercial center for the ancient world and a focal point for Pagan worship does that sound familiar the physically imposing Temple of Diana towered over the city's landscape influencing and encouraging the evil practice of magine now look this is the seed of Christianity right we're it's supposed to be clean and without all that perversion but it's the seed of both cuzz both seed were planted in the in Ephesus and they're going to what they're going to culminate whatever this is is going to culminate in this age all right amid this vital bustling and sinful Metropolis you know the world you know they they um um Prosperity is what everybody you know even now in the religious realm they're preaching Prosperity Gospel everything you know if you if you come to church and pay your tith and and God's going to just pour out a blessing he will pour out a blessing but it's not going to be probably with dead presidents on it I'll promise you that and I don't want it I'd rather have a blessing of God that's connected to me and to you that's right not money the Ephesian church was born despite its carnal surroundings the church endeavored to be doctrinally faithful now listen to its Divine founder striving to resist the influence of Satan and his false teachers Jesus letter to the Church of Ephesus contains Jesus's famous rebuke you have left your first love the Believers that Ephesus now listen this commentator was really very Frank cuz he was talking about the Believers at Ephesus now he was talking about the world before he talking about the Believers at Ephesus struggling beneath the weight of a Godless and immoral culture which we live in right now had maintained the letter of the law but had lost the spirit of the law go to Romans 2: 29 Jesus commended them for their hard work perseverance rejection of false teaching and hatred of sin but he was grieved that they had become routine in their service for him rather than serve him with the passion they once had I'm talking to lul church today their actions were there but their hearts were not Jesus's word to the Believers in Ephesus should challenge all Servants of the Lord it is easy to get caught up into busyness of Ministry Church work volunteering and not realize our passion for the Lord has cooled we are no longer prepared held into service by love but by some other selfish or worldly motivation we may think God doesn't mind as long as we are outwardly obeying but he does mind it hurts him and it violates the greatest commandment you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart soul mind and strength Jesus gave the church at Ephesus time to repent and he gives us time as well every moment we resist his call to humble oursel and return to our first love is one more moment that we forfeit the love joy and peace that he offers he's so concerned about the Church of the day they he made certain that this letter was preserved and given to me and you that was the people of Ephesus if we're the book in then that same spirit's down here but you what it's magnified it's magnified cuz look they only the the city of Ephesus had like 250,000 people well that's really not much more more than a small City in the in in in the United States 250,000 people but in that 250,000 people is all this what happened cuz it was the center and the seat of everything but look how it's spread now it's all over the world deception lying thieving all this other stuff and have we become cold have we lost our first love we're in the message what do you what do you want I want you to be in love with the Lord not in love with this messag I want you be in love with the Lord I want the Lord when you come in hear that the Lord's the one that you listen from listen to listen to his voice speaking to us and yes we are the Bride of Jesus Christ let's stand to our feet let's take communion if you'll pull that scripture up please we Sorry to run over a little bit but I wanted to it just really was astounding to look at the people of Ephesus and what they went through and what you and I go through now as today as being Christians in this last Church age knowing listen listen folks knowing the full measure of the word in this hour they didn't know the full measure that's right you and I know the full measure we can look back through history and we've got history that tells us this is what happened this is what happened this is the way Satan act this is the way God acts this the way Satan act and it walks you right on up to today if that was a seat of Satan Satan Satan wanted to get in the temple here he's in the temple over here remember he wants to be worshiped as God but listen the bride will not be deceived something is going to click inside of you and say that ain't right and you're going to flee from that resist it not assist it so let's take communion let's read the let's read the scripture we got up on the screen yeah 1 Corinthians for I received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus same night in which he was betrayed he took bread when he give thanks he break it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this do in remembrance of me after the same manner he took the cup and when he sucked he said this cup is the New Testament in my blood this do you as often as you drink it and remembrance of me for as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup you do sure the Lord's death till he comes wherefore whosoever shall eat of this bread and drink of this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord but let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup and remember we don't do like the world we don't buy our bread from somebody we have holy hands make that bread right there amen and we have that is wine that's not grape juice Jesus didn't turn to water into grape juice it Welches he turned the water into wine and wine gets better with AIDS grape juice will rot but this word of God will not rot it gets better with AIDS just like that wine right there for this caused many are weak and sickly among you and many sleep for if we would judge ourselves we should not be judged but when we are judged we are chasing the lord judge yourself today I'm not going to judge you you judge yourself whether you worthy or not to take this communion we are chasen to the Lord that we should not be condemned with the world wherefore my brethren when you come together to eat tarry one for another and if any man hunger let him meat at home that you come not together into condemnation and arrest I set an order when I come Paul writing to the Corinthians and he said look guys communion is not um what you call it um rind or or um Golden Corral that's what they were doing they were getting drunk at the L at the table saying it was the Lord's table and they was making all kind of food and everything he said no Paul said that look that's not it this is reverent this is something Jesus was fixing to die he was fixing to give his life for me and you it should be a solemn event it should be an event that the bread made with holy hands and listen that bread is not going to be something you going to say man I'll make that at home no listen Jesus told him one time he said can you bear this that I'm bearing he said can you bear this are you going to be able to Bear what I'm bearing he said yes some of you will he knew Peter was going to be crucified like him but can you bear the cross he told you to Bear one right you have a cross to bear your own must Jesus bear the cross alone and all the world go free there's a cross for everyone and there's a cross for me amen when he before he went to the Cross he said this is the New Testament in my blood this is going to be something new you're going to be able to live this it's not going to be a Ten Commandment ritual it's going to be something as brother Bob talking about something you live it's just as common as you moving your hands if you got the Holy Ghost inside of you to take this communion so let's bow our heads just for a minute let's clear our hearts out let's clear our mind out let's we we come together today to worship to do this Commandment that the lord gave us and now pray inside yourself just for a moment Lord give us strength to take this communion Lord and and may it show forth Lord that we are committing oursel to you Lord that we'll do better that we'll take this new commandment to the world and that we'll present Jesus Christ to him Lord thank you for all that are here Lord in Jesus name amen the Bible said he took bread and blessed it dear heavenly father this bread as we said was made with holy hands it was made with just water and flour Lord nothing added as the word is nothing added to Lord It's just pure and unadulterated word of God in your body Lord you it was given on a cross at Calvary Lord that went through a hideous death Lord for me and and this congregation to be able to stand here today and say we are Christians and we love you Lord for it in Jesus name amen I just thank God that we that there's truth that that we're living in truth you can reject it if you want to but we're living in true we're living in the last days we're living in the the seals have been open everything every mystery has been unfolded down Through the Ages and and through the prophet's message and and through uh Brothers like brother Bob and brother Lis brother Aaron dad different ones down Through the Ages had brought this message in Clarity not in confusion in Clarity this message was not sent now look it'll confuse the W the the the wise and and the ones out in the world but it was given to us the common people praise God for us to understand what God Said what was in his mind before the foundation of the world is now being produced right here dear Lord thank you for this wine Lord was made father to to just get better and better with age Lord as it ferments and and Lord it releases gases Lord it just stays Lord just as fresh as the day it was made father and so are you Lord let you be in our heart Lord so fresh and we'll not lose our first love that will not get away from you Lord that that it'll be a fervor that we have just like uh the wedding day father that we had in the honeymoon in the first part of our life where we just we just had a good time with our with our bride father I pray that you have a good time with us Lord and Lord I pray that you'd bless this and sanctify in Jesus name amen come morning I walk by the river I'll rest neath the Ever Green Tree I will carry my cross through the midnight come morning there's glory for me sometimes I'm despised as I was talking persecuted question oh Father how long then I take one more look at Mount Calvary and it gives me the strength to go on you know we're only given the Bible says 70 years maybe 72 years and uh of of life and some have lived more some will live less but it's only just a blip in the screen of History just just a very microcosm I mean just you don't can't even see it if you take the timeline from from uh Adam and Eve till today you know you and I were not even like a molecule in that time so why are we living why are we living here we're living here to live there we're living here for a temporary to live there Eternal so whatever trials and tribulations you know we don't don't listen we don't say bring it on but if that's what's going to get us out of here you know what happened when Israel they were just fat and happy they loved in in Egypt man they was getting all kind of straw and they was getting their mud and and and the Roman government or Pharaoh was giving him all their giving them all this stuff and they had so much time they started having a bunch of babies they a lot of leisure time so they started having a bunch of young ons Pharaoh got together with his men he said uh if this keeps up they's going to be more of them than the more of us and they going to raise up and we going they're going to be our we going to be their slave so what' he do he said on now um um you going to have to go get your own straw wow okay we'll do that rocked on a few more years and same thing kept happening Pharaoh's like got to do something else got to do something different different so he says all right you got to build your bricks without straw so you got to make those things really Compact and it's going to take you a lot longer your day is going to be longer you're going to be tired and we're going to stop this baby making stuff right but what happened is when Pharaoh was putting the pressure on the children of Israel the children of Israel were going God where your people you told us listen Our Father Joseph J brought us here remember there was famine in the land Joseph said bring all the brothers and all the brothers and there were some sisters but bring them all in here put them in Egypt and they live just oh hunky dory they had a brand new car couple of them in their parking lot they had uh full internet service and uh they had U States and potatoes

called you called a guy to work on your car it was just wonderful and every cell phone worked everywhere they went they had Self Service all of a sudden Pharaoh said well let's let's let's make the economy go up here and we're going to take care of some of this Prosperity what happened to the children of Israel brother r said the reason the deliverer came on the scene listen to me was that they got tired of where they living children of Israel got tired and said God we need a deliverer we need somebody to deliver us out of this right here you said we were your children now it's been kind of turned around to where it's like you've you've went away from us Lord no he was right there but like me and you when there's ease and Zion we're okay we're good but when persecution comes we pray more remember when 9911 hit y'all remember that when 911 hit the next day they had a National Day of Prayer no not the next day but the next week well they violated their own law they took the prayer out of the school now they want everybody to pray why cuz something happened and then churches filled up and then everybody started getting religious well guess what it's been what now 20 years right back to the same old thing exact same thing don't even stand up for the pre of Allegiance anymore they kneel down or whatever the anthem they don't they you know they turn their backs and all this stuff that man right there is fighting to keep us free but listen God fought first to keep us free we're the one that went into captivity so I God if it gives this persecution to get us out of here we need it we are your children Lord we are the children of God he's put Israel away divorced Israel but now he's taken a bride and you and I are the last thing that he's taken off this Earth before he goes back to the Jews so even come quickly Lord Jesus let's take let's while they're taking it up let's read the uh the scriptures for the uh foot washing and and we like I said we appreciate all of you coming being with us let's read the footw watching scripture and then we'll go downstairs and and remember we'll start at 2:00 I know it's a little rushed but we'll start at two and we'll have just about a 30 minute I'll I'll speak for about 30 minutes on worship and then brother Joel will take over and explain to you what we're going to do this is going to be kind of new to us so it may be a little um it may seem like it's a little Calamity but it won't be after we the next two months from now we'll we'll get it right but I think we need to spend a little bit of time working on worship so that will be at 2:00 and then um try to keep listen when you're up here I'll instruct you this afternoon try to keep your talking down I know you got to talk about where what key and where to start at

want you to worship too the worships got to come from the people these things don't worship they're used by people they're used by Believers to help you worship so let's pray for them just as much as you pray for your worship let's read the foot watching scripture and the sisters go to downstairs soon as we're finished and then we will take a break till 2:00 supper being ended the devil having now put in the heart of Judas his carriot Simon's son to betray him Jesus knowing that the father had given all things into his hands and that he was come from God and he went to God he rises from supper and laid aside His Garment and took a towel and GED himself and after that he poured water into a basin and began to wash the disciples feet and the wipe him with the towel where with he was GED what about the Creator washing his the feet of the cre created he rises from supper and laid aside His Garment oh then cometh to he Simon Peter and Peter said un him Lord do thou wash my feet always Peter Jesus answered and said unto him what I do thou knowest not but Thou shalt know Hereafter Peter said unto him Thou shalt never wash my feet Jesus answered now look how plain Peter was but look how plain Jesus was if I wash thee not thou Hast no part with me Simon Peter said unto him Lord not my feet only but also my hands and my head as brother Dell always said the two dirtiest things your hands and and your mouth or your head Jesus saith to him he that is washed neth not saved to wash his feet but is clean everywh and you are clean but not all for he knew who should betray him therefore he said you are not all clean cuz Judas was still there so after they washed their feet and had taken His Garment was set down again he said unto them know you what I have done to you he's asking him a question you call me master and Lord and you say well for so I am if I then your master and Lord have wash your feet you also ought to wash one another's feet for I have given you an
