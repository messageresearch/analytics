thy hand all the brothers and sisters gather together here Lord to Worship You Lord you pray we pray Lord that you'll bless each and every one of them Lord in the name of Jesus we pray amen please be seated I express you the desire of her heart that the Lord has really how as a whole family has led us to come to Israel and the Lord was moving on behalf of us in the hearts of our brothers in in United States I told you that it's been almost 22 years that I could not come to States and to have fellowship with the Brethren but I had a good relation with brother Humes and their family so one in the 1997 dad Humes had been to India and that time I met him but when he came back here then he got sick and you all know that he's on bed and he's in the nursing home then he had a great desire in his heart that he wanted to meet me one time before the Lord takes him away and he Express that desire to brother team many a times and brother team called me few uh uh 2 years back or something and he says brother dad is on on the bed and he's suffering with Parkinson's disease and the dad has very much desire to meet you before the Lord takes him my way so I did not put much of a thought on those things and I said brother I will be praying and uh I'll see how the Lord just makes my way because I had put before the Lord in the back days whenever I come to come to United States in those days in 1981 to 87 I always paid my way I always purchased my ticket to come to States even for the first time when I came in 81 I bought my ticket and I came to United States I preach here had a good Fellowship of the Brethren met many Brethren and Lord just blessed me and by the way the they offered me the gifts on offerings and that made to make my payment of the on on the ticket you know and I could get that b back but nobody sponsored me as as uh to come to United States so then I I just kept in the Lord and I said Lord I'm not going no more to United States unless and until somebody pays my ticket I I just let left it to the Lord and I said Lord I'm not going and I was just like that and it's been almost 22 years and brother team came to Israel 2 years back with brother uh brother Jos Smith and the group there and my sons they went to their hotel where where they were staying and they spend the evening time with them they had a good fellowship and they talked on many of the things there and then brother te on the group they came back to his States then again he called me to India I was that time in India so he called me and he was very glad to meet my sons and he says brother I wish I could meet you but uh he said then he expressed that you come over come to States uh one time and then he Express the desire he says we will pay the ticket for you and I said Lord that's the answer and still I couldn't come I had many things to be done then this February he came to Israel by himself he was on his tour to go to n uh to uh some place in uh Africa and he knew that I was there in Israel so he called me and he said brother I'm making a a special trip I have to go to Africa but I'll come first to Israel I'll be with you I'll spend some time with you and then from there I'll go to Africa I want to meet you personally so I said well brother you come you're most welcome and it's your own home I said you come so he came and he stayed with us and we spent some time in fellowship and we just Shar a lot of things and then he said brother now you must make a point to come and to see Dad I said okay now the time has come and when I went back to India in Fe in March after meeting brother brother Tim and the Lord just put these thoughts in my heart and when the Lord put these thoughts about we being a church in Israel then I said no I have to go to States and meet the brothers because the Indian ministry we handled those Ministries in India and we did good and Lord blessed us and helped us in every way but when to start the ministry in Israel it's a little bit hard on us we because in in Israel if I have to start a Ministry I cannot start in my home because we are living among all the all the Jewish people all around us you know we are living right in the in the people in the in the apartments where we have we are living is every everywhere left right up and down in the apartments there you know all is all the Jewish people we live in a right among them and if we start a congregation like there in those place it's not good and we may be in difficulty so we have to have rent a a small hall or small place where we can bring the people together and worship and to start that first of all I have to get registered with the government obious Israel and it's going to take more money that we could spend on on the mission on the work in in India and this uh other place so we had I had been praying and then I thought and the Lord just put me in my heart that now is the time that I need a support from the brothers in the States because it's difficult in Israel my my sons actually couldn't buy a house in there so they had to rent a house and we are the boys are paying two bedroom um two bedroom flat $1,000 $1,100 per month it's it's expensive in India in Israel and to buy a house it's more expensive and the things are not that good for at least for this time of uh the time for my children to buy a house or to make some arrangement to start a church church or to place where I can get the brothers to come together so we'll have to rent a house rent a hall or some place and to rent a rent a hall it certainly needs a good money there are churches the I talking about you about the mic churches mic groups and there are some groups that they are going there that uh holding their meetings they express their desire that that we come together with them and share that Hall but at at the same time they said the time which is allotted them he said we take a half time and you take half time you bring together all all we come together and worship together you can preach one hour and I will preach on one hour but I said no because I know that when we start preaching see don't people those people will not be able to stand it and then you know the things will not be right and we'll have to separate so I I told them no I'm sorry I said I cannot do that because when I look U you know the times to come then I I said it will not be a good thing because when we separate see there are there two things happens either you pull the people from him or he pulls the people from you you know and it won't look good you know because uh if the people from his group likes to join us then it will be a difficult you know and then you will have a bad name you know among the groups and among the churches so I told them no brother I said if at all I have to start I may just go with a small little place where we can gather the people and start there so when I go back we are looking forward to find out a good place that we could get into it and get registered with the government and then we start the uh Outreach people and and start the congregation there so I want you all to pray for that and if the Lord leads you you can share your part in it and it will be a very great blessing and we're looking forward in the days to come that if the group comes from here like the last time the people come Lord willing you'll find a place to come together and to Worship in in in the message and in the faith that we have received and that will be a great blessing and so then I decided so no this is the call of the Lord that the Lord has made through dad Humes and through R tee him for me to come or to State and he paid my ticket not only me he paid my wife's ticket also so it was just on on the way you know and the Lord just answered my prayer I said Lord thank you for answering my prayer so it's been a great blessing for me to come over here and to meet different this time when I come almost every place I went are the new brothers very few in all the old times I talked to Brother D and I said brother uh those those brothers that I used to have fellowship with in the in the'80s I said they are all now the old-timers like brother how Carol brother Jess tble and brother Jerry Ro and brother Albert green and brother Wilson Henry has just gone to to son it's almost like to some other country is gone so you know it's getting difficult you know to meet but now by God's grace that I could come in fellowship with different new brothers that really I know are are going you know strong in the faith in the word of God in the message and I'm very glad to see the situation now is being changed in the United States that time when I was coming here I had a lot of difficulty in getting along with the brothers because because lot of things that time had been spreaded Out Among the brothers in different different kind of teachings you know everybody wants to take something out of it out of the message of brother Bram and and to say that no I got this thing I don't want to mention those things but I had a very you know bad experience on those years and you know that kind of made my heart sad and I just stayed back home you know in India I said Lord I don't want to get involved in such kind of in any kind of things you know something might jump on you and if you take that back home in India it's gone I know and the churches in India uh are and the message people in India are right now are in many places don't have proper teaching and have in in a different kind of ideas and and the thoughts that the the brothers have taken back to India so I thank God that the Lord I always uh tell the Brethren and and myself I observe this thing as the prophet says that walk in the middle of the road and I always like to walk in the middle of the road and I'm thankful to the Lord that if those days if I would have just said to the brother okay praise the Lord Brother amen what you are saying is is the message you know you understand that you know I could have just clicked to them and I would I in somewhere else you know today but I praise God that the Lord at the which place the Lord has kept me I'm thankful to the Lord that I am honest to him whatever you know things as the the children saying that whatever things come on my way you know I'm going to be you know with the Lord I'm going to stay there right in there and that's been my experience that this my life has been my Ministry and the Lord has blessed us in those things so pray about it and the Lord will surely lead you to do something for Israel the part of the body of Christ that's going to start in Israel it's already started we are there as an we are there eight people now uh my three sons daughter myself my wife my daughter-in-law my Elder s Elder son's wife and our one one grandchild so we are there and we are more than three people two people the Lord says where are two or three are gathered in my name it says I am in the midst so that's the church so I believe that the Lord has started his work in Israel and we pray that it will continue to to go on to go on till the Lord comes there and and takes his bride away because this is the time that everything is just coming to the end right praise God Amen the message as we have read this scripture it says in the Hebrews 10th the first verse it says for the law having a shadow of good things to come and not the very image of the things see Paul here is talking not about the image not about the Shadows but here he's talking something good things that has to come amen right means he is looking beyond the things GL which already happened in the past but they are the shadows and brother Bram preach and Paradox and he says the Shadows are not the real but they give you the idea or tells you that what the the image belongs to like if the shadow of the elephant is then then you can know that that's the ele elephant and that's the shadow of the elephant but the shadow is not a reality reality is the original amen and we are looking for the original things right but the shadow gives us an idea amen it it expands our imagination it tells you something that's beyond that shadow right and that brings then it brings you to the reality and that's how here the Paul is specially mentioning about the things of the past he says there those images and those Shadows which were in the back days and he's mentioning then about the sacrifices they offered so means he's linking those shadows and the images for in the back days and through the scripture this evening I like to bring you few shadows and then the realities which are given in the Bible I gone through by God's grace turned pages and pages and the Lord has shown me the Shadows that has become the reality in the New Testament we know every one of us knows that the New Testament is the Fulfillment of the Old Testament right and that means that the Old Testament is a shadow right of the good things and good things are the Messiah right our savior here his sacrifice the Salvation God come down in human flesh God in us and then we see the Shadow and the in the reality then we see of the coming of the Lord so that's the reality the shadow is the Old Testament I like to just bring you a few things out of the scriptures the start to start with we see that God Called Moses and then he send him back to the children of Israel and to the Pharaoh and then he said that you take a lamb and you kill the lamb and take the blood and apply on the doorpost and then it says that's your Passover that's your Passover so the blood which is on the doorpost that will save your lives as the angel will pass through that door through over that house and the death will not be able to enter into that house right because that blood of the Lamb is there and that's how when we see in the word of God that that shadow that was a shadow that was not the reality that was how the Lord was teaching his people that without the shedding of the blood there is no forgiveness of sin there is no life life if you have to have life you have to have the shedding of the blood and then the God was taking that pattern that shadow that image to the Passover of Jesus Christ right that's what we have in the book of Corinthians Paul says that Jesus is our Passover amen exactly so this was the shadow but this was the reality right this Shadow couldn't take away the sin but this reality could take away the sin and permanently right not for just for a year because every year they come now now in Israel there is there is a um yon kipur right the day of the atonement see every year they come back and they kill the lamb for the remission of the sin of the whole nation so every year there has to come but now when the reality is come it's no more sacrifice now because that's the reality that's the truth that's that's that's the original sacrifice and that was shown in Shadows to his people but the reality was Jesus Christ amen that he is our Passover and whosoever taketh that blood that death he will pass over to life the Lord says that whosoever believeth on me has passed from Death unto life right so now no more death on his people come on not even the death the second death come on he says whose whose names are written in that book of life he says they are not under that second death they have passed from Death un life amen and we have entered into that life we have received that salvation we have received that forgiveness of sin because of the reality which came 2,000 years back amen the Lord said gave those Shadows gave their images to to see the original to see the reality and they looked and looked and unto that sacrifice on the cross on that doorpost the blood was on their doorpost then the scripture says then if we go further then the word of God says that Moses took them through the waters that is the sea the the Red Sea when they passed through the Red Sea the waters were on the both side and the sky was above them what is that the scripture says in the Corinth book of Corinthians and it says that that is the baptism of Moses that they went through right so what was that that was not the reality that was the image of the coming of the baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ they cross over through the L through the waters both the side Waters and above the cloud that was what was that that was a shadow and a image of the coming the reality of the baptism of Jesus Christ glory and here we come and we take the baptism we go right into the water amen that's the real baptism but the shadow was with Moses they took the scripture says that they took the baptism of Moses they come out then from there and they come to the Mount HB and there we see Mount siai and then they come to mount siai there we see that they the Lord came down in fire right and the whole Mountain was trembling people got scared and it was all just like a fire and smoke was coming out of that whole Mountain what was that that was the shadow shadow of the fire coming down on the day of the Pentecost amen and that was the reality so we see that the God come down in that fire and here on that mountain and here we come that God come down in a tongues and of fire and leing among all his disciples and they were filled with the Holy Ghost right so that was the original that was the reality God came down in in his people and there we see that how the Lord started his work so now here they took the water baptism they took the baptism of fire and spirit and they came to the land of Palestinian and there the lord gave that land into their hands and they fought the War through josua and KH and they took the whole land under the under their possession and then there came a time that there was no more war there was no more fight everything was peace and the scripture says if you turn with me in the Book of Joshua 21st chapter 21st chapter 43rd verse and the 45th verse excuse [Music] me and it says God and the lord gave unto Israel all the land which he swear to give unto their fathers and they possessed it and dwelt therein the lord gave them raced round about according to all that he swear unto their fathers and there stood no man no not a man of all their enemies before them the Lord delivered all their enemies into their land right and the here scripture says that the lord gave them rest roundabout amen and they were in peace there was no war there was no fighting everything was just in peace so we you see if this is the shadow then there has to be a reality and it will come into reality that the church we see was in a war right war against the principalities and the power of the demons and sinan that the church had to fight it its war and everywhere whever they go they they were persecuted they were put in prison they were beaten and Steven was killed and all this was war was going on in the in in the church and the war and the Believers were all all of them engag in this Warfare of course this was this war was not of blood and flesh but this was the war against the spirit and the principalities of which were moving in the Heavenly places so this war was going on in the church at the time of Paul and Peter but the scripture says in the book of Acts and the 9th chapter and the 31st verse and it says then had the churches raised throughout all Judea and Galilee and Samaria and were edified right the church had their rest all these years there was war the whenever they went for preaching they were persecuted beaten sick Stone uh stoned but now there come a time in the church that there the word of God says then had the churches rest throughout right in Joshua the word of God says that those people the lord gave them the rest amen and here the church the lord gave the church rest and it was AR rest in a reality in a spiritual sense we see but when the rest comes and the people are at ease then we see the people start to forsake God oh yeah then they go away from the blessings of the Lord they forget the blessing and then we see that they slip back lead goes away from the presence of the Lord and it so happened in the history of the Israelites we see that when the Lord blessed them they came to the the Palestinian land they took over the land they established their Kingdom and everything was just going on fine and there we see that they started to depart away from the Lord and then they started to worship different gods they started to worship Mo moabites gods they start to worship uh Bal gods and they started to worship esto and all the goddesses and then not only that they started even to sacrifice their own children for the moik gods and to Sun God and to Moon God so they fell away from the presence of the Lord they came out and the Lord God who many a times spoke to them through the prophets that I am the Lord your God who brought you out from the land of bondage I am the one that brought you out and still they didn't hear the cry or the warning of the Lords and they continue to do sin and sin against the Lord if this is the reality my dear friends this has to be in the church history right that's going to be a reality this is the shadow this is the image that we could see now in the church history there we see after Paul Peter gone Lord took them away and then we see few of the disciples who had the fir hand gospel received from Paul Peter and all all the apostles they walked with God in righteousness they walked according to the scriptures which was handed over to them but then in the years to come then we see the church being drifted away right the church started to have the teaching of the nians right then we see the church started to have the teachings of the balam they started to have the teachings of the jizel they started to have in the church the the house of Satan which turned if you go into the LeRon in the in all all the seven churches you see that how that that the house of uh the congregation of Satan turned into the Throne of Satan in the church so that's how the church drifted away from the original right that the original state of the church and they went away from the God and started to worship and know and to leave the word of God away and to and to start to in a different type of teachings and doctrines and and all kind of things that come and crypt into the church so this was the situation but Lord warned isres all the time that come back to me I am your lord I I am your God come back to me and the Lord sent the prophets Lord sent Isaiah long Lord s uh Jeremiah and Lord sent Ezekiel Daniel all the prophets they come in Lord s Elijah and we see that those prophets came and they tried to bring the people back to God Amen and we we see that all they spoke against the the Israel to what they were doing and the Lord wanted them to come back to him I like to read scripture in the book of Jeremiah third chapter and there you see that how the Lord has pleaded with his people right to come back to him and beginning the third chapter and beginning with the first verse I read zeriah third chapter they say if a man put away his wife and she go from him and become another man shall be shall he return unto her again shall not that land be greatly polluted but thou H has played the hairl with many lovers yet return again to me said the Lord the Lord is talking to the children of Israel and the Lord is saying that see you play hang with many laws that means the idols many Idols that that the Israelite started worshiping but here the Lord says yet return again to me said the Lord right and still the Israelites didn't return unto the Lord and we see the lord always wanted his people to come back to him amen and but then again the Lord says in the second verse lift up thine eyes unto the high places and see where thou Hast not been L Lin with in the ways that thou has sat for them as the Arabian in the wilderness and thou H has polluted the land with thy hens and with thy wickedness so the whole children of Israel was under condemnation and under that condemnation the Lord judged that land but still Lord had a Grace upon that land because of the promise of Abraham and then we see it come up the King David and King Solomon and they built the temple and Solomon built the temple and he received the promise of God that whosoever look prays uh looking to that facing to that Temple the Lord will answer his prayers amen and there was a great great fire great cloud of fire upon that that that Temple when they dedicated that Temple to the Lord so that blessing they received but what happened this same Solomon King Solomon in the in the latter part of his life he started to worship idols and he became an idol worshipper and then the Lord had to come down on him and the Lord spoke to him that I'm going to take away the whole Kingdom from of Israel from you and I'm going to divide it in two kingdoms one one will be called Israel and the second will be called Judah the kingdom of Judah and the Kingdom of Israel and so we see that in the days in the Solomon then the Lord says I'll will not do it in your time but I'll do it in the time of your son to come so when the time come then we see the Lord divided this Kingdom and this kingdom was parted into two kingdoms that was the Kingdom of Israel and the kingdom of Judah right my dear friends if this is the shadow then there has to be a reality right that's there has to be reality and that reality that we can see through the IM through the shadow and the images which were we have in our Old Testament that to come to pass into the church history right the church went into Dark Ages the church went worshiping the idols the church brought Idols into the church into the church and started to worship those Idols God sent his messages in every Church age we see that there was a messenger to that church age and God had warned them and many times the Lord said come back to your original place come back to your original place and and to your original love and he says and then he says if you do not listen to me Obe to me then I will remove your candle from the place he warned all the time and we see in the back days the Lord warned the children of Israel but they did not listen to the Lord and then the Lord has to break that Kingdom and to make into two kingdoms in the same manner my dear friends if it's to be a reality God then given warning after warning warning after warning to the Christian world then the Lord came to a place and the Lord divided the whole Christianity into two parts and that's Catholicism and the protest that's true my dear friends no more other part if you take a whole world Christian world see they are the people they call them themselves Catholics and then there are other people they call thems Protestants the God took away the the kingdom and broke that Kingdom of catholism because the catholism we see that went against God oh yeah and how that they went against God we see in the first Kings and 12th chapter first king in the 12th chapter and the 28th and the 30th verse 1 King 12th chapter 28 and 30th and it says whereupon the king took counsel and made two cows of gold and said unto them it is too much for you to go up to Jerusalem Behold thy Gods o Israel which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt and it said the one in Bethel and the other put he he in Dan and then it says and this thing became a sin for the people went to worship before the one even unto D so God divided the kingdom of Solomon Kingdom of David Kingdom of Judah and he gave one part to jobah yeah and the king jobah the scripture says whereupon the king took counsel and made two calves yeah he took the counsel of the people and made two CES of gold and then he said these are your Gods you worship them and he he one place in bethl and the other one he placed in Dan and you know because of that the word of God says it became sin to the people yeah and when he placed that Cal at at Dan Dan lost his heritance in the kingdom of God and you see in the Book of Revelation when you see in the tribe of Israel all those 12 tribes were supposed to be there and out of those two 12 tribes 1 lakh 144,000 to be brought out in that list if you check it Dan's name is not there my dear friends D name is removed the whole tribe is removed and instead of that Ephraim is put back in there so we see that this thing became sin so if this is a shadow an image then this has to be in the reality and we see that in the year 3:25 ad a counil was set right same word is used for that period my dear friends that's called the knce council yeah in the knes council they come up who were they all Idol worshippers who were they they were the people that come out from the Heathen worshippers and they came as a council and there they said together and they decided to have the doctrine of Trinity and that's how the doctrine of Trinity came in the church my dear friends they took one God out from the church right and they says you cannot understand the mystery of godhead so that we have brought you in a very simple way that God is a trinity that God is the uh God is the Father the Son and the Holy Spirit yeah and they gave that solution in you know in replacement see these cards were replacement and they gave them the replacement of the one God to Triune God then the second thing that they changed was the baptism they changed the baptism in the name of Father Son and the Holy Ghost right so that was another replacement and they put these two CS into the church yeah and the church started to worship it and the word of God says it became sin for his people my dear friends this took the things that they started to teach in the church to go against the Lord this God when these people decided to go and worship idols one time the Lord say now enough is enough now I cannot take anymore from my children Israel and it says I going to destroy my people and he says I'm going to take bring this people into captivity and send them to Babylon yeah and I'm going to destroy this Temple I'm going to destroy Jerusalem and it will be burned and then we say my dear friends that the King Nebuchadnezzar came up and he destroyed the temple he destroyed the Jerusalem and he took the people captives he took the king's captive unto Babylon for 70 years period right now we see if this is the shadow then there has to be a reality and that reality came in the Christian church age the darkest Church age and the brother says that the Catholic period that age was the most darkest period of the church history everything was just binded and they were in the prison right the the Bible itself was in a prison nobody was allowed to read the Bible nobody was allowed to take and read and interpret the Bible because the Bible was in the hands of the Catholics and all those popes and the people there so the general common people didn't have access to the scripture right they were all bounded people they were taken into captivity whatever the Pope says whatever the Catholic Church says they had to obey it they had to believe it they had to accept it and they thought that was their salvation but that was that that they were under a false things and then with see that the God made the judgment to come upon the Christian world and there was everywhere we see there was big persecution there was the killing the Christian people were killed Christian people were martyred and that's how we see the all the European people come to the United States and there they establish that United State my dear friends see how these things are happening in the in the land of Israel as a shadow and as we see in the reality in the Christian Church History this matches together but my dear friends we want to see that how the Lord brought his people back unto him Lord had given them 70 years now according to the Lord and the time the time of the coming of the Messiah was coming to closing and the time that Messiah was to appear because the scripture says in Ephesians when the fullness of the time come then Jesus was born of a woman so the time of the fullness was coming closer so when the time of the fullness was coming closer but here we see that there was no Temple because there has to be a temple before the coming of the Messiah amen because the scriptures were to be fulfilled because he was to come to the temple on riding on on on us on a moon you know he was supposed to come and the people will worship and say hosana hosana blessed is is is the the Messiah is the Lord who cometh in the name of the Lord God Almighty there that that song was to be sung that his coming was to be there then we see there was a holy of holies and there was a place of holy and there was a veil in between and that veil was to be T taken into two parts to be torn into two parts from top to the bottom so that the holy of holies be open to the people all the prophecies were to be fulfilled before for the coming of the Lord in in the temple and there was no Temple there was the people were all you know gone astray the people's minds and the hearts were not ready to receive the Messiah then how could come the Messiah so the Lord has to bring the things back to its place and there we see the Lord sent the prophet Ezra and nemiah turn with me to the book of Ezra and the third chapter and and the third verse and then the Lord sent Ezra back to Israel back to Jerusalem and when he come and it says it reads in the third verse and they set the altar upon his basis for the Fe was upon them because of the people of those countries and they offered burnt offerings there on unto the Lord even burnt offerings morning and evening right so when the Prophet come back and the children of Israel come back to land of Jerusalem they went to the Temple Mount they went to the temple side and there they looked for the place of the Altar and they placed the altar they raised the altar on its own place they could not place that altar in any other place and even now we see that another that the new Temple is to be built so they will not build the altar at any other place than its original place my dear friends because the Lord had commanded them that they will s offer the sacrifice on the place which the Lord has shown to them so they place that buil the altar to start the sacrifice unto the Lord and then the scripture says in the 11th and the 12th verse of the same chapter and they sang together co uh by cour in praising and giving thanks unto the Lord because he is good for his mercy endureth for ever toward Israel and all the people they shouted unto the Lord and in the 12th verse he says but many of the priests said and Levites and the chief of the fathers who were ancient men that had seen the first house when the foundation of this house was laid Before Their Eyes wept with a loud voice and many shouted with joy so here we see my dear friends the Lord brought them back to lay the foundation of the temple not in a different place but on the same place where they were supposed to offer their uh raise that Temple and that then buil the holy of holies and the holy place and the yard for the people so the Lord brought them together and they raised the Altar and they built the temple and then we see in the book of nem and the eth chapter book of nemah 8th chapter and the fourth and the fifth verse and it says and Ezra the scrib stood upon a Pulpit of wood which they had made for the purpose in the whole history of Bible we see the first time this Pulpit was built for nah and since then this Pulpit has been used to preach the word of God so Ezra was stood upon the pulpit of the wood which they had made for the purpose and beside him stood MAA and sha and all those people and then in the fifth verse it says and Ezra opened the book in the sight of the all people he for he was above all the people and when he opened it all the people stood up they honored the opening of The Book of the law and then we see in h in the same chapter 8th verse and and he says uh eth verse now so they read in the book in the law of God distinctly and gave the Saints and caused them to understand the reading right then nah he stood up and start to preach and then the word of God says that he read the book distinctly and gave the Saints and caused them to understand the reading and this is the way that the people were taught from the book of the law and in the word script the verse 13th and the last portion it says and the people and on the second day where gathered together chief of the fathers the PE all the people and as the Scribe even to understand the words of the law so these were people that the Lord make them to understand the law amen so now these things were to happen and now the altar was built the uh altar was raised the temple was built the law the book of the law was read unto the people and was made the people to understand the word and now when they receive the understanding of the word then comes the revelation of the word then comes the obeying the word and they obeyed the word in the same book of nemah 13th chapter and third verse and it says now it come to pass when they had heard the law that they separated from Israel all the mixed multitude oh yeah they separated from Israel all the mixed multitude when they did separated when isra opened the book of the law read distinctly gave them the right SS made them to understand and then they obey the word and the first thing they did that they separated this mixed multitude which was this mixed multitude this mixed multitude came along with the children of Israel when they left the land of pharaoh the land of bondage from that time almost more than a thousand year this mixed multitude was among the children of Israel and they were the troublemakers they are the people who took the children of Israel away from their lord and now they came and they removed all this mixed multitude and if you read in the further scripture then they removed the strange wives among them they removed the strange people from among them they separated them themselves now my dear friends they were ready to meet their Messiah right altar was raised Temple was built and the people's heart were ready to receive the Messiah because they believ they understood they read and understood the scriptures and now their eyes and understanding were open to receive the Messiah their hearts were ready they were ready to remove the mixed multitude they they were ready to even to forsake their wives which were the strange wives in scripture says and now they were ready to receive the Messiah but we see that the before the receiving of the Messiah there again something was to be happened and that was the messenger was to come in the Book of Malachi in the third chapter it says in the first verse book of Malaki third chapter and the first verse and he says behold I will send my messenger and he shall prepare the way before me and the Lord whom you seek shall suddenly come to his Temple even the messenger of the Covenant whom you Delight in behold he shall come said the Lord of host right so now we see my dear friends that this this was a shadow these were the the images the church was destroyed the temple was destroyed the people were taken into captivity there was no lawgiver there was no people to read or understand the scriptures everywhere was Darkness everywhere was Darkness the mixed multitude was right among the children of Israel and this situation was there and the Lord has to put give them the punishment the word of God says in the book of Jeremiah that lord gave them the such type of punishment that we cannot even think of my dear friends the Lord said that he shall eat the Flesh of your children when the enemies will come and and put their camps against Jerusalem and you go into the book of L Lamentations in the fourth chapter and the he lamented and he says that my young womans he say young woman he says he said they have eaten the Flesh of their bones their children the history says my dear friends that the Israelites had to eat the Flesh of their own children when the enemy came against them and had put the SI against them so that was the punishment that the Lord brought forth against his own people against his own children my dear friends now if that was the shadow that was the image now here if we come my dear friends now the time has come for our period now that we are dwelling in now we see there was no church as such to be called The Church of Lord Jesus Christ the original Church his body of Christ everywhere was Darkness everywhere was mixed multitude everywhere the teachings were all different kind of things they had already put the two CS to worship and the still the church in the today we see that worship the same CS of gold even that that doctrine of Trinity and the doctrine of the baptism in the name of Father Son and the Holy Ghost is still going on in the churches what they are doing they are worshiping the idols they are worshiping those two Idols that was taken place in the Council of n so that was the reality but now we see that we are at a place the church is nowhere it's just Lord has lord said I'll SP you out of my mouth right so Lord has already done that and brother Bram says that that the church has been already condemned and he preached that I I indict this generation for the second crucification of Jesus Christ he already has passed the Judgment upon the church people the church the cath anything now all the denomination these two sisters that Catholics and Protestants as brother as in Book of Jeremiah he says Israel you you went Hing and behind you your sister Judah also went hering so what was that the Catholics they were already called in the book of Book of Revelation as a herot yeah and now her daughters her sisters Protestant they come back and join with the WCC World Council of churches they joined with them in that fornication they are totally standing against God at this place my dear friends amen but we see now the scripture has to be fulfilled the word has to come true the plan of God has to be fulfilled right but there was no church such as the Church the true church of the Lord Jesus Christ all were mixed teachings all were mixed multitudes strange wives joined into some other denomination and that denomination doing hell lot everything was bad situation but now the time was coming that is coming of the Lord Jesus Christ and here we see in the book of Mali the Lord says that I will send the messenger and he will go and prepare the way before me and that was true in the life of John the Baptist the Lord sent the prophet the Lord sent the messenger and it says the Lord whom you shall suddenly come to his Temple oh yeah see Lord was to come to his temple in that day and there was no Temple so the Lord has to bring the prophets to build the temple and to build the altar so that this prophecy come to tr that the Lord will come to his Temple and the Lord came to his Temple he fulfilled the scripture sure right but this was a shadow now the reality is this my dear friends that the god that the Messiah the Lord has to come back to its Temple right and now this is not the temple which was build by hands and the Lord says that you you demolish you destroy this Temple and I will bu build this temple in 3 days and he was not talking about the Temple of the King Solomon or the King Herod he was talking about this Temple the body of Christ and the Lord says I will raise this body and the Lord has raised this body amen and now my dear friends in this last days as the scripture has to come to fulfill that the word of God says and it says that behold he shall come and we read in Book of Revelation the word of God says he shall come lord said I will come and the spirit and the bride said come Lord come so that scripture has to be fulfilled but here the situation of the church was not ready their hearts were not ready everything was mixed all the teachings of the word of God were mixed maist Baptist jeah seven Adventist Pentecostal all mixed multitude but there was not true bride to receive the Lord Jesus Christ exactly and so the Lord fulfilled this scripture again in a reality and Lord sent the prophet Messenger to this church age my dear friend and the Lord send that Ministry of Ezra and nemah to be fulfill for our age that was a shadow but this was the reality and the prophet came up he raised the he raised the altar the right altar where the people could come and offer their lives as a Living Sacrifice unto the Lord the people could come to Jesus and to receive that uh that blessing when they offered their themselves on this on this Altar and the Lord received those people and we see that our prayers and and our offerings went unto the Lord and we see the Salvation come back into the into the church history then we see my dear friends that the people being saved people being come in the presence of God altar is a place where the people and God could come together GL that's the place of meeting that's the place where the the Lord and God could come and we can come and meet him in the Altar and that's how the prophet built that altar glory and then we see that he laid the foundation not any other Foundation but he laid the foundation back on the foundation of Paul and Peter sure that same Foundation which was laid by the apostles there was no other teaching there was no other other Foundation everything what brother Bram preached brother Bram preached out of this Bible he preached what Paul has preached he read that Bible he read that quote the was and he opened and expanded it what was his ministry is the same Ministry was like the the uh the is Ministry what was that Ministry he come to the pulpit he opened the book of the law he read distinctly made it Saints to that word and gave it to the people in a such a way that the people could understand it he broke into pieces he broke the word unto people in a very simplic City he read distinctly he does not read missing he he does not read just here or there something like that but he said it read distinctly made it a sense to the people and not only that but he made the people to understand now we understand that what's the seven the seven Church ages now we understand what the seven seal now we understand what the marriage of du now we understand what was the original seed now we understand all the mysteries of the go of the godhead so that's been explained what was that that is the reality that was the shadow at the time of as and N but the reality is the true church true bride of Christ reality is bringing back back the foundation of the word of God to the church my dear friends amen and then the mixed multitude were removed now there is no mixed multitude Among Us my dear friends there is no mix it's everything is pure seed of God it's pure seed of wheat amen is there lying on Under the Sun so no no mixing we don't mix with the world we don't dress as the world dress we don't speak as the world speak we don't curse as the C as the world curse we we don't have the doctrines as the the the denomination Doctrine says we don't believe in the TR God or two God but we believe in one God Amen we believe in the Jesus Christ come down in human flesh and being revealed to us we come back to the word now we have we have thrown away all the strange wives we have come out from denominations that's the strange wives there no more Pentecostal R more denominate Methodist or Baptist or anything now we come to God one onone relation with Jesus we are his bride now so this was the ministry of the prophet and that was the shadow but this is the reality so what he did he said he will prepare the way for the coming of the Lord so now John the Baptist ministry was there to prepare a way and then the scripture said and suddenly the Lord will come to his Temple if we are here my dear friends and if we see through the script scriptures the Fulfillment of the scripture the scriptures being reality unto us right I could give you more scriptures my dear friends on the children of Israel see they now they are coming in a reality because reality is in the New Testament they are coming to a place where they are going to have their reality my dear friends they are coming out of the Shadow they are coming out of that image no more their eyes will be mind they will have the open eyes to see the Messiah huh amen Zakaria 12th chapter will be will be revealed to them that will become a reality for them and they will say yes this is our God Jeremiah 25th chapter and they said this is our Lord that we had been waiting for him and they they said they will look upon Him whom they have appears these things has to come to reality in the days to come but as we as a church my dear friends where we are today we are at the time where the Lord will suddenly come to his Temple right and that Temple are we my de friends amen this is the time right all things are passed all that reality already closed that Messengers message uh The Messengers Ministry is already finished he's gone by to 45 years has been passed now the only this scripture has to be fulfilled that suddenly the Lord shall come to its Temple that scripture has to become a reality now and we have approach to that place and I like to read uh 12th chapter of the Hebrews and the first verse [Music] uh sorry it says uh bless first verse uh 12th chapter first verse wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses let us lay aside every weight and the sin which doeth so easily beset us let us run with patience the race that is set before us so Paul is saying that we are surrounded with the cloud of witnesses everything has just happened according to the the plan of God everything has happened exactly what the Lord has said in the past days and the that Lord has given us Old Testament as an image and as a negative and as a shadow that we could come to know that where we are standing in the in the word of God in the plan of God and the plan of God is very clearly is revealing unto us with all these witnesses as a pillar of cloud upon us that we are at the end of the times that all these things have fulfilled now the only thing the only word word for the bride of Christ is to be fulfilled is that he the Lord shall suddenly come to its Temple amen if that suddenly happens any time my dear friends then are we ready that's the question now are we ready to to meet him those children of Israel were ready their altar was raised their Temple were built the scriptures were open to them they understood the scripture and and they acted upon the scripture they separated the mixed multitude separated their strange wives and they laid a perfect life before the Lord so that when the Messiah come they were ready to receive the Messiah my dear friends here is the church and I believe that we are at a place that we received the altar we received this temple being raised back on its own Foundation that the church brought back to its original truth my dear friends now we have understood the scriptures the scriptures has been revealed unto us all the Mysteries has been revealed to
