========================================

thank you now this morning I would like to read from Hebrews chapter 12 verse 14. thank you before we get started let's just go to the Lord in prayer real quick well we thank you for the day Lord continue to serve you Lord Jesus that you've given us and thank you Lord Jesus for the opportunity to read your word and find ourselves and see more about you and your word Lord and I pray that you'll open that to us this morning God be with us in the service today Lord and remember by the way in such a junior orders and ministries of your Scots will be with us this morning I pray in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ Hebrews chapter 12. power piece with all men and holiness without which no man shall see the Lord I wanted to talk about the topic of Holiness this morning because it's been a subject that I I just been meditating on a lot lately and you know by the way he's been covering the uh after you received a new birth and then you move up to the Statue of perfect man as these attributes that are part of God or begin to be made manifest in you from Faith to Virtue and knowledge and all up but I I this morning I just want to take a step back and look at before these attributes can even be made manifest holy what what has to take place first and I think sometimes uh not so much in teaching because I know this has been taught over and over in this church and we all should be well versed in these topics but maybe sometimes in our own mind we begin to kind of gloss over the importance of sanctification and Holiness in our life and Holiness isn't just something that uh is just a phase in your life where first you're Justified and then then you become holy Holiness begins to be born in you and then through your the new birth uh is completed and you begin to move on up in the statue for perfect man but Holiness is something that it in in Luke 175 uh Luke Jesus told us that you should live all of your days in Holiness and righteousness that your whole life should be just rawd in a holy living and living a Pure Clean life for God and before these virtues can be can be brought forth before God can step into you his person then first you've got to live a holy you've got to become holy and I want to just take a look at how that happens and why that's so important this morning you know when you uh a lot of times just listening to conversations of people over the years A lot of times the metric that people use to gauge whether someone's really a Christian or not or whether a church is really a Christian Church where they want to make their home is because they come into the church and they look around and see the Holiness of the people to see whether they really desire to see more of God to see whether they whether they're approaching it in the right way to see what their approach is you know the approach is so important the the way that you come to God the way your motives and objectives and and uh you know just to listen to people's conversations over the years I I remember uh one sister that years ago talking about another church that you know they they didn't want to go to that church because the pastor years ago hadn't married somebody of a mixed race or whatever and this this little things like that that they used to people people gazed to see how concerned you are for the word for the keeping of the word and that's how you gauge a minister to what why would you want to minister to stand before you that doesn't that doesn't regard the scripture with with all that wants to keep themselves that wants to keep themselves pure and holy and live a holy life for the people how could you uh accept something from somebody that's not living a Pure Life and try to teach teach you how to live a way that's pleasing to God if they're not holy so you know James taught us that the the metric that men look at one another is by works to see what you're doing and how you're how you're approaching God and of course the way God looks is Faith he wants to see your faith and a lot of times we can't see Faith but we can see whether we regard God's word whether we regard God's Sanctuary that the the the church whether we keep it in reverence when we come into the sanctuary if we're just going about uh shaking hands in the middle of the sanctuary and uh and doing things that are not becoming to keep it holy and and uh and and how we regard our own vessel and you know what Malachi chapter 3 verse one it talks about how that John the Baptist well it prophesies of John the Baptist coming uh you know Malachi doesn't say John the Baptist but it talks about that God would send his messenger before his face to prepare the way because the one that you seek and I'm paraphrasing a little bit the one that they had been looking for for 4 000 years will quickly come to his Temple so now John the Baptist had to come to prepare to make the way straight to get the people's mind ready to receive the word that was going to come to the temple quickly maybe unexpectedly and and uh you know they sat on the banks of the river and and John spoke and and turned began to turn their hearts and they they began to realize that something was happening something great was happening and and then all of a sudden uh Jesus came on the scene the word that he had been looking for for so many thousands of years and he walked into the temple and they should have had the temple purified and clean and everything just uh moving in perfect order with God's word just uh you know go back to the scriptures and see what uh you know what can I do to live a better life and how can I how should we do the order of this of the church service and how should we do the um you know is there anything that we're doing that's not right but instead they had the place filled with merches that were they were they had their eyes on the things of this world and they were selling uh selling dude money changers in the temple and when God came the word came to the temple now let's take it take a step back we we all should we were all been taught the type of the temple the type of the temple is is the Christian experience of is your you are the Tabernacle of the Lord and that the Christian experience is to go through the outer Court to the inner Court to the holy of holies we know all the types about how when you get into the inner core there's still clouds that cover over the Sun but when you move into the holy of holies then the the candlesticks and the the there's the pillar of fire back there that that shines light all the time even when you're at bad times or good times it doesn't matter now the Lord the word came to the tip to the temple and the temple was not holy it wasn't kept in a holy place and so he did the only thing it just something rose up in him and said this is not right because God has a plan and a purpose that is repeated All Through the Bible that the word will not come to an unclean vessel it's God to be holy it's got to be that you can't break that all through the scriptures that God will not bring his word and if you expect God to give you a revelation to open his word to you and you're not living in Holiness and keeping your life Sanctified and clean and have a desire to live more for God every day then uh it breaks the scripture for God's word to come to you and reveal himself to you and Step Into Your Vessel and so uh Jesus did really the only thing you know it baffles a lot of people when they read this how oh the loving God how can he get up a whip and and beat the money changes out but he did it because he desired Holiness because he was coming to the temple and he took up the Whip and drove the money changers out because he wants he wants us to be holy he won't get his Tabernacle to be holy that was just a type of our Tabernacle of us he wants to come and live in us but he can't do that unless we live unless we live in Holiness and I'm not talking about legalism not not legalism now because legalism is getting a book of rules and that's what the the in the Old Testament Israelites when Moses came down on the Ten Commandments he uh they they looked at those those Ten Commandments as as rules to follow instead of the attributes being made manifested attribute that same word that need to be made manifest in the people and and uh it's it's not legalism and uh you know all down through scripture people are are looking for the the true evidence of the Holy Ghost you can see this uh the um this great Planet how God moved through John Wesley that um you know John Wesley thought that if you shouted you got the Holy Ghost and and they you know they were looking for this promise and uh then it moved along a little bit further and they uh in Pentecost they thought the evidence was tongues and uh and it's so we look at Holiness and sanctification down through history Holiness has been looked at as the evidence of the new birth because it's it's confusing to our to our mental to our mental conception how you can live a holy life how can you live you can live where um you know the apostles were casting out spirits and they had power to cast out spirits and to live a holy life without in John 17 he says sanctify them by my by father and by my by by truth Thy word is truth so they were Sanctified potentially and uh but not they didn't they hadn't come to Pentecost yet and it it's uh you know what it's you've got to uh sanctification is not the baptism of the Holy Ghost and um you know I've been um I just been thinking about uh how you know when you're ministering you kind of tug people in One Direction or the other and I I've been thinking about how you know one one good example of that is when people preach on the fivefold ministry where you can go so far One Direction where you don't have a personal relationship with the Holy Ghost that you rely on so much on the ministry and then you can go the other direction and where you're not you're not you're not seeking help for the ministry you like live in isolationism where you're you're sitting at home and you're listening to taste in your life you're not going to church and so there's a the middle of the road to everything and I just want to clarify something now uh when I uh you might say well brother Bob uh you know you talk about love and and such and so forth but now brother Bob do you believe like how Jesus did that he will he wanted to sanctify his Temple well Bob do you believe that your home should be Sanctified do you believe your children should be in obedience do you believe in that there's a middle of the road see you can't you can't be a Hitler and say you're gonna you're gonna be a Christian but on the other hand I can't let my daughters wear pants and such life I can't let my children run around with long hair and and that kind of thing I want my home to be Sanctified because I want the spirit of the Lord to be made to feel welcome I can't let my children go up to the to their uh upstairs room and shut the door and get on the internet and let all kind of foul things come in I need to be aware of what's going on in my home because you know brother Brown preached the sermon doors and a door in your heart you have doors that if you shut you won't you want every door of your heart to be made open to the Holy Spirit you can come in and have total preemness and maybe we could apply that to our homes you know when when uh maybe search out your home and make sure that everything is perfectly and older so they're not just in your heart that the Holy Spirit can come in but in your home that the Holy Spirit can come in the house and be welcome in your home and you know a lot of times when I pray I I get on my knees at night and I put my hands on the wall and say God's sanctified sanctify every wall in this home because I don't want him to just I don't want to want to be one corner of my own one place that he's not welcome y'all forgive me and I believe in holiness but I don't believe in there's a a middle of the road to everything you you know our children Jesus told in Matthew about how uh despise not these little children because your little children there's an approach to that if you try to get your children to live a holy life and you yourself are not living only life then it'll wound them in their in their Spirit uh I remember that this is a table quote now about or I was looking for it I couldn't find I remember really Paul's testimony how he uh brother Brown told him don't spank your children and anger because it will wound it will it will wound their little angel and they uh in Matthew said uh their their angels are always beholding the father's face because you know until they come to a certain age they have a community insane if they were to die right then they'd go right into the presence of the Lord that their theophany and what about what about adults you know we we also are are wound enough if I was to call you you stupid for not having a revelation you know that would that would lose you in your spirit and you know then uh then I wouldn't be able to help you anymore because you kind of have that to overcome so there's there's a uh and you know I I actually that last sermon I preached is how do you get your children to uh to how do you how do you approach holding this in your home and encourage your children to live a holy lives and the answer is to catch a vision if you can get them to see their plan and purpose in life they're uh I was talking to somebody recently and um I'm sorry I'm kind of bouncing around a little bit because I just got a million thoughts at once but I I was talking to somebody recently and they said I'm I I can't teach my children because I'm not a minister now I I have to I have to say something about that now because you know even the even the the weakest if you've got the Holy Ghost the the weakest Christian is greater than John the Baptist so you've got surely you have something that you can teach surely you can you can uh uh just you know when we were my kids were little they uh I used to put pillows down and I I'd say you step on this pillow and that's justification and then I put two pillars down now what's the next step sanctification I make them tell me what it was you step on that first pillow sight justification what is that I believe that yeah and you step on that next pillow what is sanctification and I own up and you know maybe they didn't really have a true understanding but but you can teach them something teach them a little bit and maybe uh sometimes in church things things begin to get a little bit deep and you take them home and and and backtrack a little bit teach them a little simple things like like that God has that you have value to God and you know that's a that's a real simple thing that you can teach your children that and the devil will try to teach young people they don't have any value that God doesn't care anything about them teach the little children you know I'm talking on the recorder and two maybe not a lot of y'all already have kids growing up and everything but but the little I I'm I just stressing this morning Holiness because it's uh without holiness then how can the word come to the temple without Holiness right so I I wrote down just a few things about what what brother Brown said about Holiness a few words and one word that he wrote was separate because a real holy person will be you can look upon them and they have separated themselves from the things of the world like Abraham a lot you know God will if you give God the preeminist he'll begin to separate you if you give it over to him he'll separate you from the things of the world and you know the first thing when you when a new desire comes into your life a lot of the sisters is maybe more apparent but um you know you telling the sisters because they were they'll change their dress well what about the brothers the brothers you know a real man has baggy knees you can't change if I'm thinking on that a real man is not somebody that lifts weights and stuff but a real man is somebody you know we talk about at Valentine's Day how to impress your wife well I have never angered my wife when I said I'm going to my prayer quality my life has never got upset when I said I'm I'm going away to pray a little bit a praying man that wants to have his house holy and set in order that'll that'll please you watch we're at all too a real Holy Ghost filled woman that should be pleasing to her to have her man desire uh to to for his children to hear somebody crying out for God to save my children and save my family help my wife to be a better mother help help me to be a better parent and you know uh you know I when I first became a parent I I used to tell the Lord like I feel like Solomon I don't know how to go out or how to come in I don't know which way to go but he knows all things and if you ask the Lord how to raise your children how to do God will guide you in everything which job to get which church to go to how to raise your children which color to buy if you let him do the answering and seek his will now the next thing the next word that brother Brown talked about was an order because God puts your life in order everything when you when you are Sanctified in the holy God orders your life and and uh you know he he preached a series of sermons about conduct order and Doctrine because the Tabernacle of the Lord or the the church that you go to has an order and everything has to be set in order to be pleasing to God you don't come into church and uh you know eating stuff in the back of the church and and uh just shaking hands hithering young and and uh like many other churches today that don't have this Revelation that we do that because we know we know how to act we know how to behave and we should and uh you know you don't uh you you don't come in just laughing and then making a mockery of it because of we have we know what the order and the approach should be and another thing that Holiness is a Sanctified life does is it makes you free because Holiness that part in your journey of sanctification is when the unclean Spirit goes out when the unclean Spirit goes out you should be free you should be free and and happy and joyful we should be the happiest people in the world because God has made us holy and sanctified cleansed and washed your name goes on the book when you're sanctified power over unclean spirits now that unclean Spirit goes out now you have power to cast out those clean Spirits they began to minister when they uh got to that stage in the journey the apostles but now brother Brown said he clarified things now you a minister has no right to to open the word tear open that order like the eagle you know open up that word if he has doesn't have a personal experience with the with the pillar fire just like Moses did I'm just clarifying because you know and uh I was reading in um this sermon that brother round spoke about in 1963 I forget the title it was in September but it was just before the seals were open and um I don't know he's got a few more minutes but he he prayed his prayer that he said uh Lord I pray that uh and I'm paraphrasing I just have a few little things to scribble down that every Spirit of doubting every spirit of fear denominational claim every habit every sickness every disease that's among the people that they would be delivering because and he went on to say the Seven Seals are going to be a reveal are going to be open now the word that the seventh seals you know all down through brother Brown's Ministry he was Preparing People through through the first pull in the second pool to receive the opening of the word his message didn't really start until 1963 you say I believe the message but I don't know what he preached after 1963 you haven't even heard the message if you haven't listened to the tapes and and understand I have just a basic understanding of what he uh preached after 1963 don't really understand the message because the message is before 1963 were just preparing away getting our hearts in mind uh the second pool to to uh you know call us to a clean life where you stand in the prayer line and he calls out by discernment what you've done in your past what what uh things are hindering you to to get things holy and right and I believe that's what he was calling for in this sermon I apologize I can't remember the title but that every Spirit let's just go through these just one kind of think about one step at a time every Spirit of the doubt now think of this in the context of the seals are about to be open and he's trying to clear the way get all of that out of the way every Spirit of dialing maybe doubting that he's not a real Prophet that he doesn't have the word for the age every spirit of fear you know that's a big one that people are afraid afraid that uh you know though something bad will happen on the way to church afraid that they'll they'll lose their job afraid that um you know I I I'm I've been acquainted with people that just every time they turn around that they're just afraid of everything but you know perfect love casts without fear and we don't we should not don't be content to live in fear and that's what he's trying to get to the people what about denominational clean clinging to your old old ideas of the old uh old doctrines and things that little little uh denominationalisms like Lot's wife where she turned around and turned into a pillar of salt don't turn around and look back every habit now you know there are good atoms if you get up in the morning and pray everyone that's a good habit if you read your Bible every day that's a good habit but now you don't want to get in the happy world this might hurt some feelings I gotta have my coffee I can't function I got it when you start relying on things you start getting into the getting into things where uh you know those are bad happens get the uh and you know we could go on along about that how about every sickness every disease that's among the people every disease that's another thing that hangs people get hung up in their mind that God wants me to be sick so they can glorify himself now let it be glorified in my healing not in my sickness because everyone in the New Testament in the New Testament is written to everyone that came to Jesus was healed there's not one recorded case of anyone that came to Jesus and wasn't healed I'm not I'm not I'm not preaching that you know if you've got to say in your life and that kind of thing you're going to be healed we all know the the prescription for healing is uh God God heals Christians first you give your life to him and promise to serve him and then he'll heal him okay but uh not not I'm just kind of wrapping up in your eyes trying to find a good place but now sanctification is not legalism outward formalism observance or rituals pronunciation of duties or being able here's a good one being able a sanctification you sit in the church and uh and you could you you hear somebody say uh the word and uh you maybe you take notes and you can write back exactly what the minister said exactly what they said and you begin to build up in your mind that uh because I can repeat back that I have an understanding but remember brother was preaching that until the Seven Seals open you you're just presuming you're just saying you're just saying that's what somebody else says now now maybe in a sanctification you kind of get wrapped up in in uh in the uh I'll kind of finish on this but now just because you can repeat back and you can say I believe that there is a sanctification justification sanctification Bachelor Holy Ghost and I'm not trying to offend anybody or anything I just feel I feel so strongly about holy living but just because you can quote back and read quotes and and say uh say exactly what brother Dale said right just repeat back exactly what he said until it's you know you can you can repeat the scripture where it says unless you're born in the spirit you can't say that Jesus is the Christ and I can repeat that all day long one day I'm not presuming anymore because it's become a living reality to me and the scriptures that I've heard over and over through the years they become living living inside and be become manifested and that's what by the way he's talking about where they become these attributes become made manifest in faith virtue knowledge where you know that he's the same yesterday today and forever it was in February 1963. I can't remember the time February 15th 1963 that's weird that I can remember the date but not the time all right we'll finish there thank you
