[7:54] everyone and bless Lord Jesus the word
[7:57] that would come forth Lord Jesus
[7:59] Christ's name amen am amen let's remain
[8:03] standing as we take a few scriptures
[8:06] amen uh uh let's uh first of all let's
[8:11] look over to uh Revelations the first
[8:15] chapter and uh let's go over to the
[8:19] Revelations
[8:22] 1 and uh let's drop down to the 17th
[8:26] verse
[8:34] and when I saw saw him I fell at his
[8:38] feet as dead and he laid his right hand
[8:43] upon me saying unto me fear not I am the
[8:49] first and the last I am he that was that
[8:52] liveth and was dead and behold I am
[8:56] alive forever more
[9:01] the I mean I am alive forever more amen
[9:05] and have the keys of hell and of death
[9:09] right amen let's now go over to Romans
[9:13] the eth chapter and I want to speak a
[9:16] little bit I I I mentioned that the
[9:18] title was going to be
[9:21] Easter's quickening power amen and uh
[9:25] we're we're in the Easter season now and
[9:28] I know Romans 811 I know that we're in a
[9:31] day when the word of God is coming to
[9:36] pass in more ways than we can even see
[9:39] sometimes that's right but we can see
[9:41] that the scripture always holds true
[9:43] amen amen Romans
[9:45] 811 but if the spirit of him that raised
[9:49] up Jesus from the dead dwells in you he
[9:53] that raised up Christ from the dead
[9:56] shall also Quicken your mortal body
[10:02] by the spirit that dwelleth in you amen
[10:08] amen that quickening power amen the and
[10:12] if the spirit and we realize that the
[10:14] quickening power is the spirit of God
[10:17] that's right and that spirit of God that
[10:19] raised up that was in Jesus that raised
[10:21] him up from the dead that's let's jump
[10:24] over to Mark 16
[10:29] 1 and 2 Mark 16 1 and 2 now this is the
[10:35] scripture for Easter they usually use
[10:37] this scripture around the Easter time it
[10:39] says and when the Sabbath this is after
[10:42] the Lord had passed away and he was in
[10:44] the
[10:46] grave and when the Sabbath was passed
[10:50] Mary of Magdalene and Mary the mother of
[10:53] James and
[10:54] salomi the had brought sweet spices that
[10:59] they might come and anoint him and and
[11:04] very early in the
[11:06] morning the first day of the week they
[11:09] came unto the Seiler at the rising of
[11:13] the
[11:14] sun amen and uh I took a lot of this
[11:18] message from the message brother Brown
[11:20] talked about it is the rising of the sun
[11:23] right and you can be seated uh and I
[11:27] realize you know that
[11:30] the rising of the sun you know uh uh my
[11:34] my
[11:35] son-in-law uh got me a uh uh a little
[11:40] thing to that I he he he actually
[11:42] downloaded a little video on my
[11:45] iPod and I was I'm amazed with each time
[11:49] I see it cuz it's called Uh God of
[11:52] Wonders and in it they talk about the
[11:55] sun you know the sun we have that big
[11:57] Globe we have out there that puts out
[11:58] the Heat heat that we get here in
[12:00] Georgia seeming like a lot of humidity
[12:02] too that's right okay am uh and over
[12:05] there in New Mexico they just got a
[12:07] snowstorm yesterday so I don't
[12:09] understand it same sun over there same
[12:12] sun over here but they got a snowstorm
[12:13] over there well uh yesterday they were
[12:16] they were going through a snowstorm and
[12:18] and I said wow what do you mean a
[12:20] snowstorm look how nice it is here our
[12:23] grass is barely barely coming up in our
[12:26] yard I don't understand you guys I think
[12:29] you guys got the advantage here you know
[12:32] we'd love to cut grass like you cut
[12:34] grass all we get is thorns and thisel
[12:37] out there but nevertheless I I I was
[12:40] looking at the grass brother the kids
[12:42] were just rolling in the grass yesterday
[12:44] I mean uh when we were out at brother
[12:45] Dale's and I says my gosh I says we
[12:48] wouldn't dare try that at
[12:50] home right you'd get up with more thorns
[12:53] on you then you know what to do with we
[12:55] don't walk barefooted in our grass but
[12:58] uh it's so so happens that I guess the
[13:00] sun rises in the East and sets in the
[13:02] west we haven't gotten our spring yet
[13:05] we're expecting it soon yeah amen I saw
[13:09] the blossom starting on my peach tree
[13:11] they probably froze with the snow but uh
[13:14] nevertheless we're looking in looking at
[13:17] the rising of the sun I was telling you
[13:19] about this video called God of Wonders
[13:22] and they said that our son is one of the
[13:23] most smallest ones out there but yet it
[13:27] has so much power that they you know I
[13:30] work on nuclear bombs at the laboratory
[13:32] at Los naal laboratory and they go and
[13:36] they explain to us how many kilotons of
[13:40] TNT one of these hydrogen bombs can
[13:43] produce right I mean it's out of your
[13:45] mind it's it's unimaginable right you
[13:48] know what we seen what you see in the
[13:51] films of Hiroshima and Nagasaki those
[13:54] bombs are just the blasting cap that
[13:57] sets off the
[14:00] bomb and I was talking that I don't want
[14:03] to talk anything classified here I could
[14:04] get in trouble because it goes over the
[14:06] internet you know but
[14:09] nevertheless that little that nuclear
[14:13] bomb that we know of that was set off in
[14:15] Hiroshima nasaki is just the neutrons
[14:20] that set off the real
[14:23] explosion in other words it's the
[14:26] blasting cap that Timothy McBay had in
[14:29] that
[14:30] fertilizer you know so you can realize
[14:33] that you know there's much more power
[14:35] amen and then an interesting thing is is
[14:37] when you get that many neutrons hit in
[14:39] something even what's not nuclear
[14:42] doesn't have to be Atomic right we we
[14:45] set off nuclear right right that's why
[14:47] they were so afraid in the first atomic
[14:49] bomb that they're going to set off the
[14:50] atmosphere right exactly y because they
[14:53] put out that many neutrons things that
[14:55] aren't nuclear like salt goes nuclear
[14:59] right so you say well then how can how
[15:02] can that be and then we're they're
[15:03] talking about the Sun and they say the
[15:06] sun in 1 second's time puts out more
[15:09] energy than 5 million kilot my 5 million
[15:13] atomic bombs w i what in a second of
[15:18] that energy just it's rolling around in
[15:20] the way it's doing and it doesn't turn
[15:22] off yep amen it hasn't turned off in a
[15:26] long long the same son you look up at
[15:29] was the same son that was here when
[15:30] Jesus was here see so you realize that
[15:34] hey God put that in in in in his word
[15:38] and it's there because it can't it can't
[15:42] fail it it falls in its position every
[15:45] single day you know how much more should
[15:48] us as a bride be able to fall into
[15:50] position every single day amen so when
[15:53] we look at the quickening power of our
[15:55] Lord Jesus Christ and we we look at the
[15:58] at there in the in the in in uh when we
[16:01] start looking at at at Easter and what
[16:04] we're what this season is and we start
[16:07] to look at the at at at at at what we're
[16:09] trying to be quickening of our mortal
[16:12] bodies how are we ever going to arrive
[16:14] there yeah you know brother Brown said
[16:17] we don't have enough Faith to cure the
[16:19] common cold and how are we going to gain
[16:21] enough Faith to Quicken our mortal
[16:23] bodies and bring them up from the grave
[16:25] right amen some people say well it's not
[16:28] supposed to be in us it's supposed to be
[16:30] in the Saints of the last day well who
[16:31] do you think we are you know the Saints
[16:34] of the last day are going to call us all
[16:36] out of the great who do you think we are
[16:39] what time do you think we're living in
[16:41] you know we've got to come to a place
[16:43] where we'll take God as word just like
[16:45] the sun does every day that's right amen
[16:48] right but I was looking at uh Josiah in
[16:50] the in the car he has
[16:52] a a Bible and it's like a comic book and
[16:56] I just trying out my new glasses bought
[16:59] me some new glasses cuz I was pretty
[17:00] much blind over here without my reading
[17:02] glasses so she bought me some new
[17:04] glasses I picked up that book and I
[17:06] started reading Genesis and I was
[17:08] reading it
[17:09] said and Genesis Genesis 1 let me see
[17:13] where where am I Genesis 1 and 2 it says
[17:16] and the Earth was without form and void
[17:19] well of course that's comic book style
[17:20] so they kind of show the pictures but
[17:22] they're not really saying what the word
[17:24] is the word saying something and they
[17:25] show the picture saying something else
[17:27] for example you see
[17:30] some kind of weird fruit hanging off of
[17:32] a tree that uh Eve Eve was taken upon
[17:35] but we know what it was now so here you
[17:38] see you see he says in the beginning
[17:41] okay and the Earth was without form and
[17:43] void and darkness was upon the face of
[17:45] the deep and the waters and and the
[17:48] waters rolled over okay now this is my
[17:50] paraphrasing Waters were rolling over
[17:52] the Earth so on a spinning Earth out
[17:55] there that there was really no form and
[17:57] void and you start to look at it and you
[18:00] see that and the spirit of God moved
[18:03] upon the face of the waters even the sky
[18:07] the water in the sky and the water on
[18:08] the ground or the water in the oceans
[18:11] and the water over the ground was just
[18:13] everywhere it just didn't have a a place
[18:16] you can tell it apart right and God
[18:19] actually separated the waters from the
[18:21] waters but first of all he said let
[18:24] there be
[18:25] light yeah wait a minute there was no
[18:28] sun created yet but he said yet let
[18:31] there be light what kind of light was it
[18:33] that they were seeing there if you go
[18:35] back and you can imagine yourself right
[18:38] there at the dawn of time and you can
[18:40] you can imagine yourself standing there
[18:42] and the world was void and darkness was
[18:44] upon the face of the Earth and just the
[18:46] whirling Waters of waves the skies were
[18:49] full of waves the ground was full of
[18:51] waves the air was full of waves and the
[18:53] Lord moved over the the the the the Deep
[18:57] yeah scripture says
[18:59] no form
[19:01] void and he said let there be light
[19:04] right there was no sunlight yet God
[19:06] hadn't created the sun yet but he said
[19:08] let there be light that's right so what
[19:10] kind of light was it amen it wasn't this
[19:13] light and it wasn't it wasn't any light
[19:15] we know of but it is the light we know
[19:17] of because it's the same light we see in
[19:19] the in the picture of the pillar of fire
[19:22] was over brother brandom so there was
[19:24] light then God you think about the seeds
[19:27] that were down in the Earth God said
[19:29] there was seeds in the earth and they
[19:31] needed light okay so and God made this
[19:35] light but yet it wasn't the sunlight
[19:38] yeah and then he said and and the seeds
[19:40] were in the earth he says and then and
[19:43] then you you go over to Genesis 3 and I
[19:46] mean 1 and 3 it says and let the light
[19:50] and and and let there be light in
[19:53] he okay and he separated the waters
[19:56] after that then he moves over and he
[19:59] brings plant life on the Earth right
[20:02] okay then on Genesis 1:14 he he he he
[20:07] put lights in the sky and made
[20:11] Seasons all right you say well that was
[20:13] all when the sun came out and and it
[20:16] would go far away from the earth or come
[20:17] close to the Earth remember
[20:20] remember true science proves God is true
[20:24] that's right true science sure so you
[20:27] start to look at it here here it is here
[20:29] here you got God on on Genesis 1:14 he
[20:32] made the seasons with that Supernatural
[20:35] light and then he made Genesis 1:15 he
[20:39] made the Sun and he made the Lesser he
[20:42] made the the the lights in the heavens
[20:45] right okay then in Genesis 1:16 he
[20:49] actually made the sun and the moon so he
[20:51] made lights in the sky then he made the
[20:53] Suns and the moon and then he made the
[20:56] Stars yeah or he made the Stars also y
[20:59] yeah so you start to say well how could
[21:01] this all be he made the plant life and
[21:04] he made the plant life to sprout way
[21:06] before there was sunl mhm well that's
[21:09] not in my botney uh frame of mind but I
[21:12] do
[21:13] realize that there's more light than the
[21:16] physical light that the sun provides or
[21:18] the moons or the star
[21:20] provides the light the light that I'm
[21:23] looking at is the light of God's word
[21:25] amen and what it produces right
[21:29] so what what are we looking at we're
[21:31] still looking want to keep our mind on
[21:33] on on on this this resurrection power of
[21:37] E of of that the Lord brought forth in
[21:40] his resurrection so
[21:43] then so then so then we realize that the
[21:46] light of the sun wasn't the light that
[21:48] first came upon the Earth that's right
[21:50] and the light of the Stars wasn't the
[21:52] first light to come upon the Earth right
[21:54] and the light that actually brought the
[21:55] seed out of its position Glory
[21:59] wasn't actually the
[22:01] sunlight right it was God's light Glory
[22:05] now we start to look at you know when we
[22:08] look at at at
[22:10] at at when the Lord ignited the Sun out
[22:14] there when he uhhh set the sun in in in
[22:17] orbit and brought the earth into that
[22:19] Lifeline you know uh science is saying
[22:22] you know
[22:23] what the Earth is running in the out get
[22:27] getting close to the to the the inner
[22:29] bands they they can calculate by its
[22:32] orbits and everything how many years it
[22:34] will take before the Earth actually gets
[22:36] pulled into the sun yeah how many years
[22:39] right millions and millions of years I
[22:40] don't know how they calculate it but
[22:41] they figure it out you know they're so
[22:44] science is so so careful that they can
[22:47] send a rocket out of here or should I
[22:50] say a rocket up launch a satellite send
[22:54] it circles around the Sun several times
[22:58] and calculated to come right into the
[23:00] atmosphere of one of the planets out
[23:02] there they got one spinning around
[23:03] Saturn right now trying to look for a
[23:05] certain Moon and this I I actually
[23:08] worked on that one uh uh the cuz I was
[23:11] building the uh the generators the
[23:14] generators the reactor generators made
[23:16] with atomic or should I say U nuclear
[23:19] stuff that would keep the the the thing
[23:21] warm way away from the presence of the
[23:23] Sun so they had they had little heat
[23:26] sources in all the in all the m parts of
[23:29] all that of that satellite and they had
[23:32] to be producing their own power so they
[23:35] they made generators on the actual
[23:37] satellite it's not very big I mean
[23:40] little little thing it up folds as it
[23:42] comes out of there but
[23:44] nevertheless uh uh I had I had a lot of
[23:47] a lot of work on that on that satellite
[23:50] but they got it all the way to Saturn
[23:53] and set it around one of the moons up
[23:55] there and they actually did what from
[23:58] here they control that thing with radio
[24:00] waves or something they control that
[24:02] thing until it finally finally it's
[24:06] still doing its work up there it hasn't
[24:08] gone dead yet right they called that one
[24:11] uh what was the name of you can look it
[24:12] up on the internet uh
[24:16] um can't remember the name
[24:21] um look up Saturn oh There He Man work
[24:25] is work I don't like work okay next
[24:29] so all right so what happens is
[24:33] nevertheless they calculate how how long
[24:36] these things will happen y so by looking
[24:38] at the orbit of the of the Earth around
[24:40] the Sun they calculate that one day the
[24:42] Earth is going to be pulled into the sun
[24:44] yeah so
[24:45] already most that's why money is being
[24:49] appropriated to try and explore Mars you
[24:53] say why Mars because it's the next one
[24:55] outside of the Life Band yeah see as the
[24:57] earth goes in to the inside Life Band
[25:00] global warming they say then the next
[25:03] one coming in is going to be Saturn into
[25:05] a life band that can keep life like we
[25:08] got here so that's why they're trying to
[25:10] put so much money into exploring Mars
[25:13] because it'll be on the outer skirts of
[25:16] our of of the Earth's life band uh
[25:19] around the Sun so what happens we look
[25:22] at Easter
[25:24] morning uh there and when we're starting
[25:27] to look at Easter morning in Mark 16 we
[25:30] see the sun was Rising this same Sun
[25:33] that we see in the morning rising over
[25:35] but there was the rising of another son
[25:38] the S Jesus the sun and the S and at the
[25:43] rising of the Sun in that day there was
[25:45] another seal broken and we talk about
[25:48] the Easter seal right see the Romans had
[25:51] placed a seal over the grave y should I
[25:54] say the soldiers from the temple who
[25:57] were Roman guards
[25:59] set a seal over the grave and said
[26:02] nobody they said this this fake this
[26:06] this person here said he was going to
[26:08] raise from the dead he's not going to
[26:10] raise from the dead without breaking
[26:11] this Roman seal and they put a seal over
[26:14] the grave right they made sure that
[26:16] nobody can go can enter that grave
[26:19] without passing the guard without
[26:20] getting in Breaking the Roman seal right
[26:24] and they didn't realize that that one
[26:25] was going to be broken from within right
[26:28] so what happened so here was the
[26:30] breaking of a seal we talk about the
[26:32] Easter seal and we we realize that that
[26:37] that the breaking of a seal contains a
[26:40] lot of power we look at at at at at at
[26:44] that breaking of the seal at that time
[26:46] when God decided to break the seal of
[26:49] the Grave you know the grave has such a
[26:51] seal that all through time nobody's come
[26:55] up from there right right nobody gets
[26:59] out of the Grave come on they go there
[27:01] but they don't come back out come
[27:04] on but the Easter seal proved something
[27:07] different right amen it proved that
[27:09] there was life that God had life he was
[27:12] a possessor of life and he had given
[27:14] already his word that he was going to be
[27:17] quickened from the grave the the way
[27:19] that because David had already said of
[27:21] him that he would Quicken from the grave
[27:23] right that he I suffer not my Holy One
[27:26] to see corruption and and so by by David
[27:30] saying that under inspiration it was
[27:32] Christ speaking through David that he
[27:35] was not going to stay in the
[27:37] grave so when we see the breaking of the
[27:40] Easter seal we see that he broke he
[27:43] broke the Seal of death hell in the
[27:46] grave and he came forth to bring newness
[27:50] of life just like that son if you look
[27:53] at that son that that that morning in
[27:56] the in the dawn of time yeah
[27:58] when it when when when God said let
[28:01] there be light and that little plant
[28:03] down in the depths of the water like
[28:05] brother BR talks about the about the uh
[28:08] Easter lily right in the mck and the
[28:10] Meer not even able to see any light but
[28:14] when spring comes around and it feels
[28:16] that there's light up there it can't see
[28:18] it but it just feels that there's light
[28:20] out there it starts pushing its way
[28:22] through the mck and the m and to get out
[28:24] to the light right just like our sinful
[28:27] Souls we're in the depths of the world
[28:30] where we have no way to look up we're in
[28:32] the in the depths of sin and drugs and
[28:34] alcohol and and everything that the
[28:36] world's got to offer us and we have no
[28:38] idea where we're from or what we're what
[28:41] our purpose is in life something inside
[28:44] of us says there's something real about
[28:48] this there's something real about God
[28:51] there's something true about God and I
[28:53] want that I'm hungry for that something
[28:57] I I can't help it right you might have
[29:00] run through different Avenues you might
[29:02] seek in different ways but someplace
[29:05] along the line you say I need God I need
[29:08] he I need his life I need I need the
[29:11] truth of God's
[29:13] word and somehow
[29:16] somewhere God makes himself obligated to
[29:19] make sure the light crosses your path
[29:22] amen amen he he finds a way to let that
[29:26] light come across your path to draw you
[29:29] from the depths of sin now what
[29:33] happens when we startop when we look at
[29:35] it we look at the at the at at at at the
[29:40] the days that that that the that life
[29:43] was was was was in turmoil yeah in the
[29:49] darkness of of of sin yes sir and
[29:52] almighty
[29:54] God was able to
[29:58] beat that seal now we start looking at
[30:03] seals when we when we look at seals cuz
[30:05] I'm talking about everything that we
[30:07] know brother Brown preached about Easter
[30:09] yeah he preached the Easter seal yeah he
[30:12] preached the uh he preached the uh uh
[30:16] uh it is the rising of the Sun and we
[30:20] look at the Easter seal you know the
[30:22] Easter seal you know he talked about
[30:24] tuberculosis yeah yeah now uh my dad
[30:29] worked in a in uh uh in Von MOA in the
[30:33] Las Vegas area it was a sanitarium for
[30:36] tuberculosis patients hundreds and
[30:39] hundreds of people from all over the
[30:41] nation were there the doctor would take
[30:44] them and sunbathe them in a healthy
[30:46] environment they brought food to them
[30:49] they brought all kinds of things to try
[30:51] and give them the the uh resistance to
[30:54] the disease as best they could but to
[30:57] bir osis was such a strong disease they
[31:00] were dying one after another after
[31:02] another Y and they put out the to get
[31:06] finances for all these sanitariums
[31:08] around the nation they put out the thing
[31:10] called the Easter seal and they sell
[31:13] little little uh postage stamps for
[31:15] everybody to Buy Buy for so much money
[31:19] and you bring these little Easter Seals
[31:21] and you stick them on your letters or
[31:23] right over the the sealed part of your
[31:24] letter you stick these little Easter
[31:26] Seals you'd buy them and they'd send the
[31:28] money to the catarium to help out TB all
[31:31] over the nation right and they would
[31:33] stick these little stamps on your and
[31:35] everybody would break the seal when
[31:37] they're going to open their
[31:39] letters but the real seal they're
[31:41] wanting to break was the way to figure
[31:44] out how to heal that dreaded disease
[31:48] tuberculosis and they looked and looked
[31:50] everywhere to try and figure that
[31:53] out well their brother Brown said they
[31:56] came a public outcry y a public outcry
[32:00] to cry out for God to give the
[32:03] revelation of the seal to reveal to the
[32:07] doctors how to heal tuberculosis right
[32:10] amen and it went out and they prayed and
[32:12] they prayed and they prayed and People
[32:14] Prayed and all of a sudden somebody came
[32:17] up with something called
[32:19] antibiotics y right antibiotics and they
[32:22] started finding out they were they were
[32:24] shooting shooting these people with
[32:26] radiation it was working but not that
[32:28] great yeah right they were doing uh
[32:31] things like uh like like of course
[32:34] giving them uh trying to build up their
[32:36] immune system of course you see all
[32:38] these people with AIDS trying to build
[32:40] up their immune system eat healthy don't
[32:43] don't eat nothing you know but it didn't
[32:45] it wasn't working right they were still
[32:50] dying it was such a dread of disease
[32:52] that they had to be in a sanitarium way
[32:54] away from the public because anybody
[32:56] that came in contact with could catch
[32:58] tuberculosis yeah so they they couldn't
[33:01] figure out how to break that seal the
[33:03] doctors so people went to
[33:06] praying and antibiotics came on the
[33:08] scene right well they didn't only heal
[33:11] tuberculosis my dad lost his job because
[33:15] no more sick people but he was amazed
[33:18] cuz he thought the doctor was doing it
[33:20] he actually told me the story he says Dr
[33:23] gallentine the one who was working he
[33:25] said healed all those people oh my but
[33:30] he didn't know that they had brought
[33:31] antibiotics in and started giving it to
[33:33] all these people but he really thought
[33:35] that what he was doing did it but no
[33:37] they they came in with antibiotics they
[33:39] healed it right and let me tell you all
[33:42] those soldiers in World War I that lost
[33:44] limbs because of a little because of
[33:46] infection of of of of just stepping on a
[33:49] on a on a on a landmine they could they
[33:53] lost limbs and legs and all these things
[33:55] because infection would in so bad that
[33:59] they had to amputate they would amputate
[34:01] all the soldiers limbs that got Dam got
[34:03] a little damage right and you say why
[34:07] because they had no antibiotics at the
[34:08] time right but when antibiotics came up
[34:12] it was developed for TB but it was
[34:14] healing a lot of other
[34:16] things now we still go to the doctor get
[34:19] antibiotics for the different things
[34:21] whenever we catch an infection but what
[34:24] happens people pray and ask God right
[34:28] they got a hold of God for it so they
[34:30] broke the seal and understood the the
[34:32] the details about these
[34:35] sicknesses and they they realized there
[34:38] that that there was a there was there
[34:39] was
[34:41] healing in what God has placed in order
[34:44] right man now watch so what happened the
[34:48] seal in Jeremiah there was a seal and
[34:53] the seal in Jeremiah the scripture says
[34:55] that he was in in prison for pre ing
[34:58] against uh the country right and he was
[35:01] in jail cuz he said that Babylon was
[35:03] going to take this country and take them
[35:05] out to be uh uh 70 years out there and
[35:09] they put him in jail but an uncle of his
[35:12] come over and says Jeremiah you know
[35:14] you're the next kin here and I have this
[35:17] piece of land he says buy the land from
[35:20] me cuz I can't hold it and I I want I
[35:23] want to sell it to you Jeremiah says why
[35:27] would I buy buy land that's going to go
[35:30] into captivity and become just worth
[35:33] nothing and God said buy the
[35:36] land why would I want to buy land that's
[35:38] going to go that's going to just be bar
[35:40] uh what do they call that uh desolate
[35:43] land when everybody goes to captivity
[35:46] right and God said buy the
[35:49] land have them have do the
[35:53] paperwork so Jeremiah bought the land
[35:55] from his uncle they in in the prison mhm
[35:59] he had them they they took and they put
[36:01] a seal the government seal for the land
[36:05] they put the seal on it and did the
[36:07] documentation and everything that he got
[36:09] the title deed it was all sealed up and
[36:11] just for
[36:12] proper and then he took it and he put it
[36:15] in an earn
[36:17] vessel God told him save it well cuz one
[36:21] day it'll be worth something save it
[36:24] well so he put in an earn vessel they
[36:26] put another seal on it
[36:28] yep then they saved it in a well in a
[36:32] good place so that it would come up when
[36:34] they came back from Babylon 70 years had
[36:38] to be good for 70
[36:40] years sounds like some of us maybe we
[36:43] might have something of importance we
[36:45] might want to put in a safety deposit
[36:47] box you know some place right but you
[36:50] know with our banks falling apart where
[36:51] our safety deposit box being good you
[36:54] know but you know
[36:56] what from the dawn of
[36:59] time when Adam
[37:02] fell and
[37:04] Mankind lost its inheritance to be with
[37:07] God right and Eve fell from the presence
[37:11] of God and Adam knowing what he was
[37:14] going to do went and became evees Jesus
[37:18] Christ yeah right and he stood in the
[37:20] Gap and said you know what I'm going to
[37:23] save your
[37:25] life you know you you say well he he he
[37:29] just partook no he didn't just partook
[37:31] he knowingly partook yeah right he
[37:34] knowingly partook that it was going to
[37:36] it was going to cost him his life amen
[37:39] sure and he stood in the gap for Eve cuz
[37:42] he loved Eve glory and when he stood in
[37:44] the gap for Eve there was a
[37:47] reason that he let his
[37:51] seed mingle with the Serpent's Seed you
[37:54] say why because there was a
[37:58] time that this seed would have a
[38:01] redeemer yeah and that Redeemer would
[38:03] call all Adam's race back into
[38:09] position that's what the Easter Seal's
[38:12] about when when God said he when when
[38:15] God said you know she's bone of my bone
[38:17] and Flesh of My
[38:18] Flesh you know she he reached
[38:21] out to keep his wife from being Anni
[38:27] ated
[38:28] yeah so he he he he
[38:33] broke the seal yeah you say the seal the
[38:37] Seal of death there was no death in the
[38:39] land he was willing to take
[38:43] death so both
[38:45] ways you know there could be so
[38:51] Jeremiah looking at that you say well
[38:54] there's something better down the line
[38:57] yeah there's a reason yeah that God
[39:00] looks down the line when he looked down
[39:03] at this Earth while it was rolling in
[39:06] void he looked and he cared about those
[39:09] seeds sure and when he looked in his
[39:13] heart and he looked at God's
[39:15] predestinated seed that he had in his
[39:19] mind they were still sealed up in his
[39:22] mind there's something wonderful about
[39:24] the breaking of a seal Glory right
[39:28] there's something wonderful about the
[39:29] breaking of a seal right when you start
[39:32] to look at what how how God would
[39:35] save the good things for later amen say
[39:40] the good things for later yep you my mom
[39:42] used to
[39:44] camp and years ago she C some
[39:48] peaches she's long
[39:51] gone and the other day I looked in my
[39:53] closet and I still had a can of peach a
[39:55] bottle of peaches
[39:57] a ball jar yeah with sealed
[40:00] Peaches I think it was from my peach
[40:03] tree from years ago that she C and I
[40:07] took them out and I opened them up I
[40:09] said they're very
[40:11] old I said they're probably
[40:13] bad the color was good the smell was
[40:18] good they were good I hate
[40:23] them you know what you know what it's
[40:26] it's amazing how a seal can preserve
[40:31] exactly how a seal how a seal done
[40:34] properly I tried sealing a few things
[40:36] and I couldn't make it work but my but
[40:39] she had the art of how making now God
[40:43] has sealed up something for us right
[40:46] great things for us that have been
[40:48] hidden throughout all the ages right
[40:51] right you know in his mind he had an
[40:54] idea of what he wanted this bride to be
[40:58] he had an idea of how he could present
[41:01] to his bride his own character amen his
[41:04] own his own will his own abilities he
[41:07] wanted to to to to save something
[41:10] throughout time 2,000 years he wanted to
[41:14] say look the life that I live I want you
[41:17] to live amen the faith that I have I
[41:21] want you to have the the abilities that
[41:24] I have I want you to have yes amen how
[41:27] am I going to do this how am I going to
[41:29] get a people that will be of Faith
[41:32] people that will believe my word and
[41:34] take it as it is how am I going to have
[41:37] a people that look at my word and say
[41:41] you know what this promise that's
[41:44] written here in the word of God is my
[41:47] possession it's something that I I I
[41:49] don't deserve I don't I don't but I
[41:53] believe it's true and I'm going to
[41:55] possess it when you stand back and you
[41:57] say well what am I promised here what's
[42:00] in this for me how can I be an
[42:04] air to these kind of things right it's
[42:09] because he preserved it for you right
[42:12] through the ages he preserved it for you
[42:16] there's people that have died to make
[42:18] sure this gospel came out in English so
[42:21] that you can read it amen many people
[42:24] died to give this gospel to you burned
[42:27] at the stake for this right take a look
[42:30] at history John HW and all those people
[42:33] that died to give you this get this
[42:35] scripture where you can read it that's
[42:37] right amen
[42:39] right look at the mar book of Martyrs
[42:42] find out why they were getting killed in
[42:45] the book of Martyrs they were getting
[42:46] killed because they protested right and
[42:48] stood back and says the word of God
[42:50] should be something for the people why
[42:54] should the priest just give us what they
[42:55] want to give us right glor
[42:59] amen but it was
[43:02] preserved Through the Ages so that you
[43:05] can paric of it at this time right man
[43:08] like that bottle of peaches my mom left
[43:11] for me that's right the other day I
[43:13] founds a bottle of Choke Cherry syrup
[43:14] too yeah that was very good yeah amen
[43:18] you know I've got a you know and and and
[43:21] yet you start to look at how is it that
[43:25] that that that that he could preserve
[43:27] his own life Through the Ages and say
[43:31] okay we do understand that Pentecost we
[43:35] can go back to the book of Acts and we
[43:37] can see what Pentecost produced It
[43:40] produced a book of Acts and when we see
[43:42] that Pentecost produced The Book of
[43:45] Acts through the church ages through the
[43:49] Dark Ages how could God
[43:52] preserve a people that would come to the
[43:56] place and position that they'll say hey
[44:00] this is mine y it's my possession
[44:04] right wife says oh those peaches are too
[44:06] old you better throw them out they
[44:07] they're they're they're too old you
[44:09] don't she's been gone this many years I
[44:11] says yeah I says I understand that but I
[44:14] still they smell good they look
[44:18] good y you know what they didn't hurt me
[44:22] at
[44:23] all you know and now the same kind of
[44:26] thing
[44:27] how can they you say I'm a possessor of
[44:31] all that Pentecost has to
[44:34] offer silver and gold I don't have but
[44:38] such as I have right I'll give to you
[44:42] glory in the name of Jesus Christ rise
[44:44] up and walk and the scripture says his
[44:47] body received strength right and he got
[44:50] up and walked am how do you get to that
[44:55] place well you know what what's what's
[44:58] the the the use of a first fruits yeah
[45:01] right what is a what does a first fruits

[56:01] burnt motor oil on top of that seed and
[56:03] expect it to grow you'll kill the seed
[56:07] you can't put salt water on top of that
[56:10] seed and expect it to grow it'll kill it
[56:13] right but if you're watered by the water
[56:16] of the word if you're studying and
[56:19] believing what the word of God says
[56:21] about you if you're looking into the
[56:23] message of this hour and you're taking

[57:43] right your coils you don't have a coil
[57:45] you can't expect the Dynamics exactly
[57:49] but you know
[57:50] what this one here is Pentecost it's
[57:55] Jesus Christ bringing to pass all that
[57:59] this message has said would come to pass
[58:02] in The Bride of the last days right
[58:05] she's not going the scripture says she's
[58:07] not going to roll over right like that
[58:10] first church age because she was under
[58:13] the
[58:13] oage she's getting ready for a Rapture
[58:16] right she's not that same bride she is
[58:19] that same bride in faith right but she's
[58:22] the she's a bride that has come to a
[58:24] higher Revelation am a bigger truth
[58:27] because God has decided in this 20th
[58:30] century to reveal to us himself in the
[58:33] fullness of his word
[58:36] right you know you look at Jesus when
[58:41] Jesus looks at us he said she's bone of
[58:44] my bone and Flesh of My Flesh just like
[58:48] Adam said he's bone of my B she's bone
[58:50] of my bone and Flesh of My Flesh right
[58:52] you know when he looked at us through
[58:55] time when he thought about us in his
[58:58] mind he was thinking of a bride that
[59:01] would take him at his word right you
[59:04] know Joseph pointed out something to me
[59:08] he said you know if
[59:10] you keep saying I'm no good I I can't
[59:13] make it I'm not I wonder if I'm even a
[59:16] Christian yeah if you're professing
[59:18] things like that yeah if you you know
[59:22] God you take God at his word right right
[59:24] amen if you take him at his word don't
[59:27] you think he'll take you at your word if
[59:30] you start saying I'm not so sure I'm a
[59:32] Christian oh I don't know if I have
[59:35] faith or not I can't I maybe maybe I got
[59:38] to go to the you know if you don't take
[59:40] him at his word right if you don't if
[59:43] you don't if you profess things that are
[59:46] not as a
[59:48] Christian then he'll take you at your
[59:50] word right amen you're hurting
[59:53] yourself take him at his word right cuz
[59:56] he's he you can take him at his word
[59:59] he'll take you at your word so when you
[1:00:02] when you when you're under trial you
[1:00:04] come up and say look I'm a Son of God
[1:00:07] right I have a right to I have a right
[1:00:10] to be redeemed I have a right to my
[1:00:12] healing I have a right to everything I
[1:00:14] have a right to tell nature nature you
[1:00:18] back off
[1:00:20] right my pains aches and and hurts and
[1:00:24] pains that I go through you could tell
[1:00:26] turn to your pain and say pain you back
[1:00:28] off right I'm a Son of God and I believe
[1:00:32] God's word and I have a right to my
[1:00:34] healing my S my my healing is given to
[1:00:37] me cuz he paid for it at Calvary it's
[1:00:40] it's a finished work that's
[1:00:43] right realize I want to talk a little
[1:00:46] bit about raising uh resurrection power
[1:00:49] in the in Patriarchs of the days of old
[1:00:53] yeah you know the resurrecting power
[1:00:57] it's all through the scripture right
[1:00:59] Moses died the Angels carried him
[1:01:03] away and 800 years later at Mount
[1:01:07] Transfiguration he was standing there he
[1:01:10] said well you're not going to get to go
[1:01:11] into the promis he got to go into the
[1:01:13] promised land yeah you know there's no
[1:01:16] doubt he was there in Mount
[1:01:19] Transfiguration and he was talking to
[1:01:21] the Lord Jesus with
[1:01:22] Elijah you take a look at at at at where

[1:16:09] it the
[1:16:12] faith faith is a
[1:16:15] revelation that's
[1:16:17] right I asked a question one time what's
[1:16:20] the difference in a revelation of
[1:16:23] something or the reality of it what
[1:16:26] you're asking
[1:16:28] for the only difference is that your
[1:16:30] eyesight can see a reality right but
[1:16:33] your spiritual
[1:16:36] eye y your spiritual
[1:16:39] eye by faith can see it before it
[1:16:41] becomes a reality let dra down the
[1:16:46] Revelation like our brother said the sun
[1:16:48] came on
[1:16:51] later you know what the boty life could
[1:16:54] reduc but what I was thinking about
[1:16:56] while he was saying that I thought
[1:16:58] Lord you know in the Sun as it comes
[1:17:01] forth and we plant our garden it's going
[1:17:04] to take months and you know time for it
[1:17:07] to grow and
[1:17:10] produce but you know in that light that
[1:17:13] was there in
[1:17:17] creation what the seed it just started
[1:17:21] just come right out of the ground
[1:17:25] you didn't have to wait months weeks
[1:17:27] years or
[1:17:28] whatever it just come right out of the
[1:17:32] ground beautiful world
