[0:02] now just for a moment let's review the
[0:03] first seal the first seal I got it
[0:05] written right here cuz we're going to
[0:06] take the characteristics of each
[0:08] seal and then we're going to see how
[0:10] they all tie
[0:11] together cuz listen we can't get away
[0:14] whatever the seals reveal whatever great
[0:17] mystery that the seals
[0:19] reveal it is no more than the foundation
[0:22] of
[0:23] justification baptism of the Holy Ghost
[0:26] you can't get away from that why would a
[0:28] prophet go to the Future home which is
[0:31] after the seals broke preach us preach
[0:33] that that message was in eternity
[0:36] because it all was in the future home
[0:37] and that's all in eternity it wasn't the
[0:39] Millennium it was the future home that's
[0:42] eternity the Millennium is not Eternity
[0:44] for the world and some of the people now
[0:47] it is for us but we're backing it way
[0:50] back up here and we're Eternal right
[0:53] now I'm telling you we got to know
[0:55] something that's going on that the world
[0:58] knows nothing about that they're they're
[1:01] all looking for a Superman or a super
[1:03] race let's
[1:04] he God in human flesh again what in the
[1:08] world do you want more than that right
[1:10] it's just the world can't see it because
[1:12] we're common people and we just like I
[1:14] told you Jesus was so common they called
[1:17] him a wine biver bbub a glutton he was
[1:21] always eating with Sinners and
[1:22] prostitutes and you know I mean but that
[1:26] was God Almighty in human
[1:28] flesh uh they they watched him get a
[1:31] little angry one day and really said oh
[1:34] well he's nothing he's son of Joseph
[1:36] that's Joseph's boy look at him he's
[1:39] acting like a human well he was so much
[1:42] human till uh he hid himself but he was
[1:45] all of God he wasn't just so much God he
[1:48] was God yes so that's the way that's
[1:51] what I was we were talking about the
[1:52] Bible study and I said you know last
[1:54] Sunday I think we're all looking for
[1:56] sinless Perfection we're not going to
[1:58] get sinless Perfection like people think
[2:00] we're going to
[2:01] get I don't think so I I just don't see
[2:04] it I don't I didn't see it in Jesus look
[2:06] he got worse as far as in his body form
[2:09] he got worse heading toward Calvary
[2:12] people rejected him they threw things at
[2:14] him they they drove him out of here they
[2:16] in other words he was rejected more at
[2:18] the end of his message look at brother
[2:20] bham same identical way I know some of
[2:23] you weren't around but the first sermon
[2:25] I preached was was about um brother Bram
[2:29] and Jesus thear between them in November
[2:32] of
[2:33] 19 98 I believe it
[2:36] was everybody thought I was talking
[2:38] about brother Brandon but I was talking
[2:39] about Jesus I brought him all through
[2:41] his life and never said a word about who
[2:42] it was about a light came at his birth
[2:44] and all this and coming down through
[2:46] there well what came in Jesus's birth a
[2:49] life I mean everybody was thinking you
[2:52] know well he's he's talking about
[2:53] brother Brown's life and all I talking
[2:54] about the life of Jesus they were so
[2:56] together
[2:57] though that uh most of us I say most of
[3:01] us were born and there wasn't a light
[3:04] the only light we saw was the light
[3:06] above the you know in the room we didn't
[3:09] see a supernatural light you understand
[3:11] what I
[3:12] mean because that wasn't our calling but
[3:15] if we had been able to see in the other
[3:17] dimension you'd be able to see a light
[3:19] because you know what brother Brown told
[3:21] us he said you were given an angel at
[3:23] Birth what is an Angel that's your
[3:25] that's light I mean you're giv an angel
[3:27] at Birth to to keep you through uh
[3:30] through all the perils and things of
[3:31] Life why are we still
[3:33] here because the grace of God we have a
[3:36] if you're still alive and remain then
[3:38] you can put yourself in that scripture
[3:40] we which are alive and remain right
[3:43] okay and if we do happen to go on then
[3:46] we're the ones that's that's waiting for
[3:48] the ones that are alive and remain so
[3:51] you know we're all connected
[3:53] together but I truly believe that we're
[3:56] looking at a I don't think we
[4:00] see spiritual enough because it's like
[4:03] all this come up with with Hillary and
[4:06] and uh and Trump I knew she wasn't going
[4:09] to win I told a lot of y'all she's not
[4:11] going to win right I told you she wasn't
[4:13] going to win I told you why cuz she's
[4:16] weak nobody would have got behind her
[4:18] but you watch and see somebody's got a B
[4:21] cuz look you see that word now that does
[4:22] not the Beast there but there's got to
[4:24] there's a beast system in Revelations
[4:28] 13 and they have to have someone to
[4:31] speak for that Beast right and brother
[4:35] brandham clearly said Revelations 13 was
[4:37] the United States of America well we're
[4:40] so weak militarily now and economically
[4:42] till the world just laughs at us yeah we
[4:44] got to have somebody that's going to
[4:45] build it up what the first thing Trump
[4:47] said he said I'm going to add 500,000
[4:49] troops okay where they going they're
[4:51] going over there you know where they're
[4:52] going they're going to Syria they're
[4:53] going right over there where Russ is at
[4:55] you see how all this is coming
[4:57] together I don't believe that that
[4:59] Clinton would have done that but
[5:01] obviously not cuz he's the one that's
[5:02] going to call the shots for the next
[5:03] four years anyway
[5:05] so uh the woman's already been in the
[5:07] White House you know look outside please
[5:09] people just look outside right women
[5:11] rule this country yes they do women
[5:14] rules this country everything is a woman
[5:19] um look at the men they're beginning to
[5:21] act like women yeah
[5:24] yeah that's
[5:26] true I told y'all before I said look the
[5:28] Bible says in that in in what is it Luke
[5:33] 17:30 as it was in Sodom and Gomorrah so
[5:35] shall it be in the coming of the son of
[5:37] man we never had sure we had a lot of
[5:40] sodomy and all that stuff going on
[5:41] before but now it's legal that's why
[5:44] people went to Sodom and gomor that's
[5:46] right it's because it was legalized in
[5:48] Sodom and Gomorrah that's why they all
[5:50] went there it hasn't been legal in the
[5:52] United States until the stinking people
[5:55] did it you know the Supreme Court did it
[5:57] and said it was legal yeah
[6:00] okay so now it's word modern modern
[6:02] Sodom and gomorra right now the
[6:04] revelation of the son of man can come
[6:05] though you say well that's the Bleak
[6:07] part the good part is the Bible says
[6:09] when that happen the son of man is going
[6:11] to be made known right so that all those
[6:14] things are uh are it's heading up I'm
[6:17] telling you it's getting real close it's
[6:19] heading up oh yeah we're uh we're we're
[6:22] seeing all this absolutely fulfilled
[6:24] before our eyes every day yes every day
[6:27] it's all just going to be a culmination
[6:30] of what's going on okay
[6:35] so just realize one thing you know
[6:37] everybody you know a lot of people I'm
[6:39] like teren said I'd like to know what
[6:40] the message preachers were preaching
[6:42] before talking about Hillary coming in
[6:44] and then now what they say cuz see they
[6:46] thought prophecy listen how many times
[6:49] have we went through a prophecy brother
[6:51] Brown many times he said that's already
[6:53] been fulfilled that's right we didn't
[6:56] even know it I mean he's brought that
[6:57] prophecy and he said sun and the moon
[6:59] turn the blood I was reading it the
[7:00] other day he said that's already
[7:03] happened and he said you Pentecostal
[7:05] you're looking for some great Revival
[7:07] already happened man has always remember
[7:10] what brother brother Brown said he said
[7:12] man's looking back looking forward you
[7:15] see now everybody's looking four years
[7:16] from now to bring up a woman president
[7:18] and hey you know what that may be fine
[7:20] but I hope we're gone by then cuz
[7:22] 2019 is the election year 2020 is
[7:25] election year yeah so I hope we're out
[7:27] of here by then and you know what if it
[7:29] gets it's bad it's supposed to be right
[7:31] so it's supposed to
[7:33] be but some somebody had to come in and
[7:36] lift this thing up because you know what
[7:37] if we fall as a nation you know if you
[7:39] fall from here to here it's not going to
[7:41] hurt you right but if you get up that
[7:44] roof and you fall it's going to hurt you
[7:46] when you hit the ground so we got to get
[7:48] built back up so that this thing can
[7:49] just absolutely fold up and crash and
[7:52] it's going to that's right just a few
[7:53] years just watch it's not going to be
[7:55] not going to be very
[7:56] long but let's get these seals and let's
[7:59] get
[8:00] did let's get sealed in brother L sent
[8:04] me a message last night he said he's
[8:05] been preaching on U sealed unto the day
[8:08] of your Redemption he said boy he said
[8:10] they've been rejoicing over and I said
[8:11] that's good buddy that's good he's been
[8:14] preaching for a brother in Canada while
[8:15] he's up there
[8:17] so uh pray for the Christine's mother
[8:20] not doing well at all um just a few few
[8:23] weeks if the Lord don't intervene maybe
[8:25] even a few days but the dad he's been
[8:29] witnessing salvation to the dad so said
[8:33] he's really opening up and coming around
[8:36] I talked to him or text him last night
[8:38] and uh that's what he told me
[8:42] so so that's uh he he misses us and we
[8:45] miss him I know it's real taxing they're
[8:46] not going to come back till probably the
[8:47] 26th of November so they're going to be
[8:49] gone for a
[8:50] while so just
[8:52] uh pray for them for their finances and
[8:55] all too because man that's a drain on
[8:56] you if you don't work for a couple two
[8:58] three weeks
[9:00] um but the Lord knows all things he
[9:02] works this thing out man he's he knew it
[9:04] for the foundation of the world that's
[9:05] right all right now let's go into the
[9:07] second now the first seal let's cover
[9:09] the first seal the Beast was what the
[9:11] lion l i o n lion all right and we saw
[9:16] the revelation of one God because if you
[9:17] see the mystery of iniquity it doesn't
[9:19] become a mystery
[9:21] anymore it becomes a revelation amen
[9:24] it's a revelation of one true God
[9:26] because what's the first thing they
[9:27] attacked at n the first thing Satan kept
[9:30] attacking even down here with with u
[9:34] with irenius and that man named shus
[9:37] right corinthus right after Jesus died
[9:40] it wasn't very long after Jesus's death
[9:43] he started saying well no Jesus wasn't
[9:45] God Jesus was just a like substance well
[9:47] see that was a saying and that the first
[9:49] seal when Satan goes out it's a saying
[9:51] you start talking about things you start
[9:54] well then with the people don't cut it
[9:55] off it builds to what a deed
[9:59] people start doing it then it becomes a
[10:02] Doctrine all right well we haven't got
[10:03] to the doctrine stage yet because it's
[10:05] got when it becomes a Doctrine see our
[10:07] doctrine of this church is what we are
[10:09] this body of doctrine of church is what
[10:12] we are when we go out there we take the
[10:15] doctrine of this church okay all right
[10:18] so see how important it is to be under
[10:19] the right Doctrine right okay all right
[10:23] and be under a doctrine that can't be
[10:26] unraveled or can't be um uh it can be
[10:29] question yes but it can't be refuted
[10:33] that's right and broke down all right so
[10:36] the first seal if we're going to go by
[10:39] what the prophet of God said when he
[10:40] went to Future home he said I've taught
[10:41] three stages of Grace or three stages of
[10:44] the of the new birth from the beginning
[10:47] and I've never stopped since because the
[10:49] world goes through remember it went
[10:50] through justification and
[10:54] what
[10:55] Noah what baptism Noah
[10:59] know your
[11:00] message what a baptism with Noah then it
[11:04] went through sanctification under
[11:06] what Calvary Jesus dying at the cross
[11:09] shedding his red blood all right and
[11:12] then upon his death burial and
[11:14] resurrection and Ascension he brought
[11:16] back what the Holy Ghost okay you say
[11:20] brother you got you got um white red and
[11:25] black that black but that black ain't
[11:27] bad when you're dead
[11:31] that Black's not bad when you're dead
[11:34] you got to die that's our problem
[11:36] there's too much of us still alive right
[11:39] we got to die so that Christ can what
[11:41] come alive in our life Christ had to die
[11:45] death black to release his
[11:49] life and then you say what about the
[11:52] pale justification sanctification
[11:54] baptism Holy Ghost and the word made
[11:57] flesh when Jesus came out out of the
[11:59] Tomb he sure he was a word made flesh
[12:01] but his body was what
[12:03] glorified those who he is Justified he's
[12:06] already glorified so that's 6 months
[12:08] down the road we'll get to that in a
[12:09] little while but each
[12:11] seal see this is this is what I most
[12:14] people in the message and I'll tell you
[12:15] a little story in a minute most people
[12:17] in the message take the seals and they
[12:18] go oh it's all about the Antichrist it's
[12:19] all
[12:20] negative if it's for the Redemption of
[12:23] your body it can't be negative right
[12:25] it's got to be
[12:26] positive somewhere you got to get the
[12:29] positive aspect of this how you going to
[12:31] get your body changed knowing that the
[12:33] that the Pale Horse was the devil and
[12:34] all the powers wrapped
[12:37] together it don't change nothing yeah
[12:40] but when you come up through the same
[12:41] stages that Jesus went through and you
[12:43] come to that what is the Pale Horse what
[12:47] is the word made flesh it's
[12:50] justification sanctification and the
[12:51] Holy Ghost all in
[12:55] one I preached this down at somebody a
[12:58] church in in Florida I had a couple of
[13:00] ministers come up afterwards and they it
[13:03] was two nights that we had preached it
[13:06] Mama dad was there I think and uh they
[13:10] said brother we ain't never heard nobody
[13:11] preach that this was you know under this
[13:13] was all under justification think this
[13:15] was all under what uh we
[13:18] get we thought it was just the
[13:20] revelation of the
[13:23] devil it is a revelation but of the
[13:26] devil but if it reveals him riding away
[13:28] from you then what have you
[13:33] become listen you can't be the word made
[13:36] flesh Jesus was John 1:14 right and the
[13:40] Word was made flesh right he had no sin
[13:44] right that's the reason he could be the
[13:46] word made
[13:47] flesh we've got to remember though that
[13:50] this came part of sin right it's like we
[13:54] were talking in the Bible
[13:56] study Jesus came into this world knowing
[13:59] where he came from because he had no sin
[14:03] he had no sin barrier he could look back
[14:05] and say before Abraham was I am now he
[14:09] was a liar if he wasn't that but now you
[14:12] and I can't say that in the form he said
[14:14] it that's right right but once we do
[14:16] come to a revelation of who we are we
[14:19] can say I came from God and I go back to
[14:21] God cuz that's exactly what happen what
[14:22] it's doing it's breaking the scales back
[14:24] from our eyes breaking into a revelation
[14:26] that man does not know anything
[14:33] about cuz Jesus was the word made
[14:36] flesh I thought you and I had to be the
[14:38] word made flesh said well we yeah we've
[14:40] got this little sticker called the flesh
[14:41] that's what these seals are to do is to
[14:45] show not just this is this this
[14:48] justification is not just baby form
[14:50] justification when I say baby form that
[14:52] means when somebody comes in
[14:55] um uh let's just anybody anybody that's
[14:59] new here at the church if you come in
[15:01] and sit down and you ask God to forgive
[15:02] you your sins to me that's what we call
[15:05] baby form justification because that is
[15:07] a baby you're still you still have sin
[15:11] but you are
[15:12] Justified right there God forgives you
[15:15] of your past sins and never can bring
[15:16] that up again but now the next day you
[15:19] keep sinning the next day you keep doing
[15:20] the same thing why because the Holy
[15:23] Ghost hadn't done a work of
[15:24] sanctification in your life that's why I
[15:27] believe in those three works of Grace if
[15:28] you don't go through them and don't know
[15:29] you went through them then you just
[15:30] don't have them you
[15:32] bir I'm sorry you just you got and you
[15:34] can't you don't have to put it on a day
[15:37] or a date M because remember it's a
[15:40] process but one day you come to a
[15:42] realization that man you clean me up see
[15:45] see that's the that's the problem most
[15:47] people have cuz we got to talk about New
[15:49] Birth we should have talked about it
[15:50] before but I'm going to talk about it
[15:51] now people in the message and most 99.9%
[15:55] of the people in the
[15:56] world go through a state of
[16:00] justification
[16:02] sure listen if the Bible doesn't say if
[16:05] you're in the message and you believe on
[16:07] the Lord Jesus Christ Thou shalt be
[16:08] saved no the Bible says if you believe
[16:10] on the Lord Jesus Christ Thou shalt be
[16:12] saved now if you die you are saved but
[16:15] you're not
[16:16] bride okay cuz you're not Sanctified
[16:18] you're not
[16:19] cleansed all right God has just picked
[16:21] the glass up that was dirty and nasty
[16:24] but it's still dirty and
[16:25] nasty we must go through the process of
[16:28] sanctification when now now everybody
[16:29] even the Pentecostals most people in the
[16:31] message and most people in the world if
[16:33] they go through a great work of
[16:34] sanctification which means god cleans up
[16:37] cuz see most people say well I know I'm
[16:38] born again cuz I quit smoking I quit
[16:40] drinking I quit
[16:42] gambling that ain't got nothing to do
[16:44] with in New
[16:45] Birth nothing a't got nothing to do in
[16:48] New Birth why Judas did the same
[16:51] thing Judas was so Sanctified he was so
[16:54] close to those disciples that were ready
[16:56] to receive the new birth he was so close
[16:58] to them so they did not know who he was
[17:00] really know who he was and what he was
[17:02] doing they had no
[17:04] clue even right up to the
[17:06] time of of spping in the bowl they had
[17:10] no idea because he was so
[17:15] close
[17:17] but the other ones went on to Pentecost
[17:20] and received they baptism of the Holy
[17:22] Ghost in their soul which burned out
[17:23] died killed that old nature right and
[17:28] God came live done but most people in
[17:31] the message say I quit this and this and
[17:32] this that's good but that's only a state
[17:35] of sanctification I mean if you're still
[17:37] smoking drinking cussing running around
[17:39] I Ain say about bad thoughts I had one
[17:42] other day I thought where in the world
[17:43] that come from well I knew who it come
[17:44] from but why did it come at that moment
[17:47] you know and even brother Danny steaman
[17:49] he made a good point he said you know he
[17:51] said I was praying for somebody one
[17:52] night and he said this evil nasty filthy
[17:56] thought came right through my head
[17:58] that's right and he said I stopped and
[18:00] he he said God you know that what didn't
[18:02] come from me and he continued play
[18:04] praying for the people but it we're
[18:06] human that's the human part go God took
[18:08] this the devil took this if we keep it
[18:10] up here he can play that's right but put
[18:13] it down here and he can't get that's
[18:14] what these seals for remember brother R
[18:16] was talking about the third pull right
[18:18] what is it the first and second the
[18:19] first and second justification and
[18:21] sanctification can be
[18:25] copied but the new birth cannot be
[18:29] copied if you have the real baptism of
[18:31] the Holy Ghost Satan cannot get in your
[18:32] soul he cannot do anything you are
[18:35] absolutely uh like I said I'm still
[18:38] working I'm trying to C cut it down to
[18:40] an hour on the dimensions but your soul
[18:42] is actually in another dimension right
[18:45] where' it come from where did the New
[18:47] Birth come from this Dimension NOP Come
[18:49] From Another Dimension it came into this
[18:52] Dimension and baptize you that's why
[18:54] Paul could say him being a prophet he
[18:56] knew Dimensions he said we're now
[18:57] sitting in Heavenly places right well
[18:59] he's a liar if we're not that's right
[19:02] right we got to go back to the Bible and
[19:04] say well now Paul's lying if we're if
[19:06] that's not what's happening that's right
[19:07] that's right he said we're sitting in
[19:09] Heavenly places in Christ Jesus
[19:11] amen Romans 8:1 there is therefore now
[19:16] no condemnation to them which are in
[19:19] Christ Jesus who walk not after the
[19:20] Flesh in other words don't look at this
[19:23] but after the spirit now we don't start
[19:24] realiz that's why I said I got a
[19:26] revelation the other day hadn't had one
[19:28] in a long long time honestly but when
[19:30] Jesus said the works I do so you do also
[19:35] now how many we read we read that now
[19:36] you say well that's okay you got to get
[19:38] a revelation to that right right cuz the
[19:41] works I do that shall you do also he's
[19:43] lying if we're not going to do the same
[19:45] Works he did right not one person but
[19:48] any many membered body you got to find
[19:50] your place find what you're doing find
[19:52] what you're doing on this Earth M and
[19:55] that's where you're sitting in Heavenly
[19:56] places Satan cannot sit in that place
[19:59] that's right I don't believe Satan can
[20:01] go to the seventh Dimension or the sixth
[20:03] Dimension now five and four 3 2 and one
[20:06] he can run all up and down but now that
[20:07] is preserved for the baptism of the Holy
[20:10] Ghost cuz look Satan can't get in there
[20:12] right he can't get in that sixth
[20:13] Dimension he can't get in the seventh
[20:15] Dimension you say well he talks to God
[20:18] God has to step out to another place you
[20:21] say well Satan's in
[20:22] heaven he's in another dimension okay
[20:25] talking to God
[20:29] but I don't believe he's in that seventh
[20:30] Dimension cuz there's where our future
[20:31] home is right our future home's in that
[20:33] seventh Dimension and it's going to come
[20:36] here six is going to empty up we're
[20:38] going to just step over another
[20:39] dimension God's going to wipe this off
[20:40] and we're going to bring them all back
[20:42] to here right what a mighty God we serve
[20:46] What a Mighty Prophet that could go and
[20:47] tell us all these things and it not be a
[20:50] fable now if he's telling a lie he's a
[20:52] liar but he's not he's telling the truth
[20:56] just like Paul told the truth he's
[20:57] telling us the truth
[20:59] of what's going to happen yes just like
[21:01] all this is happening now all these
[21:03] systems and everything is all political
[21:05] is just rotten into the core and all you
[21:07] know so we just got to we just got to be
[21:09] Christians d right we're if we're
[21:11] Christians then we're you know hide us
[21:13] in your Pavilion so in there in the book
[21:15] of Psalms that's kind of odd that
[21:17] brother Brandon preached a Rapture and
[21:18] he took that scripture hide me in your
[21:22] Pavilion okay you'll understand that
[21:25] maybe in a little while all right let's
[21:27] go the first
[21:30] seal it's the lion of the tribe of Judah
[21:33] the
[21:34] lion to me it shows justification why
[21:38] cuz you're just you're just that's right
[21:41] when you come to the SE revelation of
[21:43] the
[21:45] seals it's not as you if you didn't do
[21:48] it see as if you didn't do it means you
[21:49] did it but there's no record of it when
[21:53] you come to true when you come to a true
[21:55] knowledge that your soul never did any
[21:57] of those things
[22:00] that's not baby form justification
[22:02] that's your highest form of
[22:04] justification that the real you never
[22:06] did it to begin with all right that's
[22:09] what we must come to it because if we
[22:11] don't we're going to be just like
[22:12] everybody
[22:14] else you know Jesus is the same way
[22:17] Jesus didn't have to get up every
[22:18] morning thank God I mean i' I'd love to
[22:20] been in his
[22:22] brain where you don't remember though I
[22:25] mean
[22:26] we Satan reminds us of our sin all the
[22:29] time even what we done 30 40 years ago
[22:33] drive right by a place or go by
[22:35] something and it spark your memory of
[22:36] all that I wish it would be gone but
[22:39] listen God knows that right God knows
[22:42] that and he made a provision God forgive
[22:44] me and go on don't just set what our
[22:46] problem is is we what Satan wants us to
[22:48] stop brother rown said a Christian
[22:50] should never stop that's right what we
[22:53] do is is we stop and let that bird start
[22:55] growing that Nest again right but the
[22:58] best thing to do is is just keep going
[23:01] on
[23:03] um had a thought the other day of some
[23:05] of my past and I just started singing
[23:07] only believe boy the devil don't like
[23:08] that so he just leave he just left he
[23:11] just
[23:12] went just sing only believe all things
[23:15] are
[23:16] possible in after one brother said the
[23:18] angel love is it only believer I love
[23:20] him only believe well I believe if you
[23:22] sing it what what did David do David
[23:24] played that harp and sang and saw the
[23:27] Bible say here we go back to the Bible
[23:29] the Bible says the evil spirits left
[23:32] off you so I can't sing it didn't saying
[23:35] that it said make a joy for North that's
[23:39] right and when so there's your first
[23:41] seal one true and living God because the
[23:44] Revelation 1 through Living God is is
[23:46] that Jesus was almighty God in human
[23:49] flesh and there is an impostor called
[23:53] the devil and he is that mystery of
[23:56] iniquity right all right
[23:59] but if you see a true revelation of one
[24:01] God you can't see a true revelation of
[24:03] one God unless you truly are Justified
[24:05] Sanctified and filled with the Holy
[24:07] Ghost okay because the Devils believe in
[24:10] one God the Bible says the Devils
[24:13] believe in one God and tremble right so
[24:15] I believe in one God so do the devil he
[24:18] knew it before you did
[24:20] that's that's what's so bad is he come
[24:23] down here and split him up in three and
[24:24] he always knew he was one that's right
[24:27] cuz remember it was God created Satan
[24:29] and then there wasn't a whole lot left
[24:31] okay he could talk to him right there
[24:33] you know he that was it wasn't three
[24:35] sitting on a throne that's right but you
[24:37] know what Satan done he just perverted
[24:39] what God said he just took and twisted
[24:41] it and said oh let's make him
[24:44] three Satan's want to be one of them
[24:46] three what he want to be you know if
[24:48] Satan can tear God down then what does
[24:49] he do he elevates himself that's right
[24:53] right so these seals are truly to show
[24:57] The Works of the devil but it's truly
[24:59] the underline between the line is
[25:01] showing you and I that he has no power
[25:06] unless we give it to him
[25:08] amen cuz power was given
[25:14] given given that's right given power was
[25:20] given all right who give Satan
[25:24] power we do
[25:28] cuz remember Satan's still going to be
[25:31] alive and he's going to be on all these
[25:35] horses even in the
[25:39] Millennium the Millennium doesn't kill
[25:41] that's what you got to get the story
[25:44] right in the Millennium this is an
[25:46] atomic blast that's going to blow off
[25:48] the world this is not God's fire this is
[25:51] man's fire that's going to destroy man
[25:53] destroy everything we're going to come
[25:55] back into Millennium and I believe we're
[25:56] going to know where this place is at I
[25:57] mean the buildings are still going to be
[25:59] here because remember he's not going to
[26:00] wipe it off yet right right that's right
[26:03] so Satan is just bound why he has no one
[26:08] to ride with on we have no he has no
[26:12] power see because remember unless we
[26:14] give him the power he has none that's
[26:16] right okay that's why I say I love that
[26:18] scripture says is this the man you look
[26:20] on the side of the road and see a drunk
[26:21] laying there you know all beat up and
[26:24] you know stinking and rotten you look
[26:25] down and say is this the man that that
[26:27] ruined Nations that's the way we're
[26:29] going to look at the Devil once he's
[26:31] defeated in this and we get our we take
[26:33] on the mind of Christ we're going to
[26:35] look at Satan and say man I can't
[26:37] believe that little
[26:39] wimp rule my life yeah all that time I
[26:43] just can't I just you know so it's just
[26:46] the way it
[26:48] is all right let's go now so the first
[26:50] Seal white horse rider God had to start
[26:53] out with a white righteous Church
[26:56] through the three Church ages absolutely
[26:59] because they didn't have doctrines we
[27:00] have to deal with now right had a pure
[27:03] church but it what it
[27:05] became um
[27:08] mixed it
[27:10] became from a saying to a deed to a
[27:13] Doctrine and just a little
[27:15] while and when it becomes a Doctrine
[27:17] then a Doctrine is what you are then in
[27:19] other words you've took it in and it
[27:20] becomes a part of your life okay that's
[27:23] why they say you've been
[27:25] indoctrinated okay so the first thing
[27:29] shows a white righteous church but it
[27:30] also a white righteous true church but
[27:33] it also shows the Antichrist so close so
[27:37] he's going to make you think you got the
[27:38] new birth and you really
[27:40] don't that's close that's all right so
[27:44] so not doing the things you used to do
[27:46] is not a truth of the new birth the
[27:48] truth of the new birth is you can sit
[27:50] down and listen to the word of God being
[27:52] preached to you even if it's preached in
[27:54] contention or error okay at least to
[27:58] show you what the are is we've been
[28:00] sitting in many places and I hate that
[28:02] to say many places we've been sitting in
[28:04] several places three or four I can name
[28:07] listen to a preacher preach and
[28:10] everybody else screaming and shouting
[28:11] and and and the whole row of us that
[28:13] from this church just sit there and from
[28:16] another church just sitting there well
[28:18] I'm not going to shout for something I
[28:20] don't
[28:21] believe so what does that matter because
[28:23] something inside there's a bell went off
[28:26] went right and what happens is is the
[28:28] Holy Ghost inside of you he said he'd be
[28:30] your teacher right now now let's just
[28:33] put it this way brother Dale didn't have
[28:34] to jump up and start preaching to that
[28:36] line of people to make us realize why
[28:38] we're sitting there we knew it
[28:40] already problem with those other people
[28:42] was no I eat grits this
[28:47] morning my granny used to eat grits and
[28:49] she'd still have it on her on her
[28:52] lip in way in the evening we your
[28:55] M Mama does that too I was going to say
[28:57] that
[29:00] but uh it's hereditary it's a it's a
[29:03] genetic
[29:05] thing so anyway what was I
[29:10] saying anyway it it you don't have to be
[29:12] told it's already in you those other
[29:15] people I'm not saying they weren't born
[29:16] again because you can you can you can be
[29:18] an error and be born again but you want
[29:20] listen but once truth is presented
[29:23] here's the here's the difference once
[29:25] you present truth to someone with the
[29:27] Holy Ghost they'll immediately turn
[29:30] right cuz they got to agree with the
[29:33] word that's right right that's right not
[29:35] a big church not you know big this and
[29:37] big this and big that we got to go here
[29:39] because it's a big play no it's the word
[29:42] when that word comes and it's presented
[29:43] to you and you turn it down I doubt that
[29:48] you're born again that's true right but
[29:51] now you can go many many years like a
[29:53] lot of those people never really heard
[29:54] the truth or heard heard you know the
[29:56] truth being preached to them so they
[29:58] shout about what they what they a lot of
[30:01] is emotion but they shout about what you
[30:03] know what they think that's what that
[30:05] the preacher say right okay that's why I
[30:09] said you
[30:10] can you can imitate all that but you
[30:13] cannot take a born again believer and
[30:16] put him to where somebody says something
[30:18] in eror and if it don't some little
[30:21] something
[30:22] go just a little click brother Brown
[30:24] said that little nod all they got in
[30:26] First Church ages he said all they got
[30:28] was a little nod from God that's what
[30:30] brother R said he'd wait for that nod
[30:32] but what was a
[30:33] nod the nod from God put you in
[30:35] relationship with God at the at that
[30:37] moment what he needed for that moment
[30:39] and then what' you do that little what
[30:41] does a nod do if I do like that that
[30:42] means you can come or go or whatever you
[30:44] need to do you're asking a question
[30:46] something's happening and you're going I
[30:48] approve of that
[30:50] agreement agreement I agree with that
[30:52] when he nods he's in agreement that you
[30:54] need to go pray for somebody he's in
[30:56] agreement that what that brother's
[30:57] saying is true true or he's in agreement
[31:00] with you that that's not true when you
[31:03] feel that little pun that little just a
[31:05] little you know just feel somewhere that
[31:07] right you ever been driving somewhere
[31:10] tell you how natural it is you ever been
[31:12] driving somewhere and you
[31:14] go I forgot
[31:18] something but R you never done for no
[31:21] yeah you P Kathy bless her heart depend
[31:24] on her she's going down the road she go
[31:26] I know I forgot something right
[31:30] ready
[31:34] right I pick because she ain't
[31:37] here but have you really well you know
[31:39] what that's in your spirit you're
[31:40] forgetting something and most of the
[31:42] time you'll go through a list in your
[31:43] head and you'll
[31:45] go forgot the batteries or forgot the
[31:48] camera or forgot you know something
[31:49] something why that's a natural thing
[31:52] well same thing with the word of God
[31:53] take that times 10 million now because
[31:56] the word of God is always true that's
[31:58] right there's no error in this word amen
[32:02] so if there's no error in this word you
[32:05] ought to what we ought to have done is
[32:07] is rejoiced after everybody sat down and
[32:09] that we should have jumped up and
[32:11] started rejoicing after that God had
[32:14] revealed or kept
[32:16] us from that error that was being
[32:19] preached see I thank God for that sure
[32:21] it hurts my spirit it really does that
[32:24] others don't see it but but when you
[32:27] when you get alone with God you know you
[32:29] go thank you thank you I appreciate that
[32:31] Lord you you you kept me from something
[32:33] well see to me I think that's the Holy
[32:35] Ghost cuz he said he'd lead you and
[32:36] guide you into all truth amen right so
[32:39] to me that's the true nature of having
[32:41] the Holy Ghost is that every time the
[32:43] true words presented you amen it you may
[32:47] not understand it but something inside
[32:49] of you says that's got to be true let me
[32:51] go study this right cuz we can't go up
[32:53] here with brother Dale and different
[32:54] ones and and just say oh that's all
[32:56] right you know everything's right yeah
[32:58] that's I I understand every bit of it no
[33:00] you you don't that's right sheep have to
[33:02] be
[33:03] led but they look to the shepherd and if
[33:06] he leads them the right way they're
[33:08] happy as they can be right but we as
[33:10] humans though we have to reason things
[33:12] this is our problem we reason it in our
[33:14] head
[33:16] okay I know uh one of you sitting in
[33:18] this building right now says when you
[33:21] say I
[33:23] think back it
[33:25] up cuz you don't say I think you got to
[33:28] know at this point in time in our life
[33:30] we must
[33:31] know certain things you understand and
[33:34] not not being derogatory but just you
[33:35] just and I do the same thing I think it
[33:38] ought to be this way well you ain't gone
[33:40] that's right right and like I was
[33:42] telling somebody yesterday I was telling
[33:44] U I was telling brother Joe and brother
[33:46] Nathaniel we were talking about
[33:47] something something
[33:49] happening and by the way brother Joe
[33:51] Green killed his first deer KN eight
[33:53] point buck and Nathaniel killed a dough
[33:56] yesterday morning so they they all got
[33:58] uh not yesterday morning Friday morning
[34:00] they all got game so they took it all
[34:02] back with them and they said tell you
[34:04] all hello so they had a good time we
[34:06] were talking about something and I said
[34:08] you know God's no is the best yes you'll
[34:10] ever get you've heard me say that many
[34:11] times yes when God says no he knows that
[34:15] when you if you you bring a question to
[34:17] him and he says yes this is the way
[34:19] you're going to go and it's going to end
[34:21] up wrong mhm so if he says no or you get
[34:24] that little check not to do something
[34:26] you better listen to it cuz he knows the
[34:27] end of everything
[34:30] that's now listen with your free moral
[34:32] ageny you can go and do it anyway but
[34:34] you know what you going fail but when
[34:36] God says no you better stand right back
[34:38] there and just wait on the
[34:39] answer to me that's being led by the
[34:41] Lord right okay and that's the same
[34:45] thing with these seals brother brand was
[34:46] led of the Lord to bring this message
[34:48] and like I said many times before it
[34:51] hasn't changed a person yet so there's
[34:52] something in that in this message that's
[34:55] got to be Quicken to us to change CH our
[34:58] body because it's here it's there right
[35:00] it's laid out right here it's in books
[35:02] and tape form it's in the Bible it's
[35:05] laid out for us all we got to do is what
[35:08] walk into it and believe it all right
[35:11] let's read this and then
[35:13] we'll we'll go when he had opened the
[35:16] second seal I heard the second beast say
[35:19] come and see now who is the second
[35:23] beast huh
[35:28] or a beast of burden or you can say a
[35:30] calf because the Bible sometimes in in
[35:32] in one place it says calf but it's a
[35:34] beast of burden what is an ox an ox
[35:37] carries a load it's real slow an ox is
[35:38] not a thoroughbred horse racer no what
[35:42] it takes
[35:43] slow one step at a time one step at a
[35:47] time same way with you and I I've always
[35:50] agreed with brother Dale whole heartly
[35:52] on one point if you see somebody walk in
[35:54] this door and they're on fire with God
[35:56] and they're running down the aisle never
[35:57] running up on top of the tables about 6
[36:00] months later they gone and it's happened
[36:02] many times just in this church yes
[36:06] it but those that sit
[36:08] down and sit there and look at you and
[36:11] watch and observe and sometimes don't
[36:13] even say a
[36:16] word and but they just keep coming right
[36:19] they just keep coming getting a little
[36:21] bit like brother Joe talking about that
[36:23] um Ruth didn't get didn't get two wagon
[36:26] loads of barley right she got handfuls
[36:29] of purpose she picked it up one handful
[36:31] at a time and put it in her little
[36:32] barley sack little little things if
[36:36] you'll do that and just stay under the
[36:37] water
[36:38] spout you'll get wet enough where God
[36:41] will start revealing things to you and
[36:42] then you're then you're in and you're
[36:44] here and you're settled and you're done
[36:45] I don't mean just here I mean you're I
[36:47] believe to me that's the Born Again
[36:48] experience yes cuz many can come in and
[36:51] do that sh be happy and be like you know
[36:54] house on fire on a windy day but all of
[36:55] a sudden what you present the word
[36:59] somewhere you going to present the word
[37:00] it's going to be right here in front of
[37:01] them they're going to go away from it
[37:04] you know you just can't go somewhere
[37:06] else when you're fed well no you just no
[37:10] but now I don't want to be so
[37:11] narrow-minded to say that this is the
[37:12] only place that you need to go okay no I
[37:15] do not I don't think that's true there's
[37:17] other people that have handfuls of
[37:22] purpose denomination for you do that
[37:24] yeah you're a denomination if you do
[37:26] right brother R I was thinking same
[37:27] thing you're a denomination if you think
[37:29] this is it this is the only place to go
[37:30] we can't listen to nobody else no you
[37:33] need to you need
[37:34] to hey you go get things from people
[37:36] that preach error but if you keep look
[37:38] wanting to go to somewhere that's
[37:40] preaching error you got a
[37:42] problem right right all right so let's
[37:46] read the seal now the first seal like I
[37:47] said the first seal was was typing the
[37:50] first three ages it wasn't in the first
[37:51] three typing the first three ages all
[37:53] right I got that cuz you got you got to
[37:55] give a type okay
[37:58] now this next one the second seal is
[38:00] going to be tiped in this thy Tyrant age
[38:03] which is the age of Columba or thyra and
[38:07] it's the longest age the ox it's going
[38:10] to take him longer to get his job done
[38:14] right the
[38:16] lion Now watch how this is going to move
[38:19] up because the lion ox man and Eagle is
[38:25] what the Holy Ghost right the Lono man
[38:29] and Eagle is the Holy Ghost that's what
[38:31] you if you have the Born Again
[38:32] experience you have all four yes right
[38:36] the boldness of a
[38:37] line that laboring like I was talking
[38:39] about get come to church read your Bible
[38:41] study pray all right the man you got to
[38:45] have some form of intelligence and then
[38:47] the eagle you got to go up higher it's
[38:50] really it's outstanding how God does it
[38:52] where you can see it now a Lon is very
[38:55] powerful right very powerful powerful I
[38:58] mean they can just you know they can
[38:59] bite you and break your
[39:01] bones but they can only see so far
[39:03] because they're only about this tall the
[39:04] biggest line in the world is only about
[39:06] this tall right well if a grass is this
[39:08] tall how far can he see can't see far
[39:11] right Revelation he he he's powerful he
[39:15] can get through all that and do what he
[39:16] needs to do but he's only this tall and
[39:18] he can only see if he's out in the grass
[39:20] of the Plains the stuff this tall you
[39:22] can't see very for it see means to
[39:25] understand but now the oxs you know good
[39:28] old o somebody about this T and when
[39:31] they get to look in they look out over
[39:32] that grass but they can't see past the
[39:35] higher bushes you know up to here right
[39:39] little bit more
[39:41] Revelation but not as much as the next
[39:44] one coming up which is a man we stand up
[39:48] 6t tall but what we do is we take our
[39:51] intelligence and we can climb a ladder
[39:54] and see over the trees but we can't get
[39:57] all the way up unless we're in the eagle
[39:59] that's why this is the eagle age that's
[40:01] the age where the eagle goes up he can
[40:04] fly this way he can see all
[40:06] directions in other words unlimited
[40:08] sight he's only limited by how far he
[40:11] can he just keeps going he just keep
[40:13] seeing further if he keeps going he
[40:14] keeps seeing further he's unlimited by
[40:16] his eyesight so that's the way the Holy
[40:18] Ghost is same thing L ox man an eagle
[40:22] the Holy Ghost was is you you you start
[40:24] out you know like the real power and it
[40:26] is powerful keeps going up a little more
[40:28] you can see a little more and you can
[40:29] see a little more so that's a way that
[40:31] the that's the way that as Satan does
[40:34] his work God's doing his work you can't
[40:37] take these seals and make it just the
[40:39] devil okay these seals is a revelation
[40:42] of Jesus
[40:44] Christ in his
[40:47] people I want to add that and that's not
[40:49] adding to but it's not just revelation
[40:51] of Jesus Christ this is revelation of
[40:53] Jesus Christ in his
[40:55] people cuz you see all these Powers the
[40:57] lonox man and Eagle they're Powers how
[41:00] do they work they work through
[41:04] you they work through you all right same
[41:07] way the devil rides through you in other
[41:09] things all right let's read this
[41:11] seal and then we'll make a couple
[41:13] comments and then we'll leave all right
[41:15] we'll pick this up next
[41:16] Sunday and when he had opened the second
[41:19] seal I heard the second beast which was
[41:21] the ox say come and see and there went
[41:23] out another horse Satan gets off of that
[41:27] power that power just keeps on going cuz
[41:29] look you can't tell the people here in
[41:32] this age that they're
[41:34] wrong you going to walk in Baptist
[41:36] Church and say hey y'all all wrong no we
[41:38] not wrong okay so that uh White Horse is
[41:42] still
[41:43] riding all right but he gets on another
[41:46] horse that was red and power was given
[41:52] right power was given M to him that sat
[41:56] there on to take PE be from the earth
[41:59] and that they should kill one
[42:01] another and there was given unto him a
[42:03] sword now he didn't have a sword in the
[42:05] in the in the first first seal he had a
[42:08] bow and no arrows he was bluffing the
[42:10] people but now look what he's got he
[42:13] don't have just a sword he's got a great
[42:14] sword now what's a sword always mean in
[42:16] the Bible word so he's given a word now
[42:20] he's he's conquering and conquered with
[42:22] his deception in the first age but that
[42:24] deception has come now into somebody
[42:28] Pope or whatever you want to call it we
[42:30] always say Pope cuz that's the head but
[42:32] he's got all these up under him Baptist
[42:35] methus Pentecostal they're all undering
[42:37] all
[42:39] right and that they should kill one
[42:41] another and there was given unto him a
[42:42] great sword now there was given unto him
[42:45] a word so you got Ox you got now what is
[42:49] a symbol of
[42:50] red blood what is the symbol of blood
[42:54] sanctification so we're heading into now
[42:56] think of the seal under sanctification
[42:59] but now what happened was this is a
[43:01] literal happening because right here in
[43:04] this church age th tyan Church age this
[43:07] was called the Catholic age that's when
[43:09] 68 million your Fox's book of Martyrs
[43:12] went on during this time right where 68
[43:16] million Christians were killed under the
[43:19] Roman
[43:20] hierarchy killed
[43:23] read killed under the Roman hierarchy by
[43:27] what sure they were literally killed but
[43:29] brother Brown said millions were killed
[43:31] physically but Untold Millions
[43:35] spiritually by that great sword or that
[43:37] great word all right so hang on to that
[43:40] we'll
[43:47] see thank God for the rain yes
