[0:00] thank you for coming out tonight on a
[0:01] Tuesday night and if we were in a boat
[0:03] we would be sinking in this direction I
[0:07] told him it brother bi-lo that's a man
[0:10] they all it must have been these are the
[0:11] coolest or the warmest spot everybody
[0:13] said over on this side it was a big old
[0:15] church - and I mean everybody was over
[0:17] here and it was one person here one over
[0:19] here so I like balance right brother
[0:23] Donny I like balance listen y'all pray
[0:27] for each other
[0:28] coming back from Kentucky the the I
[0:30] don't know what the states are gonna do
[0:33] about these roads but man there was just
[0:35] traffic jams everywhere and I know
[0:37] there's gonna be traffic jams tomorrow
[0:39] and June is gonna be leaving going to
[0:42] her dad's and me and brother Danny's
[0:44] gonna do a little hunting Thursday
[0:46] together and then pray for them coming
[0:48] back because then the roads people are
[0:51] crazy
[0:51] crazy on the highway this is an insane
[0:54] world so let's try to get out of here if
[0:57] you don't mind let's try to leave this
[0:59] place and when we come back again and
[1:02] bear with me because our computer
[1:04] crashed up here so I'm gonna have to
[1:06] read some quotes off of my phone so
[1:07] that's why it's up here but we want to
[1:11] try to see something that to conclude
[1:13] this fourth seal so just keep us in your
[1:15] prayers bow our head please
[1:17] or Jesus thank you for this day that
[1:19] you've given us to come back and your
[1:21] house a little earlier than the middle
[1:24] of the week Lord on a Tuesday night it
[1:27] feels all right it feels refreshing
[1:28] feels good to be in your house father we
[1:31] pray now that you'd be with us and take
[1:33] care of us you be the active participant
[1:35] Lord you'd be the one that does the
[1:36] speaking you'd be the one that does the
[1:39] revealing because without you Lord just
[1:41] be people gathering together for no
[1:44] reason at all but Lord we've come for
[1:46] one common goal and that's to take a
[1:49] body change to destroy death something
[1:52] that no one has ever done on the face of
[1:54] the earth except the Lord Jesus himself
[1:56] but Lord you commissioned it you told us
[1:59] we could do it you gave us the equipment
[2:01] you gave us the word you gave us the
[2:02] trumpet you gave us everything we needed
[2:04] to get out of here so Lord we pray that
[2:07] we'll be all be attentive for a little
[2:09] while Lord and listen to You Father be
[2:12] were the ones that are sick bless the
[2:13] ones that are sick
[2:13] the building you take care of them Lord
[2:15] all the colds and flues and all the
[2:17] different things people are having or do
[2:19] we were buchen in the name of Jesus
[2:21] Christ we do not have to have that amen
[2:24] we do not have to have that and Lord you
[2:27] healed us at Calvary the prophet of God
[2:29] said if you were standing here at the
[2:31] pulpit tonight you could not heal us
[2:33] because you already did it at Calvary
[2:35] if either with your arms stretched wide
[2:37] and when you said it's finished you
[2:39] meant what you said Lord we pray that
[2:41] you just be with us now and take care of
[2:43] us lead us and guide us by your Holy
[2:44] Spirit be with the missionaries on the
[2:47] foreign fields Lord give them fruit for
[2:49] their labor father just be with us now
[2:50] take care of us in Jesus name Amen and
[2:53] when he had opened the fourth seal I
[2:55] heard the voice of the fourth beast say
[2:57] come and see
[2:58] and I looked and behold a pale horse and
[3:00] his name that sat on him was death and
[3:02] hell followed with him and power was
[3:04] given unto them over the fourth part of
[3:06] the earth to kill with the sword and
[3:07] with hunger and with death and with the
[3:09] beasts of the earth he may be seated in
[3:11] the Lord at his blessing to the reading
[3:13] of the word there by all rights a man
[3:15] ma'am and I like that because I wanted
[3:19] to find this quote where brother where
[3:20] I'm said it and I couldn't get it worded
[3:22] exactly right but brother Branham says
[3:25] talk we were talking about you know
[3:27] death having to be destroyed and he said
[3:31] see there there goes death and held
[3:32] together so well we don't listen as
[3:35] bride of Jesus Christ
[3:37] those two words should not mean anything
[3:39] to us as part as far as fear is
[3:42] concerned amen
[3:44] because death and hell we have no part
[3:46] with that Jesus Christ said in
[3:48] Revelations that he had the keys to
[3:50] death and hell and then the devil don't
[3:52] have the keys to death and death and
[3:54] he'll bow you know what we we give him
[3:56] all the glory for having death and hell
[4:00] in his arms well he don't own nothing he
[4:03] owns zero amen that's what we've got to
[4:07] see for you know brother Branham I asked
[4:10] him said but brother Branham what about
[4:11] this change he said it's just a change
[4:14] it's just a change he in other words he
[4:19] couldn't explain it any better than it
[4:21] already been explained or he would have
[4:24] explained it better right that's what he
[4:27] came to do
[4:27] came in to give us the love letter the
[4:29] love letter says we will be changing
[4:31] we're gonna talk about that tonight
[4:32] because the Bible says we shall all be
[4:35] changed and then but we're gonna
[4:39] background just a minute
[4:40] for those that that and I say those I
[4:44] say me that needs a little refresher
[4:46] course on what we've been speaking them
[4:47] because remember there's four things
[4:49] it's got to happen we'll read them later
[4:50] on because I want to break them down but
[4:53] let's turn to can you let him pull up
[4:55] Johnny leaven we were talking about
[4:56] Jesus Jesus said unto her thy brother
[4:59] shall rise again Martha said unto him I
[5:02] know that he shall rise again in the
[5:04] resurrection at the last day
[5:05] well okay we're at the resurrection of
[5:09] the last day but jesus said I am he
[5:12] brought an ever present opportunity for
[5:16] them to have right then I am the RET in
[5:18] other words I carry the Resurrection
[5:21] with me amen so as I was telling the
[5:23] people in in Kentucky if if we go back
[5:27] to being heirs and joint heirs then what
[5:29] is our problem saying I am the
[5:33] resurrection and the life he that
[5:35] believeth in me now not just in meat
[5:37] weight Dale you got to believe in the
[5:40] God believe in the God that we serve you
[5:43] got to have faith I'll read it to you in
[5:44] just a minute we're brother Browns says
[5:47] we got to have faith but then he says
[5:52] faith alone won't do it faith alone
[5:56] won't do it you gotta have faith virtue
[5:59] knowledge temperance you got to have
[6:00] virtue faith knowledge Spade temperance
[6:02] faith patience faith godliness faith
[6:04] brotherly kindness faith and love which
[6:06] is the epitome of faith hey ma'am
[6:12] Jesus had to believe his own Word and if
[6:15] he if he's not exempt from it neither we
[6:18] but we got to believe our word we got to
[6:22] come to a place to that stature of a
[6:23] perfect man is a leaving living
[6:26] breathing as brother Dale was talking
[6:27] about in in travail brother Brown said a
[6:29] living breathing instrumentality of God
[6:32] when our feet move God's feet moves when
[6:35] our hands move God's hands move see I
[6:38] just wanna you know they kind of looked
[6:39] at me a little cross
[6:41] like some of you do the same here when I
[6:43] said we were more tunas than we were
[6:45] anything else and we are we're pushing
[6:46] everything on Jesus and he's going to do
[6:48] all this
[6:49] he gave the Commission to you and I he
[6:53] said I whatever I have I give to thee I
[6:56] am the resurrection and the life I've
[6:59] come from God I go back to God eat my
[7:01] flesh and drink my blood all those
[7:05] things he gave us those things and said
[7:07] look in other words you got to take part
[7:10] of me because that word there eat
[7:11] doesn't mean
[7:12] eat that means consume it means to it
[7:15] means to take in and then because what
[7:18] happened when I when Eve and Adam ate
[7:21] the fruit they eat it they didn't eat it
[7:26] right they / took of it in other words
[7:31] they / took of the act then that was the
[7:33] eating part and then when it says John
[7:36] told John to eat the book it didn't mean
[7:39] to eat the physical book it means to
[7:42] partake of that and when you partake of
[7:45] it it becomes nourishment to your body
[7:47] and then when you partake of this it
[7:50] becomes nourishment to what that inner
[7:52] man the real you the one that really
[7:54] makes a difference jesus said unto her I
[7:57] am the resurrection and the life he that
[8:00] believeth in me though he were dead yet
[8:04] shall he live now look at that though he
[8:07] were dead that's not dead in the grave
[8:11] that's dead in trespasses and sin yet
[8:16] shall he live because I live you live
[8:20] also you saw what we've got so many
[8:21] millions of people in the grave they're
[8:23] more alive than we are that is just a
[8:26] shell that there that they left they
[8:29] left the shell here and took the real
[8:31] person somewhere else and then so that's
[8:34] what the problem is he said well they're
[8:39] all dead and gone well no they're not
[8:41] dead they're not dead yet because
[8:44] remember in the Bible when when the
[8:48] Pharisee said told Jesus said they might
[8:50] our Father to eat manna in the
[8:51] wilderness now when jesus said they were
[8:54] that was a different date when Jesus
[8:58] said you're dead when Jesus Christ says
[9:01] you're dead you're dead and brother
[9:04] Brahim said that translated to eternally
[9:06] separated from God
[9:08] that's how harsh that was they were
[9:09] eternally separated from God now that's
[9:12] the death remember the Bible says don't
[9:14] worry about the guy that can kill this
[9:16] thing because God can only bring a soul
[9:19] and God can only kill a soul amen
[9:23] Satan cannot kill a soul he has no power
[9:26] to do that he didn't bring it here
[9:29] he perverted it when it got here but he
[9:32] didn't bring it here so he has no power
[9:34] over that I've said many times before
[9:39] you take a saint that's getting ready to
[9:42] pass over to the other side I just
[9:44] and I'm not glorying that people pass
[9:47] away but I just like to be standing
[9:49] there and about in the in that dimension
[9:50] with them as they get ready to pass that
[9:53] poor death angel will have a look on his
[9:55] face like he's never had before because
[9:57] he's never had to deal with a live wire
[9:59] like like he's fixing that I have to
[10:01] deal with he's having to deal with an
[10:03] eternal person they just stepped out of
[10:06] a body and he don't he don't get that
[10:09] opportunity much most of his opportunity
[10:12] is is he's going to take them in change
[10:15] to that fifth dimension hello he's going
[10:17] to take them into that fifth dimension
[10:19] for condemnation but when he sees that
[10:23] like brother Brown said you know what
[10:25] death is our slave death takes us to God
[10:31] the death angel I he's just for me out
[10:34] the death angel would justify the death
[10:36] angel I just wouldn't put my hands on a
[10:37] believer because he's going right
[10:40] straight into that sixth dimension he's
[10:42] eternal as he ever will be he's eternal
[10:45] is he ever gonna be amen oh that's good
[10:48] I love them third Exodus watch new show
[10:51] ever liveth and believeth in me shall
[10:53] never die believe this now this now the
[10:57] problem was is they were pushing it like
[10:59] I said like we do they were pushing it
[11:01] somewhere else pushing it off on
[11:05] somebody else Marcus in other words
[11:07] Martha said Lord
[11:08] I don't believe you can do that right
[11:11] now
[11:13] but now I know that my brother will
[11:15] raise in the general resurrection right
[11:18] but jesus said I am the resurrection
[11:21] whatever you think is going to be there
[11:23] if standing in front of you here amen
[11:26] and where is he today where's the a
[11:31] brother John he's sitting right there in
[11:33] that seat they Church setting in hey man
[11:37] it ain't crowded either ain't three of
[11:40] you then two of you there's one of you
[11:43] that's our problem when we get the new
[11:45] birds we really don't understand what we
[11:47] get I don't think you get God you get
[11:52] the resurrection you get you get the
[11:56] Creator you get the person that said let
[11:59] there be that's who that if not you got
[12:02] a second person like I said here we go
[12:05] right I hope yeah one day one day we're
[12:11] all going to get this statement the
[12:14] reason we can get a revelation is that
[12:17] the person that wrote this book is
[12:19] looking at the book again the very
[12:23] reason we can get around why there's
[12:25] other people why does the devil can't
[12:27] even understand the Word of God because
[12:30] you don't have the guy that wrote it
[12:32] looking down through his eyes
[12:35] who was that that was at church was it
[12:37] your daddy or who was it said devil
[12:40] somebody in the message said devil if
[12:43] you're gonna run around in my head we
[12:45] fixing to read the Bible and if you're
[12:48] still up there you're gonna see what I'm
[12:49] reading and it ain't gonna be good for
[12:51] you that's why I like it if the devil is
[12:54] gonna roam around in my brain I'm gonna
[12:56] start reading something that he don't
[12:57] like amen but you know what the one that
[13:01] wrote it is inside of you that's the
[13:04] deal that to me that's the whole seal
[13:06] the seal put him in put Satan out and
[13:09] you're done you're sealed I am the
[13:13] resurrection and the life he that
[13:14] believeth in me though he were dead yet
[13:18] shall he live we were all dead remember
[13:20] we were all born dead
[13:22] we're more alive now than we ever be
[13:23] that all right say ma'am we're more
[13:27] alive now than we'll ever be
[13:30] whosoever liveth and believeth in me
[13:32] shall never die
[13:33] believe it's down there now the third
[13:37] accident excuse me
[13:39] 1963 let's get through these and then
[13:41] we'll get to the end I don't want to be
[13:44] too long tonight so that's the way it is
[13:47] again today God is calling his elected
[13:49] people and they are elected now and now
[13:52] they elected for what for a resurrection
[13:54] now look to have a resurrection you got
[13:58] to have two people two sets of people
[14:03] living and going on amen so now we are
[14:11] elected what for a resurrection and what
[14:14] kind of a sign is he's showing them
[14:16] resurrection sign now remember even
[14:19] though jesus said now watch this this is
[14:21] how powerful it is in the end time and
[14:24] we'll get to it in a few minutes what
[14:25] brother Brown said about this but when
[14:28] Jesus was standing at the tomb of
[14:29] Lazarus he knew he was going to
[14:31] resurrect Lazarus I am the resurrection
[14:35] and the life there's in other words
[14:36] there's nothing gonna stop me from doing
[14:38] this nothing
[14:41] no devil in hell no death nothing
[14:43] everything's got a part but it's only
[14:46] temporary
[14:48] it's only temporary because lives are
[14:52] resurrected not in a glorified body
[14:56] Lazarus resurrected it no sure he got
[14:59] change
[15:00] oh he got to change all right because
[15:03] Martha said Lord he stinketh well he
[15:06] doesn't starting corruption but God
[15:09] reversed that process showing that he's
[15:12] going to reverse your process same way
[15:15] with Abraham showing you can reverse my
[15:17] what about the three Hebrew children I
[15:19] was thinking about this the other day
[15:20] what a body change you know we worry
[15:21] about this body change being a brand new
[15:23] thing the three Hebrew children got
[15:28] thrown into a fire that was so red-hot
[15:31] it burnt up the other people right
[15:34] their clothes were even their clothes
[15:39] were even anointed and the Bible says
[15:45] and the Bible is real specific it says
[15:47] and you couldn't even smell with smoke
[15:49] on them you know you think well you know
[15:52] I think well he got in the fire now
[15:54] because I smell him no the Bible says
[15:57] not even his clothes not even their
[16:00] clothes now what kind of a body changed
[16:02] you put your body in there God changed
[16:05] their body but it was only a temporary
[16:07] change God had to change Elijah's body
[16:11] he had to change Moses body because they
[16:15] went somewhere in their human body hello
[16:20] right Philip got translated he got a
[16:25] body change because you can't just
[16:27] translate I sure wish we could have
[16:29] translated ourselves from Kentucky all
[16:31] the way back to here for all that
[16:32] stinking traffic we went through was
[16:34] gonna try to get here time enough to
[16:35] hear in the back ok time enough to be
[16:40] here for the first service but I mean
[16:41] the beginning of the service but we
[16:43] couldn't because the traffic I would
[16:44] love to be able to transport myself but
[16:48] it would have only been temporary
[16:50] anything we have dealt with before has
[16:53] just been temporary even though jesus
[16:56] said I'm the resurrection in the life in
[16:58] other words if you believe in me you'll
[16:59] never die now Lazarus died again Lazarus
[17:03] was only brought back to a spot he was
[17:09] probably swelling up and I was thinking
[17:10] and they said his nose offense look God
[17:13] had to bring him a temporary
[17:14] resurrection you and I we've had
[17:17] temporary resurrections we've had people
[17:18] raised from the dead we've been part of
[17:20] that ourselves to see people raised up
[17:23] from the dead we see that Jesus raised
[17:25] several people from the dead the prophet
[17:28] of God raised several people and you
[17:31] don't know what I mean Jesus did it but
[17:32] through the Prophet he raised those
[17:34] people up from the dead they got a
[17:36] temporary resurrection but if time goes
[17:39] on that same man that I held in my arms
[17:41] it was dead he's getting older and he's
[17:42] getting more feeble and he's probably
[17:44] gonna just pass all
[17:46] but he had a temporary resurrection
[17:48] that's not what I'm even talking about
[17:50] this 4-cyl death in hell shows their
[17:54] self leaving leaving the same death in
[18:00] hell power was given unto them over the
[18:02] fourth part of the earth and his name
[18:04] that sat on him was death and hell
[18:05] followed after him they left they left
[18:10] the building
[18:11] they left the building and that for sale
[18:15] we're going to see but now we're going
[18:17] to see though when we come into the
[18:18] fifth seal the fifth seal is going to
[18:22] show to me how this works
[18:25] okay you got four seals and then we take
[18:29] a rapture you say well it's letting the
[18:30] rest of us for for the Jews that's
[18:32] exactly correct but you and I have to
[18:35] get the opening of that seal you and I
[18:37] have to get the opening of the sixth
[18:38] seal and you and I have to get the
[18:40] opening of the seventh seal right so we
[18:41] have to get that to get the fullness to
[18:45] take a body change because remember when
[18:49] Jesus stepped out of the tomb and said
[18:50] all power in heaven and earth has been
[18:51] given unto me now there's the spot
[18:55] because when he come out of that tomb
[18:57] that body that he was in went through a
[19:00] change but it didn't change and he
[19:03] walked back out and looked like that
[19:05] again or that one whichever one doesn't
[19:07] matter we looked he didn't look thirty
[19:09] something years old he looked 50
[19:11] something years old he was so young Mary
[19:14] Magdalene didn't even know who he was
[19:15] the people in Emmaus didn't even know
[19:18] who he was
[19:19] amen they didn't know who he was because
[19:21] he had changed back to his original his
[19:25] original condition that's our whole part
[19:29] to me this message brings us back to our
[19:32] original condition amen I figured
[19:37] somebody tried to call me while I had
[19:39] this stupid thing up there welcome teams
[19:43] denied I mean people call young Hughes
[19:44] you know they know not to call me in
[19:48] Wednesday night so they call that's why
[19:50] I turn to put it on silent I knew
[19:52] somebody called booth devil not the
[19:55] person that called he's a nice guy
[19:58] so what are we elected for though we've
[20:02] got a resurrection sign the son of man
[20:04] give us the resurrection sign but listen
[20:09] to me you and I have to carry the rest
[20:11] of it out everything else has been
[20:16] temporary till the Son of Man walked out
[20:18] of the tomb and said all power in heaven
[20:21] there's been given to me in other words
[20:23] I do not have to go back to being an old
[20:25] man again I do now I have been changed
[20:28] and I'm done I'm finished and all if you
[20:33] don't believe it touch me give me some
[20:38] fish cuz I believe Oh doubting Thomas
[20:41] probably looked at me and said a fish is
[20:44] gonna hit the floor soon as he eats it
[20:46] right cuz then we think of a ghost we
[20:49] think of somebody has no substance they
[20:52] saw him walk through the wall and then
[20:54] and you know they probably said that's
[20:56] fish go hit the floor no it went into
[20:58] something very solid it became a part of
[21:02] Jesus what do you think that's going to
[21:04] happen we even when we have a glorified
[21:05] body we're going to go across the
[21:07] curtain of time and we're going to eat
[21:10] grapes and we're going to eat apples and
[21:11] we're going to eat whatever and it's not
[21:14] going to fall through and it's going to
[21:16] what it's going to become a part of us
[21:19] to me folks that's this this is what to
[21:22] me all these examples are showing us how
[21:27] simple because be honest with me we've
[21:30] all even in the denomination we're even
[21:33] in this message we have put the body
[21:36] chain way up here and we're right here
[21:41] doesn't matter how good we are and if we
[21:42] live with good life we're Christian yeah
[21:44] we believe the message and we are filled
[21:46] with the Holy Ghost and we are part of
[21:48] the statue of a perfect man we're trying
[21:49] our best to grow up but still we have
[21:51] put it so unreachable Jesus just walked
[21:56] over to him said I'm here all power in
[22:02] heaven there's been getting under me and
[22:03] I give this unto you you are a recipient
[22:10] of what I have
[22:11] done-for-you believe us now this but it
[22:18] was the son of man I'm not gonna get
[22:20] done gonna get finished let's go who is
[22:22] this son of man what he's the one that
[22:24] sowed the seed when the Son of man came
[22:26] on the earth he had one purpose in mind
[22:30] he sowed the good seed he sowed the
[22:34] ability for me and you to get here and
[22:36] have a chance to be saved now he knew
[22:41] who we were
[22:42] he sowed ever good seed because he knows
[22:45] what good seed he's got you and I don't
[22:48] know that because by the power of
[22:53] transformation though we were this right
[22:54] here this is the seed of the wicked one
[22:59] produced by holy parents but still not
[23:05] the way we were supposed to come but the
[23:09] tares are the children of the wicked one
[23:10] but now this is talking about the tares
[23:13] that's the children that never come to
[23:15] nothing the good seed is the children of
[23:18] the kingdom you and I are the children
[23:19] of the kingdom amen you and I are the
[23:21] children the kingdom Happy Thanksgiving
[23:24] Matthew 16 verse 13 when Jesus came to
[23:27] the coasts of Caesarea Philippi asked
[23:28] the disciple whom to use men whom do men
[23:31] say that I the Son of Man a.m.
[23:33] they said some say you're drunk nella
[23:36] there wasn't he paying attention to what
[23:38] Jesus says because he said whom do men
[23:41] say that I the Son of man I am
[23:43] they said some say that thou art John
[23:45] the Baptist well they knew he went John
[23:47] the Baptist cuz they saw John and him
[23:50] some he lied you know there may be
[23:53] another's Jeremiah one of the prophecies
[23:55] there now hold on
[23:56] who do you saying I've been with you for
[23:59] three and a half years who do you say I
[24:00] am Simon Peter Peter says thou art the
[24:04] Christ the Son of the Living God in
[24:06] other words like we've always said that
[24:08] Peter got that revelation from God he
[24:11] didn't come up with that himself or he
[24:15] would have not denied him three times at
[24:17] the crucifixion and he would have not
[24:19] went fishing when Jesus was resurrected
[24:22] they didn't have a revelation really who
[24:24] he was
[24:25] please they didn't but he said thou art
[24:29] the Christ in other words I see
[24:31] something in you that no other man can
[24:33] do you know Peter said die alone have
[24:38] the words of eternal life
[24:40] he just said blessed are You Simon bar
[24:42] Jonah for flesh and blood has not
[24:44] revealed that to you in other words he
[24:46] didn't get it from us flesh and blood
[24:47] but my father which is in heaven I say
[24:49] unto thee that thou art Peter and upon
[24:51] this rock I'll build my church and the
[24:53] gates of Hell will try but shall not
[24:56] prevail against them now that is a 2000
[25:02] year promise if we had the church age
[25:08] there somewhere it's a 2000 year promise
[25:11] that the church is going to be built on
[25:13] the revelation that you are a believer
[25:16] that Jesus Christ has died for you came
[25:20] back give his life to you if you accept
[25:23] him and you become a Christian is that
[25:26] just kind of by that's the basics of
[25:28] what we get no one no one ever brought
[25:33] it so strong as the prophet of the end
[25:36] times to do with your body something to
[25:40] do with your spirit realm no the Bible
[25:43] says believe on the Lord Jesus Christ
[25:45] and thou shalt be saved that's what he
[25:48] built his church on and he was well
[25:50] pleased with that God was just as well
[25:53] pleased when he came down to Martin
[25:54] Luther and gave him the baptism of the
[25:56] Holy Ghost as he did when he gave it to
[25:57] me or you amen but Martin Luther had a
[26:01] what had a mandate to live by the Box
[26:05] Wesley had a box
[26:06] Pentecost but you and I ready just a min
[26:09] ago you and I have been elected for a
[26:12] resurrection amen elected to destroy
[26:16] death because the fourth seal tells you
[26:19] that death is destroyed tells you that
[26:20] hell has nothing to hold on you the
[26:22] fourth seal tells you that it's done
[26:25] tells you that it's finished when we
[26:27] take a rapture listen we're done there's
[26:31] no more development after that oh well
[26:35] yeah God goes to Israel in it but listen
[26:37] we know how
[26:38] to stand before a white throne judgment
[26:40] Oh hallelujah that's things giving
[26:41] enough for me don't have to go to hell I
[26:46] already been there we lived in part of
[26:49] it most of us life amen but don't have
[26:53] to any of that doesn't that to me listen
[26:55] that should take the fear out what do
[26:58] you fear what do you fear if you're born
[27:02] again you should have no fear brother
[27:05] Branham when he went across that curtain
[27:07] of time he said I come back he said I
[27:09] always had a little bit of fear about
[27:11] death he said Lord why would you fear
[27:13] that that's what our problem is let me
[27:19] ask you a question have you ever sat
[27:21] down in the quietness of the evening or
[27:23] sometimes when you didn't have no
[27:24] nothing else running through your brain
[27:25] it's hard for most of us but have you
[27:29] ever had a moment know come in sin have
[27:32] you ever had a moment when you just and
[27:33] I'm going to be real real plain I have
[27:37] sat down and thought about eternity and
[27:39] I can't get a whole grasp on that
[27:43] because with so much time creatures how
[27:46] can we get to a place where we'll never
[27:48] cry never have a pain I love you never
[27:54] have a bad thought about kids or family
[27:57] we've never been through that so it's
[28:01] something new it's something and you
[28:03] fight that in yourself do you know what
[28:07] scares me I think of eternity and I'm
[28:11] like man that's a long time we're so
[28:17] much stinking time creatures till we go
[28:21] to Mars just gonna be today again and
[28:24] then you know ten thousand years from
[28:27] now just you're not even a second older
[28:29] Kathy hallelujah you can go to Japan
[28:34] like that travel like I saw but see that
[28:37] but you know you know what we have to do
[28:39] though with all that the Bible says cast
[28:41] down reasoning because what I'm doing is
[28:43] I'm sitting there reasoning the thing
[28:45] out reasoning the thing out when we
[28:51] should say okay
[28:52] Jesus you've been through every bit of
[28:54] this you've been in this dimension of
[28:58] hell you've been in this dimension of
[29:00] heaven you've been in this dimension in
[29:03] a in a in a body that was dying this
[29:07] dimension when he come in as a baby
[29:09] suffered through 30-something years of
[29:11] his life died went through death a
[29:15] horrible death not just death a horrible
[29:17] death survived survived and came out
[29:23] pretty good so he's done now now where
[29:28] is that person one more time where is
[29:31] that person brother John he's sitting
[29:35] right there looking at me that's our
[29:41] problem
[29:42] Jesus is over here we're over here well
[29:45] we can well that was good he'd come out
[29:47] of that tomb know you know what's going
[29:49] to bring the people out of the tomb is
[29:51] the same feeling not feeling you
[29:54] understand what I mean but the same
[29:55] thing is going to come over us they came
[29:57] over Jesus and it's going to bring them
[29:59] right out of that tomb because he's
[30:03] already here residing in the vessel that
[30:07] he wants to reside in he's pleased to
[30:10] dwell in you if he's pleased to dwell in
[30:13] you they something you got to do hey
[30:24] alright say man so he built the church
[30:27] on the revelation that if those that
[30:30] believe in me shall never die
[30:34] never perish but have eternal life but I
[30:38] can't think of a stronger time to be in
[30:43] as now to where we can really believe
[30:46] that God can change this thing this
[30:49] thing as long as what he's already done
[30:52] inside you you understand what I'm
[30:55] saying all the other church agents we
[30:57] went through that remember the porter
[30:58] they would come up they would go through
[31:00] their church age they would die off
[31:02] another church age messenger will come
[31:04] up take them through the church age did
[31:05] he'd die they'd start dying off they'd
[31:08] come back up and come to another church
[31:09] age come down come to Pentecost comes up
[31:12] brother Brown said this is it we're
[31:16] either going to hell or we're going to
[31:18] heaven there's no in-between we're not
[31:20] going to another church age that brother
[31:22] so-and-so in this day in time mister
[31:25] so-and-so he's gonna give us another
[31:28] message this is it that's why he said
[31:32] our mandate is to get the people out of
[31:35] the ground and they gotta have a live
[31:38] people to get the dead people out only
[31:42] might come dead people sleeping people
[31:45] remember why I been reading in the book
[31:48] of Acts again I told him I said think
[31:53] about this if you want to know how the
[31:56] Son of man Act read Matthew Mark Luke
[31:58] and John that's all you got to do then
[32:01] when he left when he left if you want to
[32:06] know what the Son of God acts like read
[32:09] the book of Acts because that was the
[32:11] act to the Son of God inside the people
[32:13] then go over to revelations and read
[32:16] where the Son of man has come back in
[32:18] the end time the beginning of the
[32:22] creation of God and you and I are a
[32:29] continuation of that creation everybody
[32:34] okay proving his word let's read this
[32:37] and go on proving his word in 1964 after
[32:42] nineteen hundred years the church aged
[32:44] past no watch this brother Brian was
[32:45] telling us in 1964 and all the things he
[32:49] prophesied of Luther Wesley we just went
[32:51] through and seen it brought out moon
[32:53] come down brought her down the Lord
[32:54] brought it on the board here for us and
[32:56] showed it and come down himself and
[32:58] confirmed confirmed it to be right after
[33:00] or not you see where he's standing he's
[33:02] standing in his positive place he know
[33:05] God's revealed that because God came
[33:07] down and vindicated him so whatever he
[33:09] had to preach about the search agents
[33:10] was true I don't care one another any
[33:12] other man says about it all right and he
[33:14] didn't either
[33:16] after 1900 years and we're at the end of
[33:19] Laodicean church a we're at the end of
[33:23] the Leveson because remember the
[33:24] messenger comes at the end of the age
[33:26] okay all right cuz watch even when
[33:31] brother Branham came on the scene listen
[33:33] to what I'm saying
[33:34] catch this when brother BAM came on the
[33:35] scene he was preaching the Son of God
[33:37] revelation getting the faith of the
[33:41] father's back which was not the Son of
[33:43] Man revelation that was the son of God
[33:46] revelation that the church was built on
[33:48] they had got so far off of it till he
[33:52] had to bring them back to where they
[33:54] started at brother Dale's preaching on
[33:56] it now but now watch now this is
[34:00] something different
[34:02] when those seals open that was the son
[34:05] of man revelation no man had ever
[34:09] preached that before he promised now
[34:12] we're at the end of the layout of
[34:14] century and he promised that's why you
[34:17] got to remember the Laodicean Church
[34:19] ages what age number seven that's not an
[34:26] eight that's seven seven seven is 49
[34:30] you're still in the old order of sevens
[34:33] no rapture in that okay but now watch he
[34:40] promised in Luke 17 thirty that this
[34:42] same son of man he promised it would be
[34:44] revealed in the days like it was inside
[34:46] him upon the earth did he do it doesn't
[34:49] have to come to pass that's impossible
[34:51] now remember it doesn't say no he's not
[34:52] saying again and he doesn't say it's
[34:54] impossible he's fixing to say it's
[34:56] impossible for it not to happen now
[34:59] remember he comes in three names son of
[35:01] man prophet son of God spirit son of
[35:05] David in the Millennium but in between
[35:06] this conjunction now according to his
[35:09] own words well I said brother Branham
[35:11] had to work through the Son of God
[35:12] revelation to get us back to a place
[35:14] that the son of man could step out hey
[35:18] alright with that in the days now
[35:21] according to his own words in the day
[35:23] when the Son of man shall be revealed
[35:26] reveal himself is what not son of God
[35:30] son of man will reveal his self
[35:33] in a different way because the Son of
[35:36] God revelation cannot bring a body
[35:39] change son of God don't need a body to
[35:45] the certain of God is the change when
[35:49] that man stood and said let there be
[35:50] light he hadn't changed since then
[35:54] he needed a change
[35:56] but now the son of man came down on
[35:59] earth the born as a baby
[36:01] hey man son of God inside that baby but
[36:06] the son of man was on the earth doing
[36:07] the talking doing the what sowing of the
[36:09] seed he needed a body change I read them
[36:15] I read that up it in Kentucky where
[36:18] brother Branham said Jesus Christ
[36:20] inherited something he didn't inherit
[36:23] eternal life in his soul or his spirit
[36:25] he because he was Almighty God he was
[36:27] eternal but his body had a beginning and
[36:30] the inheritance that he inherited I wish
[36:34] that I brought that quote the
[36:35] inheritance he inherited he didn't keep
[36:37] it most of you now here in the building
[36:43] most people in this world would that
[36:46] Veda went through that they to come out
[36:49] and said all power in heaven earth been
[36:52] given unto me and blessed God I got it
[36:54] you ain't and I ain't giving it to
[36:56] nobody not God soon as he got it he was
[37:02] so happy about it he started giving it
[37:05] to you but he had to wait according to
[37:08] his own word listen our God is according
[37:11] to his own word he had to wait 2,000
[37:14] years to have somebody on the earth that
[37:18] I believe that same thing he believed to
[37:22] change their body I just got that that's
[37:26] good
[37:29] it does happen every once in a while but
[37:34] he'll reveal itself in a different way
[37:37] listen you and I have to be a different
[37:40] group of people
[37:42] and you don't have to make yourself
[37:45] different you just start talking about
[37:47] the Son of Man and what the Son of Man
[37:49] revelation is and how brother branham
[37:51] message was in two parts you'll see if
[37:54] they believe you or not
[37:55] real quick not saying they're not
[37:59] Christians I'm just saying some King
[38:00] some kid some could take the Son of God
[38:02] revelation and some can take the Thunder
[38:04] man revelation because that revelations
[38:08] the son of man you've got to have that
[38:10] to change your own body brother Dale
[38:13] can't change your body I can't change
[38:16] your body you got to have it already
[38:19] inside of you to change your body you do
[38:23] it's your choice john 6:53 we're doing
[38:34] it
[38:36] jesus said beylerbeyi I saying to you
[38:38] except you eat the flesh of the Son of
[38:40] Man and drink his blood you have no life
[38:43] in you whosoever he is my flesh and
[38:46] drinketh my blood hath eternal life and
[38:49] I will raise him up at the last day for
[38:52] my flesh is meat indeed and my blood is
[38:54] drink indeed he that eateth my flesh and
[38:57] drinketh my blood dwelleth in me
[39:01] dwelling in me and I him that's pretty
[39:08] personal as the living father has sent
[39:11] me and I live by the father so he that
[39:12] eateth me even he shall live by me this
[39:16] is that bread which came down from
[39:18] heaven you see what two people Israel
[39:20] got they got God but they thought this
[39:23] is getting bread and they just
[39:24] absolutely got tired of it after a while
[39:27] that's like most people around the
[39:29] message they been in the message 30
[39:31] years now they're getting tired of this
[39:32] man huh they gonna go find them
[39:34] something else right they loathe this
[39:39] bread they're being preached to every
[39:41] Sunday so they're leaving them spirits
[39:47] didn't die back to info' them spirits
[39:49] just came over they came over on the
[39:51] Mayflower
[39:54] I shouldn't say that because that's
[39:55] Thanksgiving but they created the
[39:57] Thanksgiving part I made a complete
[40:00] idiot myself one time it's only one time
[40:03] half of my life right I made a complete
[40:05] idiot myself there was a guy from Norway
[40:08] come to our business and he was talking
[40:10] you know it was the day before
[40:11] Thanksgiving and I said oh I see you're

[40:38] Jerry cramp
[40:39] don't last any foreigner about

[40:42] now they may have their things giving
[40:44] day but it ain't same day we have ours
[40:47] okey-dokey
[40:48] just that's just a life lesson I'm not
[40:51] gonna lie more charge rate for this but
[40:52] I'm gonna charge email they said you got
[40:54] plenty of money this is the bread which
[40:56] came down from heaven not as your
[40:58] father's did eat manna and our dad and I
[41:00] swear he's still not dead he that eateth
[41:03] of this bread shall live forever what he
[41:06] was saying is the father is a man and
[41:08] they died you eat of this bread you
[41:10] won't die all right let's go and finish
[41:15] reading in first Corinthians at 11:24
[41:19] and when he had given thanks he brake
[41:21] and said take this take eat this is my
[41:23] body which is broken for you this doing
[41:25] remembrance of me and after the same
[41:27] manner he took the cup when he had
[41:30] supped saying this cup is the New
[41:31] Testament that's why you and I living
[41:34] under a New Testament the Testament of
[41:37] the blood of the what testator because
[41:40] somebody had to die to give you this
[41:42] amen this is this cup is the New
[41:46] Testament in my blood this do ye as oft
[41:47] as you drink it in remembrance of me
[41:50] instituting the communion but now not
[41:52] just the communion to me when you take
[41:54] that communion you've entered to me
[41:56] you've entered from the Old Testament
[41:57] into the New Testament you're honoring
[42:01] the New Testament he said this is the
[42:03] New Testament in my blood this is a New
[42:05] Testament in my flesh when we come up
[42:07] and take communion
[42:08] now we're not see how the Catholic took
[42:10] it to one extreme that it's the literal
[42:13] body it's not the literal My heavens how
[42:16] can you get how do you somebody to
[42:18] believe that that little wafer they turn
[42:20] it into the flesh of Jesus they do it
[42:23] right and they believe it maybe we ought
[42:29] to become believers like that but not
[42:31] believe in that right take eat this is
[42:38] my body which is broken for you this
[42:40] doing remember so you eat eat partake
[42:43] that's our problem we everyone no one
[42:47] listen no one down through the churches
[42:49] has ever been able to eat like we eat no
[42:52] one has ever been able to partake like
[42:54] we partake no one no one has been able
[43:00] to sit in a congregation as you're
[43:02] sitting tonight and it doesn't matter
[43:05] put anybody up here not just me but to
[43:08] listen to something that's going to get
[43:10] us either get us out of the grave or not
[43:17] put us in the grave you win either way
[43:23] you win either way this message is going
[43:26] to get them out of the grave ain't gonna
[43:28] keep them from going to the grave
[43:32] now don't mean the letter the message
[43:34] either the letter killeth but the Spirit
[43:40] give us life all right let's go to
[43:42] revelations 3:15 still trying to recount
[43:46] yeah I just go to Revelation 3:15 just
[43:48] going go and pass that one will cut it
[43:51] short a little bit Revelation 3:15 and
[43:53] then the angel church that allowed to
[43:54] stands right these things that the Amen
[43:56] the faithful and true witness the
[43:57] beginning of the creation of God oh my
[44:01] god being created
[44:08] according to that he's the beginning of
[44:12] the creation of God who is that that's
[44:19] the son of man that's the son of man the
[44:24] beginning of the creation of God when
[44:26] God spoke into a womb without sex
[44:30] without any kind of emotion without any
[44:33] kind of feeling he entered into the
[44:38] natural womb of a woman with a seed not
[44:41] with anything else you understand what
[44:43] I'm saying and created in the womb of
[44:46] Mary created a body for him to live in
[44:53] amen that's the beginning of the
[44:55] creation the God that's the way you
[44:57] wanted it had there not been a fall but
[44:59] in other words genesis 3:15 said I'll
[45:01] put enmity I'll come back and I'll take
[45:05] this thing all the way back to the
[45:09] beginning of the creation of God the way
[45:11] it should have been that's in our church
[45:14] age I know that words are neither cold
[45:17] nor hot skip all that going through we
[45:19] know I don't even like to read it as me
[45:22] as I love I rebuke and chasten be
[45:23] zealous therefore and repent behold I
[45:25] stand at the door of the Laodicean
[45:29] church kalesu he's talking to behold I
[45:34] stand at the door and knock and if any
[45:36] man hear my what in the days of the
[45:39] voice and opened the door I will come in
[45:43] to him and will sup with him and he with
[45:46] me now remember I read you that quote
[45:48] where I I've always thought this but I
[45:51] want to brother branham to be the one
[45:53] that tells you this in the feast of the
[45:55] trumpet number four know that it's the
[45:57] loosening of this ecclesiastical spirit
[46:00] now twenty years later after that war
[46:03] now you know what he's talking about
[46:04] it's not about World War two 1964 is
[46:07] basically 20 years from 1944 that was
[46:09] the second Second World War now 20 years
[46:12] later after that war we see the
[46:14] loosening of the ecclesiastical spirit
[46:16] now he didn't say
[46:19] prosecute
[46:21] demons and religious religious
[46:27] ecclesiastical spirit what under the
[46:31] seventh seal the seventh trumpet to the
[46:33] Jew we'll get into that in the seventh
[46:35] seal look at the moon darkening out what
[46:38] under see it drawing out the son of man
[46:40] being drove from the church he was drove
[46:44] out of the church but he stood at the
[46:48] door not and I didn't read the rest of
[46:52] it to save time but he said you'll sit
[46:54] with me in my throne not on in Bojan in
[47:01] not on if you're on the throne you can
[47:06] be on the throne with the devil but you
[47:09] can't be in Jesus Christ and be the
[47:11] devil
[47:12] ah Satan don't even have a throne God
[47:19] said heavens my throne Earth's my foot's
[47:21] - where's the devil's part
[47:23] he'll get his part those remember
[47:27] brother Ram said hell was what a
[47:28] bottomless pit he had no foundation
[47:30] so Satan's got a house that ain't gonna
[47:32] Alleluia ain't got no foundation but the
[47:37] son of man was drove from the church but
[47:39] thank God we had a prophet to come in
[47:42] the end time and steer us back in the
[47:45] right direction steer us back in the way
[47:47] that we should go amen
[47:50] now let's go to first Thessalonians and
[47:53] everyone we're going to marry to two
[47:55] passages of Scripture together here but
[47:58] I would not have you ignorant brethren
[47:59] concerning them which are asleep
[48:01] all right I would not have you ignorant
[48:03] we now understand there in the sixth
[48:06] dimension when when Paul wrote that I
[48:08] don't think he knew that now he might
[48:12] have went across the curtain of time and
[48:13] he might have done but he never come
[48:15] back and said I went over and I saw
[48:18] these people and I touched him and they
[48:21] called me brother and it's the sixth
[48:25] dimension now brother Branham did that
[48:28] but no one else did I'm not saying he
[48:32] did maybe I said that wrong I'm not
[48:34] saying
[48:34] didn't but he didn't like granny used to
[48:36] say he didn't explain it
[48:38] he didn't splain that like brother Brown
[48:40] explained it brother Brown explained
[48:43] that where he could go over there and
[48:44] touch him people cuz remember brother
[48:46] branham had the same idea that everybody
[48:48] else did floating on a cloud with a
[48:50] heart oh there goes brother Nevel and he
[48:53] said at one time he said I can't shake
[48:55] his hand he said because we had passed
[48:58] through each other oh he lost that
[49:01] revelation didn't he
[49:02] we went across the curtain of time and
[49:04] he said in women hug me and he said they
[49:06] were women you understand what I'm
[49:08] saying but there was no feeling and no
[49:12] emotion as it was in this dimension well
[49:17] I would not have you ignorant brethren
[49:18] that's what I'm telling you we are not
[49:20] ignorant of what's going on we know
[49:24] we've been told for now fifty or sixty
[49:27] years we've been told how it's going to
[49:30] happen but I wouldn't have you ignor
[49:32] brethren concerning them with your sleep
[49:34] thank you Paul then what you're asleep
[49:37] that you sorrow not you know the only
[49:40] thing we sorrow for is just separation a
[49:43] part of somebody's in your life and now
[49:47] they're gone that's the human part but
[49:55] if they're born again dear Jesus they
[50:00] ain't got to go to work thank God pay no
[50:02] taxes they ain't got to get up in the
[50:04] morning and worry about going the
[50:07] bathroom worry about going this and
[50:08] going to the doctor Lane a doctor in the
[50:10] sixth dimension unless he was born again
[50:12] and died and he's in it and he's out of
[50:14] a job once he crossed an Ice Age
[50:18] dimension he's out of a job
[50:20] Rock brother they know doctors in heaven
[50:24] don't need them listen but there are
[50:32] some good doctors I believe it'll be in
[50:33] heaven
[50:33] I believe that
[50:39] did you know brother Brown talks about
[50:41] brother Sam Madera that Sam Adair I
[50:43] don't know if he ever got born again but
[50:44] he's sure sure like the guy you know and
[50:46] the guy really helped brother brown them
[50:47] and he helped him you know he'd be given
[50:49] eternal life I believe anyway for we
[50:51] believe that Jesus died and rose again
[50:53] even so them also which sleep in Jesus
[50:57] will God bring with him so you got to be
[51:01] asleep in Christ right for this we say
[51:04] unto you by the word of the Lord that we
[51:07] which are alive and remain thank God we
[51:10] are a we at this moment we are a we we
[51:14] which are alive and remain unto the
[51:17] coming of the Lord shall not prevent
[51:19] them which are asleep for the Lord
[51:24] Himself where is he he is sent a second
[51:31] person and sent a third person or a pope
[51:33] or a priest or king he came himself for
[51:38] the Lord himself shall descend from
[51:39] heaven with a shout hey pay attention
[51:44] the voice of the Archangel you're
[51:47] hearing it now
[51:50] and I'm not saying me I'm saying you're
[51:52] hearing that voice now because the voice
[51:56] is in the bride you're hearing it right
[51:59] now and the Trump of God that's what
[52:02] we're waiting on because I'm gonna read
[52:04] it to you in just a minute cause it
[52:05] comes back to that Trump over in
[52:08] Corinthians so we're going to marry
[52:10] these two together not all right mm-hmm
[52:13] then no for the Lord himself shall
[52:16] descend from heaven with a shout boys
[52:18] the Archangel Trump of God and the dead
[52:20] in Christ shall rise first before we get
[52:24] a change in our mortal human dying
[52:30] bodies there's going to come a voice a
[52:33] revelation that's going to come from
[52:35] inside and it's not going to matter
[52:38] what's on the outside that's our problem
[52:41] this is all circumstance I'm gonna do
[52:46] what God said
[52:48] and the dead in Christ shall rise first
[52:51] then we which are alive and remain shall
[52:55] be caught up together with them in the
[52:58] clouds to meet the lord in the air and
[53:00] so she ever be with the Lord
[53:02] wherefore comfort one another with these
[53:05] words you know what man has comforted
[53:06] their self all through two thousand ages
[53:10] there's going to be a resurrection one
[53:13] day there's going to be a resurrection
[53:15] one day we're going to see our loved
[53:17] ones again one day but they were never
[53:19] told how they were never told how cuz
[53:25] only the Son of Man knows how only the
[53:32] son of man knows how and when he come
[53:34] back in the end time through a little
[53:37] prophet named William Branham he give us
[53:40] that revelation he told us the reality
[53:43] of what is on that side what's on this
[53:46] side and how to get the two sides
[53:48] together we've just got to keep going
[53:50] and going and going and going look at
[53:53] number 5 on the rapture message brother
[53:56] Branham said the word rapture in the
[53:59] Bible it's not even used at all we just
[54:02] put that word there the Bible says
[54:05] caught up being caught up now I'm going
[54:10] to skip this for time because just
[54:12] finish at the end of that semester call
[54:15] me in now I want you to notice a great
[54:21] thing taking place there's three things
[54:23] that happens before the Lord appeared
[54:25] now we just went through them a shout a
[54:27] voice and the same time it's like three
[54:29] or four pages of reading so let's just
[54:31] skip on through that remember a shout a
[54:33] voice and a trumpet now we we've been
[54:35] taught it's the message so the shout is
[54:41] the message but I want you to understand
[54:45] something that's not all of it the
[54:49] message come then there had to be a
[54:52] voice behind that message and then the
[55:00] Trump of God shall sound
[55:02] the dead in Christ shall rise first but
[55:04] now let's go let's go to first
[55:07] Corinthians skip 4 time mm-hmm
[55:09] keep going where it says first
[55:11] Corinthians goes remember here we are
[55:15] let's go through this real quick
[55:17] and then we'll be finished because to me
[55:19] this puts the punctuation mark Paul is
[55:25] answering the question he says so also
[55:27] is the resurrection of the Dead
[55:29] it is sown in corruption it is raised in
[55:33] incorruption that's why we have to put
[55:35] them into the ground because you have to
[55:37] put the seed back in the ground now the
[55:39] person's not in there the body's there
[55:42] but that body is connected with that
[55:44] person that's why I don't understand why
[55:47] people think we're just gonna get this
[55:48] all-new body why do you need that
[55:53] scripture then it is sown in current
[55:57] what not your soul your soul is not
[56:00] corrupt if you're born again that's
[56:03] talking about your body but it is raised
[56:06] oh no by the way that's not raised we
[56:09] just going to get another one that one's
[56:10] just going just completely right away
[56:12] now that's what most people believe in
[56:14] this message that is not true that is a
[56:17] lie according to the Bible it's a lie
[56:23] that would be real easy for God to just
[56:26] throw this one away and give us a brand
[56:29] new one but what a great miracle would
[56:31] be that the one that I was walking
[56:33] around in for 58 years one day changes
[56:39] which is the greater
[56:41] I think that's greater that's a greater
[56:44] mystery or that to me that is the
[56:46] mystery because I'll tell you what
[56:48] Paul's gonna tell us what the mystery is
[56:50] it is sown in dishonor what we came here
[56:54] by safe
[56:55] it was sown in dishonor but it was
[56:59] raised in glory it is sown in weakness
[57:03] obviously it is raised in power it is
[57:07] sown a natural body it is raised a
[57:10] spiritual body there is a natural body
[57:13] and there's a spiritual
[57:16] but they're connected you're not gonna
[57:21] raise you're not going to raise in
[57:23] somebody else's body
[57:25] God give you that body and thought
[57:27] enough of it to resurrect it he taught
[57:31] enough of his own body to do that how in
[57:33] the world is Jesus going to raise in his
[57:35] own body and then you're going to get
[57:36] something else I brother boy the greater
[57:43] miracle is right here that he can take
[57:46] this thing and change it and I'll live
[57:52] in it for an eternity I'm losing my
[57:55] voice in a minute there's a natural body
[57:57] and there's a spiritual body so it is
[57:59] written the first man Adam was made a
[58:02] living soul the last man Adam didn't
[58:06] need to be made a living soul he was a
[58:10] living soul he was the only living soul
[58:14] because Adam is somewhere in this earth
[58:18] his body dead body now he souls over in
[58:23] another dimension we know that the first
[58:29] man Adam was made a living soul the last
[58:31] man Adam was made a quickening spirit
[58:34] because when Christ came out of that
[58:39] dimension he was in and he stepped into
[58:43] that body that was laying over there in
[58:46] Jerusalem that had been beat to a pulp
[58:49] beard had been pulled out stripes all
[58:53] those things that happened to that body
[58:55] when that spirit quickened that body it
[59:00] changed it to whatever that body the
[59:03] Alpha new body looked like same way with
[59:06] me and you that's why we got the people
[59:08] downstairs that's when we got them at 18
[59:10] to 20 years old that's the next thing
[59:12] you're gonna see that's what they're
[59:13] going to look like why because we
[59:16] already planted it in corruption but God
[59:19] when that quickening spirit that they
[59:22] live here on earth with eternal life in
[59:25] their soul when that thing comes back
[59:27] into the
[59:28] body it's going to change that thing
[59:32] howbeit that was not first which is
[59:35] spiritual but that which is natural why
[59:37] because they committed I mean they
[59:39] committed the act and afterward that
[59:41] which is spiritual the first man is of
[59:43] the earth earthy the second man is the
[59:47] Lord from heaven as is the earthy such
[59:52] are they also that are earthy that's us
[59:55] and as is the heavenly such also are
[1:00:01] they that are heavenly as we have borne
[1:00:03] the image of the earthy listen this is
[1:00:07] the last time you're gonna see this guy
[1:00:09] in this condition and I prayed that if
[1:00:14] I'm not saying that to be you know
[1:00:17] prophesied but this guy right here in
[1:00:20] other words what I'm saying is we have
[1:00:22] borne the image of what our parents
[1:00:24] brought here but somehow in some way God
[1:00:31] made it look just like your theophany
[1:00:35] you ever thought of that
[1:00:37] brother Brown said he bred this one
[1:00:39] hello brother I'm said this he bred this
[1:00:42] one to this one this one to this one and
[1:00:44] this one to get to get you there don't
[1:00:48] tell me you're not elected to be ejected
[1:00:53] his brother and he says as we are but we
[1:00:56] have borne the image of the earthy we
[1:00:59] shall also bear the image of the
[1:01:01] heavenly now this I say brethren that
[1:01:05] flesh and blood cannot inherit the
[1:01:06] kingdom of God this flesh and this blood
[1:01:09] cannot inherit the Kitt's not an
[1:01:10] inheritance it will become an
[1:01:13] inheritance remember Jesus got
[1:01:16] inheritance you not get the inheritance
[1:01:18] in this now this I say brother flesh and
[1:01:24] blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God
[1:01:26] neither does corruption inherit
[1:01:28] incorruption they're separated they're
[1:01:33] either separated by death or by what we
[1:01:36] going to get a body change with behold
[1:01:41] I like something struck Paul behold
[1:01:49] behold ah I looked up that word because
[1:01:53] it looks kind of weird that doesn't say
[1:01:56] show look at it don't look at me that
[1:02:01] says shoe punch Senor lo Strong's
[1:02:06] Concordance it'll tell you what that
[1:02:07] means
[1:02:10] behold in other words I give or I open
[1:02:16] up a mystery
[1:02:20] behold I open to you a mystery we shall
[1:02:25] not all sleep but we shall all be
[1:02:29] changed in a moment in the twinkling of
[1:02:34] an eye everybody's made that whatever
[1:02:36] you want to but if you look up the word
[1:02:38] twinkling it's an instant and that I
[1:02:43] doesn't mean this I understanding in an
[1:02:50] instant that you understand what's going
[1:02:52] on hello in an instant when you
[1:02:57] understand what's going on at the last
[1:02:59] Trump
[1:03:01] now watch at the last Trump for the
[1:03:07] trumpet shall sound that's two things
[1:03:12] brother that preached on this a long
[1:03:14] time ago I wrote in my Bible it says at
[1:03:22] the last Trump message for the trumpet
[1:03:27] shall sound through you you are the
[1:03:32] trumpet the Trump's gonna sound it's
[1:03:35] already sounded it's the message the
[1:03:38] Trump has sounded
[1:03:39] but the trumpet shall sound you and I
[1:03:44] with this message and the dead shall be
[1:03:49] raised incorruptible
[1:03:51] and we shall be changed for this
[1:03:55] corruptible must I love that word must
[1:03:58] put on incorruption and this mortal must
[1:04:01] put on immortality so when this
[1:04:04] corruptible shall have put on
[1:04:06] incorruption and this mortal shall put
[1:04:08] on immortality then shall be brought to
[1:04:11] pass the saying that is written death is
[1:04:13] what Adam and Eve got in trouble for
[1:04:20] eaten the wrong fruit they swallowed the
[1:04:27] wrong fruit somebody is going to swallow
[1:04:31] the right fruit death is swallowed up in
[1:04:35] life Oh death where is your sting grave
[1:04:38] where is your victory all right let me
[1:04:40] read this quote we'll be done brother
[1:04:44] Brown said God doesn't call anyway 724
[1:04:47] 1963 for the trumpet of God shall sound
[1:04:54] and those who are asleep or resting
[1:04:57] shall wake up first take on immortality
[1:05:03] first by what the trumpet sounds listen
[1:05:10] they're not just going to automatically
[1:05:12] walk in front of us there's got
[1:05:13] something happen
[1:05:15] there's got something happened but it's
[1:05:18] got to happen on this side because death
[1:05:22] still reigns over here that's why they
[1:05:25] won't come here I mean please don't take
[1:05:31] me out of an eternal place and put me
[1:05:33] where I was weird after that but if I
[1:05:37] know if I know for a fact that those
[1:05:40] people that are standing in this
[1:05:42] dimension has destroyed death I'm gonna
[1:05:47] come back and see them with no
[1:05:51] reservation whoops
[1:05:55] uh how you get this name back all right
[1:06:00] here we go
[1:06:04] then we which are alive at today
[1:06:06] musicians yokomo at that time after they
