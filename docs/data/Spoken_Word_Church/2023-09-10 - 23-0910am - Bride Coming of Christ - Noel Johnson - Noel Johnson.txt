[Music] I want to greet you all in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and it's my privilege to be here amongst you I'm not much unpreliminaries um if you're standing turn to Hebrews the 10th chapter and read verses 5 through 10. [Music] and my wife and I had been we've been in we've been going to end you for the last 17 years normally when we go we spend uh minimum of a month and a half sometimes as long as two months and then when we're we're always glad to get home so Hebrews the 10th chapter starting at verse 5. it says wherefore when he cometh into the world he says sacrifice and offerings thou what is not but a body hast thou prepared me and burn offerings and sacrifices of our sins thou Hast no pleasure then said I lo I come in the volume of the book that is written of me to do thy will o God and let's pray our most gracious and loving Heavenly Father it is our privilege to gather ourselves together in your presence around your word and then Lord to hear what you'd have for us this morning it's Fallen my lot to stand before the purchase of your blood but Lord I want you to be you speaking and not me you placed a thought on My Heart Lord but it's going to take you to be able to express it and make it so that the people can understand so Lord we're asking for your for your sovereignty we're asking for your presence and anointing the Lord we all may in your presence be able to enjoy your presence and enjoy your word for I ask it in Jesus Christ's name amen you can be seated it's interesting in Hebrews it talks about therefore when he cometh into the world you say a sacrifice and offering thou what is not but a body hast thou prepared me and when I was thinking about that we have to realize that we are God has created another body and we are that body God from the beginning of the world he knew who you were he knew the color of your hair he knew everything everything there is to know about you but what he has done he has taken his seed and placed it in you and the seed that he has placed in you is himself I mean the seed we have is the seed of God well what can the seed of God produce if it produces the life of the seed then the only thing we can produce is God in Jesus Christ when he was born he was God he was he he he was born the Son of God he God bypassed the the fleshly nature I mean he in any way he placed a seed within Mary he calls that seed to grow and that seed when they've matured all of a sudden it came forth when it was born but he when he was came forth he was the son of God but see this relates to us in so many different ways brother Branham in the rising of the son he makes a statement he says in the bride coming of Christ coming out of the church they'll have to be a sheave waved again in the last day and when I was looking at that in the bride coming of Christ it's talking about Jesus Christ himself so coming in Bride form until the bride becomes the literal manifestation of him it's not about us it's about him it's not what we do for God it's what we allowed him to do through us but we have to learn to yield ourselves we have to recognize Who We Are we've had we've had the message God through the God sent a prophet unto us in this generation and and he gone through that Prophet was trying to tell the bride this is who you are yes you are not just Sinners saved by grace you are Sons and Daughters of God that have been fully restored to your rightful position with God you're coming to the place where you have free access to God you are his child brother Branham in one place he says God would breath to rather listen to his child than he would the Angels when we go to our father if we had servants if we had a business and we had people working for us and they came with suggestions that's one thing but when all of a sudden they asked the son I go to my father hey Dad do you think we should do it this way or that way all he's willing to listen to me because I'm his son well it's come down to the place now where God's willing to listen to us but actually it's come to the place now where actually what we are supposed to be doing is listening to him we are supposed to be led by him we are supposed to be guided by him in every aspect this is Jesus Christ had to follow the leadership of the god that dwelt inside of him we have to learn how to follow the leadership of God in our lives it could be coming to the place where there is no difference here that as God directed Jesus Christ he now must direct us because now we are this body of Jesus Christ we are the we are the body of God upon the face of this Earth and that's what God sent the prophet to tell us he began to tell us brother Bannerman brother Branham in many places he says you know it's not about me it's not about what I do but it's a but it's because I allow the god that is inside of me to come and express himself through me and the words that he began to express especially after the seals he began to try and tell the bride this is who you are you are not going to be the sons of God you are the sons of God when you were born you were Sons and Daughters of God but you had to come into this you had you had to be born in flesh so that you could develop a character but when you were born you were Sons and Daughters of God because God seed was in you your parents brought forth the body you live in but God had placed his seed in you from the from the foundations of the world and what he is now he's trying to take that seed that he has placed in you and bring that seed into full manifestation to full expression and on that seed that was placed in you comes into full manifestation expression you will be the manifestation of God but we have Jesus Christ did only what the father showed him to do and that's where the bride now has to come God sent the prophet and the prophet delivered the message that he that God intended for him to deliver to us he came to tell us that this is who you are it's like when I was raised in the Baptist Church I was a sinner saved by grace the emphasis was on sinner I will always be a sinner well I still am a sinner saved by grace but this message taught me something which is vastly superior to that he said you were a Son of God when you were born you were a Son of God and now you've been restored to your rightful position as as a Son of God but now we have to come into the position where we actually will accept what God says that we are to what brother Brown says another place he says we look we live way below our privileges because as Sons and Daughters of God we have control over Satan we don't have to put up with him but I mean as a kind of a funny way of expressing my wife when they when I mean she had had a cough and she was coughing and coughing and was keeping me awake well I like my sleep and so she was nice enough she went to the front room and she laid on the recliner and she was you know she was trying to let me sleep well her coughing was still keeping me away so what I do I went into where she was at and I said Satan I'm tired of you being here I'm tired of you keeping me awake you have to leave because now I'm telling you get out and that's exactly what I told him she quit coughing I got to go to strip but go to bed and go back to sleep but it was I have the authority I have the authority by virtue of who I am because I am a Son of God I have authority because Jesus has given me that Authority I have the authority to take Satan and tell him to leave and when I command him to leave he has no choice not because of who I am but because of what I represent I am a Son of God I know that I am a Son of God and therefore because I know I am a Son of God I can exercise The Authority as a son and Satan has to Satan doesn't have to listen to me he has to listen to the one who has called me he has to listen to the Jesus Christ that dwells inside of me and when that Jesus Christ inside of me anoints his word that I speak that's no longer me speaking it's God speaking through me and Satan has to obey that he has to obey that and this comes down to all of us Satan has to obey us because of who we are because we are the seed of God we are the God's representation upon the face of this Earth we talk about it it talks about it it says a body has now prepared me well that relates to us because God we are the body that God now now resides in I mean you said where is God I'm looking at him I'm looking at the body of God himself because God dwells in you when you were born you were Sons and Daughters of God you had to come through you had you were born in flesh that gives us Natures that we continuously fight but because but later on we meet we through the gospel we responded to the gospel when the message came across our path where he responded to that but until you receive the Holy Spirit you're not born again but once you receive the Holy Spirit then you all of a sudden then you are born into the place where now you are the sons and daughters of God up until that point you you can fumble around and do what you want to but once God comes and lives inside of you once that new birth takes place in you there has to be a change in your life if there's no change there's no conversion but once there's a conversion once Jesus Christ comes inside of you in the Holy Spirit and all of a sudden begins to live his life out through you that becomes the difference we go and we begin to look at other bodies that God dwelt in we begin to look at Moses Moses was born for a specific purpose he was to be the deliverer of the children of Israel out of Egypt he didn't like his job he tried to refuse it once but you know God doesn't have plan B he called he chose and says you're going to do it he tried to talk his way out of him God says no you're going to do it anyway because I've ordered you to do that we look at the Prophet Jeremiah Jeremiah tells God he says you lied to me I didn't realize what I was going to have to live through because of my calling and Jeremiah tried to quit but all of a sudden he says there's something inside of my body there there's a word burning within me he says I can't do anything else but I happen to Proclaim what God had given to him well where are we at in this plan we are his body God placed his seed in you because that seed was placed in you he elected that seed he elected that seed to become what God intended for it to be and and this this now here here again it begins to apply unto us we have to be we have to start accepting Who We Are I mean I I find a lot of people in churches and probably probably not here but they hear they go in ahead and listen to The Prophet's message and oh yeah that was wonderful we pick out little things we we agree with here and we agree with there but we never apply it we never come down to the place we are accepting what God said we are once you begin to accept what you what God said that you are that changes thing because then all of a sudden then you realize you have the power and the authority over Satan you have the power and authority over sickness you have the power and authority over every over all the works of darkness but until you accept that you will never be able to manifest that until you begin to realize no I am a Son of God I am the body that God dwells in and because God dwells in me and if I can yield to the spirit of God that dwells in me I can I can command Satan in in in and Satan has to obey that because it's it's no longer me but it's him when we look at in in Isaiah it says it says unto us a child is born unto us the son is given the government shall be upon his shoulder his name Shall be Called wonderful counselor the Mighty God the Everlasting father the Prince of Peace when Jesus Christ was born he was the son of God you know it's interesting in Jesus Christ within Jesus Christ he bypassed the fleshly birth okay the release it wasn't the relationship between God and Mary okay but so God placed within Mary a seed and that scene Mary had to carry that seed Mary had to carry that save until it comes would come to maturity until that seed could actually come into manifestation be born well see all of a sudden that's that's the same thing that happened down through the church ages God planted his Satan in the church on the day of Pentecost but what was the function of the church the church was to be the carrier of that life and since it was a carrier of that life the the church protected that that seed until until they could have come and reached maturity we're in the last age we're in the last days that seed that was planted on Pentecost must come to maturity it must come into full manifestation and that's where we're at in the bride coming of Jesus Christ Jesus Christ will soon come and live within the bride until it's no longer her but it's God living his life through her as God dwelts in Jesus Christ and expressed himself through Jesus Christ now he's going to come and he's going to express through us the bride the same thing it is he expressed through Jesus Christ and Hebrews and uh one it says in these half in these last days spoken unto us by his son who hath appointed air of All Things by whom he made all by whom he made the world Jesus Christ was in the logos form when he began to speak God had God had to go from a spirit form into some physical form and while in that physical form the process of creation began but he comes down and it comes on later on it says who being the brightness of his glory and the express image of his person and upholding All Things by his power when he invite so when he had by himself our sins he sat down with the right hand but Jesus Christ was the express image he was an exact duplication of what God is but see now he God has come into a new body that's us we are to become that expressed image we are to become that full manifestation of God I mean this is this is a big step I mean especially mentally speaking when you when you begin to claim that you are a son of God when you begin to recognize that you are a son you are a manifestation of God himself I mean we look at ourselves and says yeah I don't think so I mean there are days that um yeah I have my bad hair day so I still have a few but we come to the place where we have to begin to realize it's not about us it's about him Jesus Christ did only what the father showed him to do wherever he went whatever he did it was under the direct Authority and command of the god that dwelt in him God but brother Brown says in the scriptures he said he said he says Jesus Christ prayed often because he wanted to know what God's will is one of the time he told the disciples we have to go by way of Samaria Samaria was not in the direct route to where they were thinking they were going but God directed him to go there because there was a seed there that had to be ministered unto why do we go the places we go why are we directed by the spirits of the sum of the places we go because God has a seed someplace and God has wanted to express himself to those to the the people that are around you you know it's um brother Branham says because my sons and daughters of God he says we can create a world and go live on it well this universe couldn't couldn't tolerate ten thousand worlds um but he says we can create an atmosphere brother Branham one day he was his wife the family was all upset and everything was going on and so brother Brown just quietly he went over he put his hands upon his wife and he prayed silently for her he prayed for God's spirits to come now he created an atmosphere and slowly but surely he says all the the arguments with the kids all of that went by the wayside and all of a sudden I mean everything just settled down but see wherever we go we can create an atmosphere I don't like the atmosphere outside of the church I don't like Walmart I don't like going shopping I don't like a whole bunch of other things so what I try and do is I try and create an atmosphere so whenever I go to I try to be kind I try to be gentle I try to say good words I mean when you go to check out in your in a grocery store they're they're supposed to say Hi how are you it's probably just an automatic thing and so you respond back I'm doing great how are you doing and that kind of takes them back sometime I'm inviting them into my world I'm inviting them to experience what I experience because wherever I go I I try and have Jesus Christ I try and create an atmosphere where there's love and joy and peace and long suffering and gentleness and patience and meeting and so whenever I talk unto them I'm inviting them into my world and if they will respond to my world then we can draw them into the into into Jesus Christ and we can draw them into Jesus Christ if there's a seed there they will respond to that and all of a sudden then then they will become become an experience what we are Jesus Christ was every bit human brother Branham says he was all man and he was all God it talks about in in Hebrews he says who in the days of his flesh when he'd offered up prayers and supplications strong crying and tears unto him that was able to save from him death and that he heard he he was heard in that he feared uh though he were a son he had learned he obedience by the things that he suffered so his flesh had a different desire his flesh did not want to go to the Cross his flesh did not want to hang on the tree he knew what was waiting for him and that's why he prayed in the garden but he had to take his will the will of his flesh and submitted unto the will of the father but see sometimes this is where we have to come we do not necessarily want to go where God is directing our lives but if God is directing Our Lives it's not about us fulfilling our will and our desire knows about us fulfilling the desire and the will of God why do we go to India because that's where God directed me this last year if we went to India it was a very difficult trip for us I didn't I really in reality I didn't want to go but all of a sudden God put things in our in our pathway I mean the Visas hadn't expired so we had to get new though that went through no problem and then the finances came in well that was and so I figured well okay Lord whether I want to or not I'm going to India so we went there we spent a little over six weeks first three weeks wasn't too bad and then I got food poisoning so for the last two three weeks really I was very very sick then my wife came down with the flu that put her in bed for a week but we went when we went there I I accomplished what I believe God sent me to accomplish but it was not an easy trip this time and I was kind of fearful it was but anyway but here again it's taking my will and submitting into his will so Lord you have directed you have guided obviously you have a reason for me going and so there so therefore we win in other ministers I know they go different places and they have to minister a certain things but it's learning to take our will and submit it to the will of the father that dwells in us because God has a reason for that we know that Jesus Christ he had to be born of the lineage of David otherwise he wouldn't be able to sit on the throne of David in the Millennium he had to also be he had to be whipped for the purchase of our of our healing he had to he had he had to be born in flesh so that he could become arkansmen Redeemer and so all of these things Jesus Christ had to fulfill by his birth and and and then by his by his death and Resurrection when Jesus Christ came he he had a commission he mentions that he quoted from Isaiah but he said the spirit of the Lord is upon me because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor he has sent me to heal the brokenhearted to preached Deliverance of the captives the recovering of sight to the blind you so the Liberty them that are bruised and decreased acceptable year of the Lord John the Baptist was expecting the king they were and the disciples were expecting the king they were expecting him to go to sit upon the throne of David and to rule and Reign and get rid of all and get rid of all the Romans that was not for that time that time he had to come and redeem when he comes back this time no he's coming back in power and that's when he's going to set up the kingdom and that's when we will rule and reign with him for over a thousand years but when John the Baptist was in prison he sent some of his disciples and says are you the one that we're supposed to be looking for because you're not doing what we expecting you to do and so what did Jesus Christ do he healed the sick and he raised the dead and he performed different Miracles and he said now you go and show John what what I've done because I have come to fulfill that which which is but the scriptures has spoken to me that I was to fulfill but brother Branham keeps talking about the same commission that Jesus Christ had that is our commission it hasn't changed we are to be the continuation of the ministry of Jesus Christ so what are we supposed to be doing we're supposed to be going recovering of sight to the Blind and healing people and preaching cap Deliverance to capture we are supposed to presenting unto them the gospel and bringing them into the fellowship of Jesus Christ that is our commission it's interesting that Jesus Christ took it to the disciples and he gave them the authority he gave them the authority to go ahead and and to do the things that that God was doing through him and because he gave them the authority then they could then they could go about and they could do what the based upon the authority that that that they now possessed Charlie Jesus Christ before he was death he before he he before his crucifixion he talks in John the 17th chapter and and he talks about us here he says neither I pray I for these alone but for them also which Shall Believe on me through their word uh that they may be one as thou father art in me and I in thee that there may also be one in us that the world may believe that thou has sent me and the glory which thou gave us me I have given them that they may be one even as we are one i in them and thou and me that they may be made perfect in one through the whole through the baptism of the Holy Spirit that is when this that is when this um this Unity that is what that where this Oneness can take place because Jesus Christ in the Jesus Christ when he was born he was the son of God it wasn't until until John baptized him in the River Jordan that all of a sudden the spirit of God Came Upon him and that's when Jesus Christ literally became that's when Jesus Christ literally became one with the father because then all the fullness of the godhead bodily dwelt in Jesus Christ well in the disciples yeah when they when you look at them I mean they were they were arguing and bickering and fighting who is going to be the greatest and who's going to sit on his right hand on the left hand and all these other types of stuff and this is not what God had in mind it wasn't an Earthly Kingdom that that they it wasn't an earth a kingdom that God was Desiring for them it was a spiritual Kingdom that all of a sudden they had to become into they had to become in unity with God and so until they received the Holy Spirit there was no way for Unity to ever exist but here again and when he comes down we relate that to us when you were born you were Sons and Daughters of God when you were born and God God ordained you from before the foundation of the world to be his child but until you receive the holy spirit this Unity this Oneness he talks about here was not was not a possibility but once all of a sudden God comes and begins to dwell in you then there's Unity that he talks about here now now this is a possibility but see now is the time for this possibility to become a reality now is the time for us to be able to manifest who we are because until we accept this fact until we understand the unity that God was wanting to hear until we accept this fact we will never be able to accomplish what God has ordained for us to be in this day and the bride coming of Jesus Christ Jesus Christ will so come and live within his body the bride until literally the bride will become the full expression of him this was a seed like I said there was there was planted on the day of Pentecost that seed has to come to full maturity now is the time for that the denominational systems have all pulled away now it's time for the bride to come forth now it's time for the bride to come into full manifestation but we draw back from this we draw back from this because in order for this to take place there has to be a total surrender from us to God there has to be a total where where all of a sudden Jesus Christ or God gains the preeminence in each and every one of us because only when he has the preeminence can he manifest himself through us I mean within me there's two spirits that's the one I was born with and the spirit of God they are not always compatible My Flesh has its own desires I mean you look at brother you look at Paul I mean he wrote a lot of the New Testament and what did he have to do that Paul was Paul I mean you look at his letters you look at Peter you look at his letters you look at James you look at his letter the their personality enters into everything that we do brother Branham was a man he also had his personality he expressed it through the things that he said and and the different actions that he has but we have to come to the place where we're willing to take ourselves and so submit it unto God until it's no longer I who live but now God living his life through me but to do that it takes for total preeminence he has to have the total control and only as I'm willing to yield myself to the spirit of God that is in me does he have the control to do what he's Desiring to do through me it's not about what I it's not about what I do for God no it's about what I allow him to do through me we find this in Jesus Christ I do only what the father shows me to do he didn't do his own thing he says I didn't heal Jesus Christ never healed the sick he never raised the dead he never performed any Miracle it was the god in him that did those things brother Bradham when you begin to go down you begin to look at his life he says I was just standing there when God came down I was just standing there in the river and river baptizing when all of a sudden God came down when I'm at the platform he says that's not me speaking that's God speaking through me because he was able to yield himself into the spirit of God that dwelt in him and because he could yield himself to the spirit of God that was in him that's why God could use his voice to speak brother Brown how often he says you know I have to listen to the tape to find out what I said because all I did was yield myself to God and God began to speak through me and he bypassed my mental faculties and everything else and God just began to do what he wanted to do through him but see now this is where we have to come it didn't stop with the prophet it did not stop by when when brother Branham died God did not die with him no it took a there was a transformation of the ministry all of a sudden the ministry began to change when we when you look at Revelations 10 um Revelation San Juan the book's open the mighty Angel Care had that book that book was open who is it open to is open to the bride we come down Revelation and then then there was the Thunders that had that was done and brother Bradham gotten through the prophet began to reveal unto us the secret that was contained in those Thunders the book The Seals had been broken and and goes down to Revelation 10 7 the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God was going to be finished we are that mystery We Are The Mystery of the manifestation of God upon the face of this Earth and then and then and then we look at when when brother when God had fulfilled his ministry through the prophet then then all of a sudden we go down to Revelations 10 8. John eat the book John you eat the book because now you have to become one with that word because now the bride has a Ministry there's something that we have to fulfill we're looking at the manifestation of the sons of God we're we're looking at the time of the Rapture we're looking at the time of our adoption we're looking at the time of the changing of providing all this other wonderful things but we have to come into our position we have to eat the book we have to become we we have to come to the place where it's no longer I who live and now it's God himself living his life through me this is where we as the bride have to rise to that level but we have to die to ourselves in order for that to take it to take place in Philippians 2. starting at verse 5. let this mind or this mindset be in you which was also in Christ Jesus who being in the form the expressed image of God thought not robbery to claim equality with God but he made himself of no reputation he acted he acted not just like all the just like a common man and he took upon him the form of a servant and he was made in the likeness of man and being fashioned like that he becumbled himself to become obedient to the death on the cross well this is the mindset that Jesus Christ had he knew who he was amen he knew he was the son of God he knew he was God incarnate in flesh and because he was God incarnate in flesh all the power of God was he had access to it he could take the fishes and Loaves and feed multitude he could speak to the storm the storm would cease he he could he could raise the dead he could do all these wonderful things but he never did any of those those things without the authorization from his father everybody okay so where does God dwell now dwells in US we need the same mindset we have to be willing to acknowledge we are the sons and daughters of God we have to be willing to acknowledge God dwells in me but we also now we have to realize that with the power of God that dwells in US but God is the one who's supposed to be operating that power God is the one who is supposed to be operating the gifts that he has placed in US brother brought him in his early Ministry he will go out and he said he had the prayer lines oh yeah bring the hard cases bring the the the Blind and the lame and all this other types of stuff the angel said don't do that brother Bradham didn't listen it went on for a couple of services and finally God just backed off he says you think you can do it go for it he had a prayer line and the first one came up and and it the person wasn't healed second one came up and the same I think the third one was a child and brother Brandon realized God's not in this and all of a sudden he went and he had to repent of that and the angel said God has placed a gift in you for God to operate not for you to operate when you take that gift and give it over unto God then God will operate it through you but it's not for you to operate it and so as ministers we have to learn the fact God is placed within us a gift but we have to take that gift and give it to God and so we ask God he says you anointed you you put the words together you control the thoughts of our mind so that what we're saying is not what we want to say but but it's because it's something you want to express and we have to take our gifts and turn it over unto God so that God can operate it through us brother around him in another place the angel talked talked brother random is questioning the spoken word and the angel began to talk to him he says he says who is that speaking when all you run to the discernment oh he says no that's God speaking he says what happens when you stand his Minister and all of a sudden another thought comes into your mind and you follow that thought who's that well that's God speaking so when a minister gets up and he begins to minister it's no longer the minister speaking it's God guiding the thought so that those thoughts which are expressed are hiccard God's thoughts and if you can receive it as God's thoughts it will mean a whole lot more than you do well it was a good service yeah the preacher preached a nice sermon today no it has to go beyond all of that it has to come to the reality no it's God speaking through the ministry unto you so he so that when sometimes ministers get up there and they they wander all over everywhere because there's different needs within the congregation and God is trying to minister into every member of the body of Jesus Christ and if we can accept it as that all of a sudden then you can receive it as the word of God it should give you the strength it should give you the encouragement that you need the brightest is to be the continuation to the ministry of Jesus Christ God has taken in place a seed within us like brother Brian he talks about it in one place where it talks about a seed God placed within Mary a seed that seed that she had to nurture that seed until the time that that seeds could come into manifestation well the church has watched over the seeds it was planned on Pentecost and so that seed could come into full manifestation well that seed has to come into full expression in US this is the bright coming of Jesus Christ this is where Christ who comes and lives within his bride until it's no longer us living but it's Christ Living his life through us and you think oh this is going to be something super and spiritual well sometimes yes sometimes no because our personality enters into everything we do I mean Paul was Paul Jared the Branham with brother Branham he still liked the Hun he still liked the fish he still like to do this that and the other thing but he was willing to take himself and yield himself over to the spirit of God that dwelt in him but see now it comes down unto us we have to be willing to yield ourselves unto the spirit of God that dwells in in US and the patma's vision brother Brown he makes some statements he said this morning was more of a sermon time placing the foundation upon the deity of the revelation God being revealed in Christ how many believes it God was revealed in Christ Jehovah revealed in Christ now where is God to be revealed in his church with his people in us the same spirit will be the same works the same manifestation and that's what most people focus on but he says the Same Love the same forgiveness the same long-suffering and gentleness and patience and peace and mercy all that was in Christ is now in the church remember keep this in mind all that God was important to Christ and he was the fullness of the godhead bodily and all that Christ was he has poured into the church God above us God With Us and now God in us but we have to have we have to manifest the same character power without character is satanic you don't believe that look at our government but we're different than that because we don't know how to operate the gift that God has placed in us until we have the character of Jesus Christ and only with that character will we operate at the way God intended for it to be operated brother random in Christ the mystery he said you know that God had God wanted to accomplish three things first to accept Express himself completely which was God in Christ and but Christ that Christ gave God the total preeminence in in his life he's second to have the preeminence by this in his church which is his which is his body the bride and so God could have the preeminence to express himself through them but it takes the preeminence preeminence means total control when I'm driving I have I take the preeminence now it has these other little things on it now it'll control the speed and it'll control the steering when I get in a storm I turn off the Speed and I turn off the the steering because I want the control because I don't know what's coming right but see now all of a sudden I have to take myself because I don't know where I'm going so I have to allow him to take over the driver's seat I have to let him have the preeminence in my life I have to allow him to have total control of my body and my thoughts in my mind so that I can express what he wants it's interesting brother Brown talks about he was up in in Washington state I think it was and he was preaching and there was a young man he was in the military and he was going to commit suicide because there was a spirit on him that bothered him that was bothering this individual and brother Brown spoke to him directly and then they began to go up the Alaskan Highway and they pulled into a restaurant to get something to eat and their brother bam was just joking being himself and all of a sudden another car pulled in and parked and that man was that he had brother Adam had talked to he says that man walked in the ones that I've told of that incident they says all of a sudden brother Brown's whole countenance changed because God needed him and so he went over and he ministered unto that young man and began to pray for him until that man was delivered from the spirit but see brother Bradham had to be willing to go ahead and yield himself to that spirit we had a brother in our church and he had on the he'd operate on his elbow the operation was successful and then they got an infection and uh anyway he he ended up going to to Charlotte I hate driving into Charlotte and God directed me he says you go pray for him but I hate going to Charlotte the traffic is horrible and anyway I was arguing and God says no you go pray well Isis wanted the pastor why not the deacons why not no you go I could have stopped God I had that power I could have said no and what God wanted me to do would have never been accomplished but I turned my will over to his will and I drove into Charlotte and went found the guy's room he was in and we'd visit a little bit and he kind of wondered well what are you doing here I says God sent me here to pray for you because the free with because what you're dealing with now is not a medical issue what you're dealing with now is a spiritual issue because there's a spirit in there which is attacking that elbow which is attacking what God had God had done and so I prayed I took authority over the demon that was in his elbow casting that out and from that point on then the healing began but if I had not gone never would have happened same in your lives God directs you if God is directing you obey it because God has a purpose for you going where you're going and doing the things which you're doing you don't have to call upon the pastor to pray I'm not saying you you know not to but do you realize that you have the same Authority and power that he has the Bible says where Kings and praise unto God what does the king do a king rules over a kingdom who do we rule over we were all over Satan's kingdom he has to obey us we are priests what does the priest do a priest intercedes on behalf of someone else so if somebody comes and you hey brother your sister hey I need a prayer Pray for him you have the same Authority you have the same right you have the same Holy Ghost pray for them because your faith will touch brother Bradham and another place he said there was this young lady she had a child the child was sick and all of a sudden God impressed upon this late after she'd given her seat to reprate here pray for this young child and she said well she's got a prayer card brother Adam's going to pray for the child and uh still she felt moved so she asked the lady in a nice quiet voice would you mind if I prayed for your child oh no she said that would be just wonderful so she prayed for the child and then she went and found another place to sit that mother and child were taken before brother Brown and brother Bradham looked at the thing he says well your child's already healed and then God says Hey somebody had prayed for you that young lady sitting up in the balcony she's the one that offered a prayer because of her prayer that child is healed it didn't have to be brother branham's prayer your prayers will have the same effect just enter into the spirit of God and let God through you begin to speak through you and then take care of the need of that person you don't have to I mean we have we have prayer list for people we pray for in our church and that's fine but why doesn't the person when this when somebody says Hey I want you to pray for us why don't you just do it I mean I'm not trying to do away with other people praying them don't get me wrong on this girl I know there was a time I thought my wife was having a heart attack um and when we were in the hospital and my prayers wouldn't get past the ceiling I relied upon the prayers of the Saints and our congregation I relied upon one of them touching the touching God for for us and God I honored that God went and he touched my wife and everything came out fine but like I said there are times my prayers ain't going to do anybody any good especially me so that's why I rely upon the body of Jesus Christ he says you get in touch with God I know when we were there in India this time all of a sudden my wife had caught the flu her breathing became labored and uneven and I said well Lord we're the only hope we've got so I got it I got on the internet managed to get in touch with my pastor and there's five or six of the brothers began to pray and a half an hour later her breathing became normal and regular and not labored and then she slept for the next day it was good it was damn interceding for us what's I mean but this goes with all of us brother Branham and the lady of sin Church age he says here he stands revealing who he is in this last age he calls himself the author of the creation of God creation of God this is another creation this has to do with the church there's a special designation of himself he is the creator of that church the Heavenly bridegroom created his own Bride As the spirit of God he came down and created in the Virgin Mary the cells which was necessary for about it to be formed he said what was God doing God was beginning to create himself just as he created it just as he created within Mary of the seed which was necessary to bring forth that body so God has also placed his seed in you and that seat is to grow into and to mature and eventually it's supposed to grow until you become the very manifestation of God himself brother Branham goes on he says this is talking about Jesus Christ he says this is the god man he was the son of God he was of the new creation got man and God met and joined he was the first of a new race he was the head of this new race you see what we you can see that through man was of the old order of creation but now in Union with Christ he has become a new creation of God when we join with Jesus Christ when we are in Jesus Christ when we literally become a part of him by the New Birth by by the new birth all of a sudden we become part we are no longer part of Adam's creation our body is yes because that's what Satan can attack but there's something inside that's different now we are the creation of God we are now God living in your flesh you know I I haven't we where we designate God the Father God the son okay God the Father with how God existed be when he when he was dealt in dealing with with uh with Israel wait that that you know okay but then we come to was God in Jesus Christ manifesting there he's okay now it's the Holy Spirit well I was raised in the Baptist Church so the trinitarian thought is always playing in my mind no God is God God in the Old Testament that was God he speak you know he he do whatever he what he did God in Jesus Christ that was still God God was manifesting himself in that body what does the holy spirit is God in Me It's God in you the same God that we look in the Old Testament where God spoke and all of us in the universe and everything came into creation that's the same God who dwells in you and that God doesn't has never been defeated everything is subject to him everything without exception so when all of a sudden Satan harasses you you say father this he's bothering me again why cry speak we make it complicated it's not right the message is simple the gospel is simple what it what the Simplicity is God now where's God dwelling he's in you well if God dwells in you why are you hindering him it's like we talked to the ones in India Where's God well he dwells in my heart well that's good why don't you let him out once in a while why don't you release him why don't you allow him to do what he wants to do because if you'll release the god that is within you all of a sudden God can express himself through you there's no difference here we make it complicated we all only the pastor can do this only the deacons can do no every member of the congregation there's no difference here if God dwells in you that's God Amen well if God dwells in you let him operate let him Express himself let him manifest himself amen this new creation is not an old creation made over or it can never be called in your creation this is exactly what it said it's a new creation this is another creation distinct from the old one it's no longer no longer is he dealing by ways of the flesh but now he that is how he dealt with Israel he chose Abraham and Abraham's seed Through The Godly light Isaac but now out of every Kindred tribe and Nation he has purposed a new creation he was the first of that creation he was God created in the form of man now by his Spirit he is creating many sons unto himself God the Creator creating himself a part of his creation God creating himself in you until you become the manifestation and the expression of God amen this is the message this is the whole purpose and the whole plan of God had children within God was with seeds God planted that seed God planted that seed in you that seed has to come to manifestation what can that what will that seed produce because it's the life of God the only thing it can produce is God and if you will allow that sea to continue to grow and mature inside it why do we come to church to receive encouragement to take that seed into water and then the fertilizer to give that seed what and what it needs until it can grow and grow and grow until finally it can come into full manifestation and and why did God send the prophet why all the Miracles and all the manifestations of God why why why why did we see why could he speak to the storm and call it out of existence why could he create squirrel speak to speak the squirrels into existence why could he pray for the sick and see them healed why could all these Miracles and manifestations and follow his life was that just Awakening like oh my that was wonderful in the prophet bring it to you what's the difference God is no respecter of persons he's not going to call it he's not going to make all of us prophets no that was the office that he had but we are Sons and Daughters of God there's no difference here there's no distinction he just allowed the God that was in him to express itself through him and now what's he trying to do he's trying to express himself through you there's no difference here but you have to believe that you have to be willing to accept what God says that you are and God sent the prophet in this generation for to you to us so that we could look at him and says oh that's God that's God expressing himself now where is God God lives inside of me what if he expressed himself from the prophet in that way he can express me the same way there's no difference There's no distinction what was the difference brother Branham knew who he was he knew he was the prophet to this age he knew God spoken to him he knew when God gave me Vision he knew that Vision was true he would go and he would act upon that Vision because he says God never lies well now all of a sudden God has come into us how does God speak to you does he whisper his thoughts and your ears I mean God speaks to me in different ways sometimes he speaks to me through the ministry sometimes he speaks to me through my wife sometimes he just something in my head I mean there are times he well he says you're having your attitude's terrible today isn't it I said yes sir he says don't you think you should change it well yes sir he says well yes sir so then you start singing songs and you try to enter into his presence God inhabits the praise of his people it's that simple I mean we're all human beings here I mean I don't think anybody here is above the point of ever having a bad day I mean so how do we get out of the bad day we create the atmosphere in which he is welcome you start singing praises to God Satan hates that so you start singing praises to God all of a sudden says I'm not going to stick around here I've heard enough you know and then all of a sudden God's presence is there and then everything changes this new creation is not the old creation made over or could not be called a new creation is exactly what it says it's a new creation this is another creationist thing from the old one we already read all of that okay it goes on uh in perfect faith brother Bradham makes a statement he says they had the word and the Word was flesh this is turned talking to disciples and the word told them I give you power amen I give you the power they had the power but they didn't have the faith to operate the word that was now in them Jesus Christ said I'm giving you the power I'm giving you the authority so they have the authority by virtue Jesus Christ told them I've given you that Authority it goes on he said he had Faith with his power talking about Jesus Christ how did he he says I can do nothing by myself he says watch he relied upon what he was he relied in knowing that he was the word he had Faith In The God Who had made him the word what is the bride today it's the word of God expressed that's you you are the word of God expressed for this generation that's who you are so accept the fact that you are the word expressed for this generation and begin to operate in that mode begin to have the faith and the god that has made you that word you didn't choose to be the word God chose you for that word God chose to make you part of the word for this generation else why would you listen why would you still believe in a prophet because the prophet was the word for Our Generation he delivered that word unto us to make us that word that spoken word of God and as we listen to the tapes and we listen to what God has told us through the prophet then all of a sudden we become the manifestation of that word we become the expression of that word so if God Made You the word why not accept the fact that you are the word brother Brown goes on and he says this is a true revelation of God this was his purpose this purpose took the form through election the election goes back to goes back to the foreign that goes back to the fact that you're the seed God foreknew you because he knew his seed because he knew who his seed was that's why he could forordain you that's why he could elect you because only the the only the only the the the seed of God is elected into for Redemption anyway he said that is why he could look down Through the Ages and couldn't look over and see that what see himself still in the midst of the church as the author of this new creation of God his Sovereign power brought it to pass here by his on decree he elected the members of this new creation he predestinated them to the adoption of children according to the good pleasure of his will and by his omniscience and omnipotence he has brought it to pass what do you do submit it's not about you it's about him Elijah I think was having a bad bad day and he said I'm the only one left God everybody there everybody's against me having his own little pity party and God spoke to his back he says no you're not the only one I have reserved to myself seven thousand God reserved them they could not fall because God reserved them God has a bride because God has reserved himself a bride God has chosen that bride God has looked over that bride that bride will come to come come to full manifestation that bride will will come into the full manifestation of God because he's the one that Jose has ordained you he is the one that has called you he is the one place to seed inside of you he is the one that has done all of these things and he is the one watching over his bride he is the one guarding and protecting her it's about him it's not about us but he elected us because we are a part of him you know Adam could never Adam could never deny Eve because Eve was a part of Adam Jesus Christ can never deny us because we were always a part of him we always were himself we always worry part of him and therefore he watches over his own bride he watches over that which he has elected that which was a part of him from the beginning and the restoration of the bright trees at that day which is this day you will know that I am in the Father the father's in me I am in you and you are in me oh I just love that and Satan gets so angry see the Oneness of God see the Oneness of God you are a part of God in the beginning you were his son and daughter you are going back into what you were from the beginning before the fall you were Sons and Daughters of God you were part of deity you are an expression of that deity because God's spirit dwells inside of you it's that spirit inside of you that makes you the expression of him and when you can when you can take yourself and push yourself aside and let that deity live its life out through you you become the expression of that deity why do people look at the brother Bradham and says oh yeah you're Jesus Christ he said well in one way that's true in another way it's wrong he said but when I yield myself to the spirit of God in Me then that yeah I am him I am expressing him I he Eve could never become Adam she was a part of Adam she could never be Adam we are the bride of Christ we are his wife we can never become him you try and make that transition brother Bram says you're making me Antichrist no I am an expression of him I am a part of him I am the one that God dwells inside of and so here again don't don't get confused when we get into that but you have to realize also who you are you are part of the godhead you because you are part of God God is a God wants to express himself through you and when you allow him to express himself through you then that's no longer you that's God but when we all of a sudden good when we all of a sudden go to the Rapture and all of a sudden we we have the changing our body then brother bam says that's going to be the adoption that's when we literally will become him that's when literally we won't literally because man we will be we will be we will become what we intent God intended for us to be from the beginning we will be a manifestation of God's children because we will be him well if we are a manifestation of God's children the the that brings us into deity we cannot die for anybody else because we can never be him if you fell on my line because there's a fine line here because some people are saying oh yeah I am I am Jesus Christ manifested in flesh well if if you cross the line that you've crossed the line then you become an antichrist and there's people going around today saying oh yeah I'm Jesus Christ no they've perverted the word and and that's extremely extremely dangerous and latest in church age he says when the Methodist failed God raised up others and so it has gone on through the years until in this last day there is another people in the land who under their messenger will be the final voice to the final age we do not have our own message we have to we are the continuation of the message of that God had given through the prophet we don't come up with our own psychology we don't come up with our own stuff if you're coming up with all of your own stuff and it's contrary to what God had spoken through the prophet it's wrong from that point on just turn them off and go to another station room and there's people that do that now they oh yeah I have a greater Revelation than brother Branham had I'm not interested turn it off no I'm interested in what God has tried to tell me through the Prophet The Prophet tells me who I am and the more I listen to what God spoke through the prophet the more I begin to realize no this is what I am this is what I am I am a Son of God I am I am I'm coming into the full manifestation of God I now realize that I have the authority over Satan I no longer have to put up with him I can tell him to pack his bag don't even bother packing it just get out don't even take the time just get out because I have the authority by virtue of what God has given to me by virtue of what I am I can sit there and I can tell Satan you have to leave and you have to do it now and so when somebody is sick I mean you just go up there and said they said well brother would you pray for me you got this sure so I pray for him a couple hours later he says boy the Pain's all gone well it says it sure has to be I said so you say that's awful arrogant well I have to believe what I pray God hears and if I pray and I believe God hears then I've got his hair then God's going to answer that so I I don't mean to sound arrogant when I say that but I have to I have to have faith in what I am doing I have to have faith in the god that has called me I have to have faith when God anoints me to pray I have to believe that that's God speaking through me and it's not me he said the church was no longer the mouthpiece of God it's his own mouthpiece so God is turning on her and he will confound her through the prophet and the bride for the voice of God will be in her people relate that oh just through the prophet no in her we have to be the seed coming into full manifestation we have to be that sea that was planted on the day of Pentagon we have to come to the place where that seed comes into full expression which means we have to become the full expression of Jesus Christ in order for that to happen we have to yield ourselves to the spirit of God that is in us and let him have the preeminence in our lives and have a control and once we will make that transition once we will begin to acknowledge I am a Son of God I am a daughter of God once we begin to understand God dwells inside of me and The God Who dwells inside of me is all-powerful and all my there's nothing that he cannot do and then allow that God to operate through you and everybody brother Brown says when the weakest of saints gets on her knees Satan trembles weakest of saints okay anyway and you swore by himself brother Brown makes a statement he says faith is unconscious he says you believe it I've learned that through the years of travel around the world and meeting the people of all different walks faith is unconscious you got faith and you don't even know it that's right Jesus no matter if he was in the storm and the Gail was knocking the boat from one side to the other he was standing in the face of a mess of demons or if he was hanging anywhere it never moved him he walked right on just as calm and quiet as he could be why he was simply unconscious of fear of anything around him that's right whether it's going to happen or whether it wasn't going to happen he known that it was going to happen because God had said so he said you're here to fulfill it too just walk unconscious of fear walk unconscious of criticism walk unconscious of the world welcome walk as you walk in Christ walk with him and paying any attention to the Riders to the left just keep on just keep on moving he says you'll have your ups and downs don't worry you've got to go through the Briar patches and over the sharp rocks and over the Bluffs and down the hillsides and up the mountains and over the waters but just walk with God and the more we can walk with God that's when we can have rest when we walk with God and we know that he's there then all of a sudden nothing I mean I look at the world situation if I didn't believe what I believe I would be scared I don't know about tomorrow I don't know what our government's going to try to do tomorrow I know they're trying to destroy this nation they're working they're very good at it they're doing an excellent job at that but I have something inside of me that gives me rest it doesn't matter what the government does I'm part of a different Kingdom and God says God says that if I will walk with him he will take care of me in in one last thought I did a study on habakkuk a number of years ago and that changed my life habit could give you his only four chapters if you read the book of story book of habakkuk God was going to spend judgment upon Jerusalem upon the nation he was in God was going to send the Chaldeans in they were they love to kill people have a cook was scared of his own life and he began to pray and God spoke to him he he says if you think you can I have to paraphrase he says if you think you can do it you can survive it on your own good luck I'll just take my hands off and you know wish you luck but he said if you will put your faith in me I will take care of you this is where Paul goes back to just shall live by faith they will they will have faith in the god that has called them where if you can count into that Realms of faith it doesn't matter what comes doesn't matter what the government does doesn't matter what the economy does no if you will walk in Christ if you will take and put your total confidence in him he will take care of you God bless you with the bomb God bless you brother I was just that wasn't that a rich message thank God that for that promise that where the carcass is the Eagles will be gathered together because I believe we've gathered together around the world this morning I just wrote down some things while my brother was speaking to think that if you can be identified to know that we are his body and that this is Who We Are and we don't have to put up with the devil that's what our brother said we don't have to put up with the devil this morning so if you've got a need this morning I uh we've
