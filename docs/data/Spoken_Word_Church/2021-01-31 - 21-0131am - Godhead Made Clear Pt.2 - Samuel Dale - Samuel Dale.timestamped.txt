[0:56] remember brother bob is up i think with
[0:58] brother
[0:59] uh chris shane's preaching this weekend
[1:02] and brother
[1:02] luis is interpreting uh

[1:08] today so let's keep them
[1:10] in your mind brother bob will be
[1:13] ministering to the lord willing this
[1:14] coming wednesday so
[1:16] we get all of those things on on on the
[1:19] right way
[1:20] uh let's see
[1:25] yeah i'd i'd ask you we were listening
[1:27] to a tape the other night and it really
[1:29] fits the
[1:30] parts that i'm trying to bring and if
[1:33] you would
[1:33] either read or listen to the prophet's
[1:37] message
[1:38] on who is this melchizedek
[1:41] you'll find the very wordings of things
[1:44] not necessarily that i picked them out
[1:46] of that message
[1:47] but uh you know you will find a lot of
[1:50] the things that we're talking about
[1:52] so uh you know do that and and and study
[1:55] that just a little bit all right
[1:57] uh let's see anything else we got uh
[2:00] we got the announcements about the the
[2:03] uh valentines for next week
[2:06] uh this coming saturday and we've got
[2:10] the
[2:11] all right yeah we're uh we're going to
[2:14] just ask you if you want to
[2:16] i know we're we're a little tight in the
[2:18] way we're trying to do
[2:19] uh in the services but we just ask you
[2:23] if you want to do you want to just have
[2:25] a vote on it and remove the
[2:27] the blue tape and that way you can
[2:29] spread a little bit more
[2:31] uh you know and not be so tight
[2:34] we still want to stay separated as much
[2:37] as possible
[2:39] and also to make sure and wear our mask
[2:42] you know in the services and the things
[2:44] here and while you're here
[2:45] at the church and all because that's
[2:48] taking care of us so just remember that
[2:50] i talked to brother altic this week he
[2:53] has
[2:53] uh the virus and he's doing better so
[2:56] just keep praying for him and to do it
[2:58] and many others are
[2:59] are doing it so uh remember that let's
[3:01] see there's something else i was going
[3:03] to try to remember
[3:04] i'll think of it when i get into the
[3:05] message but uh
[3:07] i lost some memory yesterday because i
[3:10] met head on with a 2x6
[3:12] and it won uh you know so that was
[3:16] you know i shouldn't have been trying to
[3:18] to move it right where it was that but i
[3:20] tangled up in some
[3:22] twine that was on the ground and went
[3:25] head first into a two by six course
[3:27] you'd never notice it
[3:28] you know that's uh that's what you're to
[3:31] make sure
[3:32] that they told me said you make sure and
[3:34] tell them what happened
[3:36] you know we don't want nobody thinking
[3:38] over here beating me up you know
[3:40] but that's that'd be doing but just uh
[3:43] thank god that he did take care of him
[3:45] because it could have been worse or
[3:46] something would have been there you know
[3:49] the two by six was bad but if they'd
[3:51] have been nailed or something there
[3:52] the lord takes care of us in all that
[3:55] we're doing okay
[3:58] second corinthians 5 and then we'll go
[4:01] to
[4:01] hebrews did you
[4:05] aren't everybody in favor of removing
[4:07] the
[4:08] things to where we can spread out a
[4:10] little bit
[4:11] uh well okay that would be the majority
[4:14] of the people
[4:15] that way we can spread out a little bit
[4:17] a little better and have more seating
[4:19] capacity but just remember still
[4:22] don't pack up that's the point that
[4:25] we're driving at
[4:26] that we've been driving at is to uh have
[4:29] you to
[4:30] move a little further apart where it
[4:32] wouldn't be so much you're sitting for
[4:33] the time
[4:34] and we are talking about now uh on down
[4:37] a little bit further maybe we'll pick up
[4:39] the sunday school
[4:41] for the children and things you know and
[4:43] begin to get a few things back in
[4:45] but now we're not um oh yeah
[4:49] we're not ruling people with what
[4:51] they're trying to do in this
[4:53] if you want to go down in the basement
[4:54] you feel free to go and and watch it
[4:56] there you know and do the things
[4:58] and all of that now uh
[5:01] i was asked about this taking these
[5:03] shots and things for this
[5:05] virus i'm not going to tell you not to
[5:08] take it
[5:09] but i'm not going to tell you to take it
[5:11] i'm going to let you leave it up to
[5:13] yourself that's
[5:14] because that would be the point you say
[5:16] well i have to well then all right
[5:18] but i'm saying it this way we we have
[5:20] had
[5:21] plenty of viruses before that we had to
[5:24] take
[5:25] polio smallpox measles
[5:28] we've had to take those things i see
[5:30] nothing wrong
[5:32] if i did i would tell you i see nothing
[5:34] wrong with taking
[5:36] these shots but it's still left up to
[5:38] you to do that
[5:39] it may be mandatory in your job
[5:42] something that you're doing or whatever
[5:44] may be mandatory
[5:45] it may be mandatory for all of us before
[5:47] long all right then we
[5:49] we do what we've got to do we're just
[5:52] trying to
[5:53] get by while we're here and not be to
[5:56] well
[5:56] well you got to do this you got to do
[5:58] that well
[6:00] we don't think you've got faith because
[6:01] don't get into all of that
[6:04] don't don't get into those things you
[6:05] know talking about
[6:07] if somebody takes a shot they ain't got
[6:09] faith what did you take to polio did you
[6:11] take smallpox did you take any of those
[6:14] no just don't do that just just be what
[6:18] we are
[6:19] we are the body of christ and and we're
[6:22] praying and we pray to do
[6:24] now i do say for you to do one thing
[6:26] i've always said this now
[6:28] if you go to our house and we've got a
[6:29] medicine cabinet
[6:31] thing right as you start out the back
[6:33] door
[6:34] and you know what's in there are
[6:35] medicines and things but you know what's
[6:37] in that
[6:38] it's prayer claws stuck on the wall
[6:42] or laid in there of the the cabinets
[6:45] i i tell you to anytime you get a
[6:48] medication
[6:49] pray that god would sanctify that
[6:53] what's the problem why can't we do that
[6:55] ask him to turn it around
[6:57] um brother colleen's wife oh uh
[7:00] she had a thing years ago and
[7:03] and uh she's they took out her pituitary
[7:07] or how you pronounce it gland or
[7:08] whatever
[7:09] and you know and she got to getting
[7:12] sicker
[7:13] and so she asked me about it i said well
[7:16] let's just pray
[7:17] that god will turn that thing around
[7:20] and make it to where it'll be right well
[7:23] you know what we prayed
[7:24] in just a few days you know what they've
[7:25] done they took her off of the medication
[7:28] that was a medication she was told she
[7:30] would have to take the rest of her life
[7:33] because you got to have the gland to
[7:35] produce the uh
[7:37] insulins for the body some way all right
[7:39] but just keep those things in mind and
[7:42] and also you know that we'll do it okay
[7:44] uh
[7:46] anybody with any comment about it
[7:49] sister trudy
[7:52] and i feel fine today it's just sore
[7:54] right where they put
[7:57] yeah well it that's all right so we just
[7:59] you do whatever you
[8:01] you're led to do and don't worry about
[8:03] nobody else if somebody else don't take
[8:04] it that's fine
[8:06] if you want to take it that's fine
[8:07] because you just think about how many
[8:09] shots you've gotten
[8:11] that your children take that you don't
[8:12] want to take
[8:14] you know and i'll tell you that the
[8:17] doctor told me
[8:18] he said sam at your age and you've been
[8:20] in that hospital five days
[8:22] said there ain't no telling what they
[8:24] gave you
[8:26] said it may take a long time to get that
[8:28] out of your system
[8:30] well that's all you know they're trying
[8:33] they're practicing medicine but see
[8:37] you just don't know what's going on so
[8:39] we just trust god
[8:42] and thank him for being with us right
[8:44] okay all right
[8:45] father just be with us in your loving
[8:47] grace and all that we do here we've
[8:48] committed to you
[8:49] and believing that you'll take care of
[8:51] us now just open the word unto us this
[8:53] day that we may walk in the light of
[8:55] your grace
[8:56] forgive our sins and lead us be with
[8:58] this sick lord
[8:59] all among us there's many sicknesses
[9:01] many things that are happening but
[9:03] lord just be with each one we love you
[9:06] we thank you
[9:07] in jesus name amen
[9:10] okay second corinthians 5.
[9:20] we'll start reading about verse 16.
[9:24] wherefore henceforth know we know man
[9:26] after the flesh
[9:28] yea though we have known christ after
[9:30] the flesh
[9:31] yet none that yet now henceforth know we
[9:34] him no more what after the flesh we know
[9:37] him by the holy spirit we know him by
[9:38] the new birth
[9:40] therefore if any man be in christ he is
[9:42] a new creature
[9:44] old things are passed away and behold
[9:46] all things are become new
[9:48] and all things are of god who hath
[9:50] reconciled us to himself
[9:52] by jesus christ and have given to us
[9:55] the ministry of reconciliation give it
[9:57] now on down to us
[9:59] to un to wit to understand that god was
[10:02] in christ
[10:03] what is the ministry of reconciliation
[10:05] that god was
[10:07] in christ right
[10:12] reconciling the world unto himself not
[10:15] imputing their trespasses unto them and
[10:17] hath committed
[10:18] unto us the word of reconciliation all
[10:21] right
[10:22] now let's stop there and then we'll go
[10:24] to
[10:25] hebrews we're going to try to get to
[10:28] this today if we can
[10:31] hebrews 10 verse 1 for the law having a
[10:34] shadow of good things to come
[10:37] and not the very image of the things
[10:40] can never with these sacrifices which
[10:43] they offered
[10:45] year by year continually make the comers
[10:49] there and too perfect for then would
[10:52] they not have
[10:54] ceased to be offered because that
[10:57] the worshiper once purged should have
[11:00] had no more
[11:01] conscience of sin but in
[11:04] those sacrifices
[11:08] the in that old testament things and all
[11:10] and those sacrificed
[11:12] it couldn't take away couldn't make it
[11:13] right but in those sacrifices there is a
[11:16] remembrance
[11:17] again made of sins every year
[11:20] for it is not possible that the blood of
[11:22] bulls and goats
[11:24] should take away sin wherefore when you
[11:27] he cometh into the world now something's
[11:30] fixing to take place wherefore when he
[11:32] who jesus christ
[11:36] cometh into the world he saith sacrifice
[11:39] and offering thy wood us not but a body
[11:42] has thou prepared me you may be seated
[11:45] the lord at his blessing to the
[11:47] reading of the word
[11:51] now we were trying in our last message
[11:54] to
[11:56] cover some things and review backwards
[11:58] and forth and we
[11:59] we continually do those things but i do
[12:02] i would ask you if you would if you just
[12:04] want something
[12:05] to see where we're going and what we're
[12:08] doing
[12:10] get the message of who
[12:13] is this melchizedek and just listen to
[12:17] it
[12:18] and you'll hear the very words that i
[12:20] use because that's where i got it from
[12:23] all right not saying necessarily go into
[12:26] a word for word
[12:27] thing but i do read a lot of quotes and
[12:30] i'm sorry today that about the quotes i
[12:32] i messed up and and left some of the
[12:34] homes from the notes so
[12:35] i didn't have time to rerun once i found
[12:38] out what was going on
[12:40] i didn't have time to rerun some of it
[12:41] so if you want to take
[12:43] the quotes and the things for today let
[12:45] me know i'll be glad to run them off and
[12:47] give them to you
[12:48] but some of you got them i know that all
[12:50] right
[12:51] but now think about what we're trying to
[12:53] do
[12:55] we're talking about the revealing
[12:59] of almighty god god made
[13:02] plain you know
[13:06] by the things that we see
[13:12] even the eternal godhead is made plain
[13:16] by what we see we see a human being we
[13:18] see a father a son
[13:20] a human a person to do it and and we can
[13:23] see those attributes and see that
[13:25] that it's in god and bringing it down to
[13:29] us
[13:29] that we can see those things you know
[13:32] all right
[13:32] and we'll do that and and we're trying
[13:35] to pick that up then
[13:36] the godhead made plain or clear to us
[13:40] we went through the before the
[13:41] foundation of the world the things of
[13:43] god coming into being
[13:45] you know and stepping forth and
[13:47] revealing himself to mankind
[13:50] then we brought it into adam and them
[13:52] and bringing it down
[13:53] and then our last couple of messages has
[13:55] centered
[13:56] coming down to jesus christ
[13:59] all right and as we read here in the
[14:02] scripture
[14:03] about he said a body thou has prepared
[14:07] all right now that's what i want you to
[14:10] think about today
[14:11] i want you to listen what the prophet is
[14:13] saying and think about
[14:17] how clear god is making himself known
[14:20] through the prophet's message
[14:23] all right and we can read it and study
[14:25] it
[14:26] and see that it's just clear and plain
[14:30] if we'll just believe it that way and
[14:32] accept it and and not worry about it and
[14:35] and we can uh you know try to uh
[14:38] cover the things like i said we covered
[14:40] before the foundation world
[14:42] then we come on up now we've kind of got
[14:44] over into
[14:46] the lord jesus christ god
[14:49] and knowing that the world as we read
[14:52] was
[14:52] would be reconciled by him
[14:56] all right because that would be the
[14:58] message he would bring redemption
[15:01] you know right way preaching on
[15:02] redemption you know
[15:04] the things and and all of that and these
[15:06] other brothers have been preaching on it
[15:07] good so i hope you
[15:08] you listen to the things but bringing
[15:10] forth the
[15:11] redemptive plan
[15:14] and seeing that it's coming down to you
[15:17] and me now
[15:18] all right we covered it coming into the
[15:20] lord jesus
[15:22] and in the things and now it's come to
[15:24] us we'll try to pick that up in the
[15:26] message
[15:27] more today all right but we covered
[15:31] how that god is making himself clear
[15:36] and plain i think he's not trying
[15:40] to hide it it's hidden from the wise and
[15:42] prudent
[15:44] but revealed to the bride of christ
[15:48] what even the eternal godhead
[15:52] can be made known unto us the scripture
[15:54] said
[15:55] by the things that we see
[15:59] so you go through what the providence
[16:01] says he said you're a father you're a
[16:02] son you're a human
[16:03] you're this you're that you've got many
[16:05] manifestations and all that
[16:07] but said it's all bringing it back to
[16:09] see the one person
[16:12] all right now today we're going to be
[16:15] dealing with
[16:16] the body of christ
[16:20] all right and dealing with that the body
[16:22] that was prepared or
[16:24] are fixed and we know that god
[16:29] created that body
[16:33] all right he created that body through
[16:36] the virgin birth and the things
[16:38] we can go through all of that and we
[16:40] know that fits in good
[16:41] and comes out and as it does we can see
[16:44] that the
[16:45] the things are and then seeing that he
[16:48] come to live in that body
[16:51] he prepared it he didn't create it
[16:56] like we we've spent a lot of time
[16:58] talking about that right
[16:59] we think about that he created a body he
[17:01] didn't necessarily create a body
[17:04] he brought it forth by the virgin birth
[17:09] see and brother the scripture would call
[17:11] it the only begotten
[17:14] he was the only one begotten that way
[17:17] right
[17:18] he was the only one with the virgin
[17:20] birth he was begotten
[17:23] whereas adam was created a full-grown
[17:26] man
[17:26] standing there jesus had to come as a
[17:29] baby
[17:30] to be begotten but it would provide a
[17:34] body
[17:36] okay now we'll get into these things as
[17:38] we're going along
[17:39] and he he said now these these
[17:41] tabernacles that you're building and
[17:43] things
[17:45] they're okay you know everybody want to
[17:47] build a tabernacle i want to do
[17:48] something
[17:49] he said that's fine but he said i don't
[17:50] dwell on that
[17:53] i don't dwell in buildings and houses
[17:56] made by man
[18:00] he said i do i dwell in a body
[18:03] see that was his purpose of wanting to
[18:05] do that not to set up in a building and
[18:07] let us come around and worship him
[18:10] you know back there or any time
[18:14] to try to get us to see who he is and
[18:17] what he's doing
[18:19] and he's revealing himself
[18:23] all right reconciling or redeeming the
[18:26] world to himself
[18:28] all right and as he's doing that it was
[18:31] necessary
[18:35] that he would come into the world the
[18:37] way he came
[18:38] i was saying a minute ago you know he
[18:40] wasn't created
[18:42] as we think of he was begotten
[18:45] he was brought into being by the newber
[18:47] or by birth
[18:49] we have to take a new birth to become
[18:52] parts of the body of christ
[18:54] all right but he was the almighty god
[18:57] we'll get back to some of this a little
[18:58] later and he was the according to
[19:01] the bible he was the fullness of the
[19:03] godhead bodily
[19:07] all right then you've got all the
[19:08] statements you want that brother branham
[19:10] i don't know how many you'd have but
[19:12] how many you want where he said all god
[19:14] was he poured into christ
[19:16] all christ he pours into the church and
[19:19] take her back to the garden of eden
[19:22] huh then he would say it in another way
[19:25] all god was he poured into christ all
[19:27] christ into the church
[19:29] the fullness we'll get back i've got
[19:32] those notes and the things then
[19:33] at the house ready for to bring forth
[19:36] the things
[19:37] and that's what i'm saying if you'll
[19:38] listen somewhere in those series
[19:41] if you'll go in the series where he was
[19:43] preaching at the tabernacle
[19:45] uh when uh marriage and divorce was
[19:47] preached
[19:48] it's about five messages he really
[19:52] brings in the understanding of the
[19:55] godhead
[19:56] and makes it real clear throughout those
[19:59] series there then he preaches marriage
[20:02] and divorce
[20:03] the greatest of all messages that he
[20:06] ever brought
[20:08] but the other was a background
[20:11] see we don't look at brother branham a
[20:13] lot of times what he's doing
[20:14] and i look at something and i said all
[20:17] right now what's the background
[20:19] see when he come forth to preach the
[20:20] seals
[20:22] he didn't just come into the tabernacle
[20:24] and say i'm gonna preach first seal
[20:28] no he preached what
[20:32] god in simplicity one true and living
[20:36] god
[20:36] brought it down through the ways and all
[20:38] through the bible up and down
[20:40] and then he preached the breach
[20:43] which would show what would stand
[20:45] between mankind
[20:48] and an almighty god would have to be
[20:52] the savior jesus christ
[20:55] see he lays a background a lot of time
[20:57] and if you'll notice his message
[20:59] especially in the series is where he's
[21:01] preaching in one place
[21:03] you'll see him do it he'll be
[21:06] he'll background so much until
[21:09] you're not getting a lot of the message
[21:11] over this way because
[21:13] he's backgrounding what he said back
[21:14] here but he knows if you don't get what
[21:17] he said then you won't get what he
[21:18] will say so he wants it to put it be put
[21:22] into that order all right
[21:23] now then thinking about it a body
[21:29] you realize what i'm trying to say we go
[21:31] through the
[21:32] godhead and the understanding and
[21:33] thinking
[21:35] but you see god is not perfect we've
[21:38] been through that right
[21:40] without father son holy ghost takes that
[21:43] to make
[21:44] god complete you're not complete without
[21:47] body spirit soul etc
[21:49] because you're an example so you can see
[21:51] the eternal godhead
[21:53] and what is eternal godhead father son
[21:55] and holy ghost
[21:57] can be seen or understood by the things
[21:59] that we live our lives and all of the
[22:01] happening
[22:02] and the grace the trees the things you
[22:04] know and we can see every bit of that
[22:06] all right then see doing that then we
[22:09] can follow it
[22:10] and and see what he's trying to do
[22:14] is make himself known
[22:18] because that was his purpose in the
[22:19] beginning was to make himself known to
[22:22] the
[22:22] one that he created all right see then
[22:26] we filed it up got into all the other
[22:28] things and all
[22:29] but yet he's still coming back in the
[22:31] end time to try to bring that back
[22:33] all right uh i'll say it like he said it
[22:36] when he talks about it watch this when
[22:37] he speaks of
[22:38] of the goodness of the godhead bodily
[22:42] you ever noticed him say this he said
[22:44] couldn't do it to david luther
[22:49] well god was there he was with them and
[22:52] given them a new birth
[22:54] he said couldn't do it in wesley he said
[22:57] couldn't do it in pentecost
[22:59] he said but it's now see now is the time
[23:03] to come forth of the understanding
[23:06] of all things to where we can follow
[23:08] that because what do you think it's
[23:10] going to do
[23:10] are we going to expect to go out of here
[23:12] in a change of the body one day
[23:14] when we just haphazardly float along
[23:16] this you know just oh we'll
[23:17] we're going to make it one day no
[23:24] we better be serious
[23:27] these things are just play parties
[23:28] that's going on now i've told you that
[23:30] to start with
[23:32] i see these viruses and things like that
[23:34] what's the virus got to do with
[23:35] salvation
[23:40] but see they will use those things
[23:42] eventually against us yes
[23:44] but it has nothing to do they're not
[23:45] trying to teach you a trinity
[23:47] in a virus when you go down take a shots
[23:49] you automatically get to trinity
[23:52] well that'd be something i don't want
[23:56] the trinity
[23:58] you know i certainly don't want no shot
[24:00] to get it
[24:02] but think about it see
[24:05] just think seriously about what we've
[24:07] tried to bring we went through the old
[24:09] the part of before the foundational
[24:11] world and bringing him down as to being
[24:13] the creation
[24:14] standing there in the world the great
[24:16] creator the almighty god
[24:18] the word that would create all things
[24:21] right
[24:22] and now we're coming into a point that
[24:24] he creates a body
[24:27] all right see bringing that body into
[24:31] existence
[24:32] to where he could dwell in it
[24:37] right you realize then that he was not
[24:41] complete
[24:42] until that body came into existence
[24:46] i have no problems with the brothers
[24:48] years ago preaching those
[24:49] river jordans and things if it had just
[24:51] held it to the right point
[24:54] if they just kept it on down to where
[24:56] that you can see
[24:57] and i have no trouble with the oneness
[24:59] people that that he's
[25:01] they believe that jesus was the the last
[25:04] immorphy of god i don't agree with that
[25:06] i believe the bride of jesus christ is
[25:07] the last and morph of god
[25:10] all right see then i'm i'm just this me
[25:13] and that's what i believe
[25:15] because i can stay with the word with it
[25:17] all right
[25:18] and see without a body god is not
[25:20] complete that's right
[25:22] all right he said well what do you need
[25:25] a body for he needed a body to display
[25:27] his attributes
[25:31] right adam came along and made a way
[25:35] through god making him a body to where
[25:38] that sin
[25:40] would would come into existence and that
[25:43] he would
[25:44] you know use that to where that he could
[25:46] bring forth his attributes
[25:50] all right so god is not complete without
[25:54] it being father son and holy ghost
[25:57] body spirit soul all right
[26:01] see then by being the body
[26:04] he needed a body to step into
[26:07] because he wanted to fellowship with his
[26:09] people he doesn't want to
[26:11] and now listen what i'm saying he didn't
[26:13] want in the old testament to set up on a
[26:15] on a platform you know and they come in
[26:18] and bow down
[26:19] oh god we love you and then and then
[26:22] turn around he didn't want that
[26:27] neither does he want to sit in any kind
[26:29] of building now
[26:31] that's right not something made by man
[26:35] we'll get to it at the license but don't
[26:37] i'll get to it later to worthy when it
[26:39] comes to the point
[26:40] see now is when he's getting his
[26:44] complete plan that's why i said
[26:45] he couldn't do it and luther couldn't do
[26:47] it wesley couldn't do it in pentecost
[26:48] now he can come forth in the fullness of
[26:51] the godhead
[26:52] bodily in the bride of jesus christ
[26:58] now don't worry about it don't think
[26:59] what a brother dale i just don't agree
[27:00] with that we'll just go ahead
[27:02] i've been preaching it for 50 years so
[27:04] don't worry about it i ain't going to
[27:05] change
[27:06] what i mean is by i believe 50 years ago
[27:09] that the bride would be the fullness of
[27:11] the godhead bodily
[27:12] because the prophet said it i still
[27:14] believe that
[27:16] if you don't believe it that's up to you
[27:20] see that's where the whole catch is
[27:22] we're looking for something else instead
[27:24] of looking to ourselves
[27:26] to see where god is dwelling within us
[27:29] he didn't want to sit back there
[27:32] and say oh children i love you
[27:36] he doesn't want to do that now he wants
[27:39] to live in his people
[27:44] he's not satisfied without being able to
[27:47] live
[27:48] in his people not to just live with his
[27:50] people
[27:52] with it's fine but that's not the whole
[27:54] point he wants to live
[27:56] in you and me
[27:59] because i'll give them to you when i get
[28:01] to our tutor i've got about either seven
[28:03] or eight times where he said
[28:04] the bride is the fullness of the godhead
[28:06] bodily well if you don't believe that
[28:07] that's up to you
[28:10] that's just telling you what i believe
[28:11] the prophet said and i can show it by
[28:13] what he said it ain't something
[28:15] a doctrinal thing you know well they got
[28:16] one quote well i don't care if i just
[28:18] got one quote i'm still happy with it
[28:22] because i believe the quote's right you
[28:24] know what i mean
[28:25] if i just got one to prove it with then
[28:27] how much do i need
[28:30] i don't mind putting it in plain
[28:32] language we should be able to accept
[28:36] the message of the hour today
[28:39] over basically when we come into the
[28:42] message because
[28:43] we were just studying it we were just
[28:45] looking at it we were trying to
[28:48] comprehend it and but now it's opening
[28:51] up
[28:51] yes it is we see are you worried about
[28:54] storms and
[28:55] and viruses and stuff like that uh
[28:59] you better be worried about some what
[29:01] somebody's teaching you an understanding
[29:03] of the godhead
[29:04] i don't mind putting it that way you
[29:06] better be scared you better check out
[29:08] what is being said to you
[29:09] by me
[29:12] by these brothers check out what they're
[29:14] saying
[29:17] why because we don't want to be deceived
[29:23] well i ain't going to be deceived i'm
[29:25] born again
[29:27] well i hope you finally get on to one
[29:30] thing
[29:31] you say well we couldn't do this
[29:32] couldn't do that i tried to prove a
[29:34] point to you back there
[29:36] adam was eternal life in his soul
[29:40] eve was eternal life in her soul the
[29:43] prophet said it
[29:45] you know what they fail they didn't die
[29:48] and go to hell no
[29:49] they fell from coming to where they
[29:51] should have come
[29:53] that's the thing sitting before you and
[29:55] me is to come to the position the
[29:57] situation
[29:58] to where we can walk right into the word
[30:00] and say thank you lord
[30:06] that bang hit my head i got up i said
[30:08] thank you lord
[30:10] well that's still alive at least i
[30:12] thought it was
[30:15] you know yeah
[30:18] i'm i'm happy about what god is doing
[30:24] and i was happy years ago about it and
[30:26] i'm more happy now
[30:27] because i'm beginning to see more light
[30:33] that's what we're looking for because
[30:35] that's what's going to change these
[30:36] bodies is a revealed word
[30:38] amen what else is it going to be you
[30:41] tell me what it is
[30:46] it's the revealed word yes
[30:49] it's going to change you and me but it's
[30:52] got to be to the basis you remember the
[30:53] other weakness right
[30:54] it's got to be to the basis when we get
[30:56] down to the basis of saying by stripes
[30:58] i'm healed
[31:01] by justification same case in baptism
[31:03] i'm saved
[31:04] we've got to make a statement
[31:08] a commitment and hold it at that
[31:12] with the mouth confession is made with a
[31:14] heart man that believes
[31:16] we've got to put that down into the
[31:18] right place and get it to where we can
[31:20] not be afraid
[31:25] if you're afraid then you you need
[31:28] something to comfort
[31:30] that's the only thing that i've said to
[31:31] you about the church now
[31:33] i ain't said a word about anybody that
[31:35] didn't come or don't but if you're
[31:37] willing to go out in this world and go
[31:38] to walmart every other day
[31:40] and go shopping and all that but you
[31:42] can't come to church
[31:44] now don't talk to me like that now i'm
[31:46] sorry
[31:47] i'm not trying to condemn you
[31:51] i think our first purpose in life should
[31:53] be one thing
[31:54] the serving of the lord jesus christ is
[31:57] our god and savior that should be the
[32:00] first thing in our lives the rest of it
[32:02] fits in there okay all right get it
[32:06] get on with it brother okay come on
[32:08] listen
[32:09] all right let's just read something
[32:10] because i want to let you read what your
[32:12] prophet says
[32:14] about the fact that god
[32:17] had to have a body to come and dwell in
[32:22] to make him complete
[32:28] to make him come into the way he wanted
[32:31] to come
[32:34] he loved coming down with adam and eve
[32:36] in the garden is that the way the
[32:38] prophet said
[32:38] he'd come down and talk to him children
[32:40] have you had a good time today
[32:46] he wanted to fellowship with him
[32:50] and even after sin entered the picture
[32:53] it didn't take away his desire to
[32:54] fellowship with his people
[32:58] he never condemned eve he never
[33:00] condemned adam come on i'm quoting very
[33:02] random
[33:04] he condemned the serpent he condemned
[33:05] the earth and things like that but not
[33:07] adam and eve
[33:08] why how could he condemn if they had
[33:11] eternal life in their souls
[33:12] right
[33:16] true amen if they had eternal life in
[33:19] their soul how could he condemn him
[33:21] because he's when he gave them eternal
[33:23] life he can't give you eternal life and
[33:26] condemn you
[33:27] sure he can tell you you're wrong he can
[33:29] tell you off he can
[33:31] he can you know
[33:34] he can hit us in the head with a two
[33:36] before
[33:39] he can do all them things but he still
[33:42] ain't going to turn you down
[33:46] huh because you're sealed in
[33:50] he said well then i'll just go out and
[33:51] live that proves you're not sealed in
[33:55] you say i'll just go live like you know
[33:57] i can just it don't matter what i do
[33:59] oh you're gonna get a weapon
[34:02] i'm talking about a child now i'm not
[34:04] talking about people that are sinners
[34:06] that are not born again
[34:07] i'm talking about the children of god's
[34:09] going when god's going to whip
[34:11] he chastens his children
[34:16] if he could turn around about correcting
[34:18] a child and say beat the child that
[34:19] won't die
[34:20] how much more should he be able to beat
[34:22] me and you and that's come up saying
[34:24] thank you lord
[34:25] i love you i'm glad you
[34:29] thought enough of me to put that there
[34:31] and let me come forth
[34:33] now just help me through the next one
[34:35] you know
[34:36] all right let's let's let's get started
[34:38] and read some
[34:41] go ahead with number one brothers will
[34:44] we'll read these and just because i want
[34:47] you to listen to what your prophet is
[34:49] saying
[34:51] and by all of these be able to at least
[34:54] believe
[34:56] that god dwelt on earth
[35:00] in a body yes
[35:04] the body wasn't just something thrown in
[35:07] half had
[35:08] it was perfect
[35:12] but yet because it was brought into
[35:14] being
[35:15] it was a temporal body
[35:19] so it had to be redeemed not redeemed
[35:22] because it was sinful
[35:24] no but because it was not eternal
[35:27] that's right all right
[35:31] see then he would need the redemption of
[35:34] part of the body to be able to come
[35:36] forth
[35:37] but not to the point to where that he's
[35:39] trying to uh
[35:41] well let's read listen there's only one
[35:44] way of provided by god
[35:47] he was god's word made manifest
[35:50] he was god's promise vindicated
[35:53] he was he was god in a flesh
[35:57] form
[36:00] the bible said that god was in christ
[36:03] that great jehovah that created heaven
[36:06] and earth
[36:07] was made manifest in a body the lord
[36:10] jesus christ
[36:11] and then that one man he could achieve
[36:16] all right there's something daughter
[36:18] down i don't know
[36:19] until he tried it though through moses
[36:21] he tried it through moses he tried it
[36:23] through
[36:24] jacob he tried it through joseph but
[36:26] they couldn't come forth
[36:28] but he come in the fullness of the god
[36:30] of the man
[36:31] christ he was
[36:34] the fullness of the godhead bodily
[36:37] see that can take what these couldn't do
[36:42] what moses couldn't do what this
[36:43] couldn't do what me and you couldn't do
[36:45] you say well i think i can handle it
[36:46] myself you in bad shape
[36:50] no i'd rather be a failure than try to
[36:53] think i'm doing it myself
[36:55] but listen he was the fullness of the
[37:00] godhead bodily
[37:01] where god could express himself
[37:04] and he said who can accuse me of sin
[37:08] sin is unbelief haven't done exactly
[37:10] what the scripture said i would do
[37:12] then who can condemn me and say where i
[37:14] failed in one way
[37:17] god's provided way listen church
[37:22] a body was brought into being
[37:29] a body was brought into being
[37:36] it was not eternal because it had a
[37:38] beginning
[37:41] you think about that you think about
[37:43] these words that we use a lot of times
[37:46] that the prophet says like that that
[37:48] that he was the fullness of the godhead
[37:50] bodily and things they can read the
[37:51] bible because the bible said it we read
[37:53] you a couple of quotes
[37:55] you can read the bible that says he's
[37:56] the fullness of the godhead bodily
[37:58] all right but what did we think about
[38:00] that as baptist
[38:01] methodist presbyterian pentecostals et
[38:04] cetera
[38:04] what do we think about it i don't see
[38:06] how that could be
[38:09] oh you say but i believe that then well
[38:12] what's our trouble now
[38:18] he didn't change
[38:22] but you say well i i think that he's he
[38:24] might be the second person
[38:26] or the third but he's not all of it well
[38:29] then where are you going
[38:31] where's your bible what are you talking
[38:32] about
[38:35] see you're listening to the devil's
[38:37] light and then you go to the people of
[38:39] this message
[38:41] and the preachers of this message are
[38:42] preaching
[38:44] a doctrinal issue just about that way
[38:46] that he wasn't god till the river jordan
[38:50] well you well brother dale you just said
[38:51] wanna go did you win the full
[38:53] there's a lot of difference in fullness
[38:54] and what it is
[38:57] what i'm saying that he's was not the
[38:58] fullness to the river jordan
[39:00] was he couldn't make manifest he
[39:02] couldn't die for your sins as a baby
[39:04] he couldn't pay the price as a child he
[39:05] couldn't do those things he had to wait
[39:07] till he come to that anointing came on
[39:09] him on the river jordan
[39:10] and when the anointing came on him then
[39:11] there he was the fullness of the godhead
[39:14] bodily
[39:18] he said well what was he for then he was
[39:19] god almighty in human flesh
[39:21] [Music]
[39:24] but he was not to that position that he
[39:26] wanted to be
[39:29] that anointing would come on and that's
[39:31] why they couldn't kill him
[39:35] the prophet said the anointing left him
[39:39] it had to leave him you couldn't kill
[39:42] him
[39:45] see that body was made for the purpose
[39:48] of death yes
[39:52] he said well you mean god died no god
[39:55] the
[39:56] eternal elohim self-existing all-knowing
[39:59] wise god didn't die
[40:02] but the body was capable and did die for
[40:05] our sins
[40:07] but while he was here in this world that
[40:10] was his tabernacle
[40:14] that was his tabernacle while he was
[40:16] dwelling here in this world
[40:20] now after his tabernacle
[40:24] was completely finished now we're his
[40:27] tabernacle
[40:28] is any problem with that we are now his
[40:31] tabernacle
[40:32] if not where is he at
[40:35] well he's over yonder now this dude no
[40:37] no no
[40:38] he's got to have it that's why when you
[40:40] read that scripture it says a body thou
[40:42] has prepared me
[40:43] we ain't going to get there with this
[40:45] but we're going to read where the
[40:46] prophet says
[40:47] that you are the body
[40:52] that god now dwells in
[40:56] are we going to believe it or are we
[40:59] going to just go
[41:00] watch what he says on this one go to the
[41:02] next one
[41:04] on the message called the paradox
[41:09] he said god was a paradox why because
[41:11] it's just impossible to be what
[41:13] what he wound up being how could how
[41:16] could
[41:17] how god could become man to die
[41:21] god life eternal life
[41:24] couldn't become god's natural life to
[41:27] die
[41:29] listen then to save man to bring them
[41:32] back
[41:32] to eternal life he couldn't come the
[41:35] eternal god
[41:36] couldn't step down and become just flesh
[41:40] you know i mean become just man he had
[41:43] to
[41:44] be able to condescend
[41:47] he came himself let me put where the
[41:50] prophet said it
[41:51] he said he never sent a son
[41:55] he came himself he stepped down into
[41:58] human flesh
[42:01] there was no way they could kill that
[42:03] human flesh till that anointing left
[42:05] that body
[42:07] then once it left they could kill the
[42:09] body why because he would be willingly
[42:11] giving it up
[42:13] all right so listen to what he's saying
[42:17] that was a paradox how that the great
[42:19] god that filled all space and all
[42:21] eternity
[42:22] could come down and be a man in order to
[42:25] die
[42:25] to save his own creation
[42:29] that enough let him read how god became
[42:32] one of his own creation
[42:34] to save because he created his own body
[42:38] jehovah the father dwelt in his fullness
[42:41] in jesus christ his son
[42:44] jesus was the body of god god was re
[42:48] represented in the tabernacle of the
[42:50] flesh of jesus christ
[42:52] and how that that one of that filled all
[42:55] space
[42:56] and all eternity become one man
[43:00] amen you see what i mean
[43:03] and that god could do that to die and
[43:06] all
[43:06] that was a paradox in itself
[43:10] how he could make himself that way in
[43:13] order to suffer death
[43:15] for the whole human race he had to
[43:18] exit the body you say well what happened
[43:21] to him
[43:22] he had to exit the body
[43:25] the god that stepped into the body as a
[43:28] baby
[43:31] right as a baby he stepped into a human
[43:34] body
[43:35] all right that one day that god had to
[43:38] exit that body
[43:39] to let that body pay the price that's
[43:41] right
[43:44] you say yeah but brother dale's brother
[43:46] branham we used the word son of god a
[43:47] lot amen
[43:49] we just read one or he called him the
[43:52] son of god but he don't call him god the
[43:55] son
[43:59] right he called him son of god because
[44:02] that's what he was
[44:03] god was in christ reconciling the world
[44:07] god came down and stepped into that
[44:09] human vessel
[44:13] all right see now i don't mind preaching
[44:15] it and letting you ask questions
[44:18] i don't mean to know say i know
[44:19] everything but i know one thing for sure
[44:21] when we get to glory
[44:24] you ain't going to see a father in a
[44:26] cloud
[44:27] and a puff into this or that or the
[44:29] other you're going to see
[44:31] the lord jesus christ
[44:34] standing there in the human body
[44:37] that he dwelt on earth in and he will
[44:41] never again leave that body
[44:44] [Music]
[44:46] there's no way to separate all we got to
[44:50] do is find out how we can come into the
[44:52] places
[44:53] of being his body here now because he
[44:56] needs a body
[45:01] did the prophet say it we gave it the
[45:02] other way where brought around said
[45:04] that god is not complete without you
[45:09] he's not complete without his offspring
[45:14] that's his children
[45:17] we were the offspring according to the
[45:19] book of acts you know
[45:20] when paul said you know the mars hill
[45:24] he said when i come along i found in the
[45:26] description i talked to the unknown god
[45:27] he said he's the one i want to talk to
[45:29] you about
[45:32] he said i want to tell you about him
[45:35] you ever thought about it now listen i'm
[45:37] going to say something never
[45:39] let me set this away before you won't
[45:40] forget it he's got to call you before
[45:43] you can come right
[45:44] now that's that scripture he's got to
[45:46] call you before you can come
[45:47] okay keep that in your mind and don't
[45:49] lose that point
[45:50] he's got to call you okay now you tell
[45:53] me that you walk up like paul
[45:55] and you walk up on mars hill and they
[45:57] got insignias to every kind of a god
[46:00] could be thought of and he looks over
[46:01] and he sees one and says to the unknown
[46:03] god
[46:04] he said they don't know nothing about
[46:07] him
[46:08] so i'll just use that i'll use that
[46:13] he didn't say god was sitting there he
[46:15] didn't say that was god
[46:16] he said i'm going to use their
[46:18] illustration
[46:20] and he preached jesus christ
[46:23] now you think about it somebody just
[46:26] walk up to you on the street somewhere
[46:28] that will talk to you about jesus christ
[46:31] well now in america we basically
[46:33] everybody's heard the name
[46:34] but what about a foreign country where
[46:36] they ain't even never heard of a name
[46:37] jesus
[46:38] and you're going to talk to them about
[46:40] jesus
[46:44] he ain't gonna do you no good if god
[46:45] ain't calling
[46:48] did you get it ain't gonna do you no
[46:49] good unless god's calling him first
[46:53] when he puts on your burden on your
[46:54] heart to you go talk to somebody
[46:56] you go because that means he's working
[47:00] on both ends
[47:01] he's calling he'll take care of but you
[47:04] just think about it
[47:05] you think about just walk down the
[47:06] street and here's a bunch of old drunks
[47:08] and
[47:08] kooks and everything in the world and he
[47:10] said i want to talk to you all about
[47:11] jesus christ
[47:13] you know what go ahead talk to me
[47:16] we don't know nothing about no jesus
[47:17] christ
[47:21] well you just pass on then but a runner
[47:24] said you know right real quick that the
[47:25] predestination is off
[47:28] so you just go on you get gone okay
[47:31] let's read some more
[47:33] watch the reading now
[47:36] here we go to a court trial
[47:40] roll it on up till we get to there where
[47:41] we save time
[47:43] there's no three or four gods there's
[47:46] only one god
[47:48] there is three attributes of god father
[47:50] son and holy ghost
[47:52] but there are not three gods that's
[47:54] heathen see there is only one god
[47:57] and that attributes god the father was
[48:01] in the wilderness as a pillar of fire
[48:04] old testament right
[48:06] all right god the son
[48:10] then god the father created the body
[48:13] which was god the son and lived in the
[48:16] son
[48:17] see god was in christ reconciling the
[48:19] world to himself
[48:21] what'd he do he created a body and now
[48:24] look jesus said i came from god
[48:26] and i returned to god after his death
[48:28] birth and resurrection he'll send it
[48:29] back
[48:30] think about it
[48:34] without a body god is not complete
[48:43] that's the way he chose it that's why he
[48:46] made it
[48:47] he designed it that way
[48:50] but he's got a body he had a body
[48:54] oh god was he poured into christ he had
[48:57] a body see then when you
[49:02] would be looking at him and see him as i
[49:04] said standing there in glory
[49:06] you're not going to see a father over
[49:07] here and a son over here under the holy
[49:09] ghost over here
[49:10] no you're going to see jesus
[49:15] but you're going to know who he is
[49:20] see you won't be wondering then whether
[49:23] a trinity's right or this is right or
[49:25] that's right
[49:26] you'll know that none of those things
[49:27] are right
[49:30] you're going to see him as he is the
[49:33] bible says he'll have a body like unto
[49:35] his glorious body
[49:37] all right so then that means if he's got
[49:39] an eternal body in the resurrection
[49:42] he went into eternity body spirit soul
[49:44] everything
[49:45] all right then here we got to go that
[49:46] way
[49:49] our body is going to be made eternal one
[49:51] day
[49:54] but remember it's his body
[49:57] listen to what i'm getting to and just
[49:59] remember
[50:01] there's no way no i know i make strong
[50:04] statements and
[50:06] you say well i don't know there's no way
[50:11] that god can operate
[50:14] amen without you
[50:19] he chose it that way
[50:24] he made the way yes you didn't
[50:27] you didn't make the choice you never
[50:29] sought god
[50:31] that's right it's god seeking you like
[50:33] i'm saying how did you walk up to a
[50:34] whole crowd of people
[50:35] if god don't come down in that crowd and
[50:38] quicken somebody's heart to lead them to
[50:40] him
[50:40] then it's going to go on off
[50:44] me but if he comes down and
[50:47] says brother mo you say lord give him
[50:50] that little tug
[50:51] i look i used to listen to him say that
[50:53] and lord there ain't no better way to
[50:55] say it
[50:57] just give them a little tug on their
[51:00] heart
[51:02] because that's going to lead you to the
[51:04] rest of it right
[51:07] but you understand i'm trying to get you
[51:08] to see how that there's a possibility
[51:12] maybe wrong words to use i'm sorry a
[51:15] possibility
[51:17] of the fact that god can make manifest
[51:20] himself in this world as the great
[51:23] eternal i
[51:24] am step down into human flesh
[51:30] manifest himself through all of those
[51:32] things and ways and coming forth
[51:34] and then come down to an end time
[51:38] to find his perfect way he wanted it
[51:45] right then he's happy about that what
[51:48] about me and you
[51:49] are we happy go ahead to number four
[51:57] the revelation of jesus christ the
[51:58] church age will the bible teaches that
[52:00] god was in christ
[52:02] the body was jesus now listen
[52:08] the body was jesus
[52:12] any problem
[52:15] well then what's the rest all right
[52:17] listen the body was jesus in him dwelt
[52:19] all the fullness of the godhead bodily
[52:21] nothing can be plainer than that mystery
[52:24] yes
[52:25] but actual truth it can't be plainer so
[52:28] if he wasn't three people then
[52:30] he can't be three now one god
[52:33] and this same god was made manifest
[52:37] a flesh a body
[52:45] a body
[52:48] that he could step into
[52:53] now remember he had to step into a body
[52:55] in the beginning
[52:57] because he wound up being the genesis 1
[53:00] 26
[53:01] 27 man that says let us make man in our
[53:05] own image and
[53:07] so man was created spiritual being right
[53:11] in the image of god
[53:16] now if that is true
[53:21] then you realize all we need to change
[53:23] this body we're going to be right where
[53:24] we
[53:24] put them would have been if this body
[53:26] can get changed we're going to be right
[53:28] where we should have been to start with
[53:30] amen
[53:34] right back to where we should have been
[53:36] to start with
[53:41] it's all possible by him stepping into a
[53:43] body
[53:45] to be able to release that life because
[53:48] there was no way to kill him
[53:50] when he was walking as almighty god to
[53:53] great jehovah et cetera
[53:54] there was no way to kill him
[53:59] don't you think the devil would have
[54:00] sure liked to have done it
[54:02] but there's no way
[54:07] but see then when he stepped into flesh
[54:09] satan says
[54:10] i got to change
[54:14] i'm going after that body well i like
[54:17] the way brother harris said it because
[54:19] he was dealing with anointing
[54:21] but i can just go into even in the
[54:22] natural but i mean he always had his way
[54:24] of saying things
[54:25] and he'd say that old devil he said he
[54:27] was dumb
[54:28] he said he ordered he ordered this went
[54:30] on somewhere else and not said nothing
[54:31] to the lord jesus
[54:33] he said because that way he just had one
[54:34] to fight
[54:36] he just had one christ to fight you
[54:39] remember him how he used to make that
[54:41] stuff
[54:41] he said by doing it he said there was
[54:43] 120 into first whack
[54:45] and then 3 000 outside the next next
[54:48] point
[54:49] now you've got all these christ
[54:52] all these jesuses that he's fighting
[54:55] against that he'd been better off to let
[54:57] it win
[54:59] but he didn't have sense enough he still
[55:00] thinks he can whip it
[55:04] i know what these guys do i i i never
[55:07] went through karates or nothing like
[55:09] that
[55:09] but see they say well oh you're never
[55:11] supposed to fight your mentor
[55:14] baloney that's the guy you're gonna try
[55:17] to whip because you can whip him you're
[55:19] greater than all the rest
[55:22] don't tell me stuff like that i used to
[55:25] tell brother harris and the brothers
[55:27] don't tell me that that you'd bow down
[55:30] to your mentor and not fight him
[55:32] [Music]
[55:33] that's the guy you're going after
[55:37] but listen a body
[55:43] you mean brother dale do you believe
[55:46] that god's got a body
[55:50] yeah yeah
[55:54] i believe he has a body i believe he has
[55:57] a place to dwell he dwells in that body
[56:04] and he dwelt in that body i'm going to
[56:07] read some more of these but we're going
[56:08] to get on over to the back of these
[56:10] where it comes to the body being you
[56:14] see he's never been without a body since
[56:17] he
[56:17] developed it in the garden however where
[56:20] you know jesus come forth as a natural
[56:21] baby
[56:22] that brought a body he's never been
[56:25] without a body since then
[56:30] as bad as we are he still loves it
[56:36] right
[56:39] does he still put up with us
[56:45] did you still hear a prayer sometimes
[56:49] even though we're a bunch of garbage
[56:55] you see he ain't looking at the garbage
[56:56] he's looking at what he's what he said
[56:57] he's going to do
[57:00] he said he's going to bring a body and
[57:03] that's the way he's doing
[57:04] but it's going to finalize in the bride
[57:06] we'll get to that later go ahead number
[57:10] five
[57:13] the darkest hour then jesus comes he's
[57:16] talking about
[57:17] the woman touching the lord jesus and
[57:19] verse are coming out she pulled from him
[57:21] virtue through that human body of his
[57:24] because he was just a man
[57:27] born of a woman but his father was god
[57:32] but in his body he was a man
[57:36] in his spirit he was god so
[57:39] god was in christ and the woman pulling
[57:41] that virtue
[57:42] believe it but are you listening born of
[57:46] a woman
[57:46] but his father was god in his body he
[57:49] was a man
[57:54] in his spirit he was god
[58:00] see a body
[58:04] a human body a 16 element body
[58:09] the difference between that the prophet
[58:11] has said in your body
[58:12] he said his body was virgin born
[58:15] he said yours is not
[58:21] because he was a body i believe he could
[58:22] have given blood transfusion
[58:25] right of course there would have been
[58:26] nobody in the world had that type of
[58:28] blood
[58:29] i'm honest i believe he was the blood of
[58:31] god
[58:32] i can't believe i can prove that if
[58:34] you've got about two or three hours
[58:36] with some notes and i believe i can
[58:37] prove that that was the blood of god
[58:40] from what your prophet had to say okay
[58:43] go ahead let's go to the next one let's
[58:46] get a few more
[58:49] this is from the fruit shreveport
[58:55] now listen god was in his tabernacle
[58:59] the the son of god we'll say well now
[59:03] how could he be
[59:04] god and be a son of god what are you
[59:12] you have the new birth
[59:16] then you're a son of god you're a child
[59:19] of god
[59:23] you're god in another form called a son
[59:28] same as he is what i'm trying to get you
[59:31] to see is his next message or two
[59:33] is to try to get you to see whatever
[59:35] deals with him is going to deal with you
[59:38] whatever it is for him to come to a
[59:40] place it's going to
[59:41] mean you're going to come to that place
[59:47] because we are the people remember
[59:49] couldn't do it in luther
[59:52] they didn't have enough word couldn't do
[59:54] it in wesley
[59:56] couldn't do it at zeus street pentecost
[59:59] you've got to have malachi 4.
[1:00:02] you've got to have luke 17 30 revelation
[1:00:04] 10 7 etc
[1:00:05] you got to have all of that to come to
[1:00:07] the bases where you can talk about
[1:00:09] fullness of the godhead bodily
[1:00:11] did you ever hear anybody i'm asking you
[1:00:13] honestly to say
[1:00:14] have you ever heard anybody outside of
[1:00:16] brother branham would preach the godhead
[1:00:18] in the bride
[1:00:22] i haven't i don't know
[1:00:27] goes where is he at all right listen
[1:00:30] the son of god which was jesus was the
[1:00:33] flesh of god
[1:00:36] the flesh of god
[1:00:41] he was where the holy spirit
[1:00:45] dwelt in flesh
[1:00:48] he was the flesh of god
[1:00:52] he was hungry he had to eat he had to do
[1:00:55] he had sleep he had
[1:00:56] he was a a human being
[1:01:01] well i always thought he was a son of
[1:01:03] god and made him some kind of a special
[1:01:04] type of a god or something well just get
[1:01:06] rid of them kind of
[1:01:08] ideas because that don't fit because
[1:01:09] that goes into trinitarianisms and
[1:01:11] things and that don't work
[1:01:14] listen what he's saying the son of god
[1:01:17] which was jesus was the flesh of god
[1:01:19] a tabernacle that god dwelt in here on
[1:01:22] the earth
[1:01:23] and now that was that was christ and god
[1:01:25] became
[1:01:26] came united see christ and god became
[1:01:29] united
[1:01:29] and that's the way god could be seen no
[1:01:32] man has seen the father
[1:01:34] at any time but the only begotten son
[1:01:37] has declared him see in other words
[1:01:41] god was in christ showing his act
[1:01:44] his attitude towards
[1:01:47] the people the and what he
[1:01:51] what he was what god was he was
[1:01:54] expressing himself through jesus
[1:01:56] his son see as he dwelt
[1:02:00] in him making jesus and god jesus being
[1:02:03] the tabernacle
[1:02:06] that god was dwelling in here
[1:02:09] on earth a body has thou prepared me
[1:02:14] god dwelt in jesus christ and that made
[1:02:17] the father
[1:02:18] and the son united together now and
[1:02:21] become
[1:02:22] the now notice now what was
[1:02:26] in christ was in was the fullness
[1:02:29] of the spirit the entire fullness of god
[1:02:33] god gave christ the spirit without
[1:02:36] measure
[1:02:38] please give it like to me and you you
[1:02:40] can we get it by measure
[1:02:42] see he was emmanuel
[1:02:46] can you i'm just serious here i've been
[1:02:49] thinking about these things for months
[1:02:50] and well many
[1:02:51] really for years trying to preach on one
[1:02:54] god
[1:02:56] can you just believe it
[1:03:00] that he was almighty god in human flesh
[1:03:05] he was the tabernacle he was the thing
[1:03:09] that he said
[1:03:11] buildings i don't want what is that in
[1:03:13] the psalms i think
[1:03:15] because there's two of them one of
[1:03:16] them's in hebrews i think there wasn't
[1:03:17] songs
[1:03:18] neither that or isaiah but but he he
[1:03:20] didn't want to dwell in temples made by
[1:03:22] man's hands
[1:03:26] he wanted to dwell in the people
[1:03:32] isn't that wonderful to think one day
[1:03:36] we'll be able to walk with him through
[1:03:38] the garden
[1:03:40] we'll be able to fellowship with him
[1:03:44] we'll be able to praise him in worship
[1:03:49] everything will be so perfect won't it
[1:03:50] be something let's get another one
[1:03:56] okay go ahead to number
[1:04:00] seven i guess now god gave christ the
[1:04:04] spirit without measure is that right the
[1:04:06] fullness of
[1:04:07] god was in christ he was god emmanuel he
[1:04:10] knows there's no doubt in our minds or
[1:04:12] the thing
[1:04:12] i said yesterday the whole ocean is full
[1:04:15] you know water like a spoonful out of it
[1:04:17] we know all that
[1:04:18] come on up let's save time but in christ
[1:04:21] was the fullness of god
[1:04:23] we have it by measure he had it without
[1:04:26] measure
[1:04:27] the bible says see without measure no
[1:04:29] way
[1:04:30] he's he's just limited unlimited
[1:04:34] he had the spirit of god and and he
[1:04:37] comes through
[1:04:37] he wanted to use his spirit that was
[1:04:40] in a man the corporal body
[1:04:44] called jesus which was his dwelling
[1:04:47] place the body
[1:04:48] is a tabernacle god was dwelling in a
[1:04:52] tabernacle
[1:04:55] he was pleased to dwell there the
[1:04:57] scripture says
[1:05:00] right god was pleased to dwell in that
[1:05:03] tabernacle
[1:05:04] what about when he said it about me and
[1:05:06] you
[1:05:08] now you may not believe this but i do i
[1:05:10] believe the day he gave you the new
[1:05:12] birth
[1:05:13] he said i'm pleased to dwell in ray
[1:05:15] gabriel
[1:05:17] nobody else might not be pleased for
[1:05:19] these days
[1:05:20] but i'm pleased well you know we got
[1:05:24] these problems with these troubles that
[1:05:25] don't have nothing to do with it
[1:05:29] because he made us a covenant in abraham
[1:05:31] of everything being unconditional
[1:05:34] well then i can just live like a devil
[1:05:36] and get by now just don't try it
[1:05:40] you're gonna wind up in trouble don't
[1:05:41] try it you're gonna wind up wishing
[1:05:44] you hadn't tried it so the best thing to
[1:05:47] do is just be yourself and just be what
[1:05:49] you are and just be happy
[1:05:54] you say yeah but what about this this
[1:05:56] thing here what about this what about
[1:05:57] this
[1:05:58] money what about all these things so
[1:06:02] what
[1:06:04] so what you're going to eat your money
[1:06:09] that was life and talking about it the
[1:06:10] other day but somebody there said what
[1:06:12] are you going to do when you need it
[1:06:13] you're going to take out one of them
[1:06:14] silver dollars or
[1:06:15] scrape off some silver and say that'll
[1:06:17] pay that much
[1:06:20] no you're going to give the whole silver
[1:06:22] dollar
[1:06:24] you know that'd be the only way you get
[1:06:25] to pay for anything
[1:06:27] but you see church we're not making
[1:06:28] light of nobody we're all just do
[1:06:30] we do our things but yet still we need
[1:06:34] to be
[1:06:35] all time thinking about what he wants
[1:06:37] done
[1:06:40] he wants to dwell in you
[1:06:45] oh brother al canardi used to tell me so
[1:06:47] brother dale i
[1:06:48] i woke up last night at three o'clock i
[1:06:50] said
[1:06:52] he said i just got up brow said you pray
[1:06:54] for me yeah i said
[1:06:56] lord wake him up two o'clock
[1:07:01] i wanted him to wake him up earlier
[1:07:03] where he could pray for me
[1:07:05] because i want somebody to pray for me
[1:07:08] and when i was laying up there in that
[1:07:10] hospital and everything you know for
[1:07:11] five days and thinking what in the world
[1:07:13] am i doing
[1:07:14] here and when am i going to get out well
[1:07:15] then the word would come through said
[1:07:16] everybody's praying for you around the
[1:07:18] world we got you on the internet here we
[1:07:20] got you there
[1:07:20] we got you on this we got you on that i
[1:07:22] said thank you lord
[1:07:24] thank you lord we'll we're gonna make it
[1:07:26] through
[1:07:28] well we made it
[1:07:32] see but do you understand what i'm
[1:07:34] trying to get at
[1:07:36] let me read a couple more because i know
[1:07:38] i ain't going to be able to get to it
[1:07:39] but i want you to think
[1:07:41] until maybe next sunday
[1:07:44] whatever i want you to think about
[1:07:49] what brother random is saying i believe
[1:07:53] that in his body was a man
[1:08:00] he was born of a woman
[1:08:04] just like us but his
[1:08:08] blood was not our blood you know from a
[1:08:11] woman
[1:08:12] it was of god
[1:08:15] his soul he was god
[1:08:20] you just think walking on the shores of
[1:08:22] galilee was almighty
[1:08:24] god in a human vessel
[1:08:31] but they could never touch him
[1:08:35] until that anointing left in me could
[1:08:37] not be touched
[1:08:39] well i happen to know where there's a
[1:08:41] quote says that
[1:08:45] the anointing is on the bride
[1:08:48] the fullness of the godhead bodily is in
[1:08:51] the bride
[1:08:52] i happen to know where those are at and
[1:08:54] i you know what i happen to believe
[1:08:57] we say well i believe this that and the
[1:08:59] other what the prophet said well why not
[1:09:00] believe all he said
[1:09:06] for just a minute now god tabernacled
[1:09:10] as i said he didn't want to sit back
[1:09:12] here in a building
[1:09:15] and you come in and worship him and do
[1:09:17] he didn't want you to run it up and down
[1:09:19] he wanted you just to be his children
[1:09:23] what about being a child of god
[1:09:32] what about being a child of almighty god
[1:09:37] a human being capable of being a child
[1:09:41] of god
[1:09:44] well we've got to remember he started
[1:09:46] off becoming a child of god
[1:09:51] he said but i don't understand how that
[1:09:52] you can say that he was god in flesh
[1:09:55] well i'd like you to explain how it
[1:09:57] could be any other way
[1:10:01] he was almighty god in human flesh
[1:10:07] and there was no way to touch him until
[1:10:09] that anointing
[1:10:10] left him i believe your prophet said it
[1:10:14] like this
[1:10:15] after the door of the gentile church is
[1:10:17] closed
[1:10:19] god will anoint a brighter church then
[1:10:23] and said he'll do what theologists or
[1:10:26] theologians have tried to do in 2000
[1:10:29] years in other words he said but he's
[1:10:31] doing it now
[1:10:37] he's pouring in his self you say yeah we
[1:10:40] got the new birth yeah but there's a
[1:10:41] whole lot more to be poured in look at
[1:10:43] it
[1:10:44] statue of perfect man faith virtue
[1:10:45] knowledge temperatures go to
[1:10:47] brother reynolds said that's the man god
[1:10:48] wants to live in i've got the quotes
[1:10:50] laying right here
[1:10:53] that's the man god wants to live in is
[1:10:56] the stature of a perfect man
[1:11:01] well i just don't see how we can do it
[1:11:02] now the problem is is you're doubting
[1:11:04] what that god can do it
[1:11:07] don't doubt him just accept it
[1:11:12] you know accept him
[1:11:17] your children just accept the lord jesus
[1:11:19] christ as your savior
[1:11:23] just say lord help me come in and save
[1:11:26] me
[1:11:29] just save my soul lord i want to be i
[1:11:32] want to be right
[1:11:35] and see then he'll take care of a lot of
[1:11:38] things
[1:11:40] i believe that jesus is the son of god
[1:11:45] now i believe the prophet is right when
[1:11:48] he said
[1:11:50] god didn't send a second person
[1:11:53] he came himself
[1:11:57] so as a son of god he just came down
[1:11:59] that great eternal
[1:12:01] step right in that body
[1:12:05] is not that exactly what he done
[1:12:09] in the garden with adam
[1:12:13] he breathed into his nostrils the breath
[1:12:16] of eternal life
[1:12:18] blasphemous names and he became
[1:12:21] a son of god with eternal life
[1:12:26] that's why you couldn't kill him you
[1:12:28] couldn't kill adam
[1:12:32] he was a child of god
[1:12:35] we talk about that sarah he couldn't
[1:12:37] kill sarah why because she was in
[1:12:39] i mean in abraham
[1:12:43] well why can't you think that we was in
[1:12:44] him
[1:12:47] he can't do anything to be in you until
[1:12:48] he's through until he's through with us
[1:12:50] why are you worried about these things
[1:12:52] or no
[1:12:55] no concerned yeah because we're human
[1:12:58] right okay no problem concerned
[1:13:03] mainly concerned with the bases
[1:13:04] wondering what's going to take place
[1:13:10] but we're being told and set in the
[1:13:12] stages even to what
[1:13:14] that we've got the the woman in the
[1:13:17] white house
[1:13:18] your prophet saw that 50 years ago or
[1:13:22] something
[1:13:23] but it's finally come to pies
[1:13:26] well i don't have no problems with her
[1:13:30] i wouldn't shoot her
[1:13:33] i would have no problems with her
[1:13:38] i'd talk to her about the lord if i
[1:13:39] could
[1:13:41] you know but you understand see a body
[1:13:47] 2 000 years ago was produced by virgin
[1:13:50] birth
[1:13:53] god didn't send a son
[1:13:57] to dwell in a son that would make a son
[1:14:02] no he come and stepped into the body
[1:14:05] and that's why he's called the son of
[1:14:06] god
[1:14:08] because he stepped into the body
[1:14:12] he called the son of god because he was
[1:14:14] another person
[1:14:16] you're going back to trinitarianism
[1:14:19] he stepped into that body
[1:14:25] and god said i'm pleased to dwell hear
[1:14:28] you him i thought we was looking forward
[1:14:30] to those things
[1:14:32] i thought those were the things the
[1:14:33] prophet told us would be coming
[1:14:40] brother dale i just you just you've
[1:14:42] always done it you've always tried to
[1:14:44] make everything so far away i ain't
[1:14:46] never made nothing far away
[1:14:47] i've made it too close again i never
[1:14:50] tried to preach nothing far away
[1:14:53] and i preached in 1969 in athens georgia
[1:14:56] that the bride of jesus christ would be
[1:14:59] the son of man
[1:15:02] in the last days i can still produce
[1:15:06] those quotes because they're written in
[1:15:07] the front of my bible
[1:15:10] i wasn't telling nobody what i thought
[1:15:13] i was telling people what the prophet
[1:15:15] said
[1:15:16] right you know that he can't be a son
[1:15:21] he ever noticed this statement that
[1:15:22] wrote around said that god couldn't be a
[1:15:24] son without the son of man
[1:15:29] you don't that statement
[1:15:32] couldn't be a son without son of man
[1:15:35] that would make him a father you realize
[1:15:39] that he created me in you
[1:15:42] a new creation in the new birth
[1:15:46] not created us anything else but a new
[1:15:47] creation and a new birth
[1:15:49] makes you and us even all of us are
[1:15:51] children of god
[1:15:55] the son of man is the word made flesh
[1:16:01] the bride will be the word made flesh
[1:16:07] but do we believe it
[1:16:10] do we believe it can we accept it that
[1:16:14] we are the children of god
[1:16:15] can we accept as paul said in mars hill
[1:16:18] he said some of your poets and all this
[1:16:20] said that we are the offspring of god
[1:16:22] he said that's right he said that's what
[1:16:25] we are.
[1:16:26] and when they said to jesus he said
[1:16:27] something he says what are you doing
[1:16:29] you're killing me for what i said we're
[1:16:31] killing you because you're a man making
[1:16:32] yourself a god
[1:16:34] he said is that not what your word says
[1:16:37] you call them sons that know
[1:16:38] the word comes to and said all i've ever
[1:16:42] done is brought you the word
[1:16:46] right
[1:16:49] think on these things
[1:16:55] think about what god has made you and me
[1:17:01] it is he that hath made us and not we
[1:17:03] ourselves
[1:17:04] we didn't have anything to do with it we
[1:17:06] didn't call ourselves we didn't
[1:17:07] guide ourselves it was him guiding us
[1:17:11] you say yeah but brother dale i cried i
[1:17:12] prayed i saw god
[1:17:14] yeah that was a natural that's all right
[1:17:18] i could do it but it was really him
[1:17:20] searching for you
[1:17:22] because the bible says the goodness of
[1:17:25] god
[1:17:26] leadeth us to repentance
[1:17:30] so if you want any repentance you've got
[1:17:31] to get the goodness of god the leading
[1:17:33] of god to you and i
[1:17:35] the drawing the pulling that's right
[1:17:39] come on musician what do we got
[1:17:44] jesus the flesh
[1:17:47] was a man
[1:17:52] inside of that man was an eternal god
[1:18:05] what is it in you
[1:18:09] like i've always tried to get you to see
[1:18:10] we talk about the tree of life being in
[1:18:12] the garden
[1:18:13] oh wonderful what a sin hadn't entered
[1:18:15] the picture we went to the tree of life
[1:18:17] and been made eternal halls through
[1:18:20] because our soul wasn't eternal i mean
[1:18:22] our souls are
[1:18:23] adam's souls eternal adam and eve but
[1:18:25] not us
[1:18:28] and see what do you think is taking
[1:18:31] place now
[1:18:32] you receive the new birth your soul is
[1:18:36] made eternal
[1:18:37] you're waiting the redemption of the
[1:18:38] body and he's working through the spirit
[1:18:41] realm of memory reason conscious
[1:18:43] affections et cetera
[1:18:45] through the stature of a perfect man
[1:18:46] faith virtue knowledge temperature
[1:18:48] through adoption through all of these
[1:18:50] things that the prophet has taught us
[1:18:55] but what we do is like a brother told me
[1:18:57] one day
[1:18:59] we were talking about statue of perfect
[1:19:01] man and adoption
[1:19:03] he said now if i cross it up which one
[1:19:07] he used but he said
[1:19:08] that that adoption is simple we said
[1:19:12] that statue of perfect man is deep
[1:19:16] i just walked away
[1:19:20] it's the same thing the stature of a
[1:19:22] perfect man is the message of adoption
[1:19:26] but yet he thought that answered the
[1:19:28] question
[1:19:30] no it just showed how far off we had
[1:19:32] missed it
[1:19:35] the seals
[1:19:38] is for the bringing these things into
[1:19:39] you and i there
[1:19:42] the opening of god's word all the way
[1:19:43] through what do we got brother go ahead
[1:19:45] let's stand
[1:19:46] let's sing that little section we're
