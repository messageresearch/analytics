done it to me so I'm counting on that that you've done it to him that you've done it to me so and I believe you get reward for that Isaiah chapter 60 I'd like to read verse one and verse two says arise Shine for the light is come and the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee for for Behold The Darkness shall cover the Earth and gross Darkness the people but the Lord shall rise upon thee and His glory shall be seen upon thee let us pray almighty God what can we say father as mere mortals father just reading these these precious words words that your prophet Isaiah spoke to us oh God our hearts just ignited Lord father to know in a time in the age that we live in father that we can arise and shine because th light has shine upon us Lord oh God we're so thankful tonight father for the message you've sent us father father we're so thankful for the eyes sa you've given us father to see father oh Lord we love you we thank you we we glorify you father I pray you'd do something special once again father for your children this afternoon father may they leave father a better Christian Lord father help me to leave a better Christian Lord father we want to lead better father and father we're counting on your word father that your word is going to go forth father and it's going to cut away the excess things in our life father and that father we'll be washed father and cleansed by Your Word this afternoon father and father we'll leave because we're better Christians because you've been here father youve ministered to each and every one of us father I pray that is as we send you

Thanksgiving father oh God we long to hear the words of your to you to speak to us Lord and father may we be like the children on the road to emus Lord as you departed from Lord they said oh did not our hearts burn within us as you spoke to us along the way father set our hearts on fire tonight father that we may leave this place father shining a brighter light father for the world is father in Gross Darkness but your children has light father and we thank you for that tonight Lord we ask you in Jesus Christ name amen and amen you may be seated says arise and shine for the glory for the light is come not just any light it says for thy light is come and the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee for Behold The Darkness shall cover the Earth and gross darkness of people but the Lord shall rise shall arise rise upon thee and His glory shall be seen upon thee boy I'm so thankful for that tonight I want to talk about amen a little thought tonight we see a lot of a lot of things going on and I want to make a little simple topic getting used to the dark we see that's where a lot of times we feel as Christians we get used to the dark you know we are not here to get used to the dark we're here to shine light in dark I like what the prophet of God said in the message the great Shining Light in 1957 in Jeffersonville Indiana he said as Isaiah said this people set in Gross Darkness but a great light has shined upon them well we can say that to us that this message is shine the great light on us it says Grant Lord that they that there this prophecy might be fulfilled today in these hearts who are longing for you that's my prayer this afternoon give to them that peace that passes all understanding and gives them a perfect satisfaction can you say that in your heart tonight that you have a perfect satisfaction that they have met you and have talked with you and offer to you their lives that's all he asks us to do is to be to offer our lives back to him a living sacrifice for Jesus Christ is it a perfect satisfaction to us have we offered our life have we talked to him have we come to the place to where we say Lord Whatever Whatever It Takes father that's what I'm willing to do if I have to subject if I have to Forfeit Sunshine for rain if I have to whatever I have to do Lord whatever it takes I like what the prophet of God said in another message called the former and the latter rain Phoenix AR 196 says and we see these fearful sights of coming earthquakes tidle waves Falling Away gross Darkness heav High minded lovers of pre lovers of pleasure he said now that's all for the world that's not for the bride that's a sign for us that we're going home he said but the church has another sign he said oh that blessed called out sign he promised that there would be a latter rain in the church the church spiritual we see that in this Darkest Hour that we live in that God has sent us a great light to be able to see you know you know the prophet of God once Illustrated the man he come over to another man come over to his house and he' went down a trail it was daytime then he got over there and he fellowship with the with the family for a while and he told me he said well I'm going to go back home it got dark and he said well we can't even see your house from over here how you going to be able to get back he said there's a trail that I can follow seeing Jesus left a trail for us to follow the bloody Footprints of Jesus Christ and we have a trail to follow and I'm so thankful this afternoon that we have that trail to fall brother said it's The Darkest Hour the cooling off of the church have you ever noticed that it it's the coldest time and the coldest when when it gets the coldest is when it's dark the record temperatures are set at night not in the day right because the sunlight produces heat and see we see that Satan is trying to breathe his cold breath on us as Christians trying to get us relaxed and satisfied in the surrounding and the situations we're in right he's trying to get us to get would we like to say it maybe this way tonight that he's trying to get us to get used to the dark and we see that the people the church World nominal and the people around the world they got so used to the dark that they let a woman a woman raise up and and Proclaim that she didn't want her child to have to be subject to prayer in the school anymore so what did the nominal Church world do when they had decided when they had decided to to to heed down and to let people do what they wanted to do and they didn't fight against it they just got used to the dark they said well if she don't want it that's all right with us let's don't make a big trouble but let me tell you when you do that then you compromise with the devil lot of times around the message we see when people say well you know you know you know it don't really mean that it don't this and you that's just compromising that's getting used to we don't have to take a compromise we don't have to take some man's word we don't have to take some man's education or some man's ideas we can take the pure unadulterated word for this hour and apply it to our lives we can live a Victorious Life we don't have to cool off that's right I believe that's what's wrong with we sat around so long and we we don't we don't do what we should do but the prophet God said you want to get closer to God then read your Bible and pray amen and I believe brother said that's a shame said look at look at John Wesley's mother said she had all raised all those children and still Washed by hand and and had you know to use the wash TB on and raised those children and Tau them about God and said now we got washing machines we've got drives we've got cars we've got everything we've got microwaves and we're getting lazier that's right amen see that Satan bringing in soft living to get us to the place to where we're getting used to the dark but it's time for me and you as Christians to raise up against that Spirit of darkness and say his light has shined it's time for the bride to rise the glory of the Lord has shined Upon Us in this age not just any light the light of God has shined on us you ever notice when you're traveling down the road and right before when you're traveling and it starts getting dark a lot of times you fail to turn you you fail to turn your headlights on because why you got used to the dark you really didn't realize you didn't have them on see that's what the Satan wants us today traveling through this life that we live in he wants us to forget to turn the light on right Jesus is the light amen he is the way he is the truth amen and we need to apply this light that we've received in this hour to be able to make it back right we see they walk right in brother said they walk right in with their eyes just wide open as they can be stumbling in Gross Darkness it's not a natural blindness it's a spiritual blindness that they can't you can sit here and show them in the scripture baptism godhead serpent SE and they still can't see that's right but you can see it am he said blessed are your eyes blessed are your ears blessed is your heart cuz you're able to receive it that's right thank you but they can't receive it because they have no representation they hear it they recognize it but they can't act on it that's right they say I got that that can't be true brother said people who calling themselves we know that don't happen around here people calling themselves Christians women men smoking drinking going to cocktail parties wearing shorts bobbing their hair wearing makeup manicure he said what it's over what he said what manicure whatever that is over their face and walking right on walking right on don't have no fear I've never seen somebody you know they come out with this thing no fear but see another a plan Planet the scriptural way we don't have to fear that's right but they better begin to fear he said the fear of the Lord is the beginning of understanding wisdom that's right they don't fear him that's why they don't have the understanding we do see they're whistling through the graveyard thinking oh it's going to be okay but it's not going to be okay that's right they're fooling themselves they've been so polluted by Hollywood and all these things and they even think they got the Rapture down pack so they come out with Left Behind it's nothing like that right and that's all oh have you seen this have you seen that I said butn of garbage don't even line up to the word he said he'd come as a thief in the night what thief's going to broadcasting that's right he's not much of a thief right if a man told me he's going to break in my house I'd be sitting in there with a shotgun I'd be waiting on him I mean but see they don't even realize that it's all Hollywood see brother R said Satan changed his position he used to sit over there in Rome but now he's sitting in Hollywood he's got the minds of people's minds polluted he said the people are watching these things on TV it's training their mind to go through the tribulation oh my my goodness brothers and sisters we better be careful that's right we want our mind trained to go to the Rapture this message is training me for a rapture for in for in this message brother said is rapturing Faith this message is my train this message is my measuring stick brother said the flashing red light is the signals down he said his coming is at hand he said oh my Isaiah in chapter 60 he said in the second verse said Darkness shall cover the Earth and gross Darkness will cover the people he said that's exactly right didn't Jesus even tell him in his time he said you leaders are blind he said the blind lead the blind you all fall in ditch they're spiritually blind amen but we have eyes say I can go to the Rock I can go to the shepherd and he can give me some of that good oldfashioned Holy Ghost grease to rub in my eyes but said there's a spiritual cold on the church Satan has got that people's eyes so matted up they can't see right from wrong no more that's right they're satisfied but I'm not satisfied Brother Don my exceeding portion is in Christ not in this place not in this Earth but in Heavenly things in Christ Jesus right he said so many people are sincere called away in Creeds churches organizations having a form of godliness yes he said but deny the power thereof right he said one side has light and the other Darkness he said Darkness pressed upon the Gentile age we're living in the darkest age ever known to man but yet we're living in the most glorious age see how great God is he takes Satan's Satan's darkness and brings great glory to it right to himself he said because there has light has has shined arise Shake yourself off off and say Lord I have seen your light I'm willing I'm willing to walk in the light as you are the light Darkness everywhere on the Earth but the only thing that can separate Darkness separate the darkness is the light here's Darkness upon the Earth light and darkness has to separate and only one thing separates it that's the manifested word of God separates right amen separates it didn't say draw closer to or get adjusted to it amen say separated he said Darkness runs to the other side amen ain't you glad of that amen ain't you glad we serve a God and you you've never seen so many homosexuals claiming to be Christians I believe God can convert right I believe God don't reform them he transforms them you're a new creature not the same old person you was right and they say we're Christians never seen a time like we live in now s me everywhere that's right it's old preacher they lock you up for that I'm obligated to the truth right if I have to be locked up then lock me up you can't take Jesus from me hey I can rejoice in there just as good as I can anywhere else to think that he's found us worthy brother Aaron that's right to suffer for his name he suffered for mine and yours he became our sin that me and you might become his very righteousness we don't get have to get adjusted to it they say oh you know it's all right God loves everybody he loves The Sinner but he hates sin he'll never justify sin that's right he'll can cover it with the blood and take away that nature and that life away but he'll never conform to that he'll never get ajust when he said anytime God said it was an Abomination to do this or to do that it's always been and it always will be he said over in Malachi I'm the Lord thy God and I don't change but they're saying oh oh we got to make it a little softer I heard a Church of God preacher say one time he told my wife this and I want to use it I want to use it he said he said if I could just get the people in the church said I'd set up I'd set up Hast acts and banjos and get violins and stuff just to get the people in there what are we trying to do brother and said don't give them what they've already got give them what they ain't got Jesus Christ that's what they need they need a dose of the Holy Ghost they need to have that spiritual inoculation like Peter had he said I got the prescription all you have to do is take it right brother said I put it in pour it down their mouth and hold my hand on their mouth and they spit it out come through my hands cuz they wern't willing they didn't have the right ground for it to be planted in but we have the right ground we have the right ground what makes the the light of the Moon Fade Out the light of the sun right right the world shuts out the light it's like brother Brown said want to give you just a little Str for just a minute it's like brother Brown said he said the man said that he he' go in the house and he said there is no light so he went down in the basement went down in the basement he said after a while that man tting in the darkness so much that he become blind and you know what I was looking at that and a friend of mine he was talking about we was talking about you know when you go into this Cav and these cameras they got fish in there and they're blind but those fish wasn't blind before they got in there but you know what the first generation they lived in the darkness so long they adapted to it just like the mother of harlots she rejected the word of God and now her daughters are born blind do you know the Next Generation brother Donnie they don't have eyes didn't Isaiah speak up he said you have eyes and you see not ears and you hear not a heart to receive and you receive not this message either come to open eyes or to blind eyes that's right the Holy Ghost always does that amen ain't you glad you got eyes that are able to be open you wasn't born blind amen see they can't have their eyes on because they don't have eyes they don't have spiritual eyes because they've accepted the Creeds of man and even their children are born blind well my mama was a Methodist my daddy was a Baptist my grandma was a presbyterian I'm not knocking on denominations it's not the it's not the people it's the system that STS that's right that's right it's that sist that's so nasty where they clogged it up and get it in one little area and still letting that artisian will of the Holy Ghost work let the Holy Ghost I like what the man told Brother Bram one time he said you know what a he said you know what a what what a Pentecostal is don't you brother he said what he said that that's a Reformed Baptist oh my that's fill with the Holy Ghost and I said boy I like that I like that see it takes the Holy Ghost to transform me and you into new creatures in Christ Jesus and we see Satan is coming and he is sitting this is the only time he's ever been bold enough to set in the temple of God and be worship than God oh my oh he's sitting there sitting there claiming worship you know why because he was the chief musician he knows how he knows how and we call this stuff we call the contemporary music we see it creeping in that's right all it is is rock and roll hey I know all about that stuff cuz that's the Lord deliver me in that stuff I remember I went to this uh gospel uh book you know was a music store and I was walking around in there and they playing this and I thought my goodness boy that's horrible that's horrible she said boy the woman I said Ain that so spiritual I said spiritual spiritual I said you probably I thought myself you probably shouldn't have told me that she said don't take this oh don't just do something for you I said no it makes me want to go back to the bar I said it don't do it don't make me want to get on my knees and cry out for a better walk with God that's why the scripture told me you to try the spirit know whether it's of God or not there's good some good songs yes but you know what it's it kind of seems funny that we'd wait through the garbage can to get a piece of bread when we got all the bread that don't have to be fortified within the world or the Sten of the world that's right I like the oldfashioned sing yes down at the cross where my savior there where he paid the debt for my your sins that's the kind of stuff stuff is heartfelt we we was I studying on that one time brother Aaron I got to study on this and one I want I usually don't name names but I going to name a guy Michael W Smith and he writes a lot of songs but they asked him they said Michael W Smith said why why do you not put the blood and and stuff like that and mention Jesus in your songs that much he said well said I don't want mine to be an old bloody song and an old song like that said I don't want mine to conform to the people you know I said oh oh but the Bible told me you be not conformed right to this world but be you transformed by the renewing of your mind see they don't even think like God see we've let it come in and slip in our churches and make all these things and we don't even realize it the Beats it's a very dangerous thing you don't you look at the beat in the music BR Brown said he had that rock and roll he said I heard that in Africa before it become rock and roll don't you don't Satan knows how to receive worship that's why we try the spirit and see what so God not oh yeah you know I told her I said I told the woman at the thing I said that sounds like an old Kansas song I used to listen to I said all you did was you change the lyrics I said but the music and everything else is the same I said it's still motivating the flesh right it ain't motivating the spirit the soul I said we need something to change our soul not to get us worked up I said when I used to go to ball games I used to get worked up boy I screaming harder but you know what that didn't make me save that didn't draw me closer to God that's you know but said don't don't live no higher than you jump he said you jump high as you want to he said but when you hit the ground walk the walk you know what they're jumping Hing and screaming and they got them worked up in the motion and see what they don't understand it comes by faith right the sick sense see Satan has tricked them to depend upon the other five senses oh did you feel that I said yeah I felt Satan breathing on us I said boy that was a cold breath oh that made My Wo it just made me I said I feel Goosebumps but it ain't Holy Ghost Goosebumps that's the cold breath of Satan breathing on us getting used to it and we get accustomed to it in the christm said well you shouldn't preach and you know what they had Joel Olstein one time they had him up here I am naming names again you know they I forget who it was it Larry King interviewed him you know they said Joel how come you got the biggest Church in America he said cuz I don't preach on sin I said Woo a preacher he don't preach on sin I much a preacher woo I said he just told on his they believe in prosperity and I do too but the Bible says seek you first the kingdom of God and all his righteousness and everything else will be added unto you see if you don't get that three-fold cord wound up right when you get it wound up right it's not easily broken I'm thankful for that tonight I thinking for this message it show us these things theet of God said something in demonology 1953 he said dear God I realize that the sunset of this great civilization is Now setting he said way past spent that was in 1953 think about that my brothers and sisters he said the middle of the days are gone the evening Shadows are falling great light is breaking forth from the kingdom of God to take its place out of this gross Darkness coming on the earth he said God I realize I'm getting older every day he said let me go on Lord give me strength help me to tell this great truth everywhere we ought to be wanting to tell this truth instead of hiding back and said I'm afraid I offend somebody Jes said if you're offended in me or my words if you're ashamed of me and I'll be ashamed of you I want to be like the man had the little had the dream said he done all these things to comeing for that great light he said I'd seen I'd sinned I'd done this and he know he went right before the throne and right there boy you ain't got nothing you can't cover nothing up there that's right he said yeah I've done all that said but they heard the sweetest name sweetest voice said father he stood for me on that day he said so I'm going to stand for him on this day that's what we want Jesus standing is our advocator is our attorney and our judge s into my rest my good and faithful service means to be faithful to the trust faithful to your convictions as Christians you say well everybody El the other Church do it but what did the prophet say well this preacher preaches it what did the prophet say then the prophet even come down when he smoke spoke that thing he said and God will allow them to do things that he won't allow you to do amen we better think about those things right and then we do it boy we get a spanking right cuz Daddy said I'm not going to let you do that thank you Jesus because you're his children you're not his nieces and nephews you know nieces and nephews get away a little bit more sometime than the kids do that's right boy when the kids do it he's like well my dad said okay I'm glad he didn't spare the rod and spoil the child he taught me how to conduct myself in churches you know a lot of churches go to they don't even know how to keep their kids Reverend they run around and act allg this and I'm like my goodness man boy my daddy burn my he up amen he said you don't ch ch them you don't talk you don't do nothing you sit down and you act right that's right and boy if you didn't you went to praying cuz Daddy was going to do the he was going to bring the believer that was his b oh if you whoop a kid now child abuse use Bible say spare the rod and spoil the child he said the rod of Correction shall Drive foolishness far away that's what God does to us right the rod he said my thy rod and thy staff they comfort me ain't that what David said he said it comforts me to know he's with me and he chastens me he a give up on me he's I'm learn it didn't even the scripture say that Jesus learned obedience to the things he suffered right if you don't suffer you won't rain with him but when you get out of that suffering you begin to whine and begin to cry murmur and complain then say Lord help me to quit crying and just say Lord I'm thankful but you know what I'm I didn't even understand my dad used to tell me he said he said son this is going to hurt me worse than it hurts you and I was like yeah oh yeah yeah yeah I believe it then but you know what when you get children of your own you realize that and I had to who my I've had you know what what my daughter you know and I whoop my daughter and you know what why feel so bad watch why I just mope around all day and the Lord spoke to me and said see that he said see now that's what I feel like when I have to whoop you and I said oh God I don't want you to whoop me Lord let me be obedient right teach me your ways don't let me get accustom don't let me cool off don't let me get lukewarm see Satan don't care he don't want you to get cold that's right he wants you to get lukewarm cuz he knows God will spewed you out right that's how crafty is you have a form of godl but when you deny the power that right that's where the reubel Maks the road in witness 1954 fix on he said and while the night is getting darker gross Darkness on the earth he said may we let our light shine and I pray father that you'll light every soul in you here tonight is that not your prayer this afternoon light my soul and you father give me a new experience a greater experience today than I had yesterday don't let me point back to when I was first when I first got save but father let me say like the prophet said today is the greatest experience I've had with God you said a renewal daily God providing healing Chicago Illinois 1954 he said why is the world in such Darkness why is gross Darkness upon the people's hearts why does the spirit call out constantly and the Gentiles are shedding their hearts from the the message why are you because you are fed well you're clothed well you're not those you know ye not these mercies come from God do you know the hour is coming when you'll be weeping and crying and mourning of these things when you'll not get them he said awake while time is at hand while you can receive God receive him amen it's a shaking time brother here it's a time for us to shake ourselves say father Shake all this world in this off of me it's not a time for us to see how close we can get to the world like brother Brown give the illustration of the of the the the carriage driver he said one said he could ride that road so close to the edge of that mountain not go off of it he said devil said I can ride so close to that mountain without hitting it said the other man said I stay in the middle of the road man said that's who I want to ride with I want to ride with the one that stays in the middle of the road I want to ride with the one that's riding in the Holy Road in the straight and narrow way I don't want to see how close I get didn't the woman when brother Brown said his mother had that dream of he and this woman come up to him and they going up that Highway the woman walked up with high heels on Paul said you can't do it you can't go that way sister she said oh yes I can I'll show you Bo ain't that a lot of attitudes around the message I'll show you preacher oh yeah I'll prove it to you I can go anywh I want to and still make it right what happened though he said wasn't long he said I seen her fall off into the fire that's right said she didn't make it very far what is that that's in Blas his name we see that people think oh oh I can just fit in I don't want to fit in I I'm an oddball we're oddballs we're not supposed to come here to fit in with the world Jesus didn't come here to fit in that's right amen he come here to outfit them with the right garment he come to bring the right material for us to make it to Heaven he come to bring us the right garment the right word the right attitude the right Spirit he said you'll be hated because I'm hated what I tell you what when you stand for this message your family turns against you they call you fanatic amen cuckoo they call you cult everything that's all right God's G me this family amen he's G me this family and thank god brother AR he's G me some of the best amen the cream of the crop brothers and sisters he said I'll give you mothers I'll give you Brothers I'll give you sisters right I'll give you I give you being a being a child adopted I I appreciate that I've had two adoptions amen amen I've been adopted from my natural mother from my spiritual father amen that's why we can cry AB a father Abraham 1956 Brooklyn New York he said are you believing he said are Will You Still set in Gross darkness and believe seeing that the Messiah lives with you tonight try trying to help you trying to bless you he said how sad it is how dense unbelief is he said Oh my he said that de unbelief that he you see anything and still not believe he said that's the worst one is to doubt God's word you know he the word Danse means to be thickheaded we got a lot of thickheaded people around the message yes it says marked by stupid improvisions to ideas or Impressions imperess means not capable of being affected or disturbed don't affect them no more like brother BR said he said it's like pouring water on the duck's bag just rolls right off preacher that didn't bother me it bothers me it bothers me when God says boy you better line up I'm saying God help me help me well that was for brother so so you know what we got a lot of pitch for religion around the message I know Sister s so she needed that brother he needed that what about you what about you like Jesus said drop the Rocks drop the Rocks you without sin pitch the first load amen I'd like to say it that way look at Amos he seen gross Darkness it grieved him he said I was born a prophet or born in a prophet his house little Shepherd that anointing came on him brother Donny he went down there and told him said the same God you claim the serve will destroy you one day that's right they thought oh that mean old crank told them the truth thank God for the mean old cranks I'm glad somebody told me about Jesus right amen it ain't been a message of dos and don'ts it's been a love affair I think you're still a prisoner he said whoever serves sins still a servant of sin right ever serves Jesus as a prisoner of love I'm glad to be as brother Brown said a love slave to Jesus Christ I'm glad to be his slave see when you become his slave like Paul and Silas when they begin to sat down in that darkness when they sat in there in that old nasty dungeon locked up in Chains old Paul begin to pray it didn't face his relationship with God he began to thank God and they said five Silas began to sing boy they had a Revival so much that God shook the Earth caused the earthquake and it shook all the shackles off of them anytime you're in a time of distress or heart like the three Hebrew children when you come to that place when you come to that place see what it was when they throw into that fire brother Donnie they didn't smell like smoke neither did they have smoke no sins or no burn but you know what it did it released them from the things they was bound with so don't be scared of the fire that's your release I'm thankful for that tonight he has showed me that that you can get in the fire and the things that bind you it can't stand in the heat so Satan said I tell Satan come on with me follow me into that into that Pillar of Fire he can't do it that's right he's like woo my goodness scatter here comes the light but a lot of people are scared of the light right right Jesus said because you love Darkness more than you love light said you'll die in your sin you said you all right till the light come but there won't be no excuse over there that's right the light is coming light comes to bring wisdom to bring Revelation to brings understanding I couldn't read what was on these papers if the lights wasn't on I might try to but I couldn't read it that's right I mean but what about us that when God sent this message and shineing on this Bible man this Bible became such a new book I open this book up and I said my Lord I've never seen that I've read it over and over again he said but it's time to Quicken it to you son and it comes alive and I just have me a little old Revival you get revived by the word I like what what brother BR said about Daniel he said Daniel encouraged himself in the word instead of being discouraged he encouraged himself in the word you want encouragement the word will bring it to you I know when I've been going through something or having to going through a trial something I can open this Bible up and get to read B I find something and I said my there it is there's my answer or I can turn on one of them tapes and he'll hit just what I'm un like this just like I'm sitting there you know what I love about this message this message can transform you right into the presence of God you can sit right in there and he can do that he do that spiritual scan on you and say there's a problem Son Well Lord cut that thing out get that thing out of there right put that spiritual radiation on it kill that sin of cancer that sin of unbelief so give me an extra dose that's right I like sitting and hearing the preaching of the word for for hey Faith don't come by preaching that's right Faith come by hearing right amen oh we see that Darkness had come upon the Earth everywhere and it's on this Earth everywhere people say oh man I'm telling you man it's going to get better that's all I hear the world people say it's going to get better I said oh no better days are up oh here comes old gloom and doom I said no I'm just telling you unless you just get you get in Christ better days are for here for the believer that's right for the Christian but better days for the sinner is over with didn't David say I almost stumbled to see the wicked cross from all this he said had I not went to the house of God this is where we at this afternoon he said and then I I seen their end and he said boy my foot was Secure on this rock then he said I can stabilize cuz Upon This Rock Jesus said I'll build my church and the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail I like what David said in Psalms 18:2 said for thou Wilt light my candle the Lord my God will Enlighten my darkness Ain you glad he send this message to Enlighten the darkness to us that we can see the darkness but yet we got light to see what's going on and realize it and to have understanding Proverbs 4:19 says The Way of the Wicked is as Darkness they know not at what they stumble amen but we see The Stumbling Stones The Stumbling Stones is unbelief that's right the disbelief brother I said that attributes are smoking drinking doing all those things he said but unbelief is sin right Paul said in Ephesians 5:11 he says and we have have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness but rather reprove them and we see ministers in the pool pit are afraid to preach on sin now a lot of not you know I'm not saying around here but I'm saying you know a lot of people's kind of back because they're afraid they lose their crowd said it's a meal ticket for themra they won't pay ties said I'd rather drink Branch water and eat soda crackers that's right he said I'd rather have two real Believers than a church full of unbelievers that's right amen he said I'd rather have perfect love working through the church than all the gifts right think about that my brother and sister perfect love for what perfect love is there ain't no devil can stand Jesus said in Luke 1 verse 17 it said he came to give light to them that set in darkness and to sh and in the shadow of death to guide our feet into the way of Peace Welly you're talking about peace brother Donnie people are trying to shake it in a peel in anything to find peace oh they're taking all kind of stimets taking Xanaxes and proacs and everything to find peace I said all you got to do is go to the counselor well where's he at I said it's Jesus I said he'll prescribe you he'll diagnose your problem and he'll he'll erase it I said he won't give you a peill he'll give you the Cure he won't give you a Band-Aid he'll give you a solution we've got too many bandaid preachers we don't need Band-Aids we need a cure we need some triple antibiotic we need some penicillin we need the real inoculation of the Holy Ghost Satan tries to make us get used to the dark tries to make us get adjusted to it where we say oh well you know there there you know don't saying that to him you know sometimes God don't let you say something I've tried to witness to people right and he'd tie my tongue right and I'd get the I all right I know and then sometimes he'd say say something in that I'm not a good talker anyway but he that thing had just come out like them scriptures that this flop I said that was him that's right then they call you a m show his Pig I said you asked me you asked me do I believe in women preachers I said I wish you wouldn't ask me that do I believe in women I said how can she be the husband of one wife that ought answer your question oh you're a mou sh this P you don't believe women's rights I said yeah they got rights they got right they got biblical rights she can't be in the pull pit I said Paul said arship not a woman to have authority teach do any of those things read it to them and they're like that ain't what my preacher says I said if your picture told you to jump off that Cliff you going to jump off he said no I said well that's what you doing doing them that's right you all a spiritual Cliff cuz you're taking his word over the Divine word of God right and this word won't ever fail willever Fade Away end right here talking about getting used to here's brother BR talking about in the in the message Paradox Bakersville California he said now I remember the morning I took a flash light I'm going to apply this in the spiritual I couldn't wait to see superstitious Mountain you know what this message has become superstitious mountain to a lot of people brother Donnie you know he said I couldn't wait he said I had to get up there they want to see he said but my little flashlight was nothing he said I couldn't see nothing see by their own Works they try to understand but we can't like we said this morning it has to be by Grace he said those great spooky shadows and the men that's been killed on that mountain in search of gold boy this mountain here this message the mountain it has been nothing but a gold mine boy I can strike this thing and boy I can bring some nuggets out of there and I said Woo my Lord what what a nugget pure gold too he said spook and shadows men is killed on this mountain in search of gold and it holds many superstitions remember when Moses was on the mountain they were scared they were scared they was oh my don't let me don't let Moses don't let God speak you speak go will die say Superstition truly he says and I've tried with my little flashlight to look around he said I couldn't see nothing and everything was scary see by the own light they're trying to say this message he says you know what I did well we can take heed to this brothers and sisters he said I just set still until the sun came up that's right glory to God he said when that sun which is the king of all light when it raised up my little flashlight didn't play anything but all the Spooks left he said I seen superstitious mountain wasn't spooky I was ready to walk into it to discover it for myself that's what we got to do with this message wait till the light shines wait till the king of glory shines the Revelation on us he said because that great light of the Sun which is the spoken word of God God said let there be light he said that's the word of God manifest and when it showed all the Spooks left I don't said this message spooky anymore a lot of people walking around the message like the little boy in the graveyard scared I don't have no fear you know why cuz I believe I'm bone of his bone as we stand I believe I'm flesh of his flesh life of his life Spirit of his spirit I'm so thankful for that too I'm glad this light shined on this message Brother Don you know when people first told you about it you start about you kind of spooky to you know man they really talk about that man a lot you know what we talk about they talk about Paul a lot they talk about John a lot but you know what Paul said follow me is I follow Christ you know what I like what the prophet said when he went beyond the curtain of time he seen the real life he seen what it was really going to be like he said my don't miss it for nothing you know what he asked him he said will Paul be judged for what he preaches he said yeah he said then I I preach what Paul preed he said it was meia screaming we're resting on it so we're resting in this message there's no other rest no other
