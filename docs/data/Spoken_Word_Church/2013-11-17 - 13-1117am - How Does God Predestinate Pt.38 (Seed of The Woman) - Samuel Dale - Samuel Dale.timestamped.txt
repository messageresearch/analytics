[4:42] you want us to be we ask it all now in
[4:46] Jesus name
[4:49] amen back on our scripture in Romans 8
[4:51] then we'll go to Genesis
[4:54] 2 Romans
[4:56] 8
[4:58] 28-31 for we know that all things work
[5:01] together for good to them that love God
[5:03] to them who are thee called according to
[5:05] his purpose for whom he did for know he
[5:08] also did predestinate to be conformed to
[5:11] the image of his son that he might be
[5:13] the firstborn among many Brethren
[5:16] moreover whom he did predestinate them
[5:18] he also called and whom he called them
[5:20] he also Justified and whom he justified
[5:23] them he also glorified what shall we
[5:26] then say to these things if God be for
[5:29] us who can be against us let's go over
[5:32] to Genesis now and
[5:35] take remember Sister Freda they said
[5:38] sick this morning too so remember
[5:41] her Genesis 2 we'll just read verse 4
[5:45] through n says these are the generations
[5:48] of the heavens and the Earth where when
[5:51] they were created in the day that the
[5:52] Lord God made the earth and the heavens
[5:56] and every plet of the field before it
[5:58] was in the Earth and every herb of the
[6:00] field before it grew for the Lord God
[6:02] had not caused it to rain upon the Earth
[6:05] and there was a not a man to till the
[6:07] ground but there went up a mist from the
[6:09] earth and watered the whole face of the
[6:11] ground and the Lord God formed man out
[6:15] Mo man of the Dust of the ground and
[6:18] breathed into his nostrils a breath of
[6:19] life and he became a living
[6:21] soul and the Lord God planted a garden
[6:24] Eastward in Eden and there he put the
[6:26] man whom he had formed and out of the
[6:28] ground made the Lord God to grow every
[6:30] tree that is Pleasant to the sight and
[6:33] good for food the tree of life also in
[6:36] the midst of the garden and the tree of
[6:38] knowledge of Good and Evil you may be
[6:40] seated the Lord at his Blessing to the
[6:43] reading of the
[6:45] word now we have been
[6:50] on during Genesis and trying to cover a
[6:53] lot of things and oh yeah let me read a
[6:55] let me read a
[6:57] testimony that we received about
[7:00] we were concerned about him and been
[7:02] praying about him I know everybody has
[7:03] about brother Collins and this is the
[7:06] testimony that came in uh today from I
[7:11] guess it's the oldest girl and it really
[7:14] blowed me when I see I said who is that
[7:16] you know because I didn't recognize the
[7:18] name but it's the oldest girl Anna and
[7:21] she says this is thankful day number 16
[7:25] I am thankful that God still works
[7:28] miracles amen amen and I'm thankful for
[7:31] his healing blood mom called last night
[7:34] to say that Dad had all his color back
[7:37] in his face and hands he went months
[7:39] looking pale and God sent him to the
[7:41] right doctors to get him the help he
[7:44] needed and God placed his blood back
[7:46] into his body to flow normally and the
[7:50] anism the doctor said he would always
[7:53] have on his main artery this doctor
[7:56] couldn't even find it yeah amen and the
[8:00] x-rays amen that ain't
[8:03] all that ain't all just hold
[8:05] on and the first EKG showed his heart
[8:10] was dead on the bottom and
[8:12] top listen because we knew that we had
[8:16] you know we had talked with him and
[8:17] encouraged him to go to the doctor and
[8:19] he has been feeling real bad and all
[8:22] we've been down hunting a little bit Dar
[8:23] and he hadn't been out fellowshipping
[8:25] like he's been at it cuz I'm sure he
[8:26] didn't feel right but thank God he went
[8:29] to the doctor amen and they begin to
[8:31] help him but watch what it says now the
[8:34] first a EKG showed his heart was dead on
[8:36] the bottom and top 10 tests
[8:40] later the doctor came
[8:44] inad
[8:47] amen scratching his
[8:49] head he said I can't find it
[8:56] amen now I don't know what happened this
[8:58] is what the doctor Y and him and the
[9:02] nurse just thank God right there in the
[9:04] room for God's healings touch so thank
[9:08] you
[9:09] God that's something a
[9:13] it to tell you in an EKG and things that
[9:16] your heart is dead and then come back
[9:17] and tell you that you can't find
[9:19] anything wrong with it that's something
[9:22] is it that's that's God's healing
[9:25] virture amen cuz I knew brother Collins
[9:27] was was had been sick and we've been
[9:30] really concerned about praying about him
[9:32] and brother Ray and I yesterday we were
[9:34] trying on the telephone to make contact
[9:35] to see if they had heard anymore and all
[9:39] from him and uh so just keep praying for
[9:41] him I'm sure he still needs prayer but
[9:43] thank God for for touching him and for
[9:46] the doctors having to testify all right
[9:50] now to me brother Brown said if God
[9:53] comes down and heals one person he said
[9:55] that ought to throw everybody into
[9:57] desperation to believe right amen cuz we
[10:00] can heal one he can heal
[10:03] everybody right so then we ought to
[10:05] believe it amen all right now we've been
[10:08] talking for quite a while about the
[10:11] Garden of Eden and the things that was
[10:13] taking place in the
[10:15] garden and using that to
[10:17] show how that God
[10:21] predestines how do we how do we see that
[10:24] he predestines by his for
[10:28] knowledge he doesn't predestinate
[10:31] anybody to be lost but he doesn't
[10:35] predestinate anybody to be saved right
[10:37] amen because he leaves us as a free
[10:39] moral agent to where we can
[10:42] choose uh you know which way we go right
[10:46] all right now in doing that then see he
[10:49] can't make us
[10:51] fall and be just to judge us right but
[10:55] before the foundation of the world he
[10:57] knew we would fall
[10:59] y see all right but he knew also what he
[11:03] would
[11:04] do that's the point we spent a lot about
[11:07] to fall but yet how much time do we
[11:10] spend about thinking about what he his
[11:13] plan and purpose was right what was his
[11:16] plan and purpose to reveal
[11:19] himself make himself known to the man
[11:23] that he would create amen right all
[11:26] right see then in doing that then he
[11:28] would could be come then by permitting
[11:31] us to fall not making us but permitting
[11:34] us to fall then he could come on the
[11:38] scene and display his attributes of
[11:41] Savior
[11:43] healer
[11:44] father comforter whatever Advocate
[11:48] whatever the things you know and see if
[11:50] it hadn't been for the
[11:52] fall he could not display those things
[11:56] but we've went over it and over it and
[11:58] over it to make sure we don't
[12:00] misunderstand it and somebody listening
[12:01] to us
[12:03] misunderstand that see he couldn't make
[12:05] us lost right sir he couldn't
[12:09] predetermine us to be
[12:11] lost you know without giving us a choice
[12:15] right all right then he would give us a
[12:17] choice you know and I know a lot of
[12:20] people don't believe it that way but
[12:21] that's fine this is what I believe you
[12:24] know in the word of God all right and
[12:27] see then that way he would be able to
[12:29] fulfill his plan cuz he's his forn
[12:34] knowledge knew that he could be able to
[12:38] bring to
[12:40] pass his word right you know and his
[12:46] dos and all like that and it's a
[12:49] wonderful picture but if you try to make
[12:51] it a stamp to fire you know well this is
[12:54] predestination that's Destiny determined
[12:56] but the prophet of God said what for
[12:58] knowledge comes first am we've been
[13:01] through that about 36 sermons ago so if
[13:04] you want to listen to them go back if
[13:05] you don't then argue all you want to I
[13:09] don't have time to argue I'm trying to
[13:10] preach to get us out of here all right
[13:13] now see man when man
[13:19] fail the fall never pulled anything over
[13:21] on God that's the point I'm trying to
[13:24] get you to
[13:25] see he knew what we would do right
[13:28] that's right he knew we would fall if we
[13:30] were given free moral agency he knew
[13:33] Satan would fall he was given free moral
[13:36] agency and he fail he knew we would fall
[13:39] all right then in doing it see then he
[13:42] could display himself to you and
[13:45] I as being a savior healer and things
[13:48] we're talking about all
[13:51] right but now what I want you to look
[13:55] at especially today this morning part
[14:00] we've went through what happened in the
[14:02] garden the fall and we we believe what
[14:06] happened and and tried to show in the
[14:08] scriptures and the things you know and
[14:11] we shown that really the the what is sin
[14:16] unbelief all right see that's the
[14:19] original sin but we know also that sin
[14:22] being
[14:23] unbelief that sin would have an
[14:26] attribute or a display
[14:29] of sin so it would go into literal
[14:34] happenings and we believe that's what
[14:36] happened in the garden see that Eve
[14:38] disbelieved God and then she accepted by
[14:41] doing that Satan's
[14:43] lie and we you know we spent the time
[14:47] trying to show what's went on and trying
[14:50] to be to the place that we could
[14:54] understand but now I want you to notice
[14:57] something cuz cuz this is the way I
[14:59] think you know all
[15:02] right God knew we would fall all
[15:07] right and he knew what he was going to
[15:11] do
[15:13] okay so he already had in the
[15:17] garden the tree of life amen right we
[15:20] read it there amen
[15:24] okay he already had that tree there when
[15:28] man was brought into
[15:30] being the tree was in the garden amen
[15:35] all
[15:36] right showing what he was going to
[15:40] doely amen right that's good and showing
[15:45] that by his for
[15:49] knowledge he knew what we'
[15:51] do but by his for knowledge he knew what
[15:54] he'd
[15:55] do so he wouldn't leave man lost
[15:59] that's what I'm trying to drive the
[16:00] point now about I know I've done it on
[16:03] the last few
[16:04] services but it's not a problem for me
[16:07] to preach things over and over and over
[16:09] it's Paul said it's
[16:13] needful but now watch as I said he had
[16:16] the tree was
[16:19] D now if there was not an
[16:22] ability to receive from that tree why
[16:26] would a tree be there
[16:30] right we we went through and covered the
[16:31] tree of knowledge of Good and Evil was
[16:35] what Satan in his bases of unbelief
[16:39] coming to Eve all right not an apple
[16:42] tree or something like that it it's a
[16:44] funnyl looking tree because it's a tree
[16:46] of knowledge of Good and Evil it's a
[16:48] tree to make one wise it didn't say a
[16:50] tree to make one where they wouldn't be
[16:51] hungry because they ate some fruit or
[16:54] give you the belly ache it was a tree to
[16:56] make you
[16:57] wise had to be something about
[17:01] intelligence all right and in doing that
[17:06] his for knowledge that he knew what we
[17:08] would do the same for knowledge he knew
[17:10] what he would do amen all right that he
[17:14] would make a
[17:17] way all right remember now how that we
[17:19] covered that paragraph 187 these are not
[17:22] on the thing now
[17:24] so in Blasphemous 9 WR around paragraph
[17:27] 187 through 190
[17:29] he covers that into Adam's nostrils was
[17:32] breathed the breath of eternal life and
[17:36] he even uses there that he became an
[17:38] eternal person with
[17:40] God all right now how could he then
[17:47] destroy do you understand what I'm
[17:49] getting
[17:50] at I'm trying to get the picture to
[17:52] unfold to you and
[17:54] I that not a picture of this problem's
[17:57] coming and have has L and yeah God
[18:00] finally figured out something about this
[18:02] you know it was going wrong he decided
[18:04] he better do
[18:05] something
[18:07] no how could he give Adam eternal
[18:12] life and then him be lost right right
[18:17] amen so he started off the creation of
[18:20] mankind in a beautiful picture
[18:25] amen all right then we went through on
[18:29] the breach of the seal books paragraph
[18:33] 91 where did Adam fail from eternal life
[18:37] to death in the
[18:38] garden now he never
[18:42] fail to from eternal life
[18:46] to Eternal separation I don't believe
[18:51] that because that would be God being an
[18:53] ending giver and he wouldn't be doing it
[18:55] I believe that he gave him eternal life
[18:58] amen but yet Adam's Body was not
[19:01] Eternal and his body not being Eternal
[19:05] then when
[19:07] he
[19:09] fell he fell
[19:11] to human natural
[19:14] death it would take 800 years later
[19:17] before it ever come or ever how old Adam
[19:19] was but he would still die because
[19:22] methusa was 969 and that's the oldest
[19:25] man see nobody lived a thousand years
[19:26] all
[19:27] right so
[19:29] then he never reached the
[19:33] position it's like brother brandom on on
[19:36] who is this
[19:38] mzd he said Jesus
[19:41] came theophany word
[19:44] body to begin with right but he said we
[19:47] by pass that now was that a by pass that
[19:51] it was there we went around it and come
[19:56] back did we by to the when he says it
[19:59] are theop is your soul even a sinner's
[20:02] soul is his
[20:04] theophany so did we byp pass or is it
[20:07] the fact that we never came that
[20:11] way well you're just trying to I'm what
[20:14] I'm trying my best to preach the
[20:17] truth you quote yourself to death well
[20:20] brother brandham said Adam fell from
[20:23] eternal life to
[20:25] death amen he died
[20:29] y right but did you go to
[20:33] hell if you did you got a problem with
[20:35] the
[20:36] resurrection where your own Prophet will
[20:38] say that one day Adam will reach over
[20:41] and Shake Eve and Eve reach over and
[20:44] Abel and say there'll be a resurrection
[20:47] he he never put Adam in hell all right
[20:52] so I'm trying my best to get us to get a
[20:54] clear
[20:55] understanding of a lot of things instead
[20:58] of of just quote right you know all
[21:03] right now watch this part as we think
[21:07] about
[21:09] it that when man
[21:12] fa now as I said he'd already give him
[21:16] eternal life in Adam and Eve their soul
[21:18] so there had to be something worked out
[21:21] so he would have to send a redeemer amen
[21:24] right irregardless of what you want to
[21:26] think about what happened to Adam come
[21:28] on I mean if you think he died and went
[21:30] to hell whatever you think about it
[21:32] still remember one thing but the fact of
[21:35] him being where he was the position it
[21:38] would mean that God would have to redeem
[21:41] him amen you agree amen all right now so
[21:45] if he would redeem
[21:47] him what's so beautiful is the way I
[21:49] think I mean you know I'm that's that's
[21:51] carnal a how beautiful I
[21:56] think I think it is some times but
[21:59] that's all
[22:02] right but now God didn't leave
[22:05] everything
[22:07] just laying there you
[22:10] know but the first thing he
[22:13] done all right was
[22:18] what go to number
[22:20] two Genesis 3:21 it says
[22:24] what what did God
[22:26] do what's the first thing he did
[22:33] done and Adam also into his wife did the
[22:36] Lord God make coats of skin to clothe
[22:38] them all
[22:41] right
[22:45] now he went through as the prophet said
[22:47] on the way to have Fellowship that God
[22:51] introduced to the world a blood
[22:53] Redemption and God killed those
[22:56] animals and took the skins and give them
[22:58] to Adam and
[23:01] Eve
[23:03] starting a Redemptive
[23:06] planen now are you listening amen
[23:09] starting a Redemptive
[23:11] plan cuz you see the
[23:18] animals the animal caused the fall or
[23:21] was used in the fall so we went through
[23:23] that in the church the Ephesian Church
[23:25] age uh page 102 Church age
[23:29] book animal was using the fall so animal
[23:32] would become the sacrifice am that's
[23:35] sensible all right but now think about
[23:39] it the animal sacrifice was only the
[23:44] beginning of the Plan of Redemption amen
[23:47] that's right because the animal life had
[23:51] no soul to be able to come back upon the
[23:54] believer right so it was only the start
[23:58] of of it right you see it would only
[24:01] speak of what would come
[24:05] later see the animal life would make the
[24:08] atonement for
[24:11] sin right
[24:14] right but the animal life could not take
[24:17] away that
[24:19] sin and no matter if he did make a a
[24:22] coach of
[24:24] skin all that done was
[24:27] atoned
[24:29] it didn't eradicate sin right are you
[24:32] listening
[24:35] now but when you come to Genesis 3:15 go
[24:39] ahead and pull it up where you can read
[24:42] it said I'll put
[24:46] enmity between thy seed and her
[24:50] seed and what would take
[24:53] place see had he left it with just the
[24:57] atonement
[24:59] that would have just been
[25:03] covering no eradication of sin through
[25:06] the animal
[25:07] atonement so he had to do something
[25:10] else so he
[25:13] promised the seed of the woman
[25:19] right says thy seed and her
[25:22] seed he promised
[25:25] that all
[25:27] right now now be real
[25:32] careful how you're listening for the
[25:34] next few minutes cuz I know I have a
[25:36] funny way of presenting
[25:41] things but now remember it's called the
[25:45] the seed of the woman I'll put enmity
[25:48] between thy seed and her
[25:51] seed now why would it say that way why
[25:53] would it say her
[25:55] seed and why would it say thy seed
[26:00] and first off Satan does not have a
[26:03] seed he's a spirit being right I'll read
[26:07] this to you in a
[26:08] second he has no literal
[26:15] seed that's why it's called the seed of
[26:17] the
[26:18] serpent but he has no literal
[26:22] seed all right it's called The Seed of
[26:25] the woman or her seed
[26:29] when a woman don't have a seed
[26:32] right A woman has an egg
[26:36] right the male has the
[26:41] sperm but see that way Eve couldn't re
[26:44] bring
[26:46] forth but Adam couldn't bring forth
[26:53] right we lay heavily on the man having
[26:57] to The Germ of life and that's true
[27:02] see if the hen hadn't been with a
[27:04] rooster the eggs are no good I mean they
[27:07] the eggs you can eat them but they won't
[27:10] reproduce all
[27:13] right but a woman doesn't have a seed
[27:15] why would it say her
[27:20] seed
[27:24] okay but yet we read of it in the Bible
[27:27] and we read and we talk about the seed
[27:30] of the
[27:32] serpent all right now if you're
[27:34] referring to the
[27:37] serpent as being
[27:41] Satan and that's what the Book of
[27:43] Revelations we read the scriptures we
[27:44] gave it you know the serpent the Old
[27:47] Devil right it refers to him as a
[27:51] serpent all right but yet Satan does not
[27:55] have a seed amen his seed is unbelief
[28:01] right he couldn't create as God could
[28:05] create Adam and Eve
[28:08] right but he couldn't
[28:12] create all right but it speaks of his
[28:16] seed now what is the seed of The
[28:20] Serpent and what is the seed of the
[28:26] woman wanting you to think think
[28:28] seriously with me about
[28:30] it and you'll hear Brother random in the
[28:32] Bible to talk about the
[28:37] seed but just remember in The Parables
[28:40] there was only two
[28:44] seeds it's the seed of God which is his
[28:47] word is that Jesus say in the parable
[28:49] the St went forth to so and then here
[28:51] comes a man
[28:52] sewing another
[28:56] seed Satan doesn't have a seed that's
[29:00] right no physical part about him amen
[29:05] it's a Propet to say Satan seed or
[29:07] serpent seed or whatever but
[29:12] remember as I said you can quote
[29:14] yourself to
[29:16] death that's right but when you do I'm
[29:19] going to be standing waiting on you to
[29:20] come back brother Mo had a good
[29:22] illustration he said if you got a rabbit
[29:24] and he gets in your pen you know or in
[29:25] where your garden is he said they don't
[29:27] need getting in there and chasing that
[29:28] rabbit you're going to tire up a lot of
[29:30] stuff he said just find out where he got
[29:33] in at and go put your foot Over the
[29:36] Hole said he's coming back to
[29:39] there Old Timer some of them are old
[29:42] enough here and old brother how's
[29:43] listening in he's old enough you go
[29:45] rabbit hunting they said my daddy was
[29:47] the best at it cuz when the dogs jumped
[29:49] the rabbit he didn't go chasing the
[29:53] dogs he just
[29:56] waited you know what rabbit going to
[29:58] come back where it left
[30:00] from dogs going to run him all over the
[30:02] country but he coming back to the come
[30:04] that's his home so he just wait on him
[30:07] all right now what's my
[30:10] point my point is I'm not going to argue
[30:13] with you about quoting
[30:16] right oh I've got these quotes here
[30:18] brother randam said 40,000 times the
[30:21] seed of the serpent well
[30:25] amen the Bible speaks of a seed amen
[30:28] amen the Bible speaks of a serpent
[30:33] amen but
[30:36] remember the devil don't have a
[30:39] seed a literal part he can't create he
[30:44] can't even use what he's got as far as
[30:46] to bring
[30:48] anything God kept that from him right
[30:51] all right now in doing that what does it
[30:55] take to make a
[30:56] seed
[31:00] and brother random will say 4 42,000
[31:03] times that the man has the seed I don't
[31:06] mean that I didn't look it up to see I'm
[31:08] just showing you
[31:11] that he says a man has the
[31:16] seed well now a man has the
[31:21] sperm he doesn't have a
[31:24] seed if he had a seed he could reproduce
[31:26] himself without the woman
[31:31] right come
[31:33] on if the woman had a seed she could
[31:36] reproduce
[31:37] herself
[31:40] right so what does it mean to seed of
[31:42] the woman it's got to be telling
[31:45] something in a way that is hidden from
[31:48] the eyes of
[31:50] mankind but yet to be revealed to us as
[31:53] the word of
[31:56] God
[31:59] what is the seed of the serpent what is
[32:01] the seed of of the
[32:04] woman there are such things as worms
[32:07] that or what do you call that word by
[32:09] what asex asexual asexual okay I didn't
[32:13] pronounce that correctly y'all blame him
[32:15] I don't
[32:16] know which means that worm can be either
[32:19] male or
[32:20] female he don't need another
[32:24] worm he can do by himself right but but
[32:28] now the human beings are not that
[32:32] way so the woman has the
[32:34] egg or
[32:37] field the man has the sperm or germ
[32:41] using the
[32:44] terminologies but you know that it takes
[32:47] an egg right and a germ to make a seed
[32:56] y okay
[32:58] now now if that ain't right I want you
[33:01] explain to explain to me the new
[33:09] birth cuz a new birth is not just
[33:16] believing even though you receive the
[33:18] word of God that's right it's not alive
[33:22] until the holy spirit amen quickens that
[33:25] word right amen
[33:28] now you can have the new
[33:29] birth all right do you see where we're
[33:32] putting it what is the seed of the woman
[33:35] what is the seed of the
[33:40] serpent so they said listen real
[33:43] carefully cuz I'm trying to get you to
[33:45] not miss
[33:46] something go ahead to number four and
[33:48] let's read what brother randam has to
[33:55] say my wife name there an and Richard
[33:59] and Abby they didn't hear what we were
[34:01] saying want to
[34:03] go we got a note about brother Collins
[34:07] that they can't find anything wrong with
[34:09] it
[34:11] amen they said his heart was dead in the
[34:15] bottom and dead in the
[34:17] top by their own EKGs they run their
[34:19] test over and can't find
[34:21] nothing so God still the Healer right
[34:25] but look what the prophet has to say now
[34:27] on a message called Oneness I'd invite
[34:29] you to listen to this whole message 1962
[34:34] 211 paragraph e or paragraph 98 89 and
[34:38] 90 listen what happened I said all right
[34:40] I want to ask you something the woman
[34:43] has no egg listen to what he's saying
[34:46] now she has no seed she's got an egg
[34:49] he's not saying that way she has no seed
[34:54] he said now he said not an egg
[35:00] the Bible don't say the Egg of the woman
[35:03] it says the seed of the woman why now
[35:07] listen to my point about the Book of
[35:09] Genesis and the Book of Revelations
[35:11] especially the most fought at two books
[35:13] in the
[35:15] Bible to take our own
[35:19] understanding we're going to make it say
[35:21] a lot of things it doesn't say but to
[35:24] what I'm trying to get you to see is
[35:27] that it doesn't say in Genesis the egg
[35:30] cuz she does have an
[35:34] egg but she doesn't have a
[35:37] seed all right now the Bible said Jesus
[35:42] said I think the old father that thou
[35:44] has hid these things from the eyes of
[35:47] the wise and prudent but revealed them
[35:49] unto babes which is would learn right
[35:51] now if it had been written in
[35:54] Genesis that Eve and the Beast had had a
[35:57] sexual
[36:02] aair would have been a
[36:06] mystery would have been any
[36:11] secret but it doesn't say that does it
[36:13] amen right it's like they ate an
[36:17] apple but see God's hiding it right
[36:22] amen that he can reveal
[36:25] it thank God for the revelation am all
[36:28] right so it doesn't say now the woman
[36:30] has no she has she has no seed he said
[36:33] now he said not in the egg he said thy
[36:36] seed and she had no seed right see if it
[36:40] have said she don't have an egg I mean
[36:43] she you know she's got an egg right the
[36:46] woman produces the egg right all right
[36:49] listen now it takes a union to make a
[36:53] seed is that right he's as the doctor
[36:57] cuz one sitting there has to be if you
[37:00] got a whole lot of pup out here didn't
[37:03] have no life in it and planted it out
[37:05] here and and it wouldn't never come up
[37:07] lay there and rot you couldn't plant
[37:10] that life without having the pup see you
[37:13] can't pant the pup without the life and
[37:15] you can't pant the life without the pup
[37:18] you got to get it together to make a
[37:19] seed all right so you see the whole
[37:22] thing is a union now watch what he says
[37:26] I'm trying to tell you now about Christ
[37:28] in the
[37:29] church okay the new birth in other words
[37:32] it's a union and if the woman is the
[37:35] seed of
[37:37] herself then she doesn't need the
[37:40] mail she can have her baby
[37:45] herself
[37:49] right but she can't be she can't have
[37:51] the baby until she's been with a male
[37:54] because it takes the two together to
[37:55] make a seed is that right plant a seed
[37:59] with no life in it and see what
[38:02] happens he goes on to tell you about it
[38:04] and you know you know they've ever tried
[38:06] it they evidently had a woman pregnated
[38:09] some way to show that with an animal or
[38:11] dog that it didn't
[38:13] produce why because of different seeds
[38:15] different genes different doings you
[38:18] know they've tried
[38:20] it but think about
[38:23] it it takes the egg and the sperm to
[38:27] make the
[38:29] seed but yet you can
[38:31] say
[38:35] seed
[38:38] right and you can say the seed of the
[38:42] woman you you you can say talking about
[38:46] a man and talking about his
[38:51] seed all right but just remember
[38:54] now you got to have the union to make a
[39:01] seed cuz if it was just a seed without a
[39:04] union part then you wouldn't need the
[39:06] new
[39:09] birth but see it takes the word and the
[39:12] spirit to bring the New Birth Faith
[39:15] Comes what by hearing to hearing by the
[39:18] word of God faith
[39:21] Revelation that's why nobody in the
[39:23] Bible was ever born again and nobody's
[39:25] ever been born again with without first
[39:27] hearing the word right amen show it to
[39:30] me right well I was just sitting out
[39:32] under the
[39:35] tree well Mama had told you about it
[39:38] Daddy had told you about somebody told
[39:40] you about Jesus
[39:43] Christ Ain pre no preacher have anything
[39:45] to do with my new
[39:46] birth well that may be true maybe you
[39:48] don't have it right that's a good point
[39:52] but just think about it
[39:54] now why would God call it
[39:59] thy seed speaking to the
[40:02] serpent that was standing there in the
[40:07] Beast and thy
[40:09] seed which would turn out to be the seed
[40:11] of the
[40:16] woman I'm just trying to get you to
[40:18] seriously
[40:20] think see then that would hide
[40:24] it from the wise and prudent amen
[40:28] and let me wise and prudent in the
[40:29] people of the message and quote quote
[40:32] quote quote quote quote quote quote I
[40:33] got this quote I got that I'm only got
[40:35] 300 quotes on this I don't know where to
[40:37] preach it or
[40:40] not you can quote yourself to
[40:43] death and it not be lined up that's
[40:46] right now come
[40:49] on how many of you before you heard of
[40:51] this message used to believe in a
[40:52] trinity ain't no even raising hands cuz
[40:55] we all did that's right one way or the
[40:58] other
[41:02] right how many of us believe hell was
[41:06] eternal till we heard the
[41:08] truth you know what we we we we take the
[41:12] Bible to prove
[41:14] that and it all
[41:17] wrong
[41:20] right see then let's get away from just
[41:23] thinking about some and open up our
[41:25] minds to the point of thinking about
[41:30] the seed of The
[41:31] Serpent and the seed of the
[41:35] woman and just think about it right go
[41:39] ahead with number five brother baptism
[41:41] of the Holy Spirit reach 1958 928 the
[41:45] morning service paragraph
[41:49] 78 and now before we can finish that
[41:52] subject we'll have to pick it up tonight
[41:54] in the seat of The Serpent and the seed
[41:56] of the woman all right now
[41:58] and bring it down and show you why it
[42:01] is see how that the seed of the serpent
[42:04] moved down out at the seat of the woman
[42:06] move
[42:08] down that's what we're going to run
[42:10] through the Bible when we get time to go
[42:12] through and show it at that the seat of
[42:15] the serpent begin to to predominate or
[42:18] how you that's I guess that's the way
[42:21] you pronounce it he used it again
[42:23] predominate predominate get greater and
[42:25] greater greater greater greater until
[42:28] now there's nothing left but just a
[42:30] little small remnant of names still
[42:32] that's left written from the foundation
[42:34] of the
[42:36] world so the seed of the serpent has
[42:39] taken over the
[42:40] world Jesus addressed it in all of the
[42:44] kingdoms when Satan offered him all the
[42:46] kingdoms right amen he said
[42:51] no I'm going to pay the price right I've
[42:54] got to
[42:56] die
[42:58] all
[43:00] right but see as it comes down we want
[43:03] to try to make
[43:06] lineages all
[43:12] right I thought according to the parable
[43:14] of Jesus they were the children of the
[43:17] kingdom and the children of the wicked
[43:20] one that was all I knew I mean it's all
[43:23] I know in the
[43:25] Bible I don't know of three or four
[43:26] different seeds to
[43:28] you right and just as we covered this
[43:31] past
[43:34] Wednesday that everybody in the
[43:39] world is born with the mark of the
[43:45] beast because it's only the mark of the
[43:47] beast or the Seal of God and there's no
[43:49] in between
[43:51] area he said well brother D I don't how
[43:53] to mark of the
[43:55] beast do we have the same ideas or
[43:58] thoughts or trinitarian isms that people
[44:00] had cuz that's the mark of the beast
[44:01] it's in your
[44:02] forehead it's not a stamp or a tattoo
[44:06] that's put on you or something got to be
[44:07] here or got to be a little number here
[44:09] or something I ain't going to deceive
[44:11] nobody that's bad as my brother-in-law
[44:14] used to think that that Beast would rise
[44:15] up and it says it rise up out of the sea
[44:17] you know he he literally believed that
[44:19] one of these days they' be big old
[44:21] animal come walking out
[44:23] ocean well who's that going to deceive
[44:26] right
[44:28] I told him I said that ain't deceiving
[44:29] nobody it's got to be a religious
[44:32] Mark no big old animal it says a beast
[44:35] well he just well there's a whale washed
[44:38] up on the shore there maybe a few weeks
[44:40] after then or something and I told Pig I
[44:42] said well I guess Robert thinks that was
[44:43] the the dead Beast come up but I wasn't
[44:47] making light of him that was his
[44:50] belief he's very
[44:55] serious but thinkk about it
[45:00] now the seed of the
[45:04] serpent all
[45:06] right now what are you making out of
[45:12] that
[45:17] because Satan doesn't have a seed
[45:25] right all right that's simp isn't
[45:30] it he has
[45:34] unbelief that's his seed if you want to
[45:36] call it seed just means a core something
[45:40] or or an ability of
[45:43] reproduction and that's why I was
[45:44] getting at it a while ago see if you if
[45:46] you don't have the word and spirit it
[45:47] can't reproduce if you don't have the
[45:50] egg and the sperm you can't reproduce
[45:53] one by itself won't work the other one
[45:55] won't work Eve couldn't bring forth
[45:57] neither could the Beast bring forth and
[45:59] and neither could Satan bring forth cuz
[46:02] he didn't have a literal
[46:06] seed so by his doing he could enter the
[46:10] animal the
[46:11] Beast the missing link between the man
[46:14] and the
[46:14] monkey and if you got a scof your Bible
[46:17] if you ain't I'll sure let you read mine
[46:19] he even says says that that Beast was an
[46:21] upright
[46:23] creature made a snake by the curse all
[46:26] right simple
[46:29] but see it wasn't the seed of the
[46:32] serpent the seed of the serpent is Satan
[46:35] right the seed of the Beast is what
[46:38] caused the
[46:40] natural
[46:42] problem all
[46:44] right but yet he had to get through E's
[46:49] mind and she accepted that
[46:53] lie in her
[46:55] brain
[46:57] memories and conscious affections to her
[47:01] spirit and she conceived that idea in
[47:04] her mind before a woman can take a man
[47:06] she has to conceive it in her mind think
[47:09] about
[47:10] it all
[47:12] right
[47:14] now if you can see what I'm getting
[47:18] at the Beast couldn't reproduce
[47:22] himself Eve couldn't reproduce
[47:25] herself Adam couldn't reproduce
[47:30] hisself
[47:32] right and Satan not having a seed being
[47:35] a spiritual being not a natural
[47:39] being he had to use the
[47:44] Beast see because he knew brother said
[47:47] Satan has a knowledge of the principles
[47:48] of life now that another words that
[47:51] means to me in plain carnal language
[47:53] that if he's got a knowledge of the
[47:55] princip of life he knows what life life
[47:57] consist of whether whatever it be you
[47:59] know what we consist of and what we are
[48:01] and everything and he he he he's the one
[48:04] brother R said it put these people on
[48:05] the
[48:07] moon it wouldn't
[48:10] God Satan's knowledge intellect Etc s on
[48:15] the moon what do we need the moon for
[48:17] brother R said we're going to go by
[48:18] there one of these days to fice so you
[48:20] won't even see the thing am we don't
[48:23] need no
[48:25] moon
[48:29] but now listen Satan not being able to
[48:34] create as God could create in the for
[48:37] fact of all the animals everything then
[48:38] Adam and
[48:40] Eve but he had a
[48:43] knowledge that this
[48:48] Beast could mingle with the human
[48:52] race all right and as he did then
[48:58] he found a
[49:02] way other words think about it there
[49:04] were Satan back there he seen what God
[49:06] done he seen how God created how he
[49:08] brought everything into being it was
[49:10] beautiful and he said but I've got to
[49:12] figure out a
[49:15] way so he took the weaker vessel to
[49:17] woman you know and he started with
[49:21] that and he brought to P the fall as we'
[49:24] call it in the garden
[49:28] but see he used the
[49:30] Beast now and if that's not true I I
[49:33] like to put something if a brother htis
[49:37] used to say that it was good if a equals
[49:40] B now I'm surely not what that's algebra
[49:43] I'm certainly not a major but if a
[49:46] equals
[49:47] B you know what that means B is the same
[49:51] as
[49:52] a
[49:54] right if a equals B
[49:57] all right now if a means
[50:02] that the bees couldn't reproduce
[50:06] himself through
[50:08] Eve until he brought the point with Eve
[50:13] all
[50:14] right and that Satan could never in no
[50:16] way reproduce
[50:19] himself so we see seem as brother R said
[50:22] like he used the swines at
[50:25] Gia
[50:27] when he entered into them and they ran
[50:29] down the hill and killed
[50:31] themselves I like the way he said it one
[50:33] day he said see them pigs didn't want
[50:35] nothing to do with the devil and then we
[50:37] turn around and accept him something to
[50:39] that degree but think about
[50:46] it what was the seed of the
[50:49] serpent it began his
[50:55] unbelief all right right then it went
[50:57] from unbelief to an attribute like
[51:00] smoking drinking gambling Etc is an
[51:02] attribute of sin all
[51:05] all so what Satan
[51:08] done he was standing looking at the way
[51:11] God done things but he said I can't do
[51:12] it that way so he said okay I'll do it
[51:15] this
[51:18] way see he's smart he's shrewed as an
[51:23] example balum could couldn't get God to
[51:27] curse Israel right you remember told not
[51:31] to go and he went all the time you
[51:32] remember that in the Bible he couldn't
[51:33] get God to curse Israel he even himself
[51:35] in his writings is in the Bible he said
[51:37] D like a unicorn he said who can can who
[51:41] can curse what God has blessed that was
[51:42] even balum in his
[51:44] prophecies all
[51:46] right but what did balum
[51:51] do he said okay I can't curse
[51:55] him but said B I'll tell you what to do
[51:58] he said all you got to do is get them
[52:00] them women over them men and
[52:02] said and problem will take
[52:05] place and said when it do God's going to
[52:07] come
[52:08] down right we'll get to it eventually
[52:12] when we get over to the point of where
[52:13] that it says right at the flood it says
[52:16] the sons of God saw the daughters of
[52:22] man the sons of God would be the
[52:24] children coming down from Seth
[52:27] I'm quoting brother
[52:30] randam but them beautiful women were
[52:33] coming from kan's
[52:37] lineage now in doing that
[52:41] then Satan says
[52:46] okay I I've been talking through this
[52:50] beast and I done got her to
[52:54] disbelieve I done got her mind and her
[52:56] thinking her conscience and her memories
[52:58] and I done got that all messed
[53:01] up and says now I see my only ability to
[53:05] enter the human
[53:06] race in any
[53:08] form would have to be through that
[53:13] Beast he said if we can do if I can get
[53:15] that done God will have to come down
[53:18] that's where the mistake was CU he said
[53:20] God would have to come down and curse
[53:22] him do you remember we read it future
[53:25] home
[53:27] R said God didn't curse Adam read your
[53:29] Bible and see if he did he said he
[53:31] didn't even curse
[53:33] Eve but said he cursed the serpent he
[53:36] cursed the world because of the things
[53:38] amen why because as I saying when I
[53:41] started he had his plan and purpose he
[53:43] was going to achieve amen and he
[53:46] couldn't destroy them right amen but all
[53:49] right but there they are
[53:52] now his literal
[53:55] way
[53:57] of doing something so let's
[53:58] read go ahead with number six this is
[54:01] page 99 of the Ephesian Church age which
[54:03] is church age
[54:06] book this portion of the scripture of
[54:08] scripture is a revelation of how the
[54:11] literal seat of the serpent was swn in
[54:13] the
[54:14] earth watch even as as we have the
[54:18] account of Luke 1:26 through3 where he
[54:21] set forth the exact account of how the
[54:24] seed of the woman y came into physical
[54:28] manifestation apart from the
[54:32] instrumentality of the human
[54:35] male you see that's where I love the the
[54:39] the the
[54:40] Bible and the way the prophet will use
[54:43] it to describe so he doesn't deal with
[54:46] using to describe the devil so much he's
[54:49] using it to show you what happened in
[54:51] the Bible of how that deceit of the
[54:53] woman come into being all right and it
[54:56] comes down to
[54:58] Mary
[55:01] right and it comes down to the point of
[55:03] telling him the angel did she said I
[55:07] know not a man Angel answered and said
[55:09] unto the Holy Ghost shall come upon thee
[55:12] and the power of the high shall
[55:13] overshadow thee therefore also that Holy
[55:16] thing which shall be born of thee shall
[55:18] be called The Son of
[55:21] God so we see that the SE of the woman
[55:23] would have to be the Son of God right
[55:26] all
[55:27] right now but I keep asking that
[55:30] question and I know I'll do it for two
[55:32] more
[55:32] services why is it call to see of the
[55:37] woman I'm going to do that two more
[55:39] services at least then I'll tell you why
[55:44] okay cuz I got a unique way of my own
[55:46] self I have to approach something real
[55:48] slow cuz I remember how my mind works
[55:52] and I know how yours
[55:55] works we retain 5% of what we
[55:59] hear 1% if we're
[56:03] asleep
[56:05] that's you know all right but see he's
[56:09] going to show how this seed of the
[56:13] serpent becomes swn in the earth and he
[56:15] shows how the seed of the woman come
[56:19] into physical
[56:20] manifestation apart from instrumentality
[56:23] of human male right all right now what
[56:26] does the religious World
[56:29] believe right the religious World
[56:32] believes that Mary produced The
[56:36] Egg and God produced the sperm to bring
[56:40] forth Christ right that's the belief of
[56:44] the world but that wouldn't be a virgin
[56:48] birth no problem with that is it where
[56:51] to be a virgin birth in
[56:54] that and I you know we don't have not to
[56:56] do it to be too vulgar but it's like the
[56:58] prophet said he said then there's got to
[57:00] be so I know you women are going to
[57:02] argue cuz you've argued with me all the
[57:04] years but finally you'll learn one of
[57:06] these days I read some and try to step
[57:09] with knowledge if I can you know how
[57:11] I've tried to explain to you everybody
[57:13] thinks there one egg comes down a
[57:15] month science says there thousands comes
[57:19] down they're destroying your doctrinal
[57:25] thoughts but
[57:27] see think about it
[57:31] then the world thinks that Mary produced
[57:34] the egg
[57:37] right all right now here's the words of
[57:39] the Prophet what did he
[57:41] say he said that would mean you'd have
[57:43] to have a sexual intercourse to bring
[57:46] down the
[57:49] egg now I'm not going to go into lint
[57:52] but if you want to talk later we'll be
[57:54] glad to go to the m to the scientific
[57:57] side of
[57:59] that a woman don't have to enjoy what
[58:03] she
[58:04] does for it to produce a rape case can
[58:08] produce a
[58:10] baby come on try to out be vulgar but it
[58:13] takes the
[58:16] Intercourse to make the egg move down to
[58:20] the place that can be connected so that
[58:22] would mean God would be having an
[58:24] intercourse with Mary
[58:28] that wouldn't
[58:30] work ain't no sense to it so God
[58:35] created the egg and the sperm and placed
[58:39] it into
[58:41] Mary I won't get to it this morning I
[58:43] know now but that's why you call him in
[58:45] Revelation 3:14 the beginning of the
[58:47] creation of God
[58:51] Amen you know that that Jesus was the
[58:53] only
[58:54] begotten yep y Adam was the first
[58:59] creation Jesus was the only
[59:01] begotten amen so if we get anything we
[59:04] got to get it through
[59:06] him that's why he's the first born of
[59:08] many Brethren was in Romans all right so
[59:12] now think about it Mary didn't produce
[59:15] the
[59:16] egg so God by the Virgin birth produced
[59:19] egg and sperm placed it in the wound of
[59:23] Mary and she had a child so we're living
[59:26] in a scientific age
[59:29] now if you can't have children what do
[59:32] they
[59:34] do they can take the egg from the
[59:37] daughter they done it you know back a
[59:39] few years ago like the either the
[59:41] daughter or the son one they took you
[59:43] know this couple and they took the egg
[59:47] from the woman they took the sperm from
[59:48] the male and they put it in
[59:53] Grandma right you know what Grandma had
[59:57] a
[59:59] baby but it wasn't Grandma's
[1:00:03] baby right see the Virgin birst being
[1:00:09] proved that God took the egg and the
[1:00:11] sperm and put it there
[1:00:16] amen that's why Jesus never called her
[1:00:19] mother show me in the scripture now
[1:00:21] listen I'm not
[1:00:22] carnal I I don't claim to be I'm
[1:00:24] ignorant but I don't claim to be
[1:00:28] stupid and when he was a little bitty
[1:00:30] baby he didn't look around you ain't my
[1:00:32] Mama you ain't my Mama you ain't my M
[1:00:39] stupid but when you say that Mar that he
[1:00:42] never show it to me in the Bible is what
[1:00:44] I'm talking about show me in the Bible
[1:00:46] where he ever called her
[1:00:49] mother when she gets down there he's
[1:00:52] about 13 years old what happens your
[1:00:55] father is and I I was reading just the
[1:00:57] other day where brother around said she
[1:00:59] got where she was
[1:01:01] embarrassed she didn't want to
[1:01:03] claim when she' said all of her
[1:01:06] life that she was he was virgin born
[1:01:09] said she got in front of them and denied
[1:01:12] him
[1:01:14] right what did he say he said I must be
[1:01:18] about my father's
[1:01:20] business correcting those
[1:01:23] Pharisees his daddy was a carpenter he
[1:01:25] Eed him to do that but see he never
[1:01:27] called her woman I mean mother he called
[1:01:30] her woman that's right you find him on
[1:01:32] the cross and he's looking down and said
[1:01:34] John Behold thy mother he didn't say
[1:01:37] John take my mom
[1:01:41] home he said behold thy
[1:01:45] mother he called a
[1:01:48] woman short ter in the Bible I mean I'm
[1:01:50] just
[1:01:53] honest but you see what was taking place
[1:01:57] God was hiding from the eyes of the wise
[1:01:59] and
[1:02:00] prudent the things that he was
[1:02:03] doing you said well that ain't true
[1:02:04] brother that well do you tell me how
[1:02:06] come the whole world turned Jesus
[1:02:09] down I mean that would have solve the
[1:02:11] problem okay did they reject him did the
[1:02:15] on that was looking for him the high
[1:02:16] priest that was hollering saying the
[1:02:17] messiah's coming when he the god that
[1:02:20] said kill
[1:02:22] him and prophesied and said it's better
[1:02:24] for one to die for the sins of the
[1:02:25] people that were all to die come on read
[1:02:28] your Bible
[1:02:30] right but Satan knew the only way he
[1:02:33] could do
[1:02:35] anything other than the
[1:02:38] unbelief to be placed into Eve was to
[1:02:42] get her and that Beast
[1:02:47] together and that God then would have to
[1:02:50] come down and do
[1:02:53] something so what does he say
[1:02:58] go back to the quote
[1:03:05] now as the seat of the woman was
[1:03:08] literally God reproducing himself in
[1:03:11] human
[1:03:12] flesh okay so the seed of the serpent is
[1:03:16] the literal way that Satan found he was
[1:03:18] able to open the door to himself into
[1:03:22] the human
[1:03:24] race
[1:03:27] it was impossible for Satan who is only
[1:03:30] a created spirit being to reproduce
[1:03:33] himself in the manner which God
[1:03:34] reproduced himself so the Genesis
[1:03:37] account tells how he produced his seed
[1:03:40] and introduced or injected himself into
[1:03:43] the human race also recall that Satan is
[1:03:46] called the serpent it is his seed or
[1:03:49] injection into the human race we're
[1:03:51] speaking about so what was his injection
[1:03:54] into the human race ease mind
[1:03:58] first then using the
[1:04:02] Beast to bring
[1:04:05] forth all
[1:04:07] right
[1:04:10] now look at the next one look at number
[1:04:13] seven try to get a few then we'll
[1:04:17] quit this is taken from the message one
[1:04:19] this we were on while ago which is
[1:04:21] really a
[1:04:23] continuation so the seed that was in her
[1:04:26] then was a union of an unlawful
[1:04:30] act talking about Eve
[1:04:32] right which was death she was already
[1:04:36] pregnated with the serpent seed because
[1:04:38] she had to liveed with it and she turned
[1:04:40] and said
[1:04:43] herself the serpent beguiled me that's
[1:04:46] right and immediately came come on oh we
[1:04:50] know she said she got a child from
[1:04:53] God right sir certainly every child
[1:04:56] that's born illegitimate or anything
[1:04:58] else has to come by an act of God he has
[1:05:01] to create it
[1:05:03] right Satan can't create soever baby b
[1:05:07] in the world well it's illegitimate or
[1:05:09] whatever it is it come from God God's
[1:05:11] the only one who can give life all right
[1:05:14] he's the only one who can make life
[1:05:16] certainly that is right see she was
[1:05:19] already to be mother and that
[1:05:22] never only what it did was clean up the
[1:05:28] thing of the serpent seed the seed
[1:05:31] that's in you now is by concept
[1:05:35] concepted your unlawful act against my
[1:05:38] word with this thing here and you now
[1:05:41] you are now got the serpent
[1:05:44] seed but I'll give you a seed by
[1:05:48] Immaculate
[1:05:50] Conception and his seed shall bruise the
[1:05:52] Serpent's head and his head shall bruise
[1:05:55] a heal amen just let God have it it it's
[1:05:59] his word he'll bring it to
[1:06:02] P so the first thing in the garden was
[1:06:06] what do this and we'll quit pick up his
[1:06:10] seing first he killed the
[1:06:15] animals and he
[1:06:20] atoned right amen that atonement would
[1:06:23] last of those animals till Calvary
[1:06:27] right but it would not take away
[1:06:30] sin so that was just speaking of the
[1:06:33] coming Messiah and not a direct we'd
[1:06:36] call it
[1:06:39] prophecy all right but Genesis
[1:06:42] 3:16 as I've told you it's odd where
[1:06:45] it's placed in between cuz you're coming
[1:06:47] along pull that up brother and when I
[1:06:49] need Genesis
[1:06:51] 3615 and the before and the after of it
[1:06:53] if you can get it but it's talking about
[1:06:56] the things and all and then all at once
[1:06:57] right in the middle to not but I'll put
[1:06:59] in me to T thy seat in the seat of the
[1:07:04] woman the promise of the coming Messiah
[1:07:08] amen
[1:07:09] right here's what brother around them
[1:07:11] covers it I'll get to it this
[1:07:14] evening so what is he
[1:07:16] doing what we need is the other cuz it's
[1:07:19] it's sorry everybody can read it we need
[1:07:21] verse 14 15 16 cuz that way you can read
[1:07:25] what's taking place and all right right
[1:07:27] in the middle that's
[1:07:29] why I like to stop and say things
[1:07:32] because you know when first time I was
[1:07:34] reading the Bible CU we good Baptist you
[1:07:36] know that's where I come from Baptist
[1:07:38] Church okay and I'm not against anybody
[1:07:41] I just where I come
[1:07:42] from but see we got the gold
[1:07:46] star we read the Bible through so I told
[1:07:50] my wife when I I accepted Christ in the
[1:07:53] Baptist Church I said you know I mean
[1:07:55] I'd read the Bible I knew a little bit
[1:07:57] about it but I said I need to read the
[1:07:58] Bible through not necessarily the gold
[1:08:00] star cuz I didn't care you know I wanted
[1:08:03] to know what God's word said and you
[1:08:06] know what I done I read them things and
[1:08:08] you know what I'm talking about when you
[1:08:11] got over there so far and it said so and
[1:08:13] so beg got so and so and so and so we
[1:08:15] got so and so and so and so beg got so
[1:08:17] and so and so and so we got so and so
[1:08:19] and so and so but got so and so and an
[1:08:20] hour later I'm still so and so but got
[1:08:22] so and
[1:08:24] so
[1:08:26] you think I'll just turn over that no I
[1:08:29] didn't get the
[1:08:30] star I had to read it all but you know
[1:08:34] what all at once I'd find
[1:08:37] something it would be going along so and
[1:08:39] so we got so and so and so and so we got
[1:08:41] so and all at once you read it and all
[1:08:43] at once it' say and God saids it so and
[1:08:46] so and then it goes back to so and so
[1:08:48] but got so and
[1:08:49] so well that's what I'm trying to get
[1:08:51] you to see here and the Lord said unto
[1:08:53] the serpent now he's cursing the serpent
[1:08:55] dust I eat and all the things talking
[1:08:58] about that he done talked about Adam and
[1:09:00] him or comes on down to and right in the
[1:09:02] middle he said I'll put
[1:09:04] enmity he injects right in the
[1:09:07] middle of seemingly an outstanding place
[1:09:11] to put
[1:09:12] it and he injects but I'll put enity
[1:09:16] between thy seat and her
[1:09:19] seat promises the coming Messiah to not
[1:09:23] just atone sin but to AR iate it then as
[1:09:27] I was quoting it last night to the at a
[1:09:29] fellowship
[1:09:32] meeting I love the way the prophet
[1:09:34] explains things it's wonderful amen he
[1:09:37] said there they were going out of the
[1:09:39] garden the bloody skins flopping on the
[1:09:43] legs of Adam and
[1:09:45] Eve and said as they started out the
[1:09:49] gate said he looked down from
[1:09:54] Love and said he saw them going out of
[1:09:56] the
[1:09:58] garden they had the
[1:10:02] atonement but that's all they
[1:10:05] had they had the covering of the Skins
[1:10:08] but that's all they
[1:10:10] had and he said as they started going

[1:13:29] I he's not up in
[1:13:32] heaven that one should go there Paul
[1:13:35] said he's not
[1:13:39] Thee I heard that scripture preached in
[1:13:42] in Ro what is it in Romans that if Thou
[1:13:44] shalt confess with thy mouth and believe
[1:13:46] in thine heart I heard that preached so
[1:13:47] many times by so many different
[1:13:49] preachers and the Baptists and
[1:13:50] methodists and everything else churches
[1:13:52] I got where I didn't even like that
[1:13:53] scripture I'd turn over when even read
[1:13:56] it until I seen one day what it's
[1:14:00] saying God is not up in heaven putting
[1:14:02] this together with this over here and
[1:14:03] just Bray it all together God's not up
[1:14:05] in heaven for us to have to go there
[1:14:07] he's not down in the grave for us to
[1:14:08] have to go down he's not thee he's in
[1:14:12] thy heart and in thy mouth the word of
[1:14:14] faith that we preach that if Thou shalt
[1:14:16] confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus
[1:14:18] Christ and believe in thine heart that
[1:14:21] God hath raised him from the dead Thou
[1:14:23] shalt be saved with a what heart man
[1:14:27] believeth unto salvation or it goes and
[1:14:30] and with a mouth confession is made unto
[1:14:33] Sal way goes on
[1:14:35] in becomes a beautiful picture amen Adam
[1:14:39] wasn't going to leave us I mean God
[1:14:40] wasn't going to leave Adam in the garden
[1:14:43] too many things were said he'd already
[1:14:45] given him eternal life Y and he gave him
[1:14:49] the coats to cover him as an atonement
[1:14:52] then he gave a promise right amen
[1:14:55] but I'd rather have a promise from God
[1:14:57] than all of your
[1:14:59] okays you know I mean you can pile this
[1:15:03] bullet building full of money remember
[1:15:05] when I was a kid they told me how big of
[1:15:06] a place it take for a million dollar
[1:15:08] bills to be put in I thought man I'll
[1:15:10] never see a million dollar bills you
[1:15:13] know but you can pile this building full
[1:15:16] of money what good is
[1:15:18] it give me God's
[1:15:20] promise I'll be with thee I'll never
[1:15:24] forsake you
[1:15:26] to the ends of the Earth You mean you're
[1:15:29] scared of what's going on in the economy
[1:15:31] today and all of the
[1:15:36] things

[1:15:42] be all
[1:15:44] right what is the seed of the woman why
[1:15:48] does it say
[1:15:50] that well it's the seat of the woman she
[1:15:53] don't have a seat
[1:15:56] right all right so that means we'll
[1:15:58] picking up his seed what God has to give
[1:16:00] her a seed righten right yep and that's
[1:16:03] why she said to talking about when Seth
[1:16:06] come along said God hath
[1:16:11] appointed me a
[1:16:13] seed instead of
[1:16:15] Abel that Cain
[1:16:18] slew
[1:16:23] appointed
[1:16:26] Isaac was not the seed of promise right
[1:16:30] he was the natural seed of Promise
[1:16:33] Christ was the seed of
[1:16:36] Promise Isaac just spoke of
[1:16:41] it Christ is the woman the seed of the
[1:16:44] woman right
[1:16:46] amen but I will give you a
[1:16:50] key he's not through with that
[1:16:53] yet
[1:16:56] that seed of the woman is not into full
[1:16:58] manifestation yet that's

[1:17:18] and prudent that's right yeah but
[1:17:20] Brother D you say them people I ain't
[1:17:21] never said nobody's lost you show me
[1:17:26] the only one is lost is someone that'll
[1:17:27] turn down the word of God now when we
[1:17:30] turn down the word of God that's our own
[1:17:32] free moral agency
[1:17:35] right don't you think God knew what Cain
[1:17:38] would do don't you think God knew what
[1:17:40] Abel would do don't you think he knew
[1:17:42] what Esau would do what Jacob would
[1:17:46] do what then can you blame him for what
[1:17:49] they
[1:17:50] done no and we can't blame him for what
[1:17:53] we do so and and we don't even blame
[1:17:55] Adam and Eve that's right for what took
[1:18:00] place we reach the age of accountability
