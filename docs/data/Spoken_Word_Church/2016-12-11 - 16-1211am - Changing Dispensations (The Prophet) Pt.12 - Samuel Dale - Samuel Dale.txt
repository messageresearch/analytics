Tabernacle that services or anything like I'm asking you how many times do you think brother around preached on Christmas day two times according to the schedule of what they went two times all he preached because he'd always say what we're going to have our services and I'm going to preach to you my Christmas message where you you can go home be with your family well that's what we try to do

other announcements we got right we just remember sister Becca she's not here remember her she's on her job in in Memphis so pray that the Lord would take care of her traveling backward and forth amen all right if you'd like turning your scriptures let's get right on end to the message and we'll try to cut it real short and then we're going to have our fellowship time and eating together so you know remember this Ephesians 1 and then we'll go to acts three Ephesians 1 Acts 3 Heavenly Father we thank you for this time and thank you for these children Lord because they put their hearts and participated in done their parts and show all of the things of what Christmas really means to them it's not a Christ Mass it's not a a time of the world but it's about Jesus Christ and what he gave for us and they sang today and said what they believe you gave to each one of us for Christmas on the 12 Days of Christmas and we we love it and we thank you for it and just have your way now as we read your word you come and speak to our hearts and our lives bless brother Al not able to be here this morning the others and just just be with each one we love you and we thank you in Jesus name amen Ephesians wherein he hath abounded toward us in all wisdom and Prudence having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he hath purposed in himself that in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ both which are in heaven and which are on on Earth were even in him all right now we go to acts three verse 22 and 23 to get our thought from for Moses say truly said unto the fathers a prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you of your own Brethren like unto me him shall ye hear in all things whatsoever he shall say unto you and it shall come to pass that every soul which not will not hear that Prophet shall be destroyed from among the people you may be seated the Lord add his Blessing to the reading of the word and we'll try not to be too long but we're still wanting to I cut this things down that originally had to continue on and we're going to try to uh you know bring our thought to you in a hurry and then get on end with the the time and together now we're talking about changing dispensations and what we're dealing with really now is in the point we went from the dispensation of son of man and you know coming down through and bringing him all the way from the Old Testament into the New Testament and the life of Christ trying not to spend so much time on each one but to get a point all right then we in the last message we begin to talk about coming from we went from son of man and how that he was crucified he gave his life that was the reason you and I can be saved is the son of man had to give his life that was the only way the Holy Ghost could ever come back upon the people because it was bottled up in him all right and but then when he gave his life it released that life to come back on the day P cost into the bride of Christ okay now then coming into and we were dealing the last one see brother R said in the seven Church ages you're dealing with Son of God all right which is the holy spirit it's the Holy Ghost dispensation dealing with Son of God all right now I told you then that we and I tried to cover a little bit but I'm trying to get a point across that in this dispensation now when he was here as son of man Son of God was living in that flesh that's that's fine we know that all right he you could be calling they did the son of David and all that but that hadn't come forth into manifestation right because the Holy Ghost had not been given because Jesus had not been crucified according to the scripture or glorified all right see then he comes from son of man to Son of God in the New Birth all right and he comes into church ages as Son of God not son of man now he's the same God all the time amen when he was here on Earth he was son of man Son of God Son of David Alpha and Omega Rose of Sharon Lil of the valley you know the lamb the the anything that you would want to bring out he was all of that right but yet it was what was being made known for the time because as I said there was no way for the life to come into the church except it be the fact that the son of man had to yield up that life it had to come out of that flesh it couldn't just drop down on people and you know and do because he had already said what he was going to do all right and see then that would make him to where that he would come into the church on the day of Pentecost all right we haven't dealt we will take one more message the Lord willing try to pull over a little Sun Monday uh you know this next Sunday to pick up something in that to dealing with the church ages but just think about it he's not when he started the church age on the day of Pentecost he didn't start it off as son of man that's where he asked the disciples who do Man say that I the son of man am all right he said they said uh uh you know we don't know he said finally evidently brother Brown said he looked right straight maybe at Peter but he said who the man who do you say that I amen he said Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God meaning you are the Creator God the Eternal God the Son of God you are all of that Old Testament manifestation coming forth into you know your life and and what you are he was recognizing that but he wasn't recognizing the part called son of man because that was already you know that was a say that it would not be through the church ages as son of man now not meaning he's not the same God right it doesn't matter what age you're in he's the same God but it's what he's doing that's why we're talking about dispensation it's the way God is dealing so he dealt with man as son of man he could heal the sick he could raise the dead but he could not give eternal life to anyone while he was standing there alive that was a dis dispensation all right now then when he gave his life it could release it and eternal life could come into the people but it would be called Son of God dispensation or Holy Ghost dispensation all right and doing that then it would come forth to be something would have to happen because in this now watch my point while he was here as son of man he was the son of God but he wasn't manifesting that are you with he was just manifesting son of man but in this dispensation the last days and he starts this dispensation all specifically as Son of God Holy Spirit dwelling in the people the new birth all right but in this age only you got an overlap we'll get to that and pick up a few statements to bring it along but in this age he's manifesting he he can be manifesting himself right now as Son of God because he's given salvation to people right anywhere Sal is salvation still going on he's the son of God he's not the son of man in that point he's the son of God salvation all right but then to some that are in the message and beginning to catch on to the message and realize what's taking place then it can be moved into and understand the son of man all right now that's what we want to make sure to emphasize today the point of what brother brandham was not the son of man if you make him that you're making him God now how close that was it was close because it's God living in the man right all right but that get to point of what we're talking about during the time of the Holy Ghost dispensation all right a dispensation starting off at the day Pentecost it started off as Son of God it comes down through seven Church ages and right here in the last Church age right in the last Church age you're going to see that the Son of God is still there giving life to those who receive life right but to those those that are in the word he's beginning to change dispensations and will be made known as the son of man all right now to be able to do that now we'll cover this in a minute but just don't don't get too excited to be able to do that would be just like it was back there now listen back there you could not come from as the holy ghost coming into church he had to come son of man to make a way all right now but then it was the Holy Ghost in him that was released to come back okay now in the end time it's going to go from Son of God Holy Ghost new birth to son of man all right now for that that to happen go check and see what for that to happen it's going to have to be that in between the manifestation of Son of God over into son of man that a prophet's going to have to come go back Dar was a prophet but now he was more than a prophet ET but it's going to be that a dispensation has to come into being about son of man and to do that is going to mean that he has to come to fulfill the scripture Luke 17:30 Revelations 10:7 all of those scriptures is to be fulfilled in our day all right so it meant they would have to be a day when God would come on the scene through a prophet and make a way that the son of man could come into view remember we'll get to it in a minute the seven angels not the son of man he's revealing the son of man but you can't make him the son of man see you're making him deity you're going into the wrong thing all right we see then what you're what we've got to do then is to see in this day is the only day that you see the overlap between Son of God and son of man that both dispensations can be here do you understand what I'm saying to those that are coming into the message those hearing the word those that are getting saved today he's Son of God the baptism of the Holy Ghost all right right CU he's not the son of man to them he's Son of God right what I but in this age now is going to go from Son of God to son of man okay because he cannot go remember how we were trying to express it he can't go to the Millennium and Son of David until he comes back to Earth because David is a rain on earth right a rain on Earth okay and being a rain on Earth it means you're going to have to come back a son of man now I I preached this 1969 so it's not a new thing for me to talk about it's great glorious to see it unfold but you see brother brandham cannot be the son of man but as part of the Bride of Jesus Christ The Bride of Jesus Christ will be the son of man or there ain't going to be no Rapture see I kept saying it over and over what why does he have to come back as son of man I that's that question over and over why did he have to come back as son of man see it's more than just say well a Propet would come right it's more more to this than to just talk about well we've had a prophet thank God because without that if you don't get nothing else get this as it was that God Son of Man had to come before the Son of God could come into being before it can go from Son of God the son of man it's going to have to be that God would send us a prophet in the last days all right now if that's not giving him the honor and the praise I don't know what you're going to do with it cuz you're going to come up and say well now it's this or it's that I'm giving him the greatest honor and praise there is as John the Baptist come and what was his purpose what was the purpose of John the Baptist you remember the prophets buildt a body John the Baptist come to introduce the head right which was Christ okay what greater honor could it be than for Malachi 4 to come into being to where brother randam would stand and point to Jesus Christ but then he'd show you where he's at because that's what a lot of people think see a lot of people think it like this you know they got the quote where it said all God was poured into Christ all Christ in the church you know Etc that's plenty of them but see a lot of the the way they do it in the message today all God was he poured into Christ all Christ was poured into brother brandom brother brandom died and took it with him we ain't got nothing to do we just hang around wait till the bus pulls up well now if that's what you think I mean why come to church you understand I'm blame if that's the way you think then why go to church anywhere go home sit down and just wait on the bus but evidently that's not exactly the way that we think or at least it's not the way I think and then that puts it to the basis that the honor is put in the right place what could be a greater honor that brother Ram would say that he was to introduce Jesus Christ to the world and to show you where I'm going if you don't know you're in bad shape anyway but to show you where I'm going he said this messenger would be poting to the skies pointing to a word born bride you remember that statement pointing to a word born bride somebody's got to finish this up there is a dispensation that you're not counting there is a dispensation that the people of this message has never caught on to yet oh yeah brother so and so so I'm as honest as I can be now you get exal say I'm exalted do what you want to I don't care I don't get no money out of it anyway don't make no difference to me see I'm pointing to one thing the word of the Lord there is a dispensation that is not finished Mary only spoke of it you remember I ask you because we're going into that next the Lord willing I ask you to read Masterpiece seed not air with a shook brother R says Mary was not the seed right okay who's the seed that's all I've asked who's the seed well brother Randon was the seed he's part of it because the seed's the word that's right without him there wouldn't be no me and you right how much more honor could you give to a prophet than to say our total dependence is upon what he has brought unto us but not your ideas and my ideas that's right amen when I begin to put my ideas on you come and tell me where my now don't come with baby thing don't come flabber in with baby talk you know when you said this and you said that and you said this and you said that if you can't listen to what I'm saying then you're in bad shape that's right but to try to say it the way God gives it then if you don't listen you're in bad shape that's your choice but you see he was down through seven Church ages it it was Son of God the seventh Church age is still going on you say well I got where the Prophet said to seven Church age end all right I got where he said it's not ended now are you going to throw quotes with me or you going to be sensible and sit down and listen the bride is called out of the age right so as far as the bride is concerned the age is over but listen the bride was called out of every age every age the bride was not in the age you can't put her in the age she's in the Holy Ghost I'm quoting brother random she's called out Luther Wesley all of them irenius Paul Martin Columba all of them none of those ages was in the age of the island where they were living they were called out of that age and to the bride now you tell me if that ain't right well where are we called too we got to be called out of the age was you listening Sunday when I was trying or there the other day when I was trying to bring see when Jesus was crucified back there the Bible said we got to go out unto him he he was crucified outside the gate and we got to go outside of denominationalism to be in him but see the last we were talking about what that he was put out of the age this is the only age we read it this is the only age that God was put outside of he's standing at the door knocking trying to get back into his church ain't that the most miserable pitiful situation you could think about that the greatest religious Society that's ever existed in the world is in the land today there's more Bibles today there's more churches there's more people in churches there's more percentage wise that has ever been and there are constantly more churches forming forming when in brother R's day there was was 969 now there's thousands of churches formed more people going to church today and ever in the RO most religious time that has ever been yet God is outside the church according to the scripture well I just can't understand that because God's in there you don't understand anointed ones then for certain so you don't follow the point you don't listen to the prophet he was he was put out before brother random ever got here they already started denominate forming Oneness Tess threeness foress is and all kind Church of God Church of Christ Church of this that all kind form before he ever come on the scene the word was put out oh no they read it every day right over there boy you got a great Revelation well they're over there crying and shouting Glory Hallelujah and I'm not throwing off on them I'm throwing off on me and you not them now you get that out of your mind that I throw off on them no sir because they got their place they might be a whole lot closer than we are I was mentioning the other day about some of these dying early and going on so you think I'm throwing off on them what if they were ahead of you and you ain't never got to where they were that's the way I think so you remember but they're waiting on you to come to the place to draw them out I'm not de christianizing anybody they reached their place that was all they could do right when you and I reach our place we must die and go by the grave and somebody's not going to do it they're going to be changed well what's going to cause that change oh we're all got to die I give you a quote from R Brown we all got to die right you ever heard the message you heard that right he said we're all going to die but then he speak speaks of a mystery that we don't all have to die see you put it in there and you make me saying things that I've not said I can't help that God showed me 40 something years ago that the biggest portion of people this message would die and go by the grave I can't I may be one of them I have no problem I'm not de christianizing anybody I'm honoring them they've reached their place do you understand what I'm saying yes evidently you and I haven't reached our place right oh we're still alive that's right is that enough yes so don't throw and make me say something I'm not saying I've said it 40 something years why would I back off now because it's the truth yes but did you understand what I'm talking about yes Sunday there on it that he was put out of the church as the son of God that's the hardest thing probably for the human mind to comprehend how that God can be put out of this church right here totally outside the door knocking and Us in here screaming and hollering worshiping and praising Jesus Christ right what was put out the word we'll get to it what happened cankerworm palmerworm Locust caterpillar but remember that was Lutheran Wesley in Pentecost right and then you got the word to be formed see he never was in the age may I quote brother Brandon you don't listen to the quotes that you're reading under that message of can wor pal wor caterpillar and all you know what he said he said the Holy Ghost has been put out of the church for 2,000 years do you believe him to say that I'll be glad to get it for you or I wouldn't make the statement I not that stupid dumb yeah now if he was put out of the church for 2,000 years do you realize what that means that means he never worked in the church the way he wanted to now you go with him you say you believe him but do you believe him I believe him till he make something like that and I don't understand what he's saying oh that's a good excuse ain't it brother hell you just you just confuse me no I ain't confusing nobody I'm exposing confusion he was put out of the church when it come on the day on theusa Street 1906 they started immediately denominating brother renom never come on the scene until at least you got admit it was in the say 30 or something when he started preaching 33 is basically when he come on through you don't have no records until on up into 47 but we know he was back there preaching see God had done been put out of the church if you can't go home pick one of your older T and listen to brother around screaming and hollering where Pentecost failed he said you've put him out of your church oh they want him there to heal the sick they want him there to to MoneyWise they want him because that's what they wanted while Jesus was alive well I just don't understand it because I've been to them Church ches and they just shout Glory Hallelujah praise God I'm not saying they're not praising God that's where you don't understand you're thinking that everything that don't agree with this message is dying and going to hell come on I can quote with you I know what the message say word rejectors go to hell but what if you ain't never heard the message you can't reject it there's a lot of people in this world never heard this message they can't reject the message are you going to make them all lost just because he's put out of the church where was he at he was in the church how was he put out of the church and him in the church it was the word that was put out not the Holy Spirit they want the Holy Spirit they want the healings and signs and wers and to do that R around and said they take so much of the word and it'll work that's right like I said you tell me and brother rown standing up there preaching his heart out crying as he was preaching to the people and said you've turned God down he's outside the church and they get up and worship and scream and Glory Hallelujah and him even come right behind them and say look there's somebody receiving the holy ghost look he's from right over here watch that brother it's coming across this way and he's got through preaching the message that God was outside the church would you explain that to me the only way I know it can be explained is what he's not there as the person of the word that has been put out he's there as the anointing of the Holy Ghost because of the anointing in the end time don't For Heaven's Sake don't make light of any of their worship and their doing because remember if that is the Holy Ghost that's causing them to do that you've got problems with God so don't make fun of them give them their place and leave it alone but find Our Place that's all I've ever preached I sitting last night or this morning sitting there crying thinking about it all I've ever tried to do is just preach this message to try to get the people to see Jesus Christ but you see they'll just turn you down and walk away and you preaching your heart out and then you tell them so come and tell me before you leave but they get outside the door and leave and go somewhere there then they start yakity yaking don't they if you like one brother said I'll never one brother told me in the office he said I'll never say anything against you took him about five or six months and this is what he said he said if you want to know why I left he said I'll never tell nobody why I'm leaving or anything it's right there in the office he come back and he said if you want to know why I left the church call me and I'll tell you well you know what I thought about calling him cuz I'd like to know why he left cuz he told me that he'd never do nothing like that you see you you you get when I do that you get to thinking you're just trying to be exalted whatever I just tried to stay with the truth is it the truth go was put out of the church before he ever even got into the church enough to get it started look at the Oneness people that started before brother random come along that was a move of God wasn't it somewhere about 1914 right in there 12 something it's your Oneness begin to come on the scene and they was throwing Rotten Tomatoes at them who church people church people were throwing Tomatoes at those that started believing the truth of Oneness he had already been put out of the church no wonder they couldn't follow brother random then when he come forth as to speaking of son of man they couldn't follow that and when God began to do the signs and wonders oh yeah they wanted to with the signs and wonders right oh yeah they Rejoice over the signs and wonders oh yes but when you begin to say I and my father one then what did they say well you went too far now if he just have stayed if he' just have stayed who was the brother that went up to him cuz he never really said it but we ought to know who it was who was a brother that went up to brother brandham and said brother brandham I want to pray for you to cast that demon off of you cuz you were just supposed to pray for the sick and do these things who was that brother well you know evidently he didn't believe brother Brandon right is it true see the son of man never even had an opportunity in the churches because he was put out as Son of God then when brother Brandon began to talk about son of man they couldn't follow it it took him 30 something years to be able to preach the statute of a perfect man that's the faith of the father that's back to the word show me one denomination that ever took the word of God I don't care if you want to call them Brites or Lula ites whatever you want to do it show it to me now you turn down the words you turn God down brother brandom in 1962 he was still trying to preach the faith of the fathers which was what Son of God it was why it was so hard for him to try to preach it then he seen that he couldn't couldn't keep on going remember he originally made a statement you know he said I'm not going to preach anything outside of this church he said out s I'll just preach these little things you get him about 62 63 something where right along in there 64 and he says I'm going to preach out there and then you look what he done and look where he went and the churches he preached in and the doctrines he preached in their church cuz why because he knew he'd already been turned down he knew the only thing he could do was bring the message listen the message for the bride right he knew the days was over he said it ain't no more revivals this is the last one it's finished up but then he did say there's one left for the bride right I going agree with it but listen see that's why I've tried my best to get you to see it see he was put out as Son of God out of the church ages as Son of God so when the son of man come unto view there was no way for him to even deal with anything in the churches and if it hadn't been for certain one of those they would have never let him come in churches right okay so what would he come up to be there's no other age thast of the trumpets nowh else was he put ever put out in any age but in the lady you see an age because they said we're rich and have need of nothing see that's the reason that's why it's written like that if you if the son of man's outside and you need him then you can't say I'm rich and have need of nothing you see what the blindness of mankind is bringing have need of nothing and you're miserable poor naked blind and don't know it he was put out of the church first age and then according to Luke 17:30 in the days when the son of man will be revealed he was already put out of the church church had done rejected him just get that in your mind and look at it right they had done turned him down oh yeah they wanted to shout and they want the glory can you see that can you see that God and his word can be standing right out there and we can be right in here screaming Jesus Jesus Jesus and worshiping him that's right no you don't see that if you did you'd jump up and shout about it you don't see it I'm just telling you you don't see it do what you want to you don't see it the way that I'm talking about it cuz you can't turn that down it's the truth we're in the day when the anointing can be poured out right and the churches are shouting more churches today never been but where's god well I just don't understand that well I know you don't understand it but just pray to God to open it to you he's put out of the church now listen to what he goes on to say the unveiling of God and remember between the Son of God in the lady in the lady ofan Church age they put him out and in Luke he said he would be revealed again as son of man the prophet fulfilling the rest of it the prophet okay was brother randam the prophet no but he was the one when God was in right right come on that's very close isn't it but it's still so close he said if you do that so you make me an antichrist look the message a Rapture they can pull these up and I'll run to them fast now we've come through the church ages but we're promised in the last days according to Malachi 4 that there would be a return again a prophet in the land that's Malachi 4 Malachi 4 is a prophet a prophet was to come fulfill Malachi 4 Luke 1730 Revelations 10:7 a messenger was promised to come without him we don't have any hopes CU we got to depend upon that a prophet is promised to come in the land talking about about Elijah and the nature the five times right God promised that would take place and if that didn't take place we better be looking for somebody else but I'm not doing no looking I don't know about you but listen he goes on to say in the message hearing receiving and acting I can pull these up you can read it all he's talking about the Holy Ghost that knows the secrets of the heart we'll see whether the word comes you know we'll in other words we'll see whether the word is who's it come to the prophet we'll see whether the word comes the word of God comes to the prophet or not we'll see that and I'm not the prophet he is he's the one R around wouldn't the prop prophet he was a prophet all of those prophets in the Old Testament were a prophets now watch the tell watch what I'm telling you and you'll see that when it if you'll follow it you can follow it into brother R's Ministry and see right where he went to every one of those prophets all said thus sayith the Lord right how many times did Brother Ram said thus sayith the Lord but the Lord Jesus never said thus sayith the Lord he was the Lord he spoke in the first person because he was the first person brother Brown listen let me get it back in the Old Testament uh in the songs of Solomon he spoke in the first person right they pierced my hands and my feet these he spoke in the first person but he wasn't the first person right but that's very close isn't it what about a th sayth the Lord that means the Lord told you something to go say thus sayith the Lord and see how did Brother randam end up in the end of his ministry he got so close until it was very very close because he was bringing something into being but remember what he had to do when he told sister had it right he said you say it and I'll speak it behind you she couldn't get it come on you say she got it and this she balked evident a little bit he said sister had it right that's thus saith the Lord and when it did there it was see she still couldn't get that straight we're going to have to get it straight or we ain't going out of here in Rapture that's right but he said I'm not the prophet he's the one you believe so then if he's not the prophet he's not the son of man right go ahead to the next one number seven which is questions and answers 1964 well that's a good question because he said some say brother brandham is the son of man I thought the pillar of fire was the son of man am I mistaken well that's a good question you very good but I am not the son of man but a son of man there's quite a difference Jesus was the son of man the Son of God the son of David he's all of them but brother random was not the son of man but the people couldn't get it straight I know what he goes on to say in that message come on down I agreed with you I have no problem until I'm definitely led to do something then I say what I must say but that hour hasn't arrived I don't mind proing that he said I'm not so what is he I am not the anointed son of man I don't claim to be his Prophet many times it said you know what he say preacher means Prophet no next one let me get to you I'll just read them fire off the message of trial he said what it would be the son of man not not not the son of God God now the Son of God in a son of man who was brother randam a son of man God was using a son of man to bring his message because it goes to what I want to read this one go ahead to number nine it be in the hours that the son of man will be revealed on Earth not Son of God no more son of man come back as the prophetic message for the last day when that eagle will be flying not the lon not the ox in the sacrifice age that eagle but just remember now you got to hold that because if you make him that eagle you're making him that Prophet which would make him the son of man and then you're going to be in bad shape when we quote the next quote not off of here but where brother R said he was making way for the Eagles Laurel oh but but brother Dale you're just taking it too far uhuh we ain't went far enough okay look at the next one the only want the end time he's talking about in that very day that the son of man is revealed Revelations 10 1-7 read it when you get home the seventh Angels message opening up the seals what is it not the angel is the son of man but the messenger is revealing the son of man watch him can you get it separated now that's where it seems to be so hard for you you see not the son of man himself but the seventh angel the seventh messenger is revealing to the public the son of man because it's left the shook he can't organize it it's a grain I can understand listen folks I'm human being but if You' have said in the presence of that man to where that everything that you turned around he was just telling you all about what was taking place and what was going to be and all like that I can understand why they could believe him as being God I have no problem I can understand him because I'm saying it this way it doesn't matter biggest portion sitting right here today we would all get confused enough to have problems if we sat under that Ministry like that man was one that gets me really was a great one is when brother Brandon went to that Indian reservation and they had a bunch of Indians trying to supply apply for go government Aid orever what it was you know you know the story but they couldn't prove their birthday they couldn't prove their birthday now let's don't be stupid because remember the government had some records They had records listen to the story they told brother brandom said they can't prove their birthday he said bring them by here one at a time he stood right there and gave them a birthday you say he just gave them a birthday you don't know no he told them the birthday they was born on it wouldn't matter what else they was born and you know what a lot of them is like and I'm not throwing off on my aunt I loved her but you know my aunt had nine kids I think it was eight or nine and you know she couldn't tell you none of those children's birthday I'm not joking this is true she'd say odini was born in cotton picking time that JC's born in that big storm she didn't have enough intelligence to give a date but you know what there was a storm go back and find when the storm happened that was when he was born come on get what I'm saying you mean the government the man sitting down there this guy's birthday this guy's birthday this guy's birthday and the government said okay we'll just give him the money money now don't be stupid they had some records and when he began to put them people in place of them records They had to agree that that was that man's birthday they had some records and they knew it was right don't you go down to the go down to the Social Security office and said I don't know when my birthday was but now this fell here beside of me he going to tell you when I was born well they going to laugh you out of the place but if this guy can tell the day of this happen or whatever and say I can't remember what it was but said you remember there in 36 when there was that great big flood they say yeah he's got something to put it on don't be dumb in what you're taking don't just take things as haphazardly as of this out of the other those government people knew what run around and was talking about they had some records and they gave those people the money but God gave him their birthdays how close was it to him being God but you can't make him God if you do you messed up your whole Bible God was in the man using him using him but listen God was in balum uhoh what balam said was the truth and what balam said is in the Bible am I right oh now you get the story to what it was the angel was not the son of man the seventh angel is revealing to the public the son of man what's the next one we'll quit it then this is number 10 a so go ahead and pull he said I wasn't the one that appeared down on the o on the river I was only standing there when he appeared I'm not the one that performs these things and foretells these things that happens as perfectly they are perfect they are I'm only one that's near when he does it I was only a voice that he used to say it wasn't what I knew it's what I say what I just surrendered myself to that he spoke through it isn't me it isn't the seventh angel oh no it was the manifestation of the son of man right because it was taking place it wasn't the angel his message it was the mystery that God unfolded it's not a man it's God the angel was not the son of man he was the messenger from the son of man the the son of man is Christ he says we're not feeding on a man we're feeding on the body word of a man which is who the son of man right let me give you this one though to make sure you don't lose where we're going go ahead with the next one which is works his faith expressed see I like this I like to bring out things to make you think well brother Dale you're seen to be pointing to a bunch of people cuz we've listened to you we've kind of figured that out by now that after all these years you seem to be pointing to uh because that was what I said in 69 that the Bride of Jesus Christ would be the son of man not a son of man he would be the son of man see I don't mind then giving you this watch as it was in the days of Sodom so shall it be in the coming of the son of man now watch him in the days that that the church is being revealed how close is that he says no this is not the day of the church being revealed because remember church is a word you can use for all churches all people are called churches this is not the revealing this is the revealing of the son of man where he he to be revealed where is he to be revealed it was once the uniting in the time and sign it was once done in the form of the son of man on Earth and he had to give his life to bring about a power to unite other men with this same power for the Bride of Jesus Christ there's a difference in the church and a bride but I have no problem with him saying that about a church because it is not me and you being revealed I have never preached that I've never preached that it would be people that's being revealed it's God in the people that's being revealed the son of man is God now where he that is left up to him and I've never preached it it would be in one person it' be in a bride around the world Christ returning in the form of the word message trial working in human beings and showing the signs that he promised it would sign it would do Jesus in The Bride form same power same Christ same thing I've never pointed to an individual or people or whatever I point to Jesus Christ but now when he points back and shows you where that's at I have no problems with it either there's where our problem is we're not accepting what he says about us you can differ with me all you want to but you better swallow that statement we're not accepting What God Says About Us may I example it he says by Stripes we're healed so that means we're healed right we're just not accepting this reason we're not healed right when he says we are the body of Jesus Christ we're just not accepting that and brother Bram says and I know I made a statement brother random the one that said it he said the bride was the fullness of the godhead bodily oh of course you're going to listen to that are you going to listen to the big man that's passed on but yet I wouldn't have said it if I didn't hear him say it on a tape he said it like this he said you say the bride is the fullness of the godhead bodily he said hogash I didn't say it brother Brown did he hog washed brother brandom not me of course who's going to believe it you know who's the only one that's going to believe who they really are is the Bride of Jesus Christ that's right you'll believe it God it's impossible do you understand what I've drove at for since 1969 to say that the Bride of Jesus Christ is the son of man brother BR said the godhead is not complete without you he said no leaving among you brings the fullness of the godhead body you know what leev is denomination of ideas you know what denomination of ideas is the worst for us right now is to not believe who we are cuz that's Satan's tactics he ain't driving no Trinity down our roads he ain't come Among Us here he's never done it here he knows that he can't bring it a couple of guys come in here trying to produce some things and they got out because we would not follow after they're cunningly divided fables because we just wouldn't believe it I didn't come out preaching the bride would be would be I didn't come out pre brother brandom's the one that come out preaching it if I can quote him why can't you believe him well I just don't see it well does that make it wrong you couldn't be be like like one brother did one time he was up somewhere sitting he told me later he was sitting there and these two brothers were talking about brother Dale and they was saying brother Dale was wrong here cuz he taught it this way and taught it that way and brother said he told him he said I know brother Dale and he never taught it that way well you know what I shook his hand and thanked him for at least standing up for me but you know what he evidently believed that I wouldn't trying to bring it that way well I just don't know I just don't know well okay listen the greatest Christmas gift to me that could ever be given to anyone is Jesus Christ coming into our hearts and living in the new birth of eternal life the next thing which would go with it in this age and be part of it would be and you'll follow me what I said this age has got to have Son of God and son of man it's got to come in together the greatest gift could be that would be this message that we have the opportunity to read and believe but do we read it believe it like that it is God speaking to us or do we believe it like well let help me I I can't believe it as being this God's word well there was a whole bunch of men wrote this Bible do you believe that come on you say yeah but I know where brother around I know where the Holy Ghost can show us where he was missing it at but he'll tell you he misses it so don't worry about it yes but I I just what going back where you come from but you see Church the greatest Christmas thoughts could ever be is to have eternal life in our souls and to have a message that God has given us that has stood the test of time time it's out there I put it out you come show me where brother random missed it at I've done that ever since I started when it opened up on internet I just knew for sure that we was going to get lambasted to hard until there wouldn't be enough internet to take care of all of the end and comings to do it I've had a couple of little silly things sent to me and most of them was brother Dale you didn't understand brother so and so cuz he didn't teach it that way well at least let me be one thing what do you like it or not or anybody likes it let me be one thing I tell you what I believe and where I got it at come show me your doctrines where you got them at but see church this church is not built on a man or what he's doing or any man that says anything these church is built on one thing and that's the word of God you see me off of it you come to me you're Duty bound to show me where I missed it I don't know what else I could be than to tell you that away that way is my love for you the greatest thought that I could ever think about of anybody giving me for Christmas would be to believe God's word and stand on his word that's the greatest part could ever be for me to believe him and try to give it back to him he stood my place he took my place in death he took my place in everything all he wants us to do is take his place and stand upon his word for the end time right that's the greatest gift that could ever be given to anybody is to believe God's word may I quote the scripture you want to do the works of God how many of you remember that scripture you want to do the works of God what is the works of God what is the works of God youever read your Bible what does it say The Works of God is to believe them that are sent read your Bible if they get a chance can run up on the screen works of God what is to prove that we're the Seed of Abraham Abraham believed God's word what are we supposed to do believe God's word what greater thing could be you see then I set my heart when I took over as Pastor we've always tried to give a little something and all to honor the people here but I set one goal one day and I heard brother Brown say it like this he said I wish I could give everybody a gift he said but there there's no way well we know that he couldn't look at the millions have to I set a goal to not just give every person but they've always done it ever since we've been here we've always since I've been Pastor we've always give a silver dollar to people holding an office and I've asked you to just keep them and one of these days we'll see who's got the most CU that's honoring you as you're working for the church and the do it we T try to give everybody that comes to this church some kind of a gift everybody that call listen let me state it correctly because we can't do on the world and do everybody that call this church their Church home we've always tried to give them a gift we've been able to and until we get where we can't we we'll do it give you something for honoring you because that's a great opportunity if we go into the part of that now we wanton to anybody want to be prayed for we'll make sure we don't leave that and I thank God for these children can we give them one more good hand these children have put their lives over the years together and made it a great thing from the little bitty ones up to the big ones I get so tickled we we at home sometime we when when we turn on thing we don't fast forward everything you know we we'll sit down if we got time
