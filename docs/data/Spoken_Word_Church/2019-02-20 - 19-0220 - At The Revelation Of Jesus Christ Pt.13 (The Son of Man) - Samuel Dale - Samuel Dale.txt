working it is anything else good to see everybody in the house of the Lord you'd like to turn in your scriptures turn to first Peter 1:13 and then we'll go to revelations for now they they may not have revelations for back tyre but they got a couple of other scriptures but we'll go to revelations for one our sister Kathy Gabriel said for us to please remember Michael and he'll be in Guam for three or four weeks need to leave in February you might in most meet him it okay I at least had a bad reason he said be leaving in February to feel - March of 17 so pray for Mary you know being by yourself and everything remember her just keep her in your prayers it's good to see everybody we'd like to try to bring this stop - not too close if we can now if you have questions and answers if we have them time tonight you can cover them but if don't you can write it down and we'll try to cover it you know to see if there's anything that needs to be covered is the main thing so that'll be your part but now this coming Sunday I'm going to Lord willing the way it goes right now I want to speak on something that I believe will be interesting for all of us and I would ask you to come and let's see maybe we can get some things to where we can look at it a little bit better and you know believe it but there's think on these things okay father we thank you for this day in your grace and we just ask you to help us and Lord to guide us in your grace and let your light shine father in our hearts that we may see you and want to walk in your love Lord just come down and touch this old back and make everything alright it clean us up in you that we may walk in your grace we love you and bless the word bless those that are sick you said you sent your word and healed us and delivered us from destruction so we thank you and just have your way Lord that's your light shine into our hearts in Jesus name now with all the topic Sundy but if I were you I just try to be here that's the best way to say if you can't at least get to take listen to it okay first Peter 1:13 or for a guard up the loins of your mind be sober and hope to the end for the grace that is to be returned to you at the revelation of Jesus Christ okay now let's go over to because I gave him a couple of more scriptures but maybe they can pull it up on revelations 4 1 & 2 all right after this I looked and behold a door was opened in heaven and the first voice which I heard was as it were of a trumpet talking with me which said come up hither and I will show thee things which must be Hereafter and immediately I was in the spirit now remember you get over in chapter 1 remember he's in the spirit going to the Isle of Patmos and he's now he's here and he's getting he's in the spirit and we know what this represents because chapter 4 represents the rapture it's the going up of the bride all right but think on it now and immediately I was in the spirit and behold a throne was sitting and one sat on the throne you may be seated for that is blessing to the reading of the word now what I want to do is I covered it Sunday we listen to it again and trying to get our thoughts in mind to line up the word and you might order to keep these notes you'll especially that keep them you know and we are putting it on the internet that they will be getting all the notes tonight whether I read them or not alright and see that'll make it to work that at least they can understand maybe what we're trying to bring alright I said I'd try to cover a whole scope of the Pais 1213 messages try to bring it together for understanding purposes for all of us to see where we're at and what's taking place all right now you remember we started off in Revelations one and God said now I want you to know John who I am before I show you anything all right I wrote around and explains that on the Patmos vision you know all right he said I want you to know who I am now who is he this is supreme deity this is the Lord Jesus Christ speaking to John to bring the word run said that was the Lord appearing to John alright and the first thing he then covers once he gets that done I told you a secret to keep in mind if you would listen to it that what I would do would try to cover it and come back to this point all right now coming back to revelations 113 where it says there's one in the midst of seven golden candlesticks like under the Son of Man I said don't forget that because we're going to come back to that but we're going to come back to it in the last days now that's our point tonight is to try to get it down to where red and brother Branham says on the seven search ages says not a man this is a woman Girt about the paps he said it's the gospel that held the power and glory of God over the body of Christ all right now that's an odd thing to look at that you're seeing once then admit seven golden candle is like unto the Son of Man and then he describes what that is that it's the glory of God all right so it's it's bringing it to a position for us to have an understanding all right then we went on to why are we are not a denomination in brother branham's says and he turned to see one he saw one like the Son of man standing clothed how was it it was a bride standing in two candlesticks draw it out all right now remember our point back there was he's showing who he is which was the Lord Jesus Christ all right then he's showing where he's going and what he's going to be doing all right and he started to church ages now that starts chapter two all right so he's showing where he's going and what's going to take place and showed how beautiful perfect that he showed the bride that before she ever even started the ages what she looked like to him you remember that I'm trying to bring the point C to word that we can see the one standing in the midst of seven golden candlesticks is the Lord Jesus Christ in bride form or I are in the form of the bride or in Morphy the Bride of Christ coming forth to be not the son of man like that to be a person because if you'll remember in the book of revelations now think of this thought as we go through you don't see him as a person you see him in the Book of Revelations as a form he's in all right so you say yeah but he comes with here you know yeah but there's a form there he's taking a form for us to see it alright did the Prophet say this he said the Book of Revelations is like the acts of a play alright if we see the acts of a play you know what that means you got a scene then you go through it and you're never seen you go through it saying you go through it you keep on going to the end of the story alright now so we come up to her that we were talking about that the Prophet said on how can I overcome that where he's sitting on the throne he's not sitting on it he's sitting in the throne right not on the throne see it's in his domain all right now then being in the throne the baptism of the holy ghost all right now let's back up a higher now that's what I said I try to cover the whole thing let's back up a little bit you remember the Prophet told us that he always he comes in three sons names sort of man son of God son of David all right now so you may not have understood why I emphasize so much that you can't go from son of God to son of David I'm not emphasizing as much as I'm telling it like it is that's what your prophet said see something that's to happen in this end time that is to show us the way of all of it and what's now so only his strong then we went through I'll review these in a second what is the father strong is the baptism of the Holy Ghost right that came on the day of Pentecost he was on the earth now listen to this point and follow it the Old Testament gave birth to Jesus Christ right the prophet said to you know the Brethren said the prophets built the body all right John being the last one to introduce the head and then there he stood all right now when he came forth he came forth as son of man not son of God he came forth the son of man so the Old Testament gave birth to the son of man right now watch the point they gave birth to the word that's the son of man right Jesus was according to John 1:14 was the Word made flesh all right who is he then he's the son of man but now isn't it a hard situation to think about that when John introduced him he didn't introduce him as calling him the son of man what did John introduced Jesus as behold the Lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world all right in that Lamb of God what would he be a kinsman redeemer right which would be then once the Son of Man so John introduced the son of man but he didn't introduce him as this to say he's the son of man because all of this is in mystery and parts of a play and things that's got to be put together but he introduced him as the Lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world now don't forget that and don't forget that that Lamb of God is who the Son of Man the Redeemer the kinsman all of the things that goes in okay now he gave his life then release the life - were that not his strong he spoke of his strong his kingdom but it didn't come forth back there it had to be the Father's throne first Father's throne is the baptism with the Holy Ghost so the Lord Jesus as I tried to explain to you many times he came and gave His life to release that life that was within him so he goes from son of man right to the second stage or second scene of your movie that you're making or whatever you want to talk about that's to help the children to see it you all right and he comes from the Son of Man the Son of God the Son of God now is not his throne son of God is the Father's throne that sounds odd to be look like it would be maybe the other way but that's the way it's been explained and that's where your prophet explained it all right the baptism of the Holy Ghost is the father strong the son of man the Lord Jesus Christ as acting out two parts of the play for his part you know the scenes of things he comes forth as to be her kinsman you know and as he does he releases that life that life comes back into the church on the death any cost it comes back a son of God see they couldn't understand that when he said who two men say either son of man Peter said dark the Christ the Son of the Living God all right watch the point upon this rock I'll build my church and the gates of Hell can't prevail so he said you didn't understand what I say it I asked you who you say the son of man is and said you answered who or what that I'm going to and that's what I've always been amazed with the perfection of the Bible because what if what if John had her you know what if Peter had said something else me but he asked him who the son of man were he said you're the Christ the Son of the Living God the Christ is the creator God the Son of Man is not the creator he said well that's just all it is it's just all one God but it's the acts of a play or taking partake in place as each manifestation of God we believe in many of those but the one true and living God all right but he goes through son of man releasing the life and come back onto their Pentecost as son of God the baptism of the Holy Ghost all right he comes over into the Book of Revelations and he does what I said there to start with he tells John down John I'm going to show you the future but said first I want you to know who I am all right so he showed him who he was and all about the Christ you know all the things the Alpha and Omega the beginning and the end he said now I'm going to show you where I'm going he said I'm going to a morphine ow change my form to the baptism of the Holy Ghost or bring that BA or that part into being and the baptism with the Holy Ghost would come onto their Pentecost to start the Father's throne or his kingdom or his domain all right but he said I want to show you where I'm going before I say anything so what did he showing he showed him the bride are you with me he showed him revelations 1:13 one standing in the midst of seven golden candlesticks like unto the Son of Man he showed him all the way down to the age that we're living that's what I tried to get to the point to you for you look at he showed how perfect the bride was before she ever sinned you remember I tried to emphasize that because the church ages have got bad and good you got people doing wrong you got things to be repented of you got rebukes you've got all kind of things well yet God before it ever started he didn't just show him starting on the bride he showed him all the way to the end and that end would be when standing in the midst of seven golden candle see like unto the Son of man so he shows that now that once Jesus was crucified all right that he would never be back on earth in a corporal body until the millennial reign right is that the words of the Prophet we meet him in the ire he doesn't come here we meet him in the earth all right now then it'll be a corporal body in the Millenium and he'll be on his throne then son of David okay so then down to seven Church ages then we kept emphasizing over and over each church age gets the revelation of his deity each church age gets a explanation or a defining of what they're the overcomer of that age would receive then he comes down and he writes the ages and he brings us through the seven churches okay down to seven Church ages it was son of God because that's the baptism when the Holy Ghost in the people but in this age now if you want these are the father whatever you know I mean what you need if you needed father's strong he is sitting on the Father's throne now this is from the message the identified Christ of all ages it's been when he died rose assented sit back the Holy Spirit that was the son of God now this is identify Christ of all ages number ten if they pulled it up for another God is experienced through the church ages it's been son of God and then in the Millennium that son of David sitting on the throne ruling he has ascended up he that overcomes to sit with me on my throne is I've overcome and sat down on my father's from he is sitting on the Father's throne now but in the Millennium he sets a process upon his own throne because he's the son of David now he is the son of man son of God son of David he's all of that but it's showing the acts of a play if you study the book of Revelation and talking to the chiropractor today about it he said why you don't appreciate my said well I'm in the book of Revelation he said well almost everybody kind of shines away from that I said it's one of those wonderful things for me I said it's according wants you and what you can understand I said if you just think about it it's being the acts of a play you know what else can you say to somebody like that but that's the key if they just think he said hey that's good just the acts of a play being unfolded he started it work started it back in the creation of the world and come down through and he would speak man son of man son of man all the prophets but he only spoke like once or twice a son of God like the three Hebrew children one lakh under the son of God all right he would speak of that but that son of man would be coming through so if you were making a movie you would be bringing him up from the Old Testament and one day a baby would be born and that baby would be the Son of Man the Lord Jesus Christ God in human flesh then you'd bring him up through his life and then you'd bring him to his death Calvary and releasing of the life and it would change forms he would in morphe from the form that he was in into the bride to come down through seven Church ages as son of God the spirit God dwelling in man father's strong new in the Millennium he would be the son of David what is it the same God all the time just changing his mask right all right now he changes his mask so down through seven church ages now you got him as son of God now how are you going to get to the Millennium these are is the key that man doesn't understand and I'm just as honest to say it to you the people of this message don't understand that because I'm too honest to tell you I've listened I've never heard it you said well ice exalted we'll do what you want to about that that ain't got nothing to do with me when I preach the gospel I preach from my own point I don't care what anybody else believes none of my business what anybody teaches in their church and what they do I'm not on the internet to try to correct anybody I preach if you want to go on the internet you want to listen that's fine that's your business we just remember I'm not your pastor if you call me and bite me your pastor send your tithes and that'll be you I can be that pastor thataway but I'm not gonna try in no way to pull people to the message but I've taught this all the way down to try to get people to see it for over 40 years to see this point of what I'm illustrating tonight how that God changes his form from son of man the Old Testament prophets gave birth to the word now if you look go to masterpiece she's not out with a shocked birth pains you hear all of these things the Prophet is saying alright and see if you don't then you say well I can't understand that well you won't go listening those times so it's not my fault see I'd do everything I can i crying praying he even told bro that once you said I don't you standing up there hurting I don't care this gospel has got to be preached if it's preached for my bedside let it be I want to see the word made alive it's got to be made alive in this endtime people sure we saw it for a moment in the Prophet I mean oh I didn't see it but some of you did you saw that and have always tried to illustrate it you saw the the master of the world for a moment when that bull wasn't laid out who was that God in that man not the man the Hornets that was God doing that showing it but he was showing what he's gonna do this in Thai bride that's what people don't believe you know how they quote it like one brother said they quote it all God was reporting the cross all crossing into brother Branham and he died and took it with it then we've got nothing left you see you're not talk like that why not it's what a lot of people believe because they're sitting around now well we don't know what to do hey we faced it some of you were old enough I wasn't Darwin the Prophet was there but by 68 what was they doing wondering who do we follow are we supposed to follow brother so-and-so is he the son of man it's either this is either that or is he the Elijah who's there I appreciate brother Billy Paul coming out there one day when was up there he came out cuz everybody says who is Elijah who's Elijah he said I just listened to a tape the other day and I know who Elijah is he said called my daddy said Elijah this day was the Lord Jesus Christ well that helped a lot of people who didn't have everybody cuz it didn't change nothing but now listen let's get a point follow my point now the Old Testament gave birth to the word which was the Lord Jesus Christ the Son of Man that's why he kept referring to himself as the Son of Man he didn't refer to himself as son of God that was not the office to come into being at that time he had to die to release that that was within him that could come back on the people to bring the kingdom of the baptism of the Holy Ghost back into the church which then would be God or as Paul said it Christ in you the hope of glory same God with a different form a different manifestation so goes down through seven Church ages as son of God in Watchmen gamma as the old testament gave birth as the prophets gave birth what was happening in the ages in the church ages it was coming forth and molding that body Jesus Christ then who is about if you you are the born-again believer is the body of Jesus Christ right so it was coming forth molding that into being and the life would strike that a little man would walk out there and he'd start preaching and as I've emphasized over and over don't mean a thing maybe to you but he sure does to me none of those people understood son of man Paul and in the embrace of it it's like a mystery it was hidden and yet Jesus priests constantly son of man son of man son who's the soul or the seed how long could we stay on this for years because you can go into the masterpiece and all of those things because Jesus Christ is the story of the seed according to the Bible the Son of Man come on then here comes a prophet in the high stage walks out and what's his purpose to sow the seed now our wind spoken-word original seed so the seed of the entire Bible right was that brother branham's purpose or his manifestation or whatever you want to call it here's part that he was to bring and you see then right during the lies - of ending up of lady of SIA that here comes a profit on the scene and ever service he's telling that son of man son of man son of man son of man he was claims that he was son of God through the ages within the last days has got to come back to a different form now there is were your catchiest see everybody says there's only three sons night and that's quote from rota brown am I gonna give them to you three sons nine son of God I said oh man it's Oh God son of David but then to find what he says to get the answer to the situation that gives hope to be able to go from son of God to the millennial reign or to get there remember there's got to be a rapture there's got to be a change of these bodies there's got to be all of that before the millennium comes into being right and in the Millennium he sits on the throne it's not we are there with him as the bride but I tried to explain to you do we look at her throne we want to try to get everybody up on the throne let's sit down in our thoughts know the baptism with the Holy Ghost is the throne of God in your heart and soul and when it comes to that in the Millennium there'll be a throne just like over in Revelation 4:1 it comes to a throne you take Revelation 4:1 now you got a hopes of being able to connect between the ages and the Millennium the Old Testament gave birth the word what do you think this is for the bride across to do I mean or do we just sit around here and walk off or wait on this or we don't matter whatever I mean at least at least we could try to live so that Christ would be happy about this age we've listened to another day I've mentioned it many times but around talking about the Azusa Street people he said they were closer to the coming of the Lord and we are now what was he talking about he wasn't talking about the word right come on he wasn't talking about the word they didn't have started it started being returning but what's he talking about the lives they were living you reckon that might be the reason we're here fifty years after the Prophet maybe it's in that connection all right but let's start right here okay brothers go ahead to the number 12 and we'll pick up and try to get her thought if I'm a little over I'll try not to I just want to bring this to a conclusion to where you can look at it and you'll see what I'm talking about whether you believe it or not that's up to you it ain't up to me to reveal it I can't do it I didn't reveal it to myself and the Lord showed me in 1969 if the bride would be the son of man I've told that over and over people - oh you just he's not know I've always said it like this everybody's always told off on brother Peregrine all he just a bragger he's a bright guy says he's been to 164 countries well you know what I say it and I wouldn't have cared for anybody told him what I said I said if he's been to 164 countries he ain't bragging he's telling the truth if he's been there but if he'd been 263 lied because he said he was 164 so that's how easy it is to be a lie all right see I tried my best to get two people to see back then the Word of God okay but listen let's go to number on we want number 12 which is God's provided place of worship all right roll it on up to where we get to coach you can read in between a lot son of man into the church will come through justification through Luther through sanctification through Wesley through the baptism of the Holy Ghost are the Pentecostals and go right on into the perfection of the Son of Man oh you mean there's more than just a the Pentecostal baptism of the Holy Ghost you're in bad shape if you don't know no better than I I'd invite you to go to masterpiece and listen to your prophet when he said Mary was not the seed she was only a carrier of it he said cause the seed is the Lord Jesus Christ now did he mean Mary didn't get the baptism of the Holy Ghost no she did get that right it means what this is not the seed he's the seed he's everything listen to him through the baptism of the Holy Ghost or the Pentecostal and go right on into the perfection or the son of man that when husband and wife will be the same self persons God will be so manifested into his bride his church till they'll both be the same they are one now you see where we're at now we start right there to see a point if the Old Testament gave birth to Jesus Christ now what's going to give birth to Jesus Christ in the last days are we going out of here of a flowery bed of these and got nothing we just are we just floating along we just you know I always say waiting on the bus to pull up or something huh no maybe we were to realize what's taking place the reason that we're here you know he's always been ready but what did the prophets say said he's waiting on the what his weight said wasn't the readiness of the bride now the readiness is of the bride would have to do with the opening of God's Word so if you see what I'm driving at then we'll read the quote driving it one thing the Old Testament gave birth to the word which was the son of man he shows in Revelations 1:13 what it will wind up being in the after the church ages is over in the end of it and it's one lakh under the son of man Girt about the paps for the golden girl because it's not in the bride coming back to be a physical neither did the prophets give birth to Jesus Christ Mary gave birth come on if you're gonna be carnal I'll be carnal will you the prophets never gave birth it was Mary that gave birth when she gave birth to the world that was brought to her and she said be it unto me according to thy word and she gave birth to Jesus Christ now the Prophet said then go right on into the perfection of the Son of Man when the husband and bride will you not together all right you see what is expected in this life days and like I said it it odd with the odds and I say that's all right it's just odd to me that before he ever started talking to the church ages he showed where the bride would go to to be one standing in the midst of the seven golden candle see like him to the Son of Man rode around said the bride draw it out who's gonna give birth I thought your prophet said she's to be delivered of a new birth from according to Malachi 4 I said birth names I'm pretty sure all right see what do you saying brother Dale is far we've got to give birth to the word no no no brother Adam doing that now the Earth's word you're wrong because you're making him the son of man well brother Dale you preach the bride right what I preach it as the Prophet said it because there's not a physical coming of the Lord Jesus Christ to be here until the millennial reign so it will be the acts of the play it will be the opening of the word it'll be just what I said the prophets of the old kept bringing that word it kept building that body starting with Abraham Isaac Jacob Joseph and all and it just kept building and finally one day John stepped out and said behold the lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world what did brother run say in the church in the spoken words original seed he said this prophet will be pointing I'm pretty sure it's not but I know I'll find it for you he said this prophet would be pointing to the skies at the word born right you see yeah but brother Dale you've always preached like bride bride said you you seem to leave brother branham out of it hey we wouldn't even know what to talk about without him he'll get that off of you get that part away from you to think that we're trying to do away with the bride because that's what I'm trying to place who introduced Jesus Christ who called him the Lamb of God the take away the sin of the world the Elijah of number three right John the Baptist so that shows you the play and the acts and what it's going to be it's going to take one to come in the end time to introduce Jesus Christ yeah he's not not what your prophet done you come to introduce Jesus Christ they said that's where the people can't keep it straight he said I'm not the son of man he saw I am a son of man I've gotta clean here will read it them in here he said the son of man is the Lord Jesus Christ and no way in the world am i trying to preach something that elevates the people above their God I've tried to make that plain when it says they were thrown I made it playing there's one on that song you got to put the rest of us around it yeah but not on it cuz we're not the king and even the Queen don't sit on the king's throne she has to sit beside of him that's alright but in the natural but she don't get on the king's throne as she does she's King the church John introduced the lamb in other words he brought forth I brought into the open this is the Lamb of God and the lamb of God stood after and told who he was the son of man now there is no physical coming I've tried my best I was listening to that yesterday we would there is no way that you've got any Bible or the prophets message in any way to bring anything about the son of man because you know coming physical Perl because the son of man is the Lord Jesus Christ and we meet him in the Millennium we meet him in the air going to the marriage supper yes but he doesn't come here in a corporal body but he's got to have a body see when we leave out of here he'll have a body he'll have them two prophets standing here with the word that's where wager on that I wish you'd listen over and over brother branham striking that in the seal book and striking those two prophets and opening that seal you remember what he said he said I had to get up and walk out come on are you listening so what'd he say he said I had to get up Walker you know why because he knew that if them two prophets was gonna open that seal he knew what was taking place that day in his own life he was not the Son of Man but telling the difference was the body butter I'm talking about me and you've been God he said only difference is the body right he's the body we can't beat the body by the way no physical we can't make her body but we're the body of Christ the body of Christ down through 7 Church ages gave birth brother Branham was not the messenger of Lady of seha come on we've been through that you think he was he said he wasn't he said you'd make me wrong if you make me the messenger he said no see he's 2 when it comes at the end of the age he coming to end of lady Oh seal not at the beginning we've been over and over and over to try to get you to see it but what did he say go ahead to number 13 brothers because he's got to come back to do something God he's got to come back in the end time to be able to do a work and take us to meet Jesus in the Millenium cuz we're supposed to be that right is that true now we're supposed to be there on a honeymoon with our husband in the Millennium is that true we Baptist out that not using the wording like that as much but it was the fact that he was the to be the son of David and that we sat on the throne with him listen I've told you over and over whether you like it or whether you don't like me at all that's alright but we ain't gonna get on the throne it's got to be in the throne and you know what that's already here right now the baptism when the Holy Ghost is here right now not to wait one of these days no it's not one of these days listen to what he said he's coming down congregation so had to come according to the scriptures a prophet now watch that in a second hold on to it he never called himself the Son of God he called himself the son of man the Prophet is the Lord Jesus Christ alright but now he is through the church ages now he has been son of God in the Millennium he'll be son of David sitting on David's strong but between this time now what time to quotes who got in between the times now what time in between the Son of God and the son of David he's coming back for just for a moment hey don't miss me up then cuz brother Brandon was the first one started talking about son of man so you know where the emphasis is I put it that's so close just don't make it go over too far and you'll make him deity now I was like I stood up Jeffersonville and the man standing out to her said you you believe brother Branham was deity said this brother I pulled over I said that brother there has a baptism with the Holy Ghost and you were if you'll agree with me that that's deity standing there by the new birth I'll agree with you brother branham was deity oh no I said forget it I turned and walked off his point was not I was putting it I believe every born-again believers deity is that the words of your prophet but you see we're not that beauty huh in the Millennium he'd be son of David sitting on David's throne but between this time we find out by the scriptures evidently he must have had it lined up he is to reveal himself again a son of man a prophet then you can start with brother Branham in his ministry but it'll climax in the earth son of man go ahead to the next one what is it that was off of the then we're going to the unveiling of God notice now I'll tell you a little story behind this most of you heard it what you see I know that I'm technical I know that I'm arrogant and hateful and sarcastic and anything you want to put on there you don't have to worry about it I know I'm that all right but see it always bothered me when he said three sons now son of God I mean son of man son of God son of David well I knew there was something wrong in my understanding or you know he was wrong in what are you saying oh you mean you thought like that yeah and so did you so don't look at me you did too you thought he was wrong and something he said until it was revealed to you all right but you see we had an old time battery-powered which would Electric would work but it'd run off of batteries a tape recorder to play 70s reels most of you remember them and so we they was like five of us riding to work which one was not even in the message but he had to be listening and one day he said if we're gonna listen turn that thing up where I'd hear it alright cuz he just died life and the things brother Brennan was telling you no but we all had a time of choosing a message like I take Monday than those two you mean to order well for about three days or four days in a row nobody brought an extra message I was listening to the unveiling of God I said Lord say something that I ain't getting because I realized that there's three sons named so no man so no God son of David no how are we going to get to the son of David there is no way of just picking up something and laying it over the heart the last day three or four days in a row here it came I finally got it you read it notice now he came first as the Prophet with you and they crucified him now who is that the Lord Jesus Christ right lisanna plan his own crucified him he came as the son of man then after the Holy Spirit came he was then the son of God God is the spirit he was the Holy Spirit son of God he lives through the church ages at son of God now in the Millennium hit me son of David sitting upon the throne of his father David he's the son of David now cuz he is - you and I are going to understand you know at sickens me people say who do you pray to do we pray to the Father or do we pray for the son or do we pray that the Holy go he never had people to say that to you who did we pray to see if we don't have to explain to him who he is what has to be explained and who we think he is or our statements are he knows who he is well when the day comes that we know who he is it'll all be settled rah and remember between the Son of God in the labium States in church age they put him out and who did they put out they put really this message out right they put this prophet out right but who was it being put out did he not say one day he said it's not you they're against this mean that's how close it it's very close but it's still not not close enough to make it to be what we're talking about all right and remember between the son of God in the ladies in church hey they put him out and in Luke he said he would be revealed again as son of man the Prophet fulfilling the rest of it see the scriptures type perfectly together son of man son of God son of David what was it it's the same God all the time just changing his form in morphe he just changed it's a great drama to him he is acting it out and see coming up there's got to be okay then you got to sex him clean him but you can read that see where it was rejected and what does he do now now what does he do now return as son of the man I see nobody knew that you know what I'm talking about your denominational people I still don't know that with your theologian they didn't know that he was to come back a son of man cuz they could count three sons named are we is that the way the people the messy do it three sons none brother Dale you're making four out of something and I love this but it goes sour but they'll say four you got son of man son of God son of man son of David that's Fogler and a four is an antichrist number you know it's direct quote but force an antichrist number black white yellow I mean white and gray you know you got four but remember also four is the number of restoration justification of Saint case and baptism of the Holy Ghost and the word let's see we're so smart all four words an antichrist brother the hell they don't understand these numbers he's an antichrist number evidently your prophet didn't understand it because I'm reading what he said okay I kind of think he understood it don't you see how close we are son of man son of David son of God he is revealed in the last days the son of man according to Malachi 4 all the rest of the prophecies pertaining to this hour no more dealing with the church i-tree they put him out on the outside knocking at the door some predestinated seat in there yet he must get to them the in-between now we've got hopes of understanding because we got something in between son of God and son of David I don't like it worth something but heaven help me the son of man is gonna come back in the life stage that's according to your prophet the son of man is to come back in the life stage but where's he going to be where's he showed in Revelations 1:13 the people you don't read and listen you know that brother Branham says revelations 1:13 is the same as a revelations 10:1 you need that same as revelations 10:1 revelation of 10:1 is a angel standing there and see we put it all brother Branham come on I told you winds died Sunday where I stand brother Branham is not least on a man but he was a son of man okay now but remember he is also a member of the body of Christ now come on and you'll get why that when the angel appeared to the man back there and said brother Branham you were higher no wonder he's a born-again believer he's a manifested son of God he's an adopted son of God he is a prophet no wonder he's greater than any of the rest is that his statements are you listening and remember between the son of God in the lady you see in church age they put him out and in Luke he said he would reveal it be revealed again a son of man the prophet fulfilling the rest of it return back is sort of man okay now give me a little time and let me read some time because I've had these in the front of my Bible says 1969 and this is the things that I was trying to preach dark and read it from the Prophet so let's go to 15 the trial cusan 1964 Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever and he's identifying himself as he promised much more could be could we say in these last days as son of man making himself known among his people amen the Prophet started it but as I was bringing that there never wrote around him as a part of the body of Christ and I didn't make the statements were brought around and said they that the God here is not complete without you why don't we realize that yeah but that makes us too much too much of what if God says it why can't we believe it much more could we say in these last days of son of man making himself known among his people in the form of his people no that's all for brother branham hey he's the one saying it what are you making him you make him all of it he deity but people is that what you ear this you know okay remember I didn't start this today so don't you think I started picking on you cause you here tonight I taught this for over 40 years ago of the same notes as son of man making himself known among his people in the form of his people would that not be in the in more fee of his people all right see not son of God not son of David but Son of Man the Son of God was the supernatural see if we stay on the Son of God we're not going anywhere it's got to go farther than son of God you got to have something to put between Son of God and son of David and that's where it's at go ahead number 16 serves we would see Jesus and there was one the other was one to call elected church that was showing the sign that God was in flesh Jesus was God in flesh and if Jesus is in you tonight it's still God manifesting himself in the last days the Son of man revealed himself in his church in his church he didn't say to his church we know that's automatic he had to be revealed to his church iris where the Prophet come into being look manifesting himself in the last days the Son of Man revealing himself in his church the human flesh making himself known you get it see God down here in his church making himself again the word the son of man being revealed in the last days as it was in the days of Sodom 17 crises identified jesus said noticed in today's when the son of man shall be revealed being revealed in the last days it'll be like it was in the days of Sodom garden manifested in his church the human beings revealing himself see in human flesh like he was then no look now this for throwing out on the Internet in case of the a lot of people think I won't say this but I said it's far the Internet people I sure hope it's not here but a lot of people think brother Branham deliberately blinded people by saying things well I'll agree he blinded he blinded me to my old denominational thinking and I hope he covers my blinded eyes do you think he did you think he said things to blind people don't do that go ahead 18 which is the trial down at the bottom you read in between all of this you know you know where I stand read between see if it don't fit I challenge you to believe that Jesus Christ is revealed in the form of son of man in human flesh through the bride's body worthy to be revealed in the bride's body are the body of the bride is that Alright come on keep on going mighty God unveiled before us Luke the seventeenth chapter I believe in about the 20th or 21st verse them were a longer he said and when the Son of Man is being revealed the Son of Man back in in in the church again revealed in human beings plural now not son of God but the Son of man again back in his church again in the last days we find that he promised that in God's promises go ahead proven his word he promised these things to happen in the last days that the same son of man will be made manifest and remember that was not Jesus talking to Abraham Dyer that could discern the thoughts in Sarah's mind you know who it was it was no charity right that was not Jesus he had not yet been born but it was a man in human flesh that Abraham called Elohim the great almighty showing and Jesus said as it was in the days of shot him watch close in the days of Sodom so will it be in the coming of the Son of Man when the Son of Man is being revealed not no more as a church watch see not no more the bride is called in that day the Son of Man will be revealed what to join the church to the head unite the marriage of the bride the bride groom will come rod groom call will come right through this when the Son of Man will come down and come in human flesh to you not to two together the church has to be the word he is the word and the to unites together and to do that it takes the manifestation of the revealing of the son of man not a clergyman I don't know I do you see what I mean it's son of man Jesus Christ will come down in human flesh among us and will make his word so real that'll unite the church him as one the bride and then she will go home to the wedding suffer it manifests the son of man again not Church theologian theology dude I said theologian yeah what theologians the son of man the word and the church becomes one whenever the son of man whatever the son of man done he was the word the church does the same thing what about it what about it do we believe it he said yeah but brother Dale we can't get it straight what are you talking about okay let's emphasize again I go back the old testament gave birth to Jesus Christ he was the word lease on his man he gave his life to come back into the church to give us the baptism of the Holy Ghost to save our souls and would make way for the Father's throne to come into being the son of God and then he would come over in the last days and reveal himself again as son of man which he would start out in Revelations 1:13 1 lakh under the son of man heard about the pouch for the golden girdle he said it was the bride draw it out what is it now the bride is to give birth to the word the word is Jesus Christ and we were to give birth to that word what did he say you become the word as you receive the word alright perfect thing okay now listen Church for just a second now in no way ever said anything that I believe in derogative points against brother Branham and anything I've always stood upon my basis all the way through I've always stood on one thing to know without God sending a prophet we would have no hopes now can I help it that before I ever heard this message I was 18 years old and I told my wife I was reading a Bible I said according to what I'm reading there's going to be two prophets come before the end of the world so they had Malachi three miles off for so when brother Moe started talking to me about prophets since I mustn't wait just a minute now would you mind explaining times go see I knew how the Baptist explained Malachi 3 they explained that correctly which they couldn't explain Malachi 4 they just made it's the same thing flopped it over all right brother mode he started talking about son of man I said we're not why test a minute would you tell me who this Melek I 3 is he told me I've done that to try to get a make sure he understood where we were standing and what I could get her what he was saying he explained it it's John the Baptist that's ok now who's this Malachi 4 because I was looking for two prophets I didn't have to wait to come into message to get the Hat I received it from reading the Word of God why can't we read the Word of God sometimes of our own sense and come out with something out of it let's see when he explained my Licata for I said okay no problem he said eyes dire seeing the dead raised the sick healed us brother you've heard me tell this to original I said brother I wasn't there I believe you he said well you know Robert tell them is right I said we know that items they're wonderful people moving back and before ever heard of the message means that he said there's they're insane I said yeah but you don't understand I'm trying to tell you I can't take what you say but this is what I've told him I said you tell me what he talked and I'll know whether he was a prophet or not thank God I run into a man that could quote three-quarters of the Bible half the message and didn't just jump up in my face you gotta believe brother branham was a prophet are you gonna be lost he went through the scriptures the one God the water baptisms you know what I said about the Godhead he asked me said what do you believe I said I believe in one true and living God Jesus is his name he said how do you explain it I said God three persons Blessed Trinity I said because that's the only way we could explain it he said if your person your personality personalities and individual individuals a person so your Trinity like everybody else I looked at him I said don't believe that in the more I didn't have to wait to the lights turned on the how about something hollered at me or visions or dreams or whatever I knew the word said it but can we put what we've got on the word I've had to put my whole life on this word this message because I believe it I've seen it live too so that helps all right that helps to see it live but the word is right if you understand what I just doing I just put a the Bible now I'm going back into the message we talk what was it we taught in that the writing of the Bible do you remember that that was message like one two or three the writing of the bow you realize that we went through the Bible tonight to go through the Old Testament come out of it with Jesus Christ to start the New Testament come all the way through and come out with it being Jesus Christ standing in his people and there's no way that we would been there without the introducing by the prophet of Malachi 4 there's no way we could be anything without that and giving all glory and honor to that thanking God for what we've heard but what about it is the son of man just brother Branham no I've tried to make it as plain as I could the entire body of Jesus Christ which would mean Paul Peter giant you know I mean all of these coming up all come together in the last days because it's going to be a resurrection and they're part of this just as much as we're part of this and remember what I told that ever age inherits what the other ages had so this age when it comes up to say to sit with me and my throne that's 11th hour people that come forth to receive the same pay as the first people God to get it to her that we can have the Word of God revealed unto us and that word revealed is the son of man it's the son of man leaving and there's that Old Testament produced Christ the New Testament must produce Christ our elsewhere is he coming far to take us are worthy coming from to take us that's as simple as I can make it worthy coming who coming watch they do it alright but then do you follow me what a wonderful thing to think about that there in Revelations one he said before I tell you or show you anything I want you to know who I am I'm the Alpha Omega the beginning the end they all I'm all of it and then he says now I'll show you where I'm going I'm going into the church on the day of Pentecost and she's going to be my body and I'm gonna stand in the church ages as not to be a physical standing but to be the word revealed and each age had the word reveal for that age and without any of those you're not gonna make it you think we don't need this we don't need that uh-uh we're standing on that just remember whatever you think our roots is Jewish right our roots were Jewish it hadn't been for him coming in do it no words in the houseful you know that's what I loved were that God knows all of our thoughts than what we're going to say even if we make him smart sarcastically he knows those thoughts I thought Abraham was agenda I didn't know he was a Jew I thought he was a Gentile you didn't appear to over in Jude and like second Kings or something it didn't even appear though Abraham who are you the man looks at him one day and he's walking down through there and he said who are you he said I'm Abraham he said you're a Hebrew now you start the Hebrew tiger because you know what it meant look up Abraham in the Hebrew and see what it means it means one from the other side of the river that man seen him cross up Euphrates or whatever it was and he said you're a Hebrew but I love the Bible he said I brought your father Abraham from the other side of the flood reach you Bible we want all these seed doctrines and it's that and the other and don't even know how to read the Word of God he didn't see if he didn't say that so I brought your father Abraham from the side to fluid understand that well the region Bible see if it said it maybe be like a man down at work was one day me Oh God not a wouldn't it that it was brother George brother George oh the guy he told him something and he said I don't know what I said in the Bible or not he said we're gonna read you Bible and find out and some time later he'd run across the same guy and he said did you ever find out in the Bible he said no but I found a lot of other good stuff so we could at least find some good stuff in the Word of God you see Church it's not because of this that the other it's gonna bring the devil after me and you it's because of the opening of the work it's the opening of the word is gonna brain Satan after us with the opening of the word comes a restoration of power come on come on Satan you can't do nothing with us it's too late what hurts my heart is to hear these 4050 years in the message and preaching and then now they're up preaching something else that might not tear your heart out but it does mine I hope it's what the Bible says the Obama knows a sign cry for the abominations done in the city so I don't throw off on these people I don't make no fun on them was post pray for him we're supposed to pray for him pray for those that just by flee use you what about it come on musician I've done a little quicker than I thought but let me make this final point while they're coming I believe the son of man which is the Lord Jesus Christ in ever form except his corporal 16 element corporal body is here right now not now not coming he's here well I don't see him open your eyes now listen let me make this statement I'll end it with it caught them on the end of series on this point if the Dead is raised the sick is healed now I hope you understand the Bible says if a prophet come and give you a sign and it comes to Pais you're supposed to believe him that's one Scripture but now there's another scripture that right see if a prophet comes and gives you a sign and it comes to Pais but he takes you to another God don't listen to that prophet another God is another revelation or another one what do you think what do you think about it I think and believe that the bride of Jesus Christ I'll make this table cut if I don't know I don't think I'll pick them up but if you'll go to the mighty guard unveiled if you'll go to the scene on air with a shocked masterpiece you'll hear brother Branham telling how great the bride is you know he says that the fullness of the Godhead bodily is in the bride today you're making the bride too much no because you see I'll never be on that throne no matter how close I can get I'll never be on that throne you will never be on that throne because that throne is reserved for him and him only because we exalt him I told it chiropractor today I said he starts off in Revelation saying I want to tell you who I am I said he's the Lord Jesus Christ that come to John to give him the word he said that's wonderful see we hear it and we think no it was brother Branham had done this it was rough it was I've made myself clear but around him is not the son of man he is not the Lamb of God to take away the sin of the world from now the Lamb sitting on the throne is the lamb he's not brother Branham and he's not me and you try to take a book for each other come on the Lord Jesus Christ took the book open the seals listen hands them down to the seventh church age message sure right i'ma quoting him takes the book open the seal hand it down to the seven churches messenger the seven churches messenger is the Prophet to declare and I ask you a question here while by I said what part of this book is sealed it's ever bit sealed until you're born again every page is sealed the Prophet had to preach a lot about this Bible to bring forth the faith of the father before he could go into the opening of the word for his own message that he was to bring I've got a quote in here if you want me to read it to you got ready to either day but run said the head and body we not together in the last days to bring the message he said to bring the message he said I've got this one big nuggets and I'll break it down and let the ministers take it on I don't blame anybody for not going after most of the ministers it's in this message because I wouldn't either I love them everything in the book I ain't gonna put everything I got behind something that I can't be assured that it's right so you've got your choice as to believing where the word is here it's not and the best thing to tell you is one time if you don't believe it you need to go somewhere where you can find it because we ain't got much time I mean that's just honest or if nothing else we're gonna die naturally so they no time to play it around try to be able to big this or big that it's to try to build up Jesus let's team well we got brother Amandla a sink 404 inspire any questions now you turn to me and I'll try to cover him all I want to do is so glad I'll his love for me Jesus paid the price every district on the cross of Calvary
