that's not the Holy Spirit that's for sure it'll test your spirit but usually you know usually Delta doesn't cancel flights so while I was telling y'all we were leaving Sunday to go to the airport he was sitting in there shaking his head and I thought well you stay in another day but they had canceled this flight on the phone so so we uh took him down to the airport and put him up in a motel there and he got home just fine to West Palm Beach but he said he had a really good time I really enjoyed being with him I hadn't seen him like I said in a long time so but he sends his greetings he made it home safe my way of announcements uh this coming Sunday the 7th we're going to have one service in the morning regular then the second service will have a vowel renewal service a baby dedication or a dedication of yourself if you want to do that and then we'll have a baptismal service the pool is ready I just cleaned I drained it cleaned it and it's filling up now so it will be ready to go and

anything we just had a biopsy a year ago and it's but it's concerning anyway it's not normal so let's just keep that in prayer the guy uh the doctor wasn't so concerned um but I got to go back in a couple of months and have another blood test so let's just pray that those numbers are back down as we get older men you know what I'm talking about so just uh keep those things in our prayer we all are falling apart and on the outside but let's build ourselves up on the inside hey man unless that let that man take over all right and he won't need a uh he'll never need an operation and thank God he'll never have a blood tests because you know what we've already been our blood's already been tested it's the blood of the Lord Jesus so so we appreciate that so let's bow our heads and remember Dale fabush's family I know that um it looks dark but it ain't dark till it's dark right so let's pray dear Lord we thank you for this evening you give us thank you for the the time we have to come in the middle of the week Lord and I pray that you'd refresh us just for a few moments I'll be with the father's family Lord and just touch Dale's Soul father and and and be with him Lord and his wife and different and the family Lord I pray that you would just be with each one that's not here sister Freda different ones Lord that we always think about Lord we pray that you would just raise each one of them up father for your honor and Glory you're the Healer you'll never stop being a Healer till we walk into that new body father I pray that you just touch each one Lord that's here today that may be sick Lord into different things we pray Lord that you would help us that this weekend will come together and and and get all Minds clear all Hearts clear and and as we're going to speak just a moment about reconciling through water baptism through through um vow renewals and Lord we want to renew our vow to you father because you're our husband you're a husband you're a father you're all the different titles Lord let's see you tonight as our reconciler the one that brings everything back to where it's supposed to be you're the only one who can do it Lord we pray that you'd just bless Lord the ones in the Foreign Fields we think about them Lord doing their job and we pray that you bless them in the Philippines in Jamaica and the different places India that we support I pray this should be with them Lord just take care of us in the first of all this service you take over lord and you have the preeminence in Jesus name we pray amen part 105 in the beginning was word words with God and the Word was God and that word was made flesh that's so important that we see that the word Everybody's scared when you say flesh when you say flesh everybody's like no there's no way you know the flesh is you know it's just evil and it's well in a sense it it will be sticky until the time that we take the body change but we got to start somewhere believing that what's inside of us is stronger than what's on the outside of us and what's on the inside of us is gonna what it's gonna showcase itself on the outside and our flesh will be changed we're not going to be changed into rocks and and stone and and paper no we're still going to be flashed for an eternity but there's a way that we have to get there and that's what the prescription is Brother Willie was talking about this weekend there's a prescribed way of doing things and there's a prescription and you've got to go by that prescription you can't go any other way because you know why he saw that that was the only way that was needed for us to get that way to get to get to a body change it would be held as glory to glory the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth it's second Peter 1 and besides this what besides the new birth besides my beginning of Faith besides my uh as we're going to speak in just a little bit about you've been reconciled in your soul but what about the rest of you all right because reconciling brings it all back together not just pieces all right and we'll talk about that in just a minute because brother Brown says we go way up here until we have to have godliness till God requires these things why because we're not as close to God as we should be even at Faith we're not as closest to God as we should be I mean were you satisfied today you got born again no that just started your journey that just started your yearning to want to be more and to have more of God and besides this in other words besides your experience besides your born-again experience giving all Dylan just add to your faith virtue into virtue knowledge and all his Temperance tempers patience patience godliness excuse me godliness brother the kindness and brotherly kindness charity and we'll get to that in just a little bit so let's have a seat and I'll I'll read this first Timothy 3 16 it says without controversy I like that scripture without controversy in other words in other words you know what Paul said Paul said I'm not going to stand here and argue with you I know who I believe and I am what persuaded that he's able to do that in other words without controversy great is a mystery of godliness so so now watch you can take that and go all right well that great is the mystery of godliness it's so far out there we can't get to it no Paul brings it right back in and since God was manifested in the flesh justifying the spirit scene of angels preaching the Gentiles believed on the world received up into Glory now where is he now he's in me and you actually came back into us as we're going to speak up just a moment about uh that just came to me a few minutes ago about reconciliation what am I saying reconciliation does one thing it repairs our relationship when you reconcile with your wife or you reconcile with your parents you haven't met them you know you hadn't talked to them for years because of some XYZ and then it comes back and and you reconcile back it brings you back into Fellowship well God now when you get born again you are coming into fellowship with God but you're not in full fellowship with God there are things that God is not going to touch until you get rid of them amen no they're not going to touch just like brother Brown preached doors indoors he steps into your house you let him into your house but you close this door of Pride and you close this door of this and this door of that and you don't let him in well he wants to get in there and clean that house up but he will not knock the door down because you make a choice to let him or not to let him but that word controversy is without Strife without dispute without quarreling great is the mystery of godliness and then brother will he talked touched on the Plan of Redemption which began all the way into Genesis and it tells us it did not change the plan never changed so the plan was exactly but thank God he did it by what Romans 8 29 though though for whom he did what number one he forew R4 no he also did number two predestinate okay I see what you're gonna do now I'm going to predestinate that to come to pass because I've already seen it come to pass to me that's so simple that's why brother Brown could stand in the pulpit and he could stand there and he said he said I see you as a young child and you were run over or a dog him he's watching their life there is no guesswork to it they were saying it was mental telepathy well mental telepathy doesn't always work because it works off of sometimes you know your psychiatrist Works off of what you say and then what they're learned or taught to do they react in this way all right that's just like the people that call you and people call a guy called me one time and he said he said Mr Dell he said I've got this plan for you and he says he said I got this service and you know 100 and something channels and he goes into this big spell and I said well that's great man I said I'm not going to tell you that that I have another plan I'm not going to tell you that I use Comcast instead of what you're I said I'm going to tell you I don't even have a television Dead Silence because he's reading down you know if you say this this is what he's supposed to react if you say this they've got a predetermined script that if you say this we say this well there wasn't one on there that says I don't have a television because he said oh and I said you may think I'm lying just to get you off the phone I said but I do not have a television that's hooked up to any kind of cable okay thank you click you know he goes on to the next person but that's why the one he foreknew so God he predestinated by what he saw he already knew what was he didn't guess what was going to happen brother Brown didn't guess what was going to happen he saw what was going to happen and actually he saw the word of God being made manifest in a bride in a vision of us walking marching where upward he saw us he saw us marching towards something oh yeah we might get out of step and we have got out of Step but he saw us marching and and going forward and and why can't we get into that vision get into what he saw play our part so he4 knew it but so he by by foreseeing it he could predetermine everything and as brother Brown said that was a bad word to use because predetermined is you were predetermined by God to be here tonight because he saw you billions of years ago sitting here tonight that's the way he predetermined he didn't predetermined because he made you come here now he gave you a desire he gave he gives everybody a desire to do something and then what does the world do they drink it up and they smoke it up and they peel it up and they this and that and the other that's what they do but what do you and I do we come to church to hear from God because that desire is there and brother Brown said if there had to be if there was a fish there had to be water already there so if you have a desire to be born again healed saved Sanctified filled with the Holy Ghost there's something there for you tonight to get if you desire it and he saw whether you desire or not so we can't fool God right so he predetermines by what he foresaw and I can understand that I got it all right and I hope you do too you've been taught as brother Willie Smiley uh we were talking about afterwards and uh then today I was talking brother Andre and um I want you all to understand something brother Dale may be my dad my my my blood but he's helped so many people that you'll never know he helped us sure but he helped so many people that you'll never know until we get to the other side that's been in that's been affected I say even infected I like being like being infected by God but but you hear people talk about things and how that they wouldn't have been here if they hadn't been here and how Brother Willie Willie stood and and and told us about because we were talking about the the uh the doctrine that some of the great people are you know have been preaching for years that Adam had to put his natural seed into Eve's womb to save her and he said I heard your dad the first time say that you know 15 18 years ago and he said that stuck with me and he said I knew they were wrong okay well praise God what if they heard something else like everybody else heard something else got to give him a rose while they're here but I tell you it's it's uh ministers don't you know sometimes uh Bob was struggling Wednesday night I know that and sometimes you know it's like you're preaching to cardboard people and and I'm just being honest and you know it's just it's going out there and it's coming back it's going out there and coming back but somebody is paying attention somewhere somewhere he said if you'll preach my word it'll not return void it will accomplish what it set out to do and as you and I know many many times we have sat and even I well I'm going to just admit it I've sat down and brother Dale's preaching his heart out and I didn't get a thing that's great of what's coming out you know I it wasn't for me but somewhere down the line something would ring later on as we process what's going on we go like Brother Willie he heard that Doctrine he hurt and sat in the meetings how the great brother you know I say great brother he's well known the message would preached that Doctrine and he said it just didn't ring true to me he said then I heard your dad explain it 15 18 whatever 20 years ago this stuff's the old hat I don't want to say old but old but but it's old hat we've been going through this for a long period of time but but just thank God when you set some time and you don't think nothing's going on nothing's happening well maybe it's not your time to have something happening but let somebody else don't stand in the way in but let somebody else have something all right hey man well I said before when you pray don't you don't so much pray for the person that's okay you can but just pray that you don't hinder them you can handle them from getting healed so listen take me take me out of the equation take my sin and my bad thoughts and all the things that I did the day before and the day of all the fights and angries and all the things I got into take that away Lord so that you can flow to that person and let their faith connect with God's faith and then get something and not me and you standing away like a cardboard doll and just stand there and you know keep God from working I don't want to ever be where where I'm accused of of stopping somebody from getting their healing or stop somebody from getting their salvation I don't want that and I know you shouldn't either all right that's why we pray when we get here we try to get here a little bit early so that we can you know get that stuff out you know kind of let the washing of the water the word you know you listen to a prophet just listening to a profitable drive a devil crazy hey man you listen to Brother Brian I mean if you have a little something going on in your life you're going home yeah yeah yeah you just start you know get a little nervous and then that thing leaves you and I thank God you think I'm crazy what did David do when when Saul when Saul was vexed with a with a spirit he called David in David played the harp and the Bible said the evil spirits left Saul amen so let's don't Discount Music either so and the song leader said thank you very much all right moreover whom he did predestinate then he also called number three and whom he called number three then he also Justified and whom he justified them he also glorified now all this is made by this one little word right there Grace it's all through Grace by grace are you saved through faith all right so the grace of God is what saw you right here at number one he saw you on it more than you wanted to go do this and that and the other more than you wanted to drink anymore you know sometimes you just got tired of being sick and tired right we always say that but I got tired of being sick and tired and when you do that something is going to you're either going to become hard shell and never make it back are you become so soft because remember he gives you a new heart that sanctification not at the new birth that sanctification to soften you up so he can speak to us the word of God in the same way with the sanctification that we're under now we're under the second work of sanctification not the sanctification to get cleaned up to get born again if you're if you're already born again you don't need to get cleaned up and get born again again all right that's why I say I like what a minister said he said look all these people that get baptized three or four five and six times he said what happens is he said you just you know you'll get a bad thought or you'll have a bad Daniel so I think I need to get rebaptized no you don't need to get rebaptized you need to repent just repent and go on we're gonna have a baptism we baptized several over again and that's okay but sometimes that water will not wash your bad thoughts bats in that it won't Wash It Away you need help somewhere else you don't need help in the water now in the water way is the way to go it's a way to get started we can't go around it but once we go through it let's don't go back and go through it again Let's cross that River and continue on whom he justified he also glorified by grace are you saved through faith now watch what brother Brown says so foreknowledge looks back and says that what he foresaw what this this right here and he knows that's the reason he could tell what the end was from the beginning and therefore knowing that all these marvelous days that we're living in now you know brother Ryan he tells us he said he's been 30 something years waiting on to preach to Statue of perfect man it's been in the Bible for two thousand years all right those virtues have been in the Bible for two thousand years and they were written by people that were involved in those virtues that the virtues were flowing the prophet says flowing through their life but then Satan the effects of the word got to eat down oh that's okay you don't have to have uh you need to have worldly knowledge not the knowledge of God no you gotta have the knowledge of God and therefore knowing that all these marvelous days that we're living in now and to stand and witness and see the things same way with me standing here today and you sitting there today where brother Brown preached this when in 1956 wow that's what 50 60. 70 years ago almost what if we see what are we seeing now that he didn't even get to see what are we seeing now that he didn't even get to see and he's saying we're seeing these things now and witnessing now and see the things that we've seen God had to make a preparation for it and he foresaw a group of people that would take this message and live it right just plain as a day there's somebody gonna make it amen amen and just you just gotta say it's me God you saw me then we were the little conversation we all had about um you know you you look out in them and on the internet and you you listen and you watch when you see people that that don't have a lot of background like we were talking about tell us that we don't have to have a choice anymore that we don't have we're not a choice we always was this well that to me that just takes Redemption out of the way then we always was this great something and we always you know we never did no you were a sinner I sinned but watch what brother Brown said watch how watch how wonderful he says this if God did that in other words bringing you here making you a healthy guy God's seen so in you when you were young and pretty and women has got old you men who are young strong and healthy how you enjoyed being a man your low companion if God did that without you having any say so into it now see that looks like you didn't have a choice well listen you didn't have a choice to get here he's going to tell you that but once you get here the reason they put you here he made a choice how many millions of sperm died when you were conceived how many eggs died you were conceived you didn't have one thing to do with that but God had to get you here that way because of what happened in the garden he had to get you here brother Brown said he read this one to this one this one this one to get you here in other words to get your character here to get your person here so that he can deal with that person into set time and then knowing that we have to go through this statue of perfect man he put a group of people on the Earth that can live these virtues in the darkest hour not the first church age I'm talking about the last Church age you and I our commission is to live those things just like they did back Peter James and John we love them we appreciate them they're gone We Are The Living Word made manifest today they spoke of us every prophet in the Old Testament spoke of you sitting here tonight that they wanted to come to this they wanted to be able to live what they were saying David didn't live what he all he was saying all those psalms he wasn't perfect he was a murderer he was a liar he was an adulterer not a good poster child for Christianity but God loved him God knew his heart he knew he didn't want to do those things same way I mean you he knows we don't want to do things while we're while oh I'm sorry if y'all haven't done anything wrong since you got born again okay well I'm sorry well I skip all that I don't think so we sin every day you make mistakes every day but now let's continue if God did that without you having any say so into it now that's the truth you never said make me thus who'd take any thought and could add one cubic to a stature but if he made you thus without you having anything to say how much more can he look through his brooding give you a choice and you're on the basis of free more what is free moral agency number one it's free boy that takes a lot it says right there free moral and who's the agency you and you are a moral or an immoral person but you have free will inside of you to do what you want to do even now when you're born again tonight you can be better or worse and you're on the basis of free moral agency you can turn this down or you can accept it now that sounds to me like a choice that don't sound like to me you're gonna accept it and that's just the way it's gonna be no you turn it down is to be lost and remain potash and calcium and petroleum but to accept it and to have a new heart a new spirit in his Spirit part of the logos part of that John 1 1. in the beginning was the logos and the logos was made flesh and the low glass was made flesh in your flesh right part of the Locust in you controlling your emotions what are we dealing with to me as brother Jack was talking about you know having battles in the wars well that's your emotions right there okay now you can have an emotion of having Temperance and be really bad but you can have an emotion of temperance as Jesus did and drove the people out of the out of the temple but he turned around and died for every one of them gave his life so that they could be saved and who knows to take the internet all right just not part of the story controlling your emotion and when he Coos through his word you coup back and answer now why would you give an answer if you already if it was just all stamped and set and dry cut you have to answer listen we'll have to answer him being a Christian we got to answer for the things that we do someday way back before there was ever a light on the earth our bodies laid in this dust look our bodies not our soul if you're born again today your soul was with God and in God if you're not it was somewhere that God had set aside to give everybody a soul is that the only way you can explain it there's somewhere God gives everybody a soul All Souls are mine Satan can't make us all God made Hitler's soul but then what he done he put Hitler on display and gave Hitler a choice and he made his choice and we see by history that he made a pretty bad one all right but God made his soul so you can't blame the devil for making it so you blame Hitler for leaning toward the devil and giving the devil his soul everybody with me way back before there was light on the earth our bodies bodies laid in the dust not our soul you're made from the dust out of the potash calcium petroleum Cosmic light God sent forth the great Holy Spirit to brew brood over the Earth and as he brooded the flowers came up the birds flew out animals came from the earth then came a man now listen that man didn't come up out of the earth a soul he was already that Genesis 1 26th man he was the soul of God because God had pointed that before he put him in human flesh you know you you hear him preaching wall the seed was laying in the ground the seed for your body absolutely but the seed for your soul is in God even your mom and daddy didn't give you a soul they had nothing to do with your life they had something to do with get the shell here but nothing to do with your life then came a man in his sinned and separated himself from The Fellowship Of God that kind of shows to me there was a choice made somewhere and because of this horrible thing he was commanded by God to return back to the dust of the Earth but oh Lord God we are so glad that before he returns you have promised a redeemer and today since he has come and sent forth the Holy Spirit again now he's still brooding over the dust our bodies and if he raised me and brought me to what I am now without having a choice now he's talking about bringing his bodies talking about bringing the person here on Earth to do what to make a choice how much more will he raise me from the dust of the earth after we've made a choice and he has brewed it to us and we brewed back to him we love him Jesus brother Brown said 1959 he says now you've got to make a choice Jesus said let every man's word be a line mine be true now you've got to make up your mind you've got to make a choice and this may be your last time to make a choice it doesn't sound like he always was tomorrow may be too late God might have chose you to eternal life remember he died that everyone may have eternal life life every person even Cain yeah even Judas but if you don't make up your mind and accept it somebody else will take your place what don't seem like it's all cut and dry does it seems like you got a little bit to do with it because if God won't give you the Holy Ghost because you don't want to give it to somebody else I'm just reading what brother Brown said okay I'm reading a quote I know it's before the sales but blah blah blah I believe it's all true amen so backpack back in the back part of God's mind let's you know we quote this a hundred thousand times but he ever been back there you ever been back there does God ever give you a revelation of something you never knew before in your life that it was just so contrary to what you believed that was the back part of God's mind because God does have a mind of thinking now listen I want to tell you something he has a back part of God's mind he has something that he was going to achieve so there's a part that he kept but now remember Judas was in the mind of God Adolf Hitler was in the mind of God but he was a part of the mind of God You and I by the new birth are the very thinking of God can y'all say it man if you're not then so we have been literally back in the back part of God's mind where nobody's been before there's a group listen everybody was in the mind of God where do you think everybody came from what I talk about the souls God said All Souls are mine in other words I am the source of life I'm giving out life not billions of life and he's not no one less person than he was when he gave the first one but there's eight billion people in the world now we've gained another billion God gave everyone of them life to make a choice to have eternal life to me that's so plain but if you're born again tonight you have access to the back part of God's mind where there's a place that he is thinking and going to achieve a motive and he's going to let himself be expressed in you not the world in you everybody with me First Corinthians 6 9 says know you not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God listen the unrighteous are in the mind of God everybody there's not a person on the earth that God said well I never thought of that one amen everything he thought of it all and there is an unrighteous part not of God now listen that's why brother Brown explained many many times that that when a baby is born it's perfect because it that Soul comes from God it can't come from God marred hello come on somebody it can't come marred it has to come perfect and pure because remember perfect is complete Perfect's not that he never pooped he never peed he never threw up he never told a lie that ain't perfect in God but he was complete but he made a choice or she made a choice at the age of accountability to become righteous or unrighteous as we see many times brother Brown tells us and we'll get into that maybe later on way later on when we get up to the to the headstone there are some people that got wrote in a book that got their names erased so they were in the [Applause] Lamb's Book of Life The Eternal section but got them erased because of their choice not because of God's choice or he couldn't say I wish that all listen he wished it I'll be in one book he wished he didn't have to have seven dimensions he wished he didn't have to have this fellowship with man why can't like Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden I like Brother Willy what he was saying but he never said this part but what a crushing blow he's talking about being crushed what a crushing below to humanity Adam never had to worry about arthritis pre-fall never had to go to the bathroom never had an upset stomach everything you eat was perfect yeah didn't have to worry and build a fence because of bad neighbors praise the Lord anyhow he didn't have to be easy he didn't have to build I shouldn't have said that I'm sorry he but he did I mean why do we build a fence don't fences make good neighbors that's what I heard but he had to build a fence to keep cheetah from coming through his house and eating him it was a crushing blow to Adam because he had control of everything in control of the tree said hey I want that tree over there I'll move it over this way I don't want that mountain over there it's hiding my view move it over this way then all of a sudden one day he looks at the mountain and looks at the tree and goes I can't do a thing about it I can't even save my own wife so you know what I'm gonna go out with her I can't save her but I'm going with her think about that know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God be not deceived neither fornicators idolters adulterers or feminate abuse of himself of mankind thieves covetous drunkards nice people um no revilers nor extortioners shall inherit the kingdom of God and such for some of you and me but you are washed but you are Sanctified but you are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus and by the spirit of our God Lamb's Book of Life Eternal section listen when when when the lamb took the book in Revelations 5 he took one book it didn't have different sections in it it was the book of the redeemed on Earth now there's some people going to be redeemed in heaven everybody with me hello come on foolish version is going to be can't be redeemed here they're going to be redeemed there cup of water my name's gonna be redeemed there those different things like that but you got to be redeemed here that book that he told was because the lamb was slain and you accepted it Hallelujah he puts your name in a book but then he opened it up to show you you were inside of it what a glorious thing we've come to this day and time if you ask John Wesley and I don't know maybe I'm going out on the way I'm here you asked John Wesley do you know your names in the book he said I don't know I can't say it I can't see everything he couldn't listen folks John Wesley was a church age Messenger right Luther was a church-aged messenger but listen they weren't in the back part of God's mind like me and you are all right because God had to wink at the ignorance of him knowing they baptized people wrong they had false Doctrine that's why they had to die to be purged come on God said a prophet to put us in that part of God's mind that was perfect it had no flaw in Doctrine God doesn't matter it doesn't matter about your flaw in your body he wants your soul to be unflawed if that's a word that's why he gave us this that's why he gave us a message I'll read in just a minute a message of reconciliation because he gave us a word of reconciliation how can you have a message without the word listen John Wesley could not stand in his congregation and say what I'm preaching to you is going to change your body as great as he preached sanctification he could not preach us brother John he couldn't preach that group of people to a body change you know how I know that they're all in the grave you are not we have a chance we're given the opportunity to be in this age to give us a chance because he what force off somebody would come to the body change God is my strength and power he maketh my way perfect Philippians 2 15 that you may be blameless and harmless the sons of God without rebuke in the midst of a cooking perverse Nation God didn't put us in a bubble and say live like a Christian Saint John 17 he didn't say Lord take them out of the world put a bubble around them put him on an island Lord with nothing but 1100 sermons now he puts you in the darkest time the darkest hour and some of the worst people to work with in your life I hope nobody from the post office is listening at the moment they did a couple of times have clicked on so I'm not talking about y'all but he did he put us in a wicked and perverse crooked and perverse generation Our Nation among whom you shine as Lots in the world do we shine do we shine in that part that we bump shoulders with the Devil Himself y'all pray for me then come to work with me for a little bit then if y'all just sitting there with you looking at me like that if I don't get any point at this point I want to get across right here Genesis 17 1 now watch when Abram now look watch Abram became who Abraham the father of our faith they're about with me the same guy that when God told him to get up in Genesis 14 12 and 13 14 to get up and leave his job his family and what does he do he gets up and leaves but he takes a lot with him remember when I preached the other day about it's better to obey it's better to obey what God Said than to say I think I'll save my brother that's what Abram was saying come on a lot there's something going on is good I feel it well remember it didn't work out for a lot very well but remember a lot had to write your soul so that's what the Bible says but now watch this scenario just for a minute I know this is kind of getting off but it has a lot to do with the Statue of perfect man but it just came to me last night and when Abram now look Abram was 90 and 9. 9 he was Abram for 99 years a sticker one that laughed at God one that gave his wife away twice uh once when he was Abram and once when he was Abraham hello the Lord Captain Lord that's God Almighty himself Elohim Elohim appeared to Abram and said unto him I am the almighty God walk before me and be thou perfect God had to foreknow Abram was going to be Abraham because in this scripture right here he's not yet what are you saying by the way the even in your darkest time God sees you even your Abram issues he sees in Abraham because Abram became Abraham Hallelujah he became that Abram was part of the name Abraham you even your baby form justification baby form you have a name you're a bride your potential yeah but he said wall before me by black and be perfect even as your Abram comes up right everybody with me now what does that word perfect mean see because everybody and like I said before you try to witness to people and try to try to you know like one of the girls at work hope she's not watching again but she said God's a good God now that's what she said she's a Baptist girl and God doesn't mind if if June wears a dress and she wears pants God's not looking at that she said I didn't say anything no not a word because I'm not going to argue with somebody especially at work okay I have to work with him all the time but I didn't say anything about it but that's their mentality they think Perfection is when I walk through the door that if I have any dust on my shoes or any clods of dirt or some dog it just Falls right off and then when I walk in roses pop up out of the ground and you walk in the door and they're just if it's if it's hot there's a cool breeze just comes right behind you I wish it was that way look in that and you make a mistake I promise you yeah job's accusers will show up all three of them but look this word perfect mean one one who lacks nothing in physical strength or beauty now that's the outside guy sound and wholesome look an ordinary quiet sort of person a complete person morally innocent having integrity one who is morally and ethically pure you say there's no way we can do that well he asked us to be perfect so he asked us to be what complete he asked us to complete our journey and be complete with God not halfway not be halfway reconciled but to be totally reconciled we'll get into that just for a minute because look in Ephesians 4 11 he gave possible prophets pastors teachers Advantage you've read this many times before for what though for the perfecting of the Saints for in other words for the completion of the Saints Journey man they're about with me can I say it that way without uh changing the Bible for the for the perfecting of your life in Christ not your life in the world for the perfecting of the Saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of Christ till we all look till we all come it's a journey till we all come Abram till we all come Abram to Abraham right God's got patience remember have patience with who God because you know what God doesn't dump it all on you at one time he gives you what you need then he gives you what you need then he gives you what you need then he gives you what you need and if you don't need that he ain't going to give it to you come on somebody or you know what if you need something and and you know God knows the end from the beginning he knows if he just gives it right to you you're going to do something wrong with it that not make him infinite remember God's knows are the best yeses you'll ever get could we all come to the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God unto a perfect man because see remember we haven't said this many many times but we did it the first of this this is this is the manifestation of the son of God the Holy Ghost and the Holy Ghost God in spirit form inside of you working toward that perfection everybody with me that's the Son of God dispensation not the son of man because in the Son of God dispensation you can be fooled you can be fooled John Wesley was fooled he'll tell you could he preached false Doctrine he couldn't get the people all the way out brother Brown tells us they couldn't get everybody out even Columbus some of them hung back Luther didn't want to come out and make a Lutheran Doctrine he wanted a Catholic Church to what conform to this new way of this protesting he was protesting what they were doing right right and then he wrote his thesis but he still had flaws you and I still have flaws under the knowledge of the son of God but was the son of man flawed huh and now what we're supposed to be in the son of man dispensation unto a perfect man look knowledge of the Son of God unto a journey unto a perfect man unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ that we hence for me no more children no more children talks to and fro and carried about will never win the doctrine by the slot of man and cutting crafting us whereby they lie and wait to deceive we were talking a few minutes ago about being under the ministry of this church here brother Dale brother Moe you can't discount him and them and everybody's been here that's preached the truth let's come through here brother Mike all taking different ones you see how that they let me just put it this way I went to Piedmont College and I went to Piedmont College we didn't go to Harvard or Yale are Princeton what for us to do that's a different set of people that's a different set of people that's where you get your road Scholars that's where you get your people that are highly intelligent and that's what we are now you and I the bride in this end time were the epitome way past Rhodes scholar way way past all that worth the knowledge of God not the knowledge of man we can speak things what I tell you before we can speak things we can speak things that the world thinks we're crazy and probably half the people in this message think were crazy hello somebody the ministers will absolutely raise their hand and say absolutely that's the truth but I thought we were going to be supposed to be till we come to the unity of the faith and all the Son of God unto a perfect man to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ that didn't say we're all in division but we carried away with everyone in the doctrine brother Smiley this was my point brother smiley he grew up I know most of you knew who brother Coleman was um brother Coleman was under brother was ordained by Brother Branham and brother Coleman was in New York and he had a huge following uh Hayes was the one that that and I say this lightly created the seventhunder doctrine right Dad your daddy knows he's me I think he may have met him one time didn't you yep so now that but the end he was he was of color he was a black man how intelligent had a big church in New York but then he decides to start forwarding his Doctrine cunning craftiness comes down to West Palm Beach to brother West Coast and presents that to him and brother Westco says oh that's the greatest thing I've ever seen so they enter into that uh Doctrine which is totally false and if you want to know what it is then you'll have to ask Daddy or somebody I don't know everything about it but it was like seven men and seven you had to listen to seven different men and it was all kind of mysteries going on it was kind of a almost a cult thing honestly it was it was almost uh they would say phrase words and and it would be that you were talking in secret kind of like a masonic lodge you know kind of like the handshake you know or you'll know he's amazing by what he does in the room well you know he's a Coleman Night by what you know you say or do in the room and that's in the message but he got caught in that Brother Willie got caught in that a lot of the brothers got caught in that every wind of Doctrine when you hear this great thing come out well that's good check it by the word me anybody Bob brother Aaron brother brother brother Louise changing by the word of God do not take it at face value cause I promise you if something inside of you just I mean a little click that says I don't know if that's true or not you better check it out I may be deceiving you don't get quiet on me that's what it says right here every wind of doctrine that wind of Doctrine went from New York it went down to Florida it went out to Arizona it went to California just like the wind of doctrine of this garbage of brother Brown having to come back and put up a tent and you know I say garbage I say because people are sitting around waiting on that to happen and and not studying a message for themselves bunch of lazy people is all I can say with no revelation of what you're doing here what you're doing here I want to see Jesus Christ come back all right not William Bradham I want to see Jesus Christ come back inside of us [Applause] I thought it was Christ in you the hope of glory I thought it was Christ that was being shown to the world but you go to Arizona where all that got started in Tucson and Phoenix and Chris you know he's out there in Flagstaff and he fights it all the time it's just very prevalent because what that wind of Doctrine flew out there then it flew over here and brother Ryan was supposed to get in an airplane when he come back why would you need an airplane with a glorified body I don't want one and they didn't even keep the thing up it's set out there and rusted Hey listen at least Muhammad since the 1200 12th century when he died they've been a horse they believe there's been a horse every so many days they changed that horse and they stand there with a guy for thousands of years they've never missed a day rain wind snow whatever War there's a guy standing there because they know when Muhammad's coming back he's going to need that horse they didn't believe brother Brown needed an airplane either well I'm going I'm going to get out of that by the slide of men and cunning Crafters that's what's here listen Satan's in this message to deceive you he's not in the world trying to deceive you he's in this message trying to deceive you he's already got them sorry if I hurt your feelings but it's true but look speaking the truth in love May grow up into him in all things which is the head even Christ why would Warner we want to sit and wait for something the word perfect it means to complete it's complete furnishing or equipping that's what that is we're equipping we're being equipped as I said before when you took that first cosmonaut and you put him in that first spaceship now that wasn't Orville and Wilbur Wright in that first spaceship Orville and Wilbur were on a a piece of wood with a bicycle of contraption and they flew a couple of hundred feet and crashed but that was the first beginning of your Christian Journey but look at it now they run 14 000 miles an hour now when they put up a rocket ship goes up into the it runs 14 000 miles an hour to get out of the atmosphere it's got to be way it's got to be a lot and you know what they do it now hey Elon Musk he's he put that thing in forward and drive up and he pulled it in reverse and set it back down not him himself but whatever that rocket you know usually Rockets when we we see Rockets they're non-usable I mean they use them one time they fall in the ocean and I guess they become reefs or something I don't know maybe they collect them back I don't know but they're not really usable and then we came out with a lot the Challenger and all the the that program and you could fly up and fly back well now they got that rocket now that they can fly it up turn around and park it straight back down sometimes it don't work sometimes it does but at least they're trying listen man is trying to make themselves perfect themselves by science but the more they make the more they die but not with Christ the more he makes the more you live patience someone that is not swerved from from his deliberate purpose like brother Smiley and I were talking about you take somebody that's they had to have patience because what happened brother Westco uh hurt someone else preach something different than what the Coleman camp was preaching because see they had their own preachers and they they kind of stayed in their own little click so you didn't hear anything from the outside you didn't know anything from the outside but uh a preacher come in and preached and blew that thing out of the water and helped brother West go and them get out of that they had patience Brother Willie they had patience in what they were doing because listen they had set their soul on that seventh under Doctrine that was it when them seven Thunders went off it was seven men if you heard him seven men you was going to take a body change well let me let you in on a secret all seven of those men are dead where's your voice I'll take the voice of the seventh angel because the Bible said he's not going to be silenced he's not going to take us down it's going to take us up so let's have patience man who has not swerved from his deliberate purpose and his loyalty to Faith and piety by even the greatest trials and sufferings patient steadfast brother Brown tells us the Statue of perfect man it says you're beginning to reflect the works of Christ but so many of us try to do the works of Christ before the reflection of Christ is in us you know back to that point about and I hate calling brother Coleman's name but everybody in the whole message know whose it is know who it is or you know where that Doctrine came from but I don't think he was trying to deceive people he was trying to do something amen everybody that has a a an angle is trying to do something they're not literally trying to deceive everybody they're trying to know this new something this new doctrine this new way and you got to come listen to me we'll see you Bear right there when somebody says you got to come listen to me get away but so many of us trying to do the works of Christ before the refraction of Christ is in US I believe the seven thunder sound the Bible said they sounded but it's not seven men I gotta listen to for them to sound we'd be in trouble because they're all gone now brother Brown said now there's the trouble we find those things happening you know it I know it we see stumbles along the road scrap people of what ministers most doctrines do not start in the congregation sad to say they start behind the pulpeper amen we see these stumbles along the road scrap heaps of Ministers of Christians now he's not talking about he's not talking about re you know regenerated unregenerated people he's talking about Christians piled along the road is because they don't go into it right because there was somebody that that brought brother Dale a message one time right maybe even two people I know one for sure not gonna call his name and tried to get him to come into that the brother that went into it right they didn't he said hey wait a minute and he studied it out and when he studied it out he saw that that Minister was in the scrap Heap and you know what he proved he's in the scrap Heap because that's where he ended up in Scrappy right Pop I mean I'm not telling a story about my y'all don't know who it is so piled up along the road not that there not that they're you know horrible people but it's just they went out past God's program you and I don't need to go out past God's program stay in the program that we're in if you're not at patience Pray For What patience that's why this weekend coming up you know let's make this a refreshal not just something it's just not a good idea I came up with okay I've been mulling it over for for a little while and and some had said they'd like to be re-baptizing and I thought when then someone to renew their vows so I just thought we'd do all that together but let's make that as a renewing of of reconcili reconciliation I'm gonna read it before we close I'll get done I'm going to skip through all this I can get to it Sunday how that we he's trying to teach this little church and myself how to take it become the dwelling place of the Living God how many he'd like to be that you know you know what some people are scared to be that some people are scared to be the dwelling place of God because they don't have God inside of them if you've got God inside of you you want to be like God because there's a call coming from inside not from the outside coming from inside patience with what patience with God let me get on through I'll read this and then we'll close I've read this many times he that endures to the end shall be saved we don't know who's going to make it and who's not remember the old saying you look around in heaven and you say what do they talk what are they giggling about he said well guy walked over there and he said well they're giggling because they didn't think he was going to make it and that guy said well I was wondering why that how they made it so don't worry about that worry about ourself that we endure to the end the end is what the end of the end of our like the seventh seals the end of all things it's the end of the struggling world it's the end of all this sin and all this debauchery and all this all this world Cosmos order it will end and what will end um us will be the beginning of the Eternal part sure we live part of it inside of us but I promise you you don't feel very Eternal every once in a while once in the morning and while in the afternoon every day that ends in y and I guess I'm the only one sometimes it feels like you're preaching to yourself without controversy great is the mystery of godliness what is godliness brother around to be like God so let's skip to this a little bit he said be there for perfect you got to have the nature of God we got to have a Doctrine according to Godliness we'll get to that next Sunday but I want to read this down here godliness with contentment is great gain let's keep going then that way we can close and then I'll I'll do this we can do this next don't look at that it'll make you sick let's read a start right here just for a minute it's only 8 24. oh you sons of man how long will you turn my glory into shame Psalms 4 verse 2. how long will you love vanity and seek after leasing Selah but know that the Lord hath set apart him that is Godly for himself remember brother Brown said God was a segregationist we don't we want the whole world to be saved and God does too but he knows who will and who won't you and I don't that's why we keep preaching that's why we keep exhorting we keep we keep trying to pull people pull them in I promise you one thing most of y'all sitting here looking at me today I know when knowledge was Worthy of being saved none of us no I guarantee you I want anybody the rest of you may be but I'm not but know that the Lord has set apart him that is Godly for himself and the Lord will hear when I call unto him so there's a direct link to him standing awe and sin not commune with your own heart upon your bed and be still in other words be patient offer the sacrifice of righteousness and put your trust in the Lord Psalms 32 and here's David I acknowledge my sin unto them my iniquity have I not hid I said I will confess my transgressions unto the Lord and thou forgavest the iniquity of my sin Sheila for this shall everyone that is Godly pray unto thee in a time when thou mayest be found surely in the floods of Great Waters they shall not come nigh unto him Thou Art my Hiding Place Thou shalt preserve me from trouble Thou shalt Compass me about with songs of Deliverance Salah here's the point of one of Maine we'll stop right here second Corinthians 5. therefore If any man be in Christ what he is a new creature all things are passed away behold all things are become new and all things are of God who hath reconciled us to himself what does reconcile mean repair a relationship or to bring back together something that had been pulled apart there's only one man that can reconcile us back to Christ and that was Christ listen Adam tried it he couldn't do it he sinned and all things are of God who hath reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ and hath given to us a Ministry a Reconciliation a Ministry that will bring us back that'll make us number one realize we were lost realize we were separated from God realize at what point we're not in the economy of God but it had a part by foreknowing that you would one day say I've had enough I'm sick and tired of being sick and tired so then if he did that brother John he had to give us a Ministry to get us back he had to give up some Ministry of reconciliation that now we can be reconciled back to back to Christ to it that God was in Christ look reconciling the whole world the whole world but not everybody's going to accept it not imputing their trespasses unto them wow and hath committed us unto the word of reconciliation so there's a Ministry and there's a word to go with it now then we are ambassadors for Christ as though God did beseech You by us we pray you in Christ stead be reconciled to God for he hath made him to be sin for us who knew no sin that we might be made the righteousness of God in him that we might be made the righteousness of God in him and that's that word Godly but we got to read this before we close musicians come everybody stand all that live guardly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution you'll be hated by your own brother sometimes but evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse deceiving and being deceived we'll get to the rest of it we haven't even got down was trying to get to uh blessed is a man that walketh not in the council of the ungodly nor standeth in the way of Sinners nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful but his Delight is in the law of the Lord and in his law doth he meditate day and night and here's your promise and he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water that bringeth forth his fruit in his season his Leaf also shall not wither him whatsoever he doeth shall prosper wow the ungodly are not so there's your separation the ungodly or not so but are like the chaff which the Wind Drive with the way therefore the ungodly shall not stand in the Judgment you say well now hold on a man hold on what judgment is he talking about remember there's part of you that's being judged here everybody's being judged on the earth some have got to go to the white Throne we don't we go for a judgment of the Deeds Done in the body but let's don't read into that that the ungodly will not stand judgment they're going to be judged they're being judged now but they're going to have to give the account when they get there not the center in the congregation of the righteous for the Lord knoweth the way of the righteous but the way of the ungodly Shall Perish let's don't be ungodly but if you live ungodly you may have just a real happy life because the devil's got you but if you live Godly in Christ you're going to suffer because this thing right here is contrary see this is not reconciled yet inside of you is reconciled okay everybody with me this is reconciled in here and we're working on the spirit realm being reconciled but this was born in sin but it will be changed we have a promise that we'll have a body change and we'll live for an eternity as young folks we'll have a you we'll have a youth camp at the last for eternity they won't be no there won't be no coloring and there won't be no being gay and there won't be no praise God it'll be no arthritis medicine they won't be any aspirin ibuprofen all them drugs we take none of that let's get drunk on God let's get
