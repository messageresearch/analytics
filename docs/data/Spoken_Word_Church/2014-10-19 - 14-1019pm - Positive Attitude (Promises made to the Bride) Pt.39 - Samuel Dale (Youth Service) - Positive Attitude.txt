hand I don't know where all of you could see too good sitting down but I reckon brother Gary's been practicing with Luke I thought for a minute there he was going to get in the spirit and start running CU he he's had that to go and he he was he was doing pretty good I said well okay maybe these little ones will put some life in us that we don't you know maybe all did let them put them life in but that's I really enjoyed all of the kids certainly do appreciate all that they do and all of the things and love to to do all we can to help help them in do amen if you'd like turn in your scriptures turn into Galatians 3 and we'll have a couple of scriptures and get into our thought so remember now the festival coming up Saturday uh one till whatever then remember brother fory will be here with us for the weekend then remember brother pic will be here with us on uh this Wednesday the 29th and then brother Ernie vill no will be here us on the 2N of November and remember our Christmas dinner together on the 14th and December and then we'll be having the watch Night Service and brother Boron will be with us preaching the watch Night Service they would remember these as we try to keep the announcements there where anybody watching they will have you know an opportunity to to connect in or whatever because they're always on can view that all right Galatians 3 deely father we thank you Lord for this day and the hour that we have father we thank you for the grace and the love and understanding that you have given into our hearts and our lives Lord we thank you for these children that Lord have put forth their effort to try to worship you and to serve you and to sing about you and to do all the things father we just ask you to help them and guide them and keep them Lord and we pray that you would just Lift Us each one of us us up out of ourselves and as we were trying to say this morning that we would wake up and and to be able to walk in the light of your love we love you and we thank you guide us now and keep us in Jesus name amen Galatians 3 we'll start verse 13 through 16 and then we'll go to 28 and 29 all right Christ has redeemed us from the curse of the law being made a curse now remember what curse is everyone that hangs on the tree right where it is written cursed is everyone that hangeth on a tree that the blessings of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Jesus Christ and that we might receive the promise of the spirit through faith Brethren I speak after the manner of men though it be but a man's Covenant but yet if it be confirmed no man disol or adth there unto now to Abraham and his seed were the promises made now what promises made not just one we'll get to it in a little bit it's not just eternal life it's promises all right made he saith not unto seeds as of many but as of one and to thy seed which is Christ all right drop over now to verse 28 he says there is neither Jew nor Gentile there's neither Bond or free there is neither male male nor female for you are all one in Christ Jesus and if you be Christ plural now watch then are you Abraham's seed and HS according to the promise you may be seated the Lord had his Blessing to the reading of the word now I want you to think about something this afternoon because that's what we're going to talk about we're going to talk about the promises made to the bride am we need some more beds for people to sleep in Saturday night okay we need some people who have beds that nobody is in that bed uh you know because we don't need just beds with people in them we need somebody to be able to supply a bed to be a able to take up the slack on the you know people that are here and we got to know about it now because you know people will be coming and not even H not having to go back home we need to be able to put them up here and doing that okay so if you will make sure you let us know all right now to me let me see if I can remember the statement first close I had rather have a promise from God than all in the world that you could do to try to you know give me something or whatever this is or whatever that is I would still cherish a promise from God more than anything real that could be given unto me because I know that he will keep his promises and to me now the entire book that's why I read it like I did and emphasized on it it says promises not just eternal life there's a lot of promises in God's word amen and that way if if we can believe they for us now here's the point that first we've got to believe they're for us right you know I mean there's there's a a lot of uh promises out there in the world you can hear them all the time you know on the on the things that call in this number and we've got a whole bunch of this that's and the others and we've lost contact with people Etc and we're trying to find them you know well you know well that's promises but the thing of it is we got to believe that promise is for us now to believe it's for somebody else that's wonderful that's all right but we must believe it's for us okay and see then that will if we believe it's for us then will have the uh more Assurance of seeking after that to where that it can be ours all right what were we talking about this morning that awake thou that sleepest you know see there's a lot of people out there that's still asleep because they don't know the promises they don't know it's for them and and I'm sorry to say that in the time and and parts that I've been around the message and watching the people the people of this message are the very lowest about remembering the promises right you know they talk about something that will be hopefully someday you know yeah we we believe that yeah yeah we believe that uh you know we believe one of these days there's going to be a bride you know well why can't we believe that it's now I mean we we say well we believe it's going to be it's going to do that's we're going to have this or that now here is my whole point what have we been on positive attitude if you won't confess the promises that God has made for you how can he fulfill them right amen that's right now remember he can't save you remember the other week unless you want to be saved he can't heal you unless you want to be healed all right see then we got to remember the promises and he said what his promises were yay and amen all right now so what I'm wanting us to think about a positive attitude and think about the promises are for us amen now I I think that God would not be uh what would you call it offended with us if we put it on the basis of believing it for ourselves you know that's mine right you know all right because remember what has been our point of of of positive attitude those who believe that they are called for that job they are that that's for them see Martin Luther had to believe that God called him and then God could come on the scene amen well right now that's the point I want us to think about the promises of God throughout the word and you know who therefore far how much would be greater now uh anyone who believes God can receive benefits right right just anybody if they really believe but what about the children of God and that's where Paul emphatic is stating it see and brother BR said he he was putting it to where that he was putting himself in there into that one seed which is Christ and he wanted us to know that he believed that he was a part of that right all right and see that's what we were to do it's not Jew it's not Gentile we read that all right but it's the Christ the promise all right see he promised this rde in the end time many marvelous things right amen you know well why can't we believe that we're them right amen but remember the point if we won't say it's for us or if we won't say what God says we are how can he make it manifest that's right you you remember what we've been on now death is what death is unbelief he that believeth not is condemned already all right see if we won't confess it we're dead we have no hopes well why can't we start confessing it well I brother know like people say you know I was listening last night to a tape where brother Bram was talking about that lady saying that she was healed and you remember her own husband and said and both of them Christians he said he said her husband said but honey you know I mean it's all right but said you know you're out here saying you're healed when you're not well you see that's oh that's really honesty isn't it now I I I don't want to say something that's not true and the you know I know the Bible says I'm Healed but my name is not written there so that might not be me you know well why not it's my Bible why can't I believe he's talking about me all right that's the only thing that I'm talking about not trying to work up something because I learned a long time ago you can't work up anything in this message you know it might Li for a little while you might get some emotionals going for a little while but it won't be long little die right but you know what if a spontaneous combustion comes Among Us why can't we all believe that it's for us and all of us think about that I I thought we were to be as the prophet said that it says he was wounded for Samuel Dale I thought we believe believe we were supposed to put our name right in that place and confess it that way oh yeah we can say oh yeah he would he he he was he was that for so and so yeah we believe that but I don't want to lie now and I just don't feel no better well don't worry about it you're going to die with what you got well you just just you just ain't much of a nice guy no but is it true I mean you know you're going to die what you got if you w confess to get rid of it all right but then the positive attitude is not to just say okay I'm going to I'm going to confess I'm I'm Healed okay wonderful your part word you remember what I was saying this morning where the Prophet said it's not what you pray come on that really sunk in to me he said it's not what you pray it's not the words you use see we think we're using great words to uh you know bring God on the scene or to do something and that's not it he said it's your faith your Revelation your faith in what you're doing all right now your faith can only be related to you amen your faith is not my faith just because you got saved didn't make me saved right this is not something to where they just lumped on all of us and what starts a Revival always the record of a Revival started was started from one person or something maybe one or two get together or something would start a Revival that would turn the world upside down but you know what they believed it and when are we going to start believing that we're the people of God Amen well brother D I believe that but I just have problems because look at look at how sickly we are I'll get to that Wednesday I don't want to spend so much time on it because I want you to think there's no negativism in Hebrews 13:8 that's right so our little pity patter things that we bring in are no good our little it's not for me right is exactly right it's not for you you're confessing it I wish we would confess the word as much as we confess the realities of life you know how you feel well I'm down and out I'm having problem I've got this and I got that well you know what you just keep this and that cuz it lead least if you said I am healed you are saying what God Said and he can come on the scene but he can't come on the scene when it's just a bunch of negativism and you know I got to get off that all right but think about it a positive attitude and think about the promises that God has made for you and I there's really you know there's nothing in the book that's not a promise for you and I all we had heard all things right all right but when are we going to start saying it and doing it but you know I mean I'm honest and we do it we're human beings we hurt we're sick there's no such thing as as uh positive thinking to a point of saying well I'll just say I'm not sick and I won't be sick no that's lying it there's where you're lying at it's not lying to say that you're healed because God says you're healed right all right but he I want that point in in our minds he cannot heal us if we won't confess we're healed right he can't save us if we won't confess where're he saved amen but see our point is we confess it as long as everything's working good right it's real easy to say you're a millionaire if you got it in the hand right but when you got a dime in your pocket it's hard to say You're A Millionaire right right but you know what you got a million dollars you started with the dime right you started somewhere with that some point well why not start with a positive attitude about life and doing you know that I've always preached that now this is not something new it's just the form of trying to get it lined up in the word I've always told you you call me up how you doing wonderful it's hard to go to the doctor how you doing I'm doing wonderful well what are you doing here well okay doc my leg's hurting how about helping out you know because that way you know but they just don't understand you and then turned around the doctor said well look you got this and look got that and you say well thank you doctor but by Stripes I'm Healed right back in his face you might find out a lot of them believe they might want to believe with you you know I mean I said that to one when had that GL taken off you know and he came in there he said Sam he said can I pray for you before I operate on you I said I sure wish you would am you know I I sure wish you would well you know what I mean he prayed for me right there amen well all right I I don't want nobody don't believe the way I believe if I had that attitude I wouldn't want nobody to believe the way I believed either amen did that didn't get across you know I wouldn't want nobody to believe the way I believe if I don't believe but see I'm trying to believe all things the prophet speaks of believing for the impossible well here's faith when I see it I'll believe it and I'll say it well you'll never say it right it'll never come to pass that way right why because God wants somebody to say it am why does it say speak to this mountain come on why does it say that cuz somebody's got to speak to the mountain well see why can't we start saying it and no matter how sick or we get is that the way way the prophet describes sickness a lot of times that when you're prayed for and you get sicker it's the greatest sign but you know that's hard to do I agree with you it's hard to do you know all right but think about it now the promises made to this seed that we believe that we're part of and that means the entire Bible now I'll just scan through and won't have to pull these up but just to give you a thought listen to what he says he's talking about the promises he made in the Bible he said now if what if the promises he made in the Bible is not true then it's not the Bible or there is no God you can read it right there now if we think the promises are not true see then there is no Bible and there is no God but if the bible promises are true and God confirms them promises then he's the god of the Bible which is the word all right but but yet if we say it's for somebody else but not for me now you've taken yourself out of the word true you re you withdrew yourself from being part of the word all right now God doesn't need another boat so don't get all tied up in your theology God don't need another Ark right that's done been done right but he needs something else you know what he needs in the end time he needs a group of people that every day they're getting sicker and dying and going towards the grave but yet they can stand up and face death and say death where your sting grave where your Victory sir and I don't mean just say that CA somebody else said it amen say it because it's for you and I all right every promise in the book is mine every chapter every verse every line that's right I'm trusting in his love divine for every promise in the book is mine look what he says I'm an air to all things through Christ come on I'm an air to my healing yes I'm an heir to my joy I'm an heir of Salvation purchased of God born of his Spirit worst in the blood everything that God promised is mine joint HS with the Lord Jesus now if anybody had a good case of circumstances but R always uses job but let me use the Lord Jesus where would it be that you could look at him and see and think about him as being God let me take the negative side of it if nothing else with it if you were back there if we were there and he was walking around what would you base the point of being that he was God h you say well the sick could be healed the anointing could work right but you understand what I mean whose side would we be on if we were back there just remember then whatever side you would have been on back there is the side you're on now all right but what about being joint hours well I just don't see how that could be see now you're in unbelief somebody planted that seed of death with inside of us that would deny God's word and yet maybe a lot of them was done with good intentions and good thoughts and might have been even telling the truth but that's what's killing us is what we've been taught right right well the doctor says that so and so well amen for the doctor we thank God for good doctors good doctors we thank God for good preachers good preachers we thank God for good people good people right right but there's a lot out there that's not good and that goes into the negativism that is destroying us but look he goes on to say in the unchangeable god working in unchangeable unexpectable ways no matter what the promise is it's yours anyhow you see you and I are going to have to and and we'll say this is right somebody somewhere someday will have to look death in the face and call it defeated right now that's in our mind somebody someday will do you go talk to people and they're telling you you know how I illustrate it you talk to people yes we believe we're in the end time yes we do Welly look at all these things taking place we if you kind of get along with that you're okay but you just start telling them yeah that's right it could be any day now now because it's all of these things piling up could be and you watch them well now I don't know about that I believe maybe 50 years from now all right I'm 74 I don't need 50 25 is enough for me you know my point right I'm trying to put it off on the somebody else instead of taking it and standing right there and it admitting that I'm an unbeliever right oh no I I'm a Believer but what do we believe what is our believing what about it what about the promises God has made you and I you'll realize in the whole Bible is tied together y That's in a beautiful picture speaking of climaxing finishing ending whatever in a group of people that can take God's word right am now you remember we've Illustrated this a lot David wasn't afraid of Goliath that's right right why you remember how we bring it out why was it David wasn't afraid of goli why because he's been anointed to be king right he wasn't afraid of him and all of his brothers and his cousins and uncles or whatever he' took the whole Army himself cuz he'd been anointed to be king all right we are the bride of Christ we have been given a new birth which totally redeems the soul all right but we've been made a promise of a bodily change that is the day that we're to live why should we worry about death then amen why would we be concerned about dying you mean it bothers you about dying now come on we're human beings we're honest we're straight we're not going to get in front of the train and hurry it up no but are you afraid of dying fear had torment that's why you're dying cuz you're afraid right at least let me just stand there and say come on Satan you can take this body but maybe I said enough to where somebody can understand a little bit about what they're supposed to be that would be my desire my thoughts would to be able to plan in you if I pass on as to know brother Quinn wrote in the notes I noticed it a little email to us that the things that happened so many people saved and and all and he said brother Dale and the money y'all gave us that a part of that went to that trip and things and he said you know what that'll be counted to Y all yes well that was good right amen you know that was good all right so we have a part to do with it am now God don't need us but he honors that of what we do for him right amen but see he promised us we go through a lot we talk about the cankerworm pal worm Locust caterpillar that's a promise in God's word amen that somebody's going to come to that place we talk about the faith of the fathers it means somebody's going to come to that place we talk about the people in the end time being the fullness of the godhead bodily what about a group of people now when we first came into message did you think very much about that 20 years 30 years 40 years ago no because we didn't know it even existed take brother Brandon's message and listen to the promises that he talks about amen the whole message right everything and it's all pointing to you and I that's right promising a power that will come in his church that he can say all God was he poured into Christ or into Jesus and all Jesus he pours into the church God wanting his work done he sent his son the son wanting his work done sending him the church at that day you'll know that I am in the father you and me and I and you at that day but why should we be so what's the word down and out as until we have no joy you know I mean I watch some of you and I see you just and I don't mean just sitting but you just you're like death is waiting on you and you're slowly getting there forgive me for the illustration but that's about as good as I can come up with truth is truth we're getting older but you know what I thought we believed every day we live we was closer to being young that was what I thought you know have I missed it oh I'd love to be changed back about 30 years what good would it do you 40 years give you 50 what good would it do you Abraham and Sarah was turned back to young man and young woman right right right but you know what that didn't even give him a baby come on am just because it made young didn't even give him a baby righten it took a change to come on him cuz he couldn't have a baby to start with why can't you and I look at things and be happy about it in the bases of thank you Lord of what has been made known you know of what has been made known to you and I want to be the happiest people there would not be no frowns on nobody's face everybody ought to be smiling happy well you just don't feel like I do well go ahead and keep your sickness is see everybody sympathetic with sickness I'm not sympathetic with sickness I'm sorry I'm sympathetic with people who have sicknesses yeah but not sympathetic with sickness not our self-made sicknesses my wife fusses at me all the time because I won't tell her that I'm hurt and I said what good does it do does it help me does it help you come on didn't let me struggle let me go along I gu thinking about not feeling too good and and I'll be watching Danny he'll be up here for him to get down and do a foot washing is a major piece of Masterpiece I guess he's developed over how to do it well but you know what he don't stop and not do it am he'd be justified in not doing it wouldn't he but he'll go do it amen well why can't that be an example amen absolutely amen as I've always told you about sister Trudy mcmillon there for 20 something years drove four hours of a morning coming here in 4 hours evening going home but yet we're within holling distance almost and can't make it why don't you look around sometime at the people sitting around you that's right and quit pity pattern or parties in your own doings of how bad you feel and look at somebody else and see how bad they feel yeah but brother Dale you just don't understand I know it I agree with you no problems I don't understand what could God do any greater than what he's done right right yes sir come on somebody raise your hand tell me something God could do oh he could fill my pocket yeah that's about the way you think he's given us eternal life amen in our soul amen giving us the message of the hour and how many of you read the books and listen to the text but yet we're ready for Rapture oh yeah we're not inter Rapture no we're confessing with our mouth something that our being is not making manifest you know well there's a revival going on but I just don't see it so I guess it's not really going on but you know maybe they're having it what did the prophet say about even healings and that he said one person healed in a building it ought to throw everybody in desperation in that building but you know we also ought to remember that he said one wrong attitude in the building can cause others to not be healed and you don't quote the rest of that he said and that will be dealt with one day right that's something paraphrasing it but you know in other words you're going to give an account well Heaven helped me not to stand in somebody's way right but wouldn't it be something you come up here to me to be pray brother want you pray I'll pray for you but I just don't believe God healed like he used to right yeah right like I heard a man say one time talking to another two preachers one of them said to the other one he said you ain't got nothing and I ain't got nothing well they already sh up sat down resign for preaching because that negative attitude don't fit in God's word nowhere but of course he went right on preaching so did the other brother you but you see if we don't confess we're healed we can't be healed if we don't confess we're saved we can't be saved if we don't confess we can be changed it's not going to happen that's right amen that's right so at least let me say it it may be a hundred years from now but at least let me confess it here right because if I can stand here and say it someday it can take place right right amen at least let me give hope to the people yes I listen to and I've been around this message quite a while and you know that would you hear some of them preachers preaching well I think well my Lord I had a better understanding that in the Baptist Church yeah and I did right that's right that's the problem I did but yet we're just down and out you know I was discussing with some brothers one time like this and they were saying that well we need more signs and wonders I always agree with that you know we need more healing in Lula Amen Let Me amen it but now for me to say we don't have any in Lula I'm a liar right I'm an unbeliever now we're in a different category right at least let me give you a hope Amen in the way that I preach to word that you can attain unto it whether I make it or not let me try to help youen amen instead of hinder you you realize where the negativism you said hard to get off I want to preach on that I I I'll still preach it Wednesday it don't matter but see if you say that he's not the he same today in healing as he was in Jesus's ministry as he was in brother uh Paul's Ministry as he was in brother Brown's Ministry and you say he's not the same I want to tell you publicly and flatly and bluntly you're a liar amen and let me defend it with the gospel Hebrews 13:8 right amen Hebrews 138 says he's the same yesterday today but not tomorrow or yesterday he was ding brother around his ministry and the people but he's not here today now you know how I preach that and I make it straight and blunt there's none of us with that Ministry that he had no no way that's right I humanly personally and flatly bluntly tell you I don't I wouldn't want it cuz you don't know what went with that I know what goes with the little bit I got but you realize that same Ministry is still got to be here or Hebrews 138 as a liar well where's it at let's go look for it that's what they done when brother Brandon ped on when brother Brandon ped on I used to know the name of the man that they went out to there was this man had some signs and wonders and some gifts and you know what the big name people run out there to listen to him and brother Brown said there's not another one to come right amen if I told you who that they said went you would drop your lips and say oh no brother Dale well but you know what they were human they were looking for something that's right amen but that won't work but I believe the ministry of brother brandom is the ministry of Jesus Christ and I believe that Ministry of around the world in a many membered body how would you say it divided up as parts to you and I that we have just a little bit the other people have a little bit the other but it's all still here or either you're a liar right and Hebrews 13:8 is calling you one you realize how easy that un unbelief has slipped in oh if we were just back there had two brothers since I've been in this message that told me he said I was in brother Brown's Ministry and said I saw the signs and wonders I said brother Dale I believe the same God is in you you pray for me you know what God healed him sir was it me no it was their confidence their faith in what it was it didn't matter what I was what I was didn't have anything to do with it it's what they thought one day you'll see that he says there will come a power into the church and now is coming this is 1960 hear your himym that the Holy Spirit Will so anoint the people that they'll speak the word and it'll create itself right there we haven't seen Powers lights coming into the church now I know it for a fact say unto this mountain and it'll be removed amen that's your profit well I know it was in him yep it was in him now I don't believe it's nowh else we see you're trying to find it as I've said you're trying to find one other person that things are happening in instead of looking around the world and say in he is Hebrews 13:8 if he ever done one thing he can't take it back it's here amen but when are we going to believe it God has revealed God was revealed in Christ Jehovah revealed in Christ now where is God to be revealed in his church with his people in us the The Same Spirit the same works the same manifestation the same love the same forgiveness the same longsuffering gentleness patience peace Mercy all that was in Christ is in his church keep this in mind all that God was he poured into Christ he was the fullness of the godhead bodily and all of that Christ was he poured into the church God above us God With Us God in us oh go now here we go all right here we go but brother Dale I don't see the love I just I don't see the love well you know what I preached sister Margaret's funeral and my statement was was to be a friend you must be friendly she was a very friendly person once you realized her and talked with her but you see you got to be a friend to have friends it don't mean you friends bring you you now you got to be a friend and you tell me you don't see no love I don't see no love in Lula well why don't you start a Revival right why don't you just fall in love with everybody in Lula why don't you manifest that we went to a church one time Wade warned me before we got there he said Daddy Please don't hug them men and say I love you the brother probably hear it if he hears the tapes said don't do it they think you a little you know different different I when I turn priest I come outside the first guy I came to I grabbed him I huged his neck jerked him up I said I love you brother about the second trip Wade went in between and kind of letting them know but about the second trip when I walked out I stick out hand just come right on you know well you know what it killed that Spirit right you know what they probably would have known they had that Spirit if You' have told them well why can't you create an atmosphere you know and brother randam how did he explain it he said no my wife was all upset the kids was all upset everything going wrong he said I got me an apron and said I put the apron on said come on honey I I'll help you do the dishes and he started doing the dishes and he said honey said I down a store the other day and said I saw this prettiest dress and said you look good in that dress now come on what was I saying this morning he didn't say he prayed for nobody he didn't say he prayed for the kids and they quit he said in a few minutes he said everything solved in the kitchen and he said in a few minutes the kids was playing amen all because he got an apron and helped his wife right one of them people is ain't friendly we went to a church one time and brother Gary and Margaret and Peggy and little Beck was our thanks here and I came out you heard me tell it and I came out and they were standing over to one side and all the people were out here and I said y'all over here by yourself yep said ain't nobody in the church shook her hand welcomed us I said I'll tell you another one I preached the message and only one shook my hand and it wouldn't even the pastor that done that right Peggy came here and she made herself blunt my wife the people that on tape we call her nanny she made herself blunt she said when the company comes in that door somebody meet them somebody go outside shake their hand and tell them welcome well you know what it's developed pretty good to let everybody they still you know sometimes but just change the whole atmosphere what's wrong with it what's wrong with being happy you know there's not a Day Pisces that I don't thank God for all that he's given me physically financially and spiritually first amen I tell him every day Lord I love you thank you you didn't go to school wearing your brother's four time three times hand down because it was three above me and britches that my patches had patches on the patches and I'm not joking most of you wouldn't even remember it you remember the iron on patches some of you older ones they put put them on there and iron them on well you know they didn't put them inside they just ironed them on the outside and everybody knows you had AR on patches course everybody knows you had your brother's britches on because they'd seen him with them patches right you wasn't raised most of your kids you can't even talk to you about anything you think you're trying to be something no I thank God that I come through that I thank God that I plow a you when I was 7 years old out in a field we go down to where we're going hunting there's a cotton field out there I tell them I said my backs are killing me hurry up and get by that place why cuz I crawled on the ground picked that cotton look what God's done for you and I just financially ain't a one in here that does doesn't have enough money to go get them something to eat on the way home if you don't let me know at it I'll be glad to give it to you but you can do it you can take people out to eat that's why my wife gets on to me all the time she said you you just buy food for everybody I told her I've told you I just as soon buy a millionaire a plate a dinner plate as a poper you say I don't understand that I'm not meaning the difference of what I wouldn't do I'd be glad to give the other person I just mean that I was at a time I couldn't afford hardly to eat and I just want to be something to somebody to help them you know do something for them why because well I don't see no love brother Dale what what you mean is you don't see the kinds you want or the kinds you got you ever whipped your kids and told them that you whipped them because you love them you explain that to the kid it wouldn't explain to me when I was a kid and it won't be explained to your kids right and do you really mean that you know that brother randam told us something one time that I think is amazing point you know I always tried to do it he said don't whip them kids until you first talk to them well I come up a minute of time my kids are tell say Daddy just whip me just just whip me get it over with we don't want you talking and I'm not talking about how bad and dirty they are right well we don't see that we don't see no longsuffering patience peace well are you saying it's not here because you don't see it I don't have no problem I'll put this church against any church in the message as far as the doings and the helps and the wonderful that you know the uh doings of trying to be nice and I I have no problem but listen do we give him the honor and the glory for the promises he made that he's keeping for you and I you know that he promised in the end time that the Bride of Jesus Christ would be the fullness of the godhead bodily how many times I need to read all of that he said and no leav among you brings that fullness amen he promised a seed to come down and finish in the excuse me in the form of the Grain in the end time the original grain that went into the ground he promised the dead to be raised the sick to be healed at a word I listening we were the other day to a tape and you know what brother Brown said he said you want to see angels in your home you know what he said he said make them welcome I'm paraphrasing it but that's his words make them welcome he said the reason you don't see angels in your home that there's too much there that the Angels don't like well you know what see I tell it in people that get all offended to do I've seen an angel three times but you know what I didn't come out of that saying bless God I've seen an angel three times I guess I I had it in good shape you know what the thought was I used to have it in good shape maybe the reason I ain't seeing them now is because of the shape I'm in I never come out of it as a great thing of looking what I've done or what I've been I said Lord I'm sorry I'm sorry that you couldn't come in my home like you've come in my home before you see I'm not trying to live no goody two shoes in front of you to let you think I'm this Dad or the other I try to tell it like it is maybe the reason we're not in the presence of God a lot of times it's because we've run the presence of God off that's right amen did the prophet say thr out them vulgar magazines throw out this and throw out that we turned around and put them in computers don't call them TVs we don't even call them what is that other words in the middle monitors we don't even call them monitors we call them computers same old thing I'm honest what about you but the promises and you know what and let me end it with this thought you know he made the promises and you know what we can't be dirty enough to keep him from keeping his word I know you don't want to think like that he still comes in our homes he still comes in and heals us he still comes and delivers us right because he promised it that's right I like brother Mo he had a way of saying it said you can't not paraphrase he said you can't be good enough to be saved but you can't be bad enough that God can't save you that's a paraphrase from what he used to say at somewh like that you know God's going to keep his word but you know what we may get a lot of weapons to line us up to what he wants us to do but you don't want anytime sickness to come what did I do Lord Brother R said pray ask God to forgive you cleanse you up get started right he said the sickness don't go away he said God's got it there for a reason right right it don't mean you don't pray for it no more to be gone he's got it there for a reason let him work out his doings right I told a car fractor the other day I went Friday and I said maybe the Lord trying to tell me I need to sit down I said cuz I can sit down I don't hurt he just laughed at me cuz he knew I wasn't going to sit down I said you just straighten up my back cuz I'm heading out hunting I don't want my back hurting you can help me help me but you see church God made a lot of promises you know what he's going to keep them am you know the difference is is whether or not we can believe it's for us we'll determine whether or not it is for us right promises all the promise promises in the book of mine with the last promise you remember how we were bring it in the ages and obious see all this ties together bring it in the ages of the last is to inert all things because it keeps coming down but then when we get it then it'll go all the way back to the original in the beginning and it'll all tie together right did I hope you followed that amen we're going to receive greater things than is been made manifest upon Earth yes cuz we're going to go through a change of the body but you know what we're not the only ones going to go through that's why I love it the Bible doesn't say that the last day group is the only one to be changed it says the dead in Christ shall rise first and we which are alive and remain because we shall all be changed right and you're not going to look down Luther and you you just you go sit down over there in the corner we are the great people no just don't worry about it you're not going to be there forget that went to a meeting one time in a church and this brother he said man come over he wasn't a pastor he was another I guess a deacon or something he said brother Dale we want you to sit right here I said no way I'm going back here the pastor come in he said brother Dale we want you to come up here I said no way I'm satisfied where I'm at cuz the Bible says to take the back seat right he said yeah but the Bible says the one that's giving you the orders that tells you to come to the front row I said okay I'll be there in a second see that's scripture when they ask you go don't go in well look at me I'm going I going set on front row cuz I'm topnotch now go to the back sit down then when the people that are there call you to the front they're the one that's honoring your ministry see that way you're not exalted you're happy about it promises made to the bride promise her to be the fullness of the godhead bodily promis her to raise the dead promis that she would do it that he would come among her and raise the dead and we go into Rapture promise the change of these bodies now let's take the last he promised that we'd be there with our offspring that stops most people you know what it stops them cuz they've never seen it made manifest right but I have well why can't I say I have are you saying that you're so you know and that's what one brother one time told he said you mean your kids are going to be saved they because they're your kids I said no way go be my kid that means they're lost but I said if I can believe all things are possible to them that believe the Bible says you'll be there with your Offspring has he ever spoke to you about that scripture he spoke to me about it and our way was he was out in the world I just I was it to me I never worried No More we have some grandkids great grandkids coming along you know I spoken for them well it doesn't look like they're coming that's your eyeballs you're not looking through mine so forget it well they going to be saved at the white thr judgment I don't accept that that's a secondary right that's an excuse for me not believing they can be there that's a secondary point that could happen I want them here with the eternal life that I have amen yes can you believe it amen sir did brother brandham talk to brother Dalton is that the one that stood right here and told it even the Jim Ed the ever which way you pronounce it the the old gentleman that brother ROM told all the his kids would be saved stood right here in his P pit and told us about it you know what they were abely but see here's where we want to go brother Brandon spoke to sister had R about her two kids and said I give you those two kids he said they fell down right there and received Jesus Christ you know what they told later that they'd went back in the world and back flipped well it just wasn't all together right start with now where did you get that idea well they back FID how many times have you solve the problem right how many times have you backslid w you lost every time you backslid we don't believe in being born again and then backsliding that's the Pentecostal idea cuz if you was born again and backslide it mean you go back to somewhere else and you can't lose the baptism of the Holy Ghost sister had his rights two kids and brother run spoke that that was it that's right they'll be there oh what a road they got to go because it was said but can we believe that I tell June I said every time I look at weight of life but you know what they come a day I had to look at her in life cuz you see maybe you don't let let's see if you can follow this see you say well that's just your children that's Wade Terren and Anna well now Wade and June are the same Terren and Lisa is the same man and Richards A Sign so whatever goes with one goes with the other one amen right that's my children right and you know I don't have a bit of trouble with my my my mom used to call them the Outlaws you know ones that are not truly your children by natural birth she called them the in-laws and the kids Outlaws cuz they were the trouble you know what why can't we claim our children I've told you a key and I reminded my wife of it I don't sell a gift no way you can't explain it but I said when you're sitting there listening and somebody's preaching and God really reveals something to you opens your eyes about something that you see that you've never seen before I said raise your hands and say my family one day you'll know what that means because you're P the lip service you're into a realm of faith that is living within you am you'll understand that let's Stand Together got come on Brothers think on these things we have these other brothers coming in for the next few services so maybe they can help to understand cuz I just want you to see one thing the promises in God's book is mine he talks he's talking to me I don't read the Bible that he's talking to somebody else have you ever noticed what it really says in Malachi 4 and you know that when sister mey is that the one the LI you know that God told her when he was she was talking about whether to marry bill or not she said I send you Elijah the prophet right well you know she just took that and went home and married him you know but you know it don't say you I'll send to everybody it says I send you now write your name Elijah the prophet was sent for me can you say that everybody's got to say it cuz that's that one
