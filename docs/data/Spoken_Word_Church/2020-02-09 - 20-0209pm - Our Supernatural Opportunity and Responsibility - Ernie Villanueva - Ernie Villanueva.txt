we always call you visitors when you come one time then tone you just part of us so just welcome and all I guess you can be seated for a minute but we got a little testimony that he's promised me the other day that he'd give it today so I guess that's why we got one this one service all right well good afternoon I guess I'll go ahead and start off by saying that uh when I was about 18 I I started going to ung University of North Georgia College and I kind of went with a an open mindset because I wasn't really born again I didn't have something to keep me grounded in the Word of God of course I've been going to youth camps all my life and stuff like that so I've had experiences with God and I've seen him in the services and I felt his presence but I never really had something within me to you know ground and keep me and God so when I started going to college after being homeschooled all my life and you know not really being exposed much of the world that those influences being around the long run people kind of took me out and I started getting involved in things that I should have gotten involved in and you just open yourself up to those spirits and they take hold of you know and so I was oh it wasn't a good place in my life and I kind of fell down into this deep hole that I couldn't get out of on my own and one thing I learned very quickly is once you once you start dabbling in sin sin will always take you farther than you want to go or to go so I learned that very quickly and I tried to bring myself out of that place many times on my own but I couldn't yeah I just you you can't do it on your own it's it's physically impossible I need God to bring you out of that and it took me a while to realize that it took me about one and a half to two years to realize that and um God was dealing with me throughout that entire time but um I just couldn't fully give myself over I couldn't fully surrender and I yeah I just I kind of got stuck in this loop of just just going around and sin over and over like I would be like God just just take this away from me take take these things these desires for the world that I have but I just couldn't fully give myself over I saw I'd be like okay well I have this thing that I can give up but then I have to give up this other thing and I don't quite want to let go of yet and um so it was just as a really bad place to being and it was depressing and and really hard um but then I I started getting really desperate because I started realizing well how is this gonna help me in life as this taking me you know to to a good place a place that's gonna help me in the future is it gonna make me um it's not making me a good son it's not gonna make me a good husband in the future it's not gonna make me a good father so I really started realizing the effect that it was having home and so I really got desperate and started asking God for more of a desperation to read his word and to get closer to him and I just kept praying for that over and over and I just asked him to take the desire for the things of the world and everything that I was dealing with and one day I just I realized that there was this this desire to read the Word of God more and actually get in his word because before that I I didn't even want to read the Bible like I didn't really have the desire at all I didn't think there was a need for it in my life I didn't I thought I even got to the point where I was I was kind of getting or I was thinking to myself that maybe it was too late for me and maybe uh you know God I just gone too far I had let go um I had maybe just that wasn't trying hard enough time to let go of the things of the world but you gotta have God take that from you you gotta have God yeah he's he's the only answer and he's the only thing that can completely transform your life so it just took me a while to realize that on my own so I started reading the Bible I'm just just feeding myself full of the word as much as I could and as much as you know I I just kind of I would read my Bible that night and just whenever I thought about it you know I pick up my Bible and read it in just and just I the more that I did that I realized the desire for a new group and I just kept feeding myself and stuffing myself fool the worried and so I talked to my dad about what I was going through and he knew you know my parents knew that I was going through a time in my life where I needed prayer and I knew that they were praying for me and I think that has a lot to do with coming to the Lord a lot so my dad told me to keep reading the Bible and that God is obligated to keep his word and he said that to me one time long I think was January night of January 6th yeah he came in my room and he told me that that God is obligated to keep his word and when you get born again it's like God stepping out in front of him and saying you're right now for the first time in my life that really like hit me all of a sudden and I realized wow I want that so bad and I just felt like this desire it's so strong to just completely let go of everything and surrender myself fully so um I started crying after he said that and yeah I just said I want that so bad and I just I prayed and I read my Bible that night and I went to sleep and I you know I felt pretty good but I didn't feel like I had what I needed yeah I didn't feel like I had that born again born again experience that I was searching for so um the next day the night of January 7th I'll never forget that day I was reading my Bible and I was I was by myself I was just you know spending time with God and I was reading acts 2 I got to verse 21 and it said initial come to pass that whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be saved and that's when I hit me and that's when I knew that I knew that I knew I felt this this this well I started praying right after that and I was like God you said it in your word that whosoever and that's me calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved and so I just kept praying over and over God fill me with the new birth just give it to me so that I don't have to go in this loop again so that I can be settled and rooted in the word for the rest of my life because you know I don't want to have to go through that again and I just I want to serve you the rest of my life and I laid it all before him completely and I felt this I know you don't have to have a feeling or anything like that but I felt this feeling come over me it wasn't like a strong presence or anything it was a warm feeling of the presence of God and I was just repeating over and over God filming with the new birth filled me with the new birth and this thought was inserted into my mind and I know it was on my own it wasn't an audible voice or anything it was just a thought and it said you only had to ask me one time [Applause] so that was it that settled it and ever since then I've been able to see God directing my life and everything that I desired before completely out of my life I felt like my personalities changed my entire nature the person I was before is just gone I'm dead on the ground and that's an amazing feeling so I'm proud to say that I'm I'm a Christian and I'm bleeding on the ward to go out today Thank You mr. Moni let's stand together everybody knows brother Ernie he doesn't out to be introduced thank you for coming down we thought was gonna be missing all the services our heart but it turned around and we got here this evening so that's why it's all the doing and the Lord will take care of it we had a testimony meeting and I will get to the to the word of the Lord so let's just saying open the eyes of my heart it's better Ernie Villanueva comes to minister unto us opening [Music] [Applause] I want to see [Music] amen and a lesson until God does open the eyes of our heart then we're living beneath our privileges and there's only one thing greater in life than happiness and that's holiness and the thing is you don't get holy in a hurry it takes time to be holy it takes time to recognize that we in this journey down on earth we're just a little a speck of Earth that God has quickened just temporarily with this brilliant light of his gospel to become a part of the family of God and to fulfill the purpose that God had in the beginning and that was to have a bride that would rule and reign with him throughout eternity god bless you you can have your seats for just a moment and I'd like to give a little testimony I want to keep it real short and say if you don't mind if I could speak like a northerner because I came from Rhode Island and I was just back there a couple of months ago and and it was really it was really a unique experience to get around my family and to see how fast they talked they would tell me what an accent that I had so I went to my church and I asked if I would be able to speak like a northerner so I could speak a lot in a little bit of time so they said it was okay so many years ago I had always wanted to find somebody else that was in the message from the state of Rhode Island and for thirty years the answer was no no no never found one person in the entire message from Rhode Island so a few years ago I was in Massachusetts with brother of Simon Peter Sesay and asked that question again it was no and then a couple of years later I was visiting my mom in Rhode Island and from the airport there's a little little airport from there to my mother's house is three miles and in the middle of that that trip I got a phone call from this brother Matthew who was in that meeting in Massachusetts who I had not seen for two years and he said brother Ernie the Lord has led me to start a church in Rhode Island so wow I was that was amazing so we met and we talked so just a few months ago I was there and he asked me to come and so he texted me the address of the church I said what that's a real familiar Street I've been up and down that street thousands of times when I was a young boy because it was the Main Street near my house so anyways I'm going to the church and I went by my old house and I measured from my house to her the churches and it was three tenths of a mile and then I didn't even know it but I looked at the street that I used to live in and it was 26 mystic Street so I lived in Providence Rhode Island I had no idea what Providence meant until I got saved in a Baptist Church and and then I had no idea what a mystic was until brother Branham spoke about the mystical body of the Lord Jesus Christ and you look up the word mystic and the definition of a mystic is one who seeks after and attains direct intercourse with God and and that's what the bride has Jesus Christ coming down making love to his bride whispering secrets in her ears and these secrets are only for his bride the rest of the world has no interest in hearing these things and so that's that's my little testimony and the church that started there there's a lot of African brothers that have moved to that part of the of the country and it's a very very thriving it's a it's a real a prosperous church and I was so thankful to see the message starting to take root right near my own house and now my family now when I tell them about the gospel of Jesus Christ I've got a place to be able to send them and one of them that really is going to need a miracle it's my mother's sister is my aunt Jean she's 89 years old a Catholic nun and unwind a Catholic mind when she's 89 years old that's that's a real challenge so if you pray for her and I've got I've got two sisters and brother and and cousins and nephews and nieces and a lot of them that are there and I am holding the token over them like like you're hold the token over your family and your loved ones and you know the token sometimes is not just like well you know it's a little my token and some people think it's like a little magic wand I got the token but sometimes that token is proactive things like sitting down and writing a letter a handwritten letter and then put a stamp on it and mail it snail mail and so they get that letter in their shock davina and then they open it up and it's a handwritten letter and they read it and then the psychologist they say when somebody gets a handwritten letter nowadays they will read that letter like three times what a letter and they they want to read what's the what are they up to what are they saying and they'll read it three times and then put it away and sometimes pick it up again and so sometimes as little things like that as opposed to just a text or an email which are nice and a phone calls nice but something that they know that you have taken some time and and for a husband or wife might be good for you so once in a while to send a love letter maybe like you used to do when your sweethearts when when you were young and husbands wives mothers fathers children you know it goes it goes always and brother branham said without perfect love you're not a candidate for the rapture and so every day when I wake up that is my goal in life it's perfect love now I've got people who are enemies to me because of what I believe in the word and they tell me I'm a nut and I said I might be a nut but I'm screwed to the right boat I am screwed to thus saith the Lord so I have people who are enemies to me but I am NOT an enemy to anybody in the world and I can say that before God but you know to enter into that channel of perfect love when I wake up in the morning I know there's got to be two deaths I gotta die and the devil's got to die first thing in the morning just bind the yapping dog tell him he has no authority over you and your life and live that victorious life now will there be challenges yeah will there be tests will it be disappointments yeah that's that's life but the Bride of Christ she overcomes all those things were made for that we're pressurized for that and the love that that you have in your church I was telling brother Sam this church has a level of agape love that is rare in the message churches around the world and sometimes you may take that for granted because you know it's just my pastor's brother Sam brother Wade and and you know the church but you never ever ever take the grace of God and the love of God and the leadership of God never take those things for granted because they are they are precious in the sight of God and so before I open the word I want to just give you a little exhortation we all know the story of the rich young ruler and so when you think about that title this man he was rich he was young he was a ruler probably had wonderful the the best clothes there was he had lived a lifestyle that most people could have only dreamed of but the greatest thing that the rich young ruler had was the opportunity to come face-to-face with the Lord Jesus Christ because very few people in his day had that opportunity and when he had the opportunity he had the right question he had the most important question any man or any woman could ever ask and that is what must I do to inherit eternal life and he asked only person in the world who could give him the exact answer that he needed and so Jesus loving him he looked into his future and he saw that money was going to become the god of the rich young ruler so he told them go and sell everything that you have give it to the poor and come and follow me now the rich young ruler he's looking at Jesus and he'd heard wonderful things about him and he wanted the audience with him which he got but when Jesus told him go sell everything that you leave your lifestyle of privilege and pleasure and give everything you have to the poor and come and follow me and the rich ruler is looking at him you mean follow a homeless man and this bunch of people has with them that don't know we don't have a home to live in don't know worth you know we're they gonna stay the night or were they gonna feed and so the rich young ruler he did a manifestation of every person one of three this message the gospel it will make you either mad or glad or sad and for the rich young ruler it made him very sad and he walked away but that was not the end of the rich young ruler because through the eye of a prophet we see him in torment but God allows him to see Abraham and Lazarus in his bosom and he cries out he said father Abraham let Lazarus come and drop a couple of drops of water in my tongue Abraham said no I can't do that he said there is a great gulf fixed he cannot come to where you are and you cannot come to her he is and so the rich young ruler he was not done yet because now he said well if he can't come to her I am and then I have another plan let Lazarus mount a great evangelistic crusade and send him to my family and warn them that they don't wind up in this wicked place where I am and Abraham said no I can't do that said they have Moses they have the law they have the prophets and if one rose from the dead still they would not believe so just in just at one moment before we get into the word we can look back as a Monday Morning Quarterback so to speak and we can say how how did that man turn down the greatest opportunity of his life to become a follower of the Lord Jesus Christ and have eternal life so we can look back at him but tonight we have a more up-to-date experience and an invitation to become a follower of Jesus Christ and we have vindication thousands of indications of who God was in this day and it's like a neon strobe light of Revelation and stimulation activation motivation and when you receive that there is an anointing that comes and you're energized and stimulated and quickened and and supercharged with the revelation that you are a child of God and you're down here and God has allowed you to live in the closing moments of time and God has trusted you to overcome the most wicked the most perverted the most despondent age of all time and God has trusted you and I to live in this day and overcome let's stand to our feet I'd like to bring you greetings from our assembly up in Cloverdale from brother Bisco and brother Tom and brother Tim and brother John brother Murphy and all the ministers up there and we still have very very fond memories one of the finest meetings that we've ever had was the meetings that brother Sam sponsored here in in Gainesville years ago and it's a real real it's a real wonderful memory for me you know in in my mind I've named my mind my mind is the village of anything is possible and in and in my memory it's a dream machine of excitement and enchantment and ecstasy and and it's it's it's it's aware of the day that we're living in and and what an excitement that that this message brings to me and I trust it will bring to you so we're going to invite you to open your Bibles to Leviticus in chapter 2 and we're going to start reading in verse 1 but before we read let's pray father we've heard wonderful singing this afternoon we've heard a wonderful testimony of a young man that you have gripped his heart so thankful for that father blessed this blessed this brother and lead him and guide him into a deeper and a fuller relationship with you and now Lord what comes to the most important part of our service and that is your sacred word and first of all we want to say that we are aware that in this building even though we cannot see them with our natural eyes we know that there are supernatural beings in this room and I pray that that somebody maybe who is not aware of that at this moment before the end of the service that they would be aware that God is calling them to a supernatural life a supernatural experience that was so far exceed any dream or any plan or any expectation that they have ever had in their life and they would make you the number one priority father we pray that you would bless both speaker and hear and only you would be seen and glorified and we ask this in the wonderful name of our Lord Jesus Christ amen amen I'd like to speak about our supernatural opportunity and responsibility a supernatural opportunity and responsibility so in Leviticus chapter 2 and verse 1 and when any will offer a meat offering unto the Lord his offering shall be a fine flower and he shall pour oil upon it and put frankincense thereon and he shall bring it to Aaron's sons the priests and he shall take their out his handful of the flour thereof and of the oil thereof with all the frankincense thereof and the priests shall burn the memorial of it upon the altar to be an offering made by fire of a sweet savour unto the Lord you can have your seats now I would challenge you to think sometime later on mark down Leviticus 2 and go into it in detail but I'm just going to skim through it but in the ingredients of this this meat offering we're told that there are several ingredients that need to be hidden and several ingredients that need not to be it number one there had to be the flour the fine flour and brother branham speaks about and 28 times he speaks about a little device they had called a bur and this this device would take every piece of that that meal and it would take it and it would grind it down and it would be exactly the same size and then to this fine flour that had to be oil and then there had to be frankincense added to that and later on in the chapter were told that this could be placed upon an altar or it could be in the oven or it could be in the pan or it could be in the frying pan and we're also told that you don't put any leaven in this meat offering and you don't put any honey in the offering and later on we're told near the end of the chapter with every one of these offerings make sure you put the salt in that offering and so in Leviticus it lays down the type now brother Branham said something he said I am a type ologist and any man who truly knows this Bible will be a typology now I had just graduated from Bible School nine months before the message came to me and I did not know what a type was and I didn't know what a shadow was I knew about homiletics I knew about hermeneutics I knew about how to structure a sermon how to get an introduction and get an illustration in point one point two point three and then have a conclusion and then hang the people's souls over the fire and call for an altar call so we were trained how to do that we we're well acquainted but when I heard about topologists I had no idea what brother Branham was speaking about and so I had to begin to search and back in those days that was in 1983 we did not have a computer so you could not just put in you know like nowadays you can put a perfect type of or a type if you can do that and like in in seconds you can see all the things brother Branham had to say a perfect type of or a type of and so these are types that are laid out in Leviticus this is a a meal offering and so we'll come back this a little bit later but remember there's the flour and the oil and the frankincense no 11 no honey and salt and it's an altar or the oven or the pan or the frying pan now will turn over to second Kings chapter 16 in verse 23 it's a scripture that most people who are acquainted with the message are very familiar with so all Marie slept with his father's and was buried in Samaria and a hab his son reigned in his stead and in the 38th year of the king of ask the king of Judah began a hab the son of Omri to reign over Israel and a hab the son of Omri reigned over Israel in Samaria twenty and two years so that was the length of his reign and a hab the son of Omri now listen to this very striking and a hab the son of Omri did evil in the sight of the Lord above all a ll above all that were before him and it came to pass as if it had been a light thing for him to walk in the sins of jeroboam the sons of nabad that he took to wife Jezebel the daughter of F Bell king of the zidonians and went and sir Bale and worshipped him and he reared up an altar for bail in the house a bail which he had built in Samaria and a have made a grove and Ahab did more to provoke the Lord God of Israel to anger than all the kings of Israel that were before so this was not an ordinary King this was a king of Israel and he went and he married Jezebel which was a heathen a raw pagan and she influenced him and this king of Israel now he disobeys the first commandment which I have no strange gods before you I'm the Lord your God and and so now this altar is is reared up and and it angers the Lord and out of nowhere we don't hear a lot about his history or his background but in in second Kings verse first came 17 and Elijah the Tishbite who was of the inhabitants of Gilead said unto a hab as the Lord God of Israel liveth before whom I stand there shall not be dood nor rain these years but according to my word now Elijah comes out of nowhere but here's a hab and Jezebel and there is sin in the camp and and in the country of Israel the children of God have been seduced and are now intoxicated by false gods and are under the influence of a king who's under the influence of his pagan wife and so God is not pleased with that and Elijah comes said no reigns going to fall until I fall for it now you here in Georgia are familiar with farming you know that where there's no rain that the crops fail and there's famine drought and when those things happen there's hunger and starvation that comes so after Alijah pronounces this this drought that's going to come no rain so he went and did according under the word of the Lord for he went and dwelt by the brook Cherith that is before Jordan brother Branham said this was the driest place in the land and the Ravens brought him bread and flesh in the morning and bread and flesh in the evening now you have got to have an element of the supernatural to believe that Ravens brought Elisha bread and flesh in the morning and bread and flesh in the evening now what bakery did the Ravens go to to get the bread from and where did they get the flesh from and this was the driest place in the land but yet there's a brook that's bubbling there and brother Branham said that God wanted three and a half years of intimate fellowship personal fellowship just him and his prophet now the rest of the world down below they are slowly going into a crazy mode because because now there's no food and there's no water now a hab he says all right we are issuing an APB all-points bulletin we need that man everything was going fine in the kingdom until that guy showed up we don't know where he's at but you find him police military everybody you go and search every inch of land until you find that guy and you bring him here meanwhile here's Elisha imagine with him and him in the Lord having this wonderful time of fellowship and no doubt God is equipping Elisha for the mission that lies ahead of him now I can just imagine and this is my mother I can imagine these soldiers and the military and and don't have a lot of water and don't have a lot of food brother Wade and no doubt their electrolytes are getting a little bit low they're probably walking a little bit slower and they're looking around they've got to find this guy looking everywhere and they probably came to that place where the mountain was were Elijah wa and they said there's nothing up there we know that's the driest place in the whole country we're not gonna waste any energy going up there because of nothing can be up there and so they went and they bypass it and so then the brook dries up and then God tells him the word of the Lord came and him saying arise and get these Zarafa now the word zero path means a place it's a refiner of metals a refiner and so he goes to zero path which belonging to Zion and dwell there behold I have commanded a widow woman to feed thee so this is God's plan God before the foundation of the world he knew and lied you is going to be there he knew he was gonna call for the famine he knew all the things that were going to take place and he knew that was going to be a widow woman that was going to sustain his prophet now I have looked at all the things brother Branham speaks so much about the widow woman and Elijah and all the things that take place and so he says I have commanded this widow woman to sustain thee so he arose and went to Zarephath and when he came to the gate of the city behold the widow woman was there gathering of sticks our brother bran said it was two sticks not three not four not five but two sticks like like a crow and she's gathering the sticks and he called to her and he said fetch me I pray thee a little water in a vessel that I might drink and as she was going to fetch it now think about water was the most precious commodity in the land water and food and here this perfect stranger shows up at the the widow woman's door and he asked her for a drink of water and he says as she was going to get him a drink then he adds to the message she was ready to obey the first part of the message and as she was going to fetch it he called to her and said bring me I pray thee a morsel of bread in thine hand and she said oh she that stopped her right there she said as the Lord liveth I have not a cake but a handful of meal in a barrel and a little oil and a cruse and behold I am gathering two sticks that I may go in and dress it for me and my son that we may eat it and die she knew she was down to the end a little meal and a little bit of oil now as you go through the message brother Branham talks about this this widow woman he says now think about now profit you've got to have an element of life I call it supernatural animation it's like Walt Disney he was able take all the pictures of the cartoons and speed him up and all of a sudden he had Mickey Mouse and Minnie Mouse and Daffy Duck at all all the Disney characters well in Supernatural animation God shows us through the eye of his prophets and God takes his profit like a submarine under the ocean and that submarines got a periscope and if the captain wants to find out what's going on above the ocean he says up scope and the scope goes up and that scope looks all around 360 degrees and so the eye of a prophet is God's newsman and God can take that prophet and he can point him backwards he can point him forward he has taken him back before the foundation of the world and shown you what was taking place there he has shown you Lucifer and how he deceived the third of the angels he has shown us in detail what took place in the Garden of Eden he's described the serpent he's described Eve with a beautiful long blonde hair and a bright blue now think about this is a prophet he's no he's not just he's not just thinking about this he's not just you know giving you his idea of it his eyes are right back there and he says I'm just showing you what God showed me and so brother Graham says she was weary unable to sleep all night she was tossed about because of this great tragedy big tears dripping from her eyes for many weeks she had only one meal every three or four days for many weeks one meal every three or four days her husband had been lost in the battle for the Lord he trusted God and gave his life for the cause of Israel he was a Gentile he was a Gentile warrior and she was a Gentile widow her ragged nightgown was just about gone her sleeves were all ragged her arm sticking out of them she lived decent and honorable and met all of God's requirements but still the Lord remains silent he goes deep more detail her shoulders were stooped as she sat in a rocking chair shedding big tears and looking at her starving baby her cheekbones sticking out her arms frail as she sat ringing her bony hands her bones were dwindling away as the flesh goes from them what a vivid picture he said she knew that only a handful of meals stood between her and death she wasn't going to eat of the cake she was going to make it and she was going to feed her little boy and put him in her arms and die now I don't know if any of you have ever been at that point of total desperation this woman was in total desperation there was no hope on the horizon but she lived true and honorable to God and at the right time God had his man to come there brother Graham describes a little boy little boy was 3 or 4 years old he was unable to sleep over 20 minutes at a time because of his hunger he had on a ragged nightshirt he had sinking cheeks his eyes were turning yellow and he was holding his stomach as he asked his mother if she was ready to cook the little cake you mother's think about how you would have felt if your little boy or little girl 3 or 4 years old and you knew that you would right down to the end and you were gonna have your last meal and take your little baby in your arms and die that kind of desperation we can only imagine and then he talks about the conditions in the land the whole nation was starving and in a terrible condition the people in the city of Zaire path were starving to death screaming for water it was a reflection of sin and immorality as the woman looked down the street she heard the people cursing and carrying on they were in a tribulation for that day and they were just going insane kind of like the world that we're living in now the world today around outside of this message friends it is insanity there's only one sane mind and that is the mind of Christ outside of that the world has become an insane asylum and the inmates are running the asylum or they're running to try to run the asylum and they are cuckoo they are nuts and so now we see that that God speaks to this little widow woman and he said as the Lord thy God liveth I have not a cake but a handful of meal in a barrel and a little oil and a cruse and behold am gathering two sticks that I may go in and dress it for me and my son that we may eat it and I and Elijah said unto here fear not have you heard in this day fear not have you heard a prophet of God say the message came to take the fear off of the people fear fear fe8 false evidence appearing real false education appearing real Oh what most people do forget everything and run or what the bride does face everything and run that's what we do so he said fear not but go and do as thou has said but make me there up a little cake first and bring it unto me and after make for thee and for thy son for thus saith the Lord you know the day that you really understand what thus saith the Lord means in this day the first day the first day I can say that I really felt like like like I was getting it that I had entered into a supernatural realm and adoption I had just been given the left-foot of fellowship out of an Assembly of God Church because I heard about the oneness of the Godhead and baptism in Jesus name and I was in the UPC church for a while and and so here I am and in my friend brother aren t he's sharing the message with me and I'm listening to a tape and it was I was sitting in a street in Rock Hill South Carolina and I'm listening to brother Branham he's in the discernment line and he said now sister he said I don't know you and you don't know me but there is one here that does know you and does know me now please try to try to catch what he's saying he said now when he and his Spirit comes in me and my spirit goes away and he gives me a temporarily resurrection by my spirit and he wants to use my body and I'm so happy to loan it to him anything he can get out of it and I had heard brother Branham saying a son of man revealing the son of man and I got it and I never got confused about prophet I never got my eyes upon a man it was Christ but I knew Christ was now using his prophet in this day to attract my attention and to equip me for eruption I have been on the religious merry-go-round but that day I can say like you said brother you know that you know that you know but you know that you know because God has sent you and absolute and that absolute is perfect everything God does is perfect the Bible is sixty-six books by 40 different authors and everything comes together from perfection from the Jean chapter to Revelation but if a person misses what happened in Genesis 3 they take a detour in the Bible and they never recover from that detour and they will be found worshiping the Beast at the end in a tribulation period where it looks like the Beast is the only hope for the survival of the civilization of the world and without this message and without a token they'll be put into that tribulation and only the foolish virgins who will have to surrender become martyrs and give their life will make it and they will be great they don't have eternal life dwelling in them but they will be granted eternal life at that time so he tells her thus saith the Lord the barrel of meal shall not waste neither shall the cruse of oil fail until the day that the Lord sent his rain upon the earth and she went this is me and I went and did according to the saying of Elijah and she and he and her house did eat many days and the barrel of meal wasted not neither the cruse of oil fail according to the word of the Lord which he spoke by Elijah so now we've gone to Leviticus and now we see God's picking up his story in for in first Kings the meal the oil and the widow woman the sticks everything is is being put into play now we go into the New Testament and we see Jesus Jesus he was the bread of life that came down from heaven no he was the meal and when that fine meal when it was mingle with the spirit when the spirit and the oil were mingled and then there had to be frankincense added to that and what did Jesus say remember we talked about the leaven jesus said beware the leaven of the Pharisees Leviticus said don't put any leaven in there and I'll tell your friends I have seen so much eleven in my life I wish I hadn't seen a lot of the leaven that I've seen in my life I wish that I could unremember a lot of things about my past I wish there's a lot of things I could remember this remember about my religious experience before coming to the message but the leaven has got to be purged out and then no honey Jesus was not a honey Christian he was not one to walk drives whoo I praise the Lord glory to God hallelujah he was the he was a real man he was a real man of God a son of God and he was a real serious serious man and now we look at what they did to him they took him and we read in Matthew in 28 I'm just gonna speak a little bit fast now in Matthew 28 verse 45 now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land unto the ninth hour and about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice saying Eli Eli did a lot of us a baktun I that is to say my God my God why has thou forsaken me and some of them that stood there when they heard the saying this man calleth for Elias and straight away one of them ran took the sponge and filled it with vinegar and put it on a reed and gave him the drink the rest said let be let us see whether Elias will come to save him now think about now that what they had done to Jesus they had tortured Jesus they had first of all they whipped him with 39 lashes and those Roman soldiers they were masters of torture they would take that whip and called it a liqueur and it had little LED balls with little sharp nails at the end of it and they would take that whip and they'd snap that wick back and it would hit the flesh and rip the flesh out 39 times he got them then they took him and they kicked them and they punched them put a rag around his head and walked her out in the sucker punch okay and here here could you imagine you got a rag around your head and you don't know where the next punch is coming from and they're kicking you and screaming and cursing at you spitting at you rip his beard out of his face and by the time they got him to the cross friends you could you could hardly recognize who he was and hardly recognize there was a human being by the time they got him to there and those Roman soldiers they had crucified many they were desensitized to crucifixion they'd had the thieves and the murderers and the robbers sometimes it took three or four sold you to hold that guy down so they could nail him and they could and these guys were screaming and cursing but they'd never seen one come he came and he laid down on the cross and he stretched out his hands and he waited for the nails that he was the Lamb that that opened not his mouth and now they lifted him up and two thieves crucified left and right and both of them they're cursing at him and screaming insults at him but something happened during that time did a thief on the right I believe this my own thought it was the first example of the third pull that ever took place because that man never saw sign never saw wonder but he said out of his insanity is screaming just a short time from death he recognizes who it is he said Lord remember me when you come into your kingdom and Jesus in his agony he says to him this day thou will be with me in paradise and so then he cried out Eli Eli lama sabachthani and behold this is verse 51 and behold the veil of the temple was rent and trained from the top to the bottom and the earth did quake and the rocks friend now here's the scripture you won't hear many times if ever in a denominational Church and the graves were opened and many bodies of the saints which slept arose and came out of the graves after his resurrection and went into the holy city and appeared unto many now we have a bird's-eye view of what took place brother Branham said they came up and Abraham and Sarah came over said Lord would it be okay if we kind of took a little Whistlestop tour around Jerusalem and see how things have changed since we been there and Lord yeah go ahead he knew he's gonna be there for 40 days go ahead and they're walkin around Jerusalem and then he's all somebody might recognize it and they disappeared like Jesus could appear and disappear Abraham and Sarah and the Saints that came out of of the grave now remember Jesus said no leaven no honey and he said there has to be salt and Jesus in the midst of his persecution now some people go through a persecution it might be a little persecution but Jesus went through a horrible persecution it was not on the altar it was not in the oven it was not in the pan it was a frying pan experience he was in utter humiliation stripped and beaten and tortured naked before the whole world why for me and for you for our sins for our healing so that we could receive this and reign throughout all eternity with him and so the Saints came out of the graves and appeared unto many what happened a resurrection and then shortly after that there was a rapture that took place now we can see this clearly from Leviticus the first King now Jesus life now we get down to the where the rubber meets the road your life my life you're a body this body it may be young it may be old it was a lot of there's a lot of people that are young and they're strong and handsome and beautiful but their souls are ugly before God the most beautiful Hollywood starlet the most the most gifted singers and in all the politicians in the businessman they might be they look like they got it all swagger look good smell good Walker talk good live large but their soul is ugly before God and then there are people just a few years short of the time they're going to leave the earth and maybe we don't walk as fast as we used to maybe the wrinkles are starting to come and the gray hairs are starting to come but if you're a son or daughter of God in his sight your soul is beautiful it's so beautiful in his sight it's an eternal soul going to rule with him in the splendor of youth and vitality but what do you have to do this this body this this flesh it has to be anointed your meal has to be anointed with the Holy Ghost there has to be the oil that has to come now that when the oil and the meal when it's mixed together real good and then again what in Leviticus say don't put any leaven in there and so we need to be strict of every bit of leaven denominational leaven the worldly leaven you know people say you know oh my son Johnny you know he comes to bed early he's in bed by 8 o'clock or 9 o'clock and he's safe in his bed oh really safe he's got the tree of the modern tree of the knowledge of good and evil in his hands and he's travelling around the world traveling to Europe and Australia all his so-called friends sending pictures receiving pictures Satan has put in your hands my hands the tree of the knowledge of good and evil now we can look back and we can say how can Eve have ever done what she did how could she had been deceived by that slicker the serpent let me ask you are you being deceived it's Hollywood movies music television romance dramas and I can name 20 things and Satan has been deceiving man for 6,000 years that we have record of and he and his demons they are they are fine-tuned they know who you are they know your email address they know your Facebook page if you got snapchat or anything he knows who you are and the word dasya has been floated for the last couple years while satan has got a dossier he's got a document of your life he knows where you're weak he knows where he has deceived you in the past and sometimes he will come see me like a SWAT team will come and just come like a flood and just come and raise up some kind of a temptation around you or put some put you some kind of a circumstance were you you're just bound to have to do - just deceive yourself and to have to bow to the will of Satan you make compromises in your life and say that you know he doesn't care where he gets worship from if it's Hindu worship Buddhist worship Muslim worship if it's denominational worship if it's agnostic worship if it's atheist he does not care as long as you don't find this truth you know they tried to figure out how many people are following the message around the world and they come up with some astounding figures is it ninety-nine point nine nine nine percent of the people in the world do not know and follow this message and all of its truth think about that and you have been selected and collected and protected to be ejected out of this world one day either by rapture or you go the way of the grave and brother Branson a Christian can't die to be absent from the body is to be present with the Lord you take your last breath here and your neck on the other side you being glory and so that is our inheritance but there's a responsibility there is an opportunity to be a part of the kingdom of God to present as Romans 12:1 says present your body as a living sacrifice holy acceptable unto God which is your reasonable service that means this body has to be anointed with the true Holy Ghost and the only evidence that a person has received the true Holy Ghost is they can receive the revelation of the message for their day and manifest the life that's the only evidence that somebody has received the true Holy Ghost they might have it on their flesh they might have it on their spirit they might be a false anointed one as sister Peggy was talking about she says she had a hard time with that one that somebody could be anointed with the Holy Ghost and go to hell that's some deep swimming waters friends where would we be if brother Branham had not preached the anointed one at the end how many questions would we have unanswered so now this body has to be anointed with the holy gold leaven is purged out and you become a real son of God a real daughter of God not one of these honey Christian praise the Lord glory to God Jesus was not that kind of a man and I say praise the Lord Allah I say glory to God but I mean it when I say I say it with the depth of sincerity praise my God praise you think about a king or a queen of all the ages past and if one of their subjects was given an invitation to present themselves before the king of that day or the queen of that day how much time and preparation and planning I'm going to see the king I gotta make sure my curtsy is right I gotta make sure I present my and present myself right before the king now they did that in the natural realm how much more we in the spiritual realm in a supernatural realm first of all you have to have a revelation of who the king is and you have to have a revelation that you are kings and priests sons and daughters of God here on the earth a supernatural civilization on a mystical supernatural journey this message is spoken in a language it takes a token to understand this message without the token you'll sit there and I might as well be speaking Italian or Greek or French or German as one of our sisters here in the Church of speaking German now so without the Holy Ghost friends you are missing it and how do you get it the Bible said those who diligently search after me not that you could go searching after God but God found you first God finds you here in this church tonight and he calls you then when he calls you then he said now go in search after me search my word search my message search after me with prayer and fasting and praise and rejoicing recognize who you are and then there's got to be salt in there you've got to preserve we've seen over the last few years friends i've watched men that i've walked with for 30 sometimes over 40 years and see them walk away from the message it's like a supernatural insanity has struck that person and it's like the revelation the so-called revelation they said they had it seemed like it came supernaturally and it seemed like it leaves supernaturally it seemed like you look I've looked at if I've look right in their eyes in a sight looking at a house brother dick and all the lights are on but nobody's home anymore the person I used to think I knew and the person that is there now there's no way you can reconcile them the Bible said he that endures until the end the same shall be saved salt preservative preservative keep away it preserves you it keeps away all the stagnation and then finally what do we have to do like Jesus Jesus presented himself and he took up his cross and he laid down and he waited for the nails to come now friends that there's nobody there's no Christian that I ever know of who has not had challenges in their life and maybe that challenge has been something known only between you and God so I call that something maybe it's kind of like an oven experience just you and God knows about it but then sometimes things happen and circumstances happen and sicknesses come and things come and then it's known by you to your pastor and the congregation and everybody knows what you're going through everybody know you've got this you've got this disease you guys need this operation and everybody knows this challenge that you're going through and that's like a that's like a pan experience but then there is what they call the frying pan experiences and I went through one of those a couple of years ago friends and it is no picnic and it is it is humiliating it is embarrassing and you just can't believe that this is happening to you and the whole church knows about this challenge you're going they know you can't go for the bed to the bathroom almost and you're not able to work and you're not able to function and you're reduced to a helpless dependence upon God and through that challenge brother Branham says present your body a living sacrifice holy acceptable unto God which is your reasonable service I did that over and over and over and I was telling brother Wade in June last night that God spoke to me in simplicity I read the scripture and the scripture says and it came to pass well it came to pass it didn't come to stay brother Sam it came to pass and I just thought it could better that yeah I'm in a challenge now but this challenge it didn't come to stay it came to pass and I began confessing that and confessing the confessing it and confess to you and my faith was increased and then out of nowhere brother Gary he sent me some cream for my feet and I got a little bit of relief and I could walk and I could move around a little bit and and my face seemed to grow and grow and grow and grow and finally just walk right out of it the doctor said it was impossible I'm sure they're people right here and have gone through situations in your life maybe you've been diagnosed with diseases and the doctor says there is no hope there is nothing we can do how many times that we heard brother Branham had people come before the doctors turned you over nothing he can do you believe do you believe you believe that's the key friends it's your faith now in this last day last thing is a hab in the land today oh yeah a hab is in the land is Jessie Bell in the land today oh yeah jessabelle religion it's all around so Ahab and Jezebel and then what else happened they started worshiping something other than the one true Living God and what happened Elijah showed up and Elijah said there is going to be no rain there's going to be a famine in this day there is a famine in the land for the hearing of the true Word of God lots of natural food people are buying and selling and giving a marriage you know and it's before the end time friends when all the earthquakes and the volcanoes and the floods everything's happening but there's going to be prosperity buying and selling jesus said as it was in the days of sodom so shall it be in the days of the coming of the Son of man as it was in the days of Noah so shall it be in the coming of the Son of man you look back friends not many were saved in Noah's day he preached for 120 years and only his family entered it in Sodom's day only lot and his two daughters came out your brother Branham talks about what when the angel came and the men the men was so perverted and they saw these two men walk in there and they began screaming give us those men they were perverts they were homosexual scream give us those men in LA came a hood that says no I've got my two daughters take no we don't want we don't want women we want then and so the angels came up and smote him blind he reads the Bible and said it's still they we read themselves trying to find the door we still want you we're blind but we still want those men blind miserable wretched poor naked look at look at our presidential situation you know it this work America friends they have Jezebel Jezebel's the only ones that's going to bail out a hab in this day he's got the gold and the paper and we're the ones that are going to have to be bailed out we've been bankrupt since the 50s I became no no water famine lasting friends you and I we need to pick up our cross get on that cross and become a living not a dead sacrifice a living sacrifice a happy sacrifice you know the the balancing act of a Christian friends it's a real balancing act you got to be holy happy and humble a lot of people if you're too happy you're not humble enough if you're too humble you're not happy enough but we can be holy and happy and humble because we know that we are a child of God we know that by predestination we can look back we know we came from God and we're going back to God let's stand to our feet friends you know a while ago I was on a plane and I was flying and I remember how brother branham one time he had that little track pick up your pen and write so I started thinking you know all the things I've been through and it's amazing that the memory this little this little three and a half pound mass that we've got enough it can remember in vivid details things from our childhood and the good and the bad and the ugly all the things that have happened to us so I started thinking if it had not been for this message coming my way I want to speak real fast if it hadn't been for the message how would you know that Abraham and Sarah would change back to young again or Noah and the Ark had never rained one time before that time how would you know King Saul was saved how would you know he'll was not eternal the truth about baptism godhead Holy Ghost the two witnesses the 144,000 the souls under the altar Church ages seals serpent seed how would you measure the future home of the heavenly bride and bridegroom this is only for the bride friends the rest of the world they think this is crazy you would not understand the Antichrist the false prophet the beast a the harlot the number the name the mark the image all these things would be unknown to you it would be a closed book to you you would be underprivileged child you would not know about adoption and predestination or the statute of a perfect man marriage divorce you would not know about Satan's Eden the god of this evil age Jezebel religion doing God a service without it being his will and because of what we do know then we are new creatures in Christ your attributes of God thoughts of God offspring genes the sperm of God your God's victory over Satan in this generation you're the overcomers of the name the number of the mark the image the Beast the the harlot deception sin and the world that's a pretty good legacy I would say the rich young ruler had a good legacy we've got a better legacy you are a new species you're a divine supernatural

only eternal opportunity that a man or a woman will ever have prophet of God said we only live once we only have one opportunity to prove to God if we really love him and if we will serve Him and
