[45:16] that Old
[45:18] lious still stands on calary

[47:27] ship would be we'd been crashed up
[47:29] against the Rocks that's right okay
[47:31] without that light we don't have
[47:33] anything to lead the way amen so we want
[47:36] to get into the word of God here this
[47:38] morning and uh we have a little thought
[47:41] we'd like to share with you uh it's a
[47:43] little uh series that I had ministered
[47:46] at my church here not long ago and um I
[47:49] believe um that the Lord laid this back
[47:52] on my heart to speak here amen um and I
[47:56] pray this will be a blessing to you but
[47:57] we want to turn our bibles if you would
[48:00] over to uh
[48:02] Ephesians Ephesians uh chapter uh 2 and
[48:07] verse one and also if you would turn
[48:09] your Bibles our main uh scripture text
[48:11] will be St
[48:12] John 11 and we would begin reading uh in
[48:17] um verse um I'd say uh 21 or
[48:21] 22 but we want to just take a little
[48:24] thought here uh this this morning and
[48:26] and possibly if the Lord would lead us
[48:29] if we go into that direction we just
[48:30] want to be led of the Holy Spirit
[48:32] whatever he would have us to say but we
[48:35] want to just share a little thought
[48:37] about the resurrection of Lazarus and uh
[48:40] I'd like for you to see some things in
[48:42] here about the resurrection of Lazarus
[48:43] and I believe that you begin to see what
[48:46] it is that Lazarus went through and went
[48:49] what he went down with yeah what he came
[48:52] up with yeah and what he overcome amen I
[48:55] believe you'll see a lot of yourself in
[48:57] there amen so we want to begin reading
[48:59] in in
[49:01] Ephesians and this a well-known
[49:03] scripture and I believe that this it
[49:05] begins it says and you have he quickened
[49:08] who were dead in trespasses and in sins
[49:11] right wherein in times past you walked
[49:14] according to the course of this world
[49:17] according to the prince of the power of
[49:19] the air the spirit that now worketh in
[49:22] the children of Disobedience but aren't
[49:24] you thankful it doesn't work in you
[49:26] anymore amen among whom also we all had
[49:30] our conversations in times past in the
[49:33] lust of our flesh fulfilling the desires
[49:37] of the Flesh and of the mind and were by
[49:40] Nature the children of Wrath even as
[49:43] others ain't that powerful but God who
[49:47] is rich in Mercy amen for his love great
[49:51] love wherewith he loved
[49:53] us I like I I that just touches my heart
[49:56] when I hear him say he loved me amen
[49:59] amen even when we were dead in
[50:03] sins hath quickened us together with
[50:06] Christ by Grace ye are saved and hath
[50:09] raised us up together and made us set
[50:14] together in Heavenly places in Christ
[50:18] Jesus now if you notice that that's from
[50:21] one condition to another condition
[50:23] exactly amen hallelujah
[50:26] praise God now let's take our bibles if
[50:28] you would let's just turn right over
[50:30] here to St John and uh we won't read a
[50:33] just a lot the scripture is just the
[50:35] whole scripture is just full of
[50:36] wonderful nuggets amen but let's just
[50:38] begin reading where it says in verse uh
[50:42] 21 then Martha said unto Jesus Lord if
[50:45] thou had been here my brother had not
[50:48] died but I know that even now whatever
[50:51] thou will ask of God God will give it to
[50:54] thee amen Jesus said unto her thy
[50:56] brother shall rise again Martha said
[50:59] unto him I know that he shall rise again
[51:02] in the resurrection at the last day
[51:06] Jesus said unto her I am the
[51:09] resurrection and the life and he that
[51:12] believeth in me though he were dead yet
[51:15] shall he live and whosoever liveth and
[51:18] believeth in me shall never die
[51:21] believest thou this amen she said unto
[51:24] him yay Lord I believe that thou art the
[51:26] Christ the son which shall come into the
[51:29] world now let's just flip over here to
[51:32] 43 if we
[51:33] would and when he thus had spoken he
[51:37] cried with a loud voice
[51:39] Lazarus come
[51:41] forth and he that was
[51:44] dead came forth bounded hand and foot
[51:48] with grave clothes and his face was
[51:51] bound about with a napkin Jesus said
[51:54] unto them
[51:55] loose him amen and let him go amen let's
[52:01] just bow our heads Heavenly Father Lord
[52:04] we come to you this morning Lord and we
[52:06] ask you Lord that you would speak
[52:07] through your servant Lord and the words
[52:09] that you have laid upon his heart father
[52:12] we would ask you in Jesus name God that
[52:14] you would come down now Lord Jesus move
[52:16] your servant out of the way Lord bless
[52:18] the ears of the hears that have come
[52:20] Lord I know they're looking to hear
[52:22] something father and we ask you God that
[52:24] you would just speak to us in Jesus name
[52:26] we pray amen amen God bless you Saints
[52:29] you may be
[52:31] seated amen I'm going take my coat off
[52:33] here bless so if I preach too long just
[52:36] pull on my cooktail
[52:39] God bless everybody we want to take our
[52:41] thought here this morning out of
[52:44] Ephesians 2 And1 and it
[52:46] says you who he ha quickened right now
[52:50] we see the word uh Quicken and it means
[52:53] to be made alive right amen because we
[52:56] know one thing we know that we are the
[52:59] chosen of God that's right and we were
[53:01] chosen of him the Bible says in
[53:03] Ephesians I believe it says that he
[53:05] chose us in love go amen he chose us in
[53:08] love Glory Church he didn't fall in love
[53:11] with us he always loved us see his love
[53:15] is greater than affiliate love amen but
[53:18] his love is so great that he loved you
[53:21] yeah when you was dead to him right
[53:24] right he loved you when you was a sinner
[53:27] he loved you when you was a drunker he
[53:30] loved you in that condition and he took
[53:33] you the way you were he didn't let you
[53:35] get cleaned up and then accept you amen
[53:38] but he saw you before the foundation of
[53:41] the world so what do we got to worry
[53:43] about
[53:44] right God is in control of every
[53:47] condition every situation that we go
[53:50] through we have to understand that
[53:53] praise be to God and we want to see um
[53:55] our scripture here and the thought that
[53:58] we want to bring out here is that we see
[54:01] a a Woman by the name of Martha right
[54:04] and we know that there's Martha there's
[54:06] Mary there's Lazarus and Lazarus we find
[54:09] out that he died right and we also find
[54:12] out that Jesus could not uh be around
[54:16] until he died right see sometimes things
[54:19] have got to get bad I hear a lot of
[54:21] people say well my marriage is just the
[54:23] worst it is well sometimes the worst has
[54:25] come before the
[54:26] better right hello I said sometimes the
[54:30] worst has to come before the better
[54:33] because that's the way it does Amen it
[54:36] that's not always better and then it's
[54:37] worse so sometimes the worse sometimes
[54:40] the cancer is worse before it gets
[54:42] better amen so don't always think when
[54:45] something gets worse that God can't
[54:47] handle it God can take every situation
[54:51] and I want to show you something here
[54:52] this morning just for a little season of
[54:54] time that we're going to speak this
[54:56] morning and perhaps as we carry it on
[54:58] this evening but what we want to talk
[55:00] about here is just a line of thought
[55:03] because what we want to see here is that
[55:06] Jesus had to
[55:08] leave and when he left the people there
[55:12] were waiting on him Mary and Martha had
[55:14] sent a word for Jesus come your your
[55:17] your friend the one that you love the
[55:19] one that loves you come and heal him do
[55:23] something but see Jesus couldn't do it
[55:26] right right right because he had seen a
[55:32] vision of a
[55:35] resurrection hallelujah amen Lazarus had
[55:39] gone down with something my brother and
[55:41] sister and that was potentials yeah
[55:45] right he went down into the grave with
[55:47] potentials yeah and I'm going to tell
[55:49] you if you don't have these potentials
[55:52] that Lazarus had if you don't have have
[55:55] these potentials that God is looking for
[55:58] then you're you're not going to
[56:00] resurrect you're not going to come forth
[56:02] exactly that's right because this is our
[56:03] line of thinking is coming forth
[56:07] overcoming all the things that are in
[56:11] your life right things that are of your
[56:15] past that are still trying to haunt you
[56:18] you know there's some people that are
[56:20] sitting in the message now that are
[56:22] still Bound in their mind cuz they don't
[56:24] TR God and release it to him what we try
[56:28] to do sometimes my brother and sister is
[56:31] we will give him our strengths oh yeah
[56:34] we'll give him our power we'll give him
[56:36] our our gifts we'll give him all these
[56:38] things but we won't give him our
[56:40] weaknesses right come on brother amen
[56:43] and that's what we need to do is take
[56:45] those weaknesses and give them the
[56:47] hearing because he can turn that
[56:50] situation around you see the only thing
[56:54] that could have right in this situation
[56:57] was a
[56:59] resurrection that's why I said sometimes
[57:02] things in your life have got to get bad
[57:04] but you have to still have the same
[57:06] faith and trust God Amen even if it gets
[57:10] worse even if the doctor looks at you
[57:13] and says well we there's no hope y see
[57:16] you got to realize one thing the doctor
[57:18] only knows what his book
[57:21] says he can only go by what his book
[57:23] says amen but we got a greater book my
[57:26] brother and sister and the great
[57:28] physician tells us that he can change
[57:30] the condition and I'm here to tell you
[57:32] this morning I don't care what kind of
[57:35] condition you're in I don't care what
[57:37] struggle you got right now I believe
[57:39] there's an hour when it's time for you
[57:42] to come forth and when that hour comes
[57:45] in your life there's no devil in hell
[57:48] going to stop you from coming forth
[57:50] hallelujah amen death couldn't stop it
[57:54] corruption couldn't stop it right praise
[57:57] God so here we are we see
[58:02] ourselves as the message tells us that
[58:05] God saw us not just saw us yeah but he
[58:09] chose us right right so his
[58:12] choice God's choice has to be a
[58:16] sovereign choice right so his choice has
[58:18] to be based on something Sovereign he
[58:21] has to have that sovereign
[58:25] so as we go back into the mind of God we
[58:27] find
[58:29] out that he was the lamb slain yeah
[58:34] before the foundation of the world right
[58:37] that's right so when God saw you and he
[58:41] chose you and he didn't just fall in
[58:44] love with you yeah exactly that's right
[58:47] he always loved you amen yes sir because
[58:49] you are a part of him and what you need
[58:52] to understand my brother and sister
[58:55] is the hour when you come forth to
[58:57] recognize what he's already done for you
[59:01] that the work is already over it's
[59:04] already done the price has already been
[59:07] paid and he's now saying to you come
[59:11] forth right amen right brother
[59:13] Hallelujah to God right but you know
[59:16] there's always those
[59:18] around
[59:19] and people have a
[59:22] problem with something yeah sure you
[59:25] know what that's called it's called
[59:27] stinking
[59:29] thinking abely Amen to that stinking
[59:34] thinking that's right
[59:36] amen because they cannot see you the way
[59:39] God sees you right right they cannot
[59:42] understand what it is that God has
[59:45] already done for
[59:47] youen Martha had come to a place she
[59:50] knew he was the Christ right but she
[59:53] needed more of a
[59:55] revelation and church sometimes he'll
[59:57] take the closest thing from you exactly
[1:00:00] to bring you to the place he'll take
[1:00:03] things from you just to Humble you and
[1:00:05] get you to the place where he wants to
[1:00:07] be able to work with you amen exactly I
[1:00:10] tell you as we look into this scripture
[1:00:12] we're going to see so many different
[1:00:14] little nuggets that just jump
[1:00:17] out and if we begin to look and we begin
[1:00:21] to see this
[1:00:23] scripture I want to read something to
[1:00:25] you that the prophet of God said go
[1:00:27] ahead and this is in the
[1:00:30] message um it's the rising of the
[1:00:34] sun it says now
[1:00:38] see now you're already
[1:00:42] resurrected amen when God raised him up
[1:00:45] he raised you up the sun is just there
[1:00:48] on you and now you are
[1:00:51] growing into the blossom life like like
[1:00:54] he was to be resurrected in the last day
[1:00:58] so my brother and sister you are growing
[1:01:01] to a full
[1:01:04] Resurrection but the work has already
[1:01:07] begun yes sir but our problem is we have
[1:01:10] those around with stinking
[1:01:13] thinking and sometimes we find if we're
[1:01:16] not careful that we might have stinky
[1:01:20] thinking right because we cannot Look
[1:01:23] What God Says we are right amen we
[1:01:27] struggle with the fact of what God says
[1:01:30] we are amen and the reason we do is
[1:01:33] because it takes a
[1:01:36] revelation it takes an understanding and
[1:01:39] brothers and sisters Lazarus came forth
[1:01:41] with something yeah he came forth the
[1:01:44] prophet of God says now watch the father
[1:01:46] told him one day Lazarus is going to die
[1:01:50] I want you to go away it's going to be
[1:01:52] so many days Jesus would without warning
[1:01:55] or anything obeyed the father and went
[1:01:59] away they sent him said Lazarus sick
[1:02:02] come pray for him Jesus just went on
[1:02:05] they sent him away and he just kept
[1:02:07] going yeah finally after the time was
[1:02:10] fulfilled that the father had showed him
[1:02:13] right oh I'll tell you when Lazarus came
[1:02:15] forth he didn't just come forth in a
[1:02:18] resurrection saints of God but he came
[1:02:20] forth with an understanding and what
[1:02:23] that understanding was is what the
[1:02:25] father had seen of him yeah Hallelujah
[1:02:29] Church you ain't just a church member
[1:02:32] here you're not just a church member
[1:02:34] come on brother exactly it should be
[1:02:36] more than that it should be deeper than
[1:02:38] that amen you should be looking in your
[1:02:41] life and say Lord where can I come forth
[1:02:44] Lord where is these things in my life
[1:02:46] that I've got to die out to where are
[1:02:49] these dead things that are trying to uh
[1:02:51] uh take me down right let me share
[1:02:53] something with you
[1:02:55] dead things can't hold
[1:02:59] you right that's right I've been to many
[1:03:02] funeral homes I never had a dead man
[1:03:04] reach out and grab
[1:03:05] me if I wanted to hold on to something
[1:03:08] dead I had to grab a hold of it that's
[1:03:10] right CU there's no life right right in
[1:03:14] that body that's right Hallelujah to God
[1:03:18] you think about that now you say well
[1:03:20] then I think I start to understand where
[1:03:22] my struggle is I'm not letting go of the
[1:03:25] Dead things right they're trying to that
[1:03:28] are trying to hold me trying to bind me
[1:03:31] trying to hold me down right see church
[1:03:34] you've got to be willing to let it go
[1:03:37] that's right because if you don't it
[1:03:41] won't let go of you right amen see you
[1:03:43] have to come to the place to where you
[1:03:45] say as Jesus told Lazarus he said
[1:03:48] Lazarus come forth so here it is say he
[1:03:52] wasn't just calling to a man to a
[1:03:55] resurrection but he was calling this man
[1:03:57] to something right he was calling him to
[1:04:00] an understanding he was calling him to a
[1:04:03] revelation right of what he went down
[1:04:06] let me tell you something when he came
[1:04:08] forth he recognized that what he
[1:04:10] believed is the truth right amen ain't
[1:04:13] it wonderful when you go through a trial
[1:04:15] when you go through a testing and you go
[1:04:16] through something and you find out you
[1:04:18] say Lord your word is real your word is
[1:04:20] the truth no other word could have done
[1:04:23] this no other Church no other man nor
[1:04:25] the Lord only you can do this amen but
[1:04:28] now watch this speaking of this
[1:04:30] Resurrection so he said that you now
[1:04:34] have the Potentials in you right now and
[1:04:37] the potentials that Lazarus went down
[1:04:39] with he said I am the resurrection and
[1:04:42] life he that believeth in me though he
[1:04:45] were dead yet shall he live so brothers
[1:04:48] and sisters the voice that was calling
[1:04:53] out
[1:04:54] was not just a voice right that's right
[1:04:58] amen but it is the voice that
[1:05:02] summons all things amen that's right oh
[1:05:07] I tell you is that voice speaking to you
[1:05:09] that's right amen if you're sitting in
[1:05:10] this assembly tonight you've already
[1:05:12] been in contact with the voice of the
[1:05:14] Resurrection Hallelujah that voice is
[1:05:16] already called out amen that voice has
[1:05:19] already brought you out of the Dead
[1:05:21] things it's already changed you from
[1:05:24] form to another form the prophet said
[1:05:26] from a sinner to a saint that's right so
[1:05:30] you no longer think on those things
[1:05:33] right exactly you know there are people
[1:05:36] in this
[1:05:38] world that are
[1:05:40] called
[1:05:43] niccs do you know what a nicc is I do
[1:05:47] that is a
[1:05:48] person that will hold on to dead things
[1:05:53] yeah
[1:05:55] that is a person that cannot release
[1:05:58] that which has died right that is a
[1:06:01] person that excuse my expression as you
[1:06:04] study into it you'll find out that it is
[1:06:07] a
[1:06:08] romance with the dead yeah they cannot
[1:06:12] release their dead mother their dead
[1:06:14] father they cannot release these things
[1:06:18] right and they hold on to them they dig
[1:06:22] them up out of the Grave yeah right
[1:06:25] right and they won't let go of what is
[1:06:28] already dead if God says it's dead then
[1:06:32] it's wreck and dead am exactly amen are
[1:06:36] you with me here
[1:06:38] Saints so we want to see here that if
[1:06:40] God says it's dead if God says it's done
[1:06:44] away with then why are people still
[1:06:47] struggling right Amen in that area of
[1:06:51] their life right I'm not exactly

[1:07:16] this world should be dead to
[1:07:20] us but try telling that to a nicic yeah

[1:17:47] bring into a church a situation to find
[1:17:52] out the maturity of the
[1:17:54] churches brother amen that's right and
[1:17:58] sometimes the pastor will know what's
[1:18:00] going on and why won't that brother why
[1:18:04] won't he do this why won't he take care
[1:18:05] of this why won't he straighten this out
[1:18:07] because he's waiting to see what the
[1:18:10] spirit is going to do to the yeah right
[1:18:13] sure come on church if the pastor
[1:18:16] attacked every single thing that come
[1:18:17] into the church You' have the most
[1:18:19] paranoid Church in the world exactly
[1:18:23] somebody walk in the
[1:18:27] church yeah right I got my eye on you
[1:18:34] buddy but see those Brothers with
[1:18:36] limited Grace they can all go so far
[1:18:40] right yeah but if the Life of Christ is
[1:18:43] in you and it's living in
[1:18:46] you you can Overlook if you're the
[1:18:50] statute of the perfect man right right
[1:18:53] and you've come to brotherly
[1:18:55] kindness brother brandom says brotherly
[1:18:58] kindness putting yourself in his place
[1:19:02] that's right in the matter right you'd
[1:19:04] be surprised how easy there'd be a lot
[1:19:05] of things that overcome and the
[1:19:07] struggles that you'd have if you could
[1:19:09] just put yourself in that other person's
[1:19:11] place right and you could just see it
[1:19:13] through their eyes you might find out
[1:19:15] that it's your fault right right amen
[1:19:18] right right see but we're talking about
[1:19:22] a Resurrection right and we're talking
[1:19:24] about a man who was in a condition and
[1:19:27] in that condition I
[1:19:30] mean it looked hopeless
[1:19:35] abely I mean Martha she was brother
[1:19:38] brandom said she had the right to abraid
[1:19:41] Jesus yeah but she didn't do it
[1:19:45] right but even in her own
[1:19:48] thinking yep she was
[1:19:51] say he stinketh yeah you want me to roll
[1:19:57] the the stone back yeah right well
[1:20:00] Martha didn't you
[1:20:02] say even now
[1:20:06] yeah even now
[1:20:09] Lord right if you had been here my
[1:20:12] brother would not have died but even now
[1:20:17] Lord help us Lord right see because if
[1:20:21] we're not careful
[1:20:23] our
[1:20:24] mind
[1:20:26] will lean in a
[1:20:30] direction because we have to have a
[1:20:32] revelation to understand what God is
[1:20:35] doing in our lives right amen see once
[1:20:37] you get a revelation then the rest is
[1:20:40] rest right amen
[1:20:43] exactly see once you begin to see what
[1:20:47] God is doing and leave it alone right
[1:20:51] brother come on and don't try try to
[1:20:53] poke at it right don't try to stir it
[1:20:57] but let God deal with the situation
[1:21:01] right amen because when you do that then
[1:21:04] you're beginning to
[1:21:06] overcome that way of stinky thinking
[1:21:11] yeah right because you don't you have to
[1:21:15] see it the way God sees it Glory that's
[1:21:17] right are you wouldn't here this morning
[1:21:19] praise God Amen so let's watch this here
[1:21:22] now because before the foundation of the
[1:21:24] world he saw you
[1:21:29] yeah and he chose
[1:21:32] you and the
[1:21:34] blood that was shed for you he chose you
[1:21:39] by
[1:21:42] Grace oh Hallelujah church that means
[1:21:45] something to
[1:21:48] me no wonder able when he offered unto
[1:21:53] God a more excellent sacrifice yeah than
[1:21:58] that of
[1:21:59] Cain because what Abel offered to God is
[1:22:04] what God had give to Abel right and now
[1:22:09] in worship he is now giving that back to
[1:22:12] God and God received his sacrifice why
[1:22:16] church because it match the Eternal
[1:22:19] sacrifice amen that's right exactly
[1:22:23] and see that's what our life has to do
[1:22:26] our life has to match what the word says
[1:22:30] our life has to come in order right and
[1:22:33] God is calling you each one of
[1:22:37] us to come
[1:22:40] forth come out of that situation right
[1:22:44] that you're in amen amen the voice that
[1:22:47] is calling you today that voice is the
[1:22:51] voice brother brother brand said that
[1:22:53] quickened you amen that is the same

[1:44:57] revelation and an understanding of
[1:44:59] something God had done for them and it
[1:45:02] became so real to them I mean people
[1:45:05] were falling out being slain we had a
[1:45:08] 2hour something prayer meeting people
[1:45:10] were being healed delivered set free
[1:45:13] because they had come to the place where
