amen do you want to see himen after all of these years now I want to see them don't you and good to see everybody in the house of the Lord youd like turning your scriptures turn where we've been reading in Revelations 1 and then we'll read from Jude 1 and then 1 Thessalonians 4 and so just remember the announcements that were made and the things look you know that there in the parents was saying make sure you wear clothes to the banquet somebody on the internet out there they wonder what in the world are we doing see not street clothes right and not work clothes right there you go you know at least one time you can dress up for your sweetheart right and come with you know at least dress clothes all right cuz that'll that'll be a good thing we always have a good time fellowshipping together you know and everything and U you know people will say well we shouldn't do this and we shouldn't do that and my wife and I talking yesterday a little bit about it that you know we uh we go everywhere's else right sure but we don't uh think about well we can rent a place and we can have only Believers being there that's right you know like we've done before with the kids you know uh we don't tell our kids to go out to the ska and rink you know and do with all of the world and everything else but we have it time just rented a place and took the kids ourself now is anything wrong with that that way they can do a few things and you know and do but we can sure go out and fellowship with the rest of the world but then we don't want to come and and uh just fellowship with Believers you know and know that it's just always been that way and always will be all right Revelation 1 Jude 1 1 Thessalonians 4 for Heavenly Father we thank you for your love and your grace unto us thank you for all things and we ask you that you would just guide us in your love and we know you give us all things freely so we can depend upon it and we commit everything into your hands this day that you would speak through our hearts and our lives that Lord we may see you and want to walk in the light of Your Love forgive our sins cuz that's the main thing keep us covered Lord let that seraphim with the the burner Lord to keep us clean may he do a work today in each one of our hearts and lives as the word is revealed it it would burn out all the things that would be in us that we may walk in you we love you and we thank you in Jesus name amen Revelations 1 1 the revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave unto him to show unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass and he said and signified it by his Angel unto his servant John who by record of the word of God and the testimony of Jesus Christ and of all things that he saw blessed is he that readeth and they that hear the words of this prophecy and keep those things which are written therein for the time is at hand I just turn back one page and you'll be right on Jude uh only has one chapter in verse n says Yet Michael the Archangel MH when contending with the devil he disputed about the body of Moses does not bring against him a railing accusation but said the Lord rebuked thee now he didn't argue with him right he didn't fuss with him you know he didn't you know we'll find out a little bit later that the reason why and we know you know the truth of it but let's go to uh 1 Thessalonians 4:16 very familiar for the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of the Archangel and with the Trump of God and the dead in Christ shall rise first you may be seated the Lord add his Blessing to the reading of the word now we've been quite some time speaking on these things and we want to uh you know do as the prophet said he said hold up something until the people see it and I would sure like to go on Into the Book of Revelations and all of that but uh you know we stay where we feel necessary until we finish the point and then so you can say well everybody here sees it but one well that's me I guess and that's the one we're waiting on it's for me to get it and then we can move on but U you know that's just the way but now we've covered how that there's many many different kinds of angels okay and it's not just a half a dozen of them Jesus could have prayed and it would have been 12 Legion of angels He called could have called for and that would have been at least 240,000 and then over in the Book of Revelation you find that there was four Ang Els controlling the other Angels which would be the demons Etc you know uh that fall that fell after Satan's line they was 200,000,000 which would be 200 million and that was what fell so they like about 400 million didn't fall well you know we could spend a lot of time talking about angels and not exhaust the uh point of what we're we're trying to get to but I'm want you to see that to become more conscious you know of the angels and their jobs their positions their their things that they're doing and one day the prophet said like this he said we get over there one day he said angel will be just as real as we are well see that's our Point we've always looked at angels as just being some kind of a spirit floating around well brother randam saw the angel that came to him and he said he looked like a man even described his height and his hair and his his garments that he was wearing and all and uh you know so why why worry on that I'm I'm trying to get us to see that they are things that they do that are related to you and I because according to Hebrews 1 and 14 1 14 1314 they're called ministering Spirits the angels of God who minister to unto the ARs of salvation all right they have something to do with you and I right Psalms what 34 and7 where it says that the angel singular and that has a reason for being that way because it takes all the angels to make the angel and brother Brandon will quote it most of the time Angels plural and and he's not correcting the scripture he's just showing that the scripture is right you know that there's Angels not just one Angel you know all right see then remember we went through it where brother brand said people will say well we don't need Angels today cuz we've got the Holy Spirit he said well Peter had one Paul had one well he had one and like I said he had he had the Holy Spirit brother randam had the holy spirit for a long time right but yet he couldn't preach the seals until he met an angel that told him those things so then that's you know and like I've emphasized on that why wasn't that this is the angel that was with him from the time that he was born why wouldn't just that angel be able to tell him right cuz there different jobs for different Angels wormwood was to destroy the world with water right well like I said then you think he just went off and sat down now he's got nothing to do so he just ping his thumbs and he just walking through Heaven he said my job's done you know no he's controlling the waters to keep them from destroying the world again because he said you know remember brother brand in the emphases he said wormwood said let me go down there and I'll put that fire out you know no no you control it you don't put it out all he had to do that W that thing would have been full of water you know and they' have been floating out but see the angels have their jobs to do but my problem is mine is at least and you listen to me talk about my own self that I'm always getting in the way yes where the angels of God want to run me to the Tree of Life see all right and I'm always getting in the way not allowing them to do their job okay and and that's where our problem is we say well each born again Christian has an angel well that's true but it's not just one it was not just one there with with Elijah and them you know they would just he said there's more for us than they are for them the Angels it says are in Psalms encampeth and that means to lay Siege or in other words to enclose to shut up it's got many different meanings but it it it it means that they're there and brother rown said they stay there he said they don't go and come they stay he said well he said the Holy Spirit had to go out yeah he said out on the limb so how far is that right but just remember on this just calling him back he's all right right so just keep in mind what we're trying to say all right now as I said angels have their jobs uh ministers are angels amen you know uh of church AG Messengers those are angels we went through investigating judgment angels all right and see we say well we don't believe in angels because we never seen them that's our problem I gave you where the prophet of God said the reason we don't see Angels is because we're not dedicated now that's the way he said it he said that angel appeared to him when he was fasting and praying so he gave you the key see it's not just something to where that we we say well we don't believe in it cuz that's where a lot of people is you know a lot of people think there reason that if they don't believe in something that means it don't exist everybody else in the world can believe in it and be right riding in a Cadillac down the highway and here's a guy sitting up in the mountain somewhere I don't believe in cars well you know what he thinks he thinks he's controlling the world but you know he's got a problem a he but you let him want a day to go to tangon and he'll you know the Amish and menites and the things you know they want to ride in the cars but you let them move from one place to another one and they don't drive their buggies 4,000 mies they put all their stuff in the things and you know they jump in and ride with them and and do things you know but that's where see we we we don't believe in things and we think they don't exist because we don't believe in them but now we were talking about even like cherubims and Sims and brother random covering how that the seraphim was the the burner right next to God to keep the worshipper clean you know and we gave the quotes where he was talking about the the uh the lips of of Isaiah and he was talking about even it dealing with you and I and our our new birth right because it something has to come and burn us out to get us clean for the Holy Ghost can come in well see they have a major things for them to do you know and and they're doing their job you say well why couldn't it just be the Holy Ghost well because God didn't do it that way you know I mean he didn't do it that way he didn't leave it to just be the Holy Ghost to do and this and that and the other now what have we been talking about all of those angels the prophet I gave it to you where he said they were in degrees right so they're all have their job y but one don't overpower and do the other right but it keeps gr Higher and Higher and Higher and Higher and Higher right on into the presence and and the prophet of God talking about Jesus Christ being the angel of the Covenant come on all right the Bible doesn't have any trouble talking about angels and and their doings but we're the ones that have our trouble because we don't believe in them because we never seen them you but see how many times have you entertained angels onw amen that's what the scripture says now but see we don't recognize it you know I've told you about the time I went in the basement of the church and the Baptist Church there and and undone the doors and things and everything was locked up and I got inside and walked downstairs and there was a man walking around he said well I just well okay it's all right I'm just telling the story and I talked to him a minute and said will I service in a little while he said I just checking things out and I got to go on down the road well he just went on out went up towards gains you know that was the way we went when we heard of this message we walked right out of that church and went right up that same road he was walking right you know so we entertain angels on aw that's right because we don't uh we don't believe they're real but that's what I'm trying my best to get you and I to believe in the Angels being real yes amen now we spent so much time on it I don't want to I we should go back and listen to the the messages prior you know and and and pay attention to what I'm trying to sayen but now we want to talk about archangels now there's only one mention of Archangels in the Bible and that's Michael now we'll get back to that in a little while but brother brandom calls Gabriel right an archangel now the Bible is not in the Bible to go and say Gabriel the archangel it's not written out in there so don't go try to find it so that's why we're glad to have a prophet now when I can't find it I believe he knew where it was at amen cuz he got it out of the Bible I don't believe he got it out of his own head well we need a couple more you know we can read Michael but we want to read one here about getting all I don't think he did I think he knew the Bible all right so then that way we can depend on what he had to say about it and all and and see it now don't get confused with today when I keep bringing out when go we'll go into Gabriel and don't get confused now I know the quotes where the Prophet said that Gabriel was a messenger to the Jews I agree with you 100% he was but your Prophet said that the one that announced the first coming would announce the second coming and I know that's to Israel amen but what about me and you okay we'll get to that later but brother brandom said on the message believest thou this that there were great angels and things and that archangels and he said now Gabriel right Gabriel had a job to do Gabriel was the announcing Angel he was the one to come to Daniel Daniel 8:16 9:21 on through into 121 and and all in the Book of Daniel and you'll find that related together with Michael all right and you'll see there that to show you what I'm trying to say that there has to be degrees and level right and uh you know uh you may have a guy that's working in the uh you know you got a shop and you may have a guy working in the shop he may be stronger than everybody else but he's not the guy that's running the printing press right he's the guy sweeping the floor but he's got his job so don't get into how big who's what and how strong what it just just forget all about it and just you know just listen a little bit and let's talk about it because Gabriel was coming to Daniel but he was hindered there if you'll read your scripture for 21 days yep by the Prince of Persia which was Satan right now and he says your prince he calls him the great Prince and all he he said Michael came to my Aid yep but see Gabriel then couldn't defeat Satan right so there wouldn't be an angel under Gabriel anywhere all the way down to what the Angels would be would not be capable of defeating Satan right is that sensible sure because he said he said Michael came to my Aid and and and he was there with it see all right now Gabriel as I said is the announcing Angel he come to tell Daniel of the future of Israel see all right he came to Zacharias in uh Luke 1 and he told him about John the Baptist that was going to come all right you know Elizabeth and and all and she'd conceived and you remember Zacharias is about like me and you and he he said well what kind of a sign do I have of it he said okay you don't believe me so you just won't be able to speak till the baby gets here you know that's what happened that's right y you know that when he first opened his mouth he was able to tell him what the name the child that's right you know John which it should have been Zacharias or something like that the prophet said but he was able to tell you know what the name would be all right now remember that the angel Gabriel looked to connection I want you to follow this especially into the afternoon message all right that Gabriel would tell uh Zacharias what the name his son so it's more than just to deliver a message it has a lot more to do with it he appears also to Mary in telling her that she will conceive and have a child and who it'll be Etc and that was his denouncing of the first coming of of Jesus Christ and he even tells Mary what to name the child but now remember he's an angel all right y he was told her to name him Jesus right but that didn't make Elizabeth you know John to J Jump in the wound of Elizabeth because Gabriel said it but when Mary a human being said the name Jesus then John received the Holy Ghost in his mother's womb see now that ties down to earth and we ought to realize that and we'll get back to that more as we go along but just keep those things in mind see Gabriel then he had a special job he was to announce like a great event like Israel and all of their Journeys and all their things he made known to uh Daniel all of the things that would transpire then he announced you know the great coming of the person to Zacharias of John the Baptist and and then he would announce to to Mary about the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ now I wrote it like this I'll cover more in detail probably this afternoon all right but I want to jump over and just just I wanted that in your mind because Gabriel could not handle Satan right for 21 days he was hindered I know the biggest portion of that hindrance was in the mind of of Daniel sure you know sure but that's still he couldn't handle the situation right he had to have help to come well you know the Angels don't worry about hollering for help when they need it but sometimes we don't want to we think we can make it on our own but now just remember what I've been trying to get you to see that the angels of God are sent to minister only to the Airs of Salvation we don't believe in little Gloria sitting over in the manger scene you know it couldn't be decent enough to put a man Angel there because we don't believe in female angels and things are but see each one has his job the seraphim he keeps the work worshiper clean right the cherim and brother R said the word is interchangeable in other words he used it as the sign but if you'll go back and study it we will more this evening but if you'll go back and do it brother brandom would use cherubim and serim as the same Angel but then he would def divide their jobs throughout the Bible like in the Old Testament it wasn't a cherubim that was made you know the the S seraphim excuse me wasn't that made it was cherubims that were made and placed over the altar right uh you know and in Ezekiel you'll find see because seraphim is only used two times and that's in Isaiah 6 whereas cherubim is used a whole lot more and and related to it and but just take your Chim sometimes and relate his job and you'll find it has something to do down here right whereas the seraphim is keeping us clean in heaven yeah the worshiper clean all right so they got their own job all right I just want to make sure you follow that I'm not trying to talk about just Angels Etc I'm trying to get you and I to see how they actually are for the erors of Salvation so then just keep that in mind all right now Moses as the said made cherubims Ezekiel Saw cherubims You remember what brother rown described Ezekiel when he talks about the wheel in the middle of the wheel and how that they had four faces and had this and that and the other and he comes all the way down to the church ages and it comes all the way down so then you'll see cherubims have the dealing with more or less the Earthly form right of what we're doing but keep that in mind but now let's get on this Archangel and and get off of that what's the order of their work that they do now I I've always said this if I owned a company and the kids you know they came along well they would start cleaning the bathroom and cleaning the floor but now where do you see a CEO or a president doing something like that now I just wouldn't have one if I had a company my CEO or my my plant manager he better know how many bathrooms there are in there and whether there toilet paper in them or not he said well that ain't his job why not he's in charge of everything I used to work there at dville and and we had 40s something uh employees well you know on that line the group we were in with brother dick KN you know well lot even brother dick now he was good but he didn't know the 40something jobs brother Al he didn't know the 40something jobs but you know what I was out to replacement I had to know all 46 of them me we had I had to be able to go get them and go to work on them without being trained even if I had run them in a year all right my point is what I'm saying watch the order coming downward or going upward either way you want to make it because even like the burners you remember when when Jacob laid down head on the Rock looked up there was Angel ascending and descend sending they were carrying up his prayers and his doings and all and bringing back things to him all right look at it as them doing that for us amen and then you won't be just say well that's the Holy Ghost well see that's what we doing so you say well why do we need to know it's all about God it's just God well who is your god what is your God's name all right see we need to know a lot of things don't we amen all right let's get down to it now Gabriel is used to announce but whereas Michael according to Daniel you want to read it you know Daniel 8 and Daniel 9 and then Daniel 12 you'll be dealing with Michael because now remember even though Gabriel announces to Israel Michael must come on the scene all right and just like it is in the Book of Revelations because you remember we're showing you how the whole Bible was written that in the Book of Revelations the reason we keep reading that the Revelation that God give to Jesus to give to John S and signified it by an Angel all right but that angel you see that angel as a delivering Angel to speak to John but about two verses later you find it in red letter you see that Christ come on the scene right right whatever we try to deliver to you if Christ don't come on the scene hey we've done missed it anyway you know if Christ don't come on the scene and take you and I out of here then what we believe is wrong right I said what we believe is wrong I didn't say the message was wrong right I said what we believe because see our believing of the message could make us miss it amen of what we believe well it's not important to know we just need to know about Jesus that's exactly what I'm talking about what the world say that's what I'm trying my best to get you to see even though Daniel would be able to come and tell I mean Gabriel to Daniel and tell him even of the 70 weeks of Daniel but things like that and I'll go ahead and say it for many weeks down even though the angel of God could be able to come to brother randam and tell him what the seals were he couldn't reveal it right right and you show me where he said you could cuz he said only the Holy Ghost is the Holy Ghost the only revealer of the word amen you know you going to make him the Holy Ghost see you're going to mess up all right so what was the job that Michael is to do all right Michael his major work is to defeat Satan okay he was defeat Satan the great Archangel yep okay that's where I've always said that we're not looking at it in the correct order and we'll get to it in the minut about Michael being Christ but you see Michael brother random said that he wasn't a man right he was an angel h see now I hope this will unlock our minds as to when you're when you say Michael is Christ your mind is saying to you Jesus is Michael now unlock it that's right because you have no way of saying that no amen Jesus wasn't Michael right Michael is Christen right okay so unlock your mind think with me yeah but it's just Jesus see that's what I'm saying that's where the two Soul people was they said brother R said the soul is the nature of the spirit and they said ah the soul is just the nature of the spirit see they added the word to it right it's made it nothing you just the nature of the spirit it's just just no it's the real you amen you see all we got to do is take one word add it or take it away right all right now what was Michael's job to do in the Book of Daniel you'll find him coming on the scene right and he is actually fighting for Gabriel to where Gabriel is loose to go on down to Daniel I read it Daniel says you're Prince Right the great Prince over in in Michael 12 I mean Daniel 121 it says the great Prince Michael will stand up and fight and Michael will stand up in the end time and fight for Israel we know that's true H see in other words he's the one that can defeat Satan y amen and I've always said it this way to you and how many remembers it for how many years 40 that I said this that when God was standing there and Satan being his right-hand man now brother ROM says that he was his right-and man you know Satan the anointed Church y well he can see all these angels coming out but he can't understand what happened when that little Halo of light came out and walked around and begin to say Let There Be and remember that was Michael right amen CU Michael's Christ you said well I don't know where I agree with you or not well okay I gave you some quotes to where you would see what I'm talking about but we go over we don't have to read it Revelations 12 1-9 you'll find that Michael cast Lucifer Satan Out of Heaven all right now that's a twofold right and brother Ram said and I can be glad to find you these I might have put it in there but surely you order to know it he said that was back in the beginning when Michael cast Satan out all right now but it also has to be in a fold in you and I amen right and then it must be in a point to Israel Amen in the tribulation after we leave out of here because he's going to have to deal with that and see that's why people are say well we just we got the Holy Ghost they get the Angels well I'm sure we need every bit of the help we get that's right I can get right all right cuz the battle didn't start on Earth cuz sin even didn't originate on Earth greatest battle ever fought it began in heaven when Michael and his angels fought with Lucifer and his angels what kind of a battle that was I have no comprehensions and don't even try to consider it right I don't think they were karate experts you know and the other people wouldn't and this that the other and you know a great big battle you know punching around and no right these brothers it was in karate you're supposed to never fight your mentor that's an honor but how many do it everybody wanted to whip the guy that wanted to whip them or somebody else right but you see it's supposed to been an honor you're supposed to bow out to your Mentor because he taught you and a good Mentor is just like a good preacher he never tells you at one time all he knows right I talked to Brother Gary there the other day about some something that I've spoke about but how it preached on you never let out everything because why it's not that people get so way ahead of you but they just don't understand you right they don't understand you right you got to come to way that you understand all right so now Michael's job is to fight or defeat Satan right that's his job he's got a position there and he does that job sin originated are said in heaven but Gabriel couldn't cast him out y it took Michael now who is this great Archangel who is this great one that he didn't even argue with the devil over in the book of Jude right he just says get out of here Michael knew what happened to the body of Moses and brother randam says I gave you one where he said he went in Rapture you brother R said frankly I don't think Moses died he said I think he just stepped on the rock well the Bible says he did but that's I believe what brother randam said don't you he ain't correcting it he died in the extent he left this Dimension right he left this realm that we're in and he stepped out in a Rapture and he just went on off right and when Satan wanted to know about it he knew the one guy that he could try to talk to about it was Michael Michael said I ain't even going to talk to you and boy you know that tore the devil up MH right you know we used to have a brother here and I'm not throwing off on we had a brother here that that all you had to do is just say uh you know like man that used to work down there dville all he had to do was you go up to him and say you're not feeling too good and you know with a couple hours he's gone home why because he took that power of suggestion you know and it kept working and kept working with him so Michael knew not even to allow Satan to even have any pirate suggestion he just says get out of here just go on but you know you can't never figure out the part of a angels and things cuz they're like humans in the express of this I told you about it we we had a boy at dark gills he had a 57 chevret and this other guy had a Pontiac and that boy that 5 said chevret wanted a drag race every week and that old Pontiac could just go just run off leaving the boy in the Chevrolet would go and he would rebuild cators and put on brand new cators and four four barrels and two four barrels and man he's fixed the transmission he done everything he' pull up side that old boy and he said I want to try you again he just just run off and leave him he spending on tell him what back then trying to outdo him right wonder what he order done it went and bought him a Pontiac you know right but see he didn't have that much sense and that's the way the human element is and I believe that's the way the Angels work I believe Angels work in a degree that like brother Brandon says if he can't get you for drinking what did he do he said he'll get you smoking all right so there's a drinking Angel you know there's a smoking angel yeah and it was amazing cuz I've never really seen that and I found about three or four of them gave it to you where brother Ram called the angel that come to him a healing Angel right I've never seen it he called him the healing Angel H see they got a job to do right but our problem is is when we won't do our jobs we won't do everybody else's job you know just doing our job h and let everything work in order and the whole thing goes all the way through but see I'm trying to get a point there Satan could not defeat Michael now what kind of a special angel or or being was that that Satan couldn't defeat the only one I know that Satan can't defeat is almighty God right so we're getting closer and closer together to what we're talking about right that Satan he don't understand I gave you a couple of quotes there beginning and end of the Gentile Gentile dispensation number seven on your note brother says Michael was Christ he saids on paragraph or page 78 Christ of mystery number8 on You not Christ of mystery 1963 728 I think he said Michael Christ he said Satan tried to have a better Kingdom than Michael than Christ all right now let's talk a little bit if Michael is Christ now remember the statement I made a moment ago brother random doesn't say Michael is Jesus right that's a human element right Earthly person being right now and brother Ram if you'll run the references I gave them to you he'll call the Angels persons beings see we look at them as like Spirits no they're beings but they're not human beings right and Michael being Christ wouldn't be counted a human being but he would be Christ right right now who's Christ I gave you number nine on your notes he said Michael is not a man yep he's an angel so we not talking about about Jesus right right he's talking about Christ right Michael is Christ okay so your mind should be unlocked enough to stay away from the fact of saying that Michael is Jesus no brother R doesn't say that right he says Michael is Christ right amen now who's Christ now brother randam says number 10 Pillar of Fire Christ is the lost that went out of God all right the message number 11 my angel my angel shall go before thee Christ is the Loos how many do you need Christ the Loos that went out of God show us the father 1953 Christ the logos that went out of God El Shad 1959 Christ the Loos now let's read that last one and then let's just read it where they asked brother brand the question okay number 14 which would be the last one of you notes this is questions and answers 1964 8830 paragraph 11:58 brother random what is the difference if any between the angel of the Lord and the Lord himself the angel of the Lord is a messenger from the Lord and the Lord himself is that person okay now he's explaining it right not the person of the Angel the angel from the Lord let me show you Earthly speaking he must have laid something up and done some here's an angel from the Lord Earthly speaking here's an angel from the Lord Earthly speaking here is an angel from the Lord how do we know then that they are angels from the Lord how do you know whether an angel is talking to you and telling you what's right or not whether it be a preacher whether it be a church age messenger or whether it be anything that you see how do you know y That's he tells you when they bring the word of the Lord but when they try to pervert it it's not from the Lord then try to make it say something that doesn't say just say whatever then there's a supernatural Angel comes down from the Lord a messenger like Gabriel and Michael and wormwood and so forth their names all right and brother random what are you telling us the angels of the Lord are not the Lord right it's an angel from the Lord all right so Michael is Christ Christ was the logos the pillar of fire the Halo Etc that we've been on for a while that came out from God that was a part of God right so we're going to have to deal a little bit with Michael being Christ instead of just saying he's an angel but I like the way the prophet said that he said he's not a man right he's an angel Michael is Christ Christ is the creator of God y That's why it said all things were made by him and without him is not anything made that was Jesus Christ right right see when you say Jesus Christ you're not referring to the human element Jesus right like I said Gabriel brings the message to Mary and brings a message to Zacharias of even the name of the person that's going to be born right now that's how great those angels stand but Michael is greater cuz he's Christ right but R doesn't call Gabriel Christ he calls Michael Christ Satan could never figure that out I said he knows that he was made the right-hand man with a right-and man supposed to be second in command he come to find out that a part of God went out which was the logos the word the Christ the son of God theophany all of those words and he began to create and Satan can't handle him right why because it's not just a regular Angel it's Christ amen and brother R said Christ is the Angel of the Covenant now he never said Jesus Jesus is the Angel of the Covenant he said Christ now he'll say I'll make sure you understand me or you won't think I'm running it all he'll say Jesus Christ is the Angel of the Covenant yeah cuz that's true amen Jesus Christ because Jesus is the name of almighty God right right right that's the only name God ever had that is his name Jesus but see that name was delivered by Gabriel but now where do we get this afternoon on something to move into the message a little further to where we can look at it and see what has really taken place even in our day amen y I do not believe brother brandom was Christ I do not believe brother brandom was Michael I do not believe none of that now right but he was the anointed right Amen in the basis of saying Christ that way but not the Christ he said if you do that he said you messing me up but it's better to say that he's God than it is to say he's the devil right amen that's closer he's closer to being God than he is being you to call him the devil so we have to get it in the right place but you understand what I'm saying yes I just want this point to you Christ come out from God in the beginning right and that was Michael see we've dealt with it being Christ and we've preached on it many many sermons about Christ and how that a part of God went out brother R said now you know it's not part like a part it's like a spoonful out of the ocean being the same as the rest of the ocean all right so then when that part of God went out that was Christ amen Christ didn't become Michael that was who was able to defeat Satan No Angel can defeat him cuz he's a second in command I hope you're listening Gabriel couldn't do it but look at all the things Gabriel has done and look what's happening wormwood couldn't do it those angels couldn't do it they couldn't defeat Satan right but Michael could because see then Michael would be Christ which would be God in another form right amen right call an angel why is there any problem with brother brandom saying that Jesus Christ is the Angel of the C why is there any problem in the book of Acts about what is it seven or whatever the book of Acts where it talks about that Jesus Christ was in the burning bush y who was that that spoke to Moses in the burning bush Jesus Christ amen and not Jesus the flesh right no like I said when we say son of God we think of it being 2,000 years ago when Son of God was the first form of coming out from God because anytime that you take that spoon full of water out it's got to be the same Essence chemical and thought as what you have in the whole ocean and all you're doing is giving a job or a way or something for that to be done right so Michael then is Christ went over in Jamaica and preached that years ago and I thought they'd wrote a song Come find out they'd been singing it for 20 years one this people used to sing that song Michael on your side and I thought they wrote a song while I was preaching you about Michael and I was having a rejoicing time like they was and you know come find out they've been singing that song they had it wrote down you know but it was good Michael on your side who do you want on your side that's right well what do you mean brother Dale I've got Christ which which is the Holy Ghost that's in me what do you need angels for then if that's the way you're going so you're not seeing that all of those angels that didn't fall are under complete control of the Holy Spirit I said that from day one now mhm right all of those angels are under complete control and as I said a while ago if I had a company my kids would start cleaning the bathroom and when they wound up being president or vice president or whatever it was you could go in and ask them said how many bathrooms we got in this place they said come on I'll show you where they're at why because they would know then what to be done right right right what is it in the the president of United States what is it is V president vice president and then who is the speaker of the house is number three see if something happens to these two the Speaker of the House automatically becomes president why cuz they're supposed to know right y right right those people up there see that's where the trouble's at I'm not against Obama I'm not against anybody I don't have no problems with anybody but when you elect a guy that don't even know how to do nothing and then you put him in there as president and he turned around and said what I do I mean honestly come on that's what he done he didn't know what to do he doesn't know what to do now amen right that's right the president of the United States should have to come from the bathroom cleaning all the way up through the House and Senate before he's ever elected right right where he'd know something about what's going on right I'm not a politician I don't care right cuz it wouldn't matter like brother brandham said you put George was and Abraham Lincoln never office in the country it wouldn't pull it out they going to change nothing that's right you see right well why wouldn't you want a company brother Donnie and I were talking the other day about why wouldn't you want a company where everybody in the company was Christians oh absolutely really CHR amen now if you couldn't trust them they're not Christians okay you said we can't hire 50 people why not if they're Christian you mean you come in church here and my wife will go to town with her pocketbook and she holds it real close well if I a crook I'd tap her on the shoulder and snatch it out of the other side and run with cuz she's holding it so tight cuz she'd loosen it up you but you see why couldn't we as Christians set our pocketbook down here just leave and S up here right why would we be worried if we were Christians that's right now it wouldn't take long to find out who was a Christian and who wasn't amen like brother Donnie told him before he came up here he don't know him and his dadd and his daddy used to talk and Donnie said you send them Big Fellas over there and let me handle them just a little bit I'll tell you whether they're Christians or not you know why cuz they all come over there I'm Pastor so and so Church how about fixing my car for nothing oh my right oh my you understand no he found out brother Dale don't do that away amen that's right by the way re L you you got to write him a check okay I'm think of that but listen folks that's not a joke I just happen to think of but listen listen Michael is Christ amen and Christ is the Son of God Amen the part of God that went out that later brother Brandon said became flesh that's it right there upon Earth the crash that Son of God that come out back there came all the way down through the Bible right amen now I'll say something but I'm not going to preach on it till later and you can't find the soul of God in the Old Testament I ain't saying no more that's right I've said that to you hundreds of times across this pull pit one of these days I'll preach on it amen you can find Christ all the way through right right we'll find out one of these days Satan was what was it he would upset in heaven cuz he could not have a greater Kingdom that's what he wanted right a greater Kingdom y than Michael y amen once he saw who was in command he knew he couldn't defeat him that's right so he backed off and wanted to set up a kingdom that he wanted to try to keep getting more and more amen right and Satan today that's why he still don't think he still thinks as I said want to go about to the chevet and P Satan still thinks today that he can defeat you and me and you know as long as we don't yield to Christ he can he's already got us defeated but if we get Christ on our side then you don't have to worry about him why do you pray over your food that's right well bless God it don't matter I just go eat it anyway why why don't you pray over your food that's right yes sir cuz you want Christ on your side are you listening Christ is the logos that went out of God the Son of God and Michael is Christ he's not a man no he's an anointing of Christ right amen the highest of all right is Christ that's the one I want on my side what about you come on Brother come on end it right there cuz that's as far I'm not going into this evening's message cuz if I get into it we would be here midnight but just remember there is an archangel right if you notice I didn't mention Thessalonians but he is tied to that because there's only one Archangel right listed in the Bible come on and that's Michael and it says the Lord is say shall descend from heaven with a shout voice of an archangel and TR we get back to that we just go a little bit at to time amen and just give you enough to make you up your curiosity let me say it like this where you'll think about it but ROM said Gabriel announced the first coming of Jesus Christ and Gabriel will announce the second coming so we got to get back to Gabriel now God wanted us to go to Christ because he is the great Archangel amen and if what we talk about if Gabriel doesn't line up with Christ we've missed it right amen true let's stand together what do you think about it Michael is Christ who do you want on your side fighting for you he said well I'm going to go out here and hire me a couple of bodyguards no I I want to kind of see what they look like and their actions and things I want to know you know I don't want to be like Brother Dean was telling about that guy coming down the line you know where they was getting together to have a fight and the Man all the way down through there was trying to tell Brother Dean how many people he whipped what was he trying to do scure him well they stepped out on the ring he hit him one time and he's gone see that I don't want a guy with a mouth I want somebody can back up what they're doing right you know amen go ahead brother 539 anybody have a e now only got through 20 minutes early so we can sing a little bit all right I generally take a whole lot and don't get to sing so let's sing and worship Who Is It Michael on your side Michael is Christ and Christ is the Son of God the Loos go ahead cre in me a clean heart let that serve him Lord let it burn me out cre in mean oh God and renew a right Spirit Within Me cast me not away from th holy me that Christ come the of let him come Lord let him manifest yourself Among Us me clean heart oh God and renew right Spirit Within Me cre in me a clean heart oh God let those angels do their job let don't hinder them away from take not th Holy Spirit from me you believe itto me David he didn't have any he said th salvation you just think of those Old Testament people when those angels would come to them and they would go out and Conquer a whole Army who was that the angels of God the prophet said there's more angels in the New Testament than there was in the old see really we are the ARs of Salvation they're only under the basis of what's going to be given unto us we are in the Kingdom look out there now look at the beautiful kingdom that Satan is making oh wonderful beautiful churches multi-million dollar buildings what are they going to do when the money keeps titing them down oh of course they're going to push for money just think about it look what's been revealed to You and I by a prophet look what's been made to you unknown to you and I about a prophet see even though that Prophet can make it known he cannot reveal it but neither can the Holy Spirit reveal it if the prophet don't make it know why would be you're afraid of anything in the prophet me God is send us a message why can't we depend on it well that's your idea and I got my idea that's not in the Bible come and show me where I missed it but now you'll go talk to everybody else remember that's not a good Christian to go talk to everybody else about whether I've missed it or not a Christian's supposed to come to the person and tell the person they missed it Jesus and your life will never be come and let's believe oh one way our brother's having problems with his legs and his back and everything you have had troubles sympathize and Believe In Father in the name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ
