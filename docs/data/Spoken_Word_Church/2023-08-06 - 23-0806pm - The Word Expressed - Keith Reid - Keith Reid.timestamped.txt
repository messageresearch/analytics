[34:30] of the inheritance of the Saints in
[34:33] light amen
[34:35] who has delivered us from the power of
[34:38] Darkness
[34:39] and has translated us into the kingdom
[34:42] of his dear son
[34:44] in whom we have Redemption to his blood
[34:47] the Forgiveness of sins
[34:50] who is the image of the invisible God
[34:54] the firstborn of every creature for by
[34:57] him were all things created that are in
[35:00] heaven
[35:01] and that are in Earth visible and
[35:04] invisible
[35:06] whether they be Thrones or dominions or
[35:09] principalities or powers
[35:11] all things were created by Him and for
[35:15] him
[35:16] and it is before all things and by him
[35:19] all things consist
[35:21] and he is the head of the body the
[35:24] church
[35:25] which is the beginning the firstborn
[35:27] from the dead
[35:28] that in all things he might have
[35:31] preeminence may the Lord that is
[35:34] blessing to the reading of the word you
[35:35] may be seated
[35:38] laughs
[35:39] it works is fate expressed 1965
[35:43] paragraph 106.
[35:46] but Brahm said
[35:48] a Baptist Minister told me not long ago
[35:51] he said
[35:53] I just contact step revelation
[35:56] I said then you cannot accept the Bible
[36:00] you cannot accept Christ because he is a
[36:04] revelation of God Amen is God's reveal
[36:08] in flesh simply
[36:10] therefore the whole church is built upon
[36:15] divine revelation amen praise God you
[36:20] know we look at ourselves as a Triune
[36:24] being
[36:25] where Body Spirit and soul
[36:29] and let us look at it like this this
[36:31] evening you know what we say this
[36:34] morning well this flesh man is an
[36:37] unbeliever
[36:39] is a non-believer your spirit
[36:43] is a make-believer
[36:45] and your soul is a real believer
[36:48] because when you receive the new birth
[36:52] it is your soul
[36:54] that is transformed
[36:56] and the reason why we're still here is
[37:00] because this man this house needs
[37:03] Redemption amen
[37:06] so when you receive the new birth your
[37:08] soul is redeemed amen amen but this
[37:12] needs Redemption and the problem you
[37:15] have is in this flesh man and in your
[37:19] spirit
[37:20] you know saying Church the smile is this
[37:23] Pride there's Envy there's all these
[37:25] things really that is the nature of your
[37:28] spirit that one morning you wake up and
[37:31] you you love one another
[37:33] and you feel loved and the next day the
[37:37] devil tell you nobody loves you so your
[37:40] spirit is a make-believer sometimes he
[37:42] believes and and so there is a
[37:44] suppression because of where you live
[37:47] amen the holy spirit is working on you
[37:51] to bring you to the image of Christ amen
[37:55] but the the attitude or the pressure of
[37:58] this manner the ottoman the oath you
[38:00] live in is causing you Amen to take the
[38:04] influences of the world so you you look
[38:07] at the neighbor's car and not only that
[38:10] you like it you wish it was yours that's
[38:13] Envy amen does that make you a believer
[38:17] but but let us look at them of Allah
[38:19] Peter the man with the key that unlocked
[38:22] the door
[38:23] Paul the Apostle says that Peter when
[38:26] the Jews was around he separated himself
[38:28] from the Gentiles
[38:30] but then when there was no Gentiles
[38:32] looking he eaten and all of that with
[38:35] the with the Gentiles and Paul said to
[38:38] him he rebuked him and said Peter you
[38:40] are to be blamed so though even with the
[38:43] new birth
[38:45] Peter had trouble in his emotions really
[38:48] amen because of that Spirit but so so
[38:52] your body is an unbeliever amen but
[38:56] listen when you receive the new birth
[38:58] that body is Justified
[39:00] amen hallelujah and what he wants for
[39:06] his confidence is a first pull
[39:09] he feels he see that's where he lives
[39:12] but your spirit is a make-believer
[39:15] and if that Spirit of Euros be
[39:18] Sanctified by the word amen you see when
[39:23] Jesus made the woman of Samaria it did
[39:26] not operate with her flesh
[39:28] she was not sick amen but she needed
[39:32] sanctification the second pull amen
[39:36] believe if she could believe
[39:39] but the soul is a Believer he's received
[39:43] the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the
[39:45] third pull is operating in him so he
[39:49] knows amen hallelujah so
[39:54] we now look at take that note to the
[39:58] Eternal one
[39:59] no Jesus when he was here on Earth
[40:02] you know it comes from the Eternal Word
[40:06] and he comes into theophany in the
[40:10] theophany you know all things and from
[40:13] theophany he comes to the Virgin born
[40:17] body amen no in his debt what happened
[40:22] amen Jesus in his debt he was going back
[40:26] from where he come from I come from God
[40:28] and I'm going back to God is that right
[40:31] amen so in debt Hallelujah you know
[40:34] while the body was in the grave where
[40:37] was his spirit
[40:39] he went and preached to the spirits that
[40:41] were in prison is that right
[40:44] amen so when you die I want to say this
[40:49] to you that for your confidence and when
[40:52] somebody dies they don't go in a space
[40:55] of absence
[40:57] this body goes to corruption amen but
[41:01] there's a part of you that's alive in
[41:04] another dimension
[41:06] and that is why if you have ever hear
[41:09] the testimony of somebody that has died
[41:12] and was raised from the dead they go
[41:15] into a sphere
[41:17] where it is Sublime
[41:21] it's perfect amen and right there they
[41:25] realize that this that we are in now is
[41:28] worse than where we're going to amen
[41:31] that's why our brother Dixon he said
[41:34] brother Keith I never want to come back
[41:36] amen but I hear your voice when you call
[41:39] me and I come back into that body wow
[41:41] amen but you ask the question how could
[41:45] I live in that for so long for all these
[41:48] years in this corruptible world Amen so
[41:52] as a Believer even dead take us back
[41:55] into the presence of God
[41:56] Amen Hallelujah we come from God yes
[42:01] amen we come from the word
[42:04] we bypass our theophany and come into
[42:08] flesh to be tested amen but if you die
[42:12] you step into that theophany house amen
[42:15] Paul said in second our Corinthians 5 21
[42:19] if my Earthly house and the Tabernacle
[42:21] is dissolved we have a Tiffany that is
[42:24] waiting high up in the heavens and it's
[42:27] not made with hands so in this we are
[42:29] groaning we're under pressure the
[42:33] pressures of this world is upon us
[42:34] waiting to be clothed upon you with a
[42:38] horse that is in heaven amen praise God
[42:42] now in the first seal paragraph one 12
[42:46] brother Graham said he said no Christ is
[42:49] a revelation of God
[42:52] in other words it brings God in plain
[42:54] view
[42:55] he came to reveal God because he and God
[42:59] were the same God was in Christ
[43:02] reconciling the world to himself in
[43:06] otherwise you never know just what God
[43:08] was until he revealed himself through
[43:12] Christ then you can see you know I
[43:16] remember the days when I used to get a
[43:17] publication from Brother Dale Ketch of
[43:20] uh there were reports from Israel on a
[43:23] daily basis and when the Israel is right
[43:26] about god Jehovah when they write the
[43:30] word god they write G underscore D
[43:34] because they realize that what we say
[43:38] God we we don't even understand what
[43:40] we're saying but when they speak of God
[43:42] they speak of the Eternal one the
[43:45] eternal spirit and because there's no
[43:47] concept not even to write the word they
[43:51] don't write it like that because it
[43:53] would not be the expression of who he is
[43:56] that is why Jesus the Lord Jesus is our
[44:01] only concept of God
[44:05] when the Jehovah's Witness go around and
[44:07] oh Jehovah Jehovah they don't even know
[44:09] what they're talking about
[44:10] amen praise God so here now the prophet
[44:15] was coming up to bring to you the
[44:17] seventh seal
[44:19] and in Christ the minister of God
[44:20] revealed 101 he says now for a text I
[44:24] want to take out of there
[44:26] for this this Vortex basing it up on the
[44:31] entire Bible
[44:33] he said but I want us to title this
[44:36] Christ is a mystery of God revealed
[44:40] he said Christ be Christ being the
[44:43] mystery of God revealed so the God we
[44:48] speak of it is the Lord Jesus Christ
[44:51] amen and our concept can't go further
[44:55] than that because he is the one now in
[44:57] Christ the minister of God revealed
[44:59] paragraph 141 he said now the first
[45:01] thing was that God wanted to reveal
[45:04] himself to the people
[45:06] he couldn't do it as a great Jehovah God
[45:10] will cover all space Time and Eternity
[45:12] he could not it's too great to ever be
[45:16] revealed to people because it would be
[45:20] too mysterious
[45:22] how could that great being that never
[45:25] did begin he said that after you you
[45:29] went beyond the cycle of a hundreds of
[45:32] billions and trillions and trillions of
[45:34] here of light here space and on out into
[45:37] an infinite he said into the eternity
[45:40] and a great creature that was all that
[45:45] and still is but what he wanted to do
[45:49] he loved fatherhood
[45:52] for he was a father and the only way
[45:55] that he could express it was to become a
[45:59] son of man
[46:01] that's the reason Jesus kept saying this
[46:04] son of man see they didn't know what he
[46:08] was talking about many of them but now
[46:11] we get it now we get it the son of man
[46:16] they didn't know what he was talking
[46:17] about many of them but now we get it he
[46:21] says he wanted to express himself
[46:25] that was is one of the greatest truthful
[46:28] purpose was to express himself identify
[46:33] himself with human being to be to reveal
[46:37] himself in Christ
[46:39] amen and so that's the greatest you will
[46:43] get of the Eternal God he said secondly
[46:47] to have the preeminence in his body of
[46:50] Believers that is his bride that he
[46:54] might live in his people he could do
[46:57] that he couldn't do that he could do
[47:00] that in Adam and Eve but sin separated
[47:02] them from that and so in the beginning
[47:04] that's exactly what God wanted to
[47:07] achieve yes
[47:09] what God is bringing you into now is
[47:12] what he wanted to achieve in Genesis
[47:15] but sinmar that picture but God is going
[47:19] to achieve what he set out to do how is
[47:22] he doing it here you are amen
[47:25] amen amen praise God now sometimes
[47:29] people miss the picture sometimes by a
[47:31] quote or something that was said you
[47:33] know so really now let us always
[47:36] remember that brother Branham was a son
[47:38] of man he was a prophet
[47:40] but it was a prophet revealing the son
[47:43] of man Jesus Christ Jesus was the
[47:46] prophet of all Prophets
[47:48] amen
[47:49] no they also use an expression they said
[47:53] well the the the message and the
[47:57] messenger becomes one
[47:59] that's fine if you've got a clear
[48:01] understanding
[48:02] but the message is Jesus Christ
[48:06] all right and you cannot make a son of
[48:10] man Jesus Christ
[48:12] Moses brother Benham said when he had
[48:14] the word of God to declare to the people
[48:16] it was more than Moses but when the word
[48:20] was declared it was Moses again amen
[48:24] hallelujah so don't take the prophetic
[48:27] for Runner more than a prophet he was
[48:32] not dated and if there's ever going to
[48:34] be any deity the closest you'll ever get
[48:38] to deity is the bride of Christ being
[48:40] revealed by the word of God
[48:43] don't put it on him put it on her
[48:47] you're with me
[48:49] Hallelujah because the bride is not
[48:52] married to a son of man she's married to
[48:57] the son of man and the two has become
[49:00] one
[49:01] amen hallelujah praise God so in my mind
[49:06] for clarity I always remind myself but
[49:10] he is my elieza
[49:13] amen and what was the minister of elieza
[49:16] is to find a bride for Isaac amen it was
[49:21] to find a bride for himself amen so
[49:25] we've got to be careful of the idols of
[49:28] our relics and all that we keep because
[49:31] the reflection is Jesus Christ
[49:34] amen the word expression becoming
[49:37] material if the expression is Christ
[49:41] then the material is Christ
[49:45] amen
[49:46] so if there's any data we're talking
[49:48] about it's not in Jeffersonville it's in
[49:52] you
[49:57] amen
[49:58] Christ the fullness of the god that
[50:01] bodily but you are coming into that
[50:04] fullness amen
[50:06] and Brethren let's hold this really
[50:10] that God is bringing you to a position
[50:13] for a body change
[50:16] and all that fulfilled God's purpose is
[50:20] going to have that change
[50:22] brother brother teaches years back he
[50:26] said and if you ain't got the Fate to
[50:28] make the change then you've got to go by
[50:31] the grave
[50:32] is it right
[50:34] like when they left Egypt remember they
[50:36] said we will not leave a hoof
[50:39] back in Egypt
[50:42] amen thing that belongs to us is coming
[50:45] out
[50:46] loud and in this Exodus everything that
[50:50] has the Seal of God is going to come out
[50:53] there is nothing the devil can do to
[50:57] stop you from making it
[51:00] the church might not want you yeah they
[51:04] might not accept you but God will accept
[51:07] you
[51:10] last week I was preaching I said you
[51:13] know the woman with the alabaster box of
[51:16] ointment
[51:17] I said many of us wouldn't want her in
[51:19] our church
[51:21] because they said she was a woman of the
[51:23] city
[51:24] and she was a sinner
[51:27] and we wouldn't want that woman in our
[51:29] church but Jesus
[51:32] Jesus said wherever the gospel is
[51:35] preached there's going to be mention of
[51:38] this woman
[51:40] right if there's not a sinner there's no
[51:43] need for a savior
[51:47] you can put you he can't push you when
[51:50] God can't reach you
[51:52] [Applause]
[51:56] amen
[51:58] the Bible says
[52:00] he had need to go through Samaria
[52:04] not because the priest was in Samaria
[52:07] but because a woman was in Samaria
[52:11] hello
[52:12] they said a pastor who do you deal with
[52:16] this situation this woman is married
[52:18] five times
[52:19] but not only that worse than that but
[52:22] now she's living without man that is not
[52:25] her husband how do you deal with that
[52:28] Grace the grace of God the grace of God
[52:34] that grace of God go further than
[52:38] anything that you can commit on this
[52:40] side of Glory
[52:43] for he stayed there on the cross he
[52:46] stayed there until every sin that was
[52:48] possible that you could have committed
[52:51] was paid for
[52:56] I said Messiah comment and he's going to
[52:58] tell us what we ought to he's going to
[53:00] tell us what to do about our mortal
[53:01] problems and all this thing he said I
[53:03] that speak unto thee I am he
[53:06] amen
[53:08] praise God hallelujah
[53:10] [Music]
[53:11] amen I had to say that
[53:13] and so you know they said well
[53:16] you know it depends on who your mother
[53:19] and your father is
[53:22] because they said
[53:24] you know the prophet says well I can't
[53:27] see adultery
[53:29] big predestinated
[53:31] so what your mother and father did he
[53:35] said that's not predestinated and I
[53:38] can't see that in the rapture
[53:40] he said he can't see that in the Rapture
[53:42] but I applied the blood of Jesus Christ
[53:46] because we were all born wrong to begin
[53:50] with amen
[53:52] we were all gone wrong yeah so whether
[53:55] you were married or you're not you're
[53:56] all born wrong for them to begin with is
[53:59] it right it's not the act of your mother
[54:01] and father that is predestinated
[54:05] it's the germ of life and the thoughts
[54:08] of God so that's why when God had to go
[54:11] beyond
[54:13] who your mama is he has to go beyond
[54:16] what your father is are you there with
[54:18] me you have to go back to himself
[54:22] hello
[54:24] so God loved looking at all you came
[54:27] here is looking at what's in him
[54:31] so when he said let us you are part of
[54:35] that amen and there's no mortal and hurt
[54:39] that can change that purpose you said
[54:42] and brother Keith how do I know that
[54:43] it's in me it's revealed to you amen
[54:47] hallelujah it's not what you do it's
[54:50] what God did
[54:52] so you know I was on drugs I was doing
[54:54] all these things and then I found God
[54:57] you never find God
[54:59] no no God was always calling
[55:03] back all his attributes amen and in the
[55:07] time appointed
[55:09] Hallelujah you step into your position
[55:13] are you with me
[55:15] Hallelujah
[55:17] and if you don't believe that you're
[55:19] bounding the blood of Jesus Christ
[55:23] amen
[55:24] Hallelujah
[55:26] but it reaches to the highest mountain
[55:29] and it flow to the lowest Valley the
[55:33] blood that give me strength from day to
[55:35] day it shall never
[55:37] never
[55:39] lose its power
[55:41] amen the prophet says now paragraph 144
[55:45] continued he said this is Rich to me
[55:49] just even to think of it
[55:52] see what God's purpose was
[55:55] and why didn't he just keep Adam and Eve
[55:58] like that then he would never been able
[56:01] to express his fullness
[56:05] is full attribute because he could have
[56:08] been a father there that's true but also
[56:12] he's a savior how do you know he was he
[56:16] hears a cause I've had the experience
[56:20] he's a savior and he had to express that
[56:25] and how could he do it only through
[56:28] Christ amen how could he be a son holy
[56:33] true Christ how could he be a Healer
[56:36] only through Christ all things are wound
[56:40] up into that one person Jesus Christ
[56:43] it's not wound in your mother and father
[56:46] it's not wound in the denomination you
[56:49] come from did not mourned in the country
[56:51] of living it's wound up in Jesus Christ
[56:55] amen so get past your yesterday get past
[57:00] What You Did In This World Heaven come
[57:02] up to the point of what he did for you
[57:09] it's not what I did
[57:11] it is what he did
[57:13] Hallelujah second Corinthians 5 21 he
[57:17] said that he becomes sin for me
[57:20] Amen in other words all the sin that you
[57:24] had commit
[57:25] and could commit he become that and for
[57:29] that he will he went to the cross and he
[57:32] paid the price of that sin
[57:34] then he said that you might become the
[57:38] righteousness of God in him
[57:41] if you can believe that he becomes sin
[57:43] for you why can't you believe that you
[57:47] become righteousness
[57:48] if you are convicted of all the sins you
[57:51] have committed and he comes and pay the
[57:54] price
[57:55] oh Hallelujah then you can go free
[57:59] hallelujah amen what kind of man is that
[58:02] but he set me free he said and then to
[58:06] bring that
[58:07] fullness of the guarded bodily
[58:10] Hallelujah into a people that he could
[58:14] have the preeminence the oversight the
[58:16] leading
[58:17] so what he did he bring the fullness of
[58:20] the godhead in you
[58:23] Hallelujah
[58:24] amen praise God 1963 the super sign he
[58:29] said oh God
[58:30] if the world could only see that that
[58:33] God and man are one amen so not God and
[58:36] Christ now but God and man
[58:40] Christ Jesus bridge the gap
[58:44] to bring man back into the position of
[58:47] God because the sonship is only for a
[58:50] time until the Plan of Redemption is
[58:53] over and all that was in the mind of God
[58:56] go back to God
[58:58] then what need directly for a son
[59:01] no no
[59:02] because Redemption plan is over I'll not
[59:07] leave one
[59:08] none that the father give me shall be
[59:11] lost save the Son of Perdition amen
[59:14] hallelujah praise God he said that super
[59:18] sign was that first man that God could
[59:21] come into
[59:22] all that God was he poured into Christ
[59:26] and that's why we go through that this
[59:28] morning and all that Christ was so if
[59:31] you listen if you can believe that all
[59:33] that God was he poured into Christ can
[59:36] you believe
[59:37] that all that Christ was he poured into
[59:40] the church
[59:44] if all that God was he poured into
[59:48] Christ
[59:49] what a revelation
[59:51] what a revelation then can you step down
[59:55] now and believe that on all that Christ
[59:58] was he poured into the church
[1:00:03] Hallelujah
[1:00:05] that said my heart rejoicing amen a
[1:00:09] super sign Hallelujah
[1:00:11] God and man together
[1:00:14] it was to be the Super sign of the last
[1:00:17] day when the entire Bible was to be
[1:00:20] fulfilled in the last day a super sign a
[1:00:24] virgin shall conceive Hallelujah and
[1:00:27] this conception
[1:00:28] when it's brought forth will be God
[1:00:32] manifested in flesh Hallelujah
[1:00:36] amen a super sign they still don't
[1:00:40] believe it but it was anyhow it's still
[1:00:43] a super sign notice Hallelujah they've
[1:00:46] got Superman today they've got fictions
[1:00:50] of Superman and all these other kind of
[1:00:53] super things but the church has got a
[1:00:56] super sign God back in the church
[1:00:59] manifesting in human flesh is a rat and
[1:01:04] Brethren when the supernatural is
[1:01:06] returned to you then we will say the
[1:01:09] word is made flesh again amen
[1:01:14] it's not just on the pages of the Bible
[1:01:17] but it has stepped from the page into a
[1:01:20] body somebody that will manifest that
[1:01:23] word
[1:01:24] the Bible said that they did not believe
[1:01:27] him
[1:01:29] but when he went into Nazareth where he
[1:01:31] was brought up and as a custom was on
[1:01:34] the Sabbath day he went into the
[1:01:36] synagogue they handled the scroll and he
[1:01:40] found the place where it was written of
[1:01:42] him
[1:01:43] the spirit of the Lord is upon me for he
[1:01:46] has anointed me to preach Deliverance to
[1:01:49] the captive
[1:01:52] there were sinners
[1:01:54] they were Bound in sin but he come
[1:01:56] preaching Deliverance to the captive the
[1:01:59] opening of the eyes of the blind to set
[1:02:02] up labor to them that are abound and he
[1:02:04] closed the book
[1:02:06] he did not read the scripture for
[1:02:08] yesterday for the future he read the
[1:02:11] scripture for that day
[1:02:13] and he hand it back to this scroll to
[1:02:15] the priests and he'd take his seat
[1:02:18] and look at what they said they said is

[1:02:42] said on this day is this scripture

[1:04:00] has become one
[1:04:02] Hallelujah
[1:04:04] amen he said oh if that was a super sign
[1:04:08] of that day
[1:04:10] when that same spirit that was on Jesus
[1:04:13] Christ comes into his church to manifest
[1:04:17] the written word for today
[1:04:21] Hallelujah that is still the super sign
[1:04:25] amen
[1:04:27] in Saint John 14 23 the Bible says and
[1:04:31] Jesus answered and said unto him
[1:04:33] if a man loved me
[1:04:35] he will keep my words
[1:04:37] and my father will love him
[1:04:40] and we will we will come unto him and

[1:04:47] we're going to live with him in him
[1:04:50] amen
[1:04:52] and you know I want you to bear this in
[1:04:54] mind when we say the Son and the father
[1:04:58] when the logos comes from the eternal
[1:05:02] spirit
[1:05:03] to the logos that eternal spirit is
[1:05:07] father
[1:05:09] amen
[1:05:10] and the logos was a veil and when the
[1:05:13] theophany man stepped there
[1:05:16] amen
[1:05:17] when he become Melchizedek
[1:05:20] that wave that he come from he says
[1:05:23] father
[1:05:24] amen amen amen hallelujah amen and when
[1:05:28] from that logos he become the Virgin
[1:05:30] born son he looked back at that
[1:05:33] theophany and he says father because it
[1:05:36] gave birth to himself
[1:05:39] hallelujah amen God gave birth to God
[1:05:44] amen so he said the eternal spirit give
[1:05:47] birth to the logos the logos give birth
[1:05:49] to the theophany amen
[1:05:52] and that theophany Hallelujah he could
[1:05:55] not eat nor drink with man but brother
[1:05:58] bran said he put on 16 elements he put
[1:06:00] on dos and Abram had communion with him
[1:06:04] Genesis 14 but then in Genesis 18 he
[1:06:08] visited Abraham to confirm the promise
[1:06:11] which is your promise
[1:06:14] hallelujah amen and he troll 16 elements
[1:06:18] he turned us upon that theophany and so
[1:06:22] Abram served him a meal and he had a
[1:06:25] meal with Abraham God come down and
[1:06:28] feast with man
[1:06:30] Hallelujah and how do you know that is
[1:06:34] God when his back turned to the tent he
[1:06:38] tell the secret that was in Sarah's
[1:06:41] heart
[1:06:42] the Messiah sign that when he met the
[1:06:46] woman of Samaria hallelujah amen and he
[1:06:50] said Google go call your husband
[1:06:53] because she said give me that water you

[1:06:58] husband he said you have well said
[1:07:01] he knows that she speak the truth you

[1:07:10] had five husbands and the one you have
[1:07:12] now is not yours you know might be
[1:07:15] nobody in the city know that she had
[1:07:17] that sixth one but he knows
[1:07:21] I perceive your own Prophet all your
[1:07:23] Prophet can do that the same exact sign
[1:07:26] that was revealed to Abram and Sarah
[1:07:29] comes to the woman of Samaria
[1:07:32] and that same sign is going to be in the
[1:07:34] bride
[1:07:35] when we move from the intellectual
[1:07:39] that's fundamental and get to the
[1:07:41] supernatural
[1:07:44] amen
[1:07:46] Church yeah we're not excited about what
[1:07:50] we hear
[1:07:51] we become so starchy and stiff-necking

[1:18:17] Jesus Christ himself being the Chief
[1:18:20] Cornerstone amen in whom all the

[1:18:38] amen
[1:18:40] hallelujah amen
[1:18:44] thank you oh Jesus thank you Christ's
[1:18:47] life in you
[1:18:49] make him the center of the revelation
[1:18:53] Christ in the Bible makes the Bible the
[1:18:56] complete revelation of Christ and Christ
[1:18:59] in you make you the complete revelation
[1:19:02] of the whole thing
[1:19:03] hallelujah amen what God is trying to do
[1:19:08] yes this is it
[1:19:11] this is it you said my brother Keith
[1:19:14] I've got pain in my body I'm getting
[1:19:15] hold this one's gotta die
[1:19:19] amen
[1:19:21] you you won't have the it like this and
[1:19:23] the change as a matter of fact
[1:19:26] you notice the Bible brother wait I want
[1:19:28] you to go and look at that
[1:19:30] that when he speaks of the body after
[1:19:33] the resurrection
[1:19:34] it never says flesh and blood
[1:19:39] because there's no more blood in your
[1:19:40] bloodstream after that
[1:19:42] you see the blood is not the life but
[1:19:45] the life is in the blood
[1:19:47] but when the Redemption comes in and the
[1:19:49] change of the body it's the Holy Ghost
[1:19:52] that will be in you amen that moves you
[1:19:56] therefore you'll never go whole you know
[1:19:58] if you know I was talking to a friend
[1:20:01] that works with me and you know his
[1:20:03] uncle you know owns the funeral home in
[1:20:06] linstead and so he used to go on
[1:20:08] part-time and help him to embalm the
[1:20:10] bodies and he was telling me how he does
[1:20:12] it he said first you've got to get out
[1:20:14] all the blood he said there's some
[1:20:16] archers that you're going to get into
[1:20:17] and you pump all the blood out of the
[1:20:20] body
[1:20:21] you know why because if the blood is
[1:20:23] there that body is going to decay
[1:20:25] so they take out all that blood and they
[1:20:28] put in the embalming fluid and when the
[1:20:31] embalming fluid is in that body you can
[1:20:33] set it aside in the corner for as long
[1:20:35] as you want to it will never decay
[1:20:38] amen
[1:20:39] you see that's what God is going to do
[1:20:42] man in your change they will remove the
[1:20:46] blood out of your body and the Holy
[1:20:48] Ghost will be what's the life inside of
[1:20:52] you
[1:21:00] you'll never grow old
[1:21:03] but he's going to restore your youth
[1:21:05] like he's done the eagle
[1:21:07] yeah
[1:21:09] it's not as though you've been 50 years
[1:21:12] and a few days I'm going to be 58. man
[1:21:16] I've had some rough days
[1:21:18] but he's going to restore that to my
[1:21:21] youth but he's going to remove all the
[1:21:23] trials and the tests and amen
[1:21:26] I can just imagine some of you take your
[1:21:28] pictures when you are young and put it
[1:21:30] there you're going to look better than
[1:21:31] that I tell you
[1:21:33] because some of you when you were eating
[1:21:35] you you really was a good looking
[1:21:44] but in that renewed body
[1:21:47] Richard you'll be good looking
[1:21:49] I'm not saying you're not
[1:21:52] amen
[1:21:54] Hallelujah

[1:36:07] bless you brother
[1:36:09] your sister there but you know the
[1:36:12] world's building bombs
[1:36:15] but they're building shelters they're
[1:36:18] building so many feets that concrete
[1:36:20] they're taking these old bunkers and
[1:36:21] they're making them into places that you
[1:36:24] can make it through the Holocaust or
[1:36:25] whatever it is you know make it through
[1:36:27] the the nuclear war that's coming or or
[1:36:31] whatever more and something they're
[1:36:34] building this and building that and
[1:36:35] building this and building that and the
[1:36:37] rich folks thinks they're all going to
[1:36:39] be the same on the ones that can stay
[1:36:40] around because they build the biggest
[1:36:42] shelters
[1:36:45] we build ours to feathers yes
[1:36:51] we build ours with feathers
[1:36:54] greatest shelter there ever was
[1:36:56] under the wings of Mama Eagle
[1:36:59] thank God for a prophet that was
[1:37:01] standing out there one day and he saw
[1:37:02] that great big eagle
[1:37:04] yes and he saw the one he said oh it'd
[1:37:06] been beat down because of the storm you
[1:37:08] know it had it had to land but they
[1:37:10] sometimes you might get a storm
[1:37:12] it may beat you down and it may knock
[1:37:14] you to the ground
[1:37:16] it may put you in a tree but I promise
[1:37:19] you that eagle never was not an eagle
[1:37:24] doesn't matter how low he was sitting on
[1:37:27] the ground he was sitting in a tree or
[1:37:29] he was soaring in the height he was
[1:37:30] still an eagle and when that storm went
[1:37:33] away brother Brown said what'd he do he
[1:37:34] said he knew what he had
[1:37:40] he said he pitched off that limb and
[1:37:43] said he never flapped his wings and went
[1:37:45] down and hit the current well let's hit
[1:37:47] the current
[1:37:48] but you guys spread them first you got
[1:37:51] to know that you're an eagle number one
[1:37:53] you got to have confidence that you're
[1:37:54] an eagle you got to have confidence that
[1:37:56] those two Wings will take you wherever
[1:37:58] you need to go
[1:37:59] man can't ever build an airplane like
[1:38:01] God can build a a bird you take a little
[1:38:05] bird they'll just do this right here and
[1:38:06] they'll go right between two trees you
[1:38:08] can't do that with an airplane
[1:38:10] but they can do it we got little
[1:38:11] hummingbirds all over the place at the
[1:38:13] house what a mystery
[1:38:16] the hummingbird well the body this big
[1:38:18] wings that big and they're flapping at
[1:38:20] several hundred thousand beats per
[1:38:22] second you can't even see the wings
[1:38:25] but they just zip around back and forth
[1:38:27] you know but you know what God created
[1:38:29] that that's right God created that they
[1:38:31] created him for him to be that way he
[1:38:33] created us to do what get out of here
[1:38:35] yeah yeah our purpose on that thirst is
[1:38:38] to leave this earth that's what our
[1:38:40] purpose is not stay here it's to leave
[1:38:42] so let's give brother Keith another big
[1:38:43] hand God bless you
[1:38:46] good to have each and every one of you
[1:38:48] here we're going to take communion now
[1:38:50] if you want to go ahead and
[1:38:51] and um a musicians can can exit off the
[1:38:55] stage and we'll turn to First
[1:38:56] Corinthians
[1:38:58] um
[1:39:01] 11.
[1:39:03] verse 23.
[1:39:06] I said Thank you thank you brother James
[1:39:07] good for good to see you man I haven't
[1:39:09] seen you in a little bit good to have
[1:39:10] you with us he's been here many times
[1:39:12] before so he's not a visitor
[1:39:14] he's with family now he's he's
[1:39:16] comfortable he's good but good to have
[1:39:19] him with us and and the sister with us
[1:39:20] too
[1:39:21] God bless you but we're going to take
[1:39:23] communion
[1:39:26] Apostle Paul tells us
[1:39:29] for I have received of the Lord that
[1:39:31] which also I delivered unto you that the
[1:39:33] Lord Jesus the same night in which he
[1:39:35] was betrayed took bread
[1:39:37] now what's Paul doing Paul wasn't in the
[1:39:39] upper room right Paul wasn't there he by
[1:39:41] Revelation God's showing him a vision of
[1:39:43] what's going on so there had to be the
[1:39:45] right interpretation he had to give it
[1:39:47] to a prophet
[1:39:48] to give us the correct interpretation of
[1:39:50] what went on in that upper room and when
[1:39:53] he had given thanks he breaking and said
[1:39:55] take eat this is my body which is broken
[1:39:57] for you
[1:39:59] this do in remembrance of me after the
[1:40:03] same manner also he took the cup and hit
[1:40:05] when he had stopped saying this cup is
[1:40:07] the New Testament
[1:40:08] he knew he had to die remember we've
[1:40:11] been talking about a testament that's
[1:40:13] not enforced without the death of a
[1:40:14] testator so he knew he was going to die
[1:40:16] so this new testament can come about
[1:40:20] this cup is the New Testament in my
[1:40:22] blood this do you as often as you drink
[1:40:24] it in remembrance of me for as often as
[1:40:27] you eat this bread and drink this cup
[1:40:29] you do show the Lord's death
[1:40:31] till he come wherefore whosoever shall
[1:40:33] eat this bread and drink this cup of the
[1:40:35] Lord unworthily
[1:40:37] okay shall be guilty of the body and
[1:40:40] blood of the Lord but let a man examine
[1:40:42] himself but as our brother said but God
[1:40:45] but God has allowed us to be able to
[1:40:49] take communion and not be not be
[1:40:51] condemned if you'll do it right that's
[1:40:54] forgiveness amen for as often you eat
[1:40:56] this bread and drink this cup you just
[1:40:57] show the Lord's death wherefore
[1:40:59] whosoever shall eat this bread and drink
[1:41:01] this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be
[1:41:03] guilty of the body and blood of the Lord
[1:41:06] but let a man examine himself and sold
[1:41:08] any meat of that bread and drink of that
[1:41:09] cup for he that eateth and drinketh
[1:41:11] unworthily eat us and drink
[1:41:13] contamination what to himself not
[1:41:15] Discerning the Lord's body now who's the
[1:41:17] Lord's body
[1:41:18] we are all right we're the Lord's body
[1:41:21] for this cause many are weak and sickly
[1:41:23] among you many sleep
[1:41:26] for if we would judge ourselves we
[1:41:28] should not be judged but when we are
[1:41:30] judged
[1:41:31] we are chasten of the Lord that we
[1:41:33] should not be condemned with the world
[1:41:35] separation
[1:41:37] all right wherefore my brother when you
[1:41:39] come together to eat Terry
[1:41:41] one for another and if any man hunger
[1:41:43] let him eat at home that you may that
[1:41:45] you come not together under condemnation
[1:41:46] and the rest will I said in order
[1:41:49] when I come let's just take a moment of
[1:41:51] silence
[1:41:52] brother said pray for you Pastor pray
[1:41:55] for your brothers ask God to forgive you
[1:41:57] your sins so that we can take this
[1:41:58] communion without having any
[1:42:00] condemnation

[1:42:11] believers
[1:42:12] forgive us of our mistakes and faults
[1:42:14] and our sins Lord
[1:42:16] we stand here Lord complete in you
[1:42:18] father
[1:42:20] not looking at any of our inadequacies
[1:42:22] or
[1:42:23] or the things that we complexes and
[1:42:25] different things Lord we look to you the
[1:42:28] Altar and finisher of our faith father
[1:42:30] just be with us now in the furthermen of
[1:42:31] this service in Jesus name
[1:42:33] amen the Bible said he took bread and he
[1:42:35] blessed it heavily followed this bread
[1:42:38] Lord
[1:42:39] was not made in some Factory or
[1:42:41] come down some line and then was frozen
[1:42:44] and
[1:42:45] and put in a box Lord it was made with
[1:42:47] holy hands it was prepared Lord in a way
[1:42:50] that when we take it Lord whatever is
[1:42:52] left over
[1:42:53] Lord will burn him because if we don't
[1:42:55] want to hold it over until tomorrow
[1:42:56] Connor I pray now go today right now
[1:43:00] this this bread Lord that as we partake
[1:43:03] it Lord that it'll become or something
[1:43:05] new to us let us walk Lord in newness of
[1:43:08] life when we take this and realize that
[1:43:10] you you hung on Calvary for our sins
[1:43:13] father all of our sin
[1:43:15] and Lord that your blood was shed Lord
[1:43:17] that as our brother said this the life
[1:43:20] that's in that blood is what gives us
[1:43:22] strength father just bless it now in
[1:43:24] Jesus name
[1:43:30] amen
[1:43:34] I know I've said this before about
[1:43:36] there's a new ones here we mom dad was a
[1:43:40] deacon in the Baptist Church so he was
[1:43:41] in charge of the communion
[1:43:44] and you know
[1:43:46] bro John and I remember them getting the
[1:43:48] little wafer box out of the freezer
[1:43:52] and open it up you know like I'm I'm
[1:43:54] sorry but like a chicken pot pie you
[1:43:56] know you open the thing up there's all
[1:43:57] this doughy squares not knowing where it
[1:44:00] come from or who made it or or what was
[1:44:02] going on but that's that was their
[1:44:04] revelation of the bread and then what we
[1:44:07] didn't use
[1:44:08] we sure didn't have a revelation of
[1:44:11] because we just stuck it back in freezer
[1:44:12] and used it the next month at the
[1:44:15] Baptist church and then mama would pour
[1:44:17] the Welch's grape juice into the cups
[1:44:20] halfway up because you had to cut it so
[1:44:23] then so then Baptists didn't get choked
[1:44:26] so but I didn't know
[1:44:29] we're going to take real wine
[1:44:31] the real wine never gets old because
[1:44:33] that Welch's grape juice it has an
[1:44:35] expiration date on it right this does
[1:44:37] not have an expiration date
[1:44:41] but it's Revelation it's thank God for a
[1:44:43] prophet he sent us a prophet to tell us
[1:44:45] these things
[1:44:46] amen and show us that it always was in
[1:44:50] the types in the Bible
[1:44:52] of the manor and all the things there
[1:44:55] not not drinking uh great juice
[1:44:59] but drinking
[1:45:00] wine because it gets better
[1:45:03] then we then he preached on stimulation
[1:45:05] of Revelation
[1:45:06] and all that going together there we we
[1:45:08] see that the Lord absolutely give us the
[1:45:12] real meaning of this right here right
[1:45:15] not just to take it because we have to
[1:45:17] need to but we want to all right come
[1:45:20] boldly to the throne of grace that's
[1:45:22] right you're handling father thanks for
[1:45:24] this wine Lord it was prepared Lord
[1:45:26] maybe even several months ago but lord
[1:45:28] it's got better and better with age just
[1:45:30] as Revelation Lord it just gets better
[1:45:32] and better Lord it gets gooder and
[1:45:34] gooder
[1:45:34] I pray that you Sanctified to our bodies
[1:45:37] Lord and be with this group of people or
[1:45:39] may we may we come under that
[1:45:42] sanctification that we were talking
[1:45:43] about Lord they'll Clean us out Lord and
[1:45:46] set us aside for service more than we
[1:45:48] ever have before father
[1:45:49] pray in Jesus name and
[1:45:53] come morning
[1:45:54] oh well
[1:45:57] by the river
[1:46:00] I'll rest boy what a day the Ever Green
[1:46:05] Tree
[1:46:08] I'll carry
[1:46:13] through the midnight
[1:46:16] come morning
[1:46:18] there's glory for me
[1:46:22] [Music]
[1:46:24] sometimes I'm despised and rejected
[1:46:31] and I question
[1:46:34] oh Father how
[1:46:39] get weary sometimes don't we take one
[1:46:43] more one more look
[1:46:45] at Mount Calvary
[1:46:49] and it gives me
[1:46:51] the strength to
[1:46:54] go on
[1:46:56] come morning thank God we had a prophet
[1:46:59] tell us Rapture is going to take place
[1:47:01] in the morning sometime between six and
[1:47:02] nine o'clock
[1:47:04] and we're just going to step over into
[1:47:06] another dimension
[1:47:08] I was somewhere the other day and
[1:47:12] someone in Baptist or Methodist he was
[1:47:15] talking about the wedding supper
[1:47:18] wanting to know what we was going to eat
[1:47:19] and how we was going to serve it thank
[1:47:21] God for a prophet he said we're taking
[1:47:24] communion
[1:47:25] so I'm not worried about the rest of it
[1:47:27] miles long the table
[1:47:30] miles long
[1:47:33] a table spread
[1:47:35] for the saints of God are fed amen he
[1:47:38] invites his chosen people amen come and
[1:47:41] die
[1:47:42] Bread and Wine
[1:47:45] boy talking about turning the water into
[1:47:47] wine for a for a a wedding supper
[1:47:50] this would be millions of people for
[1:47:53] miles
[1:47:54] that we'll have wine and it'll never be
[1:47:57] it'll never be exhaustible it'll be
[1:47:59] inexhaustible
[1:48:01] and we'll be able to just Hey listen he
[1:48:04] was down here one day and we needed
[1:48:06] bread and he just kept breaking it off
[1:48:08] and handing it to the people then it's
[1:48:09] got 5 000 people he he took that bread
[1:48:12] and like brother Brown said he said
[1:48:15] whatever molecule that was that burst in
[1:48:16] his hand it cooked it while he had it in
[1:48:18] his hand and man it just didn't give you
[1:48:20] something doughy he gave you the bread
[1:48:22] that was already cooked and the fish it
[1:48:23] was already fried or broiled for those
[1:48:26] of you that are trying to lose weight
[1:48:27] but
[1:48:29] that's all just a little microcosm of
[1:48:32] what we're going to see on the other
[1:48:33] side
[1:48:36] we can't fathom it much but we're trying
[1:48:39] us as ministers we're trying to get you
[1:48:41] to see right
[1:48:43] that you are the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:48:45] you are why this whole thing
[1:48:48] you're why the Bible was written yes
[1:48:51] you're literally literally the Bible we
[1:48:53] won't be carrying Bibles around in
[1:48:55] heaven I don't believe
[1:48:57] we become the Bible
[1:48:59] and as we become the Bible we are the
[1:49:01] pages and we're all those were written
[1:49:03] Epistles
[1:49:04] and we're going to be able to tell our
[1:49:05] story
[1:49:07] John's going to be able to tell his Paul
[1:49:09] Peter all the different ones and be able
[1:49:11] to tell their story and that will be
[1:49:13] things that are not written in this by
[1:49:14] In This Book right here
[1:49:16] it's like Keith and I were talking to
[1:49:19] you you only you need the blood you need
[1:49:22] salvation here
[1:49:23] you won't need salvation there you'll be
[1:49:25] done I've told you many times before

[1:51:21] while he was sitting somewhere in his
[1:51:23] Earthly Journey he looked out and said
[1:51:25] they're only going to need 44 cups to

[1:51:58] except for being ended the devil in
[1:52:00] heaven now put in the heart of Judas is
[1:52:01] carry Simon son to betray him
[1:52:03] Jesus knowing that the father had given
[1:52:05] all things into his hand look and that
[1:52:07] he was come from God somebody said that
[1:52:09] today didn't he okay that he was come
[1:52:12] from God and went to God now whatever
[1:52:14] the whatever speaks at the bride groomed
[1:52:17] now he's the bride groom were the bride
[1:52:19] a prophet of God told us those two comes
[1:52:22] together same scripture speaks of him
[1:52:24] speaks of us so guess what
[1:52:27] realize today that you come from God and
[1:52:30] you're going back to God
[1:52:31] he rises from supper and laid aside his
[1:52:33] Garmin took a towel and girded himself
[1:52:35] after that he pours water into a basin
[1:52:37] and began to wash the disciples feet and
[1:52:39] to walk them with a towel with he was
[1:52:41] girded then cometh he to Simon Peter and
[1:52:44] Peter said unto him Lord thus thou wash
[1:52:46] my feet
[1:52:48] Peter's fixing to he's fixing to get a
[1:52:51] lesson because he's fixing to write this
[1:52:52] a few years later so he's getting a
[1:52:55] lesson
[1:52:57] on that statue of perfect man
[1:52:59] humility brotherly kindness Temperance
[1:53:02] patience all in this one little group
[1:53:05] right here then cometh he to Simon Peter
[1:53:07] and Peter saying him Lord do you wash my
[1:53:09] feet
[1:53:10] Jesus said unto him what I do thou
[1:53:12] knowest not now he knew that
[1:53:14] but Thou shalt know Hereafter second
[1:53:16] Peter 1.
[1:53:18] Peter said unto him Thou shalt never
[1:53:20] wash my feet don't ever tell Jesus never
[1:53:23] because he's fixing to tell you
[1:53:24] something don't ever say never all right
[1:53:26] you shall never wash my feet Jesus said
[1:53:29] if I wash thee not thou Hast no part
[1:53:31] he made it pretty plain pretty
[1:53:33] straightforward
[1:53:35] and and no beating around the bush as we
[1:53:37] say in the south
[1:53:39] he said if I don't wash your feet you'll
[1:53:41] have no part with me in other words your
[1:53:43] part with me will be cut off
[1:53:45] that's why it's so important
[1:53:47] um Simon Peter said unto him Lord not my
[1:53:49] feet only but also my hands and my head
[1:53:51] in other words just pour it all over me
[1:53:52] now
[1:53:53] Jesus said unto him he that is washed
[1:53:55] and he is not saved to wash his feet but
[1:53:57] it's clean ever wet
[1:53:59] and you are clean but not all for he
[1:54:01] knew who should betray him therefore he
[1:54:03] said you are not all clean so after he
[1:54:05] had washed their feet and had taken His
[1:54:07] Garment was set down he said unto them
[1:54:09] know you what I've done to you he's
[1:54:11] asking him a question
[1:54:12] you call me master and Lord and you say
[1:54:15] well
[1:54:15] for so I am he's coming down to the end
[1:54:17] of his journey sometimes he wouldn't
[1:54:18] he'd tell him not to call me this and
[1:54:20] don't call me that he said you call me
[1:54:22] mastering Lord he said so I am I'm I'm
[1:54:25] he I'm him all right if I then your Lord
[1:54:29] and Master have washed your feet you
[1:54:31] also ought to wash one another's feet
[1:54:33] for I have given you an example that you
[1:54:36] should do as I have done to you verily
[1:54:38] barely I say unto you the servant is not
[1:54:40] greater than his Lord
[1:54:42] needless he that sent greater than he
[1:54:45] that sent him
