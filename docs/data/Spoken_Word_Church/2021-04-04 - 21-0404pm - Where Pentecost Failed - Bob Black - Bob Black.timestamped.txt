[20:19] it's good to be in the house of the lord
[20:20] on this on this resurrection
[20:23] sunday uh how many enjoyed that message
[20:26] this morning that we that we heard that
[20:27] was
[20:27] uh i mean
[20:32] i told brother dale this morning uh he
[20:34] uh i'm actually gonna preach on the
[20:35] exact same scripture and
[20:38] uh y'all might hear an echo this
[20:40] afternoon
[20:42] but i told him uh he didn't leave me
[20:44] anything to preach
[20:45] he just covered it so but anyway
[20:48] um you know this time of year i always
[20:52] kind of like to think about
[20:53] you know this is april 4th of course
[20:55] it's my birthday and
[20:56] but you know brother brown when he was
[20:58] covering the seals and and
[20:59] daniel's 70 weeks and all he he kind of
[21:02] he
[21:03] thank god for a prophet because he was
[21:05] able to just kind of expose some things
[21:07] that
[21:08] you know i don't think anybody else in
[21:10] the world is aware of like
[21:11] what exactly happened on this day now we
[21:13] know jesus rose from the grave on sunday
[21:16] and that's
[21:17] why we we come to church on sunday is
[21:19] because he rose from the grave on this
[21:21] day
[21:22] but on april 4th 18 30 you know brother
[21:24] ram said on
[21:25] april 2nd he rode into jerusalem on that
[21:27] on the little donkey and
[21:29] and then on april 4th they went down to
[21:31] the temple and
[21:32] and then they uh uh his disciples
[21:34] started asking him some questions and
[21:36] they went over to the mount of olives
[21:37] and they sat down on the mount of olives
[21:38] and
[21:38] he preached matthew chapter 24 where he
[21:42] started talking about the seals and all
[21:43] those kind of things and
[21:45] so we just thank god for profit we've
[21:47] we've heard uh not
[21:48] not a message not from just some man or
[21:50] some man's ideas but we've actually
[21:52] heard
[21:53] direct from god that you've even be able
[21:54] to pinpoint exactly what happened on
[21:56] this day
[21:58] so maybe you don't want to drive home
[21:59] tonight or or you know just when you're
[22:01] pondering and thinking
[22:02] reflect back on on what actually
[22:04] happened on on this day
[22:06] so many thousands of years ago and now
[22:08] all all you know
[22:10] everything that we believe and
[22:11] everything that we that that we've
[22:13] heard the brother brown preach and all
[22:15] the seven church ages all came from the
[22:17] ministry of that one man jesus christ
[22:19] who preached for three and a half years
[22:21] and it all came from what he did
[22:26] so i let's go to ephesians chapter one
[22:29] verses one to seven and i'm gonna um
[22:31] preach uh maybe a strange topic for
[22:35] easter sunday um where pentecost failed
[22:40] and just uh really try to break down a
[22:43] message that brother brown preached
[22:44] yeah i think in 1955 where he said he
[22:47] called it where i think pentecost failed
[22:49] i think we can say with definitive
[22:52] definitely
[22:53] after we maybe study through this where
[22:55] pentecost failed
[22:57] and maybe by god's grace by the end of
[22:59] this afternoon you'll be able to answer
[23:01] the question with confidence
[23:02] where did pentecost fail let's go to the
[23:05] lord in prayer before we go
[23:07] to the word lord we we thank you so much
[23:09] for your grace and mercy to us to be
[23:11] able to gather in the house of god and
[23:12] to be able to look into your word lord
[23:14] jesus and lord we can look into the word
[23:16] the lord but we need the author to come
[23:18] and show us what it really means lord
[23:20] and i pray god that you'll come and
[23:22] lord let my god my tongue lord jesus god
[23:24] in my mouth to speak the truth lord
[23:26] jesus and open up the
[23:27] ears of the hearers lord jesus lord that
[23:29] lord that the truth will be quickened to
[23:31] them lord jesus that it won't just be
[23:33] confusing words lord but let it be a
[23:35] certain sound lord that nobody would
[23:36] leave
[23:37] wondering what was said and wondering
[23:39] what was done and wonder what we're here
[23:40] for
[23:41] but leave lord god knowing for certain
[23:44] that they heard from you
[23:45] that something was said that would be
[23:47] edifying to them lord god
[23:48] well i ask this lord this blessing upon
[23:50] your people lord jesus and be with
[23:52] brother wade and
[23:53] be with all the other ones around the
[23:54] world lord jesus that are coming
[23:55] together on this day lord jesus
[23:57] that is special to your bride and
[23:59] christians all around the world
[24:00] we ask this blessing as we read your
[24:02] word in the name of the lord jesus
[24:04] christ amen
[24:07] also somebody somebody reminded me um i
[24:09] think last week that
[24:10] that this was the day that that brother
[24:12] dick passed away about it it's been a
[24:13] year now so
[24:14] if sister gayle is listening in i just
[24:16] want to say we love you and we
[24:18] and we miss you and and we're praying
[24:19] for you constantly
[24:23] you think about that too you know
[24:24] brother dicks if we were to pass away
[24:26] brother dick be waiting there on the
[24:27] other side
[24:28] ready to greet us you know think about
[24:29] how brother branham said that
[24:31] that when you when you pass away it's
[24:32] just like just uh
[24:34] from from them passing away to coming up
[24:37] from the ground is just going to be like
[24:38] a blink of an eye to them and
[24:39] they they're not not even hardly any
[24:41] time passed so if we were to go over the
[24:44] uh you know pass away
[24:45] brother dick will be right there to
[24:47] greet us and
[24:48] and uh my what a blessing that is that
[24:50] god how god has arranged everything just
[24:52] so perfect so it's just
[24:54] perfect for our for our joy and our
[24:56] comfort and our happiness
[24:59] all right let's read ephesians chapter 1
[25:01] verses 1 to 7 says paul and apostle to
[25:03] jesus christ by the will of god to the
[25:05] saints which are at ephesus
[25:08] and to the faithful in christ jesus
[25:10] grace be to you and peace from god our
[25:12] father and from the lord jesus christ
[25:15] blessed be the god and father of our
[25:17] lord jesus christ who hath blessed us
[25:19] with all spiritual blessings in heavenly
[25:20] places in christ
[25:22] according as he hath chosen us in him
[25:24] before the foundation of the world
[25:26] that we should be holy and without blame
[25:28] before him in love
[25:30] having predestinated us unto the
[25:32] adoption of children
[25:34] by jesus christ to himself according to
[25:37] the good pleasure of his will
[25:39] to the praise of the glory of his grace
[25:41] wherein he hath made us accepted
[25:43] in the beloved in whom we have
[25:45] redemption through his blood
[25:47] the forgiveness of sins according to the
[25:49] riches
[25:50] of his grace you may be seated the lord
[25:52] bless his word
[25:56] now this is um you know i believe that
[25:59] as time goes on and as you as you grow
[26:01] and grace and knowledge that the lord is
[26:03] actually
[26:03] holding your testimony and honing
[26:05] holding your ability to speak
[26:07] correctly and accurately in a way that
[26:09] is is is less confusing and i believe
[26:11] that's what god has been doing in the
[26:12] bride around the world is
[26:13] is taking things that originally you
[26:15] know if you ever think that that you
[26:17] don't have any questions about the
[26:18] message just get to reading the message
[26:20] for a little bit
[26:20] and you'll find that there's a lot of
[26:22] things in the message that that
[26:24] are very perplexing or very very strange
[26:26] almost
[26:27] and some of the things that brother
[26:28] branham says it it takes a while for
[26:31] you know it really takes the leading of
[26:33] the holy spirit to correctly place
[26:34] things and so this topic where pentecost
[26:37] failed is maybe
[26:38] maybe one of the most controversial
[26:39] things that
[26:41] i i just in my in my own personal
[26:43] journey i've heard many people try to
[26:44] preach it
[26:45] and cause a lot of confusion because
[26:47] people try to speak on it
[26:49] cause a lot of confusion where where
[26:50] pentecost failed and
[26:52] and and so i i just pray that this
[26:54] morning the lord will
[26:55] just open it up and and give me uh uh
[26:59] give me uh the ability to articulate
[27:01] things in a way that won't be confusion
[27:03] i think a lot of the confusion comes
[27:05] from when you start talking about
[27:06] pentecost failing or something failing
[27:08] then
[27:08] people's minds immediately go to well
[27:10] you don't believe in the baptism in the
[27:11] holy ghost you don't believe in
[27:13] in god actually coming down in the with
[27:15] the pillar of fire or coming down and
[27:17] quickly the word to you
[27:18] coming down and revealing himself in a
[27:20] personal way and that is not what we're
[27:22] talking about
[27:24] so i want to first kind of make the
[27:25] statement to
[27:27] that that we absolutely we believe that
[27:29] the
[27:30] the holy ghost is still quickening the
[27:32] word the same way he did in the book of
[27:34] acts
[27:35] in acts 2 38 and there in the house of
[27:36] cornelius he's still coming and he's
[27:38] still able to quicken the word
[27:40] so he's still he's still moving in the
[27:42] hearts and lives of the believer he's
[27:44] still moving he's still able to reveal
[27:46] himself
[27:47] but you see it's important to understand
[27:49] where pentecost fell because brother
[27:50] branham if you go back and read this
[27:51] message
[27:52] go back i would encourage you to go back
[27:54] and read where i think pentecost failed
[27:56] he said
[27:56] the reason why we need to understand
[27:58] where pentecost failed is so that we
[28:00] don't fail now brother braham he said
[28:03] i'm going to read this quote he said i'm
[28:04] only trying to point out these facts
[28:07] facts and facts facts is something that
[28:10] you just put out there and
[28:11] and you got to deal with it and a lot of
[28:12] times we don't like facts
[28:14] but you put a fact out there and it's a
[28:16] fact we got to deal with it
[28:17] we got to figure out what what it means
[28:19] and what it means for us and he says i'm
[28:21] only trying to point out these facts
[28:22] that we might know where
[28:24] if we know where we made a mistake then
[28:27] the best thing to do is go right back
[28:29] there and start anew again
[28:31] come right over we know that something's
[28:33] happened
[28:34] and so if we know where it failed we
[28:36] will not fail and so maybe that's my
[28:38] subtitle of this message is where
[28:39] pentecost failed
[28:41] and you so you will not now you have to
[28:44] make the decision whether or not you're
[28:45] going to be in that group of those that
[28:46] will not fail or not that's up to you
[28:48] but i
[28:48] i want to i really want to preach a
[28:50] positive message this afternoon a
[28:52] positive message not not trying to
[28:54] beat people up or anything but just an
[28:56] encouraging message because
[28:58] you look at you look at where pentecost
[28:59] failed and it's almost like looking at
[29:01] like a shipwreck along the way you look
[29:03] at people's lives that brother i'm
[29:04] talking about people that fall away to
[29:06] the wayside people
[29:07] make mistakes and they're on the on the
[29:09] wayside and some you can look at that
[29:11] and and learn a
[29:12] lesson from it learn a lesson and avoid
[29:14] the same pitfall that they went into the
[29:16] same pitfall that they ran into so we
[29:19] believe
[29:20] we believe in the power of the holy
[29:22] ghost we believe in that same baptism of
[29:24] the holy ghost that fell on the day of
[29:26] pentecost and we believe
[29:28] that the power the baptism in the holy
[29:30] ghost has a purpose and it's to give
[29:31] unction to the book to the preacher like
[29:33] brother i'm preaching what was the holy
[29:34] ghost given for
[29:35] it's to give holiness to the group is to
[29:37] set the church in order
[29:38] it's to bring a unity of spirit it's to
[29:40] unite us together with power
[29:42] is to unite us together with love
[29:44] brotherly love
[29:46] and and you can see when the holy ghost
[29:48] does something in somebody's life it
[29:50] actually has an effect
[29:52] the power of the holy ghost like like
[29:53] jesus telling nicodemus he said
[29:55] the wind bloweth where it lifts us and
[29:57] now hears the sound there of but can't
[29:59] not
[29:59] tell what's it coming you can you don't
[30:01] know where it came from but you can tell
[30:02] when it was there
[30:04] you can see it rustling in the trees you
[30:06] can see it blowing across the lake you
[30:08] can tell the effects
[30:09] and you can see the effects of the holy
[30:11] ghost in somebody's life when the holy
[30:12] ghost comes and quickens the word that
[30:14] they've
[30:14] heard it will change that person it will
[30:17] cause something to happen in that
[30:18] person's life
[30:19] that is unmistakable so we believe in
[30:21] the power of the holy ghost
[30:23] we believe in the holy we believe in the
[30:25] original pentecostal experience
[30:29] and brother brown said he said and where
[30:31] i think pentecost failed he said oh my
[30:32] he began to talk about hunting and
[30:34] comparing
[30:35] isn't that interesting that he compared
[30:36] honey with the holy ghost and honey
[30:39] with the brotherly kindness when you get
[30:41] up the statue of a perfect man honey
[30:43] honey when you get up with all around
[30:44] believers that are filled with the holy
[30:46] ghost it's like honey and you begin to
[30:48] you begin to just like like those little
[30:49] bears that he told the story about
[30:51] you begin to lick the honey off of one
[30:52] another it's like you just get around
[30:54] one another
[30:55] and you feel that same joy because the
[30:57] holy ghost has an effect
[30:59] the holy ghost is is there to actually
[31:01] produce the life of christ in somebody
[31:03] and and brother ryan said there's no
[31:05] condemnation to them that's licking
[31:06] honey
[31:07] when you get around people that it's
[31:09] just like honey rolling off everything
[31:11] there's love and joy and peace and you
[31:13] love one another and it don't matter
[31:14] maybe if people throw in little barbs
[31:16] and make
[31:16] poking a little fun every now and then
[31:18] because there's love there there's holy
[31:19] ghost
[31:20] the holy ghost love the holy ghost is in
[31:22] the camp you see
[31:23] and program said you always see that
[31:25] when you camera you know he's talking
[31:26] about little bears and he says and
[31:28] that's what i mean when we get our hands
[31:30] in a honey jar you know
[31:31] just no condemnation just keep licking
[31:33] honey and have a good time
[31:35] now you might think that's just a little
[31:36] story brother brown threw in at the
[31:38] beginning of the sermon but as he gets
[31:40] down into this sermon where pentecost
[31:41] failed that has
[31:43] has an implication brother ram doesn't
[31:45] just tell stories just to tell stories
[31:47] but it has something to do with the
[31:49] point that he's trying to make the
[31:50] lesson that he's trying to bring
[31:52] and he begins he goes on and he says you
[31:54] were saved 1900 years ago
[31:56] when jesus died at calvary you accepted
[31:59] it two years ago
[32:00] or 10 years ago see there's where the
[32:02] sin question was settled
[32:03] before god's requirement was made the
[32:06] total price was paid in full at calvary
[32:08] and now from all the redemptive
[32:10] blessings that jesus died for is
[32:12] every one of your personal property you
[32:15] believers
[32:16] the only thing you have to do is just
[32:18] believe it accept it and call it yours
[32:20] now what he's saying is now you've got
[32:22] the holy ghost you have a right to every
[32:24] redemptive blessing that jesus died
[32:26] on on this easter morning for you to
[32:28] accept all you have to do is believe and
[32:31] accept it
[32:32] he said when a man is born again of the
[32:34] spirit of god god gives him a checkbook
[32:36] that'll last him all through life's
[32:38] journey
[32:38] oh my now he's starting to get into a
[32:40] problem there a problem area with the
[32:42] pentecostals
[32:43] so let's listen and see what he says and
[32:45] at the bottom of each check has got
[32:46] jesus's name
[32:48] written assigned to it and you just fill
[32:50] it out for any redemptive blessing
[32:52] you just fill it out it's already signed
[32:54] with his name but you got to sign your
[32:56] name to it
[32:56] in other words you got to say i believe
[32:58] it i accept it there's a check a check
[33:00] that you have access to when you're born
[33:02] again
[33:02] that you have access to every redemptive
[33:04] blessing and he said now surely
[33:07] surely you're not afraid then it won't
[33:09] be
[33:10] cash surely you're not afraid that it
[33:12] won't be cash
[33:14] if you're afraid you just hold the book
[33:17] in your pocket now if you've got a
[33:19] checkbook that gives you access to every
[33:21] redemptive blessing of god
[33:23] but you don't have faith that there's
[33:25] money in the bank to feel that check
[33:27] you'll keep that check in your pocket
[33:29] now see that's what brother
[33:30] he begins to talk about he said i found
[33:32] two classes of people and that is the
[33:34] fundamentalist and the pentecost
[33:35] pentecostals and one one has money in
[33:38] the bank in other words they've got the
[33:40] teaching they've got the background
[33:41] they've got
[33:42] they know what they have access to but
[33:43] they just don't have faith to put it out
[33:45] there and write a check
[33:47] they don't have faith for to just to
[33:49] make to put it into action
[33:51] but the other has a checkbook and they
[33:52] have they got faith for what the little
[33:54] bit they know but they don't have all
[33:55] the background
[33:56] and brother and said now if you can put
[33:58] those two together i believe that's what
[34:00] brother branham was doing through his
[34:01] whole ministry is trying to put those
[34:03] two together
[34:04] trying to get the people that can just
[34:05] step out on faith give them a little
[34:07] background give them a little knowledge
[34:09] give them a little teaching so that they
[34:10] know what they believe
[34:12] you see we're not trying to get away
[34:14] from pentecostal at pentecost to the
[34:16] actual moving of the holy ghost
[34:18] but what we're trying to do brother
[34:19] branham is trying to give that
[34:21] background the teaching
[34:22] that's why you need teaching he said if
[34:24] you can get a pentecostal
[34:26] to realize who they are and what that
[34:30] means is
[34:30] if you can get a real pinnacle a
[34:32] pentecostal that's been born
[34:34] again with this genuine baptism by the
[34:36] holy ghost
[34:37] and get them to realize by the teaching
[34:39] of the word by the opening of the word
[34:41] that they have a higher place of
[34:43] authority
[34:43] than even an angel if an angel of god
[34:46] was standing
[34:47] right here in this place you as a child
[34:49] of god because you are connected of god
[34:51] you are the actual manifestation of god
[34:54] in this earth
[34:55] you have a higher position of authority
[34:57] than even an angel
[34:58] and that's why paul with confidence
[35:00] could say if an angel were standing here
[35:02] and preaching any other thing than what
[35:04] i have already preached
[35:05] that letting me accursed i believe that
[35:07] the bride is coming to the same position
[35:09] the same position of power and authority
[35:11] to know that what she believes is
[35:13] correct to know that what
[35:15] she has a correct understanding she
[35:17] knows what god
[35:18] wants she knows what he wants wrong with
[35:21] his word
[35:21] and see god is bringing those two
[35:24] classes of people together
[35:25] and that's why in this message she'll
[35:27] say we we need to love one another
[35:29] we need to love one another because when
[35:31] the pentecostals and the fundamentals
[35:33] don't like one another and they don't
[35:34] want to be around one another they got
[35:36] something that both can contribute after
[35:38] you get them together
[35:39] get the teaching and get the dynamics
[35:41] and the power get it together then
[35:43] you've got something
[35:44] now brother i believe that's why he said
[35:47] that's why he said i'm jumping around in
[35:49] my my quotes here
[35:50] i believe that's why he said it it is
[35:52] the rising of the sun
[35:53] it is the rising of the sun that he said
[35:55] there has been churches
[35:57] churches brides brides churches brides
[36:00] but there has got to come one there's
[36:02] got to come one what
[36:04] a one bride that has got the teaching
[36:08] and the dynamics together that has got
[36:10] the fundamentals
[36:12] and the pentecostal that they're not
[36:14] afraid to scream in church when
[36:15] something happens
[36:16] but they know what they're screaming
[36:18] about they're not afraid to run down the
[36:20] aisle if something happens
[36:21] but they know what they're running about
[36:23] that it's not running about for some
[36:24] for some kind of silly sensation or
[36:26] something but they're running because
[36:28] god
[36:28] has revealed himself to them brother
[36:32] adam said there has got to come a real
[36:34] bride
[36:34] there must come one that's not only got
[36:37] the mechanics
[36:38] but the dynamics of it makes that church
[36:41] live
[36:42] move in the power of his resurrection
[36:44] there you'll see something
[36:45] when you got that kind of a church that
[36:47] kind of a bride that's got the
[36:49] background
[36:50] that's got that she knows what she has
[36:52] access to in the bank
[36:53] that she knows the benefits that she can
[36:55] draw from and then has the faith and the
[36:57] confidence
[36:58] to write the check write her name next
[37:00] to jesus christ
[37:02] on that checkbook something's got to
[37:03] happen listen that's when you're going
[37:05] to see the dead rise from the ground
[37:07] that's when you're going to see a people
[37:09] walk in the power of the demonstration
[37:10] of the holy ghost
[37:11] with signs following fulfilling exactly
[37:14] what god has promised in his word
[37:17] brother brown said so if you could ever
[37:18] get real good fundamental faith
[37:21] amongst pentecostal people or
[37:23] fundamental doctrine with the
[37:24] pentecostal people
[37:26] or vice versa i'd like to see what the
[37:28] meeting would be
[37:29] when the people realize that you are not
[37:31] you will be you are
[37:32] present tense right now sons and
[37:35] daughters of god
[37:37] and not just that you are sons of
[37:38] daughters of god but what that means
[37:41] what that means as god has put his power
[37:43] and his life
[37:44] and his characteristics in you and has
[37:47] molded you by the word
[37:48] has placed you by the word and put you
[37:50] positionally to a place of adoption
[37:55] he said you're pushing it way off out to
[37:57] the millennium somewhere
[37:59] all the blessings out of the millennium
[38:01] why it's
[38:02] right now we don't need divine healing
[38:05] in the millennium
[38:06] now is when we have it we won't be sons
[38:09] of god
[38:09] but now your sons of god and heirs join
[38:12] heirs with jesus
[38:13] and everything that jesus died for at
[38:15] calvary is your possession
[38:17] brother braham said brother satan don't
[38:20] like that
[38:21] because if the people would only realize
[38:25] and just be willing to take god at his
[38:28] word
[38:29] you would you just he said well it's
[38:31] unlimited
[38:32] why is it unlimited because god is
[38:35] unlimited the power of god is unlimited
[38:37] if you write the checkbook
[38:38] whatever you say whatever you say you
[38:41] can have access for you can have access
[38:44] if you need salvation for your family
[38:46] then speak it do you know that's what
[38:47] brother branham said the commission to
[38:49] the church
[38:50] was speak and go forward and you've been
[38:52] commissioned by god himself
[38:54] to speak and go forward not to hold back
[38:57] not to speak and go backwards
[38:58] but to go speak and go forward that's
[39:00] actually what your commission is
[39:02] your commission is to speak his word and
[39:05] go forward
[39:06] one step one step speak and keep moving
[39:10] and you'll see that's where pentecost
[39:11] failed
[39:13] brother brahm said and god perfecting
[39:15] his church he says now but the
[39:16] fundamentalist
[39:17] doesn't have any faith to operate what
[39:19] they believe they are
[39:21] the pentecostals has it but don't know
[39:23] who they are
[39:25] that's it and look it's just like a man
[39:27] who has a lot of money in the bank
[39:28] but he can't write a check the other man
[39:30] can write a check and ain't got no money
[39:32] in the bank
[39:33] if i could ever get them together
[39:34] brother the millennium
[39:37] would start if i could ever get those
[39:40] two together
[39:41] i believe that it's got to happen it's
[39:44] got to happen god
[39:45] that is that's that level of
[39:47] predestination that you don't even have
[39:48] nothing to do with
[39:49] there is going to be a bride where those
[39:52] two
[39:52] have come together fundamental and
[39:55] pentecostalism
[39:56] a church that knows what she stands for
[39:58] and believes it
[39:59] and is able to write that check brother
[40:02] brown said why this old nation would see
[40:04] something shaken like it never seen
[40:05] before
[40:06] signs and wonders would appear from
[40:08] everywhere if you could ever get
[40:09] fundamental faith
[40:11] and pentecostal people or a pentecostal
[40:13] faith and fundamental people
[40:15] the pentecostals has received the
[40:16] baptism of the holy ghost and that makes
[40:18] them a part fellowship and relationship
[40:20] with god
[40:21] that's born again and a son and daughter
[40:22] of god tell them out of the bible and
[40:24] they'll believe it
[40:25] but the thing of it is they forgot who
[40:28] they are
[40:29] why because they don't have that
[40:31] background they don't have the
[40:32] fundamental teaching
[40:33] that many times they're running around
[40:34] shouting for what they do not what but
[40:36] that doesn't mean that running around
[40:38] and shouting is wrong but if you can get
[40:40] the two together then you'll have what's
[40:41] right
[40:42] so many times we'll knock down somebody
[40:44] that's shouting and
[40:45] receiving a blessing from god and will
[40:47] say that's wrong it's not wrong
[40:49] you need to combine the two together and
[40:51] then you'll have what god wants there to
[40:53] be
[40:55] [Applause]
[40:59] i lost my place here the pentecostals
[41:03] has received the baptismal again
[41:05] he said they think they think he said
[41:07] they think well
[41:09] i don't know i don't know brother and
[41:12] sister god don't want you to think i
[41:14] don't know
[41:15] he wants you to know he wants you to
[41:17] know beyond a shadow of a doubt
[41:19] whether this message is right whether
[41:21] the baptism in the holy ghost is real
[41:23] whether the gospel is true whether it
[41:25] really will change you
[41:27] and when you know you're that's what's
[41:30] coming together you see he said oh
[41:31] brother you that's born again our sons
[41:33] and daughters of god
[41:34] co-equal with jesus christ and his
[41:36] presence oh my
[41:38] that's what makes the devil angry is let
[41:41] the church of god
[41:42] realize who they are
[41:47] when you get a church that is able to
[41:49] write the checkbook and knows who they
[41:51] are
[41:51] and knows the authority that they have
[41:53] and that they have access to the bank
[41:55] account
[41:55] and there ain't going to be no overdrawn
[41:58] funds
[41:59] you're going to have a church that will
[42:00] be an invincible army
[42:05] you see that's what the message is the
[42:07] message is really
[42:09] not so much closed hair and dress
[42:11] although that starts off it starts off
[42:12] maybe close hair and dress
[42:14] but the message the message is a
[42:16] revelation of a full bank account
[42:18] right and faith to access it that's what
[42:21] the revealing of god's word does
[42:23] it gives you an understanding of what
[42:25] you have access to
[42:27] a full bank account access to all of
[42:29] god's word
[42:30] and faith to access it and you've got
[42:32] brother and i said you've got faith
[42:34] you've got faith if you're born again
[42:35] everybody's got faith if they're born
[42:37] again
[42:37] but you got to know what you have access
[42:39] to to really use that faith
[42:41] you got to know what you've got access
[42:42] to brother said when you receive the
[42:44] holy ghost
[42:45] everything you've got in need of between
[42:47] hearing glory is right in you then
[42:50] it ain't listen to how he says it he
[42:52] said it ain't faith that you need
[42:54] it ain't faith that you need because
[42:56] you've already got it
[42:58] exactly he said you've got faith
[43:01] if you got the holy spirit for he is
[43:04] your faith isn't that what happens when
[43:07] you get born again
[43:08] you struggle with your own faith until
[43:10] he comes and accepts that faith and
[43:11] gives you
[43:12] his faith and then you've got something
[43:14] to believe with
[43:15] that's why paul said the life i live up
[43:17] now i live by the faith of the son of
[43:19] god because it's his faith
[43:21] living inside of you and that's why
[43:22] brother brown said he is your faith
[43:25] he's the one doing the believing on the
[43:27] inside if you if you're born again if
[43:29] you've got the new birth
[43:30] if you've got his life on the inside
[43:32] he's the one doing the believing
[43:34] so you don't need faith you've already
[43:36] got it
[43:37] what you need though you need teaching
[43:40] to tell you what you've got access to
[43:43] brother brown said the thing you have to
[43:44] know is know how to use that faith
[43:50] excuse me and brother brown he goes on
[43:52] he says there's two things that we have
[43:54] to watch closely
[43:56] one of them is an intellectual religion
[43:57] intellectual faith up in your head
[43:59] and the other one is a real born-again
[44:01] experience one of them is a head and the
[44:03] other one is in the heart and the bible
[44:05] says as a man thinketh in his heart
[44:07] so is he which seems real strange
[44:09] because you would think that you would
[44:10] think in your head
[44:12] but a christian is actually thinking
[44:13] from their heart you you're
[44:16] you're not using all the intellectual
[44:18] stuff the way that a sinner does
[44:19] you're not using your brain you're
[44:21] thinking from your heart and that's why
[44:22] a believer
[44:23] the christian experience is is love and
[44:26] joy and peace and long suffering and all
[44:28] those things
[44:28] coming from my heart coming from a
[44:30] rooted in faith an experience rooted in
[44:32] faith
[44:34] brother and i said not because you can
[44:35] be orthodox because you can explain your
[44:38] religion
[44:39] that isn't really what he meant by man
[44:42] must be born again
[44:43] it isn't so much intellectual but
[44:45] something has happened down here
[44:47] that's changed that man listen to what
[44:49] he says he says it's changed
[44:51] his motives that means
[44:54] that means a christian might fall and
[44:56] stumble and hold no and they go to
[44:58] repent god but their motives
[44:59] are correct you can fall and stumble and
[45:02] make mistakes but you'll come right back
[45:03] to the line because you're motive god
[45:05] has changed your motives
[45:06] he's softened up your heart he's put
[45:08] he's put himself inside of there
[45:10] so that your motive he's giving you his
[45:12] motives your motives are not driven by
[45:15] trying to appease the flesh and trying
[45:17] to appease the lust of the flesh and the
[45:18] pride of life and all those things
[45:20] now your motives are lined up you want
[45:22] to be right with god's word
[45:24] he said it changes his ideas where
[45:26] you've got ideas that
[45:28] you're looking at things through a
[45:29] carnal idea until you get the new birth
[45:31] and then when he changes your mind he
[45:33] changes your
[45:34] he renews your mind to look at it
[45:35] according to the word now you're looking
[45:38] at things differently
[45:39] because your mind has been changed your
[45:41] ideas have been changed you don't think
[45:43] about things the way you used to
[45:44] and it changes your life now see there
[45:47] in the message the token he'll tell you
[45:49] how to identify the new birth
[45:50] now we might have sensations and all
[45:52] those kind of things there are
[45:53] sensations associated with a new birth
[45:55] one place he said one place he said
[45:57] after the without the new birth it's the
[45:59] sensation with the new birth it's a
[46:00] blessing
[46:01] so there's something that happens it's
[46:02] not without a reaction or whatever
[46:04] but the way that you can really tell is
[46:06] look at the before and after
[46:08] look at the before before you're all
[46:10] mired down in the mud and stuff of the
[46:12] world but after
[46:13] something begins to change the holy
[46:15] ghost will have an effect on the life of
[46:17] a believer
[46:18] and it will change you listen it will
[46:19] take it'll take your pain off
[46:21] your toenails and your fingernails it'll
[46:23] make a man pull his pants up and get a
[46:25] good get a good job it'll make him want
[46:26] to do the best and everything
[46:28] that he does and it'll make a girl put
[46:30] some clothes on it'll make somebody
[46:32] listen listen i know the message is not
[46:34] about closed hair and dress but it'll
[46:35] start off that way
[46:36] why because god is starting you off
[46:38] little by little changing you
[46:40] he'll change you and somebody going
[46:42] around with uh
[46:43] a young man going around with their
[46:45] underwear hanging out and their pants
[46:46] all down around their knees and stuff
[46:47] that shows something might have changed
[46:49] them
[46:49] a young man going around with their hair
[46:50] hanging all down in their eyes
[46:52] that shows something hasn't changed them
[46:54] but let the holy ghost
[46:55] get a hold of that person and something
[46:57] will something will have an effect
[46:59] it will have an effect on that person's
[47:01] life
[47:05] see now brother braham said in ephesians
[47:09] chapter 1 and verse 5
[47:11] having predestinated us having
[47:13] predestinated us unto the adoption of
[47:15] children by jesus christ to himself
[47:17] according to the good pleasure of his
[47:18] will
[47:19] and now that's where brother brown
[47:21] begins to talk about how now you've got
[47:23] now you're born again but you're
[47:25] actually predestinated to something
[47:27] and and to really understand what he's
[47:29] talking about in the rest of this sermon
[47:31] you really have to understand what
[47:33] predestination is
[47:34] and that's why he starts and thank god
[47:37] we've got the
[47:38] background here and brother dale's been
[47:39] hammering on what predestination is
[47:41] and i think it should really be soaked
[47:43] down in our minds but let's just do a
[47:45] little quick review now brother brown
[47:47] said
[47:47] if you go on wikipedia and look at what
[47:49] the prophet said the the wikipedia
[47:51] article for brother brown
[47:52] will say that brother branham was a
[47:54] staunch calvinist
[47:56] is that right yeah let's read this quote
[48:00] and see if that's right
[48:02] and brother ram said now i realize that
[48:04] i'm talking to both calvinist and
[48:05] armenians
[48:06] and i'm a calvinist as long as calvin
[48:09] stays in the bible
[48:10] then after that i'm an armenian i
[48:14] believe
[48:14] in the grace of god to keep the believer
[48:16] but i believe the believer has to have
[48:18] enough grace of god to stay with god
[48:20] in other words if you understand
[48:22] predestination correctly
[48:23] you can say well you're predestinated
[48:25] for this you're predestinated for that
[48:26] but
[48:27] you got you got a part to play in this
[48:30] and you know the way that the gospel is
[48:32] preached so many times
[48:33] it's almost confusing wording how
[48:35] brother branham would say that god chose
[48:36] you you didn't chose him
[48:38] now what's he saying he's saying that
[48:40] there you are in your house and you're
[48:41] there behind the door
[48:43] and you didn't go out of your door to go
[48:45] hunt for him
[48:46] he came to your door he came to your
[48:50] dwelling place
[48:51] and there you are behind the door like
[48:53] that painting where the doorknob is on
[48:55] the inside of the door
[48:56] and you're the one that has to open up
[48:58] the door and so
[49:00] god chose you you didn't choose him
[49:04] he came to your house and knocked on
[49:07] your door
[49:08] you didn't go to his house and knock on
[49:10] his door cause you didn't know like
[49:12] martin luther said you didn't without
[49:13] the holy ghost you would know nothing
[49:14] about god
[49:15] how would you know how how would you
[49:17] even know what you're looking for
[49:18] but when the gospel came it was the door
[49:21] knocking on your heart when you heard
[49:23] the gospel it's
[49:24] it's god knocking on the door of your
[49:26] heart and he's
[49:27] he's coming for you he's coming for why
[49:29] because he knew
[49:30] whether or not you would respond
[49:34] so you make it when you make it so much
[49:37] like you're just being pushed through a
[49:38] tube
[49:39] that's you
[49:44] that's that's you wanting god to force
[49:46] you yeah
[49:47] and what kind of a love relationship
[49:49] with that is would that be
[49:51] now speak get a little bit carnal here
[49:52] for a second what kind of a relationship
[49:54] what kind of a matrimonial relationship
[49:56] would it be for a husband to just
[49:58] knock his wife over the head like a
[50:00] caveman and grab drag her off to his
[50:02] cave and say i'm gonna force you to
[50:04] marry me
[50:04] i'm gonna force you that's the way that
[50:06] a lot of people believe predestination
[50:08] but god doesn't force anybody to love
[50:10] him
[50:10] that's the only way that god can
[50:12] actually manifest his love
[50:14] is to allow you to be able to respond if
[50:17] he didn't allow you give you the ability
[50:19] to open up the door
[50:20] and let him in then he becomes like a
[50:23] man just knocking a girl over the head
[50:25] with a with a
[50:26] club and dragging her off to his cave
[50:28] and he's forcing her
[50:29] and listen i'm not preaching a gospel of
[50:31] rape i'm preaching the gospel of love
[50:34] god wants you to love him back that's
[50:36] what brother ram tells in this whole
[50:37] story he will
[50:38] it's a love relationship the reason that
[50:40] pentecost failed was because they got
[50:42] out of love with jesus christ
[50:44] the reason that the ephesians church
[50:45] failed was because they forgot their
[50:47] first love
[50:48] it's because they got out of love the
[50:50] the bible the whole christian experience
[50:52] is based on love
[50:53] not forcing you know really really you
[50:56] can't you can't we
[50:57] we'll cry against people coming to
[50:59] church and cry against all kinds of
[51:01] things
[51:01] but it's got to be a love relationship
[51:03] you're not you're not going to come to
[51:05] church
[51:05] every service until you begin to fall in
[51:07] love with jesus christ
[51:08] you're not going to get on your bed at
[51:10] night and pray and read your bible every
[51:12] morning until you begin to fall in love
[51:13] with jesus christ
[51:15] and so that's what i believe that the
[51:16] gospel has sent to get you to fall in
[51:18] love with jesus christ because it won't
[51:20] work if you're not
[51:21] in love with jesus christ the whole
[51:23] story won't work
[51:24] if you're not in love and when you take
[51:26] love out then then what you're left with
[51:29] as a predestination doctrine based on
[51:31] force
[51:31] you're not forced into this god doesn't
[51:34] force nobody
[51:35] he's a gentleman brother brown said
[51:36] he'll come to you he'll he'll come
[51:38] and maybe he'll come to the doors of the
[51:40] church and if he doesn't feel welcome
[51:41] he'll just walk
[51:42] go right back away he'll come to the
[51:44] door of your heart and if you don't
[51:46] welcome him in
[51:47] he's a gentleman he's not going to force
[51:48] his way in he's not going to stick his
[51:50] foot through the door
[51:51] he'll turn and he'll go away maybe he'll
[51:53] come back again a week later or so and
[51:55] he'll keep knocking
[51:56] he'll keep knocking until finally your
[51:58] heart gets so hard that you say i don't
[52:00] want to let him in and he that's that'll
[52:01] be the last time
[52:03] because he's a gentleman god is a
[52:05] gentleman do you see why the
[52:06] predestination doctrine the wrong way
[52:08] is so wrong because you make god
[52:11] a forcer that he's forcing you to have a
[52:13] relationship with him
[52:15] god will never force you to have a
[52:16] relationship with him
[52:20] god wants you to love him the reason he
[52:23] came to your door is because he knows
[52:25] if you will yield yourself to his word
[52:27] he knows listen he knows whether you
[52:29] will prefer the word
[52:31] or just a sensation on your flesh he
[52:34] knows
[52:34] how far you will go he knows in advance
[52:37] and that's how he can predestinate it
[52:39] god knows
[52:40] if he has your heart or not tonight now
[52:43] think about that he knows right now if
[52:45] he
[52:45] really has your heart if you're just
[52:47] kind of going through the motions the
[52:48] dead works coming to church
[52:50] it's just all dead to you but when god
[52:52] raises something inside of you
[52:53] when you read easter morning when that
[52:56] word comes to life
[52:57] then it becomes not dead works anymore
[52:59] but he's got your heart
[53:01] and it becomes a love relationship
[53:04] brother adam said if your mind and heart
[53:07] and all
[53:08] doesn't agree with god's word and
[53:10] believe that he's the same
[53:11] lord jesus resurrected from the dead and
[53:14] peace in your heart and yet you belong
[53:16] to church be careful
[53:18] you might have a perverted mind instead
[53:20] of it being a changed heart
[53:24] brother brahman said that's stiff and
[53:25] it's hard but it's good
[53:31] so what god is after you see what god is
[53:33] after is a heart
[53:34] that will follow god that's where
[53:37] pentecost failed
[53:38] a heart that will keep following god
[53:41] brother ramon said then luther being
[53:42] god's man of the hour come out to bring
[53:44] the message it was a type of
[53:45] in the wilderness israel had a pillar of
[53:47] fire a pillar of fire and they followed
[53:49] it day and night and when that pillar of
[53:51] fire stopped
[53:52] israel camped under that fire that light
[53:54] and they stayed there until the pillar
[53:56] of fire moved on
[53:57] and israel moved with the fire and as he
[53:59] did in the natural for israel he's done
[54:02] in the spiritual for the church
[54:03] so when the holy ghost moves you had
[54:05] better move with it
[54:07] and it moved where did it move from
[54:09] luther to wesley
[54:11] to pentecost so there you can see that
[54:13] the same way pentecost fails
[54:15] it's the same way that the lutherans or
[54:17] when they organized and did not move on
[54:19] to wesley
[54:20] they failed when wesley did not move on
[54:23] to pentecost
[54:24] they failed when they denominated and
[54:26] said now we got it and they settled down
[54:28] and said well we got it we're not going
[54:29] to move on and they failed and so
[54:31] pentecost failed
[54:32] because they failed to move on and
[54:34] brother adam said there was a group of
[54:36] people
[54:36] a group of people that call themselves
[54:39] pentecost
[54:40] now if you really study the message out
[54:42] you'll find out that brother branham
[54:43] doesn't even refer
[54:44] to what we believe as pentecostal and
[54:47] well i'll get that in a little bit
[54:49] we'll just put that over on the shelf
[54:50] for a little bit brother brown said
[54:52] there was a group of people
[54:53] a group of people that called themselves
[54:56] pentecost
[54:57] they saw the pillar of fire and received
[55:00] the holy ghost
[55:01] they received the holy ghost they
[55:03] actually yes sir
[55:04] and receive the gifts of the spirit
[55:07] speaking in tongues
[55:08] and so forth but what did the devil do
[55:10] he come along and made them organized
[55:12] and they began to organize and draw
[55:14] fences and lines and you know what
[55:17] they just got so organized that they
[55:19] could not move with it
[55:21] in other words they settled for what
[55:23] they had
[55:25] they settled they so if you look at
[55:28] where pentecost failed
[55:29] and avoid that same situation don't
[55:32] settle for what you have
[55:34] now you've been born again now you've
[55:36] been you you've received the word
[55:38] uh you you've received enough word to be
[55:41] born again don't settle but just keep
[55:43] moving on and keep packing it in
[55:45] because where that came from there's
[55:48] more to be had
[55:49] there's more to be had where that came
[55:51] from
[55:52] brother brahma says we must not draw
[55:54] boundary lines we must say
[55:56] we believe this not end with a period
[55:58] but with a comma we believe this
[56:00] plutch plus as much as god will pour
[56:03] into our hearts
[56:07] i'm telling you this is where people
[56:08] fail at i i know from personal
[56:11] experience this is where people
[56:13] looking at people's lives my own my own
[56:16] experience
[56:17] looking at things this is where people
[56:18] fail at
[56:21] the brother braham said keep adding look
[56:23] at when elijah found elijah and told him
[56:25] to walk with him and then he said you
[56:26] tara here
[56:27] you terry elijah told elijah you wait
[56:30] here you wait here
[56:32] for i must go to another city do you
[56:35] think elisha was going to do that
[56:37] what if an angel from heaven told you
[56:39] you just stay right here at the new
[56:40] birth and don't go anywhere don't keep
[56:42] going on don't keep seeking god but he
[56:44] kept going on and elisha brother baby
[56:45] said elisha the prophet that was to take
[56:47] his place said
[56:48] as the lord liveth and thy soul liveth
[56:50] i'll not
[56:51] leave thee because elisha did not settle
[56:54] he was not satisfied with his present
[56:56] location that he went on to the next
[56:58] stopping point
[57:01] brother ram said now then he said i go
[57:03] up to the school of prophets
[57:04] the second journey he said you stay here
[57:07] but elisha said as your soul liveth i'll
[57:09] not leave you
[57:10] i'll not i'm not staying right here i'm
[57:12] going to keep going on
[57:13] now you see that god has given you
[57:15] stopping off points
[57:16] stop enough points to see if you're
[57:18] going to stay there if you're going to
[57:19] keep going
[57:20] you get to justification you go on the
[57:22] sanctification you go on to the baptism
[57:24] in the holy ghost the
[57:25] the word of the spirit quickening the
[57:26] word that you've held and now you're
[57:27] born again are you going to stop there
[57:29] or are you going to keep going on i
[57:31] believe that's one of the purposes of
[57:33] the message that brother brown brought
[57:34] to us is to
[57:35] to reveal to us that there's more to be
[57:37] had
[57:39] y'all excuse me he said you stay here
[57:42] but elisha said as your soul liveth i'll
[57:44] not leave you and he went on and when he
[57:46] got to the school of the prophets he
[57:47] said
[57:48] i crossed jordan he said you stay here
[57:50] he said as thy soul liveth i'll not stay
[57:52] here i'll go with you a determination to
[57:55] hold on
[57:56] regardless of the price move on brother
[57:58] brahma said
[57:59] keep going on with god deeper waters
[58:02] deeper experiences more love he said
[58:05] there's no
[58:06] limit to it it's unlimited how many
[58:08] times did brother brown say it's
[58:10] unlimited
[58:10] there's no limit to it it's unlimited
[58:13] you may keep moving into deeper and
[58:15] deeper experiences
[58:16] with god what where the word keeps
[58:18] opening up and what is it doing
[58:20] it's giving you confidence and what you
[58:22] have access to
[58:23] confidence that you've got access to the
[58:25] bank account why because you know what's
[58:27] in the bank account
[58:28] and you know how it works you know how
[58:30] you were born again you know what the
[58:31] spirit does
[58:32] you know what the word does you know the
[58:34] effect the spirit has on the word and
[58:36] you know how it all fits together
[58:37] and that's giving you confidence and
[58:39] ability to with making that withdrawal
[58:41] from that bank account
[58:44] and brother brown said now at the jordan
[58:46] representing death
[58:47] he come these other two places not death
[58:49] connected with it
[58:51] and then when he come to jordan
[58:52] representing death that you have to die
[58:54] out and then when he crossed jordan he
[58:56] got on the other side he turned to him
[58:58] and he said
[58:58] now what will you do that i do for you
[59:02] he wasn't backward he said that a double
[59:04] portion of your spirit come upon me
[59:06] and elijah said if you see me when i go
[59:08] away you shall have it
[59:09] in other words if you keep your eyes on
[59:11] me you shall have it
[59:13] and that's the way any belief that you
[59:14] know that's the way you preach the
[59:15] gospel
[59:16] you preach the gospel but not by looking
[59:18] at people's reactions and listening to
[59:20] the things that people say
[59:21] but you preached your gospel the gospel
[59:23] about just looking at christ and just
[59:24] pressing onward that's the way you live
[59:26] as a christian
[59:27] it doesn't matter what people say about
[59:28] you listen when you you take that first
[59:30] step as a born-again
[59:32] believer and right out of the gate
[59:34] people are going to be saying stuff
[59:35] about you and
[59:36] well you must have drunk something the
[59:37] way you shouted or whatever
[59:39] you know something must have been done
[59:40] to you the way you acted or whatever you
[59:42] acted a little bit different you look
[59:43] like an oddball
[59:44] but you got to ignore the things that
[59:46] people say about you
[59:48] people are going to talk people are
[59:49] going to laugh and point and stare
[59:51] but you got to ignore the naysayers and
[59:53] just keep your eyes
[59:54] right on the word and brother brahma
[59:56] said if you're really born of god it
[59:59] don't make any difference what the world
[1:00:00] says or what anybody else says you know
[1:00:03] where you stand and all devils in hell
[1:00:04] can't upset you
[1:00:06] then you prove it by your fruits not by
[1:00:08] your voice but by your life
[1:00:10] you live the right kind of a life a life
[1:00:12] that's not unsettled by
[1:00:14] things that people say about you there's
[1:00:15] a life that gets your head so far into
[1:00:18] the holy of holies that it doesn't
[1:00:19] matter what's going on outside and
[1:00:21] you're not listening to the naysayers
[1:00:23] and the other people you're not looking
[1:00:24] at the people that the other christians
[1:00:26] that have fallen by the wayside you're
[1:00:27] not looking at the other ministers they
[1:00:29] have not done the way that you thought
[1:00:30] they should
[1:00:31] but you you're just pressing on to the
[1:00:33] mark of the high calling in christ
[1:00:38] and brother brown said now when the
[1:00:40] pentecostal people and the free
[1:00:41] methodists and baptists and so forth
[1:00:43] when they received the holy spirit they
[1:00:44] said we got it
[1:00:46] we got it now that settles it and
[1:00:49] there's where they fail
[1:00:50] right we got it that settles it and
[1:00:52] isn't that what so many people in the
[1:00:54] message today believe that when you get
[1:00:55] the born
[1:00:56] when you're born again that settles it
[1:00:58] and that is so
[1:00:59] contrary to the message that brother
[1:01:01] branham brought
[1:01:05] you know maybe maybe some things that i
[1:01:07] the way that i preach and the way that i
[1:01:09] do is a little bit backwards or whatever
[1:01:10] but if the
[1:01:11] my ultimate goal and my motive is to get
[1:01:13] people to go back
[1:01:14] and listen to the to what brother
[1:01:16] branham actually said because if you'll
[1:01:18] do that it will change your life
[1:01:19] one of my kids i'm gonna share this
[1:01:21] little story anonymously one of my kids
[1:01:22] was talking to some friends that they
[1:01:24] had
[1:01:24] and they were they were struggling with
[1:01:26] whether or not they should actually go
[1:01:27] to a church that believes in the
[1:01:28] fivefold ministry
[1:01:29] and for a while they were going to a
[1:01:30] tape a tape only church
[1:01:32] and then all of a sudden out of the blue
[1:01:34] it changed and they started going
[1:01:36] to a church with a with an actual live
[1:01:38] living pastor
[1:01:40] and so one of my kids was asking well
[1:01:42] what changed what happened and they said
[1:01:44] we actually started listening to the
[1:01:45] tapes
[1:01:47] we actually started reading what brother
[1:01:49] branham said
[1:01:50] because when you actually start reading
[1:01:52] what brother branham said it will change
[1:01:54] you
[1:01:56] it makes a difference when you actually
[1:01:58] and so many times
[1:02:00] like brother dale was bringing out this
[1:02:01] morning we'll take somebody somebody
[1:02:02] what somebody else says for granted
[1:02:04] but i want you to not even take what i'm
[1:02:06] saying for granted
[1:02:07] don't take what the ministry is saying
[1:02:09] for granted but go find out for yourself
[1:02:11] like the bereans did and they poured
[1:02:13] through the scriptures and found out for
[1:02:14] themselves
[1:02:15] what was said and and something
[1:02:17] something will open up to you
[1:02:19] if you'll do that
[1:02:23] the method has said brother brother
[1:02:24] brother brown when we shout we had it
[1:02:26] that's what the messages used to say
[1:02:28] every methodist would shout brother you
[1:02:29] got it but they found out they didn't
[1:02:31] have it the pentecost said when they
[1:02:32] spoke with tongues
[1:02:33] we got it but you found out you didn't
[1:02:34] that's right life proves it seeing
[1:02:36] people speak with tongues like pouring
[1:02:37] peas on a dry cowhide and go out and
[1:02:39] cheat and steal and lie and everything
[1:02:41] else
[1:02:41] you can't call that the holy spirit but
[1:02:43] now wait i believe
[1:02:44] and i believe in shouting speaking in
[1:02:47] tongues brother around said
[1:02:48] but i'm trying to place something in you
[1:02:51] in other words he's trying to take those
[1:02:53] pentecostal people
[1:02:54] and give them some fundamentals so they
[1:02:56] know what they stand for
[1:02:58] but we believe in shouting we believe in
[1:03:01] running the house
[1:03:02] we believe in the holy ghost actually
[1:03:04] having an effect in you
[1:03:05] yes we do we believe in that we believe
[1:03:07] in the holy ghost moving on people
[1:03:09] we believe in a rushing mighty wind
[1:03:11] coming through and sweeping through we
[1:03:12] believe in it
[1:03:13] but we also believe in knowing what you
[1:03:15] believe
[1:03:16] and knowing what you stand for
[1:03:19] now listen listen as he was preaching
[1:03:21] this i'm telling you
[1:03:23] this kind of topic will stir people up
[1:03:26] and it stirred people up then when
[1:03:27] brother branham was saying this and he
[1:03:28] said you may be mad at me now
[1:03:31] but you won't be up there you may be mad
[1:03:34] at me now
[1:03:36] isn't that funny how so often the gospel
[1:03:38] will get people mad
[1:03:39] it will cause a reaction we were
[1:03:41] actually talking on the way up to church
[1:03:42] this morning
[1:03:43] about people that we had witnessed over
[1:03:45] through the years that would sit under
[1:03:46] the preaching of the gospel
[1:03:47] and when the word is being preached
[1:03:49] about how you need to come to church or
[1:03:50] or whatever it is people go on and they
[1:03:52] it actually causes a physical reaction
[1:03:54] that you can sit there in church and
[1:03:56] look over and see them
[1:03:57] official and they just can't sit still
[1:03:59] something something's taking place and
[1:04:00] then they come out of church says i'm
[1:04:02] never coming back here
[1:04:03] i know why because it caused a reaction
[1:04:05] something actually took place
[1:04:07] you see when you're going through a
[1:04:08] sanctified condition you begin you might
[1:04:10] get offended when the word
[1:04:12] is actually honing in on something in
[1:04:13] your life and it will actually
[1:04:15] cause a reaction people will bend over
[1:04:18] in their seats and act like they're
[1:04:19] asleep and just lean over against the
[1:04:20] wall and all kinds of stuff because it's
[1:04:22] actually causing a reaction you can see
[1:04:24] on people's faces many times when you're
[1:04:26] preaching
[1:04:27] you know i got to listen the other day
[1:04:29] to the message the forgotten beatitude
[1:04:31] and i would encourage you to go back and
[1:04:32] listen to that
[1:04:33] i want to remind you what the forgotten
[1:04:35] beatitude is
[1:04:37] when when jesus preached on the mount of
[1:04:38] olives he preached all the beating
[1:04:40] blessed are the hunger and they that
[1:04:41] hunger and thirst for righteousness
[1:04:42] blessed are the meek blessed all those
[1:04:44] kind of things
[1:04:44] but there was one that he didn't preach
[1:04:46] until he went over to john
[1:04:48] who was down there john the baptist who
[1:04:50] was down there in prison
[1:04:51] and he preached he just let loose with
[1:04:53] that forgotten beatitude
[1:04:55] blessed are those that are not offended
[1:04:58] in me
[1:04:59] blessed is he whosoever shall not be
[1:05:01] offended in me
[1:05:02] because so many times the word that when
[1:05:04] the word is being preached it causes an
[1:05:06] offense
[1:05:07] and somebody will be sitting there
[1:05:08] thinking well that that what's that
[1:05:10] minister got against me
[1:05:12] when actually you're just reading
[1:05:13] through quotes was it what what's what's
[1:05:14] brother wade or brother dale or whoever
[1:05:16] or what they got against me who's been
[1:05:18] talking around behind my back
[1:05:20] but it's the word that's actually being
[1:05:22] compared up against your life
[1:05:23] it's the minister holding the word up
[1:05:25] against your life and saying
[1:05:27] something don't match the minister don't
[1:05:29] even know it doesn't match but you there
[1:05:31] sitting there being offended something
[1:05:34] is something that's vibrating
[1:05:35] differently than the frequency of the
[1:05:36] word
[1:05:37] something is off you see the word that's
[1:05:39] why the bible says
[1:05:41] wheresoever also it is contained in the
[1:05:42] scripture behold i lay in zion
[1:05:45] a chief cornerstone elect precious and
[1:05:47] he that believeth on him shall not be
[1:05:49] confounded
[1:05:50] unto you therefore which believe he is
[1:05:51] precious but unto them which be
[1:05:53] disobedient
[1:05:54] the stone which this what's the builders
[1:05:56] disallowed the same is made the head of
[1:05:58] the corner and a stone
[1:06:00] of stumbling a stone of stumbling and a
[1:06:03] rock of offense
[1:06:04] even to them which stumble at the word
[1:06:06] being disobedient
[1:06:07] whereunto also they were appointed
[1:06:09] because the word
[1:06:10] you do you realize what the word is
[1:06:12] actually doing it is as it's being
[1:06:14] preached
[1:06:15] the word is actually trying to place you
[1:06:18] and we a lot of times are resistant to
[1:06:20] being placed
[1:06:22] isn't that what brother brown said that
[1:06:23] ephesian church was all about
[1:06:25] placing after they after they got
[1:06:26] through all their corinthian nonsense
[1:06:28] the little baby nonsense
[1:06:29] of play time now it's time to be placed
[1:06:32] and as the word is going forth the word
[1:06:35] is putting you in your place
[1:06:37] where the word says brother brown will
[1:06:38] say a woman's place is in the kitchen
[1:06:40] and it's placing you where if you're in
[1:06:42] your place now
[1:06:44] now see now we're getting where the
[1:06:45] rubber meets the road if you're in your
[1:06:47] place you'll be matching up with the
[1:06:48] word brother ram will tell you
[1:06:49] the bible tells you how to dress and how
[1:06:52] to live and how to do
[1:06:53] that a woman has to has to have her hair
[1:06:56] uncut though a woman is supposed to be
[1:06:59] wearing dresses
[1:07:00] and and not looking like a man and see
[1:07:02] that begins to place you when you line
[1:07:04] up
[1:07:04] with the word the word is actually
[1:07:07] placing you
[1:07:08] amen and as you continually grow the
[1:07:10] word the more word you hear
[1:07:12] the word is placing you it's putting you
[1:07:14] in your place
[1:07:15] and you are submissive to the word and
[1:07:17] you're allowing yourself to be placed to
[1:07:19] be put in your place
[1:07:21] just like what do you think this is this
[1:07:23] pyramid
[1:07:24] it had all these stones in it and there
[1:07:26] was a stone mason that would
[1:07:28] hew out the stone and put it in his
[1:07:29] place it would hew out the stone and
[1:07:31] place it and how are you placed the same
[1:07:34] way
[1:07:34] by the hewing of the word that word is
[1:07:37] hewing you and placing you
[1:07:38] exactly where he wants you to be right
[1:07:42] you know i think we get confused about
[1:07:43] that sometimes we want we want a big job
[1:07:46] i want a big job and then i'll be placed
[1:07:49] your job your role is to be placed by
[1:07:51] the word
[1:07:52] to do what the word wants you to do for
[1:07:54] that age
[1:07:55] and the words see so many times we
[1:07:57] resist how are you going to come to the
[1:07:59] adoption how are you going to come to
[1:08:00] adoption if you won't allow the word to
[1:08:02] place you
[1:08:03] to put you in the building to allow the
[1:08:05] stonemason to positionally place you and
[1:08:07] put you
[1:08:08] right into the slot where you're
[1:08:09] supposed to go and if there's a little
[1:08:10] bump hanging off
[1:08:12] you don't want you don't want that
[1:08:13] little bump to be chopped off and
[1:08:14] chiseled
[1:08:15] so that you can slot into place but
[1:08:17] allow god's word to just knock that off
[1:08:19] and you'll slide
[1:08:20] right into your place and listen a lot
[1:08:22] of times a lot of the times the things
[1:08:24] that brother branham said are hard to
[1:08:26] understand
[1:08:26] and hard to it's easy to resist but if
[1:08:29] you'll just
[1:08:30] yield yourself to it allow god to have
[1:08:33] preeminence in
[1:08:34] your life it's it's actually allowing
[1:08:36] yourself to be placed
[1:08:40] see we come to church we're not we're
[1:08:42] not we're not trying to make people mad
[1:08:44] or trying to preach things controversial
[1:08:46] we're trying to get a church to a place
[1:08:48] a place of placing where you can be
[1:08:50] placed a place where god can look at
[1:08:52] your conduct and the way that you act in
[1:08:54] the way that you behave and say
[1:08:56] that person is in their place they're
[1:08:58] placed
[1:08:59] i have placed them by my word and
[1:09:01] they're doing exactly what i want them
[1:09:03] to do
[1:09:03] they're matching up with the word for
[1:09:05] their age
[1:09:08] oh my the clock's skipping ahead let me
[1:09:11] just skip through
[1:09:11] some of this you know
[1:09:15] but seriously though if you analyze your
[1:09:17] own self
[1:09:18] most problems in the world today most
[1:09:21] problems at your work
[1:09:22] most problems in your relationship with
[1:09:24] your spouse start by somebody being
[1:09:26] offended
[1:09:27] and if you just lay like now it's like
[1:09:29] beginning to dawn on me why all these
[1:09:31] years brother dale was just saying
[1:09:32] sit on your feelings just sit on your
[1:09:35] feelings because that can solve a lot of
[1:09:36] problems if you'll just
[1:09:37] sit on your feelings and allow yourself
[1:09:40] to be molded by the word of god
[1:09:42] sit on your feelings and somebody else
[1:09:44] is being being
[1:09:45] being molded by the word and just sit on
[1:09:48] your feelings for a little bit
[1:09:50] most of the problems most problems start
[1:09:52] by being offended
[1:09:53] and being offended is your enemy because
[1:09:55] what is it it's
[1:09:56] being offended comes from you wanting to
[1:09:58] be treated a certain
[1:10:00] special way i want to be treated some
[1:10:02] some way that i feel like i deserve to
[1:10:05] be treated
[1:10:06] i deserve to be treated better than i'm
[1:10:08] being treated and then we get offended
[1:10:10] and most of the times most of the times
[1:10:12] we'll get offended when the truth is
[1:10:13] coming across
[1:10:18] that's all right and that's the reason
[1:10:22] why i'm kind of saying all this is
[1:10:23] because so many people have become
[1:10:25] offended
[1:10:26] by people saying that pentecost has
[1:10:28] failed like a preacher i'm not gonna
[1:10:30] name names or anything but i heard a
[1:10:31] preacher that
[1:10:32] preached uh fantastic one of the most
[1:10:34] admire one of the ministers i most
[1:10:36] admire in the message preached a sermon
[1:10:38] about this
[1:10:38] and it caused so much confusion about he
[1:10:40] he doesn't believe that pentecost he
[1:10:42] doesn't believe in a new birth no that's
[1:10:44] not when we when you when a minister
[1:10:45] says we've got to go beyond pentecost
[1:10:48] he's saying we've got to go to the
[1:10:50] maturity of the word
[1:10:51] to go past go to adoption he's not
[1:10:54] saying we don't believe
[1:10:55] in the baptism the holy ghost the moving
[1:10:56] of the spirit and all those things
[1:10:58] but when you say somebody somebody else
[1:11:00] said i'm bringing up all these
[1:11:02] conversations
[1:11:03] don't you love it when ministers do that
[1:11:05] and i talked to this brother and he said
[1:11:06] this and i said that
[1:11:09] but somebody said why why haven't i ever
[1:11:11] heard somebody else preach this
[1:11:13] well maybe your ears are stopped to it
[1:11:15] maybe you need to listen to the
[1:11:17] go back and listen to what brother
[1:11:18] branham actually said and it will up
[1:11:19] pull the stoppers out of your ears
[1:11:21] because brother branham did say
[1:11:23] that we've got to come to adoption
[1:11:24] that's the whole point
[1:11:26] of his message was bringing a bride to
[1:11:28] maturity
[1:11:29] so that he could point to the skies at a
[1:11:31] world born bride
[1:11:32] that's coming to maturity the purpose
[1:11:35] the purpose somebody else said
[1:11:36] so i was i was talking to a minister
[1:11:38] when i sat in his house and i sat in his
[1:11:40] house and we talked about
[1:11:41] the purpose of the five full ministry
[1:11:43] and he began to say well i believe that
[1:11:44] a ministry is just
[1:11:46] just to get people born again and get
[1:11:47] them to a place where they need to
[1:11:48] repent and then after that they just go
[1:11:50] home and
[1:11:51] listen to the tapes and it's kind of in
[1:11:52] other words it's all up to them
[1:11:54] and i said well that sounds contrary to
[1:11:57] ephesians chapter four
[1:11:59] where it says he gave some apostles
[1:12:01] prophets and some evangelists
[1:12:03] some pastors and teachers for the
[1:12:05] perfecting of the saints
[1:12:07] now part of that is getting you born
[1:12:09] again but there's more than born again
[1:12:12] there's more than being born again
[1:12:14] you've got to come to perfection
[1:12:17] and it says for the perfecting of the
[1:12:19] saints for the work of the ministry for
[1:12:20] the edifying of the body of christ
[1:12:22] till we all come in the unity of the
[1:12:24] faith
[1:12:25] and of the knowledge of the son of god
[1:12:27] unto a perfect man
[1:12:29] under the measure of the stature of the
[1:12:30] fullness of christ and that's where we
[1:12:32] get the statute of a perfect man because
[1:12:33] paul said it
[1:12:34] until we to a perfect man a perfect man
[1:12:37] which is christ
[1:12:38] unto the measure of the stature of the
[1:12:40] fullness of christ that we're being
[1:12:41] molded up until
[1:12:43] until christ is actually formed in us
[1:12:46] actually represented in us back again
[1:12:49] and that's what the minis that's what
[1:12:50] the five full ministry is for not just
[1:12:52] not to just get people to the altar but
[1:12:54] actually to bring us to
[1:12:56] adoption to a place of adoption
[1:13:00] and that's why in romans chapter eight
[1:13:03] now listen if you go back and read
[1:13:04] romans chapter eight it will parallel
[1:13:05] those three stages of elijah
[1:13:07] three stages of alive elijah are you
[1:13:09] gonna are you gonna stop here
[1:13:10] at being born again are you gonna stop
[1:13:13] here at a stash of a perfect man are you
[1:13:15] gonna stop here
[1:13:16] and you just keep going on are you going
[1:13:18] to stop
[1:13:19] are you no i'm not going to stop and
[1:13:21] romans chapter 8 verses 15 says for you
[1:13:24] have
[1:13:24] ye have not received the spirit of
[1:13:25] bondage again to fear but ye have
[1:13:27] received the spirit of adoption
[1:13:29] whereby we cry abba father so you come
[1:13:33] forth looking at your father and you
[1:13:35] continue growing but that's not the end
[1:13:36] of the story for the earnest expectation
[1:13:39] of the creature waiteth for the
[1:13:40] manifestation of the sons of god
[1:13:42] the creature is waiting what creature
[1:13:45] every creature
[1:13:46] the whole earth the whole urchin is
[1:13:47] waiting for the manifestation of the
[1:13:49] sons of god
[1:13:51] and that's why the five-fold minister
[1:13:52] the father ministry is to preach
[1:13:54] you need to grow you need
[1:13:57] something else don't settle at just the
[1:14:00] baptism of the holy ghost
[1:14:02] don't settle there's more where that
[1:14:04] came from and romans 8 23 and not only
[1:14:06] they but ourselves also which have the
[1:14:08] first fruits of the spirit even we
[1:14:09] ourselves grown
[1:14:10] within ourselves waiting for the
[1:14:12] adoption to wit the redemption of our
[1:14:14] body
[1:14:14] waiting for it there's more to come
[1:14:17] there's more to come
[1:14:18] so don't settle and and this was
[1:14:22] this is what brother brother dale was
[1:14:23] mentioning outside when we were talking
[1:14:25] about how the romans and i was being
[1:14:27] quiet
[1:14:27] because i had it in my nose but the
[1:14:29] romans
[1:14:30] the jews were you know we're looking at
[1:14:32] the romans that they're at their at
[1:14:33] their ceremonies and everything and i
[1:14:35] actually
[1:14:35] i went on the internet and found the
[1:14:37] ceremony of adoption
[1:14:38] this book called the story of civil
[1:14:40] civilization now i know y'all getting
[1:14:42] tired just hang with me just a few more
[1:14:44] minutes
[1:14:45] the romans actually this is the the way
[1:14:47] that the romans did it and
[1:14:49] the book called the story of
[1:14:50] civilization vol 3 caesar in christ
[1:14:53] and it says during a boy's teen years
[1:14:55] his father would determine when it was
[1:14:57] time for him to pass from childhood to
[1:14:58] adulthood
[1:15:00] the father would determine when it was
[1:15:02] time
[1:15:03] to pass from childhood to adulthood now
[1:15:06] this is a roman
[1:15:07] a roman father a roman citizen and
[1:15:10] typically around 14
[1:15:12] or a little later in a formal public
[1:15:15] ceremony
[1:15:16] a formal public ceremony having put us
[1:15:19] why is it public because everybody can
[1:15:22] see the change in your life
[1:15:24] everybody can now it's not gonna be that
[1:15:26] you see like you have a voice every year
[1:15:28] or whatever all this big big to-do or
[1:15:30] whatever
[1:15:30] but it's public because everybody knows
[1:15:33] something happened
[1:15:34] right everybody can tell having put
[1:15:37] aside his
[1:15:38] childhood toga
[1:15:43] the toga you got at your birth
[1:15:46] and put us out now we're not we're not
[1:15:48] getting rid of the baptism the holy
[1:15:49] ghost
[1:15:50] but it's it's unfolding into something
[1:15:52] greater
[1:15:53] it's more of it right having put aside
[1:15:56] his childhood together he would appear
[1:15:59] in the toga varilus the toga of manhood
[1:16:03] the toga he he got given a new toga
[1:16:06] a different toga now as a christian
[1:16:08] you're not giving a new toga
[1:16:10] it's more of it because now you're
[1:16:12] coming to a place like the
[1:16:14] like the roman the roman child coming to
[1:16:15] a place of authority let's find out what
[1:16:18] kind of authority
[1:16:19] it says a mark of citizenship now he's a
[1:16:22] roman citizen and it has
[1:16:23] access to all the rights of being a
[1:16:26] roman citizen remember how paul
[1:16:27] couldn't be couldn't be killed or
[1:16:29] whatever that when they found out he was
[1:16:30] a roman citizen that oh
[1:16:32] we can't touch you because he was a
[1:16:34] roman citizen
[1:16:35] now when this child comes to a place
[1:16:37] where he is an adult and has access to
[1:16:40] being a roman citizen he's got access to
[1:16:43] that whole
[1:16:44] bank account he's got access to it all
[1:16:47] and his right to now vote
[1:16:50] in the assembly in other words now he's
[1:16:52] got a voice
[1:16:53] he can vote in the assembly when the boy
[1:16:56] was ready the possession to the forum
[1:16:58] began
[1:16:59] the father had gathered his slaves
[1:17:01] freedmen clients
[1:17:02] relatives and friends using all his
[1:17:04] influence to make his son's escort
[1:17:06] numerous and imposing
[1:17:08] here the boy's name was added to the
[1:17:10] list of citizens
[1:17:11] now he's recognized with authority
[1:17:15] as a roman citizen and formal
[1:17:18] congratulations
[1:17:19] were extended finally they all returned
[1:17:22] to the house where the day ended with a
[1:17:24] dinner party
[1:17:25] there was a meal as a as a supper
[1:17:28] given by the father in honor of the new
[1:17:31] roman citizen
[1:17:33] now see a son's status was elevated at
[1:17:35] this point
[1:17:36] he was now legally invested
[1:17:40] with all the rights powers
[1:17:43] and privileges of a son and heir of his
[1:17:47] father
[1:17:47] and of a citizen why why because the
[1:17:50] father his father had
[1:17:52] recognized him characteristics worthy of
[1:17:55] exchanging that childhood toga
[1:17:58] for the toga varilus for the toga of
[1:18:00] manhood
[1:18:02] worthy of giving him access to being a
[1:18:05] roman citizen
[1:18:06] and being recognized as a roman citizen
[1:18:09] now see do you realize when this begins
[1:18:11] to open up to you
[1:18:13] brother brown and christ the mystery of
[1:18:14] god reveal he said the new
[1:18:16] birth is christ is a revelation
[1:18:19] god has revealed to you this great
[1:18:22] mystery
[1:18:22] and that's a new birth this actually
[1:18:25] this actually becomes a birth to you
[1:18:27] that yeah you were born again but now
[1:18:30] you're birthed into the revelation of
[1:18:32] the age
[1:18:32] you're being born into something greater
[1:18:35] you're being born into what god
[1:18:37] wants you to be for this day he's be
[1:18:40] he's birthing you
[1:18:41] into a birth according to malachi 4 5
[1:18:44] 6. like brother brother dale was talking
[1:18:46] about this morning
[1:18:47] birth to end to a place of authority and
[1:18:51] adoption
[1:18:52] where you have access to the bank
[1:18:53] account and you can put your name on the
[1:18:56] checkbook
[1:18:57] just like just right next to jesus
[1:18:59] christ and
[1:19:00] have confidence that the funds will not
[1:19:02] be overdrawn
[1:19:06] y'all doing all right if i go a little
[1:19:07] bit longer
[1:19:11] yo be careful what you ask for or what
[1:19:13] you agree to
[1:19:17] now brother branham i'm really merging
[1:19:19] several sermons
[1:19:20] i'm merging brother brown talks about
[1:19:22] this and and uh
[1:19:24] why where pentecost uh failed and
[1:19:28] uh desperations
[1:19:32] and once more so if you look in the
[1:19:34] sermon once more
[1:19:36] and look in the sermon desperation he
[1:19:38] really begins to nail down
[1:19:39] the reasons why pentecost failed and
[1:19:42] takes a closer look at it and he begins
[1:19:44] to talk about all these old testament
[1:19:46] examples
[1:19:47] that otherwise you would never have
[1:19:48] associated with pentecost failing
[1:19:51] and one of the examples he uses was
[1:19:53] samson there and he
[1:19:54] and the bible says the philistines be
[1:19:56] upon these samson and he wished not
[1:19:58] the lord was departed from him doesn't
[1:20:01] that sound like the pentecostal church
[1:20:02] and that's the example
[1:20:04] that brother brown was using to
[1:20:05] illustrate the pentecostal church and he
[1:20:07] would say now samson
[1:20:08] still had his big big old body and
[1:20:11] that's just one of the only times that i
[1:20:12] found where brother brown referred to
[1:20:13] samson not being a little scrawny fellow
[1:20:15] but having a big body and what point was
[1:20:18] he making the point he was making was
[1:20:20] yeah the pentecostal church is still the
[1:20:22] pentecostal organization
[1:20:24] it's still a big body of members just
[1:20:26] like samson still had his big
[1:20:28] body of his big strong body but yet his
[1:20:32] eyes were poked out right and he began
[1:20:34] to cry out once more you know
[1:20:35] brother brown said samson sampson
[1:20:38] preferred instead of
[1:20:39] following after the word he got all he
[1:20:41] got he he followed after sensations
[1:20:44] he was more interested in delilah he was
[1:20:46] more interested in the
[1:20:47] lust of the flesh and the pride of life
[1:20:49] that he was interested in the word and
[1:20:50] that's where pentecost failed
[1:20:52] and see if you look at that that's where
[1:20:54] you you and i can fail
[1:20:56] if you're so if you're more interested
[1:20:58] in sensations and things of this world
[1:21:00] than the word of god then you'll fail
[1:21:02] and brother i was saying that once
[1:21:04] powerful once powerful at azusa street
[1:21:06] they cut off his seven locks the word
[1:21:08] and they put out his eyesight they
[1:21:09] blinded him to the truth
[1:21:12] they blinded him to the truth so that he
[1:21:13] could not see and brother brown said he
[1:21:16] was raised up for this purpose and
[1:21:18] but where is the word the strength being
[1:21:20] manifested
[1:21:21] it's been cut off from you by your power
[1:21:23] shaving organizations
[1:21:25] he had failed god not only he had he
[1:21:28] failed god
[1:21:29] but he failed his own people he was a
[1:21:32] total failure
[1:21:33] now he was a prisoner to the very nation
[1:21:36] that god
[1:21:37] raised him up to destroy just like
[1:21:38] pentecost became a prisoner
[1:21:40] to the to the roman system to the
[1:21:42] denominational system
[1:21:44] the very thing that it had been raised
[1:21:46] up to destroy and now it became a
[1:21:47] prisoner to that
[1:21:49] now and there's there's sampson a big
[1:21:51] strong
[1:21:52] warrior that now has his eyes blinded
[1:21:54] now let's look at another
[1:21:56] example now this will really get you now
[1:21:59] jacob you know we know the story of how
[1:22:01] jacob
[1:22:01] did everything he could to get the birth
[1:22:03] right he he got that birthright and
[1:22:05] brother brown said
[1:22:07] you know all the different stories and
[1:22:09] things that after the birthright how he
[1:22:11] he impersonated his brother and how he
[1:22:13] he worked all the different years for
[1:22:15] for rachel and leah and finally he come
[1:22:17] to a place
[1:22:18] after he had betrayed after he had he he
[1:22:20] had with his little shyster self he had
[1:22:22] done that to esau
[1:22:24] to get the birthright now he come to a
[1:22:26] place where he realized that he was
[1:22:29] lacking something
[1:22:30] and brother brandon said in genesis
[1:22:31] chapter 32 verses 67 and the messengers
[1:22:34] returned to jacob saying we came to thy
[1:22:37] brother esau
[1:22:38] and also he cometh to meet thee and 400
[1:22:41] men with him
[1:22:42] then jacob was greatly afraid and
[1:22:45] distressed
[1:22:46] because he was afraid that he was going
[1:22:49] to die
[1:22:50] now now he realized that something was
[1:22:53] lacking in his life now
[1:22:54] now when you come now yeah you've got
[1:22:56] you're born again you've got the spirit
[1:22:58] of god in your life
[1:22:59] you're born again but yet you know that
[1:23:01] there's something lacking in your life
[1:23:03] and what that thing is that you're
[1:23:05] lacking is adoption is the token
[1:23:07] the token life now brother brown i'm
[1:23:10] i'm getting into another message let me
[1:23:12] i'm gonna get too complicated
[1:23:15] now brother brown said in the message
[1:23:17] desperations he said he thought in his
[1:23:19] own mind that he knew
[1:23:20] that the birthright meant to him meant
[1:23:22] everything to him and he didn't care how
[1:23:24] he had to get it just so he got it
[1:23:26] and after he got it he thought
[1:23:28] everything was all right
[1:23:30] because he had the birthright he thought
[1:23:33] the thing
[1:23:34] was settled jacob thought
[1:23:37] the thing was settled because he had the
[1:23:40] birthright
[1:23:42] now what about what about people in the
[1:23:44] message today
[1:23:46] that they think all the message is is to
[1:23:48] be born again and that's
[1:23:50] it but if you think that you'll fail
[1:23:53] just like jacob did
[1:23:54] like just like just like uh samson did
[1:23:57] just like all these examples just like
[1:23:59] pentecost did
[1:24:00] fail to see that that is not all there
[1:24:03] is
[1:24:05] brother brown said again the next
[1:24:06] paragraph and he said see he didn't care
[1:24:08] how he done it just so he got it the
[1:24:10] birthright and he thought
[1:24:11] when he got the birthright that settled
[1:24:14] it
[1:24:14] pentecost there is where you failed
[1:24:18] you thought because you were born of the
[1:24:20] spirit
[1:24:21] born of the spirit of god the birthright
[1:24:23] that settled it
[1:24:25] but it only starts it amen you remember
[1:24:28] in the message and he goes on talking
[1:24:30] about adoption and he said then if it
[1:24:31] did not prove out to be an obedient
[1:24:32] child of the father's will
[1:24:34] it aired nothing yet it was a son but he
[1:24:36] aired nothing if he wasn't interested in
[1:24:38] the father's work
[1:24:39] and so when the holy ghost fell upon the
[1:24:41] pentecostal people
[1:24:42] and they begin to restore back the gifts
[1:24:44] and things that was in the church
[1:24:46] they thought because they were born of
[1:24:49] the spirit
[1:24:50] that settled it right but you see
[1:24:54] there is a placing of a son brother ram
[1:24:55] said and then there was a placing of the
[1:24:58] sun
[1:24:58] that he had heir of everything the
[1:25:00] father had
[1:25:01] now brother branham he goes on to say
[1:25:03] now jacob thought because he had the
[1:25:05] birthright that everything was made
[1:25:07] so did the pentecostal people when they
[1:25:08] began to organize the oneness threeness
[1:25:10] and trinitarians
[1:25:11] and all kinds of organizations and
[1:25:13] fussing and pulling at one another
[1:25:15] proved that the token wasn't showing
[1:25:18] right now let me call your attention to
[1:25:20] something real quick brother brown
[1:25:21] preached a token
[1:25:22] the evening after he preached the token
[1:25:25] he preached desperations in the evening
[1:25:27] the evening after he preached a token in
[1:25:28] the morning he preached a token in the
[1:25:30] morning
[1:25:31] and then that afternoon he started
[1:25:32] talking about you got to be desperate
[1:25:34] for something
[1:25:35] desperate for what desperation will kick
[1:25:38] in when you realize there's something
[1:25:40] still
[1:25:40] lacking in your life that yeah you've
[1:25:43] been born again but there's still some
[1:25:44] something that you've got to mature into
[1:25:50] brother brown said now we've tried to
[1:25:52] jump the fence we've tried to stick the
[1:25:54] cart before the horse
[1:25:55] you tried to claim things and do things
[1:25:57] before god did it and got a lot of flesh
[1:25:59] worked up into it
[1:26:00] and that's what's the matter with the
[1:26:02] church he said there isn't something
[1:26:04] wrong
[1:26:05] it isn't wrong with god it isn't wrong
[1:26:08] with your faith
[1:26:09] it's being placed right knowing what
[1:26:11] you're doing
[1:26:12] and how to do it that's the secret of
[1:26:14] the whole thing
[1:26:15] and then yielding yourself to the will
[1:26:17] of god and that's why placing
[1:26:19] placing by the word is so important
[1:26:22] because the word is actually putting us
[1:26:23] where we're supposed to be in the word
[1:26:26] and when you're placed
[1:26:28] brother ram said when the child was born
[1:26:30] he was a son but his conduct
[1:26:32] had to do with his inheritance now i
[1:26:34] want you to be real honest now he said
[1:26:36] don't you think that we've tried to push
[1:26:37] the inheritance
[1:26:38] just a little bit further farther than
[1:26:40] god our conduct went
[1:26:42] that's what's the matter today we should
[1:26:44] be way on up the road yonder but we're
[1:26:46] way
[1:26:47] back down here
[1:26:51] my goodness i got so many notes i don't
[1:26:53] even
[1:26:55] and our conduct what is our
[1:26:58] our conduct is the holy ghost conduct
[1:27:01] that's what god wants to do
[1:27:03] is look upon our life and see see holy
[1:27:06] ghost conduct
[1:27:07] do you realize that's what the statue of
[1:27:09] a perfect man the statue of a perfect
[1:27:10] man is not
[1:27:11] learning about something and just being
[1:27:13] like well that's a good idea
[1:27:15] the statue of a perfect man is actually
[1:27:16] the holy ghost working
[1:27:18] in you the life of god that's why virtue
[1:27:21] virtue is not just virtuous living but
[1:27:23] it's
[1:27:23] power and strength the power and
[1:27:26] strength of the holy ghost
[1:27:27] actually working in the hearts and lives
[1:27:29] of the believer
[1:27:30] it's actually where that gives you power
[1:27:32] to lay hands on the sick and they will
[1:27:34] recover it gives you power
[1:27:35] to speak the word and life will be given
[1:27:38] into somebody else that they can be born
[1:27:39] again
[1:27:40] by the words that you speak that
[1:27:41] somebody else can actually draw from
[1:27:43] your strength
[1:27:44] because it's not your strength it's holy
[1:27:46] ghost strength
[1:27:47] it's it's holy ghost knowledge it's not
[1:27:50] your knowledge by your intellectual
[1:27:51] understanding
[1:27:52] but it's holy ghost knowledge where god
[1:27:54] is revealing to you the correct
[1:27:56] interpretation of the word
[1:27:57] it's holy those patients where when you
[1:27:59] look at somebody with real holy ghost
[1:28:01] patients you're looking and saying
[1:28:03] i know that that's not a man living
[1:28:05] under some natural influence that's got
[1:28:07] to be
[1:28:07] that's got to be a work of god that's
[1:28:10] the kind of
[1:28:11] public display that god wants to see and
[1:28:13] an adopted son of god where
[1:28:15] you look at somebody i know that that's
[1:28:17] not that man doing that of his own will
[1:28:19] that's holy ghost temperance holy ghost
[1:28:22] control
[1:28:23] holy ghost control over that man's life
[1:28:25] that when something somebody smites him
[1:28:27] upside the face
[1:28:28] that he's in control that the holy ghost
[1:28:31] in that man is in control and he does
[1:28:32] just smite back
[1:28:34] and his holy ghost god in us to know
[1:28:36] what god wants done with the word
[1:28:38] and to match up with what the word says
[1:28:40] that's what godliness
[1:28:41] is godliness is to do what god wants
[1:28:44] done
[1:28:45] to know what he wants done to act like

[1:30:03] i sound critical on things well i'm
[1:30:04] talking in private
[1:30:05] but the message is not just about being
[1:30:07] born again
[1:30:08] and it is not just about closed hair and
[1:30:11] dress
[1:30:12] the message is about god actually
[1:30:15] molding you
[1:30:15] putting his life into you and building
[1:30:18] you into the style a
[1:30:19] living idol a living a living tabernacle
[1:30:22] what god himself is living inside of you

[1:30:33] in the if they have been placed by my
[1:30:35] word
[1:30:35] when i preached a word to them they
[1:30:37] didn't shout they weren't offended
[1:30:39] they might have been offended at first
[1:30:41] but they yielded themselves
[1:30:42] over time the the stone makes them
[1:30:44] chipping away
[1:30:45] until finally that i could put them
[1:30:48] exactly in the pyramid
[1:30:50] right where they're supposed to be
[1:30:51] placed they allow themselves to be
[1:30:53] placed by the word
[1:30:55] they allow themselves to be emboldened
[1:30:57] that's what the message is
[1:30:59] the message is to bring a bride to
[1:31:01] adoption
[1:31:02] that god can use for his purpose
[1:31:05] a message to tell you not to settle
[1:31:08] let's stand to our feet
[1:31:09] the mission musician can come forward
[1:31:11] the message
[1:31:12] the message is don't settle for what
[1:31:15] you've got
[1:31:16] but keep moving on keep moving on
[1:31:19] because there's more where that came
[1:31:28] from

[1:31:36] gave all for us that
[1:31:38] died and sacrificed everything and rose
[1:31:41] from the grave on this easter morning
[1:31:43] so that we could have a part in this
[1:31:45] right
[1:31:46] so that you could reach out to the lost
[1:31:48] and reach out to your lost family and
