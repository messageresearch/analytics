MATTHEW 19:16-24
»     16     †      ¶  And, behold, one came and said unto him, Good Master, what good thing shall I do, that I may have eternal life? 
»     17     †     And he said unto him, Why callest thou me good? there is none good but one, that is, God: but if thou wilt enter into life, keep the commandments.
»     18     †     He saith unto him, Which? Jesus said, Thou shalt do no murder, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness, 
»     19     †     Honour thy father and thy mother: and, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.
»     20     †     The young man saith unto him, All these things have I kept from my youth up: what lack I yet? 
»     21     †     Jesus said unto him, If thou wilt be perfect, go and sell that thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come and follow me.
»     22     †     But when the young man heard that saying, he went away sorrowful: for he had great possessions. 
»     23     †      ¶  Then said Jesus unto his disciples, Verily I say unto you, That a rich man shall hardly enter into the kingdom of heaven.
»     24     †     And again I say unto you, It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God. 

HEBREWS 11:23-26
»     23     †     By faith Moses, when he was born, was hid three months of his parents, because they saw he was a proper child; and they were not afraid of the king's commandment. 
»     24     †     By faith Moses, when he was come to years, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter; 
»     25     †     Choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of God, than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season; 
»     26     †     Esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures in Egypt: for he had respect unto the recompence of the reward.

has blessed many people all over the world for a number of years and uh so it's really good to be here we thank God for uh brother Samuel Dell amen and just all his labor over the years he just saw how the Lord has used him and uh brother Wade we met a few years ago and and um you know at some camps there with brother Burley Williams and brother Wade and his wife and I believe some of the Saints it would come and just kind of serve in those camps and you know just always behind the scenes really not not doing anything up front but uh taking care of the food and all of that and that's very important job and we uh you know just we just appreciate it you know how they served and and just uh just what a blessing they were because we took a lot of young people to those meetings and many lives were really really transformed by you know what happened there so we just appreciate that so when I when I heard that brother Wade um wanted me to come by um you know there there are certain places and I'm gonna be honest there's certain places you go and you get invited and you have to the first first thing I mean you don't even think about it I got to pray about that I really got to pray about that there's other places that you get invited to they say how can I get there yeah because you know that the seed has already been sown and this is a church that uh you all sowed seeds for years you know so it's like how can I get there and do what I can for the cause of Christ so we're happy to be here amen my wife sister Erica is with me and uh also my daughter Sister Sarah uh my youngest daughter uh we we thank God for them being with us so we bring you greetings from West Palm Beach Florida sunny sunny South uh South Florida yeah very warm 90 90 degrees warm uh we bring you greetings from Spirit and Truth Tabernacle amen there in West Palm Beach Florida all right I won't um take too much of your time have you standing let's turn our Bibles really quickly to uh two passages of scripture uh one is Matthew 19. and uh being that we are directing service to the youth I will do all I can to make sure that we put cookies on the lower shelf so that the children can get to them amen praise the Lord amen and I and I will not try to choke the church in any way because I tell you what I've seen people do that and then they end up on the deep end somewhere so we just want to bring the gospel Lord Jesus uh Matthew Matthew 19 and uh verse 16 um it says this and behold one came and said unto him good master uh what good thing shall I do that I may have eternal life and he said unto him why call us thou me good there is none good but one that is God but if thou will enter into life keep the Commandments saith unto him which Jesus said um uh Thou shalt do no murder Thou shalt uh not commit adultery Thou shalt not steal Thou shalt not bear false witness honor thy father and thy mother and thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself the young man saith unto him all these things have I kept from my youth up what lack I yet uh Jesus said unto him if thou Wilt be perfect go and sell that thou Hast and give to the poor and thou shalt have treasure in heaven and come and follow me but when the young man heard that saying he went away sorrowful for he had great possessions then said Jesus unto unto his disciples verily I say unto you that a rich man shall hardly enter into the Kingdom of Heaven again I say unto you it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God and real quickly over in Deuteronomy chapter 30 we'll catch a a verse there as well amen Deuteronomy 30. I won't I gave the brothers a number of verses there but I only want to read one verse 19. in Deuteronomy 30. it says uh I call Heaven and Earth to record this day against you that I have set before your life and death blessing and cursing therefore choose life that both thou and thy seed may live amen the lord of the blessing to the reading of his word let's just Bound in a brief word of prayer amen father we thank you for the privilege and the opportunity we have to read the word of God but we know it takes the Holy Spirit to come and Quicken Lord what we've read that it would apply to us even right now so we ask that you administer to every heart those that are present those that are online we know that you have complete control over each and every person God so we ask that you would get all the glory all the honor and all the praise in Jesus name we pray amen amen God bless you you can be seated amen again so since we are talking primarily to the youth we have prepared in that fashion and we want to just use for a title uh today make the right choice make the right choice we want to just kind of start here by reading a few things from the prophet those that the brothers that have this in the back I'm actually starting at the second paragraph uh here and in this message thirsting for Life brother random uh makes a statement it says and if we have been brought to this place by the grace of God and we're free moral agents to make a choice and if the holy spirit that brought us from the uh from the earth and starts to brooding to our hearts and we accept him and brute back to him how much more is he able to raise us up in the last days when we got a chance to make a choice all right he says so it could only be through the brooding of the Holy Spirit that's how life comes is by the Holy Spirit therefore you can only have life by the Holy Spirit uh that's why Jesus said accept the man be born again he can in no wise see the kingdom of God and it goes on he says this uh and the psalmist saying thy love and kindness is better than life then I began to think what kind of life was he speaking of that the loving kindness of Father the love kindness of father was better than life then it come to my mind there is a way that seemeth like its life and and I love that statement here you know because um I'll go forward in this quote in a little bit but when we think about life as especially when it comes to young people uh the enemy or Satan loves to try to get to think that we're missing out on life when we're serving God right he tries to get us to think that you know there's so much more outside of serving God there you know and unfortunately there is a lot more out there but it's it's only produced in death amen I mean I was I was reading something a little earlier today just a little devotion and and brother Graham saying you're gonna hey it's a young man would get his check and he he wants to take this young girl out but when he goes out to take the take her to eat he has to pay if they want to go to a club he has to pay if they want to go here he has to pay it's going to cost you something to go out there and try to enjoy life but when you come to Christ you come without a price right it's without money and without it's without price and it's something that gives you eternal life hallelujah amen uh you you can never go wrong by serving God never ever go wrong and I love the way even what we read in scripture the things that you choose today will actually affect you and your seed right it's not just you but even as young people as you decide right now you're not even married some are not even married but if you decide right now I'm going to serve God that will affect your family in the future hallelujah amen it pays to serve God here he goes on in this quote and he says uh then I begin to think what kind of life was he speaking of that the love kindness of father was better than life then it came to my mind that there is a way that seemeth like its life it's a perverted life all right he says now the devil cannot create nothing God is the only Creator there is and what is unrighteousness it's righteousness perverted then we notice that there's a perversion of righteousness makes unrighteousness it's not original it's not right the original it is right it says therefore God had no beginning and he has no ending and if we become part of God we can no more die then God can die because we got his life in Us by the new birth and we're just as Eternal as God is eternal we cannot perish Jesus said he that heareth my words believe on him that sent me and hath eternal life shall never come into the Judgment but his past from Death to life now before I go forth further a man in in my quotes uh we're talking about making the right choice brother Branham you know make some some statements here you can just take that down for me because these are my my personal notes and I'll just give them only the quotes but where you see the little um uh bullets those are my personal notes but uh if um when we talk about Choice brother random made some comments about Choice he said choice is actually a great thing yeah yeah right so so yeah and no matter what age we are we all have to make choices right no matter what age we are we all we all are making choices you know and and I can I can I can tell you right now uh some of those choices uh that you make you know you get a chance to choose your friends young people you get a chance to choose your friends you you get a chance to choose who you're going to hang with you get a chance to you know and at a certain point in life maybe not right now but you get a chance to choose your church right you get a chance to choose what Pastor you're gonna sit under right what Pastor you raise your your kids under you get a chance to do that right you get a chance to choose your spouse when you're thinking about getting married it is your choice no one makes you marry that person it is your choice and when you make the choice you have to live with the choice right uh you get a chance to um uh for some of those that's probably not at the age of thing about marriage you get a chance to choose whether to lie or not lie amen everybody makes a choice when something happens in the house and you know and and I don't know about your parents but I've always had this this extra person living in my house and I I don't know uh how he how they got there whether it's a he I don't know he she I don't know what it is but I'd ask my kids who did this I don't know became a person that lived in my house and I could never find this person who is I don't know he he has to live here somewhere right I could never talk to I don't know right so so so so a child has the has the uh the opportunity to choose the line or not lie and there are results from lying and not lying you can you can choose to say yes or no to trouble you can choose to get involved and not get involved you you you get a chance to choose right you can choose to serve God or you can choose not to serve him right you can choose to follow God's word or you can choose not to right we all have a choice some of the things that you cannot choose that you can't choose the family you were born in you can't change that you can't choose the family that God God orchestrated God for ordained the family that you'll be born in you can't choose your your height you can't you can't you can't choose that God choose that your God you can't choose your eye well I shouldn't say that because nowadays people go and change their eye colors but but but your natural high color you can't you God is the one to ordained that Hallelujah right amen there there's a lot of things you can't you can't choose your genetic makeup God is the one that that we can put it that way God did that himself and the reason he did that is because you're fearful and wonderfully made he had a special design just for you and there's no one can take your place blessed be the name of the Lord but so there are things that we can choose and things that we can't choose choice is a great thing the prophet says he says there's an unwritten law Among Us of choosing and it says you have the right to choose you have the right to choose and you also have the right you also have uh you have the you have to live with the results of whatever choice or whatever decision you make here uh in the message leadership brother random says this he says the first is a mother's kindness then the father's word and after the mother gives you your first step then you look to your daddy all of us for wisdom because he is the head of the house and usually not not that he's any smarter but it's just made a leader of his family so we follow what our daddy says do when he says now son I would like for you to do a certain certain thing then we listen to him uh because it's wisdom but listen see he has learned a whole lot and we've got to ask him to see what he learned and then we can prop it by by um by what he has learned he tells us now don't go and do this because I did that my father told me not to do it but I did it and caused this to happen to me something bad so see then he daddy tells us how to do and what to do right goes on it says then after Mother leads us till the time we have to get a little wisdom to understand from Daddy and then we get another we get another leader and that's the teacher a good school teacher she tries to teach you and give you an education to to to fit you better in life place a position you can read uh your Bible and you can read the songs and you can learn of God and read yourself if you see and uh you know brother Branham you know had one of these teachers uh like that was kind of teaching him and he gave the he always talked about he had a really bad temper problem and this teacher what she would tell them to say now before you go out there and get in the fight I want you to take a string and I want you to tie so many knots in that string and uh and then by the time you get all those knots tied hopefully your temper calm down you won't even have to you won't need to fight well brother Brandon we're going to start tying that string and say he before he can get maybe one knot in it's just so out of control that he took off he's fighting anyway he just could not get that temper under control hallelujah amen but we realized what got the temper and the controllers when he come in contact with the Holy Ghost that's where God is Temple under control Hallelujah if we find I find ourselves in the place we have a temper problem we need to come in contact with the Holy Ghost he'll take care of that temporary issue Hallelujah glory to God so the prophet goes on to say this he says um you can you can read your Bible and you can read the songs and you can learn of God and read yourself you see and then another thing maybe you'd have business and somebody write your letter mama daddy somebody write your letter you couldn't read it see so the teacher she she had you then and she leads you to learn to write and to read and it's a good thing a good teacher to teach it right but now after you leave that you after you leave the teacher one teacher after the other one from a little primer a little first grade until you get out of high school or go to college then when you leave college and then the teacher is through leading you see he says now mama has taught you to walk see Papa has taught you how to be brilliant and a nice young man and how to take care of yourself and behave yourself the teacher has taught you an education how to read and write but now you're leaving you are leaving mama and you are leaving the teacher now somebody has to take you from here on now who do you want to take you from here on who do you want to take you from here on right we might have some young people that might be facing uh graduation at high school who do you want to take you from here on maybe even graduate from college who do you want to take you from here on right and and and here you know brother Brandon while he's sitting there and and giving his sermon of leadership there in Arizona one of the little kids just yes it says Jesus and brother Brandon said that's right that's right Jesus to take you from their own he said now that's a very good answer very fine jesus takes you from their own and that's exactly what we want you know you have to make the choice whether you're going to allow Jesus to take you from here on or you're going to allow yourself to lead you you have to make a choice amen you have to make a choice amen all right let's see here um let me uh just read this other one here as we just kind of go into something because you know we want to we want to just kind of show different ones in the Bible that make choices and how their choices worked out and other ones that didn't work out because they made the wrong choice we want to encourage you make make the right choice here in this sermon uh the conflict between God and Satan brother random says this Satan and Eden when he first come to those attack to attack a person knowing the children of God was fortified with his word Satan attacked the word amen I want you to think about that he didn't he you know he he attacked what they believed the word what they were standing on he attacked what they were believing amen and really that's that's how Satan he he does the same thing even right now some of the young people that struggled Satan begins to just get you to question your faith he attacks what you believe he's not attacking you directly he attacks what you believe and before you ignore it you allow those thoughts just to fester and and you you find you question this and you question that and you question all these things and next thing you know you're so far out you know don't know how you got there he he attacked the word look at this the prophet says knowing the children of God was fortified with his word Satan attacked the word he never attacked the being he attacked the word first look at that sneaker lizard what he does today the first thing he can't lay it on uh the first first uh first thing he can't lay it on say well that's not a good person that's a good person see but the only thing he tries to do no matter how good the person is is to get them to deny that word that's just the only thing he wants to do get you to deny that word so Satan tried to attack the word in the Garden of Eden so he had TR he had to say he uh so he had to say he had to have something now that he could use to the human being would look better than the word see had to have something that would look better to the human being than the word and and do you know what he used something that looked better than the word to the human being what Satan used was reasoning to have a reasoning just what he said common sense so that's what he used and he succeeded so that's what is used all alone brother Branham goes on says but God can't give us nothing else but his word because that's what he chose first and when God makes a decision even God made a choice God made a choice when God had to choose something to give his people to defeat Satan with and let me tell you something God God when God made a choice this was not something that would only defeat Satan 4 000 years ago or or 5 000 years ago when God makes a choice it's an eternal decision and God made a decision that he gives people something that would defeat Satan no matter what day and time that they were living in the Earth Hallelujah no matter what generation they were living in they would still be able to defeat Satan with the same weapon that everybody before them defeated him with Hallelujah and that weapon is the word of God we use the word of God to defeat the enemy with amen look at what he says here it says Satan said when God make God makes a decision God has to ever remain that way Satan took reasonings and took reasoning and attacked the word and shook Eve off the path that's right by reason it's human reasoning now the only way that um that she could have got uh the only way he should uh he she could have got to uh disbelieve God's word it had to be appealing and Satan knows how to make reasoning appealing it has to appeal to you and sin is very appealing he says and there's only one sin and that's unbelief so if it's really appealing Satan makes sin so appealing to you amen Satan used reasoning to attack the word but God gave you the word in order to overcome the enemy as we can see at the very beginning with Adam and Eve they had to make a choice amen amen and uh no matter who we are what what what what what what what what uh generation we live in we all come to a place of choice right Adam and Eve had to choose whether to eat of the Tree of Life or the tree of knowledge good and evil and we know according to scripture they they made the wrong choice amen they ate from the Tree of knowledge good and evil and it's created all the problems that we have in the world today we we understand that the attributes of God have still been expressed through it God has a way of making a man things work out to his perfect will no matter what it is but but nonetheless what what life have been like had they not made that choice Adam and Eve had to make a choice we can look back Amen in the days of Abraham Abraham had to choose to leave the land of herb and dwell in the plains of memory amen he had that he had to make that choice and once he made the choice he's God showed him how much he would be blessed by making that choice hallelujah amen and even when Abraham made the choice he also made another choice to bring lot along with him Hallelujah and when we look in the scripture they had to come to a spot where they had to make a choice of separating from one another and when they when when Abraham gave lot the opportunity to choose lot chose the best of the Lamb Abraham stayed in the place but lot did happen did not realize where he made the choice to live in Sodom and Gomorrah he did not realize one day that City would be destroyed by almighty God he made the wrong choice while he was down there inside him God came to him and visited with the two angels and gave him another opportunity make a choice to leave Sodom throughout life we'll go from situation to situation where we have to make choices my encouragement to you amen this afternoon make the right choice there's results from our choosing whether it's good or bad there's always results from our choosing make the right choice even in the days of Joshua Joshua brought the the people a man of Israel over into the promised land and and as they were conquering you know in the land and and claiming the land Joshua got them to the end and he began to remind them of all the things that God did and he set amen the word of God in front of the people says choose ye this day Susie this day whom you will serve right they had to make a choice the children of Israel had to make a choice even today we have to make a choice Elijah challenged the children of Israel to not remain haunted between two two opinions but to choose whether to serve God or to serve Baal we find ourselves generation after generation having to make a choice Ruth chose one day that she was going to go with Naomi she says your God will be my God your people will be my people where you die I will die Ruth made the right choice and we would follow her life she ended up marrying Boaz and and end up even being part of the lineage of the Lord Jesus Christ it because she made the right choice her sister-in-law had an opportunity to choose Oprah went back but Ruth went forth by faith and look at what her results were make the right choice I want to look at this Rich Young Ruler again because he he made a choice we read there a man in in Matthew about this young man and how he approached the Lord Jesus but you know I thank God for a prophet because this same story in Matthew is also told in the Book of Luke and um and you know when we when we go back and we look at the Book of Luke we we see things just say a rich man a rich man a rich man a rich man but a prophet was able to kind of tie this together and it tells us that this was the same rich man now here's the other thing about it is that when you when you look at Jesus telling the various Parables because um uh in Luke 12 in Luke 12 we see that this rich man uh he got he got rich and he had so many bar I mean he had so much stuff that uh he makes some choices in life where you know what he he got rich he got she got wealthy you know all for these choices that he made but uh but the problem is is that he didn't consider his soul he didn't consider his soul you know and oftentimes young people you have to be careful that sometimes we might make a choice in a career and that career could be very damaging Amen to our spiritual walk sometimes we have to choose to say no to a job and God will put it before you he'll set it for you to see which way you will choose sometimes we have to put God first and I love it because the Bible actually says seek ye first the kingdom of heaven and all of its righteousness and everything else will be added unto you I've had to say no to job sometimes that I knew would take me out of Fellowship but you know what I saw God blessed me more when I said no to that than what I would have had if I would have said yes to it no matter how much money they're offering you have to choose Christ he has to be first he owns it all anyway amen and there's a lot more where that come from if you just choose God here you know and and oftentimes we have that prayer uh Lord if it's not your will then God just somehow no no no no no he doesn't move like that all the time he wants to see what you're going to choose and my encouragement is make the right choice sometimes if you want mama daddy to give you the pastor to tell you no they want to see what you're going to choose make the right choice you know this this this Rich Young Ruler we found him in Luke 12 and and you know he got he got to a spot where he was he was just doing very very well for himself he said you know I got so much that I don't my barns can't contain it and he decided that he would have built greater Barnes you know than the ones that he had and and uh but the the sad part about you know where he found himself is that he had not made preparation for his eternal I shouldn't say Turner but his his resting place after after death because you can't go to hell and live eternally there's only one form of eternal life and that's what you receive through Christ amen if you reject Christ you cannot have eternal life just doesn't work that way right so so he he rejected a man cry and when we when we saw a story there in Luke 12 um you know what what it is what I always felt is that Jesus was just really just giving prophecy about this young man he was just telling talking about him before they actually met him later on in Luke right but he's just telling stories about this this young man and here he got he got greater after he rejected Christ this young man got greater riches he was already a Rich Young Ruler but he got greater riches after he made the choice to reject Christ but also it tells us in Luke 16 that this same young man lifted up his eyes in hell he made the wrong choice and he might have got greater riches he might have did this he might in my his name might have made it into to to uh some great book or something like that but you know ultimately he he ended up losing his soul and the Bible says what does it profit a man to gain this world and then lose his soul this young man made the wrong choice Luke 18 we see um another little apparel about this young man and and we can pull it up Luke 18 verse 18 through 23 and this is the same story that we read of him that we read of him and and and and and Matthew says in a certain ruler acts I'm saying good Master what shall I do to inherit eternal life when Jesus said unto him and like I said it was it was prophecy when you look in Luke 12 and Luke 16 Jesus just really talking prophecy of this young man before he actually comes to him and meets him personally Jesus already told you now he's going to reject me and what is going to be his end result not only saw what his end result was going to be on Earth but his end result and what is going to happen after he left the Earth look at this in a certain rule asked him saying good Master what shall I do to inherit eternal life and Jesus said to him why color stop me good none is good safe one that is God thou knowest the Commandments do not commit adultery do not kill do not still do not bear false witness honor thy father not mother and he said all these I have kept from my youth up and I'm gonna tell you I really like that statement I've actually preached a sermon on that uh keep it from your youth up I want I mean it's I think it's good that this young man had a testimony actually the scripture tells us that Jesus loved him Jesus absolutely loved him he appreciated this young man and I Think Jesus would love anybody can say I've kept the word from my youth up I I I I'm in my 50s now but I've kept the word since a young man and I'm still keeping it today I think it's a wonderful Testament if you got young people that can raise up Amen in in the house of God say I've been keeping the word since my youth up what a testimony to whole he goes on to say this in verse 22 and now when Jesus heard these things he said in them yet lacketh thou one thing sell all that thou has distributed to the poor thou shall have treasure into heaven and come follow me when he heard this he was very sorrowful for he was very rich and when Jesus saw that he was very sorrowful he said how hardly so they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God for it is easier for a camera to go through a needle's eye than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God Amen this young man had a choice that he made that day his choice was to walk away from Christ he walked away from Christ and and like I said you go back and pick up a store in Luke 16 you'll find that in hell he lifted up his eyes he made the wrong choice brother random makes a statement here in the message Investments he says but this Rich Young Man now here's something for you businessman and I have to close notice now so you'll get this let this sink deep in your hearts by rejecting Jesus that never stopped his increase of goods right he continued on let's follow him a while down through the Bible his flow of goods got greater and because your business picks up a little bit don't you never think that all the time that's God's blessings the wicked prosper you know this man he got greater and he got to a place till he he was so great to all of his barns bursted almost he had to build new ones now he thought he had done the right thing by turning down Jesus and not making an investment in him he thought he he had done the right thing because in the worldly possessions if I'm gonna say something now he says I'm going to say something now in worldly possessions he thought he'd done the right thing because he had prospered and that's what our denominations think because they organize themselves and their groups become multi-millionaires Millionaires and billionaires they feel that they are it it says didn't the Bible say thou rich and increased in Goods to this age but don't know that you're naked miserable poor wretched blind and don't even know it what a miserable condition men and Brethren don't make an investment in something like that it's bound to perish why not make an investment in something that's proved that's proved down through the Bible as you know with the text I got written here we could be here tonight still on these texts proving Through the Bible those who made that and who turned it down I am showing you a real investment to make put your life your time your money your talent put everything you got in Christ God guaranteed it uh guaranteed it to us by raising them up again we'll rise in the last days he promised it what more could you look forward to tell me any investment you can make with payoff like that tell me where you can invest this morning and make 10 million dollars in tomorrow be a corpse what good would it do you what profit a man if he gain the whole world and loses Soul what if you're popular and cause so-and-so and Deacon Presbyterian Dr Bishop Elder Pope or whatever you might be called that's the Praises of men I'd rather be called a Holy Roller by the people and have been a Son of God in my heart with the new birth and the spirit of Christ dwelling in me and him proving it by the Vindication of his word and making me live the life that I once lived I don't live no more Paul said and yet he was a teacher and a scholar but he changed his life when he met Christ and made him and made and made his investment in Christ he was a different man from then on even Paul had to choose to follow Christ even Paul had to choose I mean brother Branham had to come to a spot one day where he chose to follow Christ amen your pastor amen any Minister that's standing up before the people they all had to come to a choice one day to follow Christ young people you're in the same spot you have to follow you have to choose to follow Christ Jesus is a gentleman he won't force himself on one of us but he wants us to open our hearts and receive him the Rich Young Ruler failed to make the right choice but we have another character in the scripture that we want to compare and that's with Moses because Moses chose the suffer the afflictions with the people of God he had it I mean he had it made Moses was you know you all know the story of Moses mother and his and he I mean think about the choice that his mother and the father had to make one day when they were there in the house and and and and and and and and and and all a pharaoh and all of his uh Army was going looking for all the babies to try to kill everybody two years old and under they had this they had this this law passed and they wanted them to kill all the little boy babies and and his mother and father made a choice that they were going to put Moses in a little basket and push him out into the Nile River never I mean and the choice was so um the choice was so that they they probably thought they'd never see their son again they'd never they would never know what happened to their son they're gonna just commit them to the Nile River oh Hallelujah the good thing about this story is that Miriam watched the baby just go down the Nile River and and and the baby ended up making it to Pharaoh's Court Pharaoh's daughter out there you know bathing in in in the river and and she sees this basket come up and she can't have children herself so she she takes to say I'm gonna make this baby my own right and when Miriam sees the sees the sees that she's she pipes up said would you like for me to get somebody to help raise the baby for you and and she's like yeah go find somebody real quick Miriam had the perfect person in mind so I'm gonna run back home and tell Mama they need a babysitter in Pharaoh's Court well who am I gonna babysit it's going to be your own baby mama can you believe this Moses mother made the choice to give up a baby to them now and now I've got rewards sir by letting her raise her own baby in Pharaoh's court and she got paid for it she made the right choice when Moses was there being raised and his mother is remember brother random said Mother's the first teacher and while he's being raised but the babysitter has an opportunity to sow some seeds in him to tell him you know this is what happened and that's what happened and God has called you to be the deliverer I mean you're the one you're a special child your proper child God has called you to be delivered Moses don't you get caught up in the things of Egypt I don't care what they offer you are a Hebrew and don't ever forget that and Moses had had the world in his hands but the Bible tells us that he he made a different choice let's pick it up in Hebrews chapter 11. verse 23-26 let's read what the Bible says about Moses how he made he made the right choice yeah Hebrews 11 verse 23 says by faith Moses when he was born was hit three months of his parents because they saw that he was a proper child and they were not afraid of the king's commandment by faith Moses see he had he had to come to this on his own by faith Moses when he was come to years not just because mama said it not because daddy said it no but but I came to this decision on my own when he when he was come to years refused [Music] to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter choosing rather to suffer Affliction with the people of God he looked out the window and saw all the suffering he says but I belong to them I belong to be out there with them he chose choosing rather to rather than be in the palace I choose to suffer Affliction with the people of God than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures in Egypt for he had respect them to the recompense of the war Moses did not realize that his choosing was going to be so great look at how God used him to open up a Red Sea to get them really close to going into the promised land he he had spies go over and spied all out I mean just just all the supernatural things that happened down in Egypt before they left I mean so many great things God used this man Moses but Moses Moses had to make a choice I encourage you make the right choice I don't I don't I don't know what God has for your future but I know if you make the right choice great things are in store [Applause] there's a couple quotes that I want to read about Moses here and this was coming out of the message looking at the Unseen brother random says Moses when he had become 40 years old a young man and as far as sight was concerned Moses had the world in his hand he was the next pharaoh of Egypt and he had all the lands in the world riding right in his hand to be king over the entire Earth knowing of that day and yet he looked through the window that Pharaoh looked out of and he saw those Hebrews to pharaoh who looked upon them they were nothing but a bunch of mutt daubers down there in the mud making brick to the celebrity as past to the celebrity has passed by they were the same the well-dressed people that was a bunch of slaves nothing but mud wallers but when Moses looked out the same window he saw them different because he looked at the Unseen and know that God promised that he would deliver them out of the place out of that place and take them to the land of promise for he looked at the Unseen he saw the year that he saw the years that were coming ahead he saw Egypt destroyed yet uh yet she uh yet she was in her a blossoming time he saw Egypt as she is today and he saw Israel all comfortably seated around Abraham in glory and by faith he chose to take the worst of the real the worst the religion could give him and compared with the best the world could give him and he chose the suffer the approach of Christ and considered a great treasure then all Egypt could afford to give him because he endured as seeing him who is invisible I want to let's keep on reading it says here was Moses he had his one foot on the throne this is out of the message to Resurrection I believe uh I'm sorry the results of the decision uh he here was Moses he had his foot on the throne he could have had a great he could have turned uh turned on Egypt down there and maybe stayed there but God's promise was a journey through the Wilderness and go to the promised land go to get uh got to get in position first and Moses chose rather to suffer with the people than to set on the throne down there because it was revealed to him spiritually and here he was going and God was proving here's how you know whether you're in the right group or not God always vindicates his church with signs and wonders no matter how Orthodox you are it depends on whether God is accepting his sacrifice right and here's another that I just love out of this sermon by faith Moses brother random talks about Moses making that choice and and we all have to come to the spot where we make the right choice no matter who we are no matter what generation we live in we all have a uh we have to we have to choose from the days of Adam and Eve to our day we have to choose he said there's a chosen we choose for ourselves we choose something that's for our own good but Moses chose the afflictions and the disgrace that he might walk with the people of God think of it now listen to it choose the afflictions of the people of God and counter a greater treasure a greater treasure that's something I mean just in your mindset I think being in a church is greater than me being out there in the world and becoming a millionaire serving God that that's better that's a greater treasure it goes against common thinking but yet it's God's way look at this it says this that he might walk with the people of God think of it listen to it choose the Affliction of the people of God encounter the greater treasure for he endured seeing him who was invisibly now a lot one time had to make a choice and maybe this morning that there'll be men and women sitting here that'll make your final choice the prophet says you are today what you are because several years ago you chose to be what you are now he says what you choose now today what you choose now will determine what you'll be five years from today he says five years for today you may be a missionary five years from today you may be a renowned Christian or five years from today you may be in hell like the Rich Young Ruler was because you made the wrong decision it says five years from today you may be cleaning spit Tunes in a ballroom ashtrays right five years from today you may be a prostitute on the street or you may be a man or a woman that's a credit to any society because of your choice for Christ he says five years from day you may be in glory going in the Rapture because you made your choice today but you've got to choose and don't look at what you see choose what you see by faith that's the only thing that would count is what you choose by faith brother Branham had to make a choice one day and I'm going towards the end of this sermon I'm bringing it to a close um brother Branham had to make a choice one day he was there amongst the the Baptists he was an ordained minister there in the Baptist Church and they had a great pastor but you know he come to a spot where he knew God was calling him for more and they um they asked him to to or help ordain women preachers and brother random you know said no I'm sorry I can't do that that's against the word of God and and I can't go against the word of God you know I got to stay with the word no matter what what the church says I'm going to say what the word says and he uh and so his Pastor said you know what if you're not going to ordain women preachers then you know we're going to take your cart back and you're not going to be able to be a minister he said well that's fine you can take my card well he decided to leave the church and I told the pastor that God showed him in a vision that he prayed for kings and important people he would do all kind of things like are you a young man seventh grade education how are you going to do that he says I don't know how I'm going to do it but I know God told me that I would do it he says yo you have some really really bad dreams that's all you had you ate the wrong thing you have some bad news like well you can say whatever you want to say but I'm going to make my choice I'm going to stay with the word of God God gave him other pulpits to preaching and because of his choice his ministry has impacted the whole world around this message is going forth praise the Lord we thank God for him making a choice but one day brother Branham was at a meeting and and uh when he when he went to the meeting he preached the sermon and at the end of the sermon uh a brother walked up to him and just began to make comments you know about the sermon and uh and and before he knew it as the man was making the comments the man burst out and speaking in tongues and as he spoke in tongues he had never spoken tongues one day of his life but this young man burst down in tongues and and three people walked up and said you know what uh that that was perfect French that was not that we don't need an interpreter for that that was perfect Prince and and the three people that walked up one guy happened to be you know um I mean real real high up and I want to read what he said there but real high up in the government he's like I know I'm a French interpreter and I know that was just perfect French had three as a witness and this is what uh they said in the message standing in the gap it says listen to this I can if I can read it it says I Victor Ledoux am a full-blooded Frenchman born again Christian filled with the Holy Holy Spirit my address is 809 North King Road Los Angeles 46 I attend the Bethel Temple Pastor Arnie Vic Pastor a true translation that I proclaim a prophecy set over brother Branham given by Danny Henry and French February 11 1961 at the Full Gospel businessman's breakfast a true translation of the prophecy now here is what it said then this man walked up Danny Henry walked up and spoke in Toms and and this was the the interpretation of says because thou has chosen The Narrow Path the Hardaway thou has walked in your own choosing you chose to do it the harder way you chose that and and look at this it says now I can I can see that Moses had to make his choice too see says thou has picked the precise and correct way he made the right choice thou has picked the precise and correct way correct decision and it is my way and I should have underlined it because it said underlined my way the holy spirit's speaking back right it says because of this momentous decision a huge portion of Heaven awaits you awaits thee what a glorious decision says now listen close it what a glorious decision thou has made this in itself is that which will make and come to pass the tremendous victory in the love divine amen my encouragement to every young person amen make the right choice choose to follow God choose to serve him with everything you got this world has nothing to offer nothing of Eternal value Deuteronomy 30 in 19 I call Heaven and Earth to record this day against you but I have set before your life and death blessing and cursing therefore choose life that both thou and thy seed may live yeah let's pray father God we thank you for your word your word has the ability to penetrate Lord right where we are you know how to reach us you know how to speak to us God and I know Lord that you would have this sermon ministered here today because maybe somebody's at a point where they need to make a choice the encouragement from the Holy Spirit today is to make the right choice amen the examples have been sent a rich young ruler who who did not make the right choice Lord in the scripture clearly told us that he lifted his eyes and hail this Barnes got greater he was more wealthy and that's not a sign that it's God's blessing sometimes it's Satan that's behind all of that drawing us further and further away from from Christ I pray that you'd help us to discern it and to always keep the word first no matter what decisions we're making let us base our decisions on the word of God then we know that we're standing on the proper Foundation we also saw father Moses he made the right choice and God uh you you he had to come to a spot where you know I I I no longer want to be called the daughter of pharaoh and that's not my that's not who I am I am I'm a child of Israel and I I have to get out there and be with be with them I'm raised I was born to be to deliver and father he made the right choice to suffer the afflictions with the people of God rather than enjoy the the pleasures of sin so Lord uh how you raise them up and how you use them as a minor delivery even Moses was able to make the statement the Lord your God will raise a prophet like unto me what a what a statement knowing that Christ was coming Lord we thank you that he made the right choice that we can we can gain from these examples and even your Prophet Lord one day having to leave the Baptist Church and stay stand with the word of God my I think even is is his first mother-in-law uh called the the Holy Rollers the outcasts but it's I'm gonna make a a a a a choice to stay with them and how Lord in his ministry they're coming this man prophesies over him because you mate that decision that was the right decision it was correct decision not only that it is my way and this because you made this decision is going to make and bring the past the tremendous victory in the love divine I pray that you bring young people both those present and those streaming to a spot where they can make the right choice God is in Jesus name that we pray amen amen praise the Lord amen God bless you I'll turn the service back to your pastor at this time good job if anybody has a need they're getting ready with for the food downstairs this whole world is made out of choices and that's what's so Grand about free moral agency we're not robots we're not zombies we're not no we're not that we're human beings to make a choice he put us here to make a choice and that Rich Young Ruler he thought he had the world in the palm of his hand and he may have for a little while but why would we want to lose our soul just for a little bit of a little bit of a season as as I said about Moses he chose that he chose that and then we got a prophet in the end time he chose right he and and you know we could have said that bro Jack we could have said but God told him through interpretation yes God went ahead and put an exclamation point on it he said it's just not his opinion he said it's my opinion and he's a Mine He's Mine I I'm gonna say in tongues where just not everybody can understand it but a certain group of people aren't you glad that he spoke in tongues to me and you it might have been Kentucky English all right it might have been it might have been Hanks and totes and all those different things but God spoke to us through a prophet amen and we chose Amen to continue to listen there's a lot of people listen that's right but we continue to listen we continue to make that right choice amen brother Brown and preached doors and doors and we've been going through the statue of perfect man you know you get born again you let God in your house they still choices you got to make because God God you know I was telling bro Jack I said now if I was a Holy Ghost and you let me in your house and you had some doors shut I'd be in there kicking them doors down because I want to see what's in there but but thank God for a prophet that said said no the Holy Ghost is timid he's gonna wait on you to make a choice and whether you laid him in the door or not that's your choice I pray today that you laid him in your door
