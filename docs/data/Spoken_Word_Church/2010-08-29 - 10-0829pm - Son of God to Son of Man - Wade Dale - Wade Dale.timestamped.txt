[22:26] it's hard to believe in it
[22:30] but it better not be because that's the
[22:32] only Lord You're Gonna See in human
[22:34] flesh until we get out of here yeah
[22:37] I know

[23:10] that didn't want to come didn't come

[23:14] they didn't want to be here
[23:16] I thank the Lord for that
[23:18] if you got your Bibles we start in the
[23:20] Book of John
[23:21] and just keep us in your prayers
[23:25] we're working about seven days a week
[23:26] you can't work much more than that
[23:31] to make an eight day which I wish we
[23:33] were in and then we wouldn't have to do
[23:35] the other seven
[23:36] but since we're still in this seven
[23:39] we're gonna have to work
[23:41] got off about 8 30 last night went back
[23:43] this morning for a little while so
[23:46] I uh
[23:47] something I hadn't done and
[23:49] years worked on a Sunday but uh
[23:53] circumstances show that we have to every
[23:55] once in a while one of the owners walked
[23:58] in and said well I think
[23:59] I think we've got our Ox in the ditch
[24:01] we're gonna have to get it out
[24:03] I said well that's fine I said but you
[24:05] just don't keep kicking him in on
[24:06] Saturday night so we have to work on
[24:08] Sunday
[24:09] if you let him get in the ditch it's
[24:11] okay for God to say you get him out but
[24:13] if you kick him in a ditch on Saturday
[24:14] night
[24:15] and you then you'd have to get him out
[24:17] so that's a little bit different so he
[24:19] said yeah you're exactly right so but
[24:22] just pray for us
[24:23] John 1
[24:27] let's buy our heads
[24:29] just keep mom in your prayers I ain't
[24:31] seen her in since Monday much so we've

[24:39] dad stuck his head in the door and I
[24:41] felt like Jewel Forney I fell asleep

[24:45] just pray for us the heavenly father we
[24:48] pray Lord that you just be with us
[24:51] take us and Motors into the image that
[24:52] you want us to be in
[24:54] father we know that this is the last and
[24:57] morphe of God that the world will see
[24:59] and we're it's not a joke it's not uh
[25:01] it's not something that's a fantasy
[25:04] world or or something that um
[25:07] that maybe that man has concocted in
[25:10] their mind but it's a reality this is
[25:12] what you wanted
[25:13] this was your mind you wanted to be in a
[25:16] group of people in the end time showing
[25:18] yourself in your word father we pray now
[25:21] that you just take care of each one of
[25:22] us that should strengthen us give us

[25:41] all the doubt and fears away all the
[25:44] anxiety father just be with us take the
[25:48] fear away from each one of us I know in
[25:50] the end time lord we see the pressures
[25:52] of the world and trying to
[25:54] squeeze us Lord but brother random said
[25:57] he said it would squeeze us up and
[26:01] that's what we want to do we want to be
[26:02] squeezed up
[26:03] we want to be caught out of here Lord

[26:10] our many mistakes be with us Lord keep
[26:12] us protect us and we love you
[26:15] because your lovely name is Jesus Christ
[26:17] and that's where all of us say Amen
[26:21] John 1.
[26:23] in the beginning was the word and the
[26:25] Word was with God
[26:27] the Word was God
[26:30] the same was in the beginning with God
[26:34] all things were made by him and without
[26:36] him
[26:38] was not anything made that was made
[26:42] in him was life
[26:44] and the life was the light of men
[26:48] and the light shineth in darkness and
[26:51] the Darkness comprehended at night
[26:54] now let's skip over to verse 9.
[26:57] in other words he's talking about John
[27:00] let's go and read verse six there was a
[27:01] man sent from God whose name was John
[27:04] the same came for a witness to Bear
[27:06] witness of the light now look at that
[27:09] light is capital L so that's not just a
[27:13] false light or a or a flashlight or a
[27:16] moon or a sun or anything that's uh
[27:18] that's a different kind of light
[27:20] that all men through him might believe
[27:23] he was not he was not that like talking
[27:26] about John
[27:27] he was sent to Bear witness of that
[27:29] light
[27:30] that was the True Light capital L which
[27:34] lighteth every man that cometh into the
[27:35] world he was in the world the world was
[27:37] made by him and the world
[27:40] knew him not verse 14. and the Word was
[27:43] made flesh and dwelt among us and we
[27:45] beheld his glory the glory of the only
[27:47] begotten of the father full of grace and
[27:49] truth now one more Colossians one
[27:52] these are all familiar but we're going
[27:54] to set a little basis today and
[27:59] I hate to say prove a point but it says
[28:01] but it's just kind of nail a point home
[28:03] that that maybe we can uh
[28:08] um in our daily life our conversation
[28:10] with other people that
[28:11] will order shine something on our
[28:14] um
[28:15] give us a revelation about what he's
[28:18] trying to say to us all right Colossians
[28:20] 1 verse 15.
[28:23] who is the image of the invisible God
[28:25] the firstborn of every creature
[28:28] every firstborn of every creature for by
[28:32] him were all things created now who's he
[28:34] talking about Christ Jesus Christ
[28:37] excuse me all things created that are in
[28:40] heaven and that are in Earth visible and
[28:43] invisible whether they be Thrones or
[28:45] dominions or principalities or Powers
[28:47] all things created by Him and guess what
[28:50] everything was created for him
[28:53] and he is before all things and by him
[28:56] all things consist or does it consists
[28:58] by the son the s-o-n and he is the head
[29:01] of the body of the church who's the
[29:03] beginning of the first born from the
[29:04] dead now it's talking about Jesus Christ
[29:06] we know that
[29:08] that in all things he might have the
[29:10] preeminence and that's for another
[29:12] um lesson but we'll just stop right
[29:14] there and you may be seated in the Lord
[29:15] has blessings of reading his word
[29:18] we've had there's been some questions I
[29:21] asked
[29:21] um especially to me in different places
[29:23] that uh people not understood what the
[29:27] when we when we
[29:29] um I know Dad's hey he has terminology
[29:31] Brother Richard Wilson they have
[29:33] terminology they have certain things
[29:34] that they say I have certain things that
[29:36] I say there are certain phrases and and
[29:38] things that we say that sometimes that
[29:41] they're not understood
[29:43] so maybe sometimes they need to be
[29:44] explained a little bit more so this
[29:47] we're going to look today and try to I
[29:50] wrote these notes at about 10 45 last
[29:52] night about two pages so
[29:55] it took me about 20 minutes so Terence
[29:57] said I got 25 to preach it so
[30:00] here we go
[30:02] I'm not a Note Reader I don't just read
[30:05] my notes
[30:06] I write a few bullet points down and
[30:08] then I try to fill in between the lines
[30:10] right I believe that's what God Said did
[30:13] in his word he wrote his word but he
[30:15] filled in the lines for an eternity
[30:17] so this word will never go away
[30:18] everything in between the lines is just
[30:20] as Eternal as the lines as long as it
[30:22] lines up with the lines all right so
[30:24] let's go back now to Genesis one what
[30:26] we're going to do today is we're going
[30:28] to take the Son of God in the Old
[30:30] Testament and take him to the son of man
[30:32] in the New Testament but we're going to
[30:34] show that there's there's many things
[30:37] that that the prophet said
[30:40] and we're going to read some quotes
[30:41] about us being The Offspring of God but
[30:44] the whole basis today is going to be on
[30:46] showing that in the Old Testament how in
[30:49] the Old Testament that they were
[30:52] um even Cain was a Son of God by birth
[30:56] natural birth that's right but he was
[30:59] not a son of God by spiritual birth or
[31:01] he had been a born-again Christian
[31:03] Abraham was not a son of God by the new
[31:07] birth he was the son of God by natural
[31:10] birth and he is part of the economy of
[31:12] God he's not a sinner as far as we say
[31:16] that's going to go to hell no Abraham's
[31:18] one of our foundation foundational
[31:19] fathers but he was not a born-again
[31:23] Christian
[31:24] a Son of God by birth not in Genesis 1
[31:28] 26 and 27 person
[31:31] now that's hard for people in this
[31:33] message to swallow
[31:36] believe me
[31:38] I've had phone calls about it
[31:41] but it's true people we got to see who
[31:43] this son of God is and understand
[31:46] that this son of God is not just every
[31:48] person that's born on the face of the
[31:50] Earth
[31:51] but it is every person that's born on
[31:54] the face of the Earth just like Daddy
[31:55] said this morning you know you can make
[31:57] a quote and say Well everybody's the Son
[31:59] of God that's exactly the truth Adolf
[32:02] Hitler was the son of God where'd he
[32:04] come from he was an offspring of God
[32:06] giving him life right but he was not a
[32:10] son of God by the new birth that made
[32:14] him a child of God or an offspring that
[32:17] Paul was saying an offspring of God all
[32:20] right so let's try to understand that
[32:21] Josh where'd Josh go
[32:24] I need some water I didn't bring them up
[32:27] usually I bring my own water up here but
[32:29] I didn't bring my water today so let's
[32:31] go back to Genesis one and let's just
[32:33] look and see
[32:35] where this and it may be Elementary to
[32:38] some but
[32:40] it never hurts to stir up our minds
[32:43] because you can hear something over and
[32:46] over again and you'll say I didn't hear
[32:50] that how many times have you read a book
[32:51] or listen to tape and and a preacher
[32:54] come up and and read a quote out of that
[32:57] same message and you say I just read
[32:59] that last week but I didn't even hear
[33:01] that quote mentioned all right well you
[33:03] know what that's God and his sovereignty
[33:06] he gives it to you in his time not your
[33:08] time all right so in Genesis 1 we got it
[33:12] we must see the physical creation
[33:16] because there was a physical creation
[33:18] right right okay
[33:21] natural creation of man a six day
[33:24] creation
[33:26] that we have to deal with because we
[33:28] have to see that God thank you Sunday
[33:31] school teacher
[33:34] this one's already been open
[33:42] and I do want to um
[33:44] clarify something that that my little
[33:46] brother said in Sunday school class this
[33:48] morning he said that I told him to live
[33:50] because he asked brother Joe and him if
[33:52] I called him I did not when I called my
[33:54] brother yesterday and asked him to do
[33:55] his Sunday school this morning I said I
[33:58] can't find anybody
[34:02] I didn't say I called everybody
[34:07] I was in the middle of a plan in the
[34:10] middle of doing something I said I can't
[34:12] find anybody I didn't say I called
[34:14] brother Joe or call brother Danny or
[34:15] call Brother
[34:16] um Donnie farbush I didn't say that
[34:19] so technically it may have been a little
[34:22] white lie but
[34:23] I guess they're all wise and I do
[34:24] apologize but
[34:26] I just wanted him to see what he could
[34:28] do so I'm gonna get started
[34:30] and after spending eight minutes of
[34:33] telling him about me missing church and
[34:35] telling a lie he had about four minutes
[34:37] of good things to say so
[34:41] he's always been a man of few words
[34:43] anyway so but what he says he means what
[34:46] he says so we thank the Lord for that
[34:49] it's like Dad said well thank God that
[34:51] we got it God's got an economy just like
[34:53] just like governments and he's got
[34:55] people that step in positions and do
[34:57] things and and when you think man we're
[34:59] at the bottom of the barrel we scraped
[35:00] it then here comes down
[35:04] so in the beginning
[35:07] God
[35:09] created the Heaven and the Earth
[35:12] all right and the Earth was without
[35:13] forming board and darkness was upon the
[35:15] face of the deep and the spirit of God
[35:17] moved upon the face of the waters now
[35:19] what is God doing as the prophet is
[35:21] telling us that that God is unfolding
[35:23] himself God has never changed if we
[35:27] believe in in Hebrews 13 8 it says Jesus
[35:31] Christ the same yesterday today and
[35:33] forever
[35:35] God had no new thought or had no new
[35:38] purpose or he didn't come to a place and
[35:41] say oh gosh I messed up I need to start
[35:45] over again right then he always was this
[35:48] Hebrews 13 right amen
[35:51] he always wants the substance of this
[35:54] Hebrews 13 8. now not was not always the
[35:57] flesh God right okay but he created
[36:01] something where he could get his body
[36:02] from right
[36:04] and that Earth isn't
[36:06] Eternal come on
[36:09] cause tell me when this Earth's gonna
[36:10] pass away come on this Earth is not
[36:13] going to be annihilated it's going to be
[36:15] changed right all right man so look at
[36:18] verse 3 and God said we we looked at
[36:20] this in Sunday school and sister Trudy
[36:21] about how to flip and fit back and down
[36:23] in Sunday school but we're going to go
[36:24] over it again just for her
[36:27] and that's sister Trudy McMillan not the
[36:29] other sister Trudy I told Terrence he'd
[36:31] have a problem with sister Trudy I just
[36:32] didn't tell him which one
[36:35] and God said let there be light
[36:38] and there was light now there was no
[36:40] creative act even Schofield picked this
[36:42] up he said let there be light and God
[36:45] saw the light that it was good and God
[36:47] divided the light from the darkness and
[36:49] God called the light look at that
[36:52] capital letter
[36:53] d a y right right
[36:57] not a 24-hour day
[37:00] that's always been the day of the Lord
[37:04] Capital d-a-y that's in the middle of a
[37:06] sentence that's not the first all right
[37:08] and the Darkness he called night Capital
[37:11] nigst what was God doing he was
[37:14] separating himself from Darkness because
[37:17] the absence of light is what Darkness so
[37:22] he didn't create Darkness Darkness is
[37:24] just something that came about because
[37:25] there was no light right now even a man
[37:28] named Albert Einstein proved that he was
[37:31] in college one time I know some of you
[37:33] read it on the internet but that was his
[37:36] question someone was questioning god
[37:38] making Darkness
[37:40] and Albert Einstein proved that Darkness
[37:43] doesn't exist right
[37:45] it only exists
[37:48] because of the absence of light right
[37:51] and this life that God is creating or
[37:54] this God is bringing forth here because
[37:56] remember in verse 14 through about 18 He
[38:01] makes the sun and the moon so this is
[38:03] not the Sun and the Moon that he's that
[38:05] he's bringing forth here right and I
[38:07] want to say bring forth and create and
[38:09] bring forth kind of makes people kind of
[38:10] loopy you know but create is to bring
[38:13] something that never was God can't bring
[38:16] something that there never was if it was
[38:18] his light for this is God's light that
[38:20] he's talking about right here this is
[38:21] not the Sun and the Moon that we see as
[38:24] natural l-i-g-h-t because remember in
[38:26] verse 16 God made two great lights right
[38:29] sun and moon so in this Genesis 1 I
[38:33] believe this is where the Prophet comes
[38:34] down and he sees that God he starts out
[38:37] and that logos comes out and begins to
[38:39] create right because he separates
[38:41] himself from Satan way before he even
[38:43] starts the creation of the world
[38:45] so it creates the day from the night
[38:48] it's going to be the day of the Lord and
[38:49] the night of the devil if you want to
[38:51] call it that but here's where the Son of
[38:53] God begins to show himself
[38:57] he begins to let us understand that hey
[39:00] I'm not making a sun in the Moon
[39:03] I'm showing you who I am
[39:05] my life
[39:07] which is eternal life and then there's
[39:09] darkness that comes because of the
[39:12] absence of this eternal life
[39:15] that's why hell is not eternal
[39:18] because it's going to go away one day
[39:20] it's going to just completely disappear
[39:22] and even if you look down I even noticed
[39:25] the other day look in verse 10 even the
[39:28] earth and the Seas has capital letters I
[39:31] don't believe these things are going to
[39:32] go away these things that God has
[39:34] created are going to stay here
[39:37] all right the six days of creation God's
[39:40] never going to do away with any of those
[39:42] right now it fell
[39:44] right it became sinful
[39:46] death ruled all through all these uh
[39:49] even in the grass and trees and and the
[39:54] whales that he created all those things
[39:56] we know death but
[39:58] nothing has nothing has stopped right
[40:01] everything's still going just like
[40:02] you're supposed to uh an eternal God
[40:04] doesn't say something
[40:06] and then it go away and never come back
[40:08] all right so now we get though to
[40:11] Genesis 1 26.
[40:14] and we see that
[40:17] God has come to a place
[40:20] that he's bringing a condition
[40:23] yeah
[40:24] now
[40:26] this light that we're talking about that
[40:28] God show or this day which is not which
[40:30] is daytime all right which is day which
[40:32] is light because we read that in Genesis
[40:34] 1 what he was the creator of God and in
[40:36] him was light and that light was capital
[40:38] l i g h t right
[40:42] which is not a son or a moon
[40:44] but now watch
[40:46] God Is So connected to his creation that
[40:49] he never come apart from it
[40:51] and we're looking at Redemption and
[40:54] we're showing maybe down in the Sunday
[40:55] school class we'll get into this more
[40:56] but we're going to take the Son of God
[40:59] because we took
[41:01] to me it helps to parallel something
[41:03] and your brother Brandon had a way of
[41:06] doing it that he could take an example
[41:08] and he could take these take this
[41:10] example and he could move it through a
[41:12] sermon and he would bring out what he
[41:13] wanted to what he wanted to say he
[41:15] started with this example like we
[41:17] started with the Millennium a millennium
[41:19] is a tie for the future home but there's
[41:21] things in the Millennium that want
[41:23] migrate or move over into the future
[41:26] home and there's things in the future
[41:27] home that won't be in the millennium
[41:30] but if you'll compare the two you'll see
[41:33] how God is I hate to say evolving but he
[41:36] is God is evolving he's evolving because
[41:39] even through Creative Evolution he was
[41:41] he was evolving he wasn't evolving amen
[41:45] you're in my intelligence maybe I can
[41:48] say is evolving because God doesn't
[41:49] evolve
[41:51] D he always was always well-being can't
[41:54] be any different so he's not evolving
[41:56] but he wants us to evolve because one
[41:59] thing's for sure if if if we drop an ink
[42:03] pen on the floor
[42:05] and we reached down and picked that ink
[42:07] pen up it's got to come back to the same
[42:09] place
[42:11] to be fully restored
[42:13] so if I drop the ink pen and if I pick
[42:16] it up going to only take it a couple
[42:17] inches and lay it on a Shelf
[42:19] because running around made the
[42:21] illustration he said I dropped this book
[42:22] and pick up a pencil he said that's not
[42:24] bringing back what was like what was
[42:26] dropped
[42:27] but I go a little bit further if that
[42:30] book don't come back to the original
[42:31] condition that it was then before then
[42:34] it's not fully restored because if you
[42:36] take that book and you take care and you
[42:38] knock it off and it hits the floor and
[42:39] you pick it up and go lay it over here
[42:41] that's not restoring it back to its
[42:43] original condition right its original
[42:45] condition was right here so that's why
[42:48] God in this Creation in the in the Book
[42:50] of Genesis remember that's the C chapter
[42:52] so we're all going back to that
[42:55] that's what we're going back to when we
[42:57] get back to the future home we're going
[42:58] to get back to be able to read Genesis 1
[43:01] through 27 28 and on in there and then
[43:05] we'll be able to say hey we're standing
[43:06] in it right now
[43:08] that's just the way I believe because
[43:09] that's fully redeemed that's bringing it
[43:12] right back to where God wanted it to be
[43:14] but God to be a
[43:17] Savior and a Healer and all those things
[43:19] we know that the fall had to happen but
[43:21] he never pulled his or disconnected
[43:23] himself from the creation of man
[43:26] he was always connected to the creation
[43:28] because remember in Romans 8 we get over
[43:31] that Romans 8 right down at the end of
[43:34] time for you and me
[43:35] and it says the whole creation is
[43:37] groaning
[43:38] waiting for what the manifestation of
[43:41] the Sons and Daughters of God
[43:42] now it's grown for thousands of years
[43:47] Adam was going to
[43:50] not let the fall happen or our atom was
[43:53] not going to be the one that
[43:55] that destroyed the thing he was the one
[43:56] that was going to keep it the way it
[43:57] should have been
[43:58] supposed to have right
[44:01] being Son of God that's what he was
[44:02] going to do he was going to keep it as a
[44:04] condition that God had because you and I
[44:06] the same way here on Earth We're
[44:07] stewards of the earth and being stewards
[44:10] of the Earth We're supposed to keep this
[44:11] in this close to an even condition as we
[44:13] can I know we do a bad job of it but
[44:16] still the whole creation is groaning
[44:19] waiting on what you and I
[44:21] to get back to that condition to where
[44:24] Adam can look and say to remove
[44:27] line go lay down
[44:30] bird
[44:32] you know don't fly this way fly that you
[44:34] know that was Adam's condition that was
[44:36] God's harmony with his creation Glory
[44:39] all right now but now this son of God
[44:42] was a spirit God but when we when we say
[44:46] you know brother Brown said well he was
[44:47] Son of God through the old through the
[44:49] uh Church ages we think of spirit god
[44:52] well it was Spirit God but it was God
[44:54] still dwelling in people right
[44:58] but there was a situation that and it's
[45:02] like I told the brother I said it's just
[45:05] so simple for people stumble over it
[45:07] right
[45:08] because after the fall
[45:12] God took the ability to all for all this
[45:15] to come about he took that away from
[45:17] Adam and there was enmity or a division
[45:20] now I was thinking about today this
[45:23] morning when Dad was speaking on Genesis
[45:24] 3 15 that when he said that I'm going to
[45:27] put enmity between thy see that one that
[45:32] one verse of scripture
[45:34] covered 6 000 years
[45:38] you said I don't know there's only four
[45:40] to Jesus no we're the ending of this
[45:43] creation amen let's don't stop it at 4
[45:47] 000 years that one scripture was six
[45:49] thousand years because the the scripture
[45:52] says he was going to bruise the head of
[45:54] the serpent we know he did that at
[45:56] Calvary potentially but like Dad said
[45:59] excuse me Wednesday night apart it's not
[46:01] a pardon unless it's accepted right
[46:03] there's nobody knew how to really accept
[46:06] this full pardon until right now right
[46:09] and that's the pardon of this guy you're
[46:11] looking at right here they didn't have a
[46:13] problem pardoning the inside guy the Son
[46:15] of God right down Through the Ages it
[46:17] cleaned up the man's soul that was okay
[46:19] because people understood that Paul and
[46:21] all had a great understanding but still
[46:23] Paul looked to the groaning of this man
[46:25] the one you're looking at here right
[46:28] grown within ourselves waiting for what
[46:31] the adoption to wet the Redemption of
[46:33] the body so let's go to Hebrews 9
[46:36] because
[46:38] folks the problem
[46:42] I tell you what the biggest problem is
[46:45] a lack of teaching
[46:48] and brothers I tell you what I pulled a
[46:51] daddy
[46:53] where's brother Mark
[46:55] and come back
[46:56] no okay
[46:58] I pulled a day I got to talk to this
[47:00] brother and he was he was just couldn't
[47:03] understand that that Abraham wasn't a
[47:06] Son of God just like we are
[47:08] and I got to talking to him and Donnie
[47:10] brother Donnie walked up and brother
[47:11] Mark walked up
[47:13] I said brother what you need is a good
[47:15] case of teaching
[47:16] so he goes rattling off about something
[47:18] and I just slip outside and left Donnie
[47:21] and and mark
[47:23] right and I just went on back and
[47:25] started doing stuff in the kitchen over
[47:27] at the uh when we were doing the cooking
[47:29] at brother burley's camp and uh left
[47:31] them to the fight a little bit so
[47:35] I got it started so I let them try to
[47:37] fit and you know come finish it but you
[47:39] know people getting Watch What Happens
[47:41] we've talked we were starting to talk
[47:44] about Abraham
[47:46] and this brother started on
[47:47] predestination he said I know that was
[47:50] that that that there's predefinition and
[47:53] and it's by four dollars he said but I
[47:55] just know I was this seed before the
[47:57] foundation of the world and there's no
[47:59] way I could have come except this way
[48:01] thank you
[48:02] well you know what
[48:05] and he was talking about Peter and all
[48:07] the apostles I said well I said so they
[48:09] were all predestinated
[48:11] Eternal seed of God
[48:13] Walking With Jesus
[48:16] on shores of Galilee
[48:18] oh yeah brother
[48:19] and I wished I'd have told him this one
[48:21] thing because Daddy brought it out this
[48:22] morning why did Peter why did Peter have
[48:25] to put it in the Eternal Word of God if
[48:27] he was always this seed and he was this
[48:30] eternal person with God before he was
[48:32] born again
[48:34] why did he come to Second Peter 1 19 and
[48:37] say I now have a more sure word of
[48:40] Prophecy right right why didn't he just
[48:43] say bless God I was on the mountain with
[48:45] God
[48:46] I saw God I understood the whole program
[48:50] if he was just some
[48:53] couldn't go come any other way Eternal
[48:55] see to God why didn't he understand it
[48:57] then right right why did they have a
[49:00] problem why did all of them have a
[49:01] problem with Jesus every time he turned
[49:03] around he was rebuking them and telling
[49:05] them you know
[49:09] all he had to do was look at him and say
[49:11] Hey You Was Born This Way
[49:13] he was born right to begin with but no
[49:15] you were not right
[49:17] you were born wrong amen but God
[49:23] in Hebrews 9
[49:25] to me this explains the whole program
[49:29] of the Old Testament and we'll read some
[49:32] quotes in just a minute but let's turn
[49:33] to Hebrews 9.
[49:35] it all comes down to blood
[49:39] our soul
[49:43] blood and soul
[49:46] because an animal does not have a soul
[49:49] animal has life in his blood but he does
[49:52] not have eternal life in his blood
[49:55] he does not have a saving power
[50:00] so therefore nobody in the Old Testament
[50:03] we can stop right now
[50:05] nobody in the Old Testament had the
[50:08] blood of Jesus Christ to take their sins
[50:10] away
[50:12] sure they were looking forward to it
[50:15] but they had a substitute right and
[50:18] under a substitute that does not make a
[50:21] son and daughter of God right God don't
[50:23] have substitute Sons and Daughters amen
[50:30] blessing
[50:31] you know I didn't mind when The
[50:33] Substitute Teacher came to school when
[50:34] the teacher was sick right but you could
[50:37] play
[50:37] but when that real teacher came yeah
[50:41] you better not play
[50:44] so I don't like substitutes
[50:47] or I did it you know personally but
[50:49] substitutes don't do you any good but
[50:51] the real teachers the one that does you
[50:53] good but in Hebrews 9 it explains
[50:57] Cox amount of Tabernacle and when when
[50:59] God in the Old Testament when he when he
[51:03] saw that man couldn't make it
[51:06] Adam's blood
[51:09] that what anybody says in the message
[51:10] Adam's blood or his sperm
[51:13] cannot save anybody right right
[51:16] the Bible said in Adam all died
[51:22] because he didn't even have a Saving
[51:23] Grace right as far as to save somebody
[51:26] else God had to save him
[51:31] I wish people could see that it's just
[51:33] it just well if you don't get a
[51:35] revelation it's I guess it is kind of
[51:37] Muddy or murky looking or you can't put
[51:39] it together but
[51:41] but the Bible speaks of a tabernacle God
[51:44] was showing
[51:46] how that this thing was going to evolve
[51:48] down through time but it was only people
[51:52] a shadow
[51:54] are a substitute of things to come let's
[51:57] let's read any let's start in in verse
[52:00] 10 maybe work our way backwards
[52:03] for the law having a shadow of good
[52:06] things to come and not the very image
[52:10] in other words of the thing that God
[52:12] wanted
[52:15] because God didn't want animal blood
[52:18] as a sacrifice
[52:21] he knew it would only take his blood
[52:23] that could do it all right
[52:25] and he's the only man that could give
[52:27] his life right
[52:30] amen and have enough
[52:32] of the eternal life in it right to come
[52:35] back on you and I right right because
[52:37] Abraham I mean excuse me Adam did not
[52:40] resurrect that's right that's right bruh
[52:43] Adam did not say destroy this body and
[52:46] I'll raise it up right he didn't come to
[52:49] that position right
[52:51] right before he could have come to that
[52:53] position
[52:54] that's where Satan came in oh yeah and
[52:57] he put that division between God and man
[52:59] the enmity which is between our two ears
[53:01] right all right
[53:03] but the long having a shadow of good
[53:05] things to come and not the very image of
[53:07] the things can never
[53:10] and the Bible is precise can never
[53:15] with these sacrifices which they offered
[53:19] year by year continually make the comer
[53:22] there into perfect
[53:28] though Abraham in God's eyes was perfect
[53:31] yeah
[53:33] but Abraham was not going to be in this
[53:37] Genesis 1
[53:39] God in human flesh walking on the face
[53:42] of the earth a son of God
[53:44] Son of God by natural birth sure a
[53:48] person that God thought so much of that
[53:50] he put him in the Eternal Word of God
[53:52] but he also put Judas in the Eternal
[53:53] Word of God
[53:55] but he thought more of Abraham because
[53:56] Abraham believed right but Abraham so
[54:00] believed but still Abraham there's no
[54:03] way God had made this plan so perfect
[54:08] to the calmer therefore could not be
[54:11] perfect by any kind of other blood than
[54:14] human blood right
[54:16] it had to be even in their law that's
[54:19] why that that folks it's so simple if
[54:22] you look at it the law of redemption
[54:24] that we that we look at in Boaz and and
[54:27] Ruth it had to be a Kinsmen right
[54:31] Abraham didn't have a Kinsmen to die for
[54:34] him Abraham had a substitute a lamb a
[54:38] ram a turtle dove a pigeon all these
[54:41] things that was just uh even God come to
[54:44] the place where he said I'm tired of
[54:46] that I don't want to smell no more that
[54:48] smoke
[54:50] but just think of it
[54:53] that animal
[54:56] died in innocence
[54:59] right
[55:00] to give you a Hope anyway
[55:04] and it wasn't a pretty sight right
[55:07] I mean reading the Bible about how they
[55:09] had to do with it I mean all of you have
[55:11] seen insides of animals
[55:13] and having to burn them
[55:15] and make sacrifices and God said it was
[55:18] a sweet smelling savior at one time in
[55:20] other words that was what he wanted at
[55:22] that time because he had not come in his
[55:25] time yet
[55:27] to bring the Bible says many sons unto
[55:30] himself
[55:31] the Bible is very plain if you'll walk
[55:33] through the Bible because look for then
[55:35] verse 2 would they not would they not
[55:38] have ceased to be offered right if it
[55:41] made the comer they're into perfect the
[55:43] first time he made a sacrifice if that
[55:46] was the perfect sacrifice he would not
[55:49] have made another one
[55:51] for then would they not have ceased to
[55:54] be offered Paul would say it watch
[55:59] because that the worshiper wants purged
[56:02] that was their problem
[56:04] the people in the Old Testament could
[56:06] not get their self-purged by an animal
[56:10] blood right or an animal life
[56:17] once per should have had no more
[56:19] conscience of sins
[56:26] but in those sacrifices there is a
[56:28] remembrance
[56:30] again made of sins every year
[56:35] and the Bible continues on and tells us
[56:37] that you know he prepared God prepared a
[56:39] body for him but look at verse 4.
[56:45] for it is not possible
[56:48] now there's your that's a definite
[56:52] sister Trudy it did not matter if they
[56:54] rolled in that blood or took any kind of
[56:56] animal done whatever they could
[57:00] it was not possible that the blood of
[57:03] bulletin of goat should take away sins
[57:09] so the Old Testament people
[57:13] whether you like it or not
[57:16] God said I'm not going to dwell in an
[57:18] unclean vessel
[57:20] that sacrifice in the Old Testament
[57:23] though it did marvelous things it did
[57:26] not make the comer perfect right right
[57:28] because there was a remembrance of sin
[57:31] every year when that priest took that
[57:33] blood and when they walked it was a it
[57:35] was a scene the whole place come out all
[57:39] of Israel got around the ark or or the
[57:43] the Tabernacle and that one man showing
[57:46] that it would take one man
[57:47] that one man
[57:50] took animal blood behind the veil and
[57:52] God said you've stayed my wrath for one
[57:55] more year
[57:58] but that didn't
[58:00] negate
[58:01] the next year
[58:03] him doing the same thing over again
[58:07] because there was a remembrance of sins
[58:11] that's what it says right here
[58:13] verse three in those sacrifices there's
[58:16] a remembrance again made of sins every
[58:21] year
[58:22] for it is not possible is the blood of
[58:24] bulls and of goats should take away sins
[58:26] foreign
[58:30] out here we're coming down to a man
[58:32] sacrificing offering now when it's not
[58:35] but a body has to help prepare me right
[58:37] now let's read what the prophet said
[58:39] let's read a few quotes I gave Joe a
[58:41] bunch but we're not going to read them
[58:42] all brother Joe we'll just skip through
[58:44] save time and Abraham restored let's
[58:47] know what the prophet said in 1961
[58:49] to 11.
[58:52] he's talking about when they offered a
[58:53] sin offering they took a little lamb
[58:55] laid their hands upon it confessed their
[58:57] sins and they cut its throat and when
[58:59] the little fellow was dying kicking and
[59:01] bleeding while the blood got all over
[59:03] the hands of the worshiper and then he
[59:05] felt the death going out of that animal
[59:07] as it straightened out and died and he
[59:09] knowed that that animal was dying in
[59:11] this place but the Bible said he went
[59:14] out with the same desire he had when he
[59:17] come in that is not a son of God by New
[59:21] Birth
[59:24] because we're gonna read in a little
[59:25] while the same thing that that brother
[59:28] was quoting this morning
[59:29] that if the seed remains in you you
[59:32] can't sin
[59:38] because see when the that blood cell was
[59:41] broke that animal spirit could not come
[59:44] back and coincide with a human Spirit
[59:47] right exactly the animal has no soul
[59:51] so they could not come back so therefore
[59:54] he went out
[59:56] with the same conscience
[59:59] but when a man by faith comes lays his
[1:00:01] hand on the head of Jesus Christ and
[1:00:03] fills his suffering in other words a
[1:00:04] Calvary what does he say and when that
[1:00:07] blood cell was broke not only the life
[1:00:09] of a human being came back but the life
[1:00:11] of almighty God amen amen and makes you
[1:00:15] a son and daughter of God now that ought
[1:00:17] to settlement like brother Brown said
[1:00:19] the other day he was reading he said he
[1:00:21] said one miracle in this building ought
[1:00:23] to settle it he said we ought to not
[1:00:24] have to have any more discernment
[1:00:26] but he said human beings he said we're
[1:00:29] gonna have to have some more in other
[1:00:30] words that's what he did
[1:00:33] he said overseas one one outstanding
[1:00:36] Miracle he said that settled it he said
[1:00:37] in America you have to keep going over
[1:00:39] and over again
[1:00:42] listen sir as we would see Jesus 1964.
[1:00:46] Abraham was considered a god
[1:00:49] now see he has no problem
[1:00:51] right
[1:00:52] I have no problem with this
[1:00:56] Abraham was considered a god
[1:00:58] Elijah was a god Isaiah was a God
[1:01:02] because the word of God came to them and
[1:01:05] they were in portion Gods right Jesus
[1:01:09] said they were now you see when the man
[1:01:12] was anointed like Joseph he portrayed
[1:01:14] Christ
[1:01:15] right portrayed
[1:01:18] right if we portray Christ now we're
[1:01:22] anti christ amen yes yeah look at the
[1:01:26] difference the dispensation change
[1:01:29] from the Son of God to the son of man
[1:01:30] because he's bringing him and human
[1:01:31] flesh right now
[1:01:33] you see the man like Joseph he portrayed
[1:01:36] Christ when Moses was anointed was
[1:01:38] anointed he portrayed Christ
[1:01:41] Glory there's no problem with this
[1:01:44] when David was anointed he portrayed
[1:01:46] Christ
[1:01:47] all leading up to Christ
[1:01:50] and he was the fullness of the word
[1:01:53] amen the word was made manifest in him
[1:01:56] he was the complete anointed one
[1:01:59] they had it by portion we have it by
[1:02:01] portion he was the anointed one the
[1:02:03] entire plan of God laid in him God's
[1:02:06] listen God's plan before the foundation
[1:02:09] of the world to redeem a lost world was
[1:02:12] in Jesus Christ amen
[1:02:15] so the blood of bulls and goats never
[1:02:19] never
[1:02:21] but now listen to what brother Branham
[1:02:23] did say about Old Testament now look
[1:02:27] he's talking about them coming out of
[1:02:29] paradise now see that was another that's
[1:02:32] another thing you can look at is
[1:02:34] Paradise
[1:02:36] brother Brown said God put him in
[1:02:38] Paradise because they couldn't come
[1:02:40] before God and the condition that they
[1:02:42] were in
[1:02:44] that's Abraham Isaac Jacob Joseph Hall
[1:02:46] and it doesn't matter that's all the Old
[1:02:49] Testament people all right
[1:02:52] brother Brown said he said father these
[1:02:56] are those that died in good faith
[1:02:59] all right
[1:03:01] see today
[1:03:04] we can't just die in good faith
[1:03:09] Faith once delivered to the Saints now
[1:03:10] listen to this
[1:03:16] Faith once delivered to the Saints
[1:03:17] Chicago 1955 501 now we couldn't go to
[1:03:21] the Old Testament because they wasn't
[1:03:24] called Saints in the Old Testament
[1:03:28] they were Saints in the New Testament
[1:03:32] therefore we'd have to begin from the
[1:03:34] New Testament
[1:03:35] well then the New Testament was based
[1:03:38] upon Christianity which come from Christ
[1:03:40] and Christ was the first ministrator of
[1:03:43] faith that we should contend for because
[1:03:45] it was the faith that he introduced to
[1:03:48] the world
[1:03:50] that's pretty tough
[1:03:53] often Perfection let me read more
[1:03:55] perfection 1957.
[1:03:57] 419 all through the Old Testament they
[1:04:00] offered the blood of lambs and goats
[1:04:03] sheeps bulls and Heifers
[1:04:04] a substitutionary death
[1:04:07] but all in the great economy of God he
[1:04:10] said
[1:04:11] there was back in his mind the real
[1:04:14] object coming
[1:04:17] which would be them were Shadows of the
[1:04:20] real object that was to come
[1:04:22] and the real object was to come was his
[1:04:25] only begotten son all the Lambs that
[1:04:28] died was only a shadow and a shadow is
[1:04:31] only the negative side of an object
[1:04:35] and they all spoke of Calvary coming
[1:04:39] and man cannot do it in himself he's a
[1:04:43] total failure
[1:04:45] God let him see that through the law
[1:04:48] through the judges and through all the
[1:04:51] Old Testament
[1:04:54] he sent the prophet he sent the
[1:04:56] righteous man and they find out that
[1:04:59] everyone
[1:05:00] failed right
[1:05:02] right so God by his Sovereign Grace sent
[1:05:05] from the portals of Glory his only
[1:05:07] begotten son to take
[1:05:09] our place
[1:05:15] let me read one more this is good hear
[1:05:17] you him 1958 209
[1:05:20] Moses represented the law
[1:05:23] no man can be saved by the law
[1:05:27] everything that you do legally that's
[1:05:30] legalistic
[1:05:32] you can't do nothing to save yourself
[1:05:35] it takes the grace of God to save you no
[1:05:40] matter what you do you're doing it in
[1:05:42] yourself amen
[1:05:45] nothing to do with it with it it won't
[1:05:48] be long till you'll be just like uh he
[1:05:51] said in other words that's what happens
[1:05:53] to the church
[1:05:56] that's exactly what they're done they
[1:05:57] got into all the do's and don'ts and
[1:05:59] forgot about God
[1:06:01] but
[1:06:04] do you get what I'm saying do you get
[1:06:06] what the prophet was saying right all
[1:06:08] the animal blood all the things that
[1:06:10] happened in the Old Testament was a
[1:06:11] substitutionary was a shadow
[1:06:14] are a negative of the positive that was
[1:06:17] to come amen but the negative is not a
[1:06:19] negative like
[1:06:21] a bad negative right a negative of a
[1:06:24] picture is not bad right because it
[1:06:26] develops what the picture is right all
[1:06:27] right same thing with the Old Testament
[1:06:29] it was a type or a shadow that was going
[1:06:33] to lead
[1:06:35] lead into this man coming in human flesh
[1:06:39] because had not the Old Testament come
[1:06:41] as a platform that's why the prophet
[1:06:43] said it was a typologist he typed
[1:06:45] everything back into the Old Testament
[1:06:46] right because that gives the revelation
[1:06:49] of the New Testament but the Old
[1:06:51] Testament was a shadow
[1:06:53] it showed that Abraham had
[1:06:56] characteristics of a Son of God right
[1:06:58] Isaiah had characteristics of a Son of
[1:07:01] God God could use him to the fullest
[1:07:05] but he couldn't say the soul
[1:07:09] he couldn't be a son of the son or
[1:07:11] daughter of God by birth right
[1:07:15] by birthing us into a kingdom
[1:07:18] had to have the death of a testator for
[1:07:22] The Testament to be enforced right and
[1:07:24] then we're going to read in just a
[1:07:26] minute in the in the Book of John where
[1:07:28] it says the Holy Ghost had not been
[1:07:30] given because Jesus had not been
[1:07:31] glorified
[1:07:35] so here let's back up just a minute
[1:07:37] let's take this son of God down to the
[1:07:39] son of man maybe we'll kind of carry on
[1:07:41] this maybe a little bit later but this
[1:07:43] son of God was a spirit God that's what
[1:07:45] Jehovah was right Jehovah was one that
[1:07:48] would come in a cloud he would come in a
[1:07:50] in a form or even the captain of the
[1:07:53] host even even uh the great Melchizedek
[1:07:57] was not your savior right but when that
[1:08:00] savior walked the face of the Earth
[1:08:02] Melchizedek was in that person right
[1:08:04] right and it wasn't two persons I heard
[1:08:06] somebody the other day see I said boy
[1:08:07] what makes him with a dual identity no I
[1:08:09] don't he's not schizophrenic
[1:08:13] God's got one identity right God's got
[1:08:16] one person that's right and he was the
[1:08:17] person of Jesus Christ almighty God Amen
[1:08:20] right but in Hebrews it shows us exactly
[1:08:24] that the that the even in verse 9 if
[1:08:27] you'll keep reading the lo I come to do
[1:08:28] thy will o God he taketh away the first
[1:08:33] Old Testament all right
[1:08:35] that he may establish the second he
[1:08:38] takes away the old creation or the old
[1:08:40] part that he that come up in the
[1:08:43] evolution of God just like God evolved
[1:08:45] in six days of creation he's evolved in
[1:08:47] six thousand years or of growth coming
[1:08:50] to you and I in this end time right all
[1:08:52] right took six days now take six
[1:08:54] thousand years to bring us to a place to
[1:08:57] where he can show his fullness his full
[1:08:59] creative ability right because remember
[1:09:03] we're part of a new creation
[1:09:06] yeah that's right a new race of people
[1:09:08] right it's never been on the face of the
[1:09:11] Earth before a new race of people
[1:09:15] not saying that Abraham was not worthy
[1:09:18] right
[1:09:19] right read Hebrews 11 right the Bible
[1:09:23] says the world let's read it we got a
[1:09:26] little bit from Hebrews 11. it's just
[1:09:28] right there across the pages who got
[1:09:30] Hebrews 10.
[1:09:31] all these great people by Faith by faith
[1:09:35] through faith by faith through faith
[1:09:37] by faith through faith verse 37.
[1:09:40] they were stoned they were Sean asunder
[1:09:43] and that was Isaiah tempted slain with a
[1:09:46] sword wandered about sheepskin and goat
[1:09:48] skin being destitute Afflicted tormented
[1:09:50] it looked like a pretty terrible group
[1:09:51] of people right now but guess what
[1:09:54] of whom the world who's not even Worthy
[1:09:58] for them to be here
[1:10:05] they wandered in desert in the mountains
[1:10:07] and dens and caves of the Earth
[1:10:10] now these are the great powers of faith
[1:10:13] all of these were Old Testament people
[1:10:18] right
[1:10:19] not in New Testament in here brother
[1:10:20] it's the Old Testament amen right
[1:10:23] verse 39 says it all
[1:10:26] and these all having obtained a good
[1:10:29] report through faith receive not
[1:10:34] it's a promise
[1:10:35] right
[1:10:37] the promise was that God was going to
[1:10:40] restore somebody back to an Adam
[1:10:42] condition
[1:10:44] which was a man walking around on the
[1:10:46] face of the Earth the god of the Earth
[1:10:48] with God in his soul right because
[1:10:51] that's what Adam was
[1:10:53] he was God of this Earth
[1:10:55] he was not a born-again Christian
[1:10:57] because he wasn't born but God put
[1:11:00] eternal life in his soul just like he
[1:11:01] does mine and yours sure
[1:11:04] right right amen because that's what
[1:11:07] he's saying right here the promise was
[1:11:10] in Genesis 3 15 was to restore and take
[1:11:13] away the works of the devil and put
[1:11:16] everything back to where it should be
[1:11:18] amen right right
[1:11:21] a bunch of little animals walk around
[1:11:22] but now brother Brown said a bunch of
[1:11:24] little Jesus was walking around
[1:11:26] because Jesus hadn't come yet
[1:11:29] Adam was a type
[1:11:32] but in all things Adam couldn't type
[1:11:33] Christ right he taught Christ in the way
[1:11:36] that he wanted to go out and get his
[1:11:37] wife but brother Brown said he got out
[1:11:39] of the garden
[1:11:41] he did the right thing by taking his
[1:11:43] wife
[1:11:44] but he couldn't get back in right amen
[1:11:47] why
[1:11:50] the tree of life the way had been cut
[1:11:52] off right
[1:11:55] and guess what we're standing there
[1:11:58] that light right that was in Genesis 1 3
[1:12:01] right we're standing there
[1:12:03] and there's no way that they could get
[1:12:06] back through animal blood
[1:12:08] but when that light that's why we read
[1:12:10] John 1 when that light came to the world
[1:12:12] and became human flesh what do you say I
[1:12:15] am the way the truth in life are like
[1:12:18] right in other words I'm the way that
[1:12:20] you can get back into that amen it's
[1:12:23] just so simple it's really people if if
[1:12:27] Satan can destroy
[1:12:31] Redemption
[1:12:32] right yeah
[1:12:34] if he what he done in the Garden of Eden
[1:12:37] was he stopped Sons and Daughters of God
[1:12:40] from being born on the Earth right like
[1:12:42] God wanted them
[1:12:46] he plugged up the womb of Eve so she
[1:12:49] could not bear you and I
[1:12:52] all right
[1:12:53] and that's what he's trying to do now
[1:12:55] through the womb of your mind
[1:12:58] he's trying to pollute the womb of your
[1:12:59] mind and close it up and stop another
[1:13:01] son and daughter of God from coming
[1:13:03] forward he hasn't stopped his plan
[1:13:06] he just went at a couple of different
[1:13:08] angles now he's the best of the best
[1:13:11] listen there ain't no like you except
[1:13:13] Jesus Christ I mean ain't nobody brother
[1:13:16] Brown said don't try to outsmart him
[1:13:17] that's right because he already knows
[1:13:22] but
[1:13:23] God said I'll make a way but what the
[1:13:25] devil I don't think what the devil saw
[1:13:27] was was that God was going to hide
[1:13:30] himself right back into the thing that
[1:13:32] that he that Satan used
[1:13:35] to create the fall of Man or to cause
[1:13:38] the fall of Man God had
[1:13:41] had
[1:13:43] to come back through that to redeem it
[1:13:45] right
[1:13:46] he couldn't come around another way or
[1:13:48] Melchizedek could have done it
[1:13:50] Melchizedek could have been Our Redeemer
[1:13:52] if God hadn't said well if the wounds
[1:13:55] polluted here I've got to come back
[1:13:57] through the womb to take care of the
[1:13:58] problem going back in this direction
[1:14:01] everybody understand that
[1:14:02] God can't go wrong he won't go around
[1:14:04] something that's right
[1:14:07] that's not Redemption remember drop this
[1:14:10] on the floor set it over here
[1:14:12] that would be Melchizedek right right
[1:14:14] they say oh well he can do it he can do
[1:14:16] it this way no if you drop that you got
[1:14:19] to pick that up if I was about 20 years
[1:14:21] younger I would drop that and pick that
[1:14:24] back up and if it was sitting right here
[1:14:25] I got to put it back in the same place
[1:14:27] not just and I dropped it and picked it
[1:14:30] up and have it in my hand
[1:14:32] no no you got to put it back in the same
[1:14:34] spot now I have restored this bottle cap
[1:14:37] back to its original condition
[1:14:39] sitting right here where it was right
[1:14:42] right and that's what God did Adam
[1:14:43] couldn't do it no one could do it except
[1:14:46] himself he said this is so Elementary
[1:14:48] but this is how Satan has wove his plan
[1:14:52] in the people of the message
[1:14:55] I ain't talking about people out in the
[1:14:57] world you can't even talk to people you
[1:14:58] can't even I'm talking to somebody the
[1:15:00] other day a Baptist guy we were going to
[1:15:01] that
[1:15:02] uh funeral there of John and uh
[1:15:07] just some simple things
[1:15:09] blows their minds amen just blowing
[1:15:12] their mind
[1:15:13] you know even talking about it I can't
[1:15:15] even remember what we was talking about
[1:15:16] but I was like
[1:15:17] if you never read that in the Bible
[1:15:20] I talked about some doctrinal issue I
[1:15:23] don't know about just something that
[1:15:24] happened in the life of Jesus or the
[1:15:26] life of John or the life of somebody and
[1:15:29] it just blows their brain oh yes and
[1:15:32] here we are but you know why
[1:15:36] because their wounds been cut off
[1:15:39] Eve can only go so far
[1:15:41] and when that wound got polluted God
[1:15:44] couldn't come through that he won't come
[1:15:45] through an unclean vessel that's what I
[1:15:48] stopped him right there in the garden
[1:15:49] but he said I'll
[1:15:51] come back
[1:15:53] as a seed of the woman well where did he
[1:15:55] have to go the seat of the woman was not
[1:15:57] Melchizedek because he wasn't born from
[1:15:59] a woman right a seat of the woman had to
[1:16:01] come through a womb through creative
[1:16:02] through creation
[1:16:05] and come right back through the creation
[1:16:06] brother random said the Creator become
[1:16:09] the creation
[1:16:11] that's the only way you can take us back
[1:16:12] brother then he couldn't just come and
[1:16:14] be formed on a rock or come down from
[1:16:16] glory and just say here I am
[1:16:18] I've come to save the world
[1:16:21] that wasn't God's plan
[1:16:23] God's plan was he said I'm going to live
[1:16:25] just like you are amen amen I told
[1:16:27] somebody the other day I said it's a
[1:16:29] hard thing
[1:16:31] and that's what I was telling somebody I
[1:16:33] said you know every once in a while
[1:16:35] and God forgive me but this is what I do
[1:16:37] I just kind of take the Holy Ghost and
[1:16:38] set him over on the Shelf somewhere and
[1:16:40] I kind of think Carnival
[1:16:46] all right we got this God that don't
[1:16:48] need anybody
[1:16:50] think women here just you know don't
[1:16:52] just think human we're just thinking
[1:16:54] human here's this here's this being that
[1:16:57] that creates worlds not just speaking
[1:17:01] he does not need air to breathe he does
[1:17:03] not need my help or your help he does
[1:17:05] not need anything he's self-existing
[1:17:10] eternal
[1:17:11] nothing's going to stop him from being
[1:17:13] eternal
[1:17:15] but he decides to start creating a world
[1:17:19] and he decides to start creating people
[1:17:21] to live on that world knowing they would
[1:17:24] fall
[1:17:26] knowing he'd have to come right down
[1:17:28] here
[1:17:29] get in a body of Flesh born a baby give
[1:17:33] his life
[1:17:35] and then get somebody to believe that
[1:17:37] that's pretty unbelievable all right
[1:17:41] amen
[1:17:43] that's why we got the Believers
[1:17:46] that's why we really got to be Believers
[1:17:48] right because this story
[1:17:51] is unbelievable
[1:17:53] how that this God that don't need nobody
[1:17:56] he don't need nothing to exist
[1:17:58] but yeah this is what he saw and this is
[1:18:01] what he wanted amen right that's
[1:18:03] unbelievable in our human brain I mean
[1:18:06] just think just take your own selfish
[1:18:07] self
[1:18:09] and just that you needed nothing sister
[1:18:11] Anna you needed you didn't need nobody
[1:18:13] you can just go creative we're gonna go
[1:18:15] sit there and live for an eternity and
[1:18:16] not even not even grow old
[1:18:19] amen right
[1:18:22] right but have a thought in your mind
[1:18:23] that you want to be a daddy
[1:18:25] you want to have fellowship with
[1:18:27] somebody
[1:18:28] you won't have somebody to talk to you
[1:18:30] you want to have something to to to
[1:18:32] relate to
[1:18:34] and hear this God says okay I'll let all
[1:18:37] this happen
[1:18:40] because the glorification of Jesus in
[1:18:43] this chapter of John
[1:18:45] was in John chapter 17.
[1:18:48] and in John chapter 17 he talks more of
[1:18:51] me and you
[1:18:54] than he does himself
[1:18:57] he should glorify me father with the
[1:18:59] glory that we have what Glory did he
[1:19:01] have before the foundation of the world
[1:19:03] what we're talking about here
[1:19:05] he had us in his mind
[1:19:07] and had to get away to get us out
[1:19:10] so we had to let all this happen we're
[1:19:12] not going to get done now I thought we
[1:19:13] were gonna have time
[1:19:14] all right listen
[1:19:17] but God
[1:19:20] wouldn't dwell in anything unclean so
[1:19:22] the Old Testament nothing could do away
[1:19:24] with sin
[1:19:27] it just pushed it back to Calvary and
[1:19:30] heaped it up on
[1:19:32] to a man that came in human flesh
[1:19:36] now listen
[1:19:39] that Son of God was a spirit God that
[1:19:43] when we talk about Spirit we think of
[1:19:46] uh you know like Casper the Friendly
[1:19:48] Ghost
[1:19:49] really that's what we think of
[1:19:51] but that Son of God was more real than
[1:19:53] anything we ever knew or no or or or
[1:19:56] have any uh comprehension of right all
[1:19:59] right so let's just don't think that God
[1:20:01] evolved from a spirit down to a human
[1:20:03] being I don't I think he was pretty
[1:20:06] human before he started because he said
[1:20:08] let us create man in our image right and
[1:20:11] in our likeness and what we become
[1:20:13] human beings all right
[1:20:15] so here we have a man that will talk
[1:20:19] about doing this but the life
[1:20:23] that was in the blood of those animals
[1:20:29] couldn't clean them up
[1:20:32] but there was one coming
[1:20:35] that could live the life
[1:20:37] show us how to live the life
[1:20:39] and then begin our or bring many sons
[1:20:43] unto himself like I said Melchizedek
[1:20:46] couldn't do any ones in our Kinsmen
[1:20:48] Kinsmen had to be Ruth could not get
[1:20:51] someone that was not kin to her
[1:20:55] right Naomi
[1:20:57] there was no way that that anybody else
[1:21:01] could do it except family
[1:21:05] he wasn't done any good if the mayor of
[1:21:07] the city would have walked out there if
[1:21:08] he was not kin
[1:21:11] to Naomi
[1:21:15] you want another no good he could not
[1:21:18] have restored back to her what Boaz did
[1:21:21] but Boaz could do it because they were
[1:21:24] in line of the family
[1:21:26] they were in the family line
[1:21:28] all right same way with you and I now
[1:21:31] that's not to say that the people in the
[1:21:33] Old Testament was not in the economy of
[1:21:36] God but they were not the family of God
[1:21:42] there's a difference
[1:21:43] they're in the economy of God but not
[1:21:45] the family of God
[1:21:47] the family of God God had one purpose
[1:21:49] and that was for me and you to come
[1:21:51] forth now how to explain that to to not
[1:21:56] trying to belittle the Old Testament I
[1:21:58] guess I don't have words to do that but
[1:22:01] just one thing's for sure those people
[1:22:03] in the Old Testament did not have a
[1:22:06] birth like you and I have
[1:22:09] as far as spiritual birth
[1:22:11] so they couldn't be a Son of God in the
[1:22:14] line of the family right
[1:22:17] family lineage that's right he called
[1:22:21] Abraham a friend of God not
[1:22:24] remember the Bible says he's a friend
[1:22:28] in the economy of God I believe that
[1:22:30] we're going to have some friends with us
[1:22:32] in eternity
[1:22:34] but we're going to live with the family
[1:22:36] amen that city is only going to have
[1:22:39] family right
[1:22:41] that Millennium is going to have family
[1:22:43] and friends maybe the the Jews
[1:22:46] but that future home inside that City
[1:22:48] wall thing but one group of people gonna
[1:22:51] live in that city right and that's
[1:22:52] family members
[1:22:55] now you say Abraham Isaac and Jacob
[1:22:57] whatever that tells you that they're the
[1:22:59] pillows and they're the foundation and
[1:23:00] they're the parts of the wall but they
[1:23:03] didn't say they were part of the city
[1:23:04] right right you and I are the only part
[1:23:07] of that City
[1:23:08] let's go to Hebrews two
[1:23:15] you love the Lord amen amen I do I love
[1:23:18] you more every day
[1:23:24] but can you say like
[1:23:26] the one that said though God slay me and
[1:23:28] I'll trust him right yes
[1:23:31] thank you
[1:23:36] Hebrews 2 verse 6.
[1:23:40] but wanting a certain place testifies
[1:23:42] saying what is man that thou art mindful
[1:23:44] of him or the son of man that thou
[1:23:47] visiteth him thou amazed him a little
[1:23:49] lower than the angels and here we're
[1:23:51] coming down to Jesus Christ I think we
[1:23:53] all understand that this man that was
[1:23:55] born that was born a baby was almighty
[1:23:59] God I hope we don't have to go over that
[1:24:02] part
[1:24:04] the latest him a little lower than the
[1:24:06] angels that crownest him with glory and
[1:24:08] honor and did it over the works of thy
[1:24:11] hand I thou has put all things in
[1:24:14] subjection under his feet so it must
[1:24:17] have been human
[1:24:18] him his feet
[1:24:20] for him that he put all in subjection
[1:24:22] under him he left nothing
[1:24:26] that is not put under him
[1:24:28] right who are we talking about son of
[1:24:29] man but now we see not yet all things
[1:24:33] put under him
[1:24:34] what because all of them will still have
[1:24:37] we were still having
[1:24:40] but we see Jesus it was made a little
[1:24:42] lower than the angels for the suffering
[1:24:44] of death crowned with Glory and Honor
[1:24:46] that he made by the grace of God
[1:24:49] should taste deaf for every man
[1:24:52] for it became him for whom are all
[1:24:56] things and by whom are all things in
[1:24:59] bringing many sons unto glory to make
[1:25:03] the captain of their salvation perfect
[1:25:06] through suffering for both he that
[1:25:09] sanctifies and they who are Sanctified
[1:25:11] are all of one for which cause he is not
[1:25:16] ashamed to call them Brethren amen right
[1:25:22] join Ayers Roman said we're heirs and
[1:25:26] join heirs whatever he has joint means
[1:25:30] thank you the same
[1:25:35] now
[1:25:37] here we've got the son of man walking on
[1:25:40] the face of the Earth and what's in this
[1:25:42] son of man the Son of God right
[1:25:45] Spirit man has taken on human flesh
[1:25:48] right and now
[1:25:51] now Jehovah God is known up in the cloud
[1:25:54] somewhere
[1:25:56] waiting on somebody to bring him a
[1:25:58] sacrifice
[1:25:59] of an animal
[1:26:02] to try to push the sand back but not do
[1:26:04] away with it here's a man that comes on
[1:26:06] the earth that can do what he said he
[1:26:09] was going to do in Genesis 3.
[1:26:11] he come through the womb of a woman
[1:26:14] he come to do what bruised the Serpent's
[1:26:17] head all right he come through the womb
[1:26:19] the son of man
[1:26:22] but what did the son of man do
[1:26:24] the son of man yielded to the one that
[1:26:26] was inside of it that's right okay
[1:26:29] that's important
[1:26:32] because the son of man was not listen to
[1:26:35] this son of man was not the controlling
[1:26:37] Factor
[1:26:39] the Son of God was the controlling
[1:26:41] Factor
[1:26:43] anybody got that
[1:26:45] Son of God was one that did the
[1:26:47] controlling
[1:26:50] I'm making some sense
[1:26:52] because you know what we gotta do the
[1:26:54] same thing all right
[1:26:57] now
[1:26:58] just a few minutes
[1:27:02] the outside man you were looking at the
[1:27:04] son of man was the sacrifice
[1:27:07] the Son of God is the one that went down
[1:27:09] and paid the price right
[1:27:11] he said he gave the stolen Ransom in
[1:27:13] Isaiah 53 so that he could see what
[1:27:17] his seed
[1:27:19] which is who
[1:27:20] who is my seed Josh and Hannah because
[1:27:23] they what they came from me
[1:27:25] so for in other words for God to see his
[1:27:28] children
[1:27:30] brother Howard he had to go to hell for
[1:27:32] us amen he had to take this thing of
[1:27:34] death he had to take every sin we'd ever
[1:27:36] permit
[1:27:38] every sin we'd ever commit
[1:27:42] are going to commit
[1:27:45] and he took him to hell and when he
[1:27:47] kicked Satan into that pit and took the
[1:27:50] keys
[1:27:51] he kicked minding your sins and they're
[1:27:53] with him
[1:27:55] came back out
[1:27:57] and he didn't go back up in a fog he
[1:28:00] came back up and picked that body back
[1:28:02] up
[1:28:03] oh Lord he picked that sacrifice back up
[1:28:06] because now it was worthy right
[1:28:08] right that body
[1:28:11] thou has prepared me like we preached a
[1:28:14] little while ago
[1:28:16] you and I have got to see that being an
[1:28:19] offspring of God
[1:28:23] so your Mom and Daddy brought this thing
[1:28:25] you're looking at
[1:28:27] God took possession of it when he gave
[1:28:30] you the new birth
[1:28:32] he took possession of his sister to your
[1:28:34] mama and daddy natural if you're born
[1:28:36] again today your natural mom and dad
[1:28:39] didn't have anything to do with your
[1:28:41] being here all right hang on yeah I know
[1:28:44] they did look at I mean you see you see
[1:28:46] me
[1:28:47] but you understand when we give
[1:28:49] ourselves over when when a wife gives
[1:28:51] herself over to a man she don't just
[1:28:53] give him her hand right
[1:28:55] hello somebody you don't just get that
[1:28:58] one out now now you can you can touch my
[1:29:00] hair now husband you can touch my hair
[1:29:02] but leave the rest of me alone yeah I
[1:29:04] know
[1:29:06] I thought we gave our whole self right
[1:29:09] over to our husband
[1:29:12] so that he could what be the controlling
[1:29:14] Factor
[1:29:16] and that's our problem people
[1:29:18] we haven't give ourselves over you might
[1:29:22] be married
[1:29:23] that's right but you have not give
[1:29:25] yourself completely over and let Christ
[1:29:27] be your head
[1:29:30] because of whatever we can preach on
[1:29:32] that for another hour
[1:29:34] but they listen to the point I'm trying
[1:29:37] to make
[1:29:40] when God began
[1:29:43] he knew it would take blood
[1:29:46] so he let that substitutionary blood be
[1:29:49] the negative part
[1:29:52] where that we would learn right we would
[1:29:54] know that that's what God started he did
[1:29:57] not want that to begin with
[1:29:59] but until he got here
[1:30:01] to release that life he had to be a
[1:30:05] Kinsman first
[1:30:06] he had to come in human flesh to even
[1:30:09] get to us that's right that's right just
[1:30:12] to get to us he had to come into human
[1:30:14] flesh that's what I said Melchizedek
[1:30:16] couldn't do it for us people that's all
[1:30:18] right come on the one inside of
[1:30:20] Melchizedek did but Melchizedek himself
[1:30:23] could not be our savior
[1:30:26] though we did what though he showed the
[1:30:29] signs of Messiah
[1:30:32] he could not die for Abraham or any of
[1:30:36] us amen God had to come through the womb
[1:30:41] be the son of man with the Son of God
[1:30:45] inside of that son of man not being two
[1:30:48] separate people right good grief
[1:30:53] we have trouble
[1:30:56] I believe Jesus would have had a lot of
[1:30:58] trouble if he would have been warring
[1:31:00] this way and God this way he wouldn't
[1:31:03] have been almighty God
[1:31:06] because I believe he said somewhere he
[1:31:07] said I only do that which the father
[1:31:09] shows me now he said I only
[1:31:12] now I don't think
[1:31:14] like Dave was saying this morning so I
[1:31:15] was thinking this morning about some
[1:31:17] human things now the human things of
[1:31:19] Jesus I don't think that he you know God
[1:31:22] said eat
[1:31:23] you know
[1:31:25] the warning signs eight no he was a
[1:31:27] human being when he got hungry
[1:31:30] God put that in motion before you know
[1:31:32] when he put man in human flesh
[1:31:36] so when he said only do that the father
[1:31:37] shows me he's not like this
[1:31:39] turn left
[1:31:41] no he just walked about his daily duties
[1:31:45] but he was subject to the one that was
[1:31:48] inside of him and don't tell me that the
[1:31:51] devil didn't talk to him daily hourly
[1:31:54] weekly monthly and every minute that he
[1:31:57] could
[1:31:59] yeah
[1:32:01] and don't think we're gonna be any
[1:32:02] different
[1:32:04] that's what I'm trying to say is this
[1:32:06] great Son of God that that couldn't he
[1:32:10] couldn't give the people in the Old
[1:32:12] Testament the new birth because he
[1:32:14] hadn't come to release that life yet but
[1:32:17] now that he has
[1:32:19] read the New Testament the New Testament
[1:32:22] speaks of me and you it shows a shadow
[1:32:25] of what they did in the Old Testament
[1:32:27] but the death of the testator brought a
[1:32:30] new life or a new creation like in
[1:32:33] Genesis 3 I mean revelation 3.
[1:32:37] that's preached on it many times Brother
[1:32:39] Rich you know this is the beginning he
[1:32:42] was the beginning of the real creation
[1:32:44] of God not the physical creation
[1:32:48] physical creation was finished when we
[1:32:50] read it in Genesis one right all those
[1:32:52] things were set into motion
[1:32:55] but he wanted a manner why
[1:32:58] why would God put that in Revelations 3
[1:33:02] that in this end time that's what he
[1:33:04] wanted if he would have wanted it that
[1:33:07] way in the Old Testament he'd put it
[1:33:08] back in Genesis he said oh this is the
[1:33:10] beginning of the creation of God he
[1:33:12] didn't put that in there because that
[1:33:14] wasn't what God all wanted all it's not
[1:33:16] that
[1:33:17] I think what sometimes when you tell
[1:33:19] people that there was no sons of our
[1:33:22] daughters of God in the Old Testament
[1:33:23] that's belittling somebody that's not
[1:33:25] belittling they're the Warriors of Faith
[1:33:28] Hebrews 11 proves that the world was not
[1:33:31] even worthy for them to be him
[1:33:34] but they don't have the position that
[1:33:36] you and I have
[1:33:38] they're not Sons and Daughters of God by
[1:33:40] birth they would do things wrong and and
[1:33:43] and David would go out and and my gosh
[1:33:46] have his best friend killed
[1:33:49] yeah
[1:33:51] commit adultery
[1:33:54] and then
[1:33:56] repent
[1:33:58] and God and then make a sacrifice and
[1:34:01] God said I'll accept that
[1:34:03] because he knew if David had the new
[1:34:06] birth he wouldn't have done what he did
[1:34:09] but in the economy of God the Old
[1:34:11] Testament had to build a platform for
[1:34:14] that man called Jesus to step out on
[1:34:17] all those Old Testament prophets of
[1:34:20] Peace here a piece there I read it
[1:34:22] Elijah was part of God
[1:34:24] part of Christ portrayed
[1:34:28] portrayed portray
[1:34:30] you and I don't if we like I said before
[1:34:32] this is where I'm ending up to if we
[1:34:34] come to the part of where we act like
[1:34:36] the people in the Old Testament then we
[1:34:38] know we're not born again as far as the
[1:34:39] things that they did wrong
[1:34:41] all right and if we come up to a place
[1:34:44] to where we can't come to a place of
[1:34:47] repentance then the blood of Jesus
[1:34:49] Christ what the Bible say
[1:34:51] the Bloods were not a fact
[1:34:54] it's no it's not a fact you come to a
[1:34:56] place where there's not even sacrifice
[1:34:57] for the things that you do okay what a
[1:35:00] terrible place
[1:35:01] but this substitute blood
[1:35:05] come over to a man that could do what he
[1:35:09] said he was going to do he said destroy
[1:35:11] this Temple and I'll raise it up three
[1:35:12] days
[1:35:14] I'll come back and not just be with you
[1:35:16] I'm going to be in you right amen I in
[1:35:19] you and you and me
[1:35:21] what a family
[1:35:25] and like brother Brown said he made a
[1:35:27] quote the other day and I started to
[1:35:28] bring it and I forgot it
[1:35:29] but he said Satan you know he's just a
[1:35:31] bluff
[1:35:32] right see he's bluffed them in the Old
[1:35:34] Testament see Bluff in the New
[1:35:36] Testaments he's bluffing us now he said
[1:35:38] but God has now give us the stuff
[1:35:45] no he said the stuff to take care of the
[1:35:47] bluff that's what the quote is he said
[1:35:49] he give look it up in your computer he
[1:35:51] gave us the stuff
[1:35:52] to take care of the bluff and that's
[1:35:54] what he's given us in the end time the
[1:35:56] stuff to take care of the Bluffs let's
[1:35:59] read this right here and then God come
[1:36:00] back
[1:36:01] in the
[1:36:02] independent let's turn first John two
[1:36:05] I'll read you a few quotes here
[1:36:08] thank you
[1:36:09] you come back on the day of Pentecost is
[1:36:11] what start having children
[1:36:13] because he couldn't have children in the
[1:36:15] Old Testament because the womb of Eve
[1:36:18] had been what closed up right so no Sons
[1:36:21] and Daughters of God could be born in
[1:36:22] the Old Testament like God wanted it
[1:36:25] right
[1:36:26] because the woman was polluted but when
[1:36:29] he came through the womb
[1:36:30] now he just it just it didn't clean
[1:36:32] Mary's natural wound let's get that
[1:36:35] straight it didn't clean her natural
[1:36:38] womb she had to go to Pentecost and have
[1:36:41] her spiritual wound clean amen that's
[1:36:43] right we ain't talking about the ones of
[1:36:45] a man anymore we're talking about the
[1:36:47] spoken word of God
[1:36:50] because he promised that that's why I
[1:36:52] said in Genesis 3 if you'll pick that
[1:36:54] scripture apart
[1:36:55] I see of a woman a woman don't have a
[1:36:57] seat
[1:36:58] so how did it have to come and she
[1:36:59] didn't know a man
[1:37:02] I'd have had it come creation spoken
[1:37:05] word
[1:37:07] had to come through the spoken word
[1:37:08] listen lamb singing Church age
[1:37:11] no I'm sorry let's read power
[1:37:13] transformation
[1:37:14] 1965 1031.
[1:37:18] Talk About Eve and corrupting that seed
[1:37:20] with a corruptable seed before it could
[1:37:22] get there to corrupt that beautiful
[1:37:23] Garden of Eden
[1:37:25] or only thing that he is is just
[1:37:27] restoration where we are now we're on
[1:37:30] our road back to that original beginning
[1:37:32] of the creation of God back to the
[1:37:34] Garden of Eden again husband and wife
[1:37:37] without any sin or anything to live
[1:37:39] Eternal live a sin Church age you
[1:37:42] talking about he's standing in the midst
[1:37:43] of the church and he's standing there
[1:37:44] revealing who is he in this last stage
[1:37:46] he calls himself the author of the
[1:37:48] creation of God this is another creation
[1:37:50] this has to do with the church this is a
[1:37:53] special designation of himself he is the
[1:37:56] creator of that church now let's go down
[1:37:58] and save time there you can see that
[1:38:00] though man was of the old order of
[1:38:02] creation Now in Union with Christ he has
[1:38:05] become the new creation of God Ephesians
[1:38:07] 2 and 10.
[1:38:09] is another creation distinct from the
[1:38:12] old one no longer is he dealing by ways
[1:38:14] of the flesh see that's what he done by
[1:38:17] the ways of the flesh he fell
[1:38:20] now God had to come back through flesh
[1:38:23] but through flesh
[1:38:26] through the fleshly tables of our
[1:38:29] heart
[1:38:32] he's bringing Sons and Daughters back to
[1:38:33] himself not to the loins of a man
[1:38:35] anymore not through natural sectac not
[1:38:38] through any of that it's on spoken word
[1:38:40] spoken word seed of God all right that
[1:38:43] makes that's why we all be virgins right
[1:38:45] okay virgins to God
[1:38:48] it's another creation distinct from the
[1:38:50] old one no longer is he dealing by ways
[1:38:52] of the flesh that's how he dealt with
[1:38:55] Israel Old Testament
[1:38:58] he chose Abraham and of Abraham's issue
[1:39:01] through the god of the Isaac line but
[1:39:03] now out of every Kindred driving Nation
[1:39:05] he has purposed a new creation he is the
[1:39:09] first of that creation he was God
[1:39:11] created in the form of man Now by his
[1:39:14] Spirit he is creating many sons unto
[1:39:17] himself God the Creator creating himself
[1:39:20] a part of his creation this is the true
[1:39:24] revelation of God glory now I say to any
[1:39:28] of those
[1:39:29] uh people are on the internet that that
[1:39:32] can't understand why the
[1:39:35] um there was no sons of God like they
[1:39:36] are now in the old in the New Testament
[1:39:38] in the Old Testament
[1:39:40] let me read that again this is the true
[1:39:42] revelation of God
[1:39:45] the true revelation of God is and he
[1:39:47] wanted sons and daughters
[1:39:49] just like he wanted him in the New
[1:39:50] Testament
[1:39:52] they weren't in the old
[1:39:53] sorry I'm sorry they were not
[1:39:56] couldn't be the testator hadn't died yet
[1:40:00] read John when first John 2
[1:40:03] right there run at Hebrew
[1:40:07] the book of Hebrews is a real powerful
[1:40:09] um
[1:40:12] chapter of scripture but I like the
[1:40:14] little Johns
[1:40:16] because he talks about us
[1:40:19] well he already saw us in the in the
[1:40:22] church ages so he knew what we were
[1:40:23] going to do he had the end of the book
[1:40:30] two verse 22.
[1:40:35] who is a liar but he that denies that
[1:40:37] Jesus is the Christ
[1:40:39] and he is Antichrist that denies the
[1:40:42] father and the son
[1:40:43] whosoever denies the son the same hath
[1:40:46] not the father but he that acknowledged
[1:40:49] the son had the father also go to 3-1
[1:40:52] behold what manner of love the father
[1:40:55] has bestowed upon
[1:40:58] us
[1:41:01] that we should be called
[1:41:03] the sons of God
[1:41:06] therefore the world knoweth us not
[1:41:08] because it knew him not what the sign
[1:41:11] still don't know they think it's three
[1:41:14] separate people
[1:41:17] but if you know the father you know who
[1:41:19] the son is
[1:41:21] you and I we shouldn't know if we talk
[1:41:23] about the father we should know who the
[1:41:25] son is
[1:41:27] not as a separate Identity or a separate
[1:41:29] person
[1:41:30] beloved now
[1:41:34] are we the sons of God
[1:41:37] and it does not yet appear what we shall
[1:41:39] be but we know that when we shall appear
[1:41:42] when he shall appear we shall be like
[1:41:44] him for we shall see him as he is and
[1:41:48] every man that hath this hope in him
[1:41:49] purifies himself even as he
[1:41:53] is pure now let's go to John
[1:41:56] seven
[1:41:58] not first John John 7.
[1:42:11] verse 37.
[1:42:15] in the last days that great day of the
[1:42:17] feast Jesus stood and cried out saying
[1:42:18] if any man thirst let him come unto me
[1:42:20] and drink and he didn't believeth on me
[1:42:22] as the scripture has said out of his
[1:42:24] belly shall flow rivers of Living Water
[1:42:26] but this fake he of the spirit in other
[1:42:29] words what the commentator John is
[1:42:31] telling you that's not going to happen
[1:42:32] right then
[1:42:34] it's not gonna happen right then exactly
[1:42:36] but it's going to happen when when this
[1:42:39] Holy Ghost has come right but this
[1:42:42] because remember see it's in parentheses
[1:42:43] what's John doing
[1:42:45] he's like uh dad said he's interpolating
[1:42:48] what Jesus was saying it wasn't the
[1:42:50] spirit wasn't going to come right then
[1:42:51] but it was going to come after the day
[1:42:53] of Pentecost but this Faith Hill of the
[1:42:55] spirit which they that believe on him
[1:42:57] should receive for the Holy Ghost was
[1:43:00] not yet given
[1:43:03] because that Jesus was not yet glorified
[1:43:06] right and we don't have time to read it
[1:43:08] but this was something I wrote down
[1:43:10] Jesus's glorification was to bring four
[1:43:12] Sons
[1:43:13] and daughters of God
[1:43:19] not something like him
[1:43:24] like him
[1:43:26] Bill to be like God is to be the devil
[1:43:29] oh think about that right
[1:43:33] that's what he's saying
[1:43:35] yeah so the Old Testament prophets
[1:43:38] couldn't even come close
[1:43:41] but yet they are foundations of what we
[1:43:43] walk on we don't do away with the old
[1:43:46] testimony I was not doing away with the
[1:43:48] Old Testament but I was showing that how
[1:43:51] that
[1:43:52] listen to this let me read this godhead
[1:43:55] explained in 1961.
[1:43:58] now there that blood cell was broke now
[1:44:00] when they we lay our hands by faith on
[1:44:02] the trembling Lamb of God fill his flesh
[1:44:04] clearing and shaking for us our hands
[1:44:06] become bathed with his blood and our
[1:44:07] souls the life that was in him wasn't
[1:44:10] just a mere man
[1:44:11] neither wasn't an animal it was God so
[1:44:15] that life comes back upon the Sanctified
[1:44:17] one and becomes the son or daughter of
[1:44:20] God and offspring of God see the life of
[1:44:23] God and we are Sons and Daughters of God
[1:44:25] through the breaking of that blood cell
[1:44:27] Jesus Christ now what is it then God is
[1:44:30] back in his people fellowshipping like
[1:44:32] he did in the Garden of Eden right there
[1:44:36] you are Sons and Daughters isn't it
[1:44:38] beautiful right
[1:44:41] that's what he wanted I think we have
[1:44:43] this problem that we think we can't get
[1:44:46] back
[1:44:48] well we can't
[1:44:50] but if we got the one it can inside of
[1:44:52] us amen that's what I said no problem
[1:44:57] when God
[1:44:58] redeems your soul sister
[1:45:01] he got your body too he took possession
[1:45:04] amen right right he took possession of
[1:45:07] his Earth he sure as well gonna take
[1:45:09] possession of your Earth
[1:45:11] and their sons and daughters of God not
[1:45:14] like God
[1:45:16] but God
[1:45:18] in another form called a bride
[1:45:22] the filing morphe the last thing you're
[1:45:24] ever going to see of God glory
[1:45:27] let me read you one more I put it up and
[1:45:29] I'm going to read one morning we'll be
[1:45:30] finished
[1:45:39] all right be Not Afraid 1961 listen to
[1:45:42] this
[1:45:43] that spirit that comes out of there
[1:45:45] comes into the human spirit and makes
[1:45:47] him a son and daughter of God Amen
[1:45:49] that's the new birth that's the gospel
[1:45:52] if I know anything about it the cell
[1:45:55] that was in there God created himself
[1:45:57] with his own self he come down a little
[1:46:00] baby Jehovah and was born unstable over
[1:46:02] a manure and it ought to be striking to
[1:46:04] the people of Jehovah lying in the
[1:46:05] stable and we think we're somebody
[1:46:07] Jehovah planning his child listen
[1:46:12] Jehovah then raised up he proved he was
[1:46:14] Jehovah sure he was yes sir
[1:46:17] John knew him about who he was
[1:46:19] it's God working his way back into man
[1:46:26] and that's when he started with in the
[1:46:29] Old Testament let's stand
[1:46:30] he started in the Old Testament
[1:46:32] Testament beginning to work his way back
[1:46:35] right but he couldn't get back because
[1:46:39] the wound was polluted and there was no
[1:46:41] way to make that womb
[1:46:44] clean again
[1:46:47] other than coming back into it right
[1:46:51] then when he come back into it then when
[1:46:53] that man came the the blood cell broke
[1:46:57] the life that was in that blood could
[1:47:00] come back in The Believer
[1:47:03] the animal I've couldn't didn't have
[1:47:05] soul right
[1:47:08] then that life could come back into me
[1:47:10] and you
[1:47:13] and if they took my blood
[1:47:16] and did a DNA check
[1:47:18] they'd find out Josh was my son if I did
[1:47:20] a blood test on him
[1:47:23] same thing with God Amen because when we
[1:47:27] accept that blood like brother Brown
[1:47:28] said he said you could have the blood
[1:47:30] and you hang it he said but it's the
[1:47:32] acceptance of the life that was in that
[1:47:35] blood
[1:47:36] not the chemistry not the not the oh
[1:47:39] it'd be great to have it but Adolf
[1:47:41] Hitler could have held it in his hand
[1:47:42] and been just the worst sinner in the
[1:47:44] world
[1:47:45] he probably would have made it worse
[1:47:46] trying to sell it make millions of
[1:47:48] dollars off of it
[1:47:49] but you and I would cherish you but
[1:47:51] still that didn't do any good
[1:47:53] until we accepted the life that was in
[1:47:55] that blood that he could come back and
[1:47:58] clean me and you up there we come back
[1:48:00] to that believing part
[1:48:02] you must believe in something you've
[1:48:04] never seen that's right
[1:48:07] something that's so eternal
[1:48:11] and so pure and so holy but you've never
[1:48:13] seen it before
[1:48:15] you never seen that literal blood you've
[1:48:16] never seen that literal life the only
[1:48:18] way you see that life is through when I
[1:48:20] told you when you shook each other's
[1:48:21] hand that's what you see the lights now
[1:48:23] and that's why God said he said the
[1:48:26] world will not see me anymore
[1:48:28] that's why because I'm gonna hide myself
[1:48:31] in my children amen and all down through
[1:48:34] the church ages that's what he did he
[1:48:36] hid himself inside of a group of people
[1:48:39] just a hodgepodge group of people that
[1:48:42] the world the Bible says wasn't even
[1:48:43] worthy with the Old Testament ones and
[1:48:46] hey they did the same thing to the New
[1:48:47] Testament ones in the in the Dark Ages
[1:48:50] they tied them up they pulled them apart
[1:48:51] they cut their guts out they let the
[1:48:54] babies be eaten by Hogs same thing
[1:48:56] happened in the Old Testament happened
[1:48:58] more in the New Testament because the
[1:49:01] devil knew then he was fighting a God
[1:49:04] that was in a group of people like
[1:49:06] brother Harris always said he said if
[1:49:08] God if Satan would have left Jesus alone
[1:49:10] he'd only had to fought one right now
[1:49:12] when he came back in a group of people
[1:49:14] the first day with 120. then that
[1:49:17] afternoon it was 3 000 little Jesus
[1:49:19] isn't it's been growing ever since
[1:49:21] God has God has hid himself the way he
[1:49:24] wanted to be right and that's inside of
[1:49:27] me and you and people don't know what to
[1:49:29] do about it because he sees the plan he
[1:49:33] knows the plan
[1:49:34] but he tries to pervert the plan right
[1:49:37] and to pervert the plan see he tries to
[1:49:40] get us off on this doctor and get us off
[1:49:42] on this tries to get this to happen even
[1:49:44] drop that and lay it over here because
[1:49:47] see that's not full restoration right
[1:49:49] this is for restoration putting right
[1:49:51] back where it started what brother
[1:49:52] Branham did during the dark during all
[1:49:54] the ages see man could get us maybe to
[1:49:56] him
[1:49:57] yeah
[1:49:58] Loose Ends right things we couldn't see
[1:50:01] policy we don't see all things but when
[1:50:03] brother Brown came to bring a truth back
[1:50:06] he showed us that it's right there is
[1:50:08] where he goes right that was the Loose
[1:50:10] Ends that kept people dying this keeps
[1:50:12] people from dying when you come back to
[1:50:14] the same because Adam wasn't dying
[1:50:16] before the fall Adam was not dying right
[1:50:19] he was not dying before the fall this
[1:50:21] world was not dying before the fall this
[1:50:24] world was perfect let's take a song
[1:50:31] the Avenue
[1:50:34] 272 in the spiral book
[1:50:37] by the woman that passed away
[1:50:42] I were singing
[1:50:47] towards things that could not satisfy
[1:50:56] thank you
[1:51:00] and I heard my
[1:51:20] concern the Lord
[1:51:56] there are millions in this world
[1:52:09] all kind of things to do except the
[1:52:12] desire that God give them
[1:52:16] a
[1:52:24] God
[1:52:38] I lift it up
[1:52:46] this Thursday
[1:53:19] that's what's happened right there
[1:53:22] this world don't leave a hunger but God
[1:53:25] will leave one
[1:53:38] amen if you need
[1:53:42] to
[1:53:42] hear me
[1:53:52] I lived here
[1:54:12] I want
[1:54:16] here's my God
[1:54:20] make me home
[1:54:25] amen I like that song fill my cup
[1:54:29] and even if you feel my cup Lord my
[1:54:32] saucer and my plate right my table and
[1:54:35] make a mess
[1:54:37] this is a man
[1:54:46] of the man I love you
[1:54:51] before
[1:55:02] camera
[1:55:04] favorite
[1:55:06] you're a comfort
[1:55:15] able
[1:55:20] here's what he does
[1:55:22] he leaves me and he guides me
[1:55:28] laying inside me Holy Spirit
[1:55:33] you're a comfort to me
[1:55:38] you know you wonder brother I heard him
[1:55:40] the other day talking about how that
[1:55:43] Fanny Crosby and some of those ones that
[1:55:45] the great composers that God would come
[1:55:47] on him with an anointing and when they
[1:55:49] come off of him like uh one of them that
[1:55:51] committed suicide and one they always
[1:55:54] they couldn't handle it well you'd think
[1:55:56] that the old testament's probably the
[1:55:58] same way
[1:55:59] uh look at um Jonah
[1:56:02] Jonah went and converted a city of 200
[1:56:07] 000 people even to where they put ashes
[1:56:10] on their animals they wanted even their
[1:56:12] animals to be saved
[1:56:13] but brother Brown said when that
[1:56:15] anointing left him said he went up on
[1:56:17] the hill sat down and cried forgot to
[1:56:19] kill him right that's right why
[1:56:22] he could feel that anointing that's
[1:56:23] right and then when that thing left
[1:56:27] there was nothing to stay inside of him
[1:56:29] it's just a girl there was nothing there
[1:56:31] was no just like what we were singing
[1:56:32] about the Holy Spirit in your comfort to
[1:56:34] me when it left them it was just the
[1:56:36] same old person that was there there was
[1:56:38] nothing to clean them up but now you and
[1:56:41] I we can enjoy that anointing that comes
[1:56:43] down on on us when we're driving or or
[1:56:47] praying or
[1:56:50] are singing in the car and then when
[1:56:53] that leaves guess what he said I'll
[1:56:55] never leave you that's right not forsake
[1:56:57] it so he didn't go far and he still
[1:57:01] right
[1:57:02] that's one thing he can't do he can't
[1:57:04] take this out of you once he puts it in
[1:57:06] you and he takes that whole vessel
[1:57:10] that's where people's missed it even in
[1:57:13] this man this mess they're missing it
[1:57:14] when God redeems that Soul he redeemed
[1:57:18] that whole entire vessel Glory he didn't
[1:57:21] just redeem a little back of the Earth
[1:57:24] right he said it would be a redeemed
[1:57:27] entire Earth that that future home is
[1:57:29] going to set on right well who's going
[1:57:31] to sit in that future home we are
[1:57:37] that's my giant Soul the city coming
[1:57:40] down and he said it looked like a bride
[1:57:42] adorned for a husband why was it because
[1:57:45] it was the bride right
[1:57:47] when the city of Lula has a um has a
[1:57:51] festival and has a parade the paper says
[1:57:55] the whole city of Louisville come out
[1:57:57] right well that don't mean all the
[1:57:58] buildings come out and got next to the
[1:58:00] road
[1:58:01] what it happened the people right came
[1:58:04] out of the building and went down the
[1:58:06] road and never sent the whole city came
[1:58:08] out to see it so who's what's the city
[1:58:11] cities the people that's what God wanted
[1:58:14] man he wanted the Garden of Eden to be
[1:58:18] the future home
[1:58:20] but what happened in the garden showed
[1:58:23] more of his love than for that just to
[1:58:26] happen so he let all this happen to show
[1:58:29] his salvation his healing and and all
[1:58:32] the great things we thank you much more
[1:58:33] now than we would if we were just made a
[1:58:36] bunch of cookie cutter people just you
[1:58:37] know that's right stamp you know this
[1:58:39] one everybody was the same you know
[1:58:42] that's not what God wanted guys have got

[1:59:03] that will never leave you bro right he's
[1:59:05] not going to leave you he's gonna take
[1:59:07] that little man right into eternity and
[1:59:09] that little man is going to look just
[1:59:10] like that right there he thought so much
[1:59:12] of that man he made it just like
[1:59:14] everybody amen remember brother Robin
[1:59:16] said he took this one and this one right
[1:59:19] this one to this one this one to this
[1:59:21] one so he could bring that character
[1:59:24] character called Ray Gabriel that
[1:59:27] character right there that's the
[1:59:28] character that God wanted to see amen
[1:59:30] God wanted to see the character in each
[1:59:33] one of us but listen people if you don't
[1:59:36] got God inside of you you act like the
[1:59:39] character of God all you wanted
[1:59:41] but if you got the one inside
[1:59:44] he loves you making all right but he's
[1:59:46] not gonna mold you into something short
[1:59:48] if you're tall or something you know
[1:59:50] blonde headed if you're black-headed no
[1:59:52] he likes that he likes that form just
[1:59:54] like it is what's he doing he's just
[1:59:56] cleaning it off all right this is the
[1:59:58] polishing time people it's been rough
[2:00:00] down Through the Ages this is the time
[2:00:02] God's taking that little bitty sandpaper
[2:00:04] he just he's rubbing the rough edges off
[2:00:07] and getting us in shape to get out of
[2:00:10] here
[2:00:11] you're not the Lord and uh
[2:00:14] just give thanks
[2:00:24] for us
[2:00:30] dear heavenly father we pray Lord that
[2:00:32] you just take us
[2:00:34] through this next week coming up Lord
[2:00:36] anything that comes our way Lord we know
[2:00:38] that you've already supplied
[2:00:40] the things that we need the the armor
[2:00:43] you you've never lost a battle
[2:00:46] Lord what a great I know that Patton and
[2:00:50] some of the ones in the in on the earth
[2:00:52] were great warriors but there was
[2:00:55] battles that they lost
[2:00:57] but Lord we're in an army that has a
[2:01:00] commander that's never been defeated he
[2:01:03] knows all the tactics of the enemy
[2:01:05] before the enemy begins to move
[2:01:07] and Lord I pray that each one of us will
[2:01:09] take those
[2:01:10] things that you give us Lord the the
[2:01:14] greatest playbook in the world the Bible
[2:01:17] that we can see the
[2:01:19] play acting out is it
[2:01:21] actually before it even happens
[2:01:24] but Lord it takes a belief
[2:01:26] it takes us to believe Who We Are
[2:01:29] and believe that you wrote this Bible
[2:01:31] for us Lord is a map is a road map and
[2:01:35] as a love letter
[2:01:37] to your bride
[2:01:38] and there in the end time lord we're
[2:01:40] coming down to the end of the race
[2:01:42] there's no other race to be run Lord
[2:01:45] we'll lay down our Bibles one day and
[2:01:48] put to sort up and go home to Glory
[2:01:50] that's not another there's not another
[2:01:52] group to come up not another platoon
[2:01:54] Lord this is the last battle this is the
[2:01:57] last fight this is the last victory Lord
[2:02:00] is you living in a group of human beings
[2:02:02] just like you wanted to in the Garden of
[2:02:04] Eden father be with each one forgive us
[2:02:07] of our sins be with each one on their
[2:02:09] Highway way home
[2:02:10] that you'll Grant Lord peace to each one
[2:02:13] that In the Still of the Night it's the
[2:02:15] storm rages father that you'll come down
[2:02:18] and and take the fair away father
[2:02:20] because fear is just something that
[2:02:23] Satan uses to to try to get us nervous
[2:02:26] and all upset Lord but like we said
[2:02:28] before and let's just remember that
[2:02:30] you've never lost a battle you've never
[2:02:33] lost a son and daughter of God we may
[2:02:35] have sons and daughters that go out in
[2:02:36] the world do things and we seem like we
[2:02:38] lose them but father you never lost a
[2:02:40] son or daughter of God
[2:02:42] because where you're all for Offspring
[2:02:44] father and we we have your genetics we
[2:02:46] have your makeup and we pray in our
[2:02:48] father that you'll go with us take care
[2:02:50] of us lead us in guide us by your Holy
[2:02:52] Spirit till we come back Wednesday night
