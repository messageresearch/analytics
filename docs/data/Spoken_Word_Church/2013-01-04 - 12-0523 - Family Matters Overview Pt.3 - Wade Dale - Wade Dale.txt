power of your spirit that you'll come down and and use those words Lord to speak what you want the people to have yes that is our desire and our heart Lord is for you to to do the speaking and if it comes out Lord the way you want it then it'll not return void it'll accomplish what he said Lord we live our natural life down here on Earth and you've give us some of the greatest gifts you gave us your soul the eternal life that we have you you gave that Soul the ransom so you could see your seed which is standing today Lord on the earth the worst hour that's ever been since the dawn of time but Lord you promised you'd be with us yes we wouldn't be lost we wouldn't be running around like sheep without a Shepherd but father we'd have a shepherd and you are the Good Shepherd Lord you give

that that we are we're reflecting you father and that's what I want us to see in this whole thing is is when we get down to the end tonight Lord I want to see the the spiritual aspect of this coming to pass where Lord you are our headship yes Lord you're the one that that that's the leader you're the one that took the initiative and come down here in in mortal flesh and gave your life so that so that all your sons and daughters could have eternal life father we pray that you just bless now and be with us as we speak your words father take care of us lead us and guide us we pray Lord that

this day and that doesn't mean a 24-hour day Lord you know as many times I've said Lord bless this day give this day our daily bread well this is the day of the Lord not just one 24-hour period but father this is your day and you brought us into your day to live and we pray now that you just touch each one father for be any sick among us that you'd heal us Lord Deliver us from our destruction as the word Goes Forth father I pray that you'd bless us now and take care of us in Jesus name amen amen 1 Peter 3 verse 1 through 7 likewise you wives be in subjection to your own husbands that if any obey not the word they also May without the word be one by the conversation of the wives amen while they behold their chaste conversation coupled with fear whose adorning let it not be that outward adorning of platting the haon of wearing of gold or putting on of apparel but let it be the hidden man of the heart and that which is not corruptible even the ornament of a Meek and quiet Spirit which is in the sight of God of great price God thinks a lot of our spirit right our meek and quiet spirit for after this manner in the old time the holy women also who trusted in God adorned themselves being in subjection unto their own husband even as Sarah obeyed Abraham calling him Lord whose daughters you are as long as you do well and are not afraid with any amazement likewise ye husbands dwell with them according to knowledge and that's what we're going to talk about tonight dwell with them according to knowledge giving honor unto the wife as unto the weaker Bessel and as being HS together of the grace of life that your prayers be not hindered you may be seated and the Lord add his Blessing to the to the of his word and the last Sunday we kind of got on to the marriage part and and this is going to be more of a review but we wanted to kind of do it and now it's going to be a it'll be a three part instead of a 12p part and we kind of skipped over the role of the male and the role of the female and went to the U to the role of the male and the female while they were having children and how to raise up their children and I hope you enjoyed that this weekend cu I really enjoyed it to it it showed more about how God's going to train you and I how God's going to bring you and I up and how that if he spares a rod he SPS this child right the rod of Correction the rod of correction from here right all right the rod of correction from the word of God it's just bad that you and I have to live in these sinful bodies and and we have to be reminded that we're wrong born in sin shaping their iniquity spouse from our mother's womb a liar so we get whipped for telling lies all right so God whipped us for telling lies God's whipped us brother Brown said a Christian will do what sin of sin a Christian will reap a tub full why cuz you should know better you should know better and in in the adoption stage as a little child God doesn't whip us when we first get started we'd be like the the little kid that um that uh what's her name Kathy sister Kathy uh and Chris you know when they came here brother K's niece niece I mean that little boy he knew knew he was doing wrong and he knew what he was getting and the first thing he done was this yeah well you know that we don't do that God doesn't do that with us when we're first little baby right God knows that we're human right so we don't Flinch cuz he's a loving God he's a God that says hey that's okay you know we're going to help you through this but now once we get and sat in a seat for about 20 years in the church and we get preached to then you better start doing some of this cuz it's coming and we deserve it if God brings it we deserve it right all right now we're not legalists and we're not life beaters and we're not children beaters amen wait a minute this is a new age our men our our husband beaters yeah I mean it used to be that you know you had the the men that that whipped the women but now I think we got some women that pretty much take care of the men like I told you about that that time I went to Gainesville you know and pulled up in that traffic light and a big old man and woman was sitting in that car and he popped her upside the head and grabbed her and started shaking her like that and I thought buddy if you continue that I'm going to get out of my car but it wasn't but about 2 seconds he let her go and that was his first mistake cuz buddy she come with a left and she hit him upside the head and his old head just went out the wind out the window and come back in and I thought I'm okay she's okay I'm not going to get involved but buddy she let him have it I can see that just as well in my mind as if it was yesterday she hit him about three times the the the the uh light turned green and they're still sitting there and I wasn't going to blow the horn I afid she might get out I wasn't worried about him anymore I was afraid she was going to get out and take care of me but she took care of business but now in at this age you can say well wife beaters and Men beaters but we're not any of that right right we don't we don't do that the rod of Correction is is supposed to be given but it's supposed to be given with love amen same way when I told you about whipping your child don't ever whip your child when it's what angry when you're angry don't do that okay right cuz you may hurt somebody you may hurt it uh you may hurt them physically you don't want to beat them physically right just give them a little spanking so I I hope we kind of covered all that well enough to where we all make mistakes right as adults as people that raise children and and you know we make mistakes but remember God doesn't make mistakes right amen so we talk about the spiritual aspect a little bit more now that that God gives us correction but you know what he does he keeps us he keeps us by the word of God and that's the correction that we get we don't have to get physically whipped right you know we we get whipped by the word and we know as we become more mature we know it's coming right cuz we say uh-oh here it comes cuz we did something wrong all right well the kids should be be the same way Josh turned 29 yesterday 29 for the first time for the first time yeah yeah made me old 29 years old and you know what I don't have to beat him I'd love to but I don't have to cuz he's his own person he he's he's his own he gets his own he has his own ability to to think and and we do the best we can but like mom always says the Bible says when they are older they want to apart from you when they're older right all right God's God's longsuffering with you and I when we're older brother Rand the gospel amen bring a child up in the way it should go right God bring a child up in the way it should go talking spiritual now right all right bring a child up the way it should go and when he gets older more mature he'll not depart from it right sure we backslide we do things wrong but you know what we're supposed to be getting that what getting to that chisel getting that home get holding that thing down where it gets more narrow and narrow as we go up right I'm and I'm trying to make a point here because I'm trying to I want to go into the spiritual aspect of it but we've got to remember that we can't keep making the same mistakes though right amen we can't do that right amen we got to come up a level uh I was reading um somebody one of our neighbors was giving some books away and it's a really neat book it's about this thick it was written by Smith Wigglesworth everybody know who Smith Wigglesworth is all right uh actually he died the same year in close to about the same month that brother Bram came on the scene all right so he died and then brother then brother Bram came on the scene but Smith Wigglesworth was known for a lot of things he he has been documented to raise have raised 23 people from the dead one man was already inbombed and in the casket and he was reporting that he that he prayed for him rais him from the dead so I was reading some of those things and and the whole part of this is is a lot of that book is his sermons and there little sermon Nets he preached every day to somebody every day Smith Wigglesworth preached every day to somebody yeah he said there's only one thing going to be in my house to read and that's the Bible he said all else is junk he never read they said he never read a newspaper he either read the Bible or some of his own study notes he read nothing else and great man of Faith he uh there was a man one time that was Apprentice of his that did not have any he his legs were cut off at the kneecaps okay they was cut off at the kneecaps both of them he said the Lord told him one night woke him up one night and said you go tell your servant that tomorrow for him to go down to the shoe shop tell him to get him a pair of shoes tell them what size he won and by the time they put the shoes down he'll have new legs well of course the guy was a little bit weary of that Smith Wigglesworth takes him down there South sets him down in the chair and tells the guy said what size do you want he says I want a size 10 by the time the man went back and they said he said he set the box down Smith Wigglesworth set a prayer put the box down got the shoes out here come a foot amen out of the man's p and there was a size 10t waiting on that shoe to get there what am I telling you they he lived a life never knew William Brown here's my point he never knew William Brown never knew of a seven seal right never knew of a of a one God cuz he was a trinitarian yeah he's traran he come up through actually he come up through the isua street movement him and and and Dr Lake and some of those others with with Daddy Seymour because you know what sister Anna you know we talked about Sunday about you not being able to sleep Monday night I got to bed about 1:45 in the morning and I set up all night and went through Smith wigglesworth's life the life of daddy Seymour and I couldn't sleep either she's having problems sleeping so just pray for just that she'll sleep but I took some of your sleep away from you on Monday cuz I stayed up till about 1:30 but I I really got into reading some of the things but what struck me was he lived such a life right that had nothing to do with the message of the hour right he died 1947 brother Brown came on the scene 1947 really preaching the word of God right y he come up FF Bosworth came up under him really first and then brother Brown came up you know right there with brother FF Bosworth but Smith wiglesworth I started reading some of his some of his um sermons and and you see how that the Holy Spirit progressed from Smith Wigglesworth to brother brandham because a lot of the things that brother brandham said Smith wesworth said in that book I can show it to you I can underline it look it's just almost verbatim I started to bring it tonight and read a quote I had a quote I was going to read that quote and ask you did you believe it and you'd probably say oh yeah that was brother Bram no that was Smith Borth right talking about the Holy Spirit about the Holy Spirit in encompassing our whole being yeah and taking us in a Rapture I mean here this guy's talking about going in a Rapture this guy's talking about the Holy Ghost being in us so much till like he said you you get an inspiration from God and you go tell a guy that don't have legs yeah that tomorrow he's going to have legs amen come on folks I mean this is getting off the sermon a little bit but but but what struck me was that that here was a man that was filled with the Holy Ghost under a trinitarian Doctrine amen read the word of God with a trinitarian Doctrine yeah but look at the power he had right you know why he lived an exemplary life right amen his life was so close to God he married a he married a lady and they only stayed married maybe I think about 16 or 17 years and she passed away had a couple of children had two two sons and a daughter I think it was but he lived straight on never got married again he lived straight on into the 40 you know into his 40s and 50s 60s '70s I think he died when he was like 88 years old he was born in 1850 something or something like that or 1880 something and he died in 1947 but you know what you say well that that's not watching that's not reading the prophet's message well it gives you a good background to show you that if you're not living right it ain't going to do you any good to read The Prophet's message okay okay we're not living an exemplary life first right I wish sometimes we could pull the message away and God forbid what I'm saying and forget about it yeah forget about it just get born again right get born again under what's in this Bible right here right amen that Jesus died for our sins Brother Gary that Jesus Christ came down and filled you with the Holy Ghost right right that didn't need a message right but then God did bring us a message Glory and here we are now God brought us a message on top of right of what Smith Wigglesworth had on top of what FF Bosworth had right amen the greatest message ever to to come to the face of the Earth yes Lord but I read you a quote last Sunday where we're missing it is in the life right right the walk the walk is where we're missing it amen get the walk right so you say what's that got to do with this this says right here go ahead brother Anderson the role of the male we're going through all these roles do you know if you're not in your role or your position yeah then you're out of the will of God right you're out of the will of God I'm sorry I didn't make the rules roll of the man the man needs to understand his role I told you many times that I I don't want somebody to just say like I've said uh when we first did this I know the Bible says a woman's not supposed to cut her ha why right why cuz she comes out from under her headship and becomes a man right she's in her own position she trims her hair then she comes under where a man says you're not supposed to have long hair and you're supposed to cut your hair right that's us we're supposed to cut her hair right if she cuts her hair she has took herself out from under the position that she's in not just don't cut your hair sister no you know what you're doing you're reflecting that you've forgotten your headship right amen and remember your ultimate headship is who Christ Glory so you're doing away with your headship you have no protection right right you have no protection you do the things you're supposed to do and you come down in the role of the female and you do what you're supposed to be doing this is a guy that's going to give an account yeah not you but if you come over here like this you're decep to a lot of things yeah that's why God had to put it down in in the book of Corinthians and all that to show headship even back when Adam he said now Eve what you did said you're going the man's going to have to rule over you because of what you did right but we got to remember too our head is who Christ Glory all right head every man is Christ head of every woman is a man amen stay under that you don't lose so these roles of the man and roles of the roles of the male and roles of the female is not just something I conjured up it's not just something that looks good it's scripture right break scripture and you're breaking the word of God and that makes you a what well a sinner the man needs to understand his role so he can know how to act and react to situations in a marriage what his position and and be obedient to that position because sisters whether you believe it or not we're supposed to be obedient too right amen we're supposed to be obedient too to our head Christ right the female should also understand what the male's role is so she can understand I want you sisters to understand your role and get in that role right amen what what the male's role is so she can help him what be a help meet what suitable someone suitable that's what help meet means suitable someone suitable to fulfill his role we can't fulfill our role as a husband if we don't have a good wife right God can't fulfill his role without having a wife right that's right that's right he can't remember he's not he's not complete remember Prophet said Christ the my God real he's not complete without us right not my rules he made the rules right but the rule is says that if you do come under his headship then guess what you get his protection right right sisters you see what I mean about you disobeying God you come out from under your headship God don't slide over here and protect you right he stays over here with the man you slide over here you have no headship and no protect you know what you've done you've elevated yourself right that's why brother brand said remember that quote I read to you from the church age book that you become Antichrist yeah right that's an antichrist Spirit when you come out from under the headship of your husband right cuz what do you do when you come out of the under the headship of Christ you think you become Christ and that was what what the devil wants you to do right so now the man needs to understand his role the woman needs to understand her role to do what to fulfill his role right the man according to the word of God right all right now let's go to Ephesians 5 here it is for the husband is the head of the woman even as Christ is the head of the church and he is the savior of the body now who is my body right June J's my body right she's the body God Gave Me Right amen hello I don't get an amen amen that's the body God gave me right right because what he's the savior of his body amen Christian body bride right right oh my let on to make you happy he's the savior of the body right all right head of the house second Timothy 2:6-7 the husband that labor Earth must be first partakers of the fruits consider what I say and the Lord give the understanding in all things that's what I said about understanding understanding a role that the husband is definitely sisters I'm sorry but we should be the final Authority right who's the final authority of our headship Christ Christ is the final Authority we don't go to ask somebody else we don't go to ask the neighbor or the postman or the guy down at the convenience store no our headship is Christ we do what he says we don't get a second opinion amen amen now I'm not telling you that you need to do you understand what I'm saying don't get drug around amen remember because if if your husband takes himself out from under the headship of Christ and you stay where you're supposed to be look you still got the protection of Christ does everybody understand you see what I'm saying here's Christ this light is Christ here's the man and here's the female if he does according to the word of God and you do according to the word of God it stays just like that look at the protection you got right all right now you cut your hair try to rule the house you come over here God don't move over here where you're at right right right your husband don't move over here where you're at unless you're both lost right right but now what if this happens right if a husband comes out from under the headship of Christ you stay right here right you're protected amen amen you ever seen that before I it's hard you say well that was simple well to me it shows that if everybody's in their position Glory you stay right here look at your protection right right you got God and you got your husband and yourself sisters y'all ought to be the y'all ought to have the all warm and fuzes yeah the problem is a lot of you are doing this and nothing's coming over here with you yeah Mery come on now right oh yeah come on the husband is the final Authority just like Christ is the final Authority amen the next door neighbor or the talk show host is not your husband right right right right right brother right yeah all right s Kathy amen I like brother R said that's right you got that right that's right better believe it that's why better believe it that's better believe it head of the house all right let's go to the next one now remember as and we we were speaking before the husband needs to take the initiative or to initiate to instruct in the principle of something to start so if you got a problem and you need to talk about something husbands you really are the ones that your wives are the weaker vessel they get caught up in all the drama feelings emotions you're supposed to be the stable one Christ doesn't get caught up in all these emotions he's the stable one all right he's the one that that that takes care of all the situations hey brothers and sisters he was the greatest initiator yeah he started his whole thing right amen when he said let there be and all this came with it right he said let there be he was the greatest initiator but you got to remember you come on down a little bit father he's the protector he's the one same way with Christ Christ was the initiator to instruct and the principle of something to start let there be but he knew the way we were going to be so he said wives instead of being like this in the garden that's what I meant to do see this right here in the garden this is the way it was right God come down talked to man and man and wife was one co-equal but when what happened you had to do this cuz this is a weaker vessel she caused the fall right right right right so here we go Christ had to initiate it though he come down and said I'll put enmity right Adam didn't stand up brother Dan Adam didn't stand up and do that did he he couldn't but God said I'll py in other words I'll initiate this thing I'm the one that started it and I'm the one that's going to finish it there's a good headship same way with a husband and I know as as as human beings we do things wrong sure yeah right God don't do things wrong no what he initiated and started ain't going to get off on a rabbit Trail some he's going to see it go all the way through what if we stay in our position so will we Glory he's the initiator right of all and here it comes down to us we stay right here right guess what we are benefactors of that benefactors of his resurrection benefactors of all things holy ghost coming on that Pentecost we're benefact of all that right cuz what's he doing he's restoring it back to here right right amen thank you Lord God and Christ amen right then what we come right up and we're little Messiah right we are God right right let me tell you something when we get to heaven this is just the way I see it when we get to heaven everything's going to be restored back right amen amen if they want to see Christ they're going to see brother dead they're going to know that we live in that Temple because we did one thing Christ was our head and we let him take everything that we had and do away with all of our sins cuz what happened a lot of the others come out from under their headship right father go father son Holy Ghost is not here right right that was in permissive right but in finality it never was brother Brown said it come from hell right father son Holy Ghost baptism and all those doctrines what happened man come out from under the headship of Christ word amen set up their own Doctrine their own Christ and it become anti- word that's why you're over here that's why they have no protection right you and I have protection amen under the headship of Christ and so you sisters you have protection under the headship right of your of your spouse and you man that can't stop gawking looking at women immorally dressed the idols of the day you man that hadn't got enough real Grace in your heart to make your wife and kids quit doing such thing as that the love of God isn't Anchored In Your Heart don't be called sons of God you're still in Sodom a man that can't take over his own house God ordained him to do that God ordained him to and you deacons that's married two or three times and you men that's run out on your wives and try to hold your profession you women that cross the other way all those things like that don't worry you people that hide behind the cloak of a church what right they're hiding behind the cloak of another head sh right my brother brand when he come to that seal and he saw he saw the head I believe he saw the headship correctly then right he saw Christ in his bride Christ in his church then he saw these denominations what went a whing right come out over here I was reading you know reading the fifth and sixth seal back again and you you see where where God give Grace and all those things but you also see that inside that Antichrist system there was a group of people amen trying to pull them away from it right all right that's why God's going to destroy the world that's why God's got to destroy this thing amen y that Mom and Daddy brought cuz it was wrong right amen it was wrong let's go to the next one I thought I was going to have plenty of time and I just got started and should love one another Believers should separate themselves from the world don't just take it now lightly here's a prophet don't take it lightly separate yourself from the world now you people that's listening to this on tape you women you men you listen a minute if you ever believe me you believe it now yeah it's time to quit fussing with one another believe the message of the Bible believe Jesus Christ and love and honor and respect one another man respect your wives you respect your homes bring your home together because remember this lamb was for the the home not just one person in other words that's what he was saying not just one for the whole home two had to be brought everything had to be brought in we should love each other and Believers should separate themselves from the world amen amen all right next man is given the role to govern govern means to rule or be the Lord to control or direct or strongly influence the ACT and conduct of others remember you're going to give an account for your wife right she's not going to ever have to give an account for you right all right all right right amen stay under your role though cuz if you don't then over here he don't have to give account for this sister that comes over here that right exactly right you don't have to do that cuz she's come out from under her role or her position right right you it's hard that's why brother say it's hard to marry an unbeliever cuz you're always like this right you're out of position right you're out of sords Unto the woman he said I will greatly multiply my sorrow and thy conception in sorrow Thou shalt bring forth children and thy desire shall be to thy husband and he shall rule over thee right all right or be the Lord all right let's go to the next quote adoption do you know it's wrong for you not to be the husband of your house this is the prophet do you know it's wrong for you not to be the husband of your house your wife get a little temper spell and kick you out the door and you say yes bless your heart honey I'll come right back do you know how can you be a tender at the house of God when you can't even control your own house that's exactly right do you know sister that your husband is not only your husband but he is your ruler right God said so well this is not listen this is not something you can blame Brothers on you can't blame your husband right blame God if you're going to blame somebody cuz he's the one that said it God said so yeah this wasn't devised by man right right this was devised by the almighty because he's perfect and if we do what he perfectly says we become perect right amen God said so because if the husband was not deceived the woman was deceived and you preachers will continue to make women pastors and preachers in your church we know that's not for here knowing that the word of God condemns it oh did you also know that that William Seymour you know Daddy Seymour his wife was a preacher too he married a woman preacher and they both preached in Aza Street when the Holy Ghost fell she wasn't preaching then but she was a preacher that preached on up to 1912 and on up a little bit further than that so so I mean they had a lot of they had a lot of loose ends untied remember brother R said the seventh angel messenger had to come to what T all the loose in amen they were wrong in their scriptural aspect of that part of the word but that part of the day they were living in was the Holy Ghost fell giving the gifts back into the into the church you ought to read some of the Articles uh I've got um also a big thing from the zusa street Mission from 1906 about 1912 it's actually um newspaper articles that Daddy Seymour wrote telling how the Holy Ghost fell on this person and how the Holy Ghost fell in Scotland and Ireland and all these places it's really neat I'll let you read it if you want to but it's really neat to see how the Holy Ghost didn't just it fell ATA Street in in Los Angeles but it when it started it covered the world Amen all right I'll pour out my spirit upon All Flesh right all right let's go to the next one why didn't Abraham why didn't God kill Sarah sitting there denying and lying right in the face of God sitting there as a mortal man eating flesh eating bread drinking milk he said why did Sarah laugh back there in the back behind me behind him in the tent he had never seen her saying this how can these things be she said I never said it uh-oh my tell God that he's a liar to his face yeah but he couldn't take her who God couldn't take Sarah why she's a part of Abraham she called him cuz she was right here amen if if Sarah would have been out here dead right right exactly she was under the protection of Abraham brother R said she was a little weak in her faith yeah but she was covered by Abraham right all you sisters out you ought to shout hallelujah you're covered by your mail by your or by your spouse right right amen she said I never said it but he couldn't take her why she's a part of Abraham amen he couldn't hurt her without hurting Abraham right now you women see where you belong and the Bible said you women be like Sarah he's quoting the scripture we just read in a Peter now you women say where you belong and the Bible says you women be like Sarah was which adorned herself in modesty prayer lived honest and true her own husband loving him so much that he that she called him her Lord ruler ownership all right now what are you supposed to do men we're supposed to be responsible right out of all this initiating and all this uh all this governing we're to be responsible right amen for who her and your action right all right so it throws it back really sisters to us stay right here a lot less problem staying right here exactly you he's got to give an account for your for your actions but you never have to give an account going that way right initiating govern but being he head and being the one who is to initiate things also means that the man is responsible Butz if you initiate something you're responsible for it if you govern over something uh the government of the United States is what they're responsible for the people of the United States of America right so your husband is responsible for you anyone in a leadership role is responsible for those they are to lead and will answer before God for their role all right so be responsible all right now 29 make sure I'm all right okay now now I think that will get that man and woman now woman is let me get this in right good now this is questions and answers so that you can see it see woman is subject to her husband and the Bible said that a man should rule over his wife but how they've changed that the woman rules over the man now you stay home John you're not going and that settles it yes my dear see let me tell you something Mister you are going to have to answer for your wife but your wife is never going to have to answer for you y you are the head of the woman and God is the head of man therefore he said let the man cut his hair because of Christ and let the woman have her hair for if she cuts her hair she dishonors her husband now what she does she dishonors her husband husband right see what I mean or what the scripture says that really brought that to life to me better I me the only one out of this whole 12 sermon this may be the only Revelation that I got was about this headship of a woman cutting her hair and and a reason why you can't just look at somebody and say don't do this right explain to them why amen same thing with you kids I wanted to kind of get into that Sunday but I didn't have time that's why dad would sit down and he' talked to us explain explains to them why you going to whip them yeah don't just tear them up just explain to them right this is why that we don't do this it's not just cuz I'm daddy now that works a good bit or I'm mama okay that works all right but still you need to kind of sit down and inform them right so they don't do it again and this is why you're getting a whon right cuz you did XYZ and if you do X Y again XYZ again same results is going to happen right all right same way with God God laid that plan right out for us he said if you do this then XYZ is going to happen if you do XYZ same thing is going to happen all right let's go to number 20 or 30 yeah number 30 listen here the man is the ruler this is question AC on Hebrews don't you think you can rule a house talking about the women you're not the ruler of the house you're absolutely you're not a slave now but you're helpmate and Adam the man has to rule over his wife and he's responsible solely now I'm not responsible for for any of your other wies I'm responsible for my wife all right cuz she's one with me amen that's the that's the body God gave me to nurture and govern and be responsible for think about that God makes a man answer for his wife now read and see if God says that now he continues on all right the next part God is still a ruler above man be careful how you men use the role of Ruler all right without Christ in our heart this headship rle can be misused and it will if you don't have Christ in your heart see you won't have enough Christ in you then you're going to be leaning to what emotions of a human being right right we don't want to lean to the Motions of the human being man we want to be what Christlike yeah we want to be Christlike without Christ in our heart this headship Roe can be misused and even abusive swi sisters don't marry somebody that's not a Christian cuz you're going to run into the human part of him eventually usually about a couple months after the honeymoon if that long you'll see the real you yeah right right but if he's a Christian he's got a head right that's right right see how simple this is with a Christian he's got a head already so he's got an answer to him right right and you come under right here and everything's okay but you marry a man that's out here who's his head Satan right period anything outside of this light Christ is what Antichrist all right I'm not saying you married the Antichrist but you may think that in a few months but but if you marry somebody here then you take that headship role reminds us Christian men that we've got somebody that we're answering to which is Christ we're answering now remember he does have to answer for us cuz we're the bride yeah but see remember he's spiritual he molds us and makes us into His Image we can't mold our wives into our own image like he does spiritually to the bride so remember that don't try to make your wife you exactly don't do that you're individual people amen okay we went through that in the U in the dve Ry course we went through it's called a dis d c and it's it's um dominant what's the eye sister rea don't call on me tonight but anyway it tells the the role that you are the characteristics yeah what's the DC d d is dominant of course you know what that done to me put me under the D I always said I was intelligent somebody said idiot but influencing that's D dominant influencing s is stable stable C is and see is compliant so we kind of went through that though and to make my point June was F C and I was d i you said well that's opposite you ever heard the term Opposites Attract if you're both dominant trouble amen amen you both D both is in trouble but a little D and I and a little s and C makes it perfect me and her right yeah that's why we have a good marriage I believe because we compliment each other but that's just something that man has done but God's done the same thing right God's took the role of man and said this is the way you're supposed to be right here women this is the way you're supposed to be right here if you get out of that you're out of the will of God right stay right here right kind of too simple isn't it all right be careful how you men use this role of ruler without Christ in our heart this headship role can be misused and even abused abusive men should do nothing harmful or hurtful do not be a dictator remember the woman is required to be under subjection to the husband as long as he does not go against God's word right that's right if he goes against God's word sisters look what he done look what he done not you or God look what he's done but you're still okay you're right here that's why the Bible says if you can live with an unsaved mate there in what is it Corinthians or somewhere I think Dad read it the other day or somewhere in there if you want to live with them go ahead and live with them you know this is going to happen but sometimes these people can be right right one what did we read there in Peter how that the actions of the woman without saying A word without a conversation can actually convert that man right or vice versa your life that's what I talking about your life right well actually convert that person if you so desire to live where that man says okay you go on to church if you want to Christ is not my head but if you want to stay here and do what God said that's okay is that what Paul said that's okay same way this way right the unbelieving wife can be saved by the believing husband right but still this is there's a problem here this is still out of sorts right okay now let's keep going and we're going to be long time here tonight dwell according to knowledge that's what we read in 1 Peter 3:7 likewise you husbands dwell with them according to knowledge that's what I'm trying to give you in this in this series you men I'm trying to give you the knowledge right not how to bind your wife no this ought to set you free right your sisters it ought to set you really free hey he's my head I have to stay right here we have human problems right here right I mean we're not superp spiritual enough to realize that we're not human right you going to have problems but if you stay right here somewhere it's going to line right back up sure see dwell according to knowledge the male must understand the woman's weaknesses right and dwell according to knowledge likewise ye husbands dwell with them according to knowledge giving honor unto the wife as unto the weaker vessel and as being HS together of the grace of life that your prayers be not hindered right all right let's go to the next one Proverbs 31:10 who can find a virtuous woman did you read that right who can find if you're a godly man you'll find a virtuous woman see who can find a virtuous woman right if you're led by God you'll find a virtuous woman amen gets easier as we go huh for her price is far above rubies and we'll read the rest of that because there's a great right at the very end there's a great uh that's Proverbs 31 10 if you read 11 and 12 it'll really throw this into perspective but we're not going to read till the end Proverbs 12:4 says a virtuous woman is a crown to her husband but she that maketh ashamed is as rotness in his bones right I'm not going to go there because it it can be you get a woman out from under the headship of God she's anti- word she's got an antichrist Spirit on her amen I'm sorry right you're not under the headship of your husband you have an antichrist Spirit you're rotten this to his bone okay all right let's keep going this is Brother R in his life story so but now a good woman is a jewel in a man's Crown she should be honored see my mother's a woman my wife is and they're lovely now I've got thousands of Christian sisters who I highly respect but if they can respect what God made them a motherhood and a real queen that's all right she's one of the best things that God could give a man was a wife besides salvation a woman is a the best thing if she is a good woman or a good wife but if she isn't Solomon said a good woman is a jewel in a man's Crown but an orary one or no good one is watering his blood and that's right it's the worst thing could happen so a good woman if you got a good wife brother you ought to respect her with the highest am amen amen that's right you should do that a real woman and children if you've got a real mother that stays home and tries to take care of you keeping your clothes clean sending you to school teaching you about Jesus you should honor that sweet old mother with all that's in you you should respect that woman yes sir because she's a real mother all right next one here's what we got we rued by the word Hebrews 13:7 this is right before Hebrews 13:8 right remember them which have the rule over you now we talking natural and spiritual here but in natural remember those who have the rule over you who have spoken unto you the word of God now if you as a as a husband do not speak the word of God to the to the wife what's right no rule over you then right right who has spoken unto you the word of God whose Faith follow in other words not just B jangling not just saying hey you got to not do this you got to not do that and he goes and smokes a cigarette behind the corner or he or he don't go to church you come to church or he tells you you got to go to church and he lays out a head here right it's like brother Brown said one time he said as long as I'm King on that Hill my wife's coming to church with me that's what he said he said as long as I'm King on the hill he said that's the way it's going to be he said but if things are ever different he said that's when she's going to go I didn't bring that quote but it's pretty much ver him what he said cuz they were talking about something and he said when I he said Brothers he said when I can't be the king of my of my Palace he said somebody's got to go all right so long as long as my wife's in my household she's going to come to church with me whose Faith follow whose Faith follow you know why she comes to church with me cuz she knows she's going to get something out of the service not cuz I'm up here and not cuz I came with her but she has faith right whose Faith follow what follow the spoken word of God considering the end of their conversation all of us right considering the end of all of our conversation then the next one is Jesus Christ same yesterday today and forever so ruled by the word whys you ruled by the word of God we're all ruled by the word of God you're not ruled by your husband you're ruled by the word of God if he's inside the word of God then you have a ruler called a husband amen but it is the word of God all right everybody understand say amen amen okay all right next and you who claim to be a Son of God where's your principles if the woman ain't out of her place aren't you a Son of God aren't you the one that's a higher stronger vessel as the Bible says she's weaker then if she's weaker then show yourself a man of God yeah tell her say sister you're in the wrong that's right yeah I've done it and other Christians has done it and you will always do it as long as you're a Christian but show yourself right you're a Son of God you you have more power over yourself than the woman does if she's weaker recognize that's what I said recognize her weakness right recognize her to be weaker understand her mistakes and things like that and try to correct her say sister we're Christians shouldn't do that see but a real man be a Son of God and watch the women what is he saying be you be a Son of God and watch the women follow behind you right right you put yourself in this position I don't have to worry about J coming to church with me right she's not honoring me by coming to church she's honoring God but she knows that my faith in coming here to get something she's going to come here and get something right amen same way with any one of us and if you're a Son of God be strong be a real man if you're not that way stay at the altar till you become that and shun the very appearance of evil all right let's go here's the one I like cuz men this is what our whole this is what everything you can you can say well it's govern and it's rulership and it's this and that and the other but to me this is it right here husbands were to be a servant leader remember it says honor the wife as the weaker vessel right all right a servant leader living for others yeah live for your spouse right live for your wife right husbands love Christ live for us didn't he righten husbands love your wives even as Christ also loved the church and gave himself there's your servant leader gave himself didn't expect anything right gave himself right for it Philippians 2:37 let nothing be done through Strife or vain Glory but in loneliness of Mind Let each esteem other better than themselves H let's read that one more time let each esteem other better than themselves amen look not every man on his own things look what I got remember I was talking about the selfish thing we still got a problem with that yeah okay look at me look at what I got look at what I can do look at my position look not every man on his own things but every man also on the things of others right that don't mean get in somebody's business that don't mean getting in somebody else's business you understand what that says but every man what look in other words brother Dale has to be the shepherd of your the flock he has to live among you see you're weaknesses cuz he's the husband yeah sees your weakness as the weaker vessel we as the congregation are the weaker vessel right cuz brother R said if your pastor is not preaching the word what get out from undering because he's what he head Chip's over here he's over here amen go find somebody that's over here right all right that's why I like to get into the spiritual part and maybe do a series on that but but maybe some other time I want D to start start Revelations 5 he's been promising us for a month he needs to get into Revelations 5 and do some digging let nothing be done but you know what if we don't live a life if we don't live the life Revelations 5 is going to mean nothing to you and me it's not going to mean one thing to us if we don't make it if you're not filled with the Holy Ghost and if you're not the man of the house and if you're not doing these primer things that God tells us about in The Prophet's message not even a prophet's message just out of the Bible just out of the Bible right then don't worry about Revelations 5 that's the redeemed that's the ones that did things right amen right amen exactly right look not every man on his own things but every man also on the things of others in other words I don't sit in the congregation and go well this is for me no you know what sometimes i s in the congregation and go Lord it must be for somebody else go this is not hitting me I'm not talking about hitting me but I'm talking about quickening right right right brother K we sat here for 40 years and you didn't get 2,000 sermons and they all got quickened at the same time no that's right no brother klie gets a little here gets a little there right little here right little right that's right and you know what I might be sitting right there and him sitting right here and God just come down and reveal something to him and I'm over there going there's a cobweb over there in the corner of the church I don't know what we need to build on you know brother College over there going part on Lord well that's the way it is okay that's just the way it is but when we're up here see we're servant leaders every man also on the things of others let this mind be watch how Paul goes to where it's supposed to start right here right let this mind being you which all was also in Christ Jesus who being in the form of God thought it not robbery to be equal with God but made himself of no reputation money women and popularity yeah kill a preacher right money women and popularity popularity is selfishness right right but made himself of no reputation and took upon him he wanted to be took upon him the form of a servant right and was made in the likeness of men okay so everybody got that the servant leader amen men you ought to live for your wives cuz you going to give account for it you better start living with her and nurturing her and helping her right right that's just not running the vacuum cleaner and the and the dishwasher either right spiritually we should be helping our wives amen as a weaker vessel all right let's go to the next one I really appreciate our sisters in this church because a lot of them ask good questions there's a lot of these questions that you hear up here in the pull pit doesn't come from men cuz we know everything but you know what it comes from a lot of sisters that doesn't have a spouse sitting here right cuz they know where their headship come from so they know they ask the right question they know they can't ask their physical husband right that's why you remember money women and popularity a preacher has to watch out for that why because you are the spiritual head of that woman sitting there with no with no husband so you keep your distance what daddy said about not going don't go in a room with a sister by herself cuz that pull cuz we are we're the spiritual head of that woman if if she doesn't have a husband here why you have to be careful right be careful it may start as a little innocent Bible study and turn into something awful you know so amen amen come on people we're still humans living in a human body right so don't tempt that thing all of us any of you if a sister come don't don't think wrong of the sister but if sister wants to come to ask you something don't go off in a corner somewhere right that don't look good for one and it ain't Godly for the other right all right and you need to be asking him the questions anyway not somebody else all right and as we as CHR of course we all want to help I mean I don't want dadd to be burdened with all everything but but still he's he's our head he's the final Authority right whether you like it or not it's a final Authority go find you another final Authority if you need one amen and we as Christians should always watch what we do and what we say that we're perfectly honest to every man right and you if you can't be honest with your fellow man you certainly won't be honest with God right so how we serve God is we serve each other right how we serve God Is How We Serve each other right as honest as I would be with you that's as honest as I'll be with God and that's the same way with you to me we must be honest with each other in all of our dealings right and somebody is watching us you may not think that but there's an eye watching you and your life is influencing somebody right maybe it's a little child and that child May grow up to be another fny or moody or so forth we don't know but your life is influencing someone right so being that servant leader living for others but remember that others is watching you amen all right all right let's go nourish and cherish Ephesians 5: 28 29 show all men to love their wives as their own bodies praise the Lord right that's what I told him and I'm not saying this to be funny but I love the body that God gave me she's sitting back on the back row amen being a grandma but I love the body that God gave me cuz she's my body right right she's a reflection of me right she does a very good job of it so I want men to love their wife as their own bodies he that loveth his wife loveth himself amen pretty easy that's why I love me I don't care whether you do or not God loves me my wife loves me so what's your problem he that loveth his wife loveth himself for no man ever hated his own flesh if she's bone of my bone and Flesh of My Flesh I can't hate I'm talking about my wife I can't hate her right but no man ever yet hated his own flesh same way with God because we're what bone of Christ amen bone and flesh of his flesh right for no man ever yet hated his own flesh but nourisheth and cherisheth it even as the Lord the church now the word cherish means to treasure value greatly nourish means to nurture or help alone remember we kind of went through the nurturing part with the kid how to cultivate the crop same way with husband and wife growing up okay nourishes and cherishes let's get finished right here this will be the role of the ma of the male and Colossians 2:19 and not holding the head from which all the body by joints and bands have nourishment having nourishment ministered yeah right here yeah this where you get your nourishment right here amen nourishment Minister and knit together increases with the increase of God Amen not man right increases with the increase of God in other words God will give you increase if you nourish and knit together your body but if any First Timothy but if any provide not for his own and especially for those of his own house he ha denied the faith y'all want to read that and it's worse than an Infidel he has denied the faith amen come on people right and is worse than an Infidel all right let's read the last quote right here for the man I know th propy but they aren't Rich there it is again see him walking up down the midst of the church like a father he is looking down upon his family he is the head of his household he is the provider he is the protector now brother R was talking about God but I thought I'd put this in here for us to do the same thing you and I are what the father over the family you're the head of the household you're the provider you're the protector talking about you men but God is same way with us yet he looks on at their poverty oh how the untutored believer stumbles at this how can God bear to look upon his own in a time of need and not just stop it all just give in and lavish everything material upon them so headship is established by being what a Godly leader amen you can't be the head if you're not the leader right right amen can't be the head unless you're the leader right all right so let's take our leadership role man and nurture our house right cherish our body nourish our body right what if your wife has a need she's to come to you first right right right come to you first and if you can't handle in a Godly manner she needs to go and find a deacon or go and find somebody that's why the deacons are given to protect the widows and the orphans cuz the Widow don't have a head except for Christ right so in the church in the church the deacons are to take care of the widows and orphans right okay I mean that's just the way God God's got this thing laid out perfect we just get it like this all the time yeah you know scatter all this out but but now let's talk about the the female the woman female rooll of the female all right we're not going to read well let's read yeah let's read hold on let's read the first first couple of verses cuz this is this is specifically in this chap in this verse this is to the Fe to the woman yeah right all right likewise you wise being subjection to your own husband that if if any obey what if any that if any husband obey not the word that's what it says right I'm not trying to move the word or add to or take away right amen cuz that's what it says that if any obey who they talking about if any husband right obey not the word they also May without the word without going bless God this is it right here without that can be won by the convers ation right of the W while they behold your Chase conversation coupled with fear all right now that's not fear like Adam had that's but the fear of God all right who adorning let it not be that outward adorning or planting of hair wearing of gold and putting on a perel you know why you can do all that still now and go to hell right exactly that's right but you can't do this and die and go to hell right verse four but let it be the hidden man of the heart right because the hidden man of the heart is going to bring all that out right all right can't get a holy ghost F woman to Bob her hair you can't get a holy ghost F woman to U wear pants or or wear things or makeup you can't you can't get her to do it why it's not in her right go but let it be the hidden man of the heart and that which is not corruptible the only thing is Incorruptible and that's the word of God right even the ornament of a meek and quiet Spirit which is in the sight of God of great price for after this manner in the old times the holy women sisters you ought to shout it says holy women right it's always talking about the holy man and not it said the holy women right H why because you did these things in that order for after this manner what after this manner yeah after you do all this right but for M for after this manner in the Old Times Holy Women also who trusted in God adorned them themselves being a subjection unto their own husbands in other words they got in their position right even as Sarah obeyed Abraham calling him Lord whose daughters you are as long as you do well and are not afraid with any amazement right in other words it doesn't surprise you all right likewise your husbands dwell with them according to knowledge giving honor unto the wife to the weaker vessel and as being HS together not SE separate together of the grace of life this is our problem people our prayers are hindered yeah because we're not in our right position right all right now remember all right let's go let me go back one here remember the double Covenant unto the woman he said I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception this is your role now and sorrow Thou shalt bring forth children and thy desire shall be to thy husband and he shall rule over thee right you remember we talked about the double Covenant right all right let's go to the next one now the woman female wife whatever you want to call it needs to know what God expects of her her husband needs to understand her role also so you Brothers you don't have to turn the tape off and go to sleep and sit back and think well I've got it made no remember you got to answer for her so you better know what her actions is whether they good or bad right right right the male is told to dwell with her according to knowledge amen the men should take as many notes as the female because a man is responsible for her actions and as a leader her head it is your role to help her correct her action right she can't correct them on her own all the time cuz she's the weaker vessel all right remember you will answer husbands you'll answer for your wife's action right so you better pay attention to what your wife's doing all right let's go Genesis 2:18 and the Lord said Lord God said it is not good that the man should be alone I will make him and help me for him all right First Corinthians every man prophesying or Pro praying or prophesying having his head covered dishonor his head all right here we go with the scripture but every woman that prayeth or prophesies with her head uncovered dishonor her head that is not her natural head that's on her shoulders right amen right that's not talking about the head that's sitting on your shoulders that's talking about the guy that's sitting beside you tonight your head huh dishonor her head that's why brother Brown said you can put her away cuz what she's took another headship right you can't marry again right but if she moves over here and takes another headship you can divorce her yeah right cuz really what she's done is she's committed fornication yeah she's being with another husband yeah amen right she's being with another husband that makes her unclean right now she's got to pray ask God to forgive her come back over here it's not back like this right it's left you you can't come back and say well bless God I've been forgiven now I can tell you what to do that's what woman has done in preaching that's why a woman can't preach same thing not just cuz she can't preach cuz she's done what arship authority over her head right and the scripture can't be broke right in Genesis it said you must be the ruler and the wife be down here amen all right for if the woman be not covered what say she need to be shaven for if the woman be not covered let her also be shorn but if she be but if it be a shame for a woman to be Shor or shaven let her be covered for a man indeed ought not to cover his head for as much as he is the image and glory of God but the woman is the glory of the man so you cut your hair you come out under the glory of the man out from under the glory of the man what in other words you come out from under the protection right come on right cut your hair you're out from under anything right you can't be under God right you're under Satan right but the woman is the glory of the man for the man is not of the woman but the woman of the man neither was the Man created for the woman but the woman for the man for this cause ought the woman to have power on her head this is her natural head because of the Angels she not have a power over us no right she has to have power on her head because of the Angels now looked up that Angels brother BR said those angels were men yeah there's no female angel right so you have power over her head because of the men right what the men Messengers The Men Angels cuz if you don't if you cut your hair you're Earthship in power over man or the angels I didn't bring that quote but it's back there somewhere where brother talks about angels somebody asked him about that and he said the Angels is men there's never been a woman Angel right EX what a man so it's because of the men is a reason you don't catch your hair cuz the man's here you're here right you're not have to have power over your headship right all right because of the angels all right let's go 159 now here this is this is the quote here now a woman is not meant to have an iron disposition she is according to the holy scriptures now this is not somebody's idea this is according to the word of God she is to be submissive to the male that is Comm demanded of her woman who is truly female all female will be of that disposition not a doormat no real male makes a female a doormat but she will want to be under will want to be under Authority and not rule over the man for he is the head of the house if she breaks that image that God made for her she's perverted right any male that well here we go any male that lets the woman take authority has also broken that image and he's perverted wow he's perverted why cuz you got to answer for her right you let her continue what she's doing it perverts you right that is why a woman cannot wear that which pertaineth to a man or cut her hair cuz why she URS Authority above the man if she does that when she does she is intruding into the male domain right taking Authority and perverting herself and when a woman invades the pull pit which is commanded she must not do she shows what P Spirit she is of being a dominating female is Antichrist and the seeds of the Roman Catholic Church are in her though she may deny it ever so vinant but when it comes to the word of God let God be true and every man's word be a lie amen all right so that one kind of covers everything now let's read a few notes we got about 10 minutes because she was made for man and because of the Angels the woman is to have long hair it is assigned to God and man she is under man's Authority right that's why everybody started cutting their hair they come out from under the authority of God and man right and started perverting look what this is all perverted World why women started cutting their hair she is under man's Authority outside of that they're perverted your LGH ha show it's a sign to God and man that you have subjected yourself you have given everything you have to God and to your husband right amen and she is under man's Authority outside of that they're perverted yeah not unless the woman sees or understands you got to see it sisters you got to understand that you're made for the man it is more difficult for the wife to truly be happy and a submissive role if you don't understand right in other words if you don't understand this if it's just dos and don'ts like we come all come up under yeah do this don't do that but if you put it in the word of God like I'm doing it and showing the headship right you see that there's your role stay in it unless the woman sees or understands that she is made for the man it is more difficult in other words you'll be rebellious in other words you'll be what you'll want to URS of authority over a man cuz you think he ain't got no business telling you what to do right well if he tells you the word of God it's not him telling you that right it's God in him telling you that all right that she's made for the man it's more difficult for the wife to truly be happy cuz I've seen it you've seen it in a marriage relationship in a message women come into the message and and men treat them like dogs and make do this and don't do that they're not happy they're not happy right cuz they don't understand right they've just been told to do this told to do that exactly well if you'll sit down and explain to them cuz she's a weaker vessel she's the one that goes by the emotional part you have to tell me why cuz you're the weaker vessel I'm talking about the woman you're the weaker vessel do you have to say you have to tell me you're my head tell me tell me why all right let's go we're not going Ephesians 5:22 wives submit yourselves unto your own husbands as unto the Lord no the wife is given the responsibility to carry out God's plan as a suitable helpmate see you're part of the plan you're not just you know brother Brown say dog meet and all that stuff but remember he said a virtuous woman Jewel in a man's Crown right what but she you're given a responsibility to carry out God's plan as a suitable helpmate so you are part of the plan yeah her responsibility is to be complimentary to her M right to submit means to give over or yield to the power or authority of another suitable when you talking about suitable help me appropriate fitting becoming complimentary I've talked about accessoriz she's an accessory she's a help me right complimentary an expression of Praise Commendation an award or an admiration right right what are we to Christ we're a reward yes sir to him right right we're his victory right amen right we're his glory you know those clothes brother Brown said we're his victory we're his glory right why because he comes becomes submissive to not his own will but he wanted us to partake in his life that's what I want June June to partake in my life but I want it to be a Godly life I don't want to be in some junk right but complimentary your your wives you should be complimentary to your husband an expression of Praise or Commendation now calling him stupid in a crowd is not being complimentary that's not a compliment remember what I told you have your arguments at home okay cuz you're going to all you have me home yeah all right but you got to remember you still got to come back to this yeah right here H you all right let's go and the time had come for Abraham the great patriarch and servant of God to make a decision and this decision was that he would decided just on his own son Isaac that he'd waited 25 years for and had received him as one from the dead and know that he was a called and separated messenger of God and there was a time come when he had to make the decision who would be his helpmate to carry out the plan of God remember Abraham he messed up cuz he went to Hagar thought he was going to fulfill the plan with the Earth that wasn't the right one God told him it had to be through who Sarah his wife you see God don't make all of our decisions right he doesn't that's right we're free moral agents we have decisions we make but if we'll go through the process of of praying and just like the praying and looking and you know and all that the planning and praying and looking that's in your Christian Life too people it's not just people looking for a for a natural mate to go through life in no that's that's the life with God you might got to plan things you got to look at things you see God don't make all of our decisions there's many times that God doesn't tell us prophets just what to do because they have to make the decision remember the remember the prophecy by Danny Henry he said it was the way you chose right God didn't say I chose this for you William brandom that would be God putting you through a tube and pulling you through it God's not like that he gave the prophet a choice he said because of the choice you made a greater portion of Heaven that's what he said right here doesn't tell these prophets just what to do cuz they have to make the decision there's no decision that we have to make just wait every move on God then there's no over overcoming on our part exactly and sometimes they make the wrong decision God an God's anointed prophets makes the wrong decisions and many times they're dece right we got to pray all right let's go to the next one going to run out of time I help Med is to be involved that's why I like this course that we're doing with with the financial peace it's involved you know you'll hear some of the testimony boy and Janet they they come closer together because they everything's involved yeah I I don't I don't I'm the head of my house but you know what I don't want to rule over everything yeah jun's got her little rulership she's got brother mown told her over the children things of the of the running of the household and stuff like that that's not my job but my decisions are up here and she's here making the decisions that she Mak that's why you're not supposed to be a um a dictator dictator makes every decision every move you make you got to no you never have to come in the morning and say hey honey what do you want me to do today no I just read you we make decision right but the help me is to be involved with whatever God has called her husband to do here's where I think the importance of the role of the wife comes into view to do two things support and understand her mate support means to Bear hold up maintain sustain under trial under trial that doesn't sustain while we're having a party that says trial understand means to perceive the meaning of like I said to see to see means to understand to perceive the meaning of to be thoroughly familiar with what I'm trying to get you men to be thoroughly familiar with your wife and your wife to be thoroughly familiar with your husband we we we think we're so spiritual that we got to be so involved and we got to know everything about God and don't know a thing about our wife don't know a thing about our husband yeah primary things brother Bram said ABCs get the ABCs right then let's work on going out the statue of a perfect man together all right now let's go possessing all things brother said and Abraham as we understood wasn't any special person in the side of the world and otherwise he wasn't a king or a monarch you remember that Abraham was a king he wasn't a potentate he wasn't somebody that everybody looked up to God just said hey Abraham follow me yeah right he was just a man and he had married his half sister which was Sarah and probably married her when she was a young woman and God had called him at the age of 75 to a life of service and it also included his helpmate right and right here we could start I believe that when God calls a man to service if he's a married man and he has a helpmate he calls his wife with him because they two are one so wherever we find later that's hard to follow and so wherever we find later on that God Poss possibly would have killed Sarah when she died of the Angel's message 25 years later when they were sending on the oak tree that day but when she laughed when the angel told her or told Abraham she's going to be mother and Sarah laughed within herself said how could I old how could I old 90 years old and her husband 100 her womb dried up for years body as good as dead then how could she ever have pleasure with her husband again and she laughed at herself and the angel with his back turned to the tent said why is sah laugh and she denied it now that's telling God to his face that he's wrong see and that would have took her life but God could not take Sarah because she was part of Abraham see and she was in the Covenant with him amen when he was circumcised she was circumcised with him right so she had to go with him she could so he God could not take Abraham or take Sarah without taking part of Abraham for these two are one amen all right now Titus 2 3 for the Aged woman likewise that they be in Behavior as becoming Holiness not false accusers not giving them much wine teachers of good things that they may teach the younger women to be sober to love their husbands to love their children to be discreet chased keepers at home good obedient to their own husband that's what you older sisters should be teaching the younger sister to be discreet chase keep it at home good obedient to own husband that the word of God be not blasphemed right that the word of God be not blasphemed wow pretty powerful huh all right let's go Proverbs 31:10 who can find a virtuous woman we're going to read this again for her price is far above rubies 31:27 she lookth well to the ways of her household and eateth not the bread right of idleness idle mind is what the devil's workshop amen all right so we're going to skip right here um we're going to read this one and then I'm going to skip uh women working because you know you are you fill that out for yourself and that'll save us some time in Tucson Arizona we got a woman judge here in the city that's the reason the city is so polluted and we got a woman ain't got no business in politics she ain't got no business in the over any Authority in the church her place is a man's Queen at home outside of that she has nothing and we know that to be the truth you'll never find I know that sounds oldfashioned but I'm responsible what he was responsible for his body he was teaching a body of Believers right he was responsible for that body and I know that after my going away from this Earth them tapes and them books will be living on and many of you young children will find in the days to come that this is exactly the truth so it's not oldfashioned right this is exactly the truth because I speak it in the name of the Lord all right let's go to the next one man you will not be known by how successful you are in business or in a profession but you'll be known by how you fulfill your scriptural position and responsibility ex you're not going to be setting up in glory and get a a a a blue ribbon for making the most money in life no the Bible says we come here with nothing and we leave with nothing but our character right and that's developed from the time we're born now right so don't you know sure we need to make money we need to do good in business we ought to be the most outstanding of business people or or whatever possession profession we should be the most outstanding but you're only going to be known how you fulfill your POS scriptural position and responsibilities in life all right let's go to the next one and I'll tell you the scroll through cuz it talks about women working and all that stuff you know if brother sick or or anything like that when I've told you before your place is really at home right that's right the place is really a home that's exactly where they should be all right keep going to the next one just going to paraphrase here see look wonder if woman are willing to let your hair grow out wonder if you men have got enough courage to tell her that you're supposed to be the head of the house she's the neck she turns you that's contrary yeah do you think a shaking Revival will ever take these women out of these public offices policemen on the street and things she ought to be in the kitchen you think you'd ever be able to get her back at that again no sir she'll never do it cuz she's cuz listen no sir she'll never do it unless she gets saved then she do it right right you won't have to tell her nothing about it she'll find her place the Holy Ghost will lead her to her place right but say the Holy Ghost is leading me to that contrary to the word don't call that the Holy Ghost right all right now go the next one we'll skip it now no the why her position is to be The Keeper of the home support her husband and children and compliment the family by keeping the home clean and in order jobs outside the home takes a wife away from her scriptural position sorry if the wife can do both okay but if women working in an office or professional environment cannot always put her husband or children first they can't you can't always do that yeah and I've seen why these quotes are true in my past experience talking about me in the workplace the devil not only works on a female to disrupt the home but he will give the man so many things to do that he is never home yeah heard a kid tell me yesterday we were talking something and something was said and he said well my dad's never home that's pretty shameful they should both cherish the home life and be on the same page when balancing work and home so get together husband and wife career path should be discussed before marriage or even now all right so everybody understand that woman's position is supposed to be at home supporting a husband complimenting the family not complimenting your boss or supporting your boss that's not your job sorry I didn't make the rules but what happens is you're you're if you take yourself out of this position you're over here pleasing someone else I've seen it happen many times people in my own experience women you dress the best when you go to work you dress the best when you go to work you don't go into work with curlers and your house coat on yeah you dress the best you look your best you smell the best and you take all your problems to work and you start talking to a male about your problems and you start getting close and close I've seen it with my own eyes you get close and close why he's receptive to listen when you go home husband may not be recepted he may be asleep on the couch and wake up and say where's my supper this guy's receptive so then relationships start that's why brother Brown was so against it people that's why he was so against it right women working cuz he said he saw it in offices and stuff people coming in in the in the uh discernment he say many times he say I could tell you a lot of things about how these women what happens in offices right right all right let's go finish that it's 5 minutes afterno I'm sorry but I got to finish this all right keep going next surely that's not it thank you because he wants you to be a real housewife he wants you to reflect your influence upon another person the battery we got to get some new batteries but this one is one that was charged since Sunday somebody is watching your life you're influencing somebody God has to have a real what housewife huh is it not the battery it's but it's oh anyway can you hear me now okay all right let's go past that quote cuz I want to get to the end this is what I want you sisters to see right here keep going go to the next quote please savior or preserver remember while submit yourself to your own husband as unto the Lord for the husband is the head of the house even as Christ is the head of the church for he is the savior of the body right therefore as the church is subject unto Christ so let the wise so as as the church is subject unto Christ so let the wives be to their own husbands in everything amen cuz remember he's the Savior or preserver of the body which is you all right now let's go to the next one verse one tells us that a woman who has a husband that doesn't obey the word is to win him by the testimony we're back to First Peter by the testimony of her life she lives in front of him not by preaching or teaching or correcting him it is to be without the word right actions speak louder than words living a genuine Christian Life with a Meek and quiet spirit is a great price to God that's what he said there an ornament means adorning so what you put on in sincerity to your husband is powerful right right all right it's powerful now let's skip the quotes let's get down to Proverbs go all the way down to Proverbs 3110 through2 cuz we wor we've read Proverbs 31:10 so just shake yourself for a minute we'll be finished who can find a virtuous woman for a price is far above rubies now we stopped and not read that on purpose cuz I want to leave this for the last listen to this the heart of her husband does safely trust in her so that he shall have no need of spoil right amen amen she will do him good and not evil all the days of her life right look what you have sisters who can find a virtuous woman for her price is far above Ruby right the heart of her husband does safely trust in her so that he shall have no need of spoil right in other words no need of things going wrong she will do him good and not evil all the days of her life amen let's stand sorry to keep you past 9:00 but we had to finish that there's the role in your sisters right there if you want to take Proverbs and post it on your Proverbs 31: 10-12 I would use that as my theme I would pray praise God for a good husband praise God for a good wife amen all right there's a lot of work for all of us to do but you know what follow these steps amen follow what God has given us already all these years Bible's been written 15 years 1500 years but we just now come to the place to realize that this was for us I really believe that this is written for me amen me it's not written for Don F that's right sry buddy it's written for me amen we'll see you saying the same thing it was written for you to do what you're supposed to do
