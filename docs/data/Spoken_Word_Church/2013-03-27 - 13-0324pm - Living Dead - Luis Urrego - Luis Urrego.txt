afternoon and just let's pray and say God open our eyes amen so that's what we pray for you know you might wonder sometimes why we don't use the same songs as other churches you know only believe or whatever Amazing Grace I've always used the song to bring out a minister as to what I'm thinking about what I'm on to Open the Eyes of her heart yeah we may see the words right but you know what then we hear the song and it plays you listen to the music you go to a ball game and you got music that means the game is fixing to start we'll see the battle is on when you hear right Open the Eyes so you listen to the song and listen to the music and you'll understand what I mean the battle is on right because we're gonna hear and we want our eyes right right you know that's the reason okay the less thing is our brother comes to speak the word of the Lord unto it remember now April the 6th the uh Easter time down at the Gillsville Park and we'll be having our eats together time together and then have our Bible study on that Saturday first Saturday in April they start two o'clock we'll eat about five and then we'll get into our services about six and go to whatever okay and hopefully we can line up with that all right so let's just sing and welcome our brother to the pool Vietnam Open the Eyes of My Heart tomorrow foreign I trust that that's your desire yeah hey man you want to see him yeah amen more of him and less of you amen all right amen that's what I desire amen that's whatever you want of us amen as we're growing in him he's gonna be seeing less of us amen it's the other way around something didn't happen from the beginning you see yeah something happened right in your experience amen amen but if you're seeing more of him in your life amen that something's taking place I may love the Lord certainly a privilege and honor to be here behind this sacred desk and appreciate brother uh Dale right away uh and uh I feel uh I feel kind of lucky today I'm wearing a lucky shirt and lucky tie there was a little misunderstanding and I didn't come to to minister this weekend I came you know visit brother Wade and brother Joe and all them and they said well you're going to be preaching tomorrow he said what I can bring any preaching clothes on brother brother white said don't worry about that oh yeah we got a whole closet full of ties you just pick one yeah so all right but uh we just certainly thankful to be here yeah you know we might not have planned it but God certainly had it in his mind you're here because God put you here and he wanted you to be here this afternoon anyway we just thank God for that amen amen we're just gonna I'm just gonna take a little thought this afternoon and um um try to go through quickly maybe show a little bit of a uh just a few pictures of our missionary trip last year when we went to the Philippines so um I don't want to keep you all standing so let's go to the scriptures uh this afternoon to Colossians chapter 3 Colossians chapter 3 starting at verse one now they were mentioning this morning in in Sunday school a little a little thought about uh Living Dead and zombies and stuff and uh for the Way Broadway didn't know I had already preached the message about that before okay and so uh uh I just felt led to just go that that direction this afternoon so um uh just kind of type you know about how the world you know uh the the things that the world does you know they they do it for a purpose and you can almost type everything what they do with with spiritual you see so um let's just look at this this afternoon amen praise God Colossians chapter 3 start in verse one it says if ye then be risen with Christ seek those things which are above where Christ sitteth on the right hand of God set your affection on things above not on things on the earth for ye are dead and your life is hid with Christ in God right now it's interesting how Paul here talks about he's talking about life but yet he's talking about death at the same time right you see amen verse 4 when Christ who is our life shall appear amen then shall he also appear with him in glory mortified Therefore your members which are upon the Earth fornication and cleanliness inordinate affection evil concupiscence and covetousness which is idolatry for which things seek the wrath of God cometh on the children of disobedience in verse 7 into which he also walks sometime when ye lived in them praise God Amen let's just buy our heads precious Lord we thank you once again for your opportunity that you've given us to be in the house of God lord to worship you in spirit and in truth Lord and to Feast upon your word I pray that you'd open our ears of our understanding Lord let us father God receive something from you not from a man but Lord God let your Holy Spirit just come down amongst us let us leave here different than what we came in Father God pray that you'd use uh these frail lips Lord God and Lord may you be the the spokesperson this afternoon Lord we had Commit This Time into your hands now in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen amen okay so you may be seeing it tonight just working okay I like to certainly put a put a smile on your face hey man if you're here behind here preaching you know if you're all nervous you'll take that nervous that's nervousness amen praise God but you know you should be nervous whenever you're speaking to the bride of Christ right man praise the Lord so amen so this afternoon I just want to take this little thought Living Dead amen Living Dead I was going to call it the living dead but that might sound a little bit too impressive amen but you know in this on on Earth right now as though as the world as they're showing all these zombie movies and it seems like zombies were dead for a while and now they seem to be resurrected backed up again Hollywood seems to be resurrecting them backed up with shows uh the Living Dead and all these kinds of uh things but you know what they're presenting only what's in them you see right there's death that's working in them they're picking up images and things from the fourth dimension right bringing them on right and all they can do is just uh portray what they really are right see Hollywood is nothing but death you see that's all right there's nothing you know if you enjoy Hollywood yeah come on hey man it speaks about what's going on inside your life but Hollywood is nothing but portraying that so that's that's if they're dead they're gonna portray zombies they're gonna portray demons and all kinds of stuff like that now if you if you look here what Paul said here in verse one that if he be if he then be risen with Christ amen now but Paul is saying here is that at some point in time you were dead right exactly you see at some point in time you were dead and but until Christ came on the scene amen then you were living right I was dead in sin and trespasses as the Bible said you were too amen you see when I was out in the world doing the things of the world I was dead right I was living but yeah I was dead as the scripture says amen but now you are risen with Christ amen so we know there's no Death Around Christ right there's no death within him outside that God is life amen amen so you're gonna have to portray life amen praise God if you're risen with Christ Jesus that's right now Ephesians 2 1 tells us and you have he quickened who were dead in trespasses and sins right man I mean it used to be dead yeah I used to be better that's why I always say I always thank God for his mercy and Grace Amen in all his mercy and Grace I would be where I am now amen right and you wouldn't be where you are now yeah praise God and I will never stop thanking him for his mercy and Grace amen now verse 2 tells us and there in Colossians chapter 3 continue reading well let's go back to verse one it says if ye then be risen with Christ seek those things which are above right amen where Christ sitted on the right hand of God right all right set your affection on things above all right what is it what is he talking about in other words set what's more important the things down here below are the things that are above you see whatever you love whatever you desire amen that's your affection you see you have an affection I have an affection for my wife right you see that's right and whatever you love that's what you desire right see so he's telling us Paul's telling here set your affection on things above not on things of the earth why because the things of the earth they're gonna perish amen Heaven's a nurse shall pass away but my word shall never pass away amen of the Christian desires to be more like Christ a Christian desires to feed on the word a Christian desires Amen to just grow up more in Christ amen looking up because our Redemption is drawn nice see but if you're constantly looking and watching zombie movies and constantly playing these zombie video games and constantly doing all these things you're looking down and you're not looking about it that's not going to help you getting a rap amen you see there's certain things that a Christian feeds upon right amen a Christian has a diet right the world has a doctor a patient has a doctor and it's not the same diet amen right bro now let's continue reading here in Colossians just kind of breaking these down verse two set your affection on things above not on things on the earth for ye are dead yep right amen and your life is hid with Christ in God Amen your life should be so hidden Christ that Satan won't even know where you're at right that's how head you should be in Christ right amen praise God whenever whenever you step foot every morning you get up amen Satan should be shivering amen right this he's gonna wake up again yeah yeah she's gonna wake up again she's gonna ruin my my ministry right yeah yeah right right that's it see Satan Satan watches each and every one of us and we can give Satan a hard time amen Jesus did and the only thing that he used was the word amen amen and he used none of his own tactics nothing nothing of the flesh that means the word back to the word amen that's what a Christian wants right that's the only way we can defeat Satan right amen verse 4 when Christ is our life shall appear then shall ye also appear with him in the Lord verse 5 mortified Therefore your members which are upon the Earth right amen and it lists all these different things in order to fiction evil concupiscence which are evil thoughts King covetousness which is idolatry amen so these are things amen that a Christian should be dead to amen amen you see a Christian is really the Living Dead yeah because we should be living dead right amen you see what I'm saying you see the world what is what is taken they're showing us the zombies resurrecting and what Satan is trying to do is he's perverted what he's doing is uh for example I I was in 80s and 90s kid and I grew up with Michael Jackson and all that stuff yeah now how many everyone remember Thriller yeah yeah Thriller if you ever saw the video what Thriller was is that all these zombies got up out of the grave and they started just dancing there in the Middle Street with Michael Jackson and everything I'm doing all these different dances and stuff but you see all it has is just a perversion of what happened in the upper room that's right right because when Christ when Christ uh resurrected he didn't come to bite people's heads off or nothing like that he came to give the Holy Ghost which is life he breathed on them to give him the Holy Ghost and then when they went back to the upper room they had a little dance themselves as well a little dance in the spirit right amen all right man and so all of Satan is is trying to pervert all that amen and bringing it bringing it down and people identify with those things and the more you identify with the more you're dying right I see right the more you're done right amen now as we said you know each and every one of us we're walking dead amen before Christ came and touched your life yeah right each and every one of us have walked dead and you know we can bring in we can bring it down home no just because you've been in the message 20 30 40 years don't mean that you can't be walking around dead right right 30 40 years in the message don't mean anything to God that's right amen amen amen is it the message is in you all right the message isn't you then you'll be living amen all right some of us come to church dragging our feet you know what brother Dale's gonna preach tonight yeah yeah all right let's see what brother dick is gonna watch songs he's gonna be singing yeah let's see what uh what they're gonna give me you know it's almost like people come to church with some of them some of them come to church with with bibs on yeah yeah and then there's some that come with aprons on you know yeah and then the ones that come with bibs on are the ones usually that kind of sit back there in the corner and just kind of let's say give me give him yeah all right kind of getting dirty kind of getting you know just kind of letting drip off you know and but the ones that are that they're ready to come you know not just to be served but to serve amen they got their ready they're ready to serve amen ready to work right amen praise God now as I said you know the world's been repopulated they were popularized zombies amen through Hollywood and art and we see it all all the time man everywhere we're seeing uh the zombies are coming back to life all right amen and you know what a zombie it doesn't it doesn't care what what uh uh uh doesn't care uh where it goes you know it just walks and you can kind of push it this way and then it goes this way you know and they're ready to they got this evil evil thing too they're ready to bite your head off if you're not careful you know and I actually looked up the word zombie in the dictionary and uh here's what the word zombie means the body of a dead person given the semblance of Life all right but mute and Willis by Supernatural Force yeah usually for some evil purpose right see it's a person it's a it's a it's a being that's walking living you see but they're living a perverted life right they're walking dead right you see they're The Walking Dead it's a person whose Behavior or responses are wooden listless or seemingly roped in other words there's an automation going on there yeah so I hope none of us none of us are seemingly wooden right you see you see because it's very easy as Christians to take everything as a routine that's right oh yeah and we get so comfortable with the routine and if it doesn't happen like this then I'm completely uh I go overboard you see it's a routine don't get me wrong there's got to be order you see her absolutely but God look what happened to Gideon in the Bible he was he was stuck in a routine in his life until God completely changing and said look you're a man you're you're a man uh uh uh uh um what is it I need I need you right I'm Gonna Get You Out of My out of your comfort zone because I gotta use you you see right and that's that's how God always does you see God doesn't want us to always be stuck in the routine because we get comfortable in the routine then we forget right what what else doctors do around us routine and I actually heard the other day brother Brown kind of paraphrasing I was listening brother Brandon said routines can be detrimental to a Christian if you're not careful wherever right right so you have to you there's got to be orders right right but if you're not careful because God sometimes gets us out of our comfort zone all right buddy that's what he specializes amen praise God you don't want us to be in zombie mode coming in here with zombie mode you see brother Dale can't help you if you're coming in here in zombie mode you see where the weight can't help you to come in here and zombie mod amen the whole that we can we can easily quench the spirit if we come again zombies they're ready to pull on the word you're right what what God feed me feed my soul I'm here to hear more of you amen praise God I'm here to receive from you from you man amen praise God now as we see as we were talking about Satan what he's trying to do with these zombies is he's just trying to pervert show a perversion of life and Resurrection right and man what Satan is doing is he's actually laughing at the world as he's showing them on a TV screen you see there there uh yeah and the TV screen showing them who they really are and they can't seem to pick it up right that's that's them you see and and uh uh um it's almost like what Revelations 3 tells us if in Revelation 3 when he was talking about in the The Churchill to see him he says because thou says I am rich and increase with good and have need of nothing notice that thou art wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked the world is poor blind naked and they don't even know it right all right brother amen yeah they're in zombie mode they don't even know it right right that's right they're so stuck with American Idol and they're so stuck with all these Legacy with the Stars and all these different shows and all these different things Hollywood is just constantly bombarded and they just uh right yeah and then there's a little thing going on here this TV show comes on uh another TV show and it's just constantly that's how the world is you go out to the mall and you go to the mountain you look at people's faces exactly the young people today sure there's no life in them it seems like there's a force that's controlled but you see the bride of Christ has life amen amen right that's right the bride of Christ should be different that's the reason why we're separating people amen because there's life dwelling within us right right it's done how many of y'all heard that case of in Miami that took place last year about the uh the Apocalyptic Zombie it was last year last May and uh there was a there was a man who was on there these bath salts and bath salts what it is is uh it's a it's a code word for these drugs and they they mix together or this particular person was under these these uh uh these bath salts and he got apparently these bath salts what they do to your bodies they make you really warm From the Inside Out make you really hot the man was on these things and he got really hot and so he started stripping his clothes off and he was naked in the middle of Miami nice to know he finds this man this this homeless man and he starts beating this man starts tearing his clothes off and you can you can see what kind of spirit he was on a demonic Spirit right starts beating the man and then finally somebody calls the cops and they actually caught it on surveillance camera and you can actually see it if you could go to the internet you can actually see it but um uh the the when the police came they tried to tell the man this you know try to try to get him off and the man was so I mean it was demons he actually snarled at the cop like that and the cop they couldn't stop him so they finally they had to shoot him down right and they and it took five shots to to completely kill them right and what the man was doing actually to this homeless man was he was actually he had knocked them down hurt him really bad and what he was doing he was actually biting his face off with his physical teeth he was not biting his face off he completely disfigured this man's face that he had to have reconstructive surgery he lived but he had to have reconstructive surgery wow now you see I tell that the example because to show you the world one zombies they got zombies yeah that's right see they got a zombie and that's not the only case right there's cases multiple cases around the United States of people literally flesh eating eating humans you usually hear uh things like that down in the jungles of Venezuela in Africa or something like that but it's actually taking place among civilizations you see yeah there's nothing but demons there's nothing but the spirit of the age you see right that's the reason why let's take a look and see is what what are these zombies why is the world portraying zombies because the world is constantly just want to portray death that and pushing death death to our and and if you're not careful you can be identified with these things you see it on young people's coats and they have skulls all over them and all kinds of stuff you see it's just a tongue culture of death right as we read they they were also like the Sardis age where they had a name that they lived but were dead right amen and you can read that in Revelations 3 1. amen now I'm trying to move a little quickly here now there in verse one in Colossians where we were reading Colossians 3 verse one it says if you then be risen with Christ seek those things which are above where Christ sitteth on the right hand of God Amen so you were risen a man with Christ amen believer it should be risen in Christ all right but then in verse 3 it tells us that ye are dead right right yeah amen for ye are dead and your life is hid with Christ and God and you're wondering okay Paul's sitting here I'm living in Christ but then he sent me I'm dead right see what is he talking about you see right Amen in verse three it continues to say that your life is hid with Christ in God amen amen and your life has to be hidden in Christ in order for you to be dead into yourself amen right it has to be amen right there's no other way amen as Paul said it also in Romans 8 uh Romans 8 verse 8 through 10 says so then that they uh then they they are in the flesh cannot please God right exactly but ye are not in the flesh right but in the spirit right if so the spirit of God dwelled in you you're right amen so you're not in the flesh right but you're even though you are all right but you're not in the flesh right see exactly shouldn't be living in the flesh amen and you shouldn't and when a Christian should if he fall Falls flat on his face amen he should have remorse for that and quickly repent right you see amen now Christian will really do that right amen but if you sit there water in your mud puddle and you don't want to get up amen right something's wrong with your experience amen right you see now if any uh if any man have not the spirit of Christ he is none of his right right I don't even have to explain that that's what makes plain in verse 10 and if Christ being you the body is dead right right all right man are you supposed to have life right right yeah right the body is dead because of sin right but the spirit is life because of righteousness amen how many believe he's our righteousness your afternoon amen so the true Christian as I said the true Christian is truly the living dead right you should be the you are the true Living Dead yeah right Living Dead to yourself right don't give me a run you're not zombies but you're the true as you're growing in Christ you should be dying more to yourself right amen because you're living in him you should be dying as well you see there's no dying going on there's no going up right amen there's got to be dying to take place in your life you see what I'm saying all right amen because you see he's dead the Christian's dead to himself and yet he has life dwelling in him by the spirit amen right amen that's the reason why we have to mortify the Deeds of the flesh right right amen Romans 8 12 tells us therefore brethren we are debtors not to the flesh right to live after the flesh right we don't owe the flesh anything in other words that's right there's nothing that the flesh wants to rise up in your life you don't owe nothing to that flesh because that flesh is going to perish amen right of course one day you know that it'll be resurrected in a glorified body right absolutely but I like what brother Wade was talking about this morning at Sunday school he said this this this body is not is not uh it's not coming in the word birth you see what I'm saying right it's perversion the way we can in this life you see but one day we will have a glorified body amen yes sir praise God Colossians 3 5 tells us mortified Therefore your members which are upon the Earth right amen so Paul here is making it clear amen but the only way you can do that is if the spirit of Christ is living in you that's right right now I know this sounds very simple this afternoon but you see sometimes we get away from Simplicity yeah we get carried away with the Deep things I said and then we forget about the simple things and it helps us to live in Christ amen but so uh the only way amen a Christian should be different from the world Amen that's right a man of Christians should not be in zombie mode constantly that's right like a lead that's right you know like Paul said from one Doctrine to the other right going back and forth the third Testament here over here and the uh what is it the two Soul Doctrine over here in the Perugia over here on the tent over here yeah a lot of Christians live that way they sure are because this brother sounds good and this brother sounds inspiring you know so I'm gonna grow grapple what he's yeah and this other brother Rises up and oh he sounds much better you got the people shouting he got them go over here see yeah right they're walking one way you see they're looking wrong way and then you push them over and then they turn over and you see and they're walking the other way yeah what a zombie is Right a message zombie to me amen so in order to keep living you must be dying hey man that's right praise God yeah amen now there's there's a there's a um there's a process in the human body that's actually you know that our cells uh they have to live and they live and die right right another forever you can't be you can't be who you are and you can't be living if you didn't have cells that were living and dying right see exactly right and that process is called apoptosis or apoptysis I can't remember exactly how you say it but and it's what it is is it keeps the human body in its constant form see yeah because for example the cells between our fingers right if the sales that were growing there if if we didn't if we didn't uh if they didn't die we would actually have overgrowth in our body right see yep we would have over good that's the reason why there's tumors that's the reason why there's cancer and all these different things I mean we know that demons are also absolutely amen amen but now if there's a a different process that if too many cells die at once that's called the necrosis and that's where where it's a form of traumatic cell death right and that's when the body actually ends up with deformities in the body or things like that you see amen so um spiritual apoptosis is what we need in the right yeah amen you have to constantly be living and die right you see as you're living you're done you see what I'm saying but we need is spiritual uptosis in our life amen amen and it's amazing how God you know he does that in the natural right yeah and that's what's Paul's talking about you see we can do it in the spiritual as well right now you have to live you you have to live and the other way to live you have to be dying at the same time that's the only way that a human body can continue growing you see exactly there's got to be cells to die in order for new ones to come up right amen right so a spiritual optosis has to be in place in a Christian's life amen there has to be a constant dying of self amen flesh amen get it out of the way right in order for you to keep spiritually living in Christ Jesus right right amen praise God and now on the uh on the other hand if there's too many cells dying at once yeah man you could hurt yourself as well right it's almost like as if you know if new people come to the church and some of us say well you know Sister hasn't gotten the Revelation about letting her hair grow out yeah some of her sister would just just I don't know when you're gonna let your hair grow out yeah and we were just we just you know we we can't rush certainly you know it's an individual walk of Christ you can't get everybody everything at once because you didn't grow up that way you see and if and if we're not careful if you if you're trying to put too much dying on them you know spiritual you can call spiritual necrosis on the body you see amen and the body won't be able to grow right right see right and there'll be deformities in the Bible right we can't force people into this you see right you can't give people the Holy Ghost it's got to be God to do the work amen that's right if God doesn't do the work brother Dale was the one that did the work yeah then some other brother over here get them pretty pretty easy right but if God did the work amen amen then then they have a foundation they're firming with anybody no matter what happens around them no matter what goes on no matter what what what kind of doctors come in amen they're standing firm on the word right amen amen and the word is the Holy Ghost that's right amen praise God all right brother Brown said I believe brother Brown said you know they want him over where the hot dog supper right yeah and then over here they they went over with a pizza or something oh yeah that's right that's how you go back and forth you know amen so you can't rush anyone's spiritual life amen that's right amen that's what that's the reason why we have to walk in the spirit amen amen Galatians 5 you uh tells us uh let's turn that real quick um because you know you know that zombies uh zombies are the world they all when we were dead we were also walking in the spirit as well yeah yeah the Bible says that we were walking the despair to the power in the area right amen right so the world they walking in the spirit as well amen Ephesians 2 2 where it says Where in the town passed you walked according to the course of this world according to the prince of the power of the Earth the spirit that now worketh and the children of Disobedience right right they're walking in the spirits right right amen but the wrong Spirit right amen now and and we read their in Galatians 5 it says for Brethren ye have been called unto Liberty only use not Liberty for an occasion to the flesh but by love serve one another amen amen in other words you come and then you have your apron on right right amen amen for all the law is fulfilled in one word even in this Thou shalt love thy right neighbor as thyself right but if ye bite and devour one another take heed that ye be not consumed one another right right amen and we get into spiritual zombie mode amen it's very easy to bite and devour one another right amen right that's what a zombie does goes around biting people's necks going around biting people's arms and and and if you're not careful if the Holy Ghost is not we're dealing in your life amen yeah very easy to be backbiting one another right oh yeah man gossip all over the church and all all that right it's very easy amen Satan Creeps in in that way right if you're if you're if you're not in zombie mode and you don't have to worry about it right yeah right yeah right right amen and in verse 16 verse 16 look what it tells us there in Galatians 5 because this is the way we avoid biting an Environ one another right this I say then walk in the spirit and you shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh amen all right so the brother brother come see you say hey pray for such and such brother uh uh and you know that's their excuse to kind of trying to tell you a little gossip you know pray for brothers such and such prayer says oh really what happened let me tell you sister yeah let me tell you what happened all right yeah you have you have the power to stop that right there right right bro how'd your fishing trip go last week yeah um yeah all right completely quenches that spirit and Satan's like oh yeah I almost had it right all right let me go to Sister sus and such over here I know I know she's she let me try over here again yeah right praise God brother uh Joe if you want to bring up that quote real quick amen a little quote here rebound says and David screamed out oh that loving kindness is better to me than life now life everyone wants to think of life and the word life has had a perverted aspect to it because that even life itself has a perverted aspect many times people want to refer to life as having a big time drinking rallying and going out they say this is life how mistaken they are that's death right Miranda says see it's not life it's death right and then a few weeks ago we're in a great famous hotel in Canada where they put me up I went up to my room after my service and there was a young lady perhaps in their late teens 18 19 maybe up to 23 somewhere three or four of them running up and down the floor with just their underneath garments on them and with bottles in their hands running from one room to the other lovely looking young women yeah they got this movie out now uh it's called I think it's called Spring Break and it's exactly they portraying women exactly like brother Brandon talking about here right now around in their underneath garments with drinking bottles of beer and all kinds of stuff as I got off the elevator I stood and looked oh there was something in me I thought oh god well my little Rebecca or Sarah ever come to that and I looked at them they staggered across the floor I just stepped into one side till they passed and walked on out went the other way drinking and I stopped at the end of the hall and looked down again seen lovely ladies which could probably be a real sweetheart to some men and I heard one of them say whoopee this is life yeah and I thought how wrong that is that's death for the Bible says she that liveth and pleasure is dead while she is alive so then we find out that life what we call life then we sign we see signs today such as this where there is Budweiser there's life our perverted that is where there's Budweiser there's death right yeah and we see signs like this too life begins when the Sun goes down no death begins when the Sun goes down the people become night Prowlers they prowl at night and if you notice they take the nature of the evil evil always cries at night in a zombie movies is usually the the zombies are walking around at night amen and I read in an article in magazine one time when I was on an airplane it was about Hollywood and it said that life begins after midnight you should come down on certain streets and certain things and they had the picture of burlesque and so forth that goes on and I said how perverted that is you see if Satan has a kingdom he's got to have a false economy right brother Bob speaking about the economy this morning he's got to have something that he can present to them to make them think they are living right you see but it's absolutely on the vice versa side it's death in the form of life it's a perversion from real life amen and then he said let us settle this and our minds now once and forever there's only one way to have life that's right and to know him is life that's the only way that we can have life and no other way for God has only promised life for Jesus Christ amen amen so you see oh Living Dead and all these zombie things it's only Satan amen trying to fool the world right because Satan can only pervert Yeah you see right but see we have true life we have money why do you want to settle for something fake when you can have them Jesus Christ is the real answer yes praise God so we just thank God how many want to be living dead to yourself right that's right I'm gonna live more dead than that to myself right now so that he can have the preeminence in my life amen praise the Lord Jesus that's right Amen brother uh brother Joe I don't know if you were able to get the PowerPoint presentation up hey man just a little thought this this afternoon and uh um as you all uh some of y'all will know um Tuesday will be uh heading to the Philippines um I was invited to preach a uh uh the youth camp this year there uh or be one of the speakers there and uh so we'll be heading that's coming up next Wednesday is when it's going to start and uh um certainly it's a privilege and you know you kind of get kind of nervous because they're expecting to be over 500 youth just youth there right last year there was about 800 wow so um but Lord Weldon we're going to minister that and I also like to be able to swing to Hong Kong China and there's a little work that's going on there and hopefully help those those brothers and sisters there amen um so we're kind of trying to decide I go there and you're kind of at the mercy of the brothers and brothers there you see when they take you wherever wherever they you know and you're only going to be aware where God wants you to be I see so anyway uh we're going to be with one of the royal Soriano most of the time of course y'all remember brother Royal um this is my wife's cousin so when I married Christine I kind of got been into the family you know and but it's been a blessing because it's open doors right but God knows God knows what he's doing amen but uh brother Dale he knows it's the Filipino people they're very humble they're very they're very nice they're very uh and they love the word Amanda amen but last year we had the opportunity to go in January and I just wanted to show you a little a few pictures I was able to stir around the islands about 10 we Minister about seven services in 10 days and uh and that was you know one run right after the other so needless to say I was pretty tired and uh so go ahead brother Joe we'll pull in uh I mean of course he uses some facts you know the Philippine Islands uh they have over 7 000 Islands uh uh and uh capital is Manila uh Lord Whelan uh we want to try to head down here to uh Palawan there's some works that are starting to uh take up uh starting over there brother Royal he's working really heavily in that area manila's over here so that's where brother Morel lives brother Danny del mundo and some of these other brothers that um and so he constantly goes down here and of course minda now down there real dangerous area so uh they haven't taken us there because it's real dangerous and you have a lot of rebels there a lot of Guerrilla warfare that takes place there of course you got a lot of Muslims um the total population of the entire Philippines as of 2010 is over 93 million people so there's still a lot of work to do right amen right go ahead brother um when we were there last year go ahead and hit next brother Joe we were we traveled from Manila um Friday January 13th and we went up to together get out and then from there Hey Brother Jeff uh we went to lingayan this is the area you didn't know this is the area where um General McArthur stood and said uh I shall return yeah I was actually actually stood in that beach where he actually pulled in and it's kind of interesting so it's a real that area over there is really uh they have a lot of World War II artifacts and things like that there and after that we ministered uh uh there um we headed back to uh to Manila go ahead brother Jeff well well over there they took me to this cave um and uh it's one of those cave with like Limestone formations and all kinds of stuff and uh it's really pretty and it's called the kalau caves and uh there's brother Soriano this is Pastor Rafi uh he's a pastor there now amen this is a video there the kalal caves I don't know if you can play just a little small snippet of that or not I don't think it'll play you can just hit go to the next okay there you go there's some uh audio that goes along with it but okay the brother uh he just got he was about to get married the next day and uh he was being our tour guide and the next day he was getting ready to get married so uh they were very real serviceable you know they'll get out of the way to just you know good um okay brother Joe you can stop it all right uh we had a that day we had lunch and ministers meeting uh and and this is which was up north where we went up uh we went there by airplane it was about an hour uh airplane ride from Manila um we had lunch with them they actually served me uh something that they call Papa Eaton and they said hey you've heard of papayita and papa Eaton what it is it's uh it's usually goat contestants what they do is they put them in a soup and then what they take is divide the vial and they put squirt it inside the soup so you're eating a bitter soup and sometimes in some other areas what brother Soriano's told me is that they'd actually take the like in the intestines there's still grass and stuff that the goats have eaten nope pour that in there as well so uh I had some of that but this time wasn't go uh it was carabao and carabao is a form it's like a it's a type of a cattle that they have there and uh but it still is better and uh definitely they had some lemons here somewhere I squirted a bunch of lemon juice in there and uh some bananas with it yeah and they said they said oh you wanted to try Papa Ethan and I ended up eating Papa Eating three times that day because they thought they thought you know I just really you know it was okay but that's about that's enough for me foreign there and uh just had a really good time you know with the with the brothers there and just some of the ministers he's a pastor as well most of most of the brothers here are are pastors he's a pastor there in the local area in that same area so we're just having a good time in the Lord go ahead brother Johnny depression all right so that night we ministered uh in andarayan which is there in tubegra and uh um we Minister that brother Pastor Jaime tambawan which is the brother right here and um and we had a really good Timbre of the world was interpreted for me because even though a lot of people there in the Philippines they speak English and they understand it but some of them especially the older ones they they still they only speak Tagalog and so they still have a hard time but the English language but for the most part you can Minister over there and you don't need an interpreter so go ahead and there here's a little clip there from that I don't know if that plays or not he'll clip there from that service the sister right here uh she was Raising her hands she's the pastor's uh daughter I mean not daughter but the pastor's sister and uh she's got a powerful testimony because uh he was Secure uh yeah I believe she had cancer in the brain she fell or something like that and uh she's perfectly normal today is that praising the Lord and she wanted to sing and she's always constantly singing and she came back she she asked me she's like can uh she said uh they don't have they don't have drum set instruments or anything like that she requested she said because she loves music she's like maybe we could get a set of drums and uh but uh these the you see the instruments there because they were actually borrowed from another church so all right you can pause and uh from there we took a tricycle ride over to pangasinang where were the uh the beach there in uh where General MacArthur we ministered there they had a a a a church service um uh an anniversary there at one of the churches there and uh we left the area where we me and brother Royal were sleeping at and they took us in a tricycle ride it's a very popular uh form of transportation in the Philippines and so I got on there it was my first time riding on a tricycle so I had to take a little video so go ahead brother real so you just kind of I mean brother Joe

they live right there next to the ocean there's a beach there there's a little boy who actually got swept away by the Sea and they were looking for him for two hours and they couldn't find where he

right she stepped out walked out on the on the shore and she the brother brother Royal was there this was a this was about 10 years ago where the Royal was there preaching at that church there at that that day and he had just spoken about speak to this mountain you see and he said uh uh she got she got inspiration from that and went up walked over to the shore and she called To The Shore and she said bring the boy back and he said a couple of minutes later the boy was washed up washed up in the shore the boy was okay and they asked him what happened what happened he said I don't know I was asleep the whole time yeah you explained that to me he was asleep the whole time he said and the boys you can speak now just to the mountain but you speak to the ocean amen praise God all right next

has done amen amen so amen that's for the role of his family and I guess as I'm part of the family too I'm in it as well that's it so things I just ask that you all I apologize for taking too much time but I just ask that you all uh remember us in prayer uh this this uh this coming Tuesday will be there for two weeks and my family was not going to be it's not going to be able to go with us this time around so uh uh I hate that but God knows all things I know so uh may God bless you all um stand to our feet this afternoon and I'm asking musicians to come let's just have a word of Prayer you know we're not here to promote any church we're not here to promote anything we're just here to promote the work of Christ amen and I know that you all are mission-minded and so that's why you know uh everyone don't share these things with you all amen um because price that was the Commandment of the Lord amen for you to all the world and preach the gospel and not just you don't have to be you don't have to be going to the Philippines or Venezuela or wherever the priests are you can do it low price you can bring it to your neighbor amen by the way you live your life right imagine that's the best way live me a sermon let's just buy our heads precious Lord as we come before you once again we thank you Father that your word has gone forth Lord we asked father God that it may rest upon each one every heart Lord God and that they may be able to uh uh receive father God benefit from it Lord God let it change let your word changes from the inside out Lord Jesus we love you father God we commit this uh the rest of this afternoon into your hands protect your people as they're heading back to their respective places Lord God and Lord may you just bless this church Lord blessed brother Dale brother Wade and father in their efforts here Lord God and dealing with your people here on this part of the world Lord Jesus we love you we commit ourselves into your hands now father and ask you these things in the name of Lord Jesus Christ amen God bless you thanks brother amen amen enjoy the message foreign foreign hear me foreign baby baby really nice or Jesus foreign probably wonder why when we're praying for somebody that while we keep singing the same verse over and over see if you stop the music and start changing things you can kill the spirit that's right A lot of people don't realize that you can kill it you can stop it you can change the people because no matter what you're doing being prayed for if that music changes if you're gonna your brain goes working differently yeah until we just or ministers and music and all are instructed to keep singing the same song as long as we're praying for people because that way at least you can say well they may have sung that over 20 times but if it keeps on going we're saying 50 times the worries but I'd rather do that than to stop and start another song and you're going to kill things tell brother Louise how much you appreciate him and the Lord will bless him we'll learn the Philippines and all the Lord and you know Lord be with him it's a like he said they are good people they're they're really friendly and really nice to you you know and everything and it's a good group of people to go visit so you know you ever get a chance go over there or anything be good but just tell him how much you appreciate I appreciate everybody and let's just pray and be dismissed and father we thank you Lord for this day our brothers are ministering unto us Lord and that's just having a little time to relax and not have to be worried about having to preacher because it's not a burden but it is hard on the body sometimes and hard on us and we just ask you to help us and guide us down bless brother Lou he says he goes and giving him safety as he travels Lord quite a distance to Flying and be in our Lord and just help him and be with him during his time there give him a safe journey let all your loving grace be with each you never wanted we're on our way home take care of everybody we love you and we thank you in Jesus name amen amen and Elijah foreign hell
