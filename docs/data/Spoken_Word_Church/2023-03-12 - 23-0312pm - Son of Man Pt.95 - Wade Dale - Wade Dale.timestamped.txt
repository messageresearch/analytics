[16:08] adjust the temperature but you can turn
[16:10] that on if you want to I appreciate that
[16:12] uh good to be back in the house of the
[16:14] Lord uh you know we were talking about
[16:17] electricity today right before we closed
[16:20] and I knew I I had
[16:24] I knew that Elisha brother Elisha Negron
[16:26] from from Ohio he's a master electorate
[16:29] I mean he he deals with
[16:32] hundreds of thousands of bolts in in a
[16:35] Factory sitting
[16:37] setting
[16:39] so
[16:41] he sent me a note by he sent me a a uh
[16:44] Marco Polo a few minutes ago and he said
[16:46] he said well he said this is the way to
[16:48] look at it he said you got all that
[16:51] voltage he said now 120 volts
[16:54] will shake you
[16:57] he said how many people were in the
[16:58] upper room
[17:04] now he give this a night because I
[17:06] thought it was 240 but he said it's
[17:08] actually 277 volts we'll grab you and
[17:11] hold you
[17:13] he said 480 volts he said there's your
[17:16] body change
[17:17] [Laughter]
[17:21] 480 it will blow you out of your socks
[17:24] and change your body it'll put you in a
[17:27] different place
[17:28] but praise God for that we maybe we need
[17:31] some voltage going on you know a little
[17:32] bit of power
[17:35] and like yeah this
[17:38] it's a Dark Age dark hour though man you
[17:41] go you know tomorrow we're going to
[17:42] leave we'll go out in in the world and
[17:44] and Monday and Michael's got a new job
[17:47] with Amazon so pray for him
[17:50] see how they grown and moan when you say
[17:52] that
[17:56] and you know you don't deliver the
[17:59] package right
[18:01] yeah
[18:03] she better do it right the first time
[18:06] but I'm glad for all these younger folks
[18:08] that are getting jobs
[18:10] I tell um
[18:12] when I go to the cafe every morning for
[18:14] breakfast before I walk down to my first
[18:16] job
[18:17] at the post office they said where you
[18:18] going I said I'm going to work so you
[18:20] don't have to
[18:23] they said you just keep paying them
[18:24] taxes keep that check coming every month
[18:27] so
[18:28] but that's the cycle of everything going
[18:30] we see the cycle even here in in the
[18:33] church you know by the collie brother
[18:34] dirty they used to be the young ones
[18:37] now they're the older ones
[18:39] some of us used to be the younger ones
[18:40] now we're the older ones but we got a
[18:42] group of younger ones that are coming up
[18:43] that are that are really really uh to me
[18:47] they're outpacing a lot of us and I say
[18:49] us as far as wanting to be involved and
[18:55] to hear the word of God and be the word
[18:57] of God but that's the way it's supposed
[18:59] to be and that plan that God had he
[19:01] didn't the only time God had that plan
[19:03] to end was when the Rapture takes place
[19:06] and it doesn't matter then everybody's
[19:07] you know you're you're either staying
[19:09] here or you're leaving one of the two so
[19:11] there is a plan within with an N but but
[19:14] what does that end do that end just puts
[19:17] us into eternity where there is no
[19:19] beginning or no end so it's not an end
[19:21] like the end of life is coming it's an
[19:23] end
[19:25] of this that we see here now and it
[19:28] takes us
[19:29] into a Rapture and that's what we're
[19:31] looking at it's what we're looking for
[19:33] um
[19:34] uh brother Aaron will be doing Wednesday

[22:13] about today
[22:14] all the pieces that are missing in God's
[22:16] economy they will be filled
[22:18] because God's not going to have part
[22:20] plan
[22:21] he had a plan the plan is going to be
[22:22] fulfilled and every person that's in
[22:24] that plan is going to be in there you
[22:25] just got to make sure you
[22:27] know that you know that you know that
[22:30] you're fulfilling you're part of the
[22:31] plan all right instead of just we don't
[22:33] as Christians I was thinking the other
[22:35] day would uh we look at people and
[22:38] I know you do and you know people that
[22:42] that they just have no aim or no purpose
[22:43] in life
[22:44] don't know where they're going that's
[22:46] why they resort to alcohol drugs and all
[22:48] the different things is because they're
[22:50] fulfilling a desire to do something for
[22:53] a god
[22:55] right whatever you want to call it
[22:58] but listen we have a plan regardless of
[23:00] God we know the god
[23:02] oh that that has a plan and a purpose
[23:04] for us we just got to plug ourselves
[23:06] like I said this morning you gotta plug
[23:07] yourself into that
[23:09] and then say God what is it for me and
[23:11] then if it ain't if it's something you
[23:12] don't like you got to say hey
[23:14] listen Jesus did something he didn't
[23:16] like either
[23:18] he said father may this cup pass from me
[23:21] but nevertheless not my will but thy
[23:24] will be done sometimes we we sometimes
[23:27] we want to go this way and and we hit a
[23:29] snag or we hit a door or we hit
[23:31] something
[23:32] well God wants you to go in another
[23:34] Direction all right remember God's knows
[23:36] are the best yeses you'll ever have
[23:38] because he knows if he lets you go down
[23:40] and he'll let you go down that path
[23:42] he'll let you go down through there if
[23:44] you really really want to but boy you're
[23:46] going to really really mess up
[23:48] so I mess up enough I don't want to mess
[23:50] up intentionally I want the will of the
[23:53] Lord and that's what we need to
[23:55] pray for here is the will of the Lord
[23:56] for everything that we do all these
[23:58] brothers that we're bringing in and all
[24:00] these Services we have and the stuff
[24:01] we're doing for the Youth and stuff
[24:03] we're doing for each and every one we
[24:05] pray that we're building onto building
[24:08] on that and we're helping each other
[24:11] find your piece of the puzzle find your
[24:13] peace and your place to be so when we
[24:16] realize who we are what we're doing here
[24:17] will be an invincible Army I want to be
[24:19] an invincible Army I don't want to be
[24:20] something that the devil just beats me
[24:22] around all over the place all right amen
[24:26] think about that wouldn't that be
[24:28] wonderful you said well it will be when
[24:29] we get on the other side I think brother
[24:31] Brown said we're gonna have it on this
[24:32] side or we won't get it on the other
[24:33] side
[24:34] they won't be another side there'll be
[24:36] another side but it won't be the side
[24:38] you want to go to so let's make our
[24:40] decision here
[24:42] and know that we know that we know we
[24:44] know this is the correct message of the
[24:46] hour we know that it's it's it's it's
[24:47] that's what's going to change our body
[24:49] is the is the revelation of the message
[24:51] of the hour so let's just dig into that
[24:54] so let's bow our heads Lord thank you
[24:56] for this afternoon
[24:57] we appreciate you for all the good
[24:59] things that you've given us and as we
[25:01] sing songs Lord is just what a mighty
[25:04] God what a what a wonderful wonderful
[25:07] thing that that we have
[25:09] called the new birth
[25:11] it's you made manifest in another form
[25:15] called a bride and we are individuals
[25:17] but yet we're one unit Lord working
[25:19] together my finger is not the same as my
[25:23] toe but it has it's attached to the same
[25:25] body
[25:25] and it has a function to to keep my body
[25:29] going Lord so I pray Lord that the body
[25:31] of Christ will continue to build and
[25:34] keep going Lord in the admonition of the
[25:36] Lord and not in the world not look like
[25:38] the world not act like the world not be
[25:40] like the world but Lord would be more
[25:42] like you you gave us that promise
[25:44] you gave us an unconditional Covenant
[25:48] that you were going to have a bride and
[25:51] you were going to see this to the end
[25:53] and you
[25:55] know who's going to make it and who's
[25:57] not but we don't Lord
[25:58] but you're going to reveal to us I
[26:00] believe you revealed to each person in a
[26:03] part of their life what they're doing
[26:04] here and what their purpose is so I pray
[26:07] that that will be unfolded Lord and
[26:09] reveal to each and every one of us
[26:11] Lord I pray that you should be with ones
[26:14] that are sick the ones that are not with
[26:15] us
[26:16] the ones Lord that are sin sick father
[26:18] the ones that you know in and out of
[26:20] church and disappear and appear and and
[26:23] Lord just have all kind of issues and
[26:25] problems
[26:26] Lord may they find you may they find the
[26:30] Pavilion that they're supposed to get in
[26:32] and hide which is you
[26:34] father just be with us in a further
[26:36] minute service in Jesus name we pray
[26:38] amen it's not a man was on part 95. in
[26:42] the beginning was the word the word was
[26:44] with God and the Word was God
[26:46] and that word was made flesh and dwelt
[26:48] among us and we beheld his glory the
[26:50] glory of the only begotten of the father
[26:52] full of grace and truth
[26:54] second Peter 1 says and besides this
[26:56] giving all diligence add to your faith
[26:58] now we've come to the place that we're
[27:00] adding to your faith now
[27:02] virtue and to Virtue knowledge into
[27:04] knowledge Temperance the temperance
[27:06] patience the patience and godliness
[27:09] and we'll get to it today just have
[27:11] patience but in your patience possess ye
[27:14] your souls you may be seated and then
[27:17] the next thing we're going to talk about
[27:18] is godliness I'll go and read the
[27:19] scripture that we're gonna that we're
[27:21] gonna kind of maybe if you want to study
[27:22] for the next week or so and without
[27:24] controversy
[27:27] now how much controversy do we have even
[27:30] in the message of the hour tons of it
[27:32] but without controversy great is the
[27:36] mystery of godliness that you and I can
[27:39] understand that a world can look at
[27:41] their self and say I never can be like
[27:43] God
[27:44] but God can look at us and say you got
[27:46] to be like me
[27:49] so then if you've got to be like me I
[27:51] got to make a provision because you're
[27:52] not like me from the birth
[27:54] but you are like me from the new birth
[27:57] so God was manifest In the Flesh here's
[28:00] his plan manifested in the flesh
[28:02] justified in the spirit saint of angels
[28:05] preached into the Gentiles praise the
[28:07] Lord that's me and you believed on in
[28:10] the world and received up into glory and
[28:12] then what'd he do he came back on the
[28:14] day of Pentecost in 120 in the upper
[28:16] room to start this Plan of Redemption
[28:20] all right now we know that that Noah
[28:23] Moses the ones we were talking about
[28:25] today David they're all a part of that
[28:27] Plan of Redemption but they are not
[28:30] the bride
[28:31] they do not get to live if they get to
[28:34] live in the city it's just going to be
[28:36] an honor for them you and I that's our
[28:38] home that's our domain that's our place
[28:40] to live that's our place we're going to
[28:43] and you can say that place is mine
[28:45] yeah man
[28:47] not be given to somebody else but that
[28:50] place is mine you say how do you know
[28:52] God built a wall around it
[28:56] God built a wall around it why keep them
[28:58] out that don't need to be in
[29:00] you say that sounds strange no it don't
[29:02] sound strange at all that's what God's
[29:03] always built walls right
[29:05] right oh yeah tear down walls turned out
[29:07] well but the walls that God builds he
[29:09] separates us
[29:11] right see
[29:12] you and I have walls in our house
[29:14] because we don't want people to know
[29:16] what's going on inside the house right
[29:18] but now the Bible says that our new
[29:21] house
[29:22] that the walls are going to be
[29:24] transparent
[29:26] so everybody is walking by can see
[29:28] what's going on in your house because it
[29:29] ain't full of sin and all these other
[29:31] things it's full of goodness but there's
[29:33] a group of people that's going to have
[29:35] to stay outside that wall of City
[29:37] because they didn't come to a place
[29:38] they're going to get to come in
[29:41] and partake of the glory but they're
[29:43] gonna have to walk right back out of
[29:45] that City on the other side of those
[29:47] walls all right we'll preach on that
[29:48] just maybe a year from now to the Lord
[29:51] willing I want to preach on that because
[29:52] they are walls and God God likes walls
[29:55] if they he builds them we build walls
[29:59] he builds walls that's why he built them
[30:01] see the walls of Jericho was built by a
[30:03] man and God said nope I don't want that
[30:04] to happen I'm going to destroy those
[30:06] but there's a wall he built with that
[30:08] City that's coming down out of Heaven
[30:09] has a brighter dorm for his husband it
[30:12] is so adorned it's got pearls it's got
[30:14] you can't even fathom the amount of
[30:16] money that's going to be inside that
[30:18] City that's not going to cost you one
[30:20] dime
[30:20] not gonna cost you one dime it's just
[30:22] you know what's going to cost us it's
[30:24] going to cost us living the truth
[30:28] no money at all I like brother Brown
[30:30] preach the sermon it'll be the sermon
[30:32] one time said without money and without
[30:33] price
[30:34] you can't put a price on it but you
[30:36] can't spend there's no money that can
[30:38] buy that there's no billions and
[30:40] billions and billions of dollars can get
[30:41] you inside that City only by the new
[30:44] birth which is the freest gift you can
[30:45] ever get if you'll accept it
[30:47] so now we're going to talk about
[30:49] any birth what do we adding we were
[30:51] talking about this morning
[30:54] when we look at the at the the the Plan
[30:57] of Redemption
[30:59] um somebody had a question today so I'm
[31:00] going to try to answer it
[31:02] weave it into the sermon
[31:04] um so you got justification
[31:06] sanctification and baptism of the Holy
[31:07] Ghost now that's taught in the Bible
[31:09] That's taught by most most message
[31:12] Believers not so much maybe uh the
[31:15] Baptist kind of goes into a little bit
[31:17] of that but they're kind of once saved
[31:19] always save you know shake a hand turn
[31:20] around if you don't ever come back to
[31:22] church if you got a letter and you're
[31:23] sending our file they're gonna they're
[31:25] gonna preachers they're gonna preach
[31:27] your funeral and preach into heaven
[31:28] because you were a member in good
[31:30] standing or any of the others but as
[31:32] bride as as the message Believers when
[31:35] brother Brown comes and preaches he
[31:37] doesn't preach a new New Birth he just
[31:39] takes the the new birth that the
[31:41] denominational world has and he puts it
[31:43] all together remember he's the one he's
[31:45] like the Elijah did with the the uh the
[31:48] altar they they had he repaired the
[31:51] altar in that Old Testament because the
[31:54] denominational 400 and something
[31:56] prophets had Beat It Down hadn't messed
[31:58] the whole thing up so here goes Elijah
[32:00] he puts it all back together well the
[32:02] lives in this day he put it together he
[32:04] put uh sister cleita had a conduct order
[32:07] and Doctrine book I I had not lost mine
[32:10] it's just packed up somewhere and uh
[32:12] I've been trying to get it out and find
[32:14] it but that's contradictory and Doctrine
[32:16] book just tells you every Doctrine and
[32:17] tells you everything how to how to how
[32:19] to ordain deacons how to how to you know
[32:22] vote for pastors how to how to do your
[32:24] job everybody why brother around sat
[32:26] down one day and he preached several
[32:28] sermons but then he also come down and
[32:30] put they compiled it conduct
[32:33] order and Doctrine so that whole book
[32:36] those two books tells us exactly how to
[32:39] act
[32:41] right thank God
[32:44] because it's not it's not a different
[32:45] book than the Bible it's telling you
[32:47] exactly what the Bible's saying
[32:51] through the mouth of a prophet that's
[32:53] why we believe that God sent us a
[32:55] prophet we believe the brother Brown was
[32:57] a prophet because the prophet gets it
[32:59] from God and gives it to the people he
[33:01] doesn't even since Cleveland and I were
[33:03] talking about she's been to she was at
[33:05] some of the sermons that brother Brown
[33:06] preached but you can tell where brother
[33:08] Brown says I don't know what I just said
[33:10] but it had to be the truth
[33:12] I don't know what I just said in other
[33:13] words my face my lips get numb I get
[33:16] numb all over he said we don't remember
[33:18] when he's in discernment because brother
[33:20] Brown didn't know them people well he so
[33:22] much was so so yielded to God he just in
[33:25] his in his you know he didn't step over
[33:27] like this
[33:28] inside of him he just yielded himself to
[33:31] this to the holy ghost that came down
[33:34] upon him and the Holy Ghost is the one
[33:36] that spoke because Holy Ghost is one
[33:37] knew what to talk about
[33:39] brother Brown would have made a horrible
[33:40] mistake himself if Peter not yielded to
[33:43] the Holy Ghost
[33:44] though he'd be a prophet though he be a
[33:46] church age messenger don't he be filled
[33:48] with the Holy Ghost and like she and I
[33:50] were talking about he had an anointing
[33:52] to preach and he preached the word of
[33:53] God and I believe that was the
[33:55] mouthpiece of God
[33:56] but now at the end of the sermon what
[33:58] would he say
[34:00] I'm waiting on him well where he been
[34:02] the whole sermon
[34:05] he was in a different office he was
[34:07] preaching the word of God to the people
[34:09] now I'm waiting on him to anoint me to
[34:13] get me out of the totally out of the way
[34:16] so that he can use my eyes in my mouth
[34:18] and speak to to tell people they're
[34:20] troubling you know so detailed you know
[34:22] there's a lot of people I've been
[34:24] watching on YouTube there's a I can't
[34:26] remember the guy's name uh Roth or
[34:28] somebody like that he goes and he you
[34:30] know he he analyzes brother Branham Jack
[34:33] Cole all the different ones and then
[34:36] they you know they come back I always
[34:37] come back to brother Brown because his
[34:38] was so Supernatural
[34:40] because you know even even Jack Cohn the
[34:42] different ones they'd say well somebody
[34:43] here has got a headache or somebody
[34:45] hears that they didn't do brother
[34:47] Branham he'd tell you that you went to
[34:49] the doctor yesterday
[34:51] he told that one woman he said I see you
[34:53] sitting on your couch looking out the
[34:55] window having a fainting spell well he
[34:58] is so detailed to where there's no way
[35:01] there it can be mental telepathy because
[35:04] that woman probably didn't even remember
[35:06] she was sitting on the couch don't
[35:08] remember that the the preacher I mean
[35:11] the preacher that the doctor had on a
[35:12] red coat
[35:15] yeah
[35:16] because he was but brother Brown was out
[35:19] of the move out of the way Holy Ghost
[35:20] come down and he would tell him exactly
[35:22] because he could see what was going on
[35:24] now you and I
[35:26] we're waiting on that same anointing
[35:29] now I don't discernment to stand up here
[35:31] and tell you what you're thinking right
[35:32] now I just don't want to do that
[35:35] the ones you laughed I wonder what you
[35:37] were thinking
[35:41] but I want the word to be the discerner
[35:43] the word's gonna the words what's going
[35:44] to tell us right and wrong always it's
[35:47] not going to be a man it's going to be
[35:49] the word of God that's going to do it
[35:51] so what to make up to make that all come
[35:54] to this here we look at the word we put
[35:56] the emphasis we know that justifications
[35:59] right sanctification back to the Holy
[36:02] Ghost but we've got to go on further
[36:03] we've got to go to the word of God
[36:05] brother Ram even says faith alone won't
[36:06] do it and I'll read you here in just a
[36:08] few minutes where brother random is
[36:09] talking about again that again he's not
[36:11] just all Faith you can have faith even
[36:14] Paul says you can have faith to move a
[36:16] mountain
[36:17] and have not the Newberg or charity
[36:20] you're sounding brass in a tinkling
[36:22] symbol boy you think that was you know
[36:23] that was pretty good if you could move a
[36:25] mountain how many of y'all ever done
[36:26] that
[36:27] that's what I thought
[36:29] so how Slack are we if we consider that
[36:32] as the scripture that we need to take
[36:35] right
[36:37] but we put emphasis on the word of God
[36:39] changing me first and you first
[36:43] and then all these other things are
[36:45] going to come because we're going to
[36:46] look at just a few minutes to where if
[36:49] that Ministry is not honed down to where
[36:51] it's just like Jesus's Ministry he
[36:53] walked and can't come on the scene you
[36:56] say no he can't but he will because he
[36:59] knows there's a group of people that did
[37:01] come to that place of the honing and and
[37:05] what are we doing now I mean are we
[37:07] knocking big pieces off I mean if people
[37:09] get born again yeah they're knocking you
[37:10] understand what I mean everybody
[37:11] understand what I'm saying with the
[37:13] sculptor he knocks big pieces off at
[37:15] first
[37:17] smoking drinking cussing running around
[37:18] uh put you whatever on it but then to
[37:22] find detail is where the real master
[37:25] Craftsman
[37:27] uses his craft
[37:30] to to make sure that the eyebrows and
[37:32] the eyelashes and the and the and the
[37:35] eyelids are in detail well what does
[37:37] that mean that means he has to be real
[37:39] close and real intimate he's not sitting
[37:41] there brother John he's not sitting
[37:42] there we went through all those times
[37:43] and we're still going through them now
[37:45] we bring evangelists in they come in
[37:46] with a hammer and a chisel
[37:48] yeah hello brother Bob some of them they
[37:51] come in with a hammer and a chisel
[37:53] and I mean big pieces go flying
[37:56] but give me just a little opportunity if
[37:58] they knock the big pieces off that I'm
[38:00] that I can maybe smoothly make the
[38:03] fingers look good and make the eyes look
[38:05] good and make you
[38:07] hair look good and all these other
[38:09] things
[38:10] for the detail part to me that's the
[38:12] word of God that you and I are looking
[38:13] at today the big pieces like I said
[38:16] before yeah young young people coming in
[38:18] the message but we should be the place
[38:19] now where God is doing the detail work
[38:23] and to me the detail work is this made
[38:25] manifest in you and me the detail work
[38:28] is having virtue like God knowledge like
[38:30] God tempers like God patience like God
[38:34] so brother Brown says what is it the
[38:35] Holy Ghost bunch is honing out so that
[38:38] it can what fit with the same kind of
[38:40] ministry so what are we looking for we
[38:43] we are looking at the same kind of
[38:44] ministry that Jesus had
[38:46] same identical Ministry that Jesus had
[38:48] now we saw a part of that in brother
[38:50] Branham he was standing do like Jesus
[38:52] did Jesus said I see you uh you know you
[38:55] have you told the truth you don't you've
[38:58] been married five times and the one
[39:00] you're living with is not your husband
[39:01] all right so brother Brown would almost
[39:04] do the same thing
[39:06] he would discern the thoughts and
[39:08] intents of the heart but then what
[39:10] happened with that gift though brother
[39:12] Brown said only one for a generation so
[39:14] we're not looking for a we're not
[39:15] looking for somebody to rise up and have
[39:18] the same gift brother random had in that
[39:19] form there's no way
[39:22] seventh angel messenger is gone but in
[39:24] the days of the voice of the seventh
[39:26] angel in the days of The Voice
[39:29] that comes from the as we were singing
[39:31] the song about the trumpet and all the
[39:33] different things when we were I was
[39:35] thinking you know you you see that that
[39:37] um that brother that wrote it Is Well
[39:39] with My Soul he talks about trumpet
[39:41] talks about the coming of the Lord talks
[39:42] about he was looking to that listen
[39:45] we're fulfillment of that anointing that
[39:47] he felt back in the 1800s when he wrote
[39:49] that song It Is Well with My Soul all
[39:52] those verses are being fulfilled and
[39:54] played out right now
[39:56] he was looking at it because the
[39:58] anointing was on him and God was helping
[40:01] him depend that or actually God was
[40:03] pending himself who in the world would
[40:05] have come up with a song The Days of
[40:07] Elijah
[40:08] in this day
[40:10] not
[40:11] 20 years ago not 50 years ago not a
[40:14] hundred years ago but today
[40:16] the updated Revelation is there's an
[40:19] Elijah on the scene that was not Elijah
[40:21] on the scene Back Then There Was Elijah
[40:23] on the scene now these are the days of
[40:26] Elijah
[40:29] and what a revelation that is
[40:32] that we can put ourselves in the Bible
[40:34] not only know that brother Brown was a
[40:36] prophet but know that you're sitting
[40:37] under that same anointing that he was
[40:39] under as far as being in an ego
[40:42] anointing in this seventh angel message
[40:44] under the messenger of Malachi 4 which
[40:48] we understand that's message of brother
[40:50] Branham all right but you and I have got
[40:53] a part we can't separate ourselves and
[40:54] say well that was just all for brother
[40:56] random and nothing for us you and I
[40:58] we've got to what bring it together
[40:59] before brother Brown says right here
[41:01] look the tree of life is growing again
[41:02] well listen if the tree of life is
[41:04] growing again it's got to be growing in
[41:06] something it's got to be growing in your
[41:08] Earth all right not going to do any good
[41:11] you know this is Springtime we're going
[41:13] to start planting our fruit trees we're
[41:14] going to start planting this tonight and
[41:15] the other that's fine but how about
[41:17] let's planting some Holy Ghost Inside of
[41:19] us how about us planting some some
[41:21] virtue and knowledge and Temperance and
[41:23] patience inside of us
[41:25] and let's get this thing growing right
[41:28] and then this morning we're talking
[41:30] about the seals and we'll get back to
[41:32] all that because because see when we get
[41:34] to the headstone
[41:35] and I'm gonna bring a little chart
[41:37] um
[41:38] the next time I preach
[41:41] and we'll break all that down again
[41:42] because see we're we're living in the
[41:44] age of the son of man but right now what
[41:47] I'm preaching to you right now is not
[41:49] the message of the son of man
[41:51] it's the message of the son of God
[41:54] because we're still in the church ages
[41:55] we're still bringing what was already
[41:58] preached what I'm preaching to you right
[42:00] now excluding the quotes that brother
[42:04] Branham verbatim quoted Bible and and
[42:08] and then preaching or giving you a
[42:10] commentary of what went on in history
[42:12] what we're looking at virtue wise was
[42:15] back two thousand years ago in Peter
[42:16] because Peter's Wonder wrote it Peter
[42:18] wrote it because that's what he was
[42:20] getting into that's what he was
[42:22] add to your faith virtue and all those
[42:24] tempers so I'm not preaching I'm not
[42:26] preaching something old but I am
[42:28] preaching something that's already been
[42:29] preached so that's the Son of God
[42:32] Revelation and that's going to get you
[42:33] the new birth it's going to make you a
[42:35] powerhouse it's going to make you do
[42:36] these things to make you live better you
[42:39] know Shine Your Light in Walmart
[42:41] not shining your other things in Walmart
[42:43] a lot of people trying other things in
[42:45] Walmart
[42:47] but it'll make you act different but
[42:49] that's not the headstone
[42:53] that's not the message of the son of man
[42:57] the message of the son of man is a
[42:59] message that never hit the Earth
[43:01] until now like it was two thousand years
[43:04] ago because that's quote I just gave you
[43:06] right here the Holy Ghost Bunch honed
[43:08] out so that it can fit with the same
[43:10] kind of ministry look and not the
[43:11] ministry of the church ages the ministry
[43:14] he had
[43:16] when he went away that's two thousand
[43:19] years ago that's the same Ministry he
[43:22] had that when he comes back
[43:27] he's here
[43:29] when he comes back it'll catch the whole
[43:32] thing in a Rapture who's the whole thing
[43:34] you me all right we're the Justified
[43:38] Sanctified baptism of the Holy Ghost
[43:39] that pyramid will stand again the house
[43:41] of God will live again the tree of life
[43:43] is growing
[43:44] again that's what we've got to believe
[43:46] that we're part of it we're not looking
[43:48] to see it come we are living it today
[43:52] and let's not miss our day of visitation
[43:57] nothing between my soul and my savior
[44:03] nothing
[44:04] feelings emotions yeah that's all good
[44:07] but you can get sure tied up and all
[44:09] that
[44:10] but when you become the word made flesh
[44:12] you look at Jesus Jesus never screamed
[44:15] Jesus never hollered
[44:18] right
[44:19] he had authority to empower because he
[44:22] had all these virtues he didn't have
[44:23] them working in him he was them right
[44:26] and that's the same way with me and you
[44:28] we got to have these virtues and they're
[44:31] a requirement for us to have
[44:34] we are made partakers of his Holiness we
[44:36] In His Image we are living images of a
[44:40] living God now listen when Jesus walks
[44:42] up to a mirror and looks in the mirror
[44:45] he sees who himself
[44:49] right
[44:51] when you walk up in front of the mirror
[44:53] if you're gonna look like the Living God
[44:55] you're gonna look like Jesus Christ
[44:59] you said that's weird no it's not weird
[45:02] that's what he just said right here we
[45:04] are living images
[45:05] because God gave us a mandate back in
[45:09] the eternities in Genesis 1 26. he said
[45:12] let us make man in our own what image
[45:16] and our own likeness
[45:19] and let them have dominion over the face
[45:22] of the sea and foul the air and
[45:24] everything that creepers and runneth all
[45:25] and walketh all over the Earth
[45:27] we are living images of a living God
[45:29] then dead to self
[45:32] raised with him now listen listen to
[45:35] this so listen listen to this
[45:37] his word made flesh again in US
[45:41] oh brother Neville what is it not the
[45:44] mythical imaginary God sitting out there
[45:46] but the Living God what is the Living
[45:48] God the word in you makes itself real
[45:53] the word in you not the word in here
[45:56] not to not the millions of translations
[45:58] not the different Doctrine but the word
[46:00] in you
[46:01] he said glory to God I know you think
[46:04] I'm a Holy Roller it was hard for them
[46:06] people to swallow some of that but the
[46:08] word of God which is God is made flesh
[46:11] in you
[46:13] why you're seated in Heavenly places
[46:15] triumph over all things
[46:17] in Christ Jesus
[46:19] well listen we got to get out of that
[46:22] outer Court
[46:24] you've got to get into the inner Court
[46:26] in the holy of holies you stay in the
[46:28] outer court and you're going to have bad
[46:30] days and good days
[46:33] sunny days and rainy days
[46:37] but see if you've already been into the
[46:39] inner Court
[46:41] there's one thing for sure if you have
[46:43] to come back out you know how to handle
[46:44] it a lot better than you did when you
[46:45] were standing out here when you first
[46:47] walked into the court
[46:50] I always say that
[46:53] I hope we see that we're going to have
[46:55] bad days and good days I'm not saying
[46:56] they alleviate themselves but it helps
[46:59] because you gotta what overcome them
[47:03] some some people can't overcome their
[47:05] bad days
[47:07] they just have them in a row
[47:10] quit having them in a row it's your
[47:12] fault if you do
[47:14] God's not gonna make keep you in that
[47:16] funk that you're in
[47:17] you keep yourself in it
[47:20] that's because negative confession I
[47:22] can't this and I can't that remember God
[47:24] cannot deal with unconfession
[47:27] he don't know how to do that for a
[47:29] negative confession he can't deal with
[47:30] it right
[47:31] and if you keep it inside of you he
[47:33] can't deal with it either because you
[47:34] got to make profession you got to
[47:37] profess what you're believing inside of
[47:39] you all right as we go through this
[47:41] statue of perfect man it's not just to
[47:44] to say well well here's here's virtue
[47:46] Donnie now here this this is all you
[47:48] need all you need for verse you're here
[47:49] there you go that's it no it's
[47:52] everything it's this whole building it's
[47:54] this whole town whole Community whole
[47:57] universe so we can preach on
[47:59] justification sanctification by baptism
[48:01] the Holy Ghost never get away from one
[48:03] God never get away from the seals never
[48:05] get away from anything because that's
[48:07] the plan of redemption so that's what
[48:09] we're trying to speak on today
[48:11] is getting on up this statue but we got
[48:14] can't do it while we're still down here
[48:16] deep calls into the deep
[48:20] that was another question today somebody
[48:21] asked
[48:23] you got to remember
[48:25] there are three kinds of Believers in a
[48:27] church
[48:28] all right there's the the full full
[48:30] believer
[48:31] there's the mate believer and there's
[48:34] your unbeliever all right now that's
[48:35] what the prophet of God said so so we
[48:38] have to deal with that and as ministers
[48:41] that's like brother Dale's always you
[48:42] know he's kind of
[48:44] I asked you one time
[48:46] that's how you deal with these people
[48:50] he said well I just
[48:53] pretty much he didn't say this exact
[48:55] words but he said I just preached that
[48:57] they're all good
[48:58] and then they got to decide whether
[48:59] they're bad or not
[49:01] because I can't keep saying well you're
[49:02] bad you're bad you're no you didn't
[49:04] decide whether you're bad or not all
[49:07] right because I believe we've had the
[49:08] word of God preached to us and like I
[49:09] told you several times I'll tell you
[49:11] again we've had the revelation of the
[49:14] message of the hour what are we doing
[49:16] with it
[49:17] what are we doing with it are we setting
[49:19] it well you put it under our rear end
[49:21] and we sat down on it or are we using it
[49:23] using it against the devil because the
[49:25] only thing that the use Jesus had all
[49:29] kind of power
[49:31] when the devil walked up to him and gave
[49:33] him three different things to to tempt
[49:36] him with what did he do
[49:38] he said it is written
[49:40] how many times when we get into an issue
[49:43] and we say
[49:45] Lord
[49:46] didn't you say or either say Satan it is
[49:49] written right here in the Bible I'm
[49:51] going to resist you and you've got to
[49:52] flee from me
[49:55] you know what that's too simple we want
[49:56] to do something
[49:58] we want to get our special book out or
[50:00] our special tape or read our special
[50:02] sermon or watch our special preacher on
[50:04] the internet
[50:06] well praise the Lord anyway
[50:09] but there's
[50:10] True Believers make Believers and
[50:12] unbelievers let's just cover that just
[50:14] for a minute
[50:15] because the question was like coming to
[50:17] church you know the desire the deep that
[50:19] caused to the Deep I'll promise you one
[50:22] thing's for sure
[50:24] according to the word of God
[50:27] a Believer will always be in church
[50:35] everybody with me
[50:37] a May believer
[50:40] comes
[50:42] because I'm going to call them something
[50:44] I'm going to call them something else if
[50:46] they don't
[50:47] that's a May believer
[50:49] I say I whoever
[50:52] I'm not the only one preaching them
[50:53] coming to church everybody preaching on
[50:55] coming to church because you know what a
[50:56] True Believer come to church
[50:58] so the main Believers say exactly that
[51:00] it's a make-believer they make believe
[51:02] that they believe in what you think that
[51:04] they're believing
[51:05] but an unbeliever just don't come to
[51:07] church
[51:08] and they're just they just don't believe
[51:10] that it's doing them any good so they
[51:11] stay out of church so that's an
[51:12] unbeliever so you got your good your
[51:14] True Believers which will always come to
[51:16] church then you've got your
[51:18] make-believers which will come every
[51:19] once in a while all right then you got
[51:22] the ones that just are unbelievers and
[51:24] that's just why they're called
[51:25] unbelievers they don't believe that the
[51:27] Bible's right they don't believe that
[51:30] every promise is for them they don't
[51:31] believe that paying tithes will give you
[51:35] or will pour out a a gift from Heaven
[51:37] from God that you can't contain they
[51:40] don't believe that coming to church is
[51:42] important
[51:43] so they're unbelievers
[51:46] and who made them that
[51:48] they did
[51:49] right
[51:54] but we we need to and and there's no way
[51:58] that we can say well
[52:00] Michael's a believer in June's an
[52:03] unbeliever and listen to make believe
[52:04] that's not for I don't stand here and
[52:06] judge that doesn't neither I don't think
[52:08] another Minister stand here and just
[52:10] just judge I'm gonna tell them Lily
[52:14] we had suffered with him last night and
[52:16] she says she just has a hard time
[52:18] getting up and coming to church she just
[52:19] has a hard time getting here early
[52:21] so but but she was saying she was she
[52:25] she was saying I she says I just know
[52:28] every time you say that said you're said
[52:30] you I feel this finger right here
[52:31] between my eyes
[52:33] it's a bullet hole
[52:36] not my finger
[52:48] but do you feel that way when the
[52:49] preacher's preaching to you about
[52:50] anything I'm not talking about just
[52:51] coming to church anything I do
[52:54] but see brother there when he hit me
[52:56] when he was preaching all the time he
[52:57] didn't just hit me between the eyes my
[52:59] head hit the ground
[53:02] went rolling I had to you know like a
[53:04] bowling ball that winter went awry we
[53:06] hadn't picked that bowling ball up and
[53:07] take it back on top of my head
[53:09] you know why though because there's
[53:10] something inside of me that wants to do
[53:12] better
[53:14] because an unbeliever said I really
[53:16] don't care what you say preacher I ain't
[53:18] coming to church that's an unbeliever
[53:21] all right but a True Believer has got a
[53:23] desire or a deed that calls out that
[53:25] says hey I got to do better
[53:28] not that I got to I want to do better
[53:30] listen I want God to be able to fulfill
[53:34] his promise
[53:36] if he said I'll pour out of a blessing
[53:39] on you you can't contain brother John
[53:41] I'm gonna make sure my tithe gets paid
[53:43] first
[53:47] he tells us for Satan not assembling us
[53:50] self together brother Brian quote direct
[53:52] quote brother Brown said you can't wait
[53:53] till those doors open
[53:55] to come in and fellowship not with each
[53:57] other but with God
[53:58] okay
[54:00] and then he does tell us to be there 30
[54:02] minutes before the service starts
[54:05] so that we can worship and get clean
[54:08] clean yourself up you know get all that
[54:10] stuff pushed away from you and listen to
[54:12] the song service and pray there is
[54:14] something behind what what brother Brown
[54:16] tells us if you look in that conduct
[54:18] order and Doctrine book I'm just going
[54:19] to preach a little bit you're looking at
[54:20] contractor and Doctrine book brother
[54:22] Brown didn't put that in there just
[54:24] because it was his his thought or idea
[54:27] all of it was biblical he took things
[54:30] that maybe we we think well maybe that's
[54:32] not too important but brother remember
[54:33] bring it out said no this is important
[54:35] and this is where you need to place it
[54:37] that's what a true Prophet does he
[54:39] places he takes it like a jigsaw puzzle
[54:41] you know you throw the pieces out all
[54:43] over the house that's what man's done
[54:44] with the word of God they just drove to
[54:46] Pieces all over the house
[54:47] and then brother Branham by the
[54:50] anointing of God not by his own
[54:51] anointing but by the anointing of God he
[54:54] takes and puts peace together
[54:56] just where this has got to go and this
[54:58] is I was like we were talking about last
[55:00] night
[55:01] they won't ever invite me in June back
[55:02] over again but
[55:04] lately now we were talking about she's
[55:06] like me
[55:08] you know
[55:13] you're going to do it because I told you
[55:14] to do it
[55:15] right
[55:17] because I'm the mama or I'm the daddy
[55:19] oh I want to know why
[55:22] tell me why I got to do that why because
[55:24] I said so no well same thing with God
[55:27] now he's that way in a way but he wants
[55:29] to tell you why
[55:31] he's a loving God that's why there's not
[55:33] just Ten Commandments written in this
[55:35] Bible that's why there's a lot of this
[55:37] stuff in the Bible and all the
[55:39] in-between stuff is to show us why he
[55:43] said no you can't do this why he said
[55:45] because if you take the forsake
[55:48] assembling yourself together you can
[55:50] just say well that's what Paul said or
[55:52] that's what brother Brown said what's in
[55:54] the Bible
[55:55] if God was if it was important enough
[55:57] for him to put in the Bible
[55:58] it's important for us to reap the
[56:00] benefits from it
[56:05] and that's our issue folks I'm telling
[56:07] you I can tell people that don't pay
[56:09] times I can tell people don't come to
[56:11] church all the time you fight and
[56:13] struggle all the time there's a problem
[56:14] somewhere there's an issue there's a
[56:16] blah blah blah blah blah just whatever
[56:18] you want to put in there
[56:19] you're not settled
[56:23] well I don't believe you've become an
[56:24] unbeliever
[56:26] I don't believe I have to do that well
[56:28] okay then you're leaving that
[56:30] unbelieving part
[56:32] but you see how this is we shouldn't be
[56:34] talking about this this far up the road
[56:35] but we do we have to because it reminds
[56:39] us and it keeps us
[56:41] from being Slack
[56:43] because Satan would love for us to just
[56:45] be Slack
[56:47] he's a slacker himself and he just wants
[56:49] us to be Slack
[56:54] but have you ever had a
[56:58] back to Lily and Zach
[57:01] Lily was uh
[57:04] it was good food probably never get it
[57:06] again but that was good
[57:08] we'll invite you at our house next time
[57:09] and then you can talk about that you can
[57:10] get up here and talk about us okay I'm
[57:12] not talking to you Zach I'm talking to
[57:14] Lily yeah
[57:17] but but lately was and and Lily was
[57:20] telling the story about how that you
[57:21] know her and she had a boyfriend in the
[57:23] past and and that she was really was
[57:26] hurt by him and she was you know almost
[57:30] turning away from the message right
[57:32] almost turning away from the message
[57:34] because of the hurt and the pain
[57:38] but she said then I saw Zach
[57:48] and let me tell you about I'm gonna give
[57:50] you a star now Zach
[57:52] what did she see
[57:57] she didn't see that black
[57:59] she saw somebody that treated her
[58:01] different
[58:02] acted like Christ around her
[58:05] and when that was an issue what did Zach
[58:07] say Lily let's pray
[58:10] let's read our Bible together
[58:17] the Lord brought you back through Zach
[58:20] and then you know what you got to marry
[58:22] him
[58:23] what a bonus
[58:25] praise the Lord but that's the way it
[58:27] works with God
[58:29] when there's a real true courtship
[58:31] that's the same as you and God getting
[58:33] to know each other
[58:34] that's the same as getting married and
[58:37] becoming a new Christian and and not
[58:39] knowing everything but but but what
[58:41] happened with us our our husband got us
[58:44] out of all the junk that we were fixing
[58:45] to get in we were fixing to turn away
[58:49] right
[58:50] but we saw something different
[58:56] saw something different
[58:58] and there was a what there was something
[59:00] inside
[59:01] see Lily didn't know as Lily was walking
[59:05] through the issues that she had she
[59:08] didn't know that there was a Zack there
[59:13] but when Zach came in front of her
[59:15] I'm making a point here
[59:17] but when Zach came in front of her and I
[59:19] think Josiah was the one that kind of
[59:21] put them together and they saw each
[59:22] other's picture and uh blah blah blah
[59:24] anyway
[59:26] make you sick but um when you see that
[59:29] that's the same way it was with the Lord
[59:31] I mean there's a desire to do right
[59:34] there's a desire to love something
[59:36] inside of you but you don't know exactly
[59:38] what his name is
[59:40] but then when that person is put in
[59:42] front of you oh that's why
[59:45] oh that's why I love him so much he's so
[59:48] cute
[59:51] he's so sweet
[59:53] he treats me good
[59:56] well then that's the way it should be
[59:57] with the Lord have you ever felt if you
[59:58] could take that and transfer that to the
[1:00:00] feeling you have with God of God
[1:00:03] because he's your husband
[1:00:05] he's your lover right we're supposed to
[1:00:08] love him more than we love our spouse
[1:00:10] but that's a real good analogy that
[1:00:12] there's a deep sitting there that's
[1:00:14] called Jesus Christ The Life of Christ
[1:00:16] we just don't know it
[1:00:19] we go to justification sanctification
[1:00:21] but boy when we come into the intimacy
[1:00:23] of the new birth we get to know him that
[1:00:25] much more
[1:00:26] we get to live with him we get to be
[1:00:28] with him we get to talk to him
[1:00:30] I know if this is boring you then you
[1:00:32] ain't born again
[1:00:34] but that deep is calling to a deep
[1:00:37] that was inside of you yeah we know that
[1:00:39] it wasn't some seed laying there that
[1:00:40] was eternal we know it's not that but
[1:00:42] there was something in man that wanted
[1:00:45] to love a god
[1:00:48] remember bro didn't Brothers say he put
[1:00:50] that desire in you
[1:00:52] to worship and love something right
[1:00:56] so you just didn't know his name yet you
[1:00:59] didn't know his name was that black did
[1:01:01] you
[1:01:02] but oh boy when you're dead
[1:01:04] one more time
[1:01:09] she got love sick
[1:01:11] and didn't want to be healed
[1:01:13] [Laughter]
[1:01:16] they're just the cutest couple
[1:01:19] but you know I want I want the bride and
[1:01:21] and Christ to be the same way
[1:01:24] the cutest couple that ever lived
[1:01:27] knows each other intimately
[1:01:29] knows each other in their like I said
[1:01:32] the deepest call when that deep calls
[1:01:34] there's a deep to respond so Lily had a
[1:01:38] deep for a a good Christian man you know
[1:01:40] what there he was
[1:01:42] there was the Deep to respond the part
[1:01:45] to respond to that deep call that she
[1:01:47] had a desire
[1:01:48] that she wanted to have a boyfriend and
[1:01:51] she wanted to have a husband that was
[1:01:52] our desire now that's the same way with
[1:01:54] me and you
[1:01:55] do you have that
[1:01:57] because brother Ryan said look before
[1:01:58] there can be a deep there has to be a
[1:02:00] deep to respond to it so there had to be
[1:02:02] a Zack black here
[1:02:04] oh listen we ain't putting here just for
[1:02:06] nothing
[1:02:06] I'm telling you even in the natural
[1:02:10] you better thank God if you got a Godly
[1:02:12] wife for a Godly husband
[1:02:14] some can't say that
[1:02:17] before there can be a deep call that had
[1:02:19] to be a deep to respond so listen before
[1:02:23] we started this series on the Statue of
[1:02:25] perfect map or even before brother
[1:02:27] Branham started this series on the
[1:02:29] Statue of perfect man there was
[1:02:30] something laying there in
[1:02:43] why do you not want to be closer to God
[1:02:45] why do you not want to be closer to you
[1:02:47] mate why are you not want to be closer
[1:02:48] to you love her
[1:02:51] as you people a few years ago who
[1:02:53] probably were Sinners maybe you were in
[1:02:55] some formal church that didn't believe
[1:02:56] in the baptism of the Holy Spirit but
[1:02:58] you heard the message there was
[1:03:00] something in there called out for what
[1:03:03] more of God not just God more of God to
[1:03:07] me this is more of God
[1:03:11] you might have been living in a
[1:03:12] Justified State before God but you
[1:03:15] wanted the baptism of the Holy Spirit
[1:03:16] and you hungered for it
[1:03:20] I want to ask you a question little
[1:03:22] church have you ever just hungered for
[1:03:24] the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:03:26] I did because I knew I didn't have it
[1:03:29] and I knew how I was supposed to act
[1:03:32] when I did get it
[1:03:34] because I was taught well so I had a
[1:03:36] background you've got a background you
[1:03:38] can't say I don't know how to act
[1:03:41] it's been explained over and over again
[1:03:44] in detail how it's supposed to make you
[1:03:46] act
[1:03:47] but you wanted the baptism of the Holy
[1:03:50] Spirit and you hungered for it now the
[1:03:52] very reason that there is a holy spirit
[1:03:54] is because you were hungering for him
[1:03:56] the very reason you ought to be a better
[1:03:59] have more knowledge
[1:04:01] of God
[1:04:03] are more Temperance are more patience is
[1:04:07] because there's more to get
[1:04:09] all right amen there's more to get
[1:04:13] but he's going to put us in an evil age
[1:04:14] he's going to put us in the worst time
[1:04:16] he's going to put us in the uh
[1:04:18] Michael he's putting us in the worst
[1:04:20] time there ever was
[1:04:23] right but now remember
[1:04:25] the Wright brothers
[1:04:27] didn't go up in the first rocket
[1:04:30] everybody understand what I'm talking so
[1:04:32] many older people know Google it
[1:04:34] who the Wright brothers are the Wright
[1:04:36] brothers are the first one that that um
[1:04:39] I think Joyce was there with him in the
[1:04:40] plane in 19 about 1917
[1:04:44] .
[1:04:45] no around 1900 they weren't they going
[1:04:48] to build a flying machine
[1:04:50] so they put together this piece of wood
[1:04:52] and these pedals and this turning thing
[1:04:56] and they go to Kitty Hawk North Carolina
[1:04:59] and they get on this big Bluff you know
[1:05:01] flat place and then here's there's a
[1:05:04] real place that sings way down
[1:05:06] and they decide that man can fly if they
[1:05:09] can just put everything together just
[1:05:11] right
[1:05:12] so guess what they did they boy they you
[1:05:14] know Orville and Wilbur they're once
[1:05:17] pushing and the other ones you know
[1:05:18] chugging along chugging along and here
[1:05:20] they go and man I think the first flight
[1:05:22] only lasted a couple of minutes
[1:05:25] before they crash landed
[1:05:30] that was a beginning
[1:05:32] that was you wanting more of God
[1:05:35] put you in a vehicle
[1:05:38] and you that was vehicle was okay
[1:05:41] because out of that came what came to
[1:05:43] planes with the duel
[1:05:44] um you know the the ones in 1917 during
[1:05:47] the war then by the time the next war
[1:05:49] came up they had a
[1:05:52] airplane that could shoot guns and and
[1:05:55] fly 600 miles an hour
[1:05:57] all right Orville Wilber weren't on that
[1:06:00] one
[1:06:01] then you come up to now where they're
[1:06:02] putting them in Rockets now and sending
[1:06:04] them places and bringing the same rocket
[1:06:06] back that used to not be when we were
[1:06:08] growing up they wasted billions of
[1:06:10] dollars when we were growing up because
[1:06:11] you put the big rocket up this one fell
[1:06:13] over here and went into the water and
[1:06:15] this one they needed for so much oxygen
[1:06:17] and not so much power to do this you
[1:06:19] understand what I'm saying
[1:06:20] that's the same way we are in the word
[1:06:22] of God what if Orville and Wilbur would
[1:06:24] have said we can't fly
[1:06:28] or to them to and transported them into
[1:06:31] 2023 and send them over to Elon Musk and
[1:06:35] they said we want to fly that thing
[1:06:37] disaster
[1:06:39] so they had to grow that's why you and I
[1:06:41] we had to grow and God put us in the
[1:06:43] worst time
[1:06:46] but I believe he saved the best for last
[1:06:50] he put us in the worst time for a
[1:06:53] purpose
[1:06:55] to prove what to prove to Satan
[1:06:57] that we can get it done
[1:07:00] that we cannot just fly 20 or 30 feet
[1:07:02] that we can fly
[1:07:05] talk listen talk about where that came
[1:07:07] from in 1900 I don't know what year it
[1:07:09] was maybe 1906 or whatever it was
[1:07:11] somewhere in there
[1:07:13] where that was just a piece of paper
[1:07:17] to where now we get in them
[1:07:19] and I can fly from here to the
[1:07:21] Philippines
[1:07:23] if you ever just fathom how man
[1:07:26] took one piece of equipment that that
[1:07:28] held one person
[1:07:31] a hundred years ago
[1:07:34] all right 100 and something years ago
[1:07:35] and then now
[1:07:37] we can fly from here to the Philippines
[1:07:39] with 450 people on board
[1:07:42] have a double decker with thousands of
[1:07:44] pounds of luggage underneath thousands
[1:07:47] of pounds they fed us three meals a day
[1:07:50] for 400 and some people so that's how
[1:07:52] many meals they had to store in that
[1:07:53] airplane brother John then they had to
[1:07:55] put enough fuel to keep me in the air
[1:07:57] for 19 hours
[1:08:01] and the engines you know there's several
[1:08:04] of them but they're only about that big
[1:08:05] around
[1:08:06] but they got so much force why
[1:08:08] technology now if man has progressed to
[1:08:11] that group to that part what about God
[1:08:14] that's why he had to send an astronaut
[1:08:16] in the end time call Brother Brown they
[1:08:18] could take us up and that we could
[1:08:19] handle the what Brethren said we are
[1:08:21] pressurized for this job you and I are
[1:08:24] pressurized for what's going on today we
[1:08:27] may think and like I said before quit
[1:08:29] looking at the mixed multitude not
[1:08:31] everybody is Israel not everybody is
[1:08:33] bride listen I'm not going to separate
[1:08:36] them brother Dale's not going to
[1:08:37] separate them and the brothers are not
[1:08:39] going to separate them you'll separate
[1:08:41] yourself
[1:08:46] as I was telling
[1:08:48] sister Regina
[1:08:51] Noah preached 120 years
[1:08:56] and God had him build a boat
[1:09:00] stood at the door the prophet said and
[1:09:02] preached I'll read if I get to it it may
[1:09:04] not get to it preached 120 years
[1:09:06] standing at the door of the Ark
[1:09:09] and only eight people went in
[1:09:12] but I'll promise you there was a
[1:09:14] Congregation of thousands standing
[1:09:16] around Noah listening to what he had to
[1:09:18] say
[1:09:19] that never made it
[1:09:22] God is a separator folks
[1:09:24] we can soft soap this thing and you can
[1:09:26] pet your babies and you can pet your
[1:09:28] wife and you can pet your husband all
[1:09:30] you want to there's a day brother round
[1:09:32] said there's a day coming when God's
[1:09:34] going to shut that door and then
[1:09:35] whatever decision you made you're going
[1:09:37] to deal with it whether you're outside
[1:09:38] or inside
[1:09:40] I've always always you know God shut the
[1:09:43] door no it didn't God shut the door so
[1:09:45] Noah didn't say well now it's time for
[1:09:47] me to shut the door no God just said get
[1:09:49] in the ark today I'm shutting the door
[1:09:50] he didn't give him a heads up he'd been
[1:09:53] giving 120 years a heads up
[1:09:55] and he when he shut that door remember
[1:09:58] it was pitched inside and out with tar
[1:10:01] I promise you when that water started
[1:10:03] coming up and The Fountains of the deep
[1:10:04] start opening up and California Saints
[1:10:06] everybody with me
[1:10:08] there was nail prints from people trying
[1:10:11] to crawl up that Ark
[1:10:13] didn't happen
[1:10:15] they didn't get in God's provided way
[1:10:17] they didn't go through the door
[1:10:25] think about that
[1:10:29] virtue knowledge Temperance now we're
[1:10:31] we're Temperance Temperance is
[1:10:33] self-control
[1:10:34] we talked about a little bit this
[1:10:35] morning
[1:10:36] it's mastering our desires and passions
[1:10:38] and we don't have that just not that's
[1:10:40] just not sexual okay come on people we
[1:10:42] have desires for other things that we
[1:10:44] passions that we like I said before
[1:10:47] it's real strange to me
[1:10:50] I'm hold on
[1:10:53] I'm on my box now
[1:10:56] it's real strange to me how that you
[1:10:58] ladies can shop all day
[1:11:01] all day
[1:11:04] hours
[1:11:13] make sure you're on time
[1:11:19] and be happy while you're shopping
[1:11:21] brother John say today
[1:11:24] and be real ecstatic when you come home
[1:11:27] with deals
[1:11:30] you spent how long to get them deals
[1:11:33] did you take a nap
[1:11:36] that was so exciting we had something
[1:11:37] did you go to the bathroom no I just got
[1:11:39] so cold up here that I didn't go to the
[1:11:41] bathroom for four or five hours
[1:11:43] can't sit in here for an hour and a half
[1:11:48] didn't watch a movie for three hours and
[1:11:49] never move
[1:11:52] and be happy about it
[1:12:01] by your words and your actions you will
[1:12:04] be justified in by your words and your
[1:12:06] actions you will be condemned
[1:12:10] we used to go to football games and we'd
[1:12:12] sit there watch the Georgia Bulldogs
[1:12:13] play Never Move never move a muscle be
[1:12:16] just as happy to jump up and down shout
[1:12:18] and scream
[1:12:23] I'd rather do this now
[1:12:27] self-control
[1:12:29] the virtue of one who Masters look
[1:12:31] Masters his desires
[1:12:33] listen it's all right to shop that's
[1:12:36] saying one thing against it all your
[1:12:37] sisters are like no do I shop all you
[1:12:40] want to
[1:12:42] but don't shop so much until you shop on
[1:12:44] Saturday and then Sunday you don't come
[1:12:45] to church
[1:12:47] hello somebody Regina keep smiling
[1:12:50] you're good you're good back there
[1:12:53] but once that's what you're desire and
[1:12:54] your passion is
[1:12:56] what is your desire
[1:12:58] surprise
[1:13:02] but you master it or control it or look
[1:13:05] curb it
[1:13:06] restraining controlling oneself
[1:13:09] temperate continent
[1:13:12] brother remember I said tempers doesn't
[1:13:13] mean stop drinking alcohol all right it
[1:13:15] means what
[1:13:16] Holy Spirit Temperance is what
[1:13:18] controlling your temper
[1:13:20] not flying off when everybody speaks
[1:13:22] somebody when a preacher tells you need
[1:13:24] to be in church
[1:13:28] because if you don't come that crosses
[1:13:30] you every time you say something about
[1:13:32] even even when we're you talk to
[1:13:34] somebody out in the world brother
[1:13:35] Donnie's done it you talk to somebody
[1:13:36] and you're talking this good Baptist guy
[1:13:38] and you're talking to him you're talking
[1:13:39] to him about the Lord Lord's great he
[1:13:41] died on the cross and he come to save us
[1:13:43] and brother Donnie says now is that
[1:13:46] three of them or one of them
[1:13:48] yeah which one of them you
[1:13:54] he gets there gets their attention and
[1:13:56] their righteousness indignation your
[1:13:58] daddy was the best of them
[1:14:01] but what it was he's telling them the
[1:14:03] truth and that truth wasn't in them
[1:14:05] there was a part truth but it wasn't all
[1:14:07] the truth they believe in the Lord Jesus
[1:14:10] Christ but do they believe he's one God
[1:14:12] oh they believe he's the second person
[1:14:14] of a trinity
[1:14:16] boy a lot of us are going to fall off
[1:14:17] before we get started aren't we then we
[1:14:20] wonder why God is not in his church
[1:14:21] doing Miracles and things that they used
[1:14:24] to do yes sir
[1:14:26] Temperance says how to answer in
[1:14:27] kindness when wrathus spoke to you
[1:14:29] somebody says you bunch of Holy Rollers
[1:14:32] don't jump up and down and roll your
[1:14:33] sleeve up now but talk with Godly love
[1:14:36] Temperance kindness
[1:14:39] is that the way you want to be in the
[1:14:40] congregation says amen when you're riled
[1:14:43] up round up back let him be your example
[1:14:46] if you still blow up in Fast and fuss
[1:14:48] and stew and carry on uh-huh you ain't
[1:14:50] got no you can't add that because it
[1:14:52] won't add it won't vulcanize can't take
[1:14:55] Rubber and vulcanize it to Iron same
[1:14:57] kind of Holy Ghost Temperance that he
[1:14:59] had then it will vulcanize with him
[1:15:01] you're added it too let's just keep
[1:15:03] going on
[1:15:04] when you can really have Sweetness in
[1:15:07] your heart forgive every person hold
[1:15:08] your peace let it be gone
[1:15:11] I mean can we do that
[1:15:15] I mean I know as a human being and as as
[1:15:18] we struggle through this
[1:15:20] and it is a struggle we struggle through
[1:15:22] this it's contrary to all of our nature
[1:15:25] that we were growing up with
[1:15:27] when you were a little boy what was your
[1:15:28] nature do it to me I'll do it to you
[1:15:32] and if I can I'll do it to you worse
[1:15:34] than you did it to me all right
[1:15:36] we used to you know use the Golden Rule
[1:15:38] used to be doing to others as you do
[1:15:39] they do unto you
[1:15:41] well the golden rule we had was to do it
[1:15:44] to others and run real fast
[1:15:47] but that's the way it was human nature
[1:15:49] we always want to get back at the person
[1:15:52] that does us wrong
[1:15:54] well get quiet would you
[1:15:56] but it's exactly what you grew up with
[1:15:59] but when you can really with Sweetness
[1:16:01] in your heart forgive every man hold
[1:16:04] your peace let it be gone then it will
[1:16:06] vulcanize you can add that to your faith
[1:16:10] all right
[1:16:11] and vulcanization you all know it can't
[1:16:13] be it can't be reversed
[1:16:16] because once listen once God hit I want
[1:16:19] to ask you a question everybody's
[1:16:20] sitting here
[1:16:21] today
[1:16:22] is in some form of
[1:16:25] uh the new birth may I say either in
[1:16:28] justification sanctification baptism
[1:16:30] Holy Ghost some are way up to Pyramid
[1:16:32] some are in different sections and some
[1:16:34] of us are struggling some a lot of us
[1:16:36] are you know worried that we can't do
[1:16:39] this or this is going to be really hard
[1:16:41] but have you since we've been starting
[1:16:43] this though have you
[1:16:46] had something come to your attention
[1:16:47] that hadn't come to it before
[1:16:51] because see that's the way I feel that
[1:16:53] God works with me I don't know about you
[1:16:55] but but I'd be sitting there and when my
[1:16:58] growth would happen right there where
[1:16:59] brother Donnie said that's where I sat
[1:17:00] the whole time when brother Dale was
[1:17:02] preaching well he would bring things out
[1:17:04] and I would have that moment of number
[1:17:05] one I need to work on that
[1:17:09] our number two thank you Lord because
[1:17:11] that part of me is gone
[1:17:14] see that's what we need to hone in on
[1:17:16] either one both
[1:17:17] is that have I got better with this or
[1:17:21] have I got worse with this have I got
[1:17:23] better has people been able to talk to
[1:17:26] me more
[1:17:29] and I have more knowledge not in the
[1:17:31] knowledge of the world but knowledge of
[1:17:32] the word of God
[1:17:34] [Applause]
[1:17:36] our virtue virtue is power strength
[1:17:39] listen
[1:17:41] and I know we have our little
[1:17:42] idiosyncrasies we have our little things
[1:17:43] that that that I
[1:17:46] my whole thing is is grapes your cheese
[1:17:50] some people just grate my cheese
[1:17:52] Pastor some people just grate my cheese
[1:17:55] I'm just I just called your name to say
[1:17:57] that I was not talking to you okay all
[1:18:00] righty then
[1:18:02] but still
[1:18:04] that's human nature
[1:18:06] but can you buy your Christian
[1:18:09] experience push that aside
[1:18:14] and not tolerate people
[1:18:17] but love them so much you want to be
[1:18:18] around them
[1:18:22] see as a as a as a as a um
[1:18:25] a sinner
[1:18:27] I didn't want to be around my dad
[1:18:29] because there was condemnation there
[1:18:32] right I mean you felt it I felt we all
[1:18:34] did not your daddy your your daddy who
[1:18:38] bro Tom you know it was one of them
[1:18:39] where you went way around you went 285.
[1:18:43] to get around brother Tom because you
[1:18:45] knew what was going to happen he wasn't
[1:18:47] going to harass you he was just going to
[1:18:49] tell you the truth
[1:18:50] and I didn't want the truth at that time
[1:18:53] because remember the Bible says the
[1:18:55] truth wasn't in me
[1:18:57] but there was a time when it's like you
[1:18:59] said before he said he said you're going
[1:19:02] you're coming you're coming
[1:19:06] but see The Virtue that was being put
[1:19:09] forth from him and from brotherdale and
[1:19:11] different ones that I didn't want to be
[1:19:13] around them because I didn't have that
[1:19:14] same virtue
[1:19:15] but now that I have that same virtue
[1:19:17] that I'm trying to do better trying to
[1:19:20] know trying to know that God is in
[1:19:22] brother Dale different ones that's why I
[1:19:24] have listen Chris long and all those
[1:19:26] people they're not just my friends
[1:19:29] we feed off each other
[1:19:31] hope is good
[1:19:33] right
[1:19:34] because I feel that Chris has virtue
[1:19:37] brother
[1:19:39] um Scott has a virtue brother
[1:19:42] um altique has virtue so I want to draw
[1:19:45] strength off of that I don't want to
[1:19:47] shun them and not be around them
[1:19:49] because whatever's inside of them
[1:19:51] supposed to be in me
[1:19:53] and we're supposed to what then that's
[1:19:55] it then that's virtue
[1:19:58] that is strength that has been able to
[1:20:00] draw strength you sisters some of you go
[1:20:03] through issues and problems and some of
[1:20:05] you already been through them
[1:20:07] all right
[1:20:09] like I said before you gonna go talk to
[1:20:11] the guy at the convenience store about
[1:20:12] your salvation
[1:20:15] no you're gonna find a sister in the
[1:20:17] church
[1:20:19] you're gonna find somebody to talk to
[1:20:21] that may and this is where one thing
[1:20:23] we've got to see that all of us are not
[1:20:25] strong
[1:20:27] all of us are just not strong at the
[1:20:29] same level
[1:20:30] right we're all in different even even
[1:20:32] men
[1:20:35] and sisters were all strong in certain
[1:20:38] points
[1:20:39] but let's start
[1:20:41] look compacting let's start putting that
[1:20:43] together though not separating it apart
[1:20:47] let's start putting it together and feed
[1:20:49] off of each other and you'll feel listen
[1:20:51] You'll Know real quick whether it's good
[1:20:54] food or bad food
[1:20:56] if that's what your desire is is to have
[1:20:58] good food I know like look at sister

[1:22:29] but where did she draw virtues she
[1:22:30] didn't draw version I'm not saying
[1:22:32] anything about anybody up in North
[1:22:33] Carolina where she lived where did she
[1:22:35] draw virtue from she drawed virtue from
[1:22:36] the ministry of brother Dale she'll tell
[1:22:38] you that
[1:22:39] okay so then that desire that deep
[1:22:43] Drew her here
[1:22:45] that deep not in deep of anything up
[1:22:47] that deep she wanted more deep teaching
[1:22:49] she wanted more she wanted more uh word
[1:22:52] than she was getting where she was at
[1:22:54] well she deserved then
[1:22:58] that she was it didn't matter the four
[1:23:01] hours that she drove one way
[1:23:03] because obviously folks if she drove
[1:23:05] four hours down here she's got to drive
[1:23:07] four back
[1:23:09] it wasn't a magical thing you drive four
[1:23:11] hours you flew back
[1:23:13] how many times sister how many times did
[1:23:15] you really break down on the side of the
[1:23:16] road I remember one time you finally the
[1:23:17] car uh blew up
[1:23:20] it had like 600 million thousand miles
[1:23:22] on it by Volvo
[1:23:25] we have one it'll get you where you're
[1:23:27] going
[1:23:28] you didn't have a flat tire I don't
[1:23:30] think at all did you no
[1:23:32] hold on people how many years was that
[1:23:36] 20 years
[1:23:41] at least 20 years okay let's just say 20
[1:23:44] years how many of y'all been 20 years
[1:23:45] without a without a flat tire
[1:23:50] oh but you didn't drive
[1:23:53] 220 miles one way every Sunday
[1:23:56] oh no set of tires in that car with that
[1:24:00] motor in that car and we live 10 minutes
[1:24:02] from I'm not going there y'all just know
[1:24:04] what I'm talking about
[1:24:06] but you know what she'll rise up
[1:24:10] and condemn this nation
[1:24:12] she'll condemn some of you
[1:24:16] for the desire that she had because she
[1:24:18] Drew virtue
[1:24:21] I mean listen think about it
[1:24:23] 20 years 220 miles one way 220 back
[1:24:28] every Sunday
[1:24:31] and have no car problems but one time
[1:24:34] the poor old thing finally kicked up and
[1:24:36] the motor blew
[1:24:39] didn't break down a Time on the side of
[1:24:41] the road isn't that kind of odd
[1:24:43] isn't that kind of almost miraculous
[1:24:45] and that kind of almost like brother
[1:24:47] like brother Lord the Lord Jesus was
[1:24:49] taking care of her
[1:24:52] oh she was never alone either yeah you
[1:24:54] had a pilot with you yeah
[1:24:56] but you understand what I'm saying I'm
[1:24:58] not trying to I'm not trying to shame
[1:24:59] you I'm letting her do it
[1:25:07] but she got to desire of her heart
[1:25:11] she's she's become a stronger Christian
[1:25:13] because of it
[1:25:16] miraculously like I said before
[1:25:18] you ask a truck driver
[1:25:21] if he's driven
[1:25:23] 440 miles
[1:25:25] just in one day one day
[1:25:28] and not had trouble with his car truck
[1:25:31] whatever and she had none except the one
[1:25:34] like I said one time the motor blew up
[1:25:35] had like 300 and some thousand miles on
[1:25:37] it finally he gave out listen we still
[1:25:39] live in this world things give out all
[1:25:41] right but look at the protection because
[1:25:43] she did what God honored her faith
[1:25:46] God honored that she wanted more of God
[1:25:49] she was that deep call came from right
[1:25:51] here
[1:25:52] came from this ministry here and then I
[1:25:55] believe that she's she well she asked
[1:25:57] sometimes she asked some questions that
[1:25:59] that that most preachers couldn't answer
[1:26:03] right
[1:26:04] she had not got knowledge
[1:26:07] at 85.
[1:26:09] you kids
[1:26:12] that's where you already get a lot of
[1:26:13] your knowledge from y'all not get it
[1:26:15] from somebody same age
[1:26:20] older
[1:26:21] because they've been there done that
[1:26:23] drove the miles
[1:26:25] been hurt
[1:26:26] been pushed been pulled
[1:26:29] scarred not wanting you to be scarred to
[1:26:32] be scarred
[1:26:34] well I don't know why okay
[1:26:37] I just wants to feel this we're not
[1:26:39] feeling
[1:26:40] these virtues
[1:26:42] we're just talking about them they're on
[1:26:43] a piece of paper or something brother
[1:26:45] Dale says you need to do
[1:26:46] that's not what it ought to be
[1:26:49] it ought to be where you live it
[1:26:51] it all debated where I can point to
[1:26:53] Sister Trudy and say she lived it
[1:26:55] Amen brother Dale he lived it
[1:26:58] I wanted what he was living I didn't
[1:26:59] want to be like Daddy I can't be like
[1:27:01] that don't y'all ever think I'll be like
[1:27:03] him he's an individual as far as a human
[1:27:05] but I want what he had because you know
[1:27:07] what I wanted to be able to act the way
[1:27:09] that he acted
[1:27:12] all them guys in General Motors they'll
[1:27:14] tell you that didn't act no different
[1:27:15] here than he did down there
[1:27:19] and that's what they saw
[1:27:22] can they see that in me and you in our
[1:27:24] job workplace and all that
[1:27:26] well praise the Lord
[1:27:28] from whom the whole body fitly joined
[1:27:30] see that's what the shaking is this
[1:27:31] church needs to be shook
[1:27:34] all of us need to be shook because you
[1:27:36] know what shaking does
[1:27:40] shaking will get you compacted it'll get
[1:27:43] you where all the air comes out of that
[1:27:48] the whole body fitly joined
[1:27:50] and compacted
[1:27:52] by that which every joint supplies
[1:27:55] according to effectual working in the
[1:27:56] measure of every part makes it increase
[1:27:58] the body into the edifying of itself in
[1:28:00] love have you ever looked at the body of
[1:28:02] different things I may not get to all
[1:28:04] this but we'll this this is good enough
[1:28:05] for me
[1:28:06] you know we as human beings our bodies
[1:28:09] built to stand upright
[1:28:12] everybody with me our body's not built
[1:28:14] to crawl now we start crawling but our
[1:28:17] bodies made to stand upright all of our
[1:28:20] can you imagine how many how much
[1:28:22] pressure is on your ankle bones right
[1:28:24] now
[1:28:25] especially mine
[1:28:27] you don't have to laugh you skinny
[1:28:28] people
[1:28:31] Godly jealousy
[1:28:33] but really it but God made those things
[1:28:36] just right
[1:28:38] to where they'll handle your weight and
[1:28:40] if you even move over to this side or
[1:28:42] move over to this side you're still
[1:28:43] standing up
[1:28:45] your low your toe muscles ain't much
[1:28:47] bigger than than this right here than a
[1:28:49] pencil
[1:28:50] but that's your structure that keeps you
[1:28:52] standing upright
[1:28:55] wow
[1:28:56] and you take something like a deer
[1:28:59] a deer doesn't see we do like this
[1:29:02] a deer's reverse
[1:29:04] his knees go down first
[1:29:06] so you know what God did
[1:29:08] God give him some really strong hand
[1:29:10] muscles
[1:29:12] that he Springs up when he when
[1:29:14] something comes like when you scare a
[1:29:16] deer he don't get up like we do
[1:29:18] he gets up from the back first and then
[1:29:20] he when he does he Springs forward
[1:29:22] because his arms see we can't even do
[1:29:24] that because his elbows bend the other
[1:29:26] direction but that was he was made for
[1:29:28] that that was made for him to be in
[1:29:29] Flight real fast to get out of the way
[1:29:31] to get out of the danger
[1:29:33] and you know for one thing you know how
[1:29:35] a deer jumps and can jump like eight ten
[1:29:37] feet and I mean they're jumping I mean
[1:29:38] they're it don't bother him a bit do you
[1:29:40] know their front legs are not even
[1:29:42] attached to their skeletal body
[1:29:45] rap bro
[1:29:48] you skin a deer out and you cut his arms
[1:29:50] off all you do is cut the meat off and
[1:29:52] you're done he didn't is like see we're
[1:29:53] connected all of our skeletons we're
[1:29:55] connected together but a deer's not
[1:29:57] because if it was he'd break his
[1:29:58] shoulder every time he'd jump
[1:30:00] so God made him with shock absorbers
[1:30:03] to where his to wear his bones would
[1:30:06] never break
[1:30:07] no matter how much pressure he puts on
[1:30:10] it while he jumps and jumps away from
[1:30:11] danger
[1:30:12] what are you saying by the way God built
[1:30:14] this body right
[1:30:16] God's going to build his body of
[1:30:18] Believers right he's going to have the
[1:30:20] right kind of people it doesn't matter
[1:30:22] if that little bone you know they always
[1:30:23] say if you get your big toe cut off that
[1:30:25] you lose your balance
[1:30:27] that thing ain't but about well some may
[1:30:29] be way bigger than that but
[1:30:30] but your big toes only about like this
[1:30:34] but if you get cut it off it affects
[1:30:36] your whole body affects your whole
[1:30:37] balance same way with me and you when
[1:30:39] some of y'all are not in church when
[1:30:41] some of y'all are going through
[1:30:42] struggles it hurts the whole body
[1:30:45] it hurts
[1:30:47] it hurts brother Dale and the different
[1:30:48] ministers not having to get on to you
[1:30:51] for the things you do
[1:30:52] it hurts us it's not something we we're
[1:30:54] not sadists we don't love it
[1:30:57] we hate it
[1:30:58] because we know the devil's involved
[1:31:01] and we always don't like that guy
[1:31:04] but we love the body of Christ which
[1:31:07] every joint supplies according to the
[1:31:08] facial work in the measure of every part
[1:31:10] making increase of the body what
[1:31:12] edifying it in love
[1:31:15] that word compacted is as we were
[1:31:17] talking about this morning to knit
[1:31:18] together
[1:31:19] to cause to do that word right there
[1:31:21] which is joined together put together
[1:31:23] unite or knit together in affection
[1:31:25] to cause a person to unite with one in a
[1:31:27] conclusion or come to the same opinion
[1:31:30] to prove demonstrate to teach and
[1:31:32] instruct
[1:31:34] that's what we've been doing
[1:31:37] we've been teaching you
[1:31:39] could tolerate
[1:31:42] the devil
[1:31:44] he's going to be there
[1:31:47] Temperance is self-control if you didn't
[1:31:50] have a contrast there would be no
[1:31:52] temperance
[1:31:53] think about that
[1:31:55] because why would you need temperance
[1:31:59] if it was all God
[1:32:02] you need Temperance because there's a
[1:32:04] devil there
[1:32:06] and it's opposition
[1:32:10] now I know sometimes we get mad at
[1:32:11] ourselves but boy how many times you get
[1:32:13] mad at yourself or get mad at somebody
[1:32:14] else
[1:32:16] oh yeah it's always somebody else's
[1:32:18] fault
[1:32:20] and it's his problem or hers they
[1:32:23] started it
[1:32:25] they caused me to get mad no they did
[1:32:29] not cause you to get mad you cause
[1:32:30] yourself to get mad
[1:32:34] but Lord help me with self-control
[1:32:37] me you and all of us
[1:32:39] to control the things that we can
[1:32:42] control him if you can't control it
[1:32:43] guess what give it to God
[1:32:45] Hannah's quitting smoking and I
[1:32:47] appreciate all of you on what's out
[1:32:48] there praying for
[1:32:50] that finally she's come to a place to
[1:32:53] where she might be sick and tired of
[1:32:54] being sick and tired all right
[1:32:57] but she had to come to a place that she
[1:32:59] didn't want to do that anymore but I'm
[1:33:01] telling you it's been Hell on Wheels
[1:33:03] she's had diarrhea she's been throwing
[1:33:05] up she can't eat she can't sleep why her
[1:33:08] body was so used to that and that demon
[1:33:11] of smoking was just so happy he loves
[1:33:14] for you and I said yesterday no day four
[1:33:17] yesterday she was sitting eaten and I
[1:33:19] said how you doing I walked by I said
[1:33:20] how you doing I just looked at her like
[1:33:22] that she had food all in her mouth she
[1:33:25] said this is good
[1:33:26] she said I can taste my food now right
[1:33:29] some of you that smoked you know that it
[1:33:31] kills your taste buds
[1:33:34] why would you want to smoke I like to
[1:33:36] eat and taste my food but she said man
[1:33:39] this guy so you look you see that even
[1:33:41] even though I know there's something
[1:33:43] calling inside of her but she's not a
[1:33:45] Christian but there is a something for
[1:33:47] her wanting to do better
[1:33:50] what are you saying brother wait he
[1:33:55] [Applause]
[1:34:02] I don't like myself for some of the
[1:34:04] things I do you shouldn't like yourself
[1:34:06] either
[1:34:08] but that's the ones you want to get rid
[1:34:09] of
[1:34:11] then you want people to realize it
[1:34:15] we realize now that Hannah's not smoking
[1:34:18] she does not smell like smoke
[1:34:21] she don't have a pack of cigarettes
[1:34:22] laying all over the place
[1:34:25] what she's changed
[1:34:29] he said well I don't smoke there's
[1:34:31] something on your list that you need to
[1:34:33] quit doing
[1:34:34] that I need to quit doing all right
[1:34:38] so those of you that don't pray for us
[1:34:39] that do
[1:34:41] amen give you something to pray about
[1:34:43] since you're perfect
[1:34:48] praise the Lord
[1:34:49] but we all have our thing and and to me
[1:34:52] that's what I was trying to think about
[1:34:54] how to approach this and I'm not getting
[1:34:55] the patience
[1:34:57] but trying to approach it in a way that
[1:34:59] that that when we preach it
[1:35:02] well you know and and let me give you an
[1:35:04] example
[1:35:05] brother Dale in 1982. bear with me just
[1:35:08] a minute brother Dale in 1982 preached
[1:35:10] on the seals
[1:35:12] to me that's the greatest revelation of
[1:35:13] the Seven Seals that's ever been since
[1:35:15] brother Brown came on here
[1:35:18] man
[1:35:21] it's 67 tapes that you
[1:35:23] and two if you don't we've got them
[1:35:25] somewhere
[1:35:26] that was in 1982.
[1:35:29] now listen the world wasn't ready for it
[1:35:33] the Believers in the message were not
[1:35:35] ready for him
[1:35:37] not at that time it was a different time
[1:35:39] but God revealed them to him
[1:35:42] so that he could
[1:35:44] build us all a base
[1:35:47] so that we can
[1:35:48] know what we're talking about that we
[1:35:50] can know that the seals
[1:35:52] is not just a white horse rider the red
[1:35:53] horse rider and the black horse rider
[1:35:55] and the fifth seals to the Jews and the
[1:35:58] six seals to the two witnesses and
[1:35:59] seventh seals nice to me and you
[1:36:02] why would the seals be opened by a
[1:36:04] gentile Prophet if it wasn't for a
[1:36:05] gentile Church
[1:36:07] amen
[1:36:08] and they were open
[1:36:10] so in 1982 he preached them okay so they
[1:36:13] went out
[1:36:16] because I'm gonna read you this right
[1:36:17] here second talk about patience and then
[1:36:20] we'll talk talk about it later
[1:36:23] he had patience
[1:36:26] because a lot of people would have
[1:36:29] maybe preached those and said well bless
[1:36:31] God don't buy under nobody wanted to
[1:36:33] know here nobody understood nobody
[1:36:34] wanted to you know there was no response
[1:36:36] it's just always flat and uh maybe it
[1:36:39] wasn't of God maybe you know this and
[1:36:41] that and the other and we put all of our
[1:36:43] whatevers into it
[1:36:45] but God left it there
[1:36:49] and then he
[1:36:52] he brother Dale moved on started
[1:36:54] preaching other things that was 1982
[1:36:56] folks how many of y'all were even born
[1:36:57] in 1982. some of you weren't even here
[1:37:01] boy don't raise your hand you wouldn't
[1:37:02] hear nothing you'd hear knocking these
[1:37:03] two I mean on the Earth
[1:37:06] ain't talking about in this church
[1:37:09] boys like
[1:37:14] pray for patience Janet Janet probably
[1:37:16] well nevermind I ain't gonna talk about
[1:37:18] age all right
[1:37:20] so
[1:37:24] and this is how God works and that's the
[1:37:26] way he works with me and you not just
[1:37:27] put the seals in there not just bringing
[1:37:30] out the Revelation but your life
[1:37:33] there's certain things that you do and
[1:37:35] you say man God I wish everybody could
[1:37:38] see this that's what brother they'll
[1:37:39] wish everybody could see what he saw in
[1:37:41] 1982 but it wasn't time
[1:37:44] it wasn't time for that so he had what
[1:37:47] the characteristic of a man who has not
[1:37:49] swerved from his deliberate purpose and
[1:37:52] his loyalty to Faith and piety by even
[1:37:54] the greatest trials and sufferings
[1:37:56] patiently and steadfastly
[1:38:00] what if Peter said that's it I'm done if
[1:38:02] ain't listening to me I'm just going to
[1:38:03] quit
[1:38:04] that would have been 40
[1:38:06] four years ago
[1:38:10] from 1982 till now
[1:38:14] sorry Danny 41.
[1:38:17] look what we would have lost
[1:38:20] if he'd just said I ain't having
[1:38:21] patience with them
[1:38:23] if they didn't get it the first time I'm
[1:38:24] done with it
[1:38:26] no then about 1992 he preached them
[1:38:28] again
[1:38:30] somewhere in the 90s
[1:38:32] then in 2000 something he preached him
[1:38:35] again
[1:38:36] then just several years ago he preached
[1:38:38] on him again
[1:38:39] you know why for me and you
[1:38:42] he had patience
[1:38:44] he had patience that God was going to
[1:38:46] reveal it to a group of people that had
[1:38:47] not got there yet
[1:38:49] but he had patience that we'd get here
[1:38:51] and I believe we're here
[1:38:54] I believe we're here I believe we're
[1:38:55] able to hear it
[1:38:57] I believe we're able to not just hear it
[1:38:59] but respond to it and build from it
[1:39:02] steadfastness constancy endurance
[1:39:05] do you know that patience the word
[1:39:07] patience is not even in the Old
[1:39:09] Testament
[1:39:11] it doesn't begin until the New Testament
[1:39:14] look it up look in your concordance the
[1:39:17] word patience didn't show up until the
[1:39:18] New Testament wasn't in the Old
[1:39:20] Testament because without the Holy Ghost
[1:39:22] it's hard to have patience
[1:39:25] anybody with me Moses didn't have any
[1:39:27] did he
[1:39:29] David didn't have any did he you look at
[1:39:31] all them people that got impatient and
[1:39:34] did the wrong thing
[1:39:35] uh
[1:39:36] steadfast waiting for it I just put that
[1:39:39] waiting for what waiting for me
[1:39:42] waiting for you
[1:39:44] but now folks I'm telling you if you're
[1:39:46] waiting
[1:39:47] for the bus to pull up
[1:39:50] and you're at the bus station and you've
[1:39:52] got your ticket for the bus
[1:39:56] it will be there
[1:39:59] and you will get picked up
[1:40:03] so I know there's a story of not having
[1:40:04] the right ticket and be at the plant no
[1:40:07] there is a group of people that's going
[1:40:09] to buy the right ticket
[1:40:10] at the right time
[1:40:12] and that bus that they're supposed to
[1:40:14] get on is going to pull up
[1:40:17] and you're going to have your ticket
[1:40:18] ready
[1:40:19] oh my how many people have I mean flying
[1:40:22] now is just a I hate flying is I don't
[1:40:25] hate flying in the air
[1:40:27] it's the getting there getting through
[1:40:29] security
[1:40:30] huh
[1:40:36] same way with
[1:40:38] with us
[1:40:39] there's some things that we don't have
[1:40:40] patience for but it's worth something
[1:40:43] because
[1:40:44] I wouldn't want to get on an airplane
[1:40:45] now without having to go through TSA
[1:40:47] because there's a bunch of idiots out
[1:40:49] there that won't blow planes up still
[1:40:51] okay so I'll just uh I'll just endure
[1:40:54] that
[1:40:55] because actually the next thing we're
[1:40:58] going to talk about
[1:40:59] is
[1:41:00] patience is called endurance
[1:41:04] those who endure to the end shall be
[1:41:08] saved
[1:41:10] those who endure
[1:41:12] the Bible tells us
[1:41:16] followers of them who through faith and
[1:41:18] patience
[1:41:19] inherit the promises
[1:41:22] and we'll get to something read and
[1:41:23] we'll back up here in just a minute
[1:41:25] the trying of your faith worketh
[1:41:28] patience
[1:41:29] but let patience have her perfect work
[1:41:32] that you may be perfect and entire
[1:41:34] wanting nothing
[1:41:37] brother Brown said you're beginning to
[1:41:39] reflect the works of Christ we'll go
[1:41:40] through it real quick musicians come on
[1:41:43] right here it is right here this I want
[1:41:45] to read this right here now this is in
[1:41:47] Statue of perfect man listen
[1:41:49] brother Brown tells us he's talking
[1:41:51] about having patience but so many of us
[1:41:54] trying to do the works of Christ before
[1:41:56] the reflection of Christ is in US
[1:42:00] now there's the trouble
[1:42:02] we find these things happening
[1:42:05] you know it I know it we see these
[1:42:09] stumbles along the road we find the
[1:42:12] scrap heap of Ministers of Christians
[1:42:15] piled along the road is because they
[1:42:18] didn't go into it right
[1:42:23] we see these stumbles along the road
[1:42:27] we find the scrap heap of ministers
[1:42:29] what's he talking about we're on a path
[1:42:31] we're walking we're doing we're doing
[1:42:33] we're doing what God Said and then Here
[1:42:35] Comes somebody
[1:42:38] out past the will of God
[1:42:42] you finally meet him on the road and
[1:42:44] they're piled up racked on the side of
[1:42:46] the road because they didn't go
[1:42:48] according to God's plan we find the
[1:42:50] scrap heap of Ministers of Christians
[1:42:52] piled along the road is because they
[1:42:54] didn't go into it right and that's why
[1:42:57] I'm here this morning to try to teach
[1:42:59] this little church and myself how that
[1:43:01] we can become the dwelling place
[1:43:04] of the Living God how many would like to
[1:43:06] be that way let's stand to our feet The
[1:43:08] Dwelling Place
[1:43:09] of the Living God
[1:43:12] then he talks about us being
[1:43:14] long-suffering you know that's that all
[1:43:15] that and endure those who those who what
[1:43:17] those who endure to the end shall be
[1:43:20] saved
[1:43:22] well I can only make it so far well
[1:43:27] is that your confession
[1:43:29] no I confess I'll make it to the end
[1:43:33] I confess we all Buy
[1:43:37] growing in God
[1:43:39] we're going to make it and God give us a
[1:43:41] provision to grow you know man man has
[1:43:44] not come
[1:43:46] they're so close to God because their
[1:43:49] requirement of us to be as we were
[1:43:52] talking about electricians and and
[1:43:54] Elisha had to go to church I had to go
[1:43:55] to church had to go to school if you're
[1:43:57] if you have a degree today any kind of
[1:43:59] degree it's because you went to a school
[1:44:01] right
[1:44:04] right if you have a degree in anything
[1:44:06] some of you are trying to get one some
[1:44:08] of you are but is there not a
[1:44:09] requirement of things you got to do you
[1:44:11] just don't you just don't call on the
[1:44:13] phone and say hey I'd like a degree
[1:44:15] in electrical work and they send you one
[1:44:17] guess what you're gonna die
[1:44:20] I will anyway because I don't know
[1:44:22] what's hot and what's not and I'll grab
[1:44:24] both of them and I'll beat the 440 and
[1:44:26] get a body change
[1:44:28] but what did you do you went to school
[1:44:31] 12
[1:44:33] long
[1:44:34] years
[1:44:36] and then if you wanted to go further you
[1:44:39] had four
[1:44:41] two or four long years
[1:44:44] and if you want to be a doctor you can
[1:44:47] tack on about another four to six on top
[1:44:50] of that
[1:44:51] then you begin to be a doctor
[1:44:54] well that's what me and you have come to
[1:44:55] a place
[1:44:58] to be the PowerHouse of God we got to go
[1:45:00] through the curriculum we got to do what
[1:45:02] God told us to do we've got to become
[1:45:06] what brother Brown told us
[1:45:08] is a Powerhouse of God
[1:45:12] power without character though is
[1:45:15] satanic this is the character
[1:45:17] so power with this character we know how
[1:45:20] to handle Satan when he walks up we know
[1:45:22] how to handle God when he wants you to
[1:45:24] do something we know how to handle our
[1:45:25] neighbor we know how to handle
[1:45:27] everything
[1:45:28] you say oh I don't know if I can do it
[1:45:29] well that see you stopped yourself you
[1:45:31] become an unbeliever at that time
[1:45:33] I just believe I just believe that we
[1:45:35] can do it I just believe that we're
[1:45:37] going to do it somebody there's going to
[1:45:40] be somebody standing in time and say
[1:45:42] death I don't know who you are I know
[1:45:45] what you are and I know you have no
[1:45:47] power over me
[1:45:49] there's no funeral home there's no uh
[1:45:52] there's no um embalming fluid there's
[1:45:54] nothing that there's nothing on this
[1:45:56] Earth that's going to cause me to need
[1:45:58] you
[1:46:01] right
[1:46:02] well nobody said y'all get quiet
[1:46:06] well then I'll be doing your funeral
[1:46:09] one way or the other
[1:46:10] we can be happy about what God's give us
[1:46:13] to get out of here

[1:53:12] in God that wants us to fail
[1:53:15] he wants us to make it he's given us
[1:53:17] provision to make it you see all these
[1:53:20] uh you know sometimes you watch these
[1:53:22] survival shows well mankind tries to
[1:53:25] pick up this and make us you know take a
[1:53:28] stick make a bowl with it and and try to
[1:53:30] survive and that's not what God did he
[1:53:33] gave us the best
[1:53:35] to survive with he might want us to
[1:53:38] survive but he gave us a good
[1:53:42] tent
[1:53:43] to get in
[1:53:46] he gave us a good bible to read
[1:53:49] he gave us some good tapes to listen to
[1:53:51] and some good brothers and sisters to
[1:53:53] fellowship with
[1:53:55] I think the survival rate just went up
[1:53:58] hey man
[1:54:00] think of it that way don't think I'm
[1:54:01] just going to survive and just know the
[1:54:03] survival rate just went up every time
[1:54:05] you you get a little something extra
[1:54:06] from God the survival rate just keeps
[1:54:08] going up keeps going up
[1:54:11] I hope I didn't make anybody mad sister
[1:54:14] Trudy uh she's she would not ever think
[1:54:17] that I was trying to pick on her but
[1:54:19] she's an example
[1:54:21] she's an example that a lot of us are
[1:54:22] not
[1:54:23] and you know what examples do examples
[1:54:25] examples make me want more makes me
[1:54:28] strive more to that if if if she can do
[1:54:31] it I can do it
[1:54:33] if a lady single lady by herself can
[1:54:37] drive four hours to listen to uh you
[1:54:41] know maybe
[1:54:43] four hours of preaching three and a half
[1:54:45] hours of preaching back then
[1:54:47] and then turn around and go back home it
[1:54:49] wasn't like a whole day thing I mean
[1:54:51] turn around go back on
[1:54:54] God honored that you know why she didn't
[1:54:56] do it because well I'm going to do this
[1:54:58] because I want to I want to impress
[1:55:00] brother down that's not why she did that
[1:55:02] she did it because she wanted to hear
[1:55:04] from the word of God
[1:55:05] she wanted to hear
[1:55:08] and Faith cometh by what hearing and
[1:55:11] hearing by the word of God God put
[1:55:14] examples of people in all of our lives
[1:55:16] every one of us
[1:55:17] to either learn the good or the bad all
[1:55:20] right well she's been wanting to show
[1:55:22] the good and to condemn us that that
[1:55:24] that are a little slack sometimes she
[1:55:27] never was Slack
[1:55:28] and you know why because she had a
[1:55:30] desire in her heart to do better
[1:55:33] do we have a desire
[1:55:35] to do better I have a desire to be a
[1:55:37] better Christian if that's not inside of
[1:55:39] you you need to hit this altar as fast
[1:55:41] as you can
[1:55:42] in fact desire that deep call is Lord I
[1:55:46] want more of you not more of this and
[1:55:48] more of the world or more more money or
[1:55:50] more cars or more I want more of God
[1:55:53] you know what God's got to do what he
[1:55:56] said
[1:55:57] there's one thing about God
[1:55:59] he's not slack the Bible says according
[1:56:01] to his promises in other words we might
[1:56:03] be a little slack I may tell Deanna back

[1:56:23] something could happen and I need to do
[1:56:26] something else so I have to break that
[1:56:28] promise

[1:56:31] God's mouth
[1:56:33] that he was not able to keep and he will
[1:56:36] keep it so that's the God we got to
