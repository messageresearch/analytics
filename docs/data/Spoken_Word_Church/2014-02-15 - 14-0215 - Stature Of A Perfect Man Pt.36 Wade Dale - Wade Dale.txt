TRANSCRIPT
========================================
i want to do this because we keep putting everything over here and i'm over here and when i'm talking and you're looking at the video camera i'm pointing over there and nobody's seeing over there so we don't have split cameras down here like they're downstairs when they bring quotes up so i want you to see the quote part anyway so let's turn to second peter let's read or we were starting there or bless you good to have our visitor with us which he's not a visitor anymore just one of us mr margaret brother anderson mama so that's his mom right there so if you have anything to say about him you better tell her she's here and i promise you it'll be a very short list like zero confusing good good she's you know what last night she said thanks for loving him cause we're out here she he doesn't have a mommy to cook for him every day when he's skinny that's what bob's dad always tells me he said brother and brother said love my family yes and thank god for loving yep all right patience now we're going to read 2nd peter 1 and we're now on patience patience is a what patience is a virtue come on work happy jeremiah that's another perk mom can get i don't know i'm still with you when you're 50 years old right in front of her huh what's he doing oh okay that's fine didn't hurt anybody the computer one according as his divine nature have given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness so that's what we're talking about we're talking about life the life that we live and the godliness in our life through the knowledge of him that have called us to glory and virtue whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these you might be protected from the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust and besides this giving all diligence add to your faith virtue and the virtue knowledge the knowledge temperance and tempers patience the patience godliness so now we are on patience just kind of re reviewing a little bit now that i got this on my ipad i can that makes you agree everybody all right this is what i like here steadfastness constancy constant endurance in the new testament the characteristics of a man remember the word patience is not even mentioned in the old testament the first word patience uses in like the book of matthew so it's a hard thing to have it was hard for for moses he had patience but but this we're talking about godly patients from the new birth something coming from the inside and working its way out but in the new testament the characteristics of a man who has not swerved from his deliberate purpose and his loyalty to faith and piety by even the greatest trials and sufferings because remember tribulation work it patience if you don't if everything goes along just smooth and hunky-dory all the time what would you need patience for so i said about faith you're not gonna need faith over in glory you're going to be faith but we need faith now because we have to believe something we can't see but when we can see it i don't need faith that june is is going to come to church and be born again she's already there i don't have to have faith for that i have to have faith with my kids because they're not come to that point so we got to have faith for patience and when it comes guess what you add that to then you go again you add that to we were talking last sunday about tribulation tribulation working because if you start into a trial you start into a trial and you backslide and go out in the world or whatever you're going to do then you know one thing's for sure you're not steadfast you're not constant you're not enduring paul said i run this race he was going to run it to win he wasn't going running just just to just to get to the halfway point he run the race with what patience that's what we must have is patience even in our even in our trials look at noah we were using some examples last sunday look at noah noah preached 120 years the same message now he didn't say the same thing over and over again but his message was it's going to rain you need to get make a provision get in this ark get in this do this um you know know god for 120 years well none of us even even live 120 years but he preached for 120 years then when god put him in the ark it did instantly start raining it was seven more days that he had to sit in that steamy stinky ark with all them animals before one drop of rain ever fell so noah had to have patience he was steadfast i'm sure his kids as the prophet said his kids will say daddy you sure he said it'll rain it will rain you know why because noah got a revelation from god that's the difference when you get a revelation you can stand on abraham got a revelation that he was going to have a child brother brown said it was like he already had a child that's what you and i must have faith he said well i don't see anything well abraham didn't see nothing and as his years got longer and older it looked worse but the bible says he work stronger in faith in other words when he got to where he knew he couldn't do it himself see that's when god took over that's what we were talking about somebody will talk the other day about persecution and things um why are we we're not persecuted yet so the bible says there's ease in zion and that's what it is we just so easy till um the persecution is going to have to drive us or pull us into waiting on god and being perseverant persevere all right the next one there's another one here it's from the greek word be of long spirit not to lose heart that's what our problem is we lose heart sometimes because god doesn't bring it to us right then we do well that means we're impatient not patient we're impatient now the first thing brother brown i'm going to read you a quote today the first thing he said to do was be patient with who god not with yourself not with your neighbor no your mom dad wife he said be patient with god because that's the first man you better be patient with sure right right that's the first person you better be patient with because remember brother brown preached a message running without a message that's why he said power without character satanic we've got the power we've got the power of the word that no one on the face of the earth except jesus christ himself had and listen let me make this statement even jesus jesus had the power but it wasn't for only him to give out so he only had three and a half years he didn't have 50 years 60 years 80 years he had three and a half years to preach three and a half years that's all of the most powerful message but you and i have been given an opportunity 30 40 years what are we doing with it like i said last sunday you got people being a message 30 40 years and you go preach for them or or you make a statement they look at you like where'd you get that at that shouldn't be our lives should be encompassed with the message we should we should be able to if somebody talks about logos or theophany or or genesis 1 26 and i know there's other things that needs to be revealed of all these things but at least we should have a general knowledge that we need to be born again and then these virtues have to be birthed into our life then we have to come to the faith of the fathers then we have to come to the headstone before there's even a change people preach the change of the body just like it's just like it's a you know it's like it's just you know it's just well it's just a change of the body this is just chapstick well there was a process to get this chapstick it wasn't born inside this tube man had to put the chemicals together he had to put all these things together he had to manufacture the cube he had to get this stuff in it before it became chapstick same way with the message the message is not just given just to say well one day the body is going to be changed i don't believe that i believe there's a step brother brown said god had a plan and a purpose well you know what a plan and a purpose is you sit down and you map out what you're going to do that's a plan and the purpose was is he was going to have me and you become into the image of god that's true power without character is satanic power is the new verb in your birth but then you have to come up with that what's without you that's correct because you look at you take examples of i was reading it the other day where peter paul had a contention with peter paul had a contention with barnabas they were all born again people peter was had all these virtues in his life but yet he had a problem because paul had to call him down on something we still have that human nature that we have to deal with all right and brother brown talked about the the uh the preacher that they said i'm not preaching anymore i'm just gonna go get some beer and just you know in other words well you know brother brown never called him lost he said god took his son home so he wouldn't marry his name that he got a devil on him he got a devil on him and that devil drove him to do that but yet he was still born again because remember we have that dualness we have the spirit of ourself and we have the the uh i like what brother ulti said one time and it really it really strikes if you'll listen to what he was saying listen with some understanding he said the soul is telling you one thing but that spirit lays so close to that soul till it filters it filters through that spirit and it gets deluded because if you're born again why don't we still do things wrong or bad or i'm not talking about if you do things you don't commit adultery then i would assume you do it two or three times you lost you know you understand what i'm saying so you're lost uh if you keep doing something you're not supposed to do and forgive me lord only works maybe one or two times uh forgive me lord don't worry you know well i smoked that cigarette yesterday well forgive me lord then two weeks later i smoked another cigarette forgive me lord i smoke no don't forget that don't work you're lost you're born again all right but now when we're talking about these we're talking about a born-again person but that memory reason conscious and affection lays so close to that soul till it filters or dilutes what god says remember brother brown said he's flu your food can't stop that right look at abraham i mean i mean look at adam adam was a uh if you would say anybody had a pure mind adam had a pure mind right adam didn't have the the cares of the world and he didn't have a job to worry about and he didn't have at that time a bunch of kids to worry about it was just him and his wife would he do as a son of god as a as a being a representative of christ on earth what'd he do sold the whole human race out we put it all on eve but adam's the one that sold us out and i know what he did he sold us out for because of love but he still sold us out he still took his wife back that he'd been with the beast now that would be kind of hard for us to do you understand what i'm saying but patience have long be long suffering i think this is a lot of our problem is is that we're not patient but i promise you one thing when god knocks all the props out and he says i'm going to do something then that's when you've got to have patience with god that's what abraham did abraham could produce with hagar he could produce an ishmael so in other words let's be plain he could sexually reproduce even when he was 70 but as he got closer to the 99 he knew he couldn't and he knew sarah was dead before her woman was dead before when they first got married because they never had children so it come to the very total impossibility that one day abraham just said i just believe he said the whole time he said god i obviously i can't produce this you're gonna have to come on the scene and do it well that's exactly what you and i are gonna have to do is we're gonna say god we can't produce this there's no way we can we can you know amass enough money and people want to start putting up this and putting up silver and gold and i was reading an article yesterday and uh not yesterday day four yesterday in the on the internet that within 25 years gold may be worthless because man will be able to almost reproduce gold and it will make true real gold almost worthless in 25 years so what are you going to do with that well god's going to put them on the streets and we're going to walk on them but man kills each other for it and we're going to you know that's what remember the old saying about peter you know you come up to the come up to the uh to the gate or the man come up to the gate and peter said what do you got and he said oh my god he brought a bag of gold with him when he died and peter said oh you brought pavement well that's what it is i mean god gold is pavement yeah you know something to walk on but we but see what god's doing he's letting man break into god's laboratory he's letting man try to reproduce something to make us live longer to make us do this sorry we're all dying we're all getting older we all proven that every day of our life so let's have patience let's persevere even paul the great apostle paul the great ones back then peter i think they longed to see the coming of the lord but remember it was revealed to paul that the lord wasn't coming in this time it was revealed to him so paul knew that he had to run a race with patients preaching every service knowing that he was going to go by the grave he wasn't going to see the resurrection while he was still alive right yeah right he had a revelation remember that brother brown said that he was he remember the other the two brothers i can't remember their name but they were preaching that the resurrection was passed and they got uh cephas or not one secret but somebody else but they were preaching that that the resurrection had passed well who'd they get it from they got it from paul because paul gets up and he preaches a resurrection in christ they took it as a literal resurrection and he had to condemn it he said no don't it's not going to happen now put that away don't do that like brother branham when the seals were open he said go on with the same simple message this is not even for you this is the lord just gone from me this is for another generation well what patience did that man have for two more years he preached his heart out knowing that nobody was getting it sitting where he was preaching but he knew he had patience that a future generation was going to come up that was going to take what he said and sweep it on to the coming of the lord so he had patience i've always wondered you know you being a minister and i think i'm preaching now instead of doing something but as a minister you you want to think when you preach to 100 people that at least 99 get it that's being optimistic but having patience you know that only about 20 is going to get it hoping that the other 80 god will deal with your heart and you understand what i'm saying think about brother brown i'm preaching to hundreds and thousands and he knew by their spirit they weren't getting it he knew by their spirit they were there asked brother george canada well none of him but asked joseph to tell you what brother george said about going to the services brother mode even they testified we went to see the signs and wonders didn't even didn't even matter what was being said i'm sure they shouted and praised the lord and said brother ram has a good message waiting for the signs and wonders to come right they were looking at the signs and wonders they didn't see the message so brother brown knew they weren't seeing the message that's why that's why the uh angel of the lord said said brother around quit explaining it quit trying to explain that you know what i believe he was saying look this is the bait on the hook but this is not your message right right it's a bait on the hook but it's not your message this is not your message don't quit trying to teach the pentecostal babies supernatural things he was wanting to get into a supernatural realm well what about patience that's what i'm talking about patience brother branham i didn't just quit if if the lord revealed to me in 1963 that nobody's going to get this message nobody's going to get it you're going to preach it it's going to be on tape but another group is going to get it what patience that made that man get up every day and do the same thing he preached just as hard after 63 as he did before 63. so it didn't it bothered him in his humanity but he had patience he endured until god got finished with him and then he knew that he was going to have to go because the great one jesus christ was going to take over so i think brother brown knew that he had to plant those seeds or that scene right that the uh fightful ministry would take that crop and feed us now well he read the scripture just like we do it didn't say one messenger was going to do it all said you had to have a five-fold ministry to perfect the same well now he was a prophet you go over there to revelations 10 7 when the book was taken out of the hand it wasn't taken out of the seventh angel messenger's hand read it john took the book out of the angel's hand that came down and put one foot on went on see who was that christ brother branham was injected in there as the introducer to take christ and you john being the top of the bride take you and christ and bring the two together just like he took the olive the tree off of the oneness and took the tree off the trinity put them together and grew into a big tree well that's what he was doing he was taking revelations 10 7 is interjected showing that there had become a messenger to reveal christ to john and then john went and took the book out of the hand of the angel he didn't take the book out of brother brown's hand which took it from the angel now we know that you got to put the two together we would have never got it but john took the book from the angel so you brother brown can't give you a revelation right he can't brother brown cannot give you i can't give you a revelation brother dale can't give you a revelation he can try his best to get you in a channel to where god can give you a revelation of starring after food that's correct that's that's what he was doing he was storing up the food knowing that he would not have to be the one to eat it he was pouring out food for future generations which is here and we're not going to get to our test all right luke 21 17 and you shall be hated of all men for my name's sake there shall not a hair of your head perish in your patience possess you your souls romans 5 1 therefore being justified by faith we have peace with god through our lord jesus christ by whom also we have access by faith so their faith at the bottom of the pyramid exact as accessed into this grace wherein we stand and rejoice in hope of the glory of god and not only so but we glory in tribulation also knowing the tribulation work of patience and patience experience and in spirit experience hope hebrews 6 and we desire that every one of you to show the same diligence to the full assurance of hope under what unto the end so there we go we talk enduring but you be not slow for the followers of them who through faith and patience inherit the promise through faith and patience inherit the promise but when god made promise to abraham because he could swear by no greater he swore swear by himself saying surely blessing i will bless thee and multiply we'll multiply them and so after he had patiently endured god didn't just give him the baby right off he patiently endured for 25 years of of troubles and moving around and and i'm sure heart aches because he was a uh he was a man he wasn't anything real special he just believed god hebrews wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witness us lay aside every weight and sin which does so easily beset us and let us run with patience the race that is set before us james one my brother encountered all joy when you fall into many temptations county joy thank you lord that this is falling apart that's kind of contrary to what we kind of contrary to what we want but but look knowing this knowing this now look my brethren he's talking to somebody count it all joy when you follow in many temptations knowing this see now you gotta if you know it if you have a revelation you'll see that the trying of your faith working patience that's what he's telling the brethren he said knowing this that the trying of your faith work is patience but let patience have a perfect work that you may be perfect and entire wanting nothing james 5 be patient therefore brethren under the coming of the lord behold the husband waited for the precious fruit of the earth and have long patience for it until he received the early reign be all so patient establish your heart for the coming of the lord draweth night two thousand two thousand years ago when james wrote that that was two thousand years ago be patient establish your heart for the coming of the lord draw nigh wow grudge not one against another brethren lest ye be condemned behold the judge standeth before the door take my brethren the prophets who have spoken in the name of the lord for an example of suffering affliction and a patience behold we count them happy which endure you have heard of the patience of job but have seen the end of the lord that the lord is very pitiful and of tender mercy now brother branham here we read that one let me get over let's read right here fourthly you want to add patience to your faith if you got faith it worketh patience the bible says see so this is patience now that's the next thing going to build this statue you know god has got real material in his building see how short we are brethren sister see why where we're at yes sir see we have glory shouts and things because we've got faith because we got the new birth we have glory we shout we thank the lord hey you're eternal just as eternal as god is but god's not he's that's not what he wants all the time he wants us to grow up but when we come down to these things here god can't build us into that stature say he can't he can't no he can't you gotta let him right you gotta let him god's not gonna give you anything that you don't want he can't make us up to that kind of a place he said well that's contrary it's got to be god yeah it's god doing it but you got to allow it you've got to open the door we've got all these other things we fall slight off saying he can't build his church 223 patience with what what kind of patience first thing is have patience with god if you've got real genuine faith you'll have real genuine patience because faith worketh patience when god says anything you believe it that's all you've got patience say well i asked him last night to heal me i'm just a sick this morning oh my what patient god told abraham and 25 years later there wasn't even one sign he was still believing he was patient with god but he will always before you let him be the next crossing thing you can't cross him so just keep him before you he said so it's going to happen see keep him before you that's right noah had patience yeah noah had real godly patience god said i'm going to destroy this world with rain noah preached 120 years yet plenty of patience not even you fell from heaven wasn't nothing just as dusty as it ever was for 120 years but he was patient then god tries your patience that's right god tries them after he told noah now he said no i want you to go get in the ark i'm going to run the animals in i want you to get in climb way upstairs now so you can look out the top window i want you to get in there i want you to tell these people tomorrow what i've been preaching for 120 years is going to take place all right you go down and tell them now with nobody done i cut that out but you know what he done god shut the door and he had to wait seven more days before it began to rain now if we got it that way added but if you ain't got it that way don't try to add it it won't work see we're trying to work it up it won't work on healing it won't work on nothing else see it's got to blend in with the same material it's vulcanized too that's right got to add it patience with god's promise yes sir noah believed it and he had patience with god 125 years next sunday we'll start with moses let's go ahead and go and get upstairs where everybody else does lord bless you have a good week be careful
