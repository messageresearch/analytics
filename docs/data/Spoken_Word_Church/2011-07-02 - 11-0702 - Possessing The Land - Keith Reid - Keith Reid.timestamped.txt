[25:22] Open the Eyes of My Heart brother Keith
[25:23] Reed most of you know him from Jamaica
[25:26] as he comes to bring the word of the
[25:28] Lord unto us we pray that God will bless
[25:30] him and open our hearts and show us the
[25:32] day and the hour We're living because if
[25:34] it's not present tense gospel what good
[25:37] is it we can look backward we can look
[25:40] forward but if we don't look at what God
[25:42] is doing it's not helping us at all amen
[25:45] so let's just sing it and do it Open the
[25:48] Eyes of My
[25:51] Heart Open the Eyes of My
[25:55] Heart I want to see

[26:30] shining in the light of your

[26:38] sing Holy Holy Holy I lift it up high
[26:44] and lift it
[26:47] up shining in the light of your
[26:52] glory pour out your power
[26:56] anding holy holy
[27:03] holy holy holy
[27:07] holy holy holy
[27:12] holy holy holy holy I want to see
[27:21] you amen amen praise the Lord you may be
[27:24] seated just for a while certainly we
[27:27] want to thank God for this privilege of
[27:31] being in the house of God and to be
[27:34] gathered together with God's people amen
[27:36] amen to praise and to lift up the name
[27:39] of our God we thank God for our families
[27:43] and the extended family the church and I
[27:46] believe the Church of God has got to be
[27:48] a family unit together amen and for the
[27:52] Church of God to survive and to stay
[27:56] together as one it's got to be be like
[27:58] the way God laid it out in the book of
[28:01] Deuteronomy uh where God he said teach
[28:05] these things diligently diligently to
[28:08] your children amen when you go to your
[28:10] bed at night and when you get up in the
[28:12] morning and so when you teach that
[28:15] together then you stay together as a
[28:18] family you know we can say for these 40
[28:21] years uh I am certainly privileged to be
[28:25] standing in your midst of sibling
[28:28] and to see a church that has stand
[28:30] together for 40 years it's certainly a
[28:34] blessing and it certainly takes the
[28:36] glory of almighty God Amen you know many
[28:40] times we can say you know a church used
[28:43] to be over there a church used to meet
[28:46] in that building but where are they
[28:48] today and so it takes not just a
[28:51] friendship it takes a call from God and
[28:55] God positionally placing the people
[28:57] together as one under a unity and one
[29:02] thing as a people that we can never
[29:05] forget or we should never forget is that
[29:08] it takes a leader to keep the body of
[29:12] Christ together and um men who are
[29:17] anointed and called of God and elected
[29:21] to stand we'll certainly stand in these
[29:24] days amen because uh you know the said a
[29:28] people don't just leave the church they
[29:31] leave their Pastor right and and you
[29:33] you've got to believe that the Bible
[29:36] says remember them that as to rule over
[29:39] you was spoken to you the word of God
[29:42] Jesus Christ the same yesterday today
[29:45] and forever that we say the second part
[29:48] but we forget the first to remember them
[29:51] that as to rule over you which God has
[29:54] put in position tonight I I'd like i'
[29:57] like to speak more to the background of
[30:00] the unity of the church and then
[30:02] tomorrow I'd like to speak on the times
[30:06] that we're living in and to look at the
[30:09] Prophecies of the day that we're living
[30:11] in and what God is pointing us to for
[30:15] this day amen so we we just want to be
[30:18] real easy this this afternoon amen and
[30:21] just to look at some things of the
[30:22] family amen the family of God Amen and
[30:26] then tomorrow we move into another
[30:28] Direction but I certainly would like to
[30:30] greet you all from a church in Lindon
[30:34] Jamaica the spoken word Tabernacle and
[30:37] we say it's a church for the young of
[30:39] heart and so it doesn't mean if you're
[30:42] older you can't be there you just got to
[30:44] be young at heart amen praise God we we
[30:47] certainly love the Lord and I certainly
[30:50] thank God Amen there were years when I
[30:52] said I thought and I honestly thought
[30:55] that God had given me the hardest group
[30:58] of people to pastor and I would have
[31:00] said Lord I mean why did you give me
[31:03] these but I tell you as the years rule
[31:06] by certainly by the grace of God there's
[31:09] a lot of maturity amen and I would say I
[31:13] wouldn't exchange him for nobody amen
[31:16] praise God so we thank God for growth
[31:19] amen praise God and
[31:23] we we we certainly thank God for many
[31:26] who have left us over the years they've
[31:30] come back to the house of God and come
[31:33] back to the truth and um you know we we
[31:36] so got to be careful sometimes when
[31:39] people walk away from us how we treat
[31:41] them because uh you know they might even
[31:44] backslid in God but you they hold the
[31:46] foot until they come and um you know
[31:49] like the the prigal you know the father
[31:51] never was upset with the son because you
[31:54] had gone all these years but we're glad
[31:56] you're back and we're glad that God sent
[31:58] you because listen those who God has
[32:01] called they will come to the feet and
[32:03] they'll always be there there's nothing
[32:05] you can do to stop that and so we we
[32:08] want to have the best attitude to
[32:11] everybody and we want to treat everybody
[32:14] that they're going to make it in they're
[32:15] going to cross this Jordan into the
[32:17] promised land because we don't know who
[32:20] will and we don't know who won't and I'm
[32:22] going to waste my time to hammer those
[32:25] who won't go because I've got a message
[32:27] to preach those who will amen and so in
[32:30] the midst of preaching to those who will
[32:32] cross those who won't cross might just
[32:35] get on the number and cross over so it's
[32:38] not my position to divide amen I just
[32:41] feed the Bride of Jesus Christ with all
[32:45] the respect to realize that it is not my
[32:48] wife it is Christ's bride amen and what
[32:52] a glorious position to be in to be the
[32:54] friend of the bridegroom to be able to
[32:57] speak to the bride Hallelujah the glory
[33:00] of the bridegroom that she might comes
[33:02] into his image and what a day that will
[33:05] be when you're standing in the image of
[33:08] Jesus Christ Hallelujah pure and
[33:12] unadulterated by the word of God so we
[33:15] certainly thank God for amen the church

[33:22] that you have always been here and we've
[33:24] looked at I've looked at Brother Sam and

[33:32] the respect that we share with each
[33:35] other over the years you know they've
[33:37] never said to me brother Keith you ought
[33:39] to preach this and I've never challenged
[33:42] them on anything but I've respect them

[36:27] amen amen and
[36:29] amen in Deuteronomy 1 and verse
[36:35] 6 the Lord Our God spake unto us in
[36:38] herab saying you have dwelt long enough
[36:41] in this mountain turn ye and take your
[36:43] journey and go to the Mount of the
[36:46] amorites and unto the places nigh there
[36:49] unto the plains in the hills and in the
[36:52] veil and in the salt and by the seaside
[36:55] in the land of Canaan canites and onto
[36:57] Lebanon onto the Great River the river
[37:00] ephes behold I've have set the land
[37:03] before you go in and possess the land
[37:07] which the Lord swear unto your fathers
[37:10] Abraham Isaac and Jacob to give unto
[37:14] them and to their seed after them then
[37:18] we turn over to Deuteronomy chapter
[37:23] 6 and this beautiful verse
[37:31] that I love verse 6 it
[37:34] says and these words which I command
[37:37] thee this day shall be in thine heart
[37:41] and thou shalt teach them diligently to
[37:43] thy children and shall talk of them when
[37:46] thou sest in thy house and when thou
[37:49] west by the way and when thou liest down
[37:52] and when thou rise up and thou shal bind
[37:55] them for a sign upon thy hands and they
[37:59] shall be a fortlet before thine eyes may
[38:03] the Lord at his Blessing to the reading
[38:05] of the word you may be
[38:10] seated the book of
[38:14] deanime we find that
[38:18] God was going to do a new thing among
[38:21] his children right having taken them
[38:25] this 40 years
[38:27] through this
[38:29] Wilderness a long period of time and
[38:34] what an experience they had the things
[38:37] that they' seen but God now come to this
[38:40] position and I find that every time that
[38:43] God is going to do a new thing among his
[38:45] people the first thing that he does he
[38:48] remind them where he brought them from
[38:52] and the things that they had been
[38:53] through because God brought them to a
[38:56] bench Mark and then God tell them what
[39:00] he's going to do
[39:01] right and so here it is that Moses had
[39:06] brought them thus far 40 years oh yeah
[39:10] this long journey right amen and the
[39:12] family was together and they could have
[39:16] had Memorials of those that they walk
[39:19] out of Egypt with that they held hands
[39:22] and might be sing the songs of Zion yeah
[39:26] and had seen the travail of God's people
[39:30] and the things that they come upon the
[39:32] the Red Sea and the crying of the
[39:35] children they had a me heard how when
[39:38] they cried to God and and Moses mean
[39:41] went before the Lord and cried and God
[39:43] answered them amen and there was they
[39:46] could have uh remember amen the Red Sea
[39:50] and the Quil coming they could remember
[39:52] the bitter water and me turning sweet
[39:55] and and all this that God did to
[39:58] them but there was a
[40:01] purpose that God by Moses had commanded
[40:06] him to tell the children of Israel how
[40:09] you are to dwell yeah and in
[40:13] unity and as a communion of people God
[40:18] dwelt with them as a family and keep
[40:20] them together right right you know we
[40:24] focus of all God now telling them there
[40:28] in Deuteronomy
[40:30] 6 and thou shallal teach them diligently
[40:33] unto thy children because God believes
[40:37] that there is to be a
[40:40] continuation of what is
[40:43] started it should never be that yes we
[40:46] did that yesterday all the things and
[40:48] the glories that we had yesterday in the
[40:50] message but where is it today on we we
[40:54] no longer do it it's pass it's it's
[40:56] something of yester year right right yet
[40:59] Brethren God has dealt with us in this
[41:02] way where he's moving his children from
[41:05] Glory onto glory amen we're not at the
[41:09] same position we're not at the same
[41:12] place there's experiences that we've got
[41:15] but every time we get there God is doing
[41:18] something for us
[41:20] exactly kept them together as a
[41:24] unit the best way I can describe it as
[41:28] like the unity of a
[41:30] family teach it diligently to your
[41:33] children Glory you know brethren we find
[41:36] that where there is a strong family unit
[41:41] there's going to be a church that is
[41:44] together and let the family unit be
[41:47] dispersed and where is the church right
[41:50] amen the family is the germ of
[41:54] civilization and we are witnessing ing
[41:56] the debt of the family because mean of
[42:00] the changing of the culture of the
[42:02] people let us see is upon us that's
[42:06] right brother brandham what a time he
[42:10] was living in when he said it is not
[42:13] children delinquency but it is parents
[42:17] delinquency because the the parents have
[42:20] change the standard the morals are not
[42:23] the sameen theyve moved away from the
[42:26] arms and so it is upon their children
[42:30] amen yeah the family therefore is under
[42:33] major assault right amen so much so amen
[42:37] that the precept of yesterday it's hard
[42:40] to teach to your children but I bring
[42:43] you this this evening that God when he
[42:45] speak to Abraham and when God speak of
[42:48] him God said I know the man Abraham I
[42:52] know that he will lead his children
[42:54] after him that's what God wants amen and
[42:58] so that's how the Church of God am mean
[43:01] ought to stand am mean I take words from
[43:04] the message trying to do God's
[43:07] service he said this was Moses speaking
[43:10] to Israel after he had been Vindicated
[43:13] by God by a pillar of fire and know he
[43:16] was proven to be God's servant to lead
[43:19] them out and before they went into the
[43:22] land before they entered Moses said now
[43:25] the word that I SP have spoken unto you
[43:28] I call Heaven and Earth to witness
[43:31] against
[43:32] you if you had one thing to it or take
[43:36] one thing from it right Hallelujah
[43:40] you'll not stay in the land where the
[43:42] Lord your God give
[43:44] you what a command Glory if you had
[43:48] anything to it if you take anything from
[43:51] it in other words he was simply saying
[43:54] to them keep the word pure keep it
[44:00] unadulterated don't mix it with
[44:03] anything exactly yes sir Hallelujah you
[44:08] are the witness he said so say I in the
[44:13] name of the Lord Jesus don't you had one
[44:16] thing no brother brand him speaking to
[44:18] the church in just he said sa say I in
[44:22] the name of Jesus don't have what
[44:26] something to it right hallelujah amen
[44:29] can we say amen and we have heard that
[44:32] word we have heed that word don't take
[44:35] or put your own ideas in it
[44:40] amen
[44:41] hallelujah hallelujah it is still the
[44:45] same thanks be to God you just say what
[44:49] is said on those
[44:52] States you know Brethren we've gotten so
[44:54] intellectual where what is said on those
[44:57] States seem oldfashioned to many but we
[45:01] can say it's a power of God unto
[45:05] salvation it is a revealed word of God
[45:08] that can take us out of here and we're
[45:11] looking for anything
[45:12] else hallelujah we're satisfied he said
[45:16] you just do exactly what the Lord God
[45:19] has commanded you to do right don't had
[45:23] to it amen you notice the parallel of
[45:27] brother Bam's Ministry and Moses
[45:30] ministry that's right exactly is that
[45:32] Moses was simply saying to them he said
[45:35] listen he me God take you to record to
[45:39] the word of God that you have received
[45:41] that you should not add to it or you
[45:44] should not take from it and the things
[45:46] that was before them was the land of
[45:50] promise amen am yes we're going to
[45:53] possess this land but we're not going to
[45:56] the land the way we
[45:57] feel the way we like we're not going to
[46:01] possess the land because we're in the
[46:03] message we're not going to possess the
[46:05] land because we're in Lula we're going
[46:07] to possess the land because we've got
[46:10] the charge from God and we keeping forth
[46:13] on the word of God somebody said I know
[46:17] whom I've believed in and I'm persuaded
[46:20] that he's able to keep that which are
[46:23] committed unto him against
[46:26] day
[46:28] hallelujah
[46:30] hallelujah the family of God has got to
[46:33] be together right you know as we teach
[46:36] our children at home so the church ought
[46:39] to be in everything right I give you
[46:42] scriptures just for your remembrance not
[46:45] as though you don't know them Ephesians
[46:47] 6 and verse1 children obey your parents
[46:50] in the Lord for this is right right am a
[46:54] principle Exodus 2012 honor thy father
[46:58] and thy mother that thy days may be
[47:00] prolonged in the land which the Lord thy
[47:03] God giveth thee amen it was for the
[47:07] family unit and I tell you Brethren the
[47:09] blood is for the family hallelujah amen
[47:14] listen Masterpiece the message
[47:15] Masterpiece said notice the Great
[47:17] Masterpiece of the family the husband
[47:19] and wife cannot be truly a family unless
[47:23] they are one amen amen they have to be
[47:27] if they're not they're not a good family
[47:30] wife pulling one way and the husband
[47:33] pulling another way how many times you
[47:35] see that right that will make an awful
[47:38] family but in the agreement with love
[47:41] one another or with love one to the
[47:45] other that's a family and now amen that
[47:48] was God's Masterpiece and all the true
[47:51] family here portray that right and
[47:55] second the second second Adam second Eve
[47:58] ready now to return back to the home
[48:01] amen and the whole picture as been
[48:04] Redemption right from where it was
[48:07] bringing it back just exactly bringing
[48:10] it back together again it's got to be a
[48:13] unit together Brethren there's something
[48:16] about the church that makes a church
[48:19] United together as one there's got to be
[48:22] a spirit of care
[48:24] right
[48:26] I remember some years
[48:28] ago when I was just a young believer and
[48:31] I would be back home and you know I went
[48:34] to I'm I'm originally Baptist and you
[48:37] know I would have gone back to the
[48:38] people who have known when I was a child
[48:40] and you have been to the church and you
[48:42] know becoming a young Christian and you
[48:45] know I started preaching real early and
[48:47] you know the people knew me very well
[48:49] and you know they gave me the
[48:50] opportunity to preach and you know I
[48:51] used to go among them and preach and you
[48:53] know I remember they they started like a
[48:55] good good Revival in our area and
[48:58] different ones you know would have come
[48:59] out to the church and you know people
[49:02] from every walks of life were just
[49:03] coming to the church and you know the
[49:06] there was The Good The Bad and The
[49:08] indifferent and everybody was just
[49:09] coming you know I remember personally I
[49:12] remember when I was a childen there was
[49:14] this woman that was in our community and
[49:16] I was really afraid of her because when
[49:18] she walked on the street the words that
[49:20] come from her mouth I tell you I was
[49:22] literally afraid afraid of her and
[49:24] brother you know I this young Christian
[49:26] and I see her com into church and you
[49:28] know the next thing this was she came
[49:30] and she young me and she give me a big
[49:32] kiss and you know I stood there at the
[49:34] front and I see people coming and
[49:36] somebody said hey look who's coming
[49:39] where they think they're
[49:40] going they're going to the Church of God
[49:44] you know Brethren one thing we've got to
[49:46] realize the church right is not
[49:49] ours amen Lula don't belong to you it
[49:54] belongs to God Amen and Bren I tell you
[49:59] the indifferent is going to come but
[50:01] what are you going to do about it on it
[50:04] is not your call it's God's
[50:06] call hello somebody that the call of God
[50:11] for this assemble is greater than your
[50:15] life hello it is an experience that God
[50:19] is doing and you cannot do anything
[50:22] about it whether you like it or not
[50:26] but you're coming into the this
[50:28] experience that God is calling you to
[50:31] amen amen in this 40
[50:33] years where have we gone right you know
[50:36] Brethren I've looked at the transition
[50:39] of the house of God and you know years
[50:42] ago when I first came here you know
[50:45] there was all there was was might be
[50:47] just a little tape ministry that's all
[50:50] there was but I remember sitting with in
[50:53] cracker bell with Brother Sam one time
[50:55] we were on our way out and you know I
[50:57] was saying you you just I I just started
[51:00] going on the internet on the worldwide
[51:02] web yeah and you know I said to him I
[51:05] said Brother Sam I want you to remember
[51:07] one thing when you speak to your church
[51:11] sometimes I listen and you're speaking
[51:13] of the Affairs of what is happening in
[51:15] Lula but you've got to realize that
[51:17] there's a worldwide audience that is
[51:20] listening to you right and so we we
[51:23] we're in the times of
[51:26] transition where now we're seeing what
[51:29] God had really called us for and
[51:32] sometimes we've got to be careful that
[51:35] we don't he narrow our vision to these
[51:38] people who are sitting right here before
[51:40] us and the problems that brother dick
[51:43] have and the the problems that brother
[51:45] Wade have and the problem you see what
[51:46] I'm saying because Breen the call of God
[51:50] is beyond the house am
[51:53] right amen but yet many will not be able
[51:57] to make that
[52:00] transition because they trapped in a
[52:02] spasm of of the place that they are and
[52:06] they're not going any further that's
[52:08] right brother but Brethren when I see a
[52:10] church for 40 years when you started
[52:14] 1971 amen the aspiration that you've got
[52:17] today was not what you had back
[52:20] then what you had was you've heard the
[52:24] voice of a prophet
[52:26] and you believe that word and and there
[52:28] was something tugging on you to tell you
[52:31] that there's something greater GL than
[52:34] just we here and what we've got and
[52:36] we've got to progress with it I say to
[52:39] you challenge that with the vision that
[52:42] you've got today
[52:46] Amen brother the church is no longer
[52:50] just the four walls here right right and
[52:53] those that hear you but I challenge you
[52:56] this day but if from the word of God you
[53:00] start to hear then listen you don't just
[53:04] affect these that are listening to you
[53:06] brother then there's a challenge beyond
[53:09] what you understand right that is right
[53:11] there before you the way you walk is not
[53:15] just to you here right amen but there is
[53:18] a greater Horizon that is there on the
[53:22] outside that is listening to you amen
[53:26] exactly and
[53:28] so if the song leader takes the position
[53:34] light if the deacons take their position
[53:38] light part of the
[53:39] family then they don't understand that
[53:42] they're affecting the moving of the body
[53:45] of Jesus
[53:49] Christ you know as a
[53:52] pastor what gets me per terb sometimes
[53:57] is to see a song leader comes to church
[54:00] and he sit there at the front somewhere
[54:03] and start to flip through his song book
[54:05] try to find a song to
[54:09] sing and for the word to be delivered to
[54:13] the people I couldn't sleep last night
[54:16] yeah because there was something on my
[54:18] mind right amen and I saw the Lord and
[54:22] you get up and you look at the page and
[54:24] you go go back in the scripture you look
[54:26] back at your notes right and you said
[54:29] well that is important but you know to
[54:32] come and to sing the songs that's not
[54:34] important because we're just going to
[54:36] sing four songs and and we're going to
[54:38] take an offering and we're going to do
[54:39] this and then Brother Sam is going to
[54:41] come who is supposed to be prepared
[54:43] because if he ain't going if he's not
[54:45] prepared then we're going to say
[54:46] something about
[54:48] it yeah but then also the lady you're a
[54:52] part of the
[54:53] family and what was your experience
[54:57] yesterday what was your experience
[54:59] throughout the night did you think about
[55:02] it or is it just something that is going
[55:04] to happen tomorrow I'm going to be in
[55:07] church I'm going to he's going to find
[55:09] something to say to steal my
[55:12] spirit but whether I do or not I'm going
[55:15] to be in my
[55:17] position are you with me Bren we all now
[55:22] has reached a stage where we got to put
[55:24] our sh ERS to the
[55:27] whe we reach a position where the things
[55:30] of yesterday have got to go out because
[55:35] we're coming into the land of possession
[55:39] and youve got to step up to the plate
[55:41] they says step out on the plank amen and
[55:45] move on with the glory of
[55:48] God a
[55:50] family has got to be together glory amen
[55:55] amen
[55:57] hallelujah in the message unbelief and
[56:01] Fa and the faith and Faith
[56:05] mix Isaiah was the son of
[56:08] Ahab had been brought up in the kind of
[56:11] a home that was a lukewarm
[56:15] home it wasn't allog together Christian
[56:19] his mother was a Eden and his father had
[56:22] married out of Fellowship Mar woman that
[56:25] was not a Believer yeah and that always
[56:28] make a bad home for any kid to be raised
[56:32] in oh yeah that when unbelief and Fai
[56:36] ties tries to mix
[56:39] together and now if the father would
[56:42] have been a real strong man in his fate
[56:46] and the child might have been had a a
[56:49] better opportunity but he didn't he
[56:53] didn't have it he know know that there
[56:55] was God he know that there was a Jehovah
[56:59] amen and and that his mother's God and
[57:02] so forth was all confused then after the
[57:06] death of his father this boy in his
[57:10] condition kind of a mixup one way and
[57:13] another and if that ain't a picture of
[57:16] the lands today right one in the family
[57:21] is dis away and another and one another
[57:24] and
[57:25] and and one him me going this way and
[57:28] the other going that way no wonder we
[57:30] are producing so much juvenile
[57:33] delinquency right and all other kind of
[57:37] stuff under the name of Christianity and
[57:40] Breen when we speak of the children we
[57:43] speak of the body of Jesus
[57:45] Christ
[57:47] amen if the ministers if those who carry
[57:50] the word of God don't live the
[57:53] experience then what do you expect the
[57:57] people of God to be are you there with
[58:01] me right but yet every person need to
[58:03] realize that I've got a
[58:05] responsibility to the body of Jesus
[58:08] Christ you know I I tell them I say
[58:11] you've got a responsibility to those who
[58:13] are
[58:14] sick that you ought to live that God
[58:17] would hear your prayer amen for
[58:20] adventure they can't be healed right
[58:23] amen are you with me amen but the bre
[58:27] said it's because there is no
[58:30] Unity there is no real called out and a
[58:34] stand for God you Brethren it's easy
[58:38] even for a church to get lukewarm in
[58:41] their
[58:42] experience oh you've heard it and you've
[58:45] heard it and you've heard it and you've
[58:47] been to church and oh on Sunday morning

[58:52] whatever amen it becomes just a ritual
[58:55] to you and the people and being a part
[58:58] of your social group that you go because
[59:02] you got to meet so and so but the call
[59:06] and the conviction of the Holy Spirit
[59:10] you have lost it somewhere oh Brethren
[59:13] people of God I would to God we would
[59:16] have prayed so Lord let God this
[59:18] experience me because I want to
[59:21] socialize but because there's a burning

[1:02:23] and they would never show and their tags
[1:02:25] and their offering and they're giving to
[1:02:27] God but Brethren the personal experience
[1:02:30] with God is never there come on oh we
[1:02:34] serve God when we come together amen as

[1:05:44] the
[1:05:45] people

[1:05:51] be critical but when she gets a little
[1:05:55] whole she just he me swaps for her for a
[1:05:59] new model he's talking about a man
[1:06:01] putting away his wife it seems to be
[1:06:04] that way like swapping cars or something
[1:06:08] oh my it seems like it's that real
[1:06:10] family love don't exist much more just
[1:06:13] something has happened home life is

[1:06:28] talk about oh you know years ago what we
[1:06:30] used to do and years ago the experience
[1:06:32] that we used to have I challenge them on
[1:06:34] this one
[1:06:35] thing if the experience that they had
[1:06:38] back
[1:06:40] then and brought them closer to God than

[1:06:45] wrong with our Direction exactly amen
[1:06:48] are you there with me right I don't care
[1:06:50] if they used to pray all night I don't
[1:06:53] care what they see if this experience
[1:06:56] today doesn't bring us closer to God
[1:06:59] there's something wrong with us
[1:07:02] today because we're not getting in the
[1:07:04] rear view mirror we're going
[1:07:06] forward amen hallelujah amen so I don't
[1:07:10] believe in bashing the young and I ain't

[1:07:15] we progress with God we're going closer
[1:07:18] into the image of God Amen that's what I
[1:07:21] believe amen Dr about the neglect of
[1:07:24] love he said the world's looking for
[1:07:27] something
[1:07:29] today when your little wife told you
[1:07:32] she'd be your sweetheart wife she was
[1:07:35] looking for somebody to love her and

[1:07:40] looking for somebody when he comes in
[1:07:43] tired and wey from working all day some
[1:07:46] little wife to put her arms around him
[1:07:49] and and kind of brushes hair back and
[1:07:52] tell him how much he loves him that's
[1:07:55] what CA separation in

[1:08:52] know that you are my
[1:08:54] disciples because you have love one for
[1:08:58] the
[1:09:00] other a church is a reflection of its
[1:09:04] Pastor
[1:09:06] right and Brethren that is just the
[1:09:10] truth if he's a hard man the people is
[1:09:15] hard if he's a never forgiving man the
[1:09:18] church will be the same way because
[1:09:21] Brethren We've Got to Believe that he's
[1:09:24] feeding and the people are eating from
[1:09:29] what he's giving right right you know we
[1:09:32] used to have meetings back home and all
[1:09:34] the churches get together and you know
[1:09:37] you could see a bunch of people and you
[1:09:39] didn't know which one of the churches
[1:09:40] they come from cuz naturally sometimes I
[1:09:42] really don't know but you just watch
[1:09:44] them a little bit the way they act yeah
[1:09:47] I said ah I know where they're from I
[1:09:50] know where they're from because they're
[1:09:52] a reflection
[1:09:54] of what they're feeding from you believe
[1:09:58] that and you know they they used to say
[1:10:00] this about us in Lindon they said when
[1:10:03] you go to lindstad you feel
[1:10:06] loved you know Brethren that's the way I
[1:10:09] want it to be amen amen there's a lot of
[1:10:13] fighting there's a lot of things going
[1:10:15] on but when you come to our house you've
[1:10:18] got to feel love right amen you you know
[1:10:22] I'm the kind of person it's not hard for
[1:10:24] me to love anybody it's something that
[1:10:26] was passed on in my jeans you know I
[1:10:29] remember when I was a child we were very
[1:10:31] very poor and you know I remember I mean
[1:10:33] people used to give my mom's little
[1:10:35] little gifts and we didn't have anywhere
[1:10:37] to put it so she gave it to the
[1:10:39] neighbors and I used to walk by The
[1:10:41] Neighbor House and look in their little
[1:10:42] glass case and I see Mama's gift there
[1:10:45] yeah yeah but she gave everything
[1:10:48] away but the church there must be love

[1:10:55] they said well you know I was sick and
[1:10:57] nobody visited me you know I tell you
[1:10:59] what if you're in a love affair when
[1:11:02] you're not there people are going to
[1:11:04] seek you
[1:11:05] out there's sometimes you find in the
[1:11:08] church people has got that kind of
[1:11:10] attitude when they not there you're a
[1:11:13] little bit more relaxed and that's the
[1:11:18] truth blessing the next thing's going to
[1:11:21] happen to you you're going to be sick
[1:11:23] and nobody's going to call you oh Lord
[1:11:25] nobody's going to seek you it's what you
[1:11:28] put in it's what you get
[1:11:31] out amen
[1:11:33] somebody you know you got something

[1:11:52] right
[1:11:54] Hallelujah something's got to be around
[1:11:56] somewhere but I'm certain of one thing
[1:11:59] it's not with God Bren never let there
[1:12:02] be strain in the house of God Amen you
[1:12:06] know we've got a way that if there's
[1:12:08] something that's happened in the church
[1:12:10] you know the way we do is that everybody
[1:12:12] in their little corner conference talk
[1:12:14] about
[1:12:15] it yeah yeah when when the cor
[1:12:20] conference me we all talk about it but
[1:12:22] but to confront the problem we don't do
[1:12:24] that right maybe we don't want it to be
[1:12:27] settled yeah we we we want something to
[1:12:30] talk about you know if you meet together
[1:12:32] if you call somebody there's got to be a
[1:12:34] Hot Topic yeah M you know brother
[1:12:38] sisters so and so oh my I don't know how
[1:12:42] they
[1:12:43] do hello

[1:12:49] family youit I used to hear them say I

[1:14:51] had the word of God to tell him he was
[1:14:53] more than Moses he was God exactly right
[1:14:58] amen I ask a question when will we have
[1:14:59] so much respect for the word of God that
[1:15:02] we believe when when we prayed for our
[1:15:05] Minister earnestly and when he stand
[1:15:07] there to deliver the word of God to us
[1:15:10] it's God
[1:15:12] speaking the word of God coming for to
[1:15:15] you that you can personalize that word
[1:15:18] to your life Breen listen brother BR
[1:15:21] said pray for your pastor because he's
[1:15:23] ordained of God to see you
[1:15:27] true hello somebody that's what he said
[1:15:30] do you believe that Brethren if I
[1:15:33] certainly believe that and I've got a
[1:15:35] God send Pastor I'm going to hold him up
[1:15:38] with my
[1:15:39] pray I'm going to support him with
[1:15:42] everything that I've got I'm going to
[1:15:44] make sure that he's comfortable that he
[1:15:47] is love hello that the grace of God
[1:15:51] surrounds him amen
[1:15:53] I tell you as people of God sometimes
[1:15:55] you've got to even guard your
[1:15:58] minister hello somebody fire DS of the
[1:16:02] enemy doesn't come their way to upset
[1:16:07] them that's right but sometimes you
[1:16:10] think that you're doing good when you
[1:16:12] know brother Dale last week I heard
[1:16:15] brother so and so say this about you and
[1:16:17] I didn't believe that that's the way he
[1:16:19] thinks about you you know brother Dale
[1:16:21] had a good H heart against that brother
[1:16:23] but when you tell him that it hurt his
[1:16:27] feelings and he's just human being like
[1:16:31] everybody
[1:16:32] else and you know you said no what is
[1:16:35] the problem well you know because
[1:16:37] brother so and so say this about him no
[1:16:39] that's not the problem because you told
[1:16:45] him hello it's not because the brother
[1:16:49] felt that way and voice it it's because
[1:16:52] you told him
[1:16:54] right and when he heard it it hurt his
[1:16:57] feelings and when he go to prepare the
[1:17:00] word of God for that day it was all over
[1:17:03] him and he couldn't concentrate and he
[1:17:06] couldn't pray because of what you
[1:17:09] said oh my amen You' got to guard the
[1:17:12] the man of God with your life amen that
[1:17:16] sometimes you take the d That's why God
[1:17:18] plac deacons in the
[1:17:21] church hello I know sometimes we got
[1:17:24] some that sit at the back and
[1:17:26] sleep oh my hello yeah and you know they
[1:17:31] see anything anytime at all they're just
[1:17:33] there but that's why God plac them there
[1:17:37] and me to watch over the body of Christ
[1:17:40] to God the body of Christ me that they
[1:17:43] have Unity among the Brethren right
[1:17:45] people said why is it that when I talk
[1:17:47] to them they don't hear because the
[1:17:50] spirit that you speak to them with right
[1:17:55] you know the Bible speaks about being
[1:17:57] Lord over can we speak like a family the
[1:18:00] Bible speaks about being Lord over God's
[1:18:03] Heritage you know I challenge them them
[1:18:06] people back home I said I challenge you
[1:18:08] all I've never in all the years you know
[1:18:10] me I've never spoken down to anybody
[1:18:14] come on I never do it no sir and if you
[1:18:18] want to respect me that's your business
[1:18:20] but I tell you one thing I'm going to
[1:18:21] show you respect
[1:18:24] hello sometimes we feel like well you
[1:18:26] got to respect me well I don't know if
[1:18:28] you've got to respect me but I know one
[1:18:30] thing that I got to respect the brother
[1:18:33] Christ and that's where you're sitting
[1:18:35] are you there with me we're waiting on
[1:18:38] somebody else to do their part no you do
[1:18:40] your part right right
[1:18:43] exactly and if it's going to be a
[1:18:46] family if it's going to be a
[1:18:49] family you know I I made judgment
[1:18:52] sometimes with with my
[1:18:54] children and you you know I got two
[1:18:56] girls and and the wife so I I tell them
[1:19:00] I said I've got three
[1:19:01] girls and so they they said sometimes oh
[1:19:04] you know I thought you had three
[1:19:05] daughters no I said I got three girls
[1:19:08] two of my daughters and the other is my
[1:19:10] wife but you know sometimes you made a
[1:19:12] judgment and something and you you say
[1:19:14] something about something and they'll
[1:19:16] get around to you and after there's one
[1:19:17] thing about
[1:19:19] [Music]
[1:19:21] girls
[1:19:24] ah see I ain't got no son I don't know
[1:19:26] how it is there something about
[1:19:30] girls and so they they come around and I
[1:19:33] realize I was wrong well I'll tell you
[1:19:36] one thing it's an honorable thing for a
[1:19:39] man if he's wrong to admit that he's
[1:19:42] wrong and say sorry am and I tell you so
[1:19:46] much so a minister in the house of God
[1:19:49] it allows the people to respect you
[1:19:54] amen amen because the Bible says a
[1:19:57] brother that is offended is harder to
[1:20:00] win than a great
[1:20:03] City you know I wonder sometimes why is
[1:20:05] it that some church there's always
[1:20:08] division there's always a fighting
[1:20:10] there's always trouble but you know
[1:20:12] Brethren sometimes it's the way you deal
[1:20:15] with
[1:20:16] situations sometimes we've got some
[1:20:18] spirits that
[1:20:20] escalate oh yeah
[1:20:23] confusion right if there's a confusion
[1:20:26] well I want you to say it again I want
[1:20:28] you to say it again I want to bring you
[1:20:30] before your face and I want you to say I
[1:20:32] want
[1:20:34] yeah you know we can fight over Doctrine
[1:20:37] but I tell you what I've never find a
[1:20:39] man that is converted because we were
[1:20:40] fighting over a doctr right I never find
[1:20:44] anybody we were arguing about it and we
[1:20:47] get real loud and and I want him to
[1:20:49] Christ because I got louder than he I've
[1:20:53] never found it you know what you find is
[1:20:55] vation of
[1:20:58] spirit so in the house of God you've got
[1:21:01] to temper situations with
[1:21:03] love that as a pastor sometimes they
[1:21:05] said you know I see so and so going on
[1:21:08] and BR he didn't say anything about
[1:21:11] it but listen it's not that I didn't see
[1:21:14] it but sometimes you got to watch the
[1:21:17] time and the season to deal with the
[1:21:21] situation because sometimes there's some
[1:21:23] things in the church and and everybody
[1:21:25] wants you to say something about it now
[1:21:28] but there's something you learn when the
[1:21:30] wound is
[1:21:31] fresh if you put salt on it it hurts
[1:21:35] real bad hello somebody but if you allow
[1:21:39] it to go a little bit then in love you
[1:21:42] can curve the
[1:21:44] situation trying to do God a service
[1:21:47] without it being his will brother B said
[1:21:50] don't never start any start or or try an
[1:21:54] organization don't try to build upon
[1:21:56] anything else stay but stay humble
[1:22:00] before the Lord your God Amen humble
[1:22:03] right walk in humility before God Micah
[1:22:08] 6 and verse 8 I show thee oh man what is
[1:22:11] good and what the lord requires of thee
[1:22:14] but to do justly to love mercy and to
[1:22:17] walk humble with your God
[1:22:21] right
[1:22:23] he said for it looks like the gates may
[1:22:27] open unto the promised land soon he said
[1:22:30] then let us go in with the true singing
[1:22:33] and rejoicing when the bride and groom
[1:22:35] takes its place at the throne brother
[1:22:40] brandham giving a word to the church he
[1:22:44] said live humble right are you there
[1:22:47] with me Amen in other words as Believers
[1:22:51] don't live above your
[1:22:54] means and you say to the people don't
[1:22:57] try to live to live like somebody else
[1:23:01] said live humble live loving love one
[1:23:05] another don't never get nothing among
[1:23:08] you if you see something coming up in
[1:23:11] your heart against somebody get it out
[1:23:14] of there right then he said then Satan
[1:23:17] will do his best to get among you see
[1:23:21] right don't you let that happen listen
[1:23:24] Brethren he will get among
[1:23:30] you I tell you he will get in the midst
[1:23:34] of the Brotherhood right hello somebody
[1:23:38] you know I've got to be sensitive even
[1:23:40] to the
[1:23:42] ministers as I feel led to ask somebody
[1:23:45] to preach and a certain a certain
[1:23:48] service I I've got to be real
[1:23:51] sensitive because
[1:23:54] Spirits can be created oh yeah among the
[1:23:58] Brotherhood so you've got to be careful
[1:24:01] what you're
[1:24:02] doing I tell you
[1:24:05] amen yes
[1:24:07] sir he
[1:24:09] said and Satan will do his best to get
[1:24:12] among you don't you let that happen he
[1:24:15] said some slick tongue fellow might come
[1:24:19] along and try to take your away from it
[1:24:23] he said you think they could talk Moses
[1:24:26] out of the presence of God where it
[1:24:29] stood there and seen it no sir no we
[1:24:33] don't take it take from it or add to it
[1:24:37] just keep it that way Lord the Lord said
[1:24:40] we don't want no
[1:24:42] denomination we don't want no
[1:24:44] organization we don't want no malice we
[1:24:47] don't want no Strife we want God amen
[1:24:51] amen
[1:24:53] and you know Brethren when you start to
[1:24:55] get clish with each other that's when
[1:24:57] the spirit of organization seem like
[1:24:59] it's coming creeping into the church you
[1:25:03] know when we've got our favorite little
[1:25:05] click in the church that we keep
[1:25:08] together and the rest of them we we
[1:25:10] might not care you know what happened
[1:25:13] because we've got our little group oh
[1:25:15] yeah we've got to watch that Spirit
[1:25:17] that's right that's right are you there
[1:25:19] with me because Brethren the least among
[1:25:22] you is a part of the body of Christ amen
[1:25:25] are you there with me and have the same
[1:25:28] need we must try the same feeling one
[1:25:32] for another amen you know I love you
[1:25:35] brother I love you sister because you're
[1:25:37] a part of the body of Jesus Christ
[1:25:41] right
[1:25:43] amen we want God and is a
[1:25:47] word hallelujah Glory we want God and he
[1:25:52] is the word let the word of God dwell
[1:25:56] with you rich all we say tonight for we
[1:26:00] have come this far right by faith right
[1:26:05] amen by
[1:26:08] faith let me see the answer of those who
[1:26:11] can say I I've been here from the start
[1:26:13] yeah from 1971 I I was around at that
[1:26:17] time oh it's it's a new gen it's a new
[1:26:20] generation exctly but you know there was
[1:26:23] something about when the children of
[1:26:24] Israel reached Jordan it was a
[1:26:27] generation that was born in the
[1:26:29] wilderness right those were the ones
[1:26:32] that cross over into the
[1:26:35] promise many of the old fathers the
[1:26:38] fighters that were there from yester
[1:26:40] year the experience that they had never
[1:26:44] brought them to that position but by the
[1:26:46] grace of God tonight here we are and
[1:26:50] here we stand by faith believing in God
[1:26:54] I asked the question how we stronger
[1:26:57] today right how are we were
[1:27:00] yesterday oh Brethren there were many
[1:27:02] things you had to fight to as a
[1:27:04] church there many were here that they're
[1:27:07] no longer here yeah there many who have
[1:27:10] gone called in their experience and to
[1:27:13] them there was no more need to be a part
[1:27:15] of the body of Christ but we have come
[1:27:18] this far by faith and Brethren it's not
[1:27:22] because you are stronger we say that
[1:27:24] anything that we have achieved it's by
[1:27:26] the grace of God it's by the grace of
[1:27:30] God that has kept me because I'm no
[1:27:33] better than them who have gone on I'm no
[1:27:36] better than them that I'm no longer here
[1:27:38] but by the grace of God let us say this
[1:27:42] evening that God must see something God
[1:27:45] must have invested something in me to
[1:27:48] keep me all these
[1:27:50] things Hallelujah that's
[1:27:53] right and you
[1:27:55] know I say
[1:27:58] this they don't understand me but I I I
[1:28:01] have this kind of
[1:28:03] belief if you're in a church and you're
[1:28:06] not comfortable with that
[1:28:08] church might be your are to
[1:28:14] go you know every time back home where
[1:28:17] you know brother might says well you
[1:28:19] they feel like they need to be at that
[1:28:22] church before they go I called the
[1:28:24] minister I said well you know brother so
[1:28:26] and so say he feels like you're his
[1:28:30] pastor and uh there there's nothing
[1:28:32] between me and him but you know if he
[1:28:35] feels that way I believe might be you're
[1:28:36] better able to lead him and there's
[1:28:38] nothing wrong with that there's nothing
[1:28:41] wrong with that right and you know I
[1:28:43] send them in the name of the Lord but
[1:28:45] you know the problem I have is that
[1:28:47] after a few years when they come back
[1:28:50] yes and they be bitter with the brother
[1:28:51] the brother don't speak to
[1:28:53] me I said brother I I ain't doing do
[1:28:56] nothing I mean I send the brother off in
[1:28:58] peace if he comes back not speaking to
[1:29:01] you that's not my fault right
[1:29:05] exactly you know brethren we we've got
[1:29:08] to realize that there's going to be
[1:29:09] people who no longer worship where you
[1:29:11] worship but they your
[1:29:16] brothers and I find this many of times
[1:29:19] it's not so much the ministers
[1:29:22] that have anything against each other
[1:29:25] right but it's the people who want to
[1:29:28] move from Pastor to Pastor yeah you know
[1:29:31] they they're in this church and and
[1:29:33] they're there for a while and and they
[1:29:35] quit praying they quit having a
[1:29:37] relationship with God and you know what
[1:29:39] they do they blame the church they said
[1:29:42] well I'm not being fed yeah well I being
[1:29:45] I been fed I'm going to go and so you
[1:29:48] know go they go with that bad taste and
[1:29:50] they go and they tell brother so so you
[1:29:52] know brother so so I was there and I
[1:29:54] ain't being fed and so you know I heard
[1:29:56] you and I believe you're really feeding
[1:29:58] the people and and I'm I'm willing to
[1:30:00] stay with you in the next two years they
[1:30:02] gone again were they lying when they
[1:30:04] come or when they go what was a problem
[1:30:08] exactly and so the Ministries God to
[1:30:10] have more wisdom than that that people
[1:30:12] are going to run to and fr don't let
[1:30:14] that affect you hello somebody and I
[1:30:18] tell them and and if you go and if you
[1:30:20] come again I'm still here by God's grace
[1:30:23] to receive you amen because you can't
[1:30:26] send them off and you can't there's
[1:30:28] nothing you can do but preach the word
[1:30:30] of God to
[1:30:31] them but Brethren if you stay with the
[1:30:35] word of God you can't do any
[1:30:39] different people say well are they
[1:30:42] preaching the message and every time
[1:30:45] they ask that they're they're really
[1:30:46] saying are they preaching what I'm
[1:30:48] preaching yeah
[1:30:50] rightly
[1:30:55] are are they preaching the message you
[1:30:57] see they want you to preach exactly what
[1:30:59] they're preaching right but brother if
[1:31:01] if you didn't tell me then how should I
[1:31:04] preach it yeah because I can only preach
[1:31:07] what God give me are you with me and so
[1:31:11] listen you can't be like anybody else
[1:31:14] and you can't be like another church and
[1:31:17] you know you look over Yonder you said
[1:31:19] oh but that church they they ain't got
[1:31:21] no
[1:31:22] problem I heard brother perig green said
[1:31:24] one time on T said the only church that
[1:31:26] ain't got no problem is the one that you
[1:31:28] don't know them well enough to know the
[1:31:29] problems that they've
[1:31:31] got
[1:31:33] exactly right but I'm sensible enough to
[1:31:36] know that people are the same wherever
[1:31:39] you go exactly I tell you you've got a
[1:31:41] little lighter complexion but I know you
[1:31:44] give the same problems like them back in
[1:31:46] Jamaica exactly I know you drive better
[1:31:49] cars but you've got the same problem you
[1:31:51] you don't walk to church but you got the
[1:31:53] same problems and you give the same
[1:31:55] problems are you there with me and I
[1:31:58] know if if sadale failed to Pastor you I
[1:32:01] would fail too somebody said oh brother
[1:32:04] kid we're going to pack up and come to
[1:32:05] Jamaica I said no don't
[1:32:09] come because you wouldn't be able to
[1:32:12] deal with it I challenge you you
[1:32:14] couldn't deal with it but it just seems
[1:32:17] better on the other side oh yeah and so
[1:32:20] wherever God place you
[1:32:22] is the place that you ought to
[1:32:24] be hello somebody and you ought to be
[1:32:27] sensible enough to know that where God
[1:32:30] places where God wants you sometimes it
[1:32:33] look better on the other side but you
[1:32:35] just go there for a
[1:32:37] while hello and sometimes when you see
[1:32:40] you would to God you go back but people
[1:32:42] are so ashamed they won't come back and
[1:32:45] say well you know I was wrong and I
[1:32:47] shouldn't leave in the first place amen
[1:32:50] but we've come this far back
[1:32:53] it's by faith believing in God and let
[1:32:56] me tell you if God has molded you
[1:32:59] together as a family stay that
[1:33:02] way stay that way amen you know
[1:33:05] sometimes we said oh but but that church
[1:33:07] it's got a
[1:33:09] Revival you you know I talk to people
[1:33:11] sometimes and they're part of large
[1:33:13] churches and you know we we meet places
[1:33:16] and he said oh which church you go to
[1:33:18] and I go to which church you go to and
[1:33:19] they've never met each other yeah and
[1:33:22] they go to the same
[1:33:25] church
[1:33:27] hello and you know you can't speak to
[1:33:30] your pastor because he's got such a
[1:33:32] flock that you've got to send an
[1:33:34] appointment to see
[1:33:37] him it used to be that when I get to
[1:33:39] study in the office back home you know
[1:33:42] people stringing from the door and they
[1:33:44] want to see me so the deacons used to
[1:33:46] stay at the door and to keep them out so
[1:33:47] that they don't come to me I said listen
[1:33:49] this one thing I said any body want to
[1:33:52] speak to me I want to speak to them amen
[1:33:55] I don't want nobody to stop nobody from
[1:33:57] speak to me because listen I'm a servant
[1:34:01] to the people and anytime we believe
[1:34:05] we're more than servant to the people we
[1:34:07] are walking out of the will of God
[1:34:11] [Applause]
[1:34:14] Amen you might got a need it might be
[1:34:17] the dead of night but if that's a time
[1:34:19] that you've got the need I mean if I'm
[1:34:21] going to be a Shepherd I want to know
[1:34:23] what the need is amen are you there with
[1:34:25] me right and Brethren the final thing I
[1:34:27] I say to a
[1:34:28] church Paul said to Timothy Timothy keep
[1:34:32] those things that is committed to thy
[1:34:35] trust
[1:34:38] Brethren the thing that I've seen affect
[1:34:40] churches all the
[1:34:43] time is when within the ministry there
[1:34:46] is no trust to the people
[1:34:49] yeah and if a family sit and say
[1:34:53] something about the the Deep areas of
[1:34:56] their
[1:34:57] lives that the only person that really
[1:35:00] want to tell is
[1:35:02] God I only sit and listen as a servant
[1:35:05] of God Amen and I tell people I've got
[1:35:09] no
[1:35:10] authority to say what their problems
[1:35:13] were than to tell it to God Amen cuz
[1:35:16] Brethren one of the worst thing that you
[1:35:18] can find in the house of God is if the
[1:35:21] dark things or the Deep things that you
[1:35:24] speak about you hear it all over the
[1:35:28] church brethren we are to keep the
[1:35:31] confidence of one another as Brethren
[1:35:35] right because it shows that you've got
[1:35:38] the spirit of God and the love of God is
[1:35:41] with you right and I use this Mark as I
[1:35:44] close to explain this to you you see
[1:35:48] when a family and within the nucleus of
[1:35:50] a family
[1:35:52] there is a
[1:35:53] problem and that problem affects the pro
[1:35:56] the family in such a way that it affects
[1:35:59] their esteem they will never talk about
[1:36:03] it they will never talk about it and
[1:36:06] Brethren that's how it ought to be with
[1:36:08] the house of God you know it doesn't
[1:36:12] matter what happens at Lula yeah the
[1:36:15] church next door right should never know
[1:36:18] about it yeah right hello amen because
[1:36:21] God call us as a unit and a family
[1:36:25] together and that is why together as a
[1:36:28] church we try to deal with the things
[1:36:32] that are here in Lula together and we
[1:36:35] pray for one another and we cry to God
[1:36:38] for one another and we cry before God to
[1:36:41] one another until that thing leave the
[1:36:44] people right but Brethren we've got no
[1:36:47] need we've got no authority to take it
[1:36:50] out of Lula because God is committing us
[1:36:54] to the trust that we have
[1:36:56] one and that shows the love that we've
[1:37:00] got one for another
[1:37:02] amen and you
[1:37:05] know I have this confidence when people
[1:37:08] steps into the office to speak to me I
[1:37:11] say to them I said and what I want you
[1:37:14] to do is to tell me the truth the truth
[1:37:18] because I can only judge before God
[1:37:21] right if you tell me the truth and all
[1:37:23] of the truth and if you lie to me you
[1:37:26] lie before God and you'll never be
[1:37:29] delivered right but I tell him one thing
[1:37:31] I said no listen but when you speak to
[1:37:34] me I want you to say nothing to nobody
[1:37:38] yeah right because one thing I'll do
[1:37:40] I'll never mention it right and you want
[1:37:43] not to mention it we're going to take
[1:37:45] this thing to God and we're going to put
[1:37:48] it under the blood exactly and Brethren
[1:37:50] as Believers we have confidence one with
[1:37:54] the other because we keep the trust of
[1:37:58] the people of God and you know I find
[1:38:00] out of that experience when something
[1:38:02] happen and somebody comes to me to talk
[1:38:06] about something that has sticken place
[1:38:08] they have no problem in speaking the
[1:38:09] truth because one thing they know by
[1:38:12] experience right they will never hear it
[1:38:15] otherwise
[1:38:17] amen because we are a people together
[1:38:20] the family
[1:38:21] of
[1:38:22] Goden let me tell you there's more
[1:38:25] forces on the outside that's right that
[1:38:27] would want to break the church apart oh
[1:38:30] yes that there's forces that would keep
[1:38:33] the church together so what do we do we
[1:38:37] stuck together as a unit amen amen as an
[1:38:42] organism amen that is stuck together
[1:38:45] that cannot be removed one for the other
[1:38:48] that we pray for each other's children
[1:38:50] that we protect take each other's
[1:38:52] children that we pray for the families
[1:38:54] that we counsel with the mothers and the
[1:38:56] fathers and we speak the things that are
[1:38:59] needful for the body of Christ that the
[1:39:02] Church of God be solid with the word of
[1:39:04] God
[1:39:06] right this is not
[1:39:08] preaching this is speaking to the house
[1:39:10] of

[1:47:06] let's move on let's step over the
[1:47:09] lane walk on into a
[1:47:13] chain come and grow with me I
[1:47:19] am
[1:47:23] see I believe that for the bride I
[1:47:24] believe it for all of
[1:47:26] us it's time to move
[1:47:28] on
[1:47:32] Jesus he the only one who cares and
[1:47:42] understand standing
[1:47:44] somewhere in the
[1:47:47] shadows you will find
[1:47:58] the believe
[1:48:00] it standing somewhere in the shadow to
[1:48:07] my
[1:48:10] Jesus he's the only one who cares and
[1:48:19] understand anding somewhere in the
[1:48:23] shadows you will find it how will you
[1:48:28] know you know him by
[1:48:35] the you believe
[1:48:38] it do we appreciate God and what he's
[1:48:41] done for
[1:48:42] us as the brother said it's always going
[1:48:46] straight
[1:48:47] forward there is no part of an armor in
[1:48:51] a Christian armor right for the back
[1:48:53] part of you right it's always a
[1:48:56] breastplates always in front there is
[1:48:58] nothing for the back right because
[1:49:01] there's no going
[1:49:02] back when they went across Jordan into
[1:49:05] Canaan they could go right or
[1:49:08] left you know cuz that was in the land
[1:49:11] the main point was to go straight on but
[1:49:14] they could never turn and come back
[1:49:17] out so you can't do that
[1:49:20] is
[1:49:22] straightforward if none goes with me
[1:49:24] then I'll go myself cuz that's what we
[1:49:25] got to believe every one of us has got
[1:49:27] to have that personal point in our mind
[1:49:30] to believe and say it's straight
[1:49:32] straight
[1:49:33] forward don't tur it back just going on
[1:49:36] down the road and that way if anybody
[1:49:38] wants to go with you then you always
[1:49:40] give a hi at hand say come on let's go
[1:49:43] together and you know what you find out
[1:49:46] then there a lot of people want to go
[1:49:47] with you you know Elijah thought one
[1:49:49] time he thought now Lord I'm the only
[1:49:53] one the Lord said
[1:49:55] no I've got a few thousand
[1:49:58] back that's doing the same thing you do
[1:50:01] and they just kind of undercover and
[1:50:02] they need somebody to stir them up a
[1:50:04] little and now you've done that and
[1:50:06] everything will work on so let's just
[1:50:08] move on go on forward in the promised

[1:54:02] me
[1:54:16] Meen just make sure you tell brother re
[1:54:19] let youe
[1:54:20] message we believe
[1:54:22] it we believe that God has been with us
[1:54:24] for 40 years to bring us to a place to
[1:54:27] stand and and be a beacon of light for
[1:54:30] you know the people that can can listen
[1:54:33] and and try to hear and we you know for
[1:54:36] a long time I would never I wanted to go
[1:54:39] out on the field and try to help some
[1:54:41] and but I found out I couldn't do it it
[1:54:43] just didn't work CU people just didn't
[1:54:45] want me and things like that to to go
[1:54:48] and preach for them but
[1:54:50] then God gave us an opportunity to open
[1:54:52] up the internet where that anybody
[1:54:53] wanted to listen could listen right and
[1:54:57] you know a lot of preachers don't like
[1:54:58] that because they they're upset because
[1:55:01] somebody hears more than than what
[1:55:03] they're saying and things and they get
[1:55:04] all upset and all but you know I've
[1:55:07] never claimed to have all the
[1:55:10] answers but I claim to know a God that
[1:55:14] knows
[1:55:15] all and that way then I you know my way
[1:55:18] of saying it smart SM man is not
[1:55:20] somebody that knows everything cuz his
[1:55:22] mind is too full a smart man is a person
[1:55:25] that knows where to go to somebody that
[1:55:28] knows the answer that's a smart one cuz
[1:55:31] then that way you can go and you can
[1:55:33] just get the answer and come back and
[1:55:34] everything's fine so that's all I've
[1:55:36] ever tried to be to anybody I will not
[1:55:38] go on the internet and be an internet
[1:55:41] preacher we do not encourage that we
[1:55:43] encourage you go to your churches and
[1:55:45] you pray and you do you know and even
[1:55:47] pastors will write questions and I won't
[1:55:50] even answer the pastor's questions
[1:55:52] because I'm not going to get on the
[1:55:53] internet system you know to do that
[1:55:56] because I have no nothing to do I'm just
[1:55:59] a preacher of the Gospel if somebody
[1:56:01] wants to hear then we just rejoice and
[1:56:04] and go on and I encourage you out there
[1:56:05] to go to your home churches and back
[1:56:08] your pastor you know CU if you hear
[1:56:11] anything just just thank God from what
[1:56:14] you hear and move on Amen and if you'll
[1:56:17] go as the prophet said one day he said
[1:56:19] go back to them churches and he said if
[1:56:21] you'll let your light shine he said your
[1:56:23] pastor will be very proud of
[1:56:25] you now some of them might not be but I
[1:56:28] can't help that but you know really true
[1:56:30] pastors will they'll be proud and
