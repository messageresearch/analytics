[0:09] so make sure this is
[0:13] working good
[0:15] morning
[0:19] good okay we go so let me just
[0:23] background for everybody that would have
[0:25] been missing and we got this nice little
[0:27] picture up here that I swap internet to
[0:31] kind of illustrate what we've been
[0:32] talking about the last couple of Sunday
[0:35] school lessons is communion and
[0:37] communion is is uh I'm I'm taking a
[0:39] different track than than the Lord's
[0:41] Supper because the Lord's Supper is is
[0:44] what we take in remembrance of our
[0:45] communion with the Lord is is you take
[0:48] it if you're in communion with the Lord
[0:50] but real communion is fellowship with
[0:52] him and and communion is what brother
[0:54] Wade has been talking about for the last
[0:56] year and a half is the statue of a
[0:58] perfect man and which ties together so
[1:00] many other other doctrines and that that
[1:03] brother brand brought to us that real
[1:06] commun sister
[1:09] Johnny God bless
[1:13] you Brother
[1:15] Lou asking you shall
[1:20] receive yeah it's good to good to see
[1:22] we're getting a full house back here
[1:26] wonderful but real communion is is
[1:28] bringing us back into fellowship with
[1:30] God because we uh in the Garden of Eden
[1:33] uh Adam and Eve took one word off and
[1:35] and that got them out of fellowship with
[1:37] the Lord so that they could not walk
[1:39] together and and you know uh communion
[1:42] is is uh is there's so many different
[1:46] things that go into communion communion
[1:47] is to know God's will communion is to be
[1:50] able to walk with the Lord think about
[1:52] all the scriptures and the little
[1:53] stories through the Old Testament and
[1:55] and even in brother R's life about
[1:57] walking with the Lord how how uh that
[2:00] story I told last time about how brother
[2:01] brand started his journey by writing a
[2:03] little message to the Lord in the woods
[2:05] I know you come I know you come by here
[2:07] I want to talk to you and then fast
[2:11] forward a few a few decades maybe and
[2:14] and one day brother Ram's up in the on
[2:16] the top of a mountain and comes the
[2:17] storm and the Lord comes down and says
[2:19] walk with me and he said it'll be the
[2:21] greatest privilege I have to walk with
[2:23] you and go back into the in the Genesis
[2:26] one after Abraham had completed his his
[2:28] little journey and and God says walk
[2:31] before me and be thou perfect
[2:34] and and uh and and Peter come walk with
[2:38] me on the water and and and and one
[2:40] that's really crucial is one that walked
[2:43] with God and was not found he walked
[2:45] with God and after he had made a
[2:48] monument to what brother Wade had been
[2:49] speaking on on the Statue of perfect man
[2:52] a monument to his Revelation that God
[2:54] had given him real communion and after
[2:56] he had that communion with God that he
[2:58] was able to walk with him then in he
[3:00] took a body change now uh and kind of
[3:04] the the the key point of what I've been
[3:06] talking about is in this this uh this
[3:08] quote that I've been reading from what
[3:10] was the Holy Ghost given for in
[3:13] 1959 where brother Brown says God poured
[3:16] himself into Christ correct Christ
[3:17] poured himself into the church therefore
[3:19] now watch at that day you will know that
[3:21] I am in the father and you are in me and
[3:23] I am in you at that day you'll know it
[3:25] for it's the whole thing is one Plan of
[3:27] Redemption coming down that God coming
[3:29] back to live in and dwell in and dwell
[3:32] with and commune to his people as he did
[3:34] at the beginning now now here's the
[3:37] here's the culmination then as soon as
[3:39] he gets his church in speaking
[3:41] conditions and you to get it to when
[3:44] you're in speaking conditions you know
[3:45] what God's will is you know what he
[3:46] wants you know who you are and you know
[3:48] who he is you know you're in communion
[3:51] because you're speaking the same
[3:52] language you're talking the same talk
[3:54] you're walking the same walk you're
[3:56] living the life that he lived you're in
[3:58] communion now then as soon as he gets
[4:01] his church and speaking conditions gets
[4:03] his
[4:05] church to a place that he can flow
[4:08] himself through and love and persuade
[4:10] and fellowship then there come an Eden
[4:13] now remember what brother Way's been
[4:15] bringing out that the stature of perfect
[4:16] man is Go is is is God moving in the
[4:19] church in you to get him to get you in a
[4:22] place where he can have total control
[4:24] total control over your body spirit and
[4:27] soul he'll take his church back to where
[4:31] it left him back in an Eden there where
[4:33] it fell in now now that's where it made
[4:36] its first start of fall that's where
[4:38] it'll take it right back with every with
[4:41] every Clean Slate of redemption so to so
[4:44] the communion to to have communion with
[4:46] God is to walk with God to have
[4:48] communion you you can't have a a real a
[4:52] real Christian relationship with God
[4:54] without communion because that's what
[4:55] the whole point of it is to have a
[4:57] relationship with God you say I'm going
[4:59] to I'm I'm going to go to church but I'm
[5:02] not going to pray I'm not going to have
[5:03] any private time with God I'm not going
[5:05] to I'm not going to spend time reading
[5:07] the Bible alone I'm not going to you're
[5:09] you're forsaken the relationship with
[5:11] God and that's what the whole the gospel
[5:13] is about that's what the ministers are
[5:15] doing is trying to bring the people into
[5:18] a communion with God and not a communion
[5:22] I don't if my goal is to bring you into
[5:25] communion with me then that's that's
[5:27] wrong you see that's what I'm going to
[5:29] be talking about in in a few
[5:32] minutes to know his will in Matthew 7
[5:35] I'm just going to run through some
[5:36] scriptures real quick Matthew
[5:38] 7:21 Jesus said not everyone that saith
[5:41] unto me Lord Lord shall enter into the
[5:42] kingdom of heaven but he that doeth the
[5:44] will of My Father which is in
[5:47] heaven in Acts 221
[5:52] 13-4 it say brother Saul uh I think this
[5:56] is an brother Saul receive thy sight and
[5:58] the same hour looked upon it and he said
[6:00] the god of our fathers is Paul telling
[6:02] about his conversion the god of our
[6:04] fathers has chosen thee why did he chose
[6:07] Paul choose Paul that thou should us
[6:10] know his will and see that just one and
[6:13] should hear the voice of his
[6:15] mouth in John 4: 23- 24 but the hour
[6:19] cometh and now is when the true
[6:21] worshippers now this this is such a key
[6:24] scripture when Jesus is talking to the
[6:26] woman at the well and there's so many
[6:29] good things you can get out of the the
[6:30] story of the woman of the well how how
[6:32] she was in so steeped in sin but he came
[6:35] he found value in her life he he you
[6:37] know he was her pearl of great price his
[6:40] Pearl his pearl of great price he he saw
[6:42] Val in her and came to tell her about
[6:44] the gospel and and then he's telling her
[6:46] something about when the when the when
[6:47] the when the spirit and the truth are
[6:50] joined together on the day of Pentecost
[6:52] when the Believers have heard the truth
[6:54] and the spirit comes and quickens that
[6:56] then you're going to be able to enter
[6:57] into real communion with the Lord with
[7:00] me you're going to be real real
[7:02] fellowship and that's what he says the
[7:04] hour cometh and now is when the true
[7:06] worship worshippers shall worship the
[7:09] father in spirit and in truth for the
[7:11] father seeketh such to worship him God
[7:13] is a spirit and they that worship Him
[7:16] must worship Him in spirit and in
[7:19] truth now that's kind
[7:22] of that's that's lay in the background
[7:26] so let's turn over to Matthew chapter
[7:29] chapter
[7:33] 13 cuz I I know I I cut off in the
[7:36] middle of a thought last Sunday school
[7:38] lesson and I I haven't forgotten about
[7:41] that hey you know I'm I'm going to try
[7:43] to stop saying I'm I'm going in this
[7:46] direction because every time I say that
[7:47] well I end up going in another Direction
[7:50] and
[7:51] uh and you know that's kind of what I I
[7:54] want to talk about is because we' got to
[7:57] real communion with the Lord is where
[7:58] that when the spirit begins to lead you
[8:00] and that's how the church the True
[8:01] Church of God is supposed to be a
[8:03] spirit-led church not just where um not
[8:07] just where brother Dale was only one Le
[8:08] the spirit but where every member
[8:11] individually that on the day of
[8:13] Pentecost that that great Pillar of Fire
[8:15] broke itself out and became little licks
[8:17] of fire on every individual member so it
[8:20] wasn't just the it's it's not big eyes
[8:22] and it's not where only the ministers
[8:24] have fellowship with God that's right
[8:25] and communion but it's where every
[8:27] individual has communion with God every
[8:29] individual with Spirit
[8:31] Le and has a personal revelation of the
[8:34] scripture
[8:36] amen so let's
[8:39] see Matthew Chapter
[8:43] 13 and we're going to start at verse 10
[8:46] but but look at the first of this the
[8:48] first of this uh chapter is where he
[8:50] begins to talk about the parable of the
[8:52] S went forth the so
[8:55] um this the seed of the word is swn in
[8:58] the different kinds of Hearts it's on
[8:59] into some that will hold it and let it
[9:01] grow and some that are Stony and and and
[9:03] and we know that Parable all the all the
[9:05] different teachings of that but then we
[9:07] come down to verse 10 and it's important
[9:09] to kind of keep the context of these
[9:11] little Parables because when you when
[9:12] you kind of are grasping it what does
[9:15] this really mean well read around a
[9:16] little bit and you can get the get the
[9:19] get the the meaning of what it what it's
[9:21] trying to say and the disciples came and
[9:24] and said unto him now this is kind of
[9:25] what I've been getting at is real
[9:27] communion with God see Jesus go and
[9:29] teach a parable to the to the people at
[9:31] large and then the disciples maybe not
[9:34] fully understand their own self would
[9:36] take Jesus in private and say tell us
[9:41] open this up to me so that I can
[9:43] understand it well that's the same way
[9:44] you got to do you come to church and you
[9:47] hear the preaching over the pulpit that
[9:49] maybe you don't understand I I don't I
[9:51] don't know what he's talking about just
[9:53] the same way that they did when Jesus
[9:56] was preaching I don't know what he's
[9:57] talking about and they went in private
[10:01] and got along with Jesus and Jesus
[10:05] opened it up to them and plainly showed
[10:07] them and that's the same way he'll do
[10:09] when you get uh when you get in
[10:11] communion with God you take it back to
[10:13] your your your prayer closet or your
[10:15] little uh room where you you search the
[10:18] scriptures like the uh the ones in Acts
[10:21] uh whose Name Escapes me uh that that
[10:24] search the Scriptures Daily to prove
[10:25] what was in them whether they were right
[10:28] or not take take it back to your private
[10:30] place and and God will open it up to
[10:33] you cuz the communion is is fellowship
[10:37] with God it's it's a relationship with
[10:39] God it's not somebody um uh we're not
[10:42] just in school or something we're we're
[10:45] the the point of this is to be in
[10:47] communion with
[10:49] God he answered and said unto them in
[10:52] verse 10 and the disciples came and said
[10:53] unto him why speakest thou unto them in
[10:55] Parables he answered and said unto them
[10:57] because it is given unto you
[10:59] to know the mysteries of the kingdom of
[11:01] heaven but to them it is not given why
[11:04] was it not given he just taught the
[11:06] parable of the seed sew in the sea
[11:10] there's different kinds of Hearts some
[11:11] people will receive it some will say and
[11:14] I I was listening to a sermon where
[11:15] brother rown was saying why can is it
[11:18] that that that a Ministry can preach for
[11:21] years and years on dress and clothes and
[11:23] different kinds of things and all the
[11:25] things of the scriptures and some people
[11:28] will just sit out out there and and it
[11:30] it's just like it it's falling on Stony
[11:32] ground it doesn't there's no effect made
[11:35] there's no change made and there's
[11:37] different kinds of hearts that it falls
[11:39] into it's it's your desire it's based on
[11:41] your desire do you want it enough do you
[11:44] do you want to have communion do you
[11:47] want it bad enough to do like brother
[11:48] brandom did and go into the woods God
[11:50] whatever it takes I'm going to write a
[11:52] letter I only know how to approach it
[11:54] right but something's something's got to
[11:57] give and that's that's really the basis
[11:59] of communion is is whatever it takes
[12:02] whatever it takes to stay with God's
[12:05] word that's that's where Adam and Eve
[12:07] messed up is they uh they they failed to
[12:09] do to just to lay aside everything else
[12:12] of the world all all the ideas contrary
[12:15] to that they failed to laid aside and
[12:17] stay absolutely with God's
[12:19] word because it is given unto you to
[12:22] know the mysteries of the kingdom of
[12:23] heaven but to them it is not given for
[12:25] whosoever hath to him shall be given and
[12:28] he shall have more abundance but
[12:30] whosoever hath not from him shall be
[12:33] taken away even that he hath therefore
[12:36] speak out to them in Parables because
[12:38] they seeing see not and hearing they
[12:41] hear not neither do they understand now
[12:44] that's a Str strange thing whosoever ha
[12:47] not for him shall be taken away but if
[12:49] you got you'll get more now now what has
[12:54] brother way been talking about first be
[12:57] born again and once you're born again
[13:00] you'll get more right but if you're not
[13:04] born again if all you have is knowledge
[13:07] then that's going to be taken away from
[13:10] you now let's go over to Matthew
[13:21] 21 I was just reading of that thinking
[13:25] of thinking of Nicodemus coming and and
[13:29] and going so far you know Jesus taught
[13:31] all the The Parables of the talents you
[13:33] know that the different the men will be
[13:35] given different amounts of talents and
[13:36] one took his talent and hid it away I'm
[13:39] I'm not going to do nothing with it now
[13:41] now you know you think about we're in a
[13:43] place
[13:44] where the the message has been laid out
[13:47] so plain for us all the means of Grace
[13:50] into the entrance of the Kingdom of
[13:52] Heaven have been laid out so plain and
[13:55] for us to not take it to take it and
[13:56] just like pull on shelf somewhere and
[13:58] say I'm not I'm not I'm just going to
[14:01] keep it over there and and not really do
[14:03] anything with it God don't want God
[14:05] wants you to put it into action God
[14:07] wants you to to not like Nicodemus or
[14:12] um some of the others in in the Bible
[14:15] that failed to go on right but it's a
[14:17] continual moving you know brother Way's
[14:19] been bringing out I keep quoting brother
[14:23] way because he's been bringing out some
[14:25] good stuff that uh you can't if if if
[14:29] you just if you just stop and don't go
[14:31] on from justification then there's
[14:33] something wrong is if you're just a
[14:34] justification for two or three years
[14:37] then then there's a problem or or 10
[14:39] years let's say to make it even more
[14:42] dramatic that you got to keep you got to
[14:44] keep moving on don't just hoard up your
[14:47] your uh your knowledge your teaching you
[14:50] and we've got have have been given so
[14:52] much especially at this church you know
[14:57] where it's been it's been laid out we
[14:58] have no excuse to say well well I just I
[15:01] just don't understand it so I'm just
[15:03] going to put it up on the shelf and we
[15:05] should do everything we can that's right
[15:07] to stay with God's word and and and and
[15:10] get in communion with him and
[15:15] um uh through stammering lips and other
[15:17] tongue y'all forgive me I'm stammering a
[15:19] little bit
[15:20] but so Matthew 21 let's that's where
[15:23] we're going Matthew 21:
[15:26] 42 and 43
[15:40] ah yeah let's say let's start
[15:45] um let's start at verse 41 they say unto
[15:48] him he he will miserably destroy those
[15:50] wicked men let's end in that last
[15:52] Parable then verse 42 Jesus saith unto
[15:54] them did you never read in the
[15:56] scriptures the stone which the builders
[15:58] rejected the same has become the head of
[15:59] the corner this is the Lord's doing and
[16:02] it is marvelous in our eyes therefore
[16:04] say I unto you the kingdom of God shall
[16:06] be taken from you and given to a nation
[16:09] bringing forth the fruits thereof and
[16:12] whosoever shall fall on this Stone shall
[16:14] be broken but on whomsoever it shall
[16:17] fall it will grind him to
[16:21] power now I got 15 minutes to get into
[16:26] something so uh what I
[16:29] what I was thinking on it now you know
[16:31] we know where the Cornerstone is and The
[16:33] Headstone or brother way is going to be
[16:34] teaching on that in a little bit really
[16:36] what what The Headstone is but we know
[16:37] that the Cornerstone of faith that
[16:40] you're born again at Faith and adopted
[16:43] you know brother W has explained all
[16:45] that but now now think about this
[16:49] now that stone that came out of the
[16:52] mountain
[16:53] destroyed everything that was set up
[16:56] well let's go let's go back I I'm going
[16:59] to go back to Genesis chapter
[17:02] 9 where this image that's destroyed
[17:05] first starts being set up really this
[17:07] babylonish
[17:10] image it kind of change the
[17:16] way change change the the tone a little
[17:19] bit
[17:30] and in Genesis chapter
[17:33] 9 verse
[17:35] one and God blessed Noah and his sons
[17:38] and said unto them be fruitful and
[17:39] multiply and replenish the
[17:45] Earth he tells them he gives them a
[17:47] mandate to multiply and replenish the
[17:49] whole earth they just go out into the
[17:50] whole world and now and and then skip
[17:52] over to Genesis verse 10
[18:00] uh chapter 10 verse
[18:04] 10 verse 9 and 10 we've got somebody
[18:07] coming on the scene named uh Two Fellas
[18:11] Kush and
[18:14] Nimrod let's start at verse 8 chapter 10
[18:16] verse 8 and Kush begat Nimrod he began
[18:19] to be a mighty one in the earth he was a
[18:21] mighty Hunter before the Lord wherefore
[18:23] it is said even as nimra the mighty
[18:25] Hunter before the Lord and the beginning
[18:28] of his kingdom was Bible and Eric and
[18:30] aad and K in the land of
[18:34] Shar out of that land went forth Asher
[18:36] and build in Nineveh and the city
[18:38] reoboth and
[18:40] kala so we got two fellas named Kush and
[18:43] Nimrod they started something back there
[18:45] when when uh I got into reading hops 2
[18:48] babblin and and uh you know a lot of
[18:51] hops 2 babblin is quoted in the churches
[18:54] book
[18:56] and and um
[18:59] the his too batt and talks about who who
[19:02] Kush really was and it's there's a lot
[19:05] of many many proofs and a lot of
[19:07] citations and things in that book but to
[19:09] to make a long story short kosha goes by
[19:12] the name of baale who baale means Bel L
[19:15] not b a a l but Bel means the confounder
[19:19] say and and B Kush set himself up as the
[19:23] uh is The Interpreter of the Gods what
[19:25] he what he wanted to do was say well uh
[19:28] you know the the whole land the whole
[19:30] earth was after the flood was kind of in
[19:33] one Accord uh maybe as as close to
[19:36] communion as you could get they they
[19:38] believed in one God they they believed
[19:40] in you know they uh they were they were
[19:43] moving along right in the right
[19:45] direction and then Kush Rises up and
[19:47] says I'll tell you what God really wants
[19:49] to do and he wants to he wants to set up
[19:52] he wants to record we want to record our
[19:54] knowledge and and build this he built
[19:56] this uh he started the move to build the
[19:58] city
[19:59] of Nineveh and the Tower of Babel which
[20:01] his son carried on Nimrod uh who who uh
[20:07] goes by another
[20:09] name uh that uh I've got written down
[20:11] somewhere but I'll get to that in a
[20:13] minute so The
[20:15] Interpreter the The Interpreter of the
[20:17] Gods starts uh he he starts what he's
[20:20] doing is trying to get people out of
[20:21] communion with God and bring them into
[20:24] communion with him so now you can see
[20:26] that that move in the church today is it
[20:29] instead of being a Spirit-filled people
[20:32] he was trying to get them into more
[20:34] politics and humanism where they were
[20:37] you know church will always go off
[20:39] course if you get to where you you put
[20:42] in a pastor or uh uh deacons or whatever
[20:46] because of who is the most popular and
[20:48] who is the most friendly who is the
[20:50] nicest and the
[20:52] sweetest and who Rubes your your further
[20:55] right way because a lot of times you you
[20:58] is edifying the most edifying and the
[21:01] most needful to be sometimes to be
[21:03] delivered the word in in a scalding way
[21:06] you know in a way that burns your high a
[21:08] little bit may you send you home uh
[21:11] thinking about things because
[21:14] uh that what the the purpose of the
[21:19] purpose of the ministry is is to build
[21:22] up an a stature of of a perfect man to
[21:26] build up a church in God's image to
[21:28] bring Us in the communion and sometimes
[21:30] the best way to do that is not with with
[21:32] maybe uh uh slick talking and and a nice
[21:36] haircuts and things and and kissing
[21:39] babies and and doing everything just the
[21:41] way it seems for us to do but a real
[21:44] spirit filled church will will be led
[21:47] completely of the Lord and and and and
[21:50] and that's that's kind of what I'm
[21:52] getting at is that Nimrod you can see
[21:54] that Spirit everything that started in
[21:56] Genesis just carried on right all the
[21:58] way to Revelations you can see it all
[21:59] the way to
[22:01] Revelations is that and and and many
[22:04] churches today you know it's it it's
[22:07] just frightful when you go even to
[22:10] message churches sometimes and see like
[22:11] little Thrones set up and things like
[22:14] where where somebody in high Authority
[22:16] sits and then you got lesser people and
[22:19] then lesser people under that and then
[22:21] then then we're going to put the lady
[22:22] off like like they're
[22:24] nothing and that's that's exactly what
[22:26] Nimrod and Kush were trying to do was
[22:28] trying to separate the people from the
[22:30] ministry in such a way that the ministry
[22:33] is is some great people and and the L is
[22:36] nothing at all right Lord Jesus said
[22:39] that's why he had washing feet the
[22:41] ministry is actually
[22:43] uh really L because you know everybody's
[22:47] it's like waiting tables you're sitting
[22:50] down and and and I'm serving you that's
[22:53] right bringing you
[22:55] food and and it's actually the opposite
[22:58] the way the way many people think it
[23:00] it's not
[23:03] um I remember years ago I heard a little
[23:07] somebody uh was was staying with um uh
[23:12] some a couple of ministers while they
[23:13] traveled and he said he told me man they
[23:16] just all they do is read the Bible
[23:19] they're just it's like they're they
[23:21] they're laboring and and and really
[23:23] that's that's what it's about it's it's
[23:25] laboring to try to get and we get all
[23:28] motion excuse
[23:30] me trying to get people into God's image
[23:35] amen
[23:42] so because uh now now now how do you I'm
[23:46] not really trying to talk about Ministry
[23:48] so much but but now how do you remember
[23:51] we were talking about conversation one
[23:52] of the previous Sunday school lessons
[23:54] what is your conversation and we look at
[23:56] the word conversation cuz conversation
[23:58] you can't have real communion without a
[24:00] conversation the conversation
[24:03] is is uh uh in the Old Testament the old
[24:07] the Old Testament Hebrew word and the
[24:09] and the Greek word for conversation one
[24:11] of the one of the big meanings of that
[24:13] if you look at the strong concordance is
[24:15] is it your it's your way of life and and
[24:18] the Bible uses conversation a lot of
[24:19] times to mean the the of your life and
[24:23] now I ask really uh how do you tell if
[24:27] if the ministry is is not a nimrod it
[24:30] Nimrod and Kush were set up to they just
[24:34] had their own ideas and they and their
[24:35] message was it doesn't matter what God's
[24:38] word
[24:39] says but uh let's just do what feels
[24:43] right and and opposed to the real
[24:47] Ministry who uh the evidence of the real
[24:50] Ministry is in Hebrews
[24:52] 13:7 which we we like to quote Hebrews
[24:55] 13:8 but Hebrews 13:7 says remember them
[24:58] which have the rule over you cuz you
[25:00] know God does put by the spirit put
[25:03] people over you to see you into the
[25:05] Kingdom of Heaven to move you into the
[25:07] communion with God remember them which
[25:10] have the rule over you who have spoken
[25:12] unto you the word of
[25:14] God whose Faith follow
[25:18] considering the end of their
[25:20] conversation now that moves right on
[25:22] into Hebrews 13:8 because the end of
[25:24] your conversation has to be Jesus Christ
[25:28] the same yesterday today and forever but
[25:31] that's not just words right your
[25:34] conversation is your life that's right
[25:36] because it does not matter you know
[25:39] really Ministry is is just there's like
[25:41] an hour behind the pulpit but Ministry
[25:44] really starts when you step off the
[25:45] pulpit because nobody really it doesn't
[25:49] really matter what you say right it
[25:51] matters like a thousand times more what
[25:54] you live cuz you can I I can see that
[25:57] just looking around it's ministers that
[25:59] that don't live the life or or say
[26:02] things that cause people to question
[26:04] Christianity that has more of an effect
[26:07] than anything you could say that's right
[26:09] cuz people are looking at the life and
[26:12] that's what brother Wade has been
[26:14] talking about this is a life it's the a
[26:17] The Life of Christ brotherly kindness
[26:19] godliness patience Temperance how can
[26:22] you have those things unless you are
[26:24] growing in Grace and knowledge with God
[26:26] unless you're growing into a perfect
[26:27] commun with him that's
[26:34] right it's God's life in you that's
[26:37] right and that's
[26:39] what excuse
[26:41] me he's here right now
[26:47] amen the life is what caused Paul to be
[26:51] converted it wasn't so much the pillar
[26:53] of fire but he saw the life of God in
[26:57] stepen yeah
[26:59] yes right when he said no man by
[27:03] knowledge can say father forgive them
[27:08] hold not these things to their charge it
[27:10] had to be God in flesh
[27:13] amen and and that's why this cannot be
[27:17] impersonated you can't impersonate the
[27:19] life made
[27:21] manifest now we we we come to church and
[27:24] we hear we hear the truth and we hear
[27:26] that we all these talents and things
[27:28] have been given to us like at The
[27:29] Parables all these different things have
[27:31] been given to us so that we can grow and
[27:33] come into the perfect knowledge the
[27:36] perfect Faith a perfect stature of
[27:38] Christ and perfect
[27:40] communion and I'm going to stop right
[27:42] there I didn't even get halfway I didn't
[27:45] even get to my slides
