turn in your scriptures turn back where we've been in Ephesians 1 and then we will go to John 15 Ephesians 1 John 15 remember now the Lord will in the Bible study will be this coming Saturday 6:00 uh it's just more or less random questions so just bring your question and we will you know uh try to cover uh whatever we can on the questions of each individual that way we'll be you know just open it up and may go for a while that way I say remember then brother Quinn will be here preaching for the weekend so it'll be much in prayer for him and all and we're we're very proud today to have a new citizen of the United States amen truly Pastor T amen so she is now one of us she always was she yes she always was but she just now officially you know got the paperwork to where she can say she's a US citizen but we appreciate God you know being with her to give her all of the right answers and everything because it it does take a lot of it amen so remember these announcement any other announcements am I'm missing I you me forget something Ephesians 1 John 15 our precious Lord and our savior Our Redeemer our All In All In Jesus is your name thank you for all of the things things Lord that you've given unto us and you said you give them to us freely and we don't have to pay for nothing we don't have to work for it we don't have to do anything we just have to receive it Lord we thank you thank you for being with sister Trudy there and letting her get her citizenship papers and everything the work where all is well Lord we we thank you for all things we ask you to just bless each one you promised it cuz you said you sent your word and healed us and delivered us from destruction so we look into you and believing that Lord that you will take care of all things we love you and we thank you forgive our sins because we want to stand complete in you and just let the light of Your Love be in each one of our hearts we ask it all in Jesus name amen Ephesians 1 we've read this along we can read it do it by heart I guess K but still blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who has blessed BL us with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places in Christ that's right according as he had chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he hath made us accepted in the Beloved now I don't know where we'll get this far on this scripture with it but let's go to John 15 15 John 155 henceforth I call you not servants now what's what he's saying I call you not servants see he always called them servants coming down um the servants like the Abraham etc etc we're called servants now he's fixing to change and going over you know and and call us something else but he says I henceforth call you not servants for the servant knoweth not what his Lord doeth but I've called you friends for all things that I have heard of my father I have made known unto you he have not chosen me but I have chosen you and ordained you that you should go for go should go and bring forth fruit and that your fruit should be should remain that whatsoever you shall ask of the father in my name he may give it you you may be seated the Lord at his Blessing to the reading of the word I know you've already prayed for him but just remember especially brother Dale catch there in the time of having the cancer and the things you know you know the Lord would touch him now I I told you what I was going to do there this past weekend and uh you know I was going to just more or less preach a kind of an overall view of what I was going to be covering and you know we gave a few quotes in but not to just sit down and grind you know and U to uh have an understanding cuz that's what we we need we need understanding uh more than anything in the world even if it's just natural understanding because that way then God can Quicken it unto our Hearts you know and he can reveal it cu the disciples their their understanding was open and then they went from there to the upper room and received the new birth which would give them eternal life but not only that it would bring to their remembrance what he said you know and in other words reveal what he had said unto them cuz that wasn't done when he just opened her understanding but you know uh I I want our understand it open I believe that we have the message as I kept saying we're not looking for another message to come and when I put that in there this past Sunday on it that you know the bride and and Christ would unite to bring the message it's definitely not another message we're talking about right because we have the message see and that's that's where it's at so we are not looking for that but we're looking for things in the message to be revealed uh you know like we we we had the Bible before the prophet came right right and and we didn't get another Bible right after the prophet came you know we we we uh you know we just get an opening of our understanding but then I want that revealed to where you know that I can uh can walk there in and and thank God for the the prophet being sent to bring the message unto us all right now we read here in Ephesians and that was what our thought is and we'll use it for a while chosen in him really there in the Scripture it says chosen Us in him specifically stating us you know and uh because brother Brown said that the church at Ephesus could stand strong meat and this wasn't written to The Sinner you know for the sinner to understand this was written to those that were in Christ and who were uh walking in the word greater than uh some of the other places in positions because you know that was the uh that was was what was to be done there but now notice now we we we tried to bring out something so I want to keep on that until you see what I'm talking about if you get bored by it just take a couple of nights off and don't come that's you or either come here and sleep just do your way you want to you can you can handle it but I pray to those that sleep that they will go back and listen to the tapes and things you know and try to get an understanding but now I told you when I started that series on the uh predestination and the things and coming down to uh adoption and then going through you know in the uh dealings that I wanted to get back and speak from Ephesians 1 there because that was what the Lord started revealing some things to me and uh you know I want to make sure that you understand what I'm saying about it and then it's up to God to reveal it to you but we read that we were chosen in him right and that the choosing was done before the foundation of the world right all right so it could not be in any form what we do or don't do because the choosing was done before we got here and that's what he said about um you know ES and Jacob said before they were even born right or anything you see he had already you know uh set forth that he loved Jacob and hated Esau all right now we can get into the long lengthy point of it of predestination for knowledge Etc and and I said now don't let this in any way destroy the point of former forn knowledge of God and and you know and and predestinate by his for knowledge but remember as I was trying to say Sunday when you say for knowledge that means knowledge existing before but it it it's not knowledge before something is known it it it it means that it means for knowledge in other words knowledge before that it would take place right all right but it doesn't it doesn't do away with what's going to take place because it's got to take place if it wasn't it wouldn't be for knowledge all right then he predestines according to his for knowledge all right that's all well and good and we're we're still there and we're not losing anything about it because remember I gave you a piece of paper with the lines of you know eternity and time and things on it and and trying to illustrate it a little to bring it down but see we're over here we're over here in a Time belt right all right trying to comprehend an eternal God and that's hard to do because it's it's not according to our mental mind all right but we just have to believe what God says and then he sent us a prophet to tell us what he said was right right you say well we didn't need a prophet to tell it was right we could read it well why did we have trinitarian Doctrine why did we have eternal hells and why why did we have all of these other things why did we have all of that if we didn't need no profit now but see we we we show up our own selves but notice now I kept emphasizing that we were chosen in him right not by him right because if you're chosen by him then you would run it into a respector persons all right now I hope you followed this one point I tried to emphasize as much as possible that you could say but now what is what is for knowledge was is he looked down here and saw we want to be saved so we had it with Forest amen amen I agree with you but you realize that God will not override your freem moral agency so he will not save you if you do not want to be saved right all right so then if we just say well it's all just by for knowledge well then it's for knowledge that you made a choice cuz if you didn't choose him he's choosing of you now he's going to have to override you three more ages see if he makes he take it you see we we we want to lay on it till we think we understand but do we understand I mean is there something like me comes along and Blast away all of our thoughts about it you know well maybe that's what I'm supposed to do you know to make US settle down to think about it you know even error sometimes is good because it'll it'll it'll make you you know there must needs to be heres among you they that are approve may be made manifest the Bible says so then if I'm in error maybe it'll help you but you know I don't believe so I I believe that I see something and I'm trying to break it down into human language and and break down the barriers that we've had about our language our our brains being sealed off and and set like I heard a man say one time he said our thoughts are crystalized on this well now you know what crystalized break shoes are yeah you throw them away I mean you can sand them all you want to CU we had you T to do that I know you know when we was young we had to take them and they get Christian Life a little and we we buff them and they work for a little while right but they still was no good they come right back you know but see if you're christianized on something that means you're not going to listen right amen you say well I know about how the choosing was and I know how the predestination is and I'm just not going well you you won't get anything because I'm going to say it and I know it hurts feelings like this but 99% of that that people who would think that way was people that says I believe in a trinity and no way you're going to convince me no other way well now you might out argue them and get them into the message but what do you got you got trinitarians in the message cuz they're here amen and that's I get some tickled about say like the River Jordan people and and they they say y'all ain't nothing but a bunch of Oneness well if you got Jesus wasn't God to the River Jordan you had Tess see and you're saying we're Oneness well I don't to be Oneness that's closer to the truth than Tess you know but anyhow I I'm not upset with nothing I've got to the point that I just see that people are not going to understand unless God reveals it and we'll get back to that scripture where that Jesus said you know that no man can come unto me unless the father draws him we'll get to that eventually and bring it out but I was trying to dwell upon the basis of chosen in him and like I said if he looked down through time and he saw you make a choice with you did all right see now he saw you make a choice well then where's your chosen in him right that would be chosen by him see if he sits back here and he he looks through time and he sees you making the choice he sees you wanting to be saved all right then he he's dealing upon what you want so he's dealing upon your choice you know I said right questions down about it I'd love to talk to you about it but see the Bible said we were chosen in him right amen all right and brother R said now when he was chosen we chosen right I gave you that quote but see then all I was trying to get an expression to you about is and I said don't lose all this thing because God did look down through time that's predestination is to sit back here and be able to be God and look all the way down through and see everything that's perfectly right see and then it all comes into view see if we take a a onesided view and we bring everything and put it all up into here and and leave it up there that we don't have a choice because look at Paul he just didn't have a choice he got knocked down was made take it now I don't agree with that right I don't believe it I'm just you know but see then if we go to the other side of it well it was all in what we chose see well now you're going both ways see you're going to a basis of losing the the Bible and you can't use the quotes that brother random uses backwards and forth right but if we look at it correctly then look what a marvelous thing it is I wanted that that at the end of the service but I know I took so much time on the other I didn't have time to explain it you know your children are your children right whether good or bad whatever they are they're your children there's no way to deny I mean who who in the world wouldn't want to deny a child of theirs even the worst that it could be that wouldn't want to deny their child you know uh there would be no form of that in my mind uh I wouldn't maybe agree with my children about a lot of things but I there's no way in the world that any of them could ever sin enough to make me if word that I wouldn't have let the world know that I was their father well you mean murder yeah there's just no way well because they're my children they're my Offspring all right and see but the point of it is there's still your children right and you love them but what about when you're this like we are as a family it just wonderful to me now brother uh brother Quinn I think was the one that said it I'm not certain but somebody said one day at the house said Brother D just sit there and looked at you said you were just sitting there looking over cuz we do we get together at the house and we'll just everyone be in the living room and we're just laughing and talking and having a big time and just just going on you know and eating together and fellowshipping and and he said I was looking at you and said you're just looking over your heritage and you was grinning I said yeah cuz I'm very proud of my Heritage of my family right I'm very proud that they have chose to first to serve the Lord that's the number one two they have chosen to try to be good at least human morally you know and they they wanted work for a living they they they want to do and they want to to to help and and do anything and they're good to help other people and you know what that makes me think a lot of them right I'm I'm I'm hoping that um that was part of my point and my life's part of being instilled into them you know as to to the way of going all right and you know that makes me very proud well my point is this that when God looks down if he just made you do something and then you done it because you say well God you made me do it I've done it anyway there's no rewards there right H he's not pleased with that form of a child right but he's pleased with one when they see the word and want to follow the word and want to you know learn the word and and and walk in the word that makes him very proud of his children you know and you say well is he proud well he was so proud with job until he said Satan have you considered my servant joob he's proud of that you know what he's fixing to do turn him loose let the devil get him right right you know what he's very proud of him sure he could look through at the end and see what job was going to do but job couldn't so he had to let job make the choice and let job live the life and and come to it to where he could come to him and contact him but he was very pleased for that right God is pleased to to let us go through trials and troubles and problems and heartaches and to see us come out of it acting correctly and as we always say then if we don't then we just get another test you know we're going to go back through it again in all until we get the whole thing correctly the way God wants it all but see that way I was trying to make the emphases that by you choosing God you say but we didn't choose God God chose us I know the Bible we went through that I know what the prophet is saying but also know that he don't override your free more agency so he gave you a choice and you made the right choice Danny Henry to brother Brown you've made the right choice because of this a great portion of Heaven AWA you Abraham you've made a great choice I'll make you the father of Nations Abraham made a choice he didn't have to leave what was it g what it was there he didn't have he didn't have to leave out of that place he could have stayed right there but see God told him you won't go do that he said I'm going to do it that's my whole part of a Christian Life is we do have something to do with it on this side now salvation no salvation's of the lord we didn't save ourselves for being good that's my whole point I'm trying to get to you he didn't look down through there and see how good we would be and say I'll save dick out because I know he'll be good now he looked down and seen how bad he was but then he looked down there and he saying well all I got to do is cross his path he may not jump all at once and grab everything but I cross his path well he also knew that he could cross everybody else's pth and I told you and I believe it that brother around said everybody has got that longing within them every human being because of a soul that's in that individual you go to the hot and tots of Africa to where they've never seen a or he of Jesus Christ or God or anything like they're worshiping Idols they're worshiping animals they're they're because of a soul that's within that individual that's right that longs after the Creator because they realize they're creation you see then that's the whole thing but now let's get down into see we tried to cover that we were chosen in him all right now I ask you a simple question who's the himy you remember that was a simple question if we were chosen in him who's the himym now we know that we are chosen and and we know that that you know it's only uh to to line up the word correctly that if somebody made a choice see well what do we use the word choice about see we say we were chosen in him okay who's the him right and then who was the one that made the choice for this other seemingly person or whatever to to make a choice it seem like trinitarianism right so then our word choice or choosing is not always the way that we think it is see all right are you with me now if there any problem raise your hand there I'll go back through it and just do the best I can because I want you to understand this we were chosen in him who's the himym see if you're if you're total Oneness you cannot comprehend the Bible right but if you're a trinitarian you can't comprehend the Bible and surely we don't want to go in the middle saying I'm a God in three persons you cuz that's trinitarianism but who's the himym that's a simple question question well questions gender Strife you know you quote scripture can't you yeah the round set of church questions made have strong church right so it evidently is not what we think it is on that basis it's all right to ask questions cuz that's way we learn so who's the himy we know for certain that we were chosen in somebody cuz it says him now what it him is a pronoun but it means a takes the place of a noun so we know that what we're talking about here is chosen in Christ right am now see it's like I said I didn't have enough time Sunday I would just laid a foundation to go across come back now we know we wasn't chosen in Jesus right the flesh right right now we will get to it later that we were in him amen well he was in flesh or we will never be all right now but Jesus the flesh man wasn't back there right so we were chosen in Christ right all right and did God make a decision to send somebody else down to fulfill his plan and purpose or did he come himself that's right so then we talk about the great Elohim the self-existing one who dwelt alone and see then we take the prophet's message because that's the only way we have of doing it we're not theologians who can go back but even the the great things I like to read even scoffield will will have enough to understand that that he would call the the the first part that would come out of God he would call it the L go speech or word our son of God cuz they had that much understanding about the terminologies of words right but see we were chosen in him all right now as I said did God look down in Christ did he choose him to come or was that him that came in another form amen all the great teachings read Around May about it right amen it was not another God right the great Pillar of Fire that went out the logos the theophany the the the speech the word was not another God it was God in another form called a son he said or called Christ all right so now then it's not one choosing another one to do that's why we we use the word choose like meaning that you know I I'll choose brother klie but I I won't choose Brother Anderson see that's choosing that's that's us doing it but what about a God could look down through time and see himself existing in time in both of the individuals at the same time amen that's a whole lot different see chosen not somebody's choosing will I no he chose to to condescend is that the way the prophet brought it right God chose to condescend Down to Earth all the way down through tooking 4,000 years through the Old Testaments descending through the pillar of fire the thing and finally coming into flesh and he chose to do that but that didn't end his choosing because in him could be all the attributes of healer savior all like that but somebody had to be sick somebody had to be lost so then the parts that would take care of the rest of it is not just a foolish virgin a group of people or people up on earth that could grab something and and they do and that's wonderful that they get healings and things see but God ch CH to come this way amen all right and when he look down upon that form of himself cuz that's where people don't I don't mean Brother Gary we get into this pretty heavy sometimes but you see I have no trouble whatsoever with one form of God praying to another form of God form you understand what I said cuz Jesus prayed right he prayed to his father and he was God manifested in flesh you say well he just praying inside of him no he didn't say he was he said his father was in heaven that's right right and he was speaking to him and he prayed mightily to his father even to the basis of saying you know if it possible let this cut pie from me you say well that was just the flesh all right God was in that flesh but see then I don't have any trouble with looking back at God as before the world the great Elohim the great self-existing and realize that there's things about God that we're not going to receive while we're in this world and that's what your Prophet said that's right he said he would give us a message of cheer down to in the sages if it wasn't for these quotes I couldn't preach what I'm preaching right cuz none of us would have any common sense to even talk about it but by saying what he says that we're not we're just getting enough of God here enough understanding and thing to me is when we get there to be able to understand am that's right and you know it's just a a way of looking at something so then he chose to condescend and his first condescending was in theophany our word form to be able to create right now we know and I've been over and over we brother said who this mes we bassed arthop right all right because that was a word body that was standing there not just a myth or a form or whatever it's a word body we didn't come that way as individual people but if we wasn't in him how will we ever have eternal life foolish virgins and people like that can be given eternal life but they there have no part to do with him and it's only by impartation it is not by a new birth a lot of difference in in an impartation of eternal life or be given something then someone to receive it right but you see then if we were chosen in him when he was hearing the word if we wasn't in that word the prophet said we'll never be here that's right amen he said that was all my Mighty God in another form amen now listen to what I'm saying did God look down and see his son do the way he wanted him to do it and said I chose him come on no come on that's what I'm trying to get you to see right he didn't look down and see him and say oh no right he's my son bless him and these others are my sons too so I'll choose him he choose the rest of them oh no that's what I'm saying do we understand one God if that word formed theop whatever you want to call it back Son of God that stood before the world and said let there be if that was not almighty God then where we at that's right amen eat drink B but see if that was almighty God then it was the form he was using right and then when it says in him dwelt the fullness of the godhead bodily we believe that and your Prophet says a bride in the end time she will be the fullness of the godhead bodily you believe those quotes amen but does that do away with God when we say oh God was he poured into Christ does that do away with God no that's what we think we think it's like taking water it's in a GL we poured over another glass there it is then we say all God all Christ in the church we take that and pour it over in another GL we got two empty gles to throw away I don't see it that way I'm sorry I don't see it that way I see every time God open that GL and pour it over into another that it magnifies him that it increases him that it make him greater and greater because he got more offsprings more ability to express himself right I've always told you he could give every person over 7 billion in the world today he could give every person in the world today eternal life would that do away with God no that would multiply right that would multiply God there's something coming up now and I don't understand it so I'm going go ahead and say it as best I can all right I'm just telling you I don't but this is going through my mind we are the body of Christ is that the Bible right H members in particular right one a hand un a foot this you know right because we're the body of Christ all right the same Bible says that we are his wife right that we're the bride of Christ right right the same Bible says that we are God made manifest amen now that's I mean that's how many things can we put in there that the Bible will show us to be right come on right true right but you said we're just the same people we're members of his body right he's the head of the body right right we are his wife his bride right we's children right mhm does that make it confusing if it does we need to pray right her the said something something's going to unfold her and and I wait for that because I realize it amen see because we've got to see all of the things that we are come on but to see that we are exactly what we are is what I was trying to express Sunday amen we're not another God that's right right we're not another person that's right it's either God made manifest in a bride form which is the body of Christ which is the children of God is all in all to be one are we sure have missed a whole plane amen right so then as we read and we study then don't get confused about well that's just say we're about it but see we were chosen in him and when he was in word form who was he almighty God Amen with an Earthly terminology is being used of calling him the word you know human words we can call him Loos theophany Etc as I said then there he was in that theophany word body standing there looking to me just exactly like he looked when he was back there with with with Abraham and when Moses saw the back part and the same one that stood on the shores of Galilee right amen and then brother RAM and the Bible said if we wasn't in him when he walked ashore of Galilee we never will be in him amen see right you see why it's took so many years to preach the the godhead to the place that we can understand right we've needed all these 40 years or more to try to express the the point of trying to get it down to understand see we looked at that like we're chosen him well he chose Jesus and Jesus chose us where in him that's what it is let's go home oh we really Glory Hallelujah we know all about it amen that's as trinitarian as any trinitarian Doctrine could ever be did you choose in any way to be who you are I'm doing natural now now brother Dean did you figure out some way to be able to make it down to what you look like you look I don't think so not meaning he's ugly and won't need something help changeing but you know get you to life a little where you'll think we didn't have anything to do with our natural choosing right we never had anything to do with our spiritual choosing now we're back before the world okay we done been over here on this side and see that we must choose him we must accept him we must do those things that's got to be done but then we'll see that all the time it was him coming after us that's right right that's it did Jesus have a choice of being Jesus or was he almighty God which one is it he was either almighty God or the biggest deceiver of the world ever seen the prophet said and see see that holds together the one God as we talked about the Oneness see they say he's one like a finger are Jesus was the final form of God well I don't agree with that I believe the bride of Christ is the final form of God on this side of the earth you know this side of the time gaps and and even we're going to be so great until even the the foolish virgins will get eternal life and even the fifth still Jews and the things that goes to them they still will not be the Bride of Jesus Christ that's right amen they will still not be his body they will still not be his offspring they will only have eternal life by impartation right and if you and I hadn't to come the way we did they wouldn't be here how would they got here if it had been a fall in the garden and for us to come the way we come how would anybody be here that doesn't have eternal life today how they would they be here right it's not in right God's plan and purpose was to reveal himself to man his own creation all right now was he trying to reveal himself to his creation Now listen or was he trying to reveal himself to his children and we know we are his creation okay you get the point one saying did he just choose to reveal himself to all mankind no he chose to reveal himself to his children and all mankind then could reap the benefits of that being done he didn't come to save all the world he would that they would be saved right mhm but he come to save only those now we're going to get back to a little word and I'm not going to spend much time on it tonight because take a whole message what does redeem mean right it means to go back where you came from that's right Amen brother Rand said only the predestinated is considered in Redemption right only the Seed of Abraham what is the seat of Abraham not not Jews the faith seat of Abraham do you see why it's so much of trying to express and to explain and I do it doesn't matter to me if I spend six months on this one thought as long as we get it and understand what is being said it'll open the entire Bible the prophet's message will open all the things things will open if we just realize who we are and what we're doing and then we can see that yes we was he was here in this world and we as young people or something maybe in Life or S and and and we started crying and praying for God to save us and come find out it was God choosing us God seeking us the goodness of God the scripture said lead is repentance not teaching my wife and I were talking today about this that you know most preachers preach about how bad everything is and they preach on dress and hair and clothes and wrong to be a homosexual and wrong to be a a this and a wrong to be that and you ought not be a Muslim and you ought not be a Hindu and you ought not be a you ought not be none of these you know we need to all be Christians but there former Christianity is believing there word are them why don't you preach the gospel brothers and get the people converted I thought it was preaching the G the gospel I thought Jesus was the Gospel I mean I I didn't know it was our dos and DS was the Gospel I thought it was Jesus Christ see that's why I Don't Preach like these other preachers preach I'm I'm just sorry you get you another one cuz yeah I'm just not made to preach like that I didn't get saved that way way I didn't get saved by somebody telling me how bad I was I didn't have any trouble I already knew it that's right that's right didn't you right I sure didn't think I was going to heaven because how good I was right that's when I was 18 years old for I even converted to baptist church because I seen what the way they were trying to bring us they were not trying to bring us to Christ they were trying to bring us to a church or a group or a situation or some Doctrine or rules or regulations or some Creed to quote that's why I told them you know I've told you many times when they come to me about coming to church I said listen I'll live a better life as a sinner than a lot of your Deacon board does and but they wouldn't argue with me about it cuz they knew that I could quote pretty good about their Deacons and you know what I found one day where the Prophet made a statement about it and I realized that was me he said you know you got to get over the church to be saved now don't ask me to do that a paraphrase form but you got to get over the church to be saved right and I realized that was what the problem was you know what was in my way the church right I I'm honest and tell you when I joined that Baptist Church I had to come to that realization Lord get back get get away let me get from this that's their business between me and you lord it's not me and you and all the how good they are right but you see oh get off of it blessing God chose to condescend all right and I got a quote in here somewhere I got one at the house where brother around and said God God knew his first little bride in the garden Eve would fall he knew that or else he wasn't God but here's the rest of the story he said he knew but there was a bride that was predestinated not to fall you see we got to get saved before we have the ability to fall right but you see he condescended downward to reveal himself as I said sure a whole world has the ability to to the the people that's never heard have a longing within their heart and a a desire to serve some form of a Creator no matter how much they call them themselves atheist I call them idiots because if you're if you say you're an atheist and don't believe in God you believe you're greater than God so that solves a problem but you see he knew that this would be but he knew there was a little rde he knew there was a little and the brother ROM was covering the story a lot right that there was a little old Eagle that had a couple of eggs right she knew she had a coup of eggs one of them got missing now you didn't tell both got missing now you have a problem one of them got missing and wound up in a chicken yard that's where we were he knew he had children that would wind up in this world in a lost condition doomed and on our way to hell cuz we would be mortal people under sin you can't make an eternal sinner right don't try to give eternal life to a sinner no it doesn't work cuz you have an eternal sinner you see then as he would do that then that little Eagle would be an attribute of God right that little Eagle was a child of that eagle that was flying right with no chicken never was a chicken just born to a chicken that's right well brother Dale the only problem with the way you bring things you bring it down to we always was eternal now I've never taught you that so you don't go off I've always taught you and I'll give you the quotes through here in a little bit if I have time don't we'll take them up next Wednesday or whenever we get back you know yourself that I've always told you you got to taught you you got to have the new birth to be to have eternal life so don't think you come into the world with eternal life in you that you don't need eternal life you come into the world with a seat of representation from predestination that God knew you would want eternal life and he had it for you but that didn't mean you come into the world with eternal life you I got quote well go ahead and quote all right go on just remember you're going to come back to the bases that the prophet said you get eternal life right here at the altar you're going to come back to the bases were we Spirits brother random no we wouldn't nothing right we were just in his thinking right so you're going to have to come back and face those or you going to have to say he was wrong on them so go do what you want to you ain't going to change I'm not trying to change nobody I'm trying to preach the gospel let God convert us all you see what I'm talking about what is an attribute we hit it just a little bit I want to hit it just a little bit tonight what is an attribute now brother random said in God was attributes he said it was in him to be a Healer to be a savior to be a deliverer to be all of the things we see the Bible The Advocate the the unction the the teachers the the all the things that we would ever find in the Bible that would be related to God would be an attribute of God and he had that before the world ever begun right right he didn't become a Healer he just displayed that that healing Factor he didn't become a savior he displayed that upon Earth see but yet in him was attribute what is an attribute say it's a part of God he said it's a part of God I got a quote in here we'll get to it minute we don't I'll get to it later butom said that Jesus was a offspring of God well that's two people see that's father son not if that Offspring is God that's right you ain't got two people that's right now get what I'm talking about attributes so we just going to go through these things and if I have to I'll take months on just each one of the words just one thing at a time and don't bother me we've had 40 something years I don't think you ought to worry about it now you know maybe we're getting old enough to sit down and listen maybe we've run our course enough to to get through things I got some tickle the other day hearing brother Brown when even said it you get it listen to it he explains the four stages of life he said from 1 to 25 25 to 50 50 to 75 75 to 100 he said it's all right down here on that 1 to 25 if you out running around after women that may be a paraphrase but it's you know well I always tell you you marry 90% of marriage is harmonal factors how you say those words you know you know no it was love at first sight no no it was it was harmones working in both of you then you learn to love right right amen all right you know you Mar lust you say no we made you see you don't understand me so go ahead you know it's true but listen if we are his attributes right yeah then his attributes are Eternal right that's what I said I won't preach on the you say but oh I got you now cuz ain't no such thing as Eternal he you better back up just a little bit and wait cuz one of these days these body's going to be changed that'll be Eternal healing if you don't want take that far but you're healing if you're healed today and die tomorrow you were eternally healed today I'll get back and preach on that one of these years cuz I just saw what brother R he said even as a Healer is he he's Eternal see that's why we don't look at it that way we quote by strip I hope I'm Healed my I think I'm Healed my maybe I'm Healed that's why we're not healed but when we look at it just as well as we say but we don't dare do that about our Salvation right we don't dare say I think I'm saved I hope I'm sa maybe I'm safe but one you know we don't do that now we don't we've got away from that we want anchor that in good cuz that that has to do with eternity but if the atonement is made I thought by his stripes we were healed the same as one my transgression Bru for iniquity with the stries for he I thought was all one atonement he eternally healed us I know you can be sick and you need healing again I know all about that but you're not listening see we're talking about eternal life Jesus was the very attribute of God you know why cuz he was God right he was God because he was that attribute he was love he was Joy he was all the thing all that was in God is placed into Christ right not another God I mean if I've going thises y'all just go ahead but I've never heard of oness preached like this so I'm not worried about it but listen look at your first note you got there and I told you now that I was going to be using the new 21 version okay the uh what they call it the table that what it's called the table it's a new version because of transfer having to transfer everything over here to be be able to get into the computer system all right because it it just won't work trying to put all of our stuff in other words brother Joe's got to go back there and go into the message get it over here come back over here and get it over here pull it back over here to be able to get it in the message so I I've changed and I'm using that and the reason you'll know you look out there at the beginning right up there you see that little thing look like a speaker well what that means is if you got that version and you can connect on you can just click on that around and read that to you right that's what that little speaker thing means if you just click on it and he'll read it to you yeah know and and things so it'll help you but you know if anybody would like to get the other version of the 2010 I you know we will try our best to to help you to get what uh you know you want and while I'm talking about on the Jenson book I I told him the other day at home that we would buy all the books for anybody that wants the books the Jorgenson book the number six we will buy the book but now if you want to consider I mean the CDs that goes with it you're going to have to buy it so you know go ahead and tell sister Lisa whatever and if you want it say well I can't afford it you you do we'll buy the book for you but we won't buy the the CDs cuz they're a little more expensive to have to buy those MP3s orever what it's on but all right we'll do that but listen look what your Prophet had to say now on the message identifi Christ of all ages preached in 1964 401 which would be paragraph 1 go down to the middle what's underlined he is now in you you are his attributes watch it if you've got eternal life now there's a question right your life always was now that's not your natural life right that is not your natural life what I think that's my natural I know and that's not I'm sorry what you need Jesus for if you don't know those things listen and you was God's thinking listen to it the color of your hair now Sister I'd be careful about dying man original color you're not going to be a brunette here in the world and get over there and be in a glorified body and be blackheaded that's right Ain certainly ain't going to be great so you know go ahead I'm say men too cuz a lot of men die their high too so that's just as well you know so the Bible says you can't add one high to your what is ITB one cubit see you can't add a high to you cuz God's W to give you all that well then you can't add any colors cuz going to come back original you may fool us while you're here but when we get over there choice we going to know it's the same color okay get you the life a little bit to raise you up Mr all right sometimes you get this kind of typ all right listen he is now in you you are his attributes if you got eternal life your life always was and you was God's thinking the color of your high whatever you are you was God's thinking and you're just materialized and that's what God was when he was materialized in Christ amen God displayed manifested in flesh in Christ he became material that we could touch see then he goes to First Timothy going through all though he we're his attributes and an attribute of God is eternal all right well see we didn't come into the world with eternal life if we did we don't need Jesus right all that would be in vain see all you need to know is a knowledge you have eternal life I believe we must come here and rece receive eternal life but that eternal life that you receive always was eternal right right we won't get to it tonight but we got a lot of it in here always was eternal Jesus was God's attribute and we are just God's attribute did display now we're not going to hurt nobody's feelings I hope you see the foolish virgin giv eternal life is not an attribute of God that's an attribute that would be displayed because of the situation of life that we exist in and you know be given unto them you understand it right so they're not part of it everybody in the world is a child of God by creation amen right by creation God permitted us to come into flesh no matter how many billion trillions of what they are in the world never will be but we're not talking about that we're talking about his children amen the children as I said a moment ago you can believe in birth control all you want to I laugh at people who talk about birth control no just remember when you start talking about your birth control I'm laughing at you I don't mean that wrong I just mean it's truth we're going to be held accountable for what we do with the functions we have of the abilities whatever you want to call it without getting too far into it but you tell me there's going to be a bunch of bodies left up there you know around here in the world and there ain't no souls to put in them or there's a bunch of souls you know and and no bodies going to go in now I don't agree with that who was it now some of you you don't have to tell who it was but it's around here that that there was a man and a woman both both of them had the what they VI sectomy for the man and whatever you call it tubes tied for the woman both of them had and you know now they got a child you said well what it was she was slipping around well her tubes got untied some way you know right say no such thing as birth control I said we will be responsible for what we do with the functions that God give us but there's no such thing as birth control we can't control birth God controls birth now I keep saying it we'll be responsible for what we do with things you say bless God I'm we just ain't going to have no kids well you might get a surprise one day you know yeah those things do happen you Butz I don't think we're in a modern civilization I remember a brother here one time preaching how that Joseph you know when he went down to SL into slavery you know and down into Egypt for slavery said see they always cerated all the slaves you know I just I I got up behind him I said I just can't help it but I said come find out you had two kids they must have known some way to restore that ceration that's not a joke it's just showing we don't play with God but don't play with his word either cuz it'll face us right we think this looks good because we read it they C they you know all the servants had to be and then come find out Joseph was a servant and there he was why was Piper's wife after him if he was just right come on but you see we think we know what we're talking about because we've heard this brother so so talk I don't care who s it you me or who it is what does it say about the word come on right all right now we believe that Jesus was a very attribute of God cuz he was God all right you and I are the display upon Earth as by salvation now receiving salvation we become the attributes of God upon Earth amen called The Bride the body the church the people the children the the all of those words we were using while ago the right husband I mean the wife the the the bride right but you see then that doesn't make trinitarianism right cuz you're not one person and God another that's right you got a problem there right if he was God made manifest in flesh by the new birth we become God made manifest in flesh I believe that's is where our human mind can't follow that strong enough you say brother you get a little too strong no that's not strong enough oh my all right do we believe that point and let me get another one then we'll tied up on this one you believe that Jesus was an offspring of God yes all right now was he a Son of God a second person no or was he God made manifest in another form right called a son right that's and that would make him an offspring now the Bible says he's the only begotten of the father right amen right now he was begotten by impartation by creation by who he was now I'm quoting brother randam he was an offspring of God God in another form called a son right he was the only begotten the scripture says so now we wasn't in him in how he was begotten you agreed while to go now are you still agreeing with me if we wouldn't in him the only way to have eternal life how was he begotten now naturally he was begotten into the wound and not brought the body of Mary right but spiritually he was begotten in the form that he stepped over into to become the word that's right yes sir so he's the only begotten you know what you and I begotten by him now but wait a minute Brother D I've heard you say 4,000 times that we're not a son of Jesus that we a Son of God I'll say it again we're not a son of Jesus a Son of God there's no such thing cuz that make Eternal sunship we don't agree with it but see he had in him what we have have to have to be a child of God Amen you agree he had in him what I have to have he was begotten and if I wasn't in him that way I never will be right so I gave you a quote that word brother R gives it on U believest thou this 1950 7:16 remember Jesus had all the qualiity of the father in him do you believe that sure he did all the fine gifts of God was in Christ his son for he was The Offspring of God he goes on to say I see he didn't use any of his gifts against Satan he used the word because he knew how to handle it all right but he was The Offspring of God what a wonderful thought God having children but see we're tied up into the human element of our thinking right for me to have a child I had to have a wife sensible no problems right I mean it generally takes two like brother Bown said that's why that they can't do it with all this business about said you know remember talking to man said well what it was said it was just a polywog and then it was this and the W and he said now according to your science it takes a male and a female to bring forth a child whatever you want to call it worms whatever whatever the me yeah that's right he said but then who was the who was the wife of the pow walk you know in other words where did the polywog come from had to be a male and female something to bring a polywog right cuz you tou a male to female to bring a child right see and the man couldn't answer it see because it destroyed his poliwog his poliwog was just a one form ofia what do you call it amiba family one side well then how can a one-sided thing ever produce a two-sided oh it just rolled over on this other side and grow an AR that grow over here and roll gr a lag yeah but listen he was an offspring he was God in another form amen right and whatever I said that I have to have and even me being I had to be there brother BR said we walked the shores of Galilee in him now click your mind was James and John and Peter and them they was walking beside of him right Hallelujah but Jesus said I chose you right you was in me come on now what was that talking about not the human flesh it was standing right there walking Al long see we can get over into the great understanding that we are over here where we could have been some way genetic you know no then Peter James and John and then was standing right there beside of him right but you see what was in him is what Peter needed right you agree right what was in Jesus was eternal life amen right right and that's what Peter needed to make him a child right that's three years of so in the ministry that it took the Lord Jesus to get Peter and him ready to be able to bring him forth his child is to bring children on the earth on the day of Pentecost to where he could expand himself right and bring it forth okay now we back up cuz we're not going to be able to finish it let me just get that next one number three on your notes and then we'll get back we'll come right back to this Offspring and you just keep these notes and you know if you don't we'll print off some more but keep them if you candle next Wednesday brother said an identified Masterpiece of God preaching 19 in human Arizona 1964 125 now we notice that God begin to make him a bride for Christ so and the bride must be identified with him and in him because it is part of him now the bride is part of him right she is part of him the word for that day the bride becomes part of that word for it's Christ and you believe that congregation says amen I ain't heard amen yet okay we have to be in Christ in Christ we have to be of Christ in Christ part of Christ right now I I didn't miss reading that you all right what what did he say where we have to be of Christ in Christ part of Christ am I don't leave nothing out do it that brings us over in this world we can accept Jesus Christ as our savior and we can be of Christ and we can be up in Christ and we can be back before the world and we can have the Morning Star sing together the sons of God sh for joy we can have all of that so what is a woman when she takes a man or a man takes a woman that woman has to be part of him there are no longer two there one and when God and Christ became one they were one because God was the word and the Word was made flesh and the Flesh and the word became one and when the church becomes Christ bride she and the gospels are the same how can you say then the days of Miracles is passed how can you say it when you're a part of him now couple years down the road we get back on that quote how can you say the days of Miracles has passed if you're a Christian okay brother R said a Christian believes in the Supernatural right believes in the Supernatural right a Christian how can a Christian say the days of Miracles has passed see where we get into trou will say I just don't see much going on well are we doubting God I see the greatest of all things taking place a bride getting ready to meet her savior am learning about him like uh who is it Ruth no excuse me um La eer going after a bride bringing back Rebecca okay I'll get the right name when Rebecca got there she knew so much about what he looked like she didn't have to be told she jumped off the camel and took off running she saw him out in the field she knew who that was she knew if he sent after her she didn't have to put on no gown she didn't have to take a bath right remember this would have had to been somewhere up in the day and she rode that Camel that day you ever smelled a camel we were over in Israel and uh there were selling things you know well I asked the fell and he said this is a camel belt I said how in the world I know that thing was made from a camel he said here smell of it you solve the problem but I had a chance to ride on the camel for a few minutes 3 months after woman rode that Camel I don't care whether the two hump or one hump or what how many humps it had this is the way we went I wanted it to run wide open cuz maybe it would smooth out but that sucker was just like that 3 months now you know what I'm talking about just trying to be sensible if they got up in the morning and they started riding and maybe they rode 2 hours or 4 hours or 8 hours or how many hours she smelt like everything M it doesn't say she got took her a bath and right powdered and you know why because eler by then had convinced her of one thing right I come after a bride she said but if I pretty enough how we eat her he said you don't understand you're beautiful to my eyes but I'm sure she was a beautiful woman and he said I chose you did CU he had R he went over there go down there and get me a wife for my kin folks wouldn't that's what his daddy said the boy didn't have anything to do with him father send him down there to eler cuz he knew elzar's nature and ways and things and he knew he wouldn't go down there and get him an ugly he get him a beautiful woman but he wanted beautiful character more than anything in the world she sure didn't smell too good when she watered all of them camels when them things can drink what is it 36 gallons of water it takes to fill up one Cel is a story about that or something this thing's not made on how beautiful we are and how much we smell what kind of Church we've got but we just y'all Lula y'all just don't have a church nice enough nice enough for us we not in debt we don't have to pick our people for the money to get to pay for the things did you understand she didn't put herself up she just jumped off that c when it took off cuz you know why she knew she was already accepted do you understand the laws they had that when eler went out there with the words from Isaac's father that ever who eler brought back would be the wife of Isaac all left up to Al eer I think R Brown done a good job beating us around and scaring us out and washing us getting us ready it's about time to go meet him we're not going up in the a either we're going to meet him out here in the field somewhere not out in the field you know what I'm saying we're going to meet him in this Dimension cuz he's coming here he'll be a little above ground yet and then we'll go up but he's coming here so visible among us until he can raise the dead and then we'll see him in the air and go meet him this is a dimensional change I'll get through that one of these days when not glorified it's just a change just up in the air and we're gone the bride of Christ he knows what his bride is going to look like cuz he saw all of us before the world even the color of our high come on brothers let's stand even the color of our hir are he knows exactly what we're going to look like you know he reads the word too you know that God reads the word you want the Bible for it one day he walked in the temple and picked up a Bible and he sat down to come on right the Book of Luke he read the Bible turned around and said this day this scripture is fulfilled he read his own word I was
