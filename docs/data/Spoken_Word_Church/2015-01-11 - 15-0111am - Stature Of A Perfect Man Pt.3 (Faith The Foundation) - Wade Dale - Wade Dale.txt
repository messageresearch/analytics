========================================
hey man good morning everyone we're going to read from Psalms uh 16 verses 1 through 11. 16. let's pray Heavenly Father wherever gracious Lord and thankful Lord all that you are doing for us Lord ways may seem difficult and hard sometimes but let us believe and know that you're always near God for you have promised that by Your Word Lord we already healed Lord and we ask that we will just accept the manifestation god of what you have promised Lord what you have given Lord let us never doubt but always believe that you are real in every promise that you made God you'll fulfilled Lord and we thank you for it remember brother Wade this morning Father as he prepares the minister to us remember those that in the Sunday School classes regard that they will be accept your word Lord and have a foundation Lord for that understanding God we thank you in Jesus Christ and we pray amen psalm 16. preserve Me O God for indeed do I put my trust but to the saints that are in the Earth and to the Excellency in whom is all my delight another God their drink offers the Lord is the potion of my inheritance and of my cup thou manifested maintain this my life I Will Bless The Lord who has given me counsel my rims also instruct me in the night seasons I have said the lord always before me because therefore my heart is glad and my glory rejoices My Flesh also shall Rest In Hope thou will show me the path of life in thy presence is fullness of joy at the right hand there are pledges forevermore amen God bless us receive it say it again foreign good to see everybody in the house of the Lord we're glad to have Mary Beth with us say to her welcome she's been here before so she's not a visitor she's been with us before and we pray that the Lord would bless her and take care of her everything you know that have brother Tim Calhoun he's somewhere I guess back in the back or something we're glad to have him with us and we just pray the Lord would bless him take care of him he's going to be traveling on I think after the service home and also pray the Lord are blessed brother Gary said for me to specially say thanks to everybody Brother Gary Atkins for your prayers your concern your calls your your cards and the things you sent to him and he said I don't want to be to the bases that I can't come to church but said I don't want no bugs and things right now you know he's on the mend he's coming upward and it's like I told him one day there I said Brother Gary this is going to be one day at a time time well one of these days you know we'll see one day at a time means you just keep moving on you know you keep moving on and it'll gradually climb higher and higher and he's doing a whole lot better you can understand his wording yesterday he could talk good and things so just be pray that brother howl is real sick remember him just Lord be with him and sister Johnny she got to go home Friday I guess and she's doing better they have found two aneurysms and that said one of them was small and one of them was fairly large but remember that because they were thinking about doing a whole bunch of things and the word got out they were going to do this and that but they're not doing it they're going to let her as far as I know go herself to a you know a head doctor to um be checked out more and more and get everything in order all right brother Doherty he's not got the flu we all thought he had that but he got upper respiratory problems I talked to him this morning so just remember him in your prayers you know in this this and there's many many other sicknesses Among Us but yet we know who the healer is amen we know who's already taken care of it we may have to wait sometimes you know that's our part where our thoughts we think well I prayed why not why am I not better I was listening I think it was last night it might be in the Statue of a perfect man not for like and wrote around and said that's where he wants that you need patience you know when you've asked God he don't come on the scene immediately you need patience to wait upon him to bring it to pass all right and he'll do that all right man that's all right so let's sit and remember brother Louise he is down in Costa Rica but he's been having problems with his stroke he went there as an interpreter and I guess they're having to get somebody else or helping him one but he's sick so remember him and pray that the Lord would be with him he's got I guess another week or so and then he'll be heading back home so remember that all right remember all of the people around the world in the message of the hour that we pray that the Lord would bless and we don't have to ask him to because he promised him amen until we believe it all right let's just sing as Wade I think that's all the announcements oh no fellowship meeting this coming Saturday at brother Longoria's in Alabama now if you want to go don't let me know Saturday at 10 30. okay you will drive that's as good as I can say it we try to help and haul you and do everything else but we need to know ahead of time or we can make schedules and do things all right but we'll be leaving Wade's house probably about 10 30. make sure you're there back in 30. the word that we can get over to Alabama for the fellowship meeting all right any other announcements hi Jim see let me missed something but we're glad to have brother Tim Willis appreciate him he was good this morning he came in and I couldn't get the sound system I knew the mechanisms and checking everything I knew but I said well we need somebody and he walked in and all he had to do is walk up and push two buttons well I remember my brother-in-law one time he called an electrician over to his house and he asked him to come and help him an electrician came and all he done was took the thing out turned it over put it back in and it started working and my brother-in-law said well how much do I owe you and back then it was big money you know he said like twenty dollars he looked at him you know he said it's not what you do it's what you know that's pretty good so brother Tim I said it's got something to do with them two boxes he just pushed buttons you know but we're glad to have him all right let's just saying Open the Eyes of My Heart as Wade comes to minister unto us they're going to be trying to do some PowerPoints today and things to try to help you and help us all to understand I hope you're listening to we've already listened to Statue of perfect man twice this week I hope you'll listen to it Blasphemous names um my God hope you listen to them because it will help you to understand and if you listen for this coming Wednesday on the message called questions and answers on Genesis I think it's 53 but questions and answers on Genesis it'll help you to follow what we're trying to say on the point we're getting across okay Open the Eyes of My Heart Lord put me out of my heart see Open the Eyes of My Heart Lord amen Open the Eyes of My Heart I won't receive disease I want to see it and how do you want to see shining in the light of your glory pour out your power and love as we sing foreign you are yes you know when I think as long you think of all the Angels saying holy holy holy well you know when the bride sings it they have to shut up when we say if they have to be quiet because they don't know him as that Holy that we know him they know him as a holy God he created them for worship but he created us to be Sons and Daughters of the Living God to come straight from the source good to be in the house of the Lord good to have each and every one one of you with us today they have brother Tim Calhoun up here with us and good to see Mary Beth again as usual I told her when she came in I said you know your way around I said I ain't got to lead you nowhere you've been here before so don't have to uh don't have to lead the people that's been here they know what's going on so Lord bless each and every one of you uh by way of announcements brother Dale's already said but remember the fellowship meeting at my will leave my house about 10 30. and uh some of you want to go you can stay over at the house if you need to some of you and uh and all that also remember I know brother Dale said Luis was sick but Sister Christine said he's really sick uh really sick can't sleep at night a lot of congestion off he's running a fever or not but he's sick so he's had to stop interpreting a couple of times and and let somebody finish or for him to just take a little rest so it's one thing to be sick it's another thing to be sick in another country right he's in Nicaragua and I I you know that's a long way from home you can't drive from there to hear I don't think so uh just keep him in your prayers because uh like I said he's over there doing a job he's over there doing a job for the Lord and we should all bind together and pray for that man that that the Lord will touch him now not later now he needs to be touched now so we'll just keep him in your prayers and I uh um pray that he will that he will get the message that we are Binding Together to pray with him I also remember let's see what else I got here trying to get the list finished I think what we'll do today he just depressed on my heart this morning that um as we're speaking today we have our prayer cloths up here and we have some prayer napkins that were that we're going to preach over or pray over but for all this sickness that's going on I think we ought to all take an anointing cloth home with us put it over your door you say oh that's going I really don't care what you think right anointing oil the Bible says anoint with oil pray for the sick it doesn't take that out never has and never will until we get all perfected it's still going to be that we need a prayer cloth sure we got prayer cloths in our pocket for ourself but let's take one home with us today take that thing and tape it up over the doorpost of your home it doesn't matter if you get a bug out there when you walk under that thing may God's anointing oil just wipe that thing right off of you all right so I think we need to do that kind of kind of break it up anyway it's not going to hurt it's not going to hurt so we still believe in that amen amen we believe in praying for the sick hey man also remember me going to the Philippines February 25th just remember that keep me in your prayer and I want to thank brother Joan Brother Anderson Bob Richard all the ones and brother banning all the young men that run the sound system and do all this that we're going to see today you know they spend time you know we sometimes it takes a long time for uh for them to do things and I'm not that up on computers to be able to do what they did today but Brother Anderson did it pretty quick and and brother Joe and then put all it together and brother Benny just Those Behind the Scenes you never see right I just want to give them uh give them a hand clap of Praise that uh that sometimes like sometimes when we're you know doing things not of the world but when we're out working or or doing something just remember them because they may be sitting at home on a computer trying to fix something for a dummy like me so I can present it to y'all you know so just keep them in your prayers and and uh and say a special prayer for them one day so let's turn to Second Peter one verse 1. we're on the Statue of a perfect man I hope all of you that didn't hear last Sunday I hope you heard it or watched it of the introduction of the Statue of a perfect man because that's all we stayed on today we're going to start on faith the foundation all right and that's the foundation and we're going to stay on the foundation for a little while because you really got to get that Foundation level square and straight and it must be solid so we're going to uh spend today all day on it today in in this afternoon on the foundation so let's bow our heads and go to the Lord in prayer the only father we pray today Lord that you will not be a bystander in this church Lord be an active participant be the one that does the speaking does the hearing does the all the presentation all the thoughts and ideas of our mind be centered on you father may you be the one that has the preeminence Lord just take care of each one be the ones that are sick the ones that are not here today Lord we pray that you would anoint them now Lord we pray for brother Louise over there doing your work Lord we pray that you touch him right now father and just raise that body up for your honor and Glory father and and take care of that old bug that's in his body that's bothering him Lord and he can continue his work father we pray that you bless the ones that are not here today also the same thing Lord go to them and raise them up Lord as they hear the word may it heal them Father just be with each one forgive us of our sins many mistakes that we make Lord against you and bless the missionaries on the Foreign Fields Lord give them fruit for their labor father just bless this day take care of us lead us and guide us by your Holy Spirit in Jesus name amen second Peter 1. Simon Peter a servant an apostle of Jesus Christ to who to them that's us that have obtained the light precious Faith with us through the righteousness of God and our Savior Jesus Christ Grace and peace look at what look at all these things that if we if we stay in this statue of a perfect man look Grace and peace boy don't we need Grace and peace amen amen in all of our Lives we need Grace and peace be multiplied not just give to you but multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God in Jesus our lord according as his there's that word divine there's only one divine and that's the almighty he's the only Divine One Satan's not Divine so we're not talking about him this morning amen according as his divine power hath given unto who us all things that pertain unto what life and godliness so that's what we're going to be speaking on through this whole statue of a perfect man is how to conduct yourself in your life and that godliness that applies to your life Glory because you know the way you're going to show God is through your what Your Life okay all right through the knowledge of him that has called us to glory and virtue whereby our given so there's things that are given unto us and they're not just giving they're given to us exceeding right exceeding great and precious promises that by these you might be partakers of the divine nature the food may be good but you got to eat it having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust and then what we're speaking on last week and besides this right all right what we're going to be talking about today is the besides this man okay verse 1 through verse 5 or 4 is talking about the new birth right amen there's only one divine nature and that's the new birth of God that's God's nature okay and if you don't have it you're not born again if you have it then you have the divine nature of God Amen all right so we must see then that we truly must be born again I don't care what other Doctrine you've heard in this church we believe you got to be born again before you even get into the pyramid get into the body and that's what the prophet taught man amen so if the prophet taught it and the Bible taught it and we taught it then somewhere in those three we got to be right because there is a perfecting of the Saints as we were talking about the other day and besides this and besides this new birth that I've been talking about Peter says and besides this giving all diligence add to your faith virtue into virtue knowledge and all these Temperance Temperance patience to patience godliness and godliness brotherly kindness and the brotherly kindness charity for if these things be in you and abound amen not just be in you and abound they make you it's going to turn your nature from the old man to the new man it's going to make you yeah that's what he says that you shall neither be Barren nor unfruitful so you're going to bear fruit in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ but he that lacketh these things in other words he that just gets born again and sets down and and becomes a good church member right he didn't lacketh these things is blind and cannot see now what is that word see that doesn't mean that your natural eyesight has been diminished that word see means understanding okay and cannot understand afar off in other words further on the further moment of the Revelation you cannot understand if you don't have these virtues working in your life and have forgotten that he was purged from his old sins wherefore the rather Brethren give diligence look at that word diligence look how many times this deal that's suppressing diligence diligence to make your calling an election sure for if you do these things ye shall never fall amen amen the Lord bless his word and you can be seated ye shall never fall what a what a what a promise amen you shall never fall right you say oh I fall every day well the Bible says if you'll do these things you won't maybe that's our problem we're not doing we know how the virtues work in our life it's because we're so up and down and in and out and all those things right amen amen pretty straightforward sometimes all right let's go to Ephesians 4 and as we were talking kind of background last last Sunday all right we're going to read uh Ephesians 4 in just a second but I tell you what put up the uh put up the picture the first one brother Anderson and let's do that and then we'll work our way down to this because as we were speaking for those of you that weren't here last Sunday um because we skipped that one if you go back to the where it says centerpiece you'll go to the I want you to look at this new isn't that good I told him I said that's a neat little camo pair and we might have to at the market that camouflage pattern now I think it looks good but actually it's Stones that's like a granite rock that Brother Anderson took off the internet so I like that I like that a lot it really showed but see here we come to Peter tells us what we must have amen then Paul in Ephesians 4 is going to tell us how to get it right all right Peter tells us gives us the outline shows us what we need or what's required amen and then Paul in Ephesians 4 is going to tell us how to get it so so someone is telling us we need it and someone is showing us how to get it so God's so gracious he's not going to lay something out there and not give you a way to get to it amen because the most ignorant person the most unlearned person of the Apostles was Peter yet he brought this great statue of a perfect man to the apostles in the beginning and they grew on that even Paul grew on that right all right exactly because it came to Peter but this is the centerpiece as we were talking about just to review a little bit from last Sunday this is the centerpiece of the message all right when you take the table and you got the whole message out here and and it's called the table now you know and on the internet but you've got this table set out but what's the first thing that attracts your attention a beautiful centerpiece right so the centerpiece of this message you cannot as I was telling you last uh last Sunday this is not an elective course to get you into adoption right you know we had elective courses I told them last Sunday that you know you see these football players that graduate with a PhD in Pottery well that's going to help a lot yeah if you want to go in the Pottery business but he took a lot of electives but there were required courses that you had to take even though if you wanted to be a teacher or a doctor you had to start with the required courses you had to take English 101 English 102. English 103 that's when I was going to school they were required for graduation so these virtues are required for your graduation to adoption you're not going to be adopted just because you're sitting here under somebody that preaches adoption it's an individual affair with God right so these virtues are a requirement you can't bypass that and you hear so many people say wow we're in the adoption Age We Are we are in the adoption age but there's got to be people that are adopted to make it the adoption age amen you can't just call it the adoption age and nobody be there right right but there's a foundation that we have to start with we have to start with an introduction we have to start you know Foundation means beginning got to have a sure foundation and that's what we're going to talk about today but remember it all begins with a desire we're going to read that same quote where brother Brown said it's how much Faith you have is how high you can rise exactly not how much Faith the pastor has or how much faith brother Branham had it's how much Faith you got amen and we're going to talk about faith today and we're going to talk about faith maybe and it may be this afternoon that we talk about faith maybe in a little way a way that that I believe the Lord showed me to to help me with faith not just say well we got to have faith so we'll have faith no it's just that's not true um actually you're born faithless if you're born with faith you wouldn't eat it right right right we're all contrary by Nature contrary is not faith that's right okay your all born contrary without the nature of God right okay so maybe we'll get into that this afternoon but you must have a desire to want these because they are there they are given to you at your new birth but you must grow you must grow in Grace and knowledge you must hear the word and let that word bring it alive all right because you get everything you need for your journey it's just you are the one you and I are free moral agents brother Tim till the day we're changed we're a free moral agent right you're going to decide whether you're going to die and go by the grave or whether you're going to stand for the change one of the two right and it's according to your faith all right but faith comes by what not sitting at home right now let's go to Ephesians 4. Paul's going to lay out the whole program how are you going to get these virtues all right Ephesians 4. and he what he gave some apostles some prophets some evangelists some pastors and teachers Right For What for their perfecting of the Saints right amen all right watch the perfecting of the Saints all the way up at the top that's the perfect that's the statue of a perfect man this is not the statue of a perfect man this is the stature of a perfect man we'll show it to you in just a minute but for the perfecting of the Saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the white body that's me and you all right for the edifying of the body of Christ till he give you all that till right you come we all come in the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the son of God unto a white perfect man amen right so God's give us I was telling them before last Sunday just review them for a minute this has to be a not a perfect you won't have a perfect Apostle a perfect Pastor a perfect teacher in their self we're not perfect right but there is a perfect message that must come through those five channels okay all right and if there is a perfect message then they have to bring it to you amen for the perfecting of the Saints till we all come into the unity of faith and of the knowledge not human knowledge the knowledge of the Son of God unto a perfect man right unto the measure all right measure is what development measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ not just part of it all right right that we henceforth be no more children now when we start today or maybe this evening whenever we get to it that Faith starting at Faith that's children amen your child you must learn you must grow up that we henceforth there'll be no more children right toss to and fro and carried about with every wind of Doctrine look at it happening in the end time now yeah by the slight of men so it had to come from men it come from an imperfect Prophet Pastor teacher evangelist and Pastor I mean all the five right because Hey Brother Brown said false teachers bring false verse so they're bringing something yes it's just false right right anointed ones at the end time we're dealing with it now by the slight of men and the cunning and cunning craftiness wherebys they lie and wait to deceive but speak the truth in love may grow up grow up into him in all things which is the head even Christ from whom the whole body fitly joined even in the natural pyramids you can't put a knife blade in between those huge Stones we can't duplicate that even in the end time that it's so so compacted together that you can't put a knife blade between them that's pretty good for all them they said there's several million of them stones in those pyramids to make every one of them fit the right way and it'd be a stone yes yes had to be Almighty help them do that from whom they'll hope but you know what he's requiring that of me and you that Satan can't put a knife blade in between my faith and my virtue of my knowledge your faith your virtual your knowledge Satan can't get a Headway into that amen that's the problem now yeah we got cracks in our walk or in our growth development or in our measurement of of the fullness of Christ For Whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted right man not just put the building in but I mean pack that baby in right by that which every joint supplies according to the effectual working look at these words that are that are that are action words yes they're all action diligent well you see all this and I'm telling you it takes an overcoming amen you got to overcome something to come to church it's easy to sit at home and watch it on the internet I know some people have to but Overcomers come to church and then Overcomers can go to Revelations and see all those eight different overcomings that you get blessed by the reason we're not getting blessed is because we're doing not doing what God Said Amen terrific gotta hear it from the back everywhere that's our problem that's our problem right according to the effectual working and the measure of every part maketh increase of the body that means we all grow together unto the edifying of itself that's right yeah so we edify ourself in love all right one for the other not adding to that but one to the other addict now look remember last Sunday let me just still reviewing there's what Paul is telling you how to get it you got to listen to a perfect word to become perfected you can't be perfected by non-word right all right so you got to have the right kind of word but there is a suffering there is an overcoming that remember we read the quote where brother Brown says power without character is satanic right so we must have we we know we have the power the Holy Ghost is the power amen amen the Holy Ghost is the power we have that power it was released on the day of Pentecost if you want to put an age on the Holy Ghost it's 2 000 years old you understand what I'm saying right right you know I mean it's been here for a while I'm saying it's not something new right brother Brown did not come to bring us the new birth or a different way to get it or God changed his mind from Paul to here right brother Branham came to expound or expand or to what I think he brought to fitly join together and compact the word that was already here right he didn't come to bring us a new word he took that word that we had man man had eat that thing to where it wasn't of any effect that's right the faith of the people had been deteriorated against the word of God the Catholic Church says no you don't need to read it we'll tell you what it says yeah right well see that's where it started and then it becomes the denominations where you got Baptist Methodist Pentecostal whatever the brown of mites that have eroded the word so much that God can't work he can't work in non-word all right though it may be the letter of the word remember though it be the letter of the word right but it takes the power and the character amen amen we have the power now it takes the character of God to bring that power to the right position because power without character is satanic right right power without character what happened to Judas Judas had the power he preached they cast out Devils they healed the sick Jesus told him you have the power go go preach the gospel but Judas didn't have the character of God right we know he didn't have the new birth in his soul because none of them had a new birth until Jesus died and come back on the day of Pentecost we know that but Judas was so close he had the power of God but his power and his character wasn't together so so that made him satanic that made him what he was so that's the same thing with you and I so we need we have to suffer to reign we must overcome remember it's not what you overcome it's how you overcome it all right then we must have the power and the character to go along with it right to bring us up to the Statue of a fullness of Christ now also here we'll keep going remember we read the scripture there in Galatians where that the law was a Schoolmaster right right to bring us to Christ it didn't put us in Christ it brought us to Christ it puts you it puts you in a way to where that you realize you were lost you have to realize you were lost before you can be saved hey man so the the law brought you the do's and don'ts of the law brought you the school Master remember the school Master School master was not necessarily the teacher the school master was the principal right right when we were growing up we had principles but back on further later you know back into 15 1600s they had they had school Masters or they called them School arms and when you got in trouble that's where you went because she knew all the do's and don'ts the teacher was the one that was teaching you the ABCs in the one two threes the school Masters the one that kept you straight all right so that's what the law is the law is the school Master to bring you to Christ right all right but then Paul keeps going on Galatians 4 where he says but you're not under Schoolmaster anymore because when you get into Christ the school Master comes in you right right it's still do's and don'ts but it's a love of doing and don't and it's not a well I well you know I I cut my hair but they they say something about it no it's like June's always said and I use this as an example and Jim said if God himself can come down suffer what he suffered die on a cross give his life for me my little bit of Glory back to him if he says don't cut your hair I'm not going to cut my hair right amen you know what God Honors that you know what the Bible says about about cutting hair okay you can read it still the word of God I don't care where you go amen all right where was I School Master then you are now under tutors and governors the holy ghost is now the tutor or the teacher and the governor of your life should be once you get born again it's it's not do's and don'ts we're going to read a scripture in a minute where or maybe later on where Paul says leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ now look let me explain that real quick for those of you that may not come back this afternoon that gets all over today and don't need the rest of the rest of the service I don't understand you're not doing what the Bible says but uh see there we go you think well I'm sick well okay but anyway if you take and if I leave Gillsville Georgia and I'm going to see brother Tim in Manchester Tennessee I'm leaving Gillsville to go to Manchester Tennessee amen but I'm not doing away with Gillsville as I leave right so see Paul's not saying leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ in other words let's don't do them things anymore no do's and don'ts and water baptism and all that no he's saying we're going to leave that and we're going to continue on to Manchester Tennessee gillesville Georgia's still there but I'm leaving that and I'm going to Manchester I'm leaving the principles of what my Foundation is and I'm going to carry on to another level I'm not doing away with this because that's our foundation that's what we're talking about today okay now bring the picture up we read the scripture of course how that that Jesus was what he had a uh he was the headstone next next picture bear with him for a minute see there's your picture now what happened was remember the Bible says The Headstone was rejected right so that's the way it looks now amen if you're growing if you're starting your growth okay because the headstone was rejected wasn't put on the pier the actual pyramid saw The Headstone which is Christ all right the son of man he had to go away he was rejected amen they rejected the son of man okay they rejected the son of man now we know the Son of God was in the son of man but just to keep it simple they rejected The Headstone well they done away with him right had their own Creeds their own ideas and whatever but what he did was he didn't disappear brother Tim and go away he comes right back down the corner of the scripture and becomes what bring it up head of the corner right he comes right down here and starts building that building again right right amen he comes right here that's just a little pyramid each one of those squares or each one of those uh Corners is a little pyramid in itself and what he's going to do he's going to come right down here and he's going to build you back up he doesn't need building back up that's right man you can't tear down Jesus Christ but you can tear down the effects of what he said and that's what the world's been doing for all these years but right here he comes right back down here with the love of God on the cornerstone and becomes the head of the corner what to bring us back up to adoption yeah to the son of man Revelation in the end time this was the son of God through seven Church ages right the Holy Ghost all right got that but remember the Son of God is Not does not get adopted right son of God's the Holy Ghost he is the adopter yes hey man he's the he's the one that does the adopting amen but the son of man is the only one that can reach adoption so down through the down through the seven Church ages man done away with him but God started right back here on the day of Pentecost started building a foundation from the Cornerstone right right building it up to back up to where man can be adopted that's why in the end time the only way the son of man could come back was the Gospel of the son of man had to be preached amen with no listen to me with no error did Jesus have error when he was standing here on Earth foreign if you say if you say the son of man Ministry is back on the earth there's no error to that ministry right exactly right because you can't get you can't be adopted he would have not took Jesus up there on the mountain and adopted him if there was some error there somewhere right so you say well you got your ideas and I've got my ideas and I've heard this brother's got his ideas there's only one truth amen there's only one truth it's like brother Trevor told that guy the other day on that video that he was doing with uh there were some brothers come from Africa to the Tabernacle giving out trash did anybody see that giving out tracks promoting polygamy through the prophet's message yeah and brother Trevor said brother you know what he said I'm not going to argue with you he said either you're wrong and I'm right or I'm wrong and you're right but we both can't be right right that's right when it comes to God you both can't have the different opinion and be right it's got to be one Faith one Lord and one baptism right if I would have been up there I said look brother you can have all the wives you want front but you ain't in the message right you have all wives you want go back to Africa and have all the women you want I said you just got a lust Spirit on you that's all right and if you can handle four or five different wives you a better man than I am and the men say Amen the truth anyhow that is the truth right okay then if they can have them they can have all they want but they're not in the Bible they're not in the prophet's message that's for sure but you know what the brother took the book marriage and divorce and kept pointing the prophet said the prophet said the prophet said he was saying it right out of what this message is he wasn't taking no other book he took that marriage and divorce book and was proven polygamy to all those people up there so don't tell me that the letter of the words got any power the letter of the word has no power right man this power behind the letter amen the power behind the letter and that's what we're talking about here we can we can say all we need these we need these that's what we've been saying for 50 years yeah we need days we need days now we must have them and there is a way to get to them if you'll just listen all right so now we're going to start with a foundation we're going to start with a foundation if you'll take all those away and put us down to one we're going to talk about faith today all right we have to have a starting point amen and it's called faith all right can everybody see that can you raise that up a little bit I think the ones in the back can't see it if not that's okay can everybody see that Richard can you see it okay all right if you can see it on the back row we're fine so let's go to Hebrews 5 . now remember the remember the parable of a man building his house and on Sand and then one building on the Rock we all know that okay a rock is what a revelation Iraq is a firm foundation all right so now in Hebrews 5 verse 8 all right everybody got it okay they got it though he were a son now this is Jesus though he were a son yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered that's right and being made perfect he became the author of Eternal salvation to all them that obey him called of God and high priest after the order of Melchizedek of whom we have many things to say and hard to be uttered seeing ye are dull of hearing right right this is Paul but he's talking to us for when for the time you ought to be teachers right you have need that one teach you again which be the first principles of the Oracles of God and our become such as have need of milk and not of strong meat for everyone that uses milk is unskillful in the word of righteousness for he is a babe now he's not saying you don't need to be a babe he's saying you're staying a babe yeah right all right but strong meat belongs to them that are of full age even those who by reason of use exercise right even those who will by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil right that means we must study that's what I said it's going to take you steady it's going to take a desire for you to say God I need these virtues and I want these virtues all right if you don't then I we can't help you all right all right let's go to Hebrews 6. let's read a few scriptures and see we're going to continue that was one through three and this is what we do look therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ now there's only one it doesn't say doctrines this doctrine of Christ let us go on to Perfection not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works and a faith toward God so we're not gonna We're not gonna start with faith and then we're going to start building another little uh you know you're you're not going to build your own Foundation over here on the side it's not you has nothing to do with you it's God all right not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works and the faith toward god of the doctrine of baptism and of laying on of hands and of resurrection of the dead and of Eternal judgment and this will we do if God permits right well God has permitted for it to be done so don't worry about it it is being done all right let's go to First Corinthians three verse 9 . I like this scripture here for we are laborers together with God with God ye are God's husbandry you're God's Building according to the grace of God which is given unto me as a wise master builder now who is this Paul Paul's age was that first church age right then there was his faith all right that was the foundation of all Christianity came from Paul Peter James John the 12 apostles all right because we're going to read here in just a minute that's what it was built on as a wise master builder I have laid the foundation and another buildeth their own upon you he's going to lay the foundation but he knew he wasn't the only one to come right right and another another buildeth thereon but let every man take heed how he buildeth thereupon right okay take heed it's got to be built right it can't be built amen according to somebody else's Foundation Paul laid the foundation brother Brown says many times Paul Paul Paul Paul Paul he knew if he preached what Paul preached that he was on the right road because Paul preached his straight the first time all right for other Foundation can no man lay that is laid for a other Foundation can no man lay that is laid which is Jesus Christ so he's the foundation of it all all right we know that now if any man build upon this Foundation gold silver precious stones would have stubble Every Man's work shall be made manifest right amen your Works shows your faith amen all right faithful that works is dead but works is not Faith that's right and it's totality right right because you can work yourself to death and not have no faith at all we'll talk about that maybe a little bit later on this evening all right every man's work shall be made manifest for the day shall declare it see our day is going to declare what we believe that's right amen our day is going to declare what we believe because it shall be revealed by fire and the fire shall try every man's work you're gonna be tried of what short it is Glory if any man's work abide which he hath Bill thereupon he shall receive a reward if any man's work shall be burned he shall suffer loss but he himself shall be saved yet so as by fire exactly amen amen know ye not that you are the temple of God and that the spirit of God dwelleth in you he's asking the question see the question mark Source left up to you to tell Paul or me or brother Dale or whoever the world that you have the spirit of God in you all right if any man defile the temple of God him shall God destroy that's right for the temple of God is Holy which Temple ye are amen amen that's pretty self-explanatory but that's got to be the foundation now go to Ephesians 2 verse 19-22 we read this one last Sunday this is where Christ is the head but he's now become the Chief Cornerstone but watch this now therefore ye Are No More Strangers in follower foreigners but fellow citizens with the Saints you've come into a new family right you're not this is not this is not the family of the world that's right it's just what I was I was studying on yesterday morning this is not this has nothing to do with the world nothing not one thing but Tim out here yeah this all has to do with the world that's right even your justification and sanctification you're still you still have that worldly part right amen you you got a worldly nature until you're born again that's right and you're born again and what faith So you you're not in this body you're not in this Kingdom you're not in this family you're not in this city until you're born again right so there's nothing of the world in this it's not worldly patients we have there's many people in the world that has patience that's not godly patients amen these are all God virtues not man virtue amen all right because we're born contrary to God right now therefore you're No More Strangers than foreigners but fellow citizens with the Saints and of the household of God all right and are built upon the foundation of the Apostles and Prophets Jesus Christ himself being the Chief Cornerstone we showed that a minute ago in whom all the building fitly framed together growth right that's right growth development growth unto an Holy Temple in the Lord in whom ye also are building together for inhabitation of God through the spirit you cannot be a habitation of God until you have the spirit of God in you why is the Bible say the unclean Spirit has to go out of a man the unclean Spirit has to go out of a man because you're born listen we're born wrong we're born with an unclean Spirit let's just agree with that you weren't born no different than than Adolf Hitler right oh I had this seed in me and I had that oh forget it people you were born dead I found a quote the other day where brother Brown said you were born with a sinful soul and how much more can you you're born with a sinful Soul let's just let's just say we were born dead lost exactly out of this Kingdom sure God knew we were coming in God in you God had a word for us he had a seed for us sure but it came to me it wasn't in me if it was in Me God didn't have to die on a cross right he died on a cross to release that life so it could come into me man Lord have mercy Jesus people come on Jesus even breathed on his disciples and said receive ye the Holy Ghost now did they receive the Holy Ghost right then no no now why didn't that seed Quicken right then if it was already in them right the word himself said receive ye the Holy Ghost wasn't a second person that was God Almighty that said it and it didn't Quicken that seed because that seed was laying there it was dead in the word right but when he came back on the day of Pentecost that word came to the people and it quickened what they held on to Lori amen that you know what that makes God I've said it before that makes God adjust God he can't be a just God if he birthed you a different way than he birthed anybody else one more time because if one man can walk up to the day of judgment and say you made waydale different than me now don't tell me because remember the minds of everybody is going to be expounded when we get over there that's right in that theophany everybody's mind is going to be expanded they're going to know that they were a sinner they were lost and on their way to hell right but if they know that hey that guy was born different than me how can God be just right well they were my children well then you then you made me different it made me different all God's going to say is he chose me and you didn't that's the whole That's the basis brother Brown never said anything about free moral agency being done away with free moral agency is the soul of man to choose Faith or doubt you were not born with faith and doubt in your soul you were born with one or the other right not both all right everybody we know that here but there's a lot of people that don't understand that and they think there's some great something but Ephesians 2 in whom all the building fitly framed together groweth unto a holy Temple all right now look Hebrews 11. let's go there right now because we're going to start today on this Foundation called faith got it by faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death and was not found because God had translated him for before his translation not two days before he got her knowledge he walked 500 years with God amen for before his translation he had this testimony that he pleased God but but without faith it is impossible to please him who God impossible to please God you can't even understand Jesus Christ until you get born again all right for he that cometh through God Must Believe believe that he is what that he is God yes you got to believe that that's what I'm saying about this Faith thing this Faith thing is a belief in something right right that he is and he is a rewarder of them that what there's another one of those action words diligently right seek him right Paul like to use that word and so did Peter so we must be diligent about what we're doing all right so let's read one quote and then we'll make some comments here I want to get this get this first quote I want the prophet to tell us now look it's in the Statue of a perfect man number one I read this last Sunday but we're going to read it again this is where we're going to start from try to hold on to uh about another 15 or 20 minutes all right paragraph 100 a man can't understand why people shout man can't understand why human beings language would change in his speaking tongues the natural man can't see how a glory of God would come over a man's eyes and he'd see visions and tell them of certain things and what to do and tell them things that's fixing to happen and fix things to come to pass like the Lord did for us here last night even see see the natural mind tries to figure it out well what did he do or what kind of a hoax is he using what gimmick has he got to see a man speaking in tongues they'd say somebody interpret and tell just exactly to a certain member of the body what they've done and what they should not do see see they think it's some kind of a hoax there's something fixed up between them that's what always they said you know but now look look at paragraph 101 they can't understand it till that man's born again all right so don't try to understand you can't understand God unless you're born again right right then we're going to back up and talk about the new birth and just a little in just a little bit then when he's born again then he's in line for Fellowship because he's a new creation that old suspicious doubting character he was is dead now he's a new creation so you see he don't have to add anything to his now because it'll automatically be added all right notice you must be born again I don't know where people under try to see that you got to get all these virtues before you get the Holy Spirit we'll discuss that Holy Spirit right there it is a different anointing than when you were born again absolutely but it's not you got to wait that far to get the new birth that's totally incorrect that there's no truth to that at all you can't put it in the Bible or the prophet's message because we just told you there Peter Peter said you got to have the divine nature of God and besides this add to your born-again experience virtue all right notice you must you must be born again and when you're born again you can't be born again without having faith that's right so you see on my chart here I got the very Foundation faith is the foundation of all of it so see though we may leave that Foundation of Faith you never quit believing it's always there right for without faith it's what impossible to please God now he's quoting scripture here he that cometh to God must believe that he is in a rewarder of those that diligently seek him see he must be and when you're a skeptic of the Bible don't you remember when you were skeptic of the Bible whether you ever read it or not if you didn't read it you sure didn't believe it was even in existence right right so you're an unbeliever but when you're skeptic of the Bible when you're skeptic of the word being right you just might as well stay back until first you believe it all right see there's there's the first principles of the Oracles of God the water baptism the name of the Lord Jesus Christ the things that we learn you know the dress the hair and all that that's the that's that'll that'll that'll come that'll come may not be instantly but it'll it's got to come because it's contrary to the Bible if you don't do these things that the Bible says or you do things that the Bible says not to do all right that's iniquity that's right right when you're skeptic of the word being right you just might as well stay back until first you believe it what he's saying smoking drinking cussing cutting your hair running around with women no the reason you do that is because you're an unbeliever what is sin unbelief there's only two elements now look this is what we read last Sunday but I want you to see it look here brother Tim there's only two elements that controls the human being two so let's break it right down to just two elements that's either doubt or faith right yes one or the other not one and the other right you're possessed of one that dominates your life just depends on how much Faith you have how high you can rise depends on how much Faith you have right is how high you can rise but first it's got to be Faith let me stay on that foundation for a while now Faith Is What You Must Believe faith is what faith is the substance of things hoped for it's you already have it when you have faith because it's revealed in faith all right faith is the substance of things hoped for Hebrews 11 saying we'll cover that maybe this afternoon what is it what kind of an Evidence a holy evidence so it takes you right to that evidence the evidence is the holy evidence all right it's a holy evidence I like that quote I wish you I think I'm going to take that and put it up on my on my refrigerator Jim how high you can rise it's your job right right right but now look you got to get to where you can hear you got to get where you can hear because remember faith comes by hearing remember it comes by preaching of the word of God so you got to put yourself in these in these things is how high you can rise because you know what it's like I was telling them brother Tim brother Tim's a master electrician right brother Tim I mean he works on huge like big complexes I'm scared to take that see you laugh and that's okay you laugh because it does it scares me if I was to take him screws off of that uh plate right there scare me to death that I'm going to get electrocuted why because I don't have faith in myself because I don't understand right electricity but I know what he'll do to me if I put my finger in there but see brother Tim he's like well geez that's like a piece of candy I'll just take over here and move this I'm gonna move this over here and I'll move this over here don't turn the electricity off I can handle it don't turn it and he fix it puts it back why he's got faith in what he can do right because he's been taught he took the required courses in class right that's right he took the rig he took the required you know what I bet you he didn't sit at home and they had class and he said well I don't need it right that's right that's a good way to get killed yes it is right you fooled with electricity he foods with it's vaporization it ain't just burn it's like you're there a minute and then you're not there's only left is your shoes that's what brother Keith 3 said he sell that several times when he was in Jamaica he works on those great big complexes he saw a guy open a a thing up one time and it and it arced yes he stepped into it the guy opened the big panel up and he stepped into it and it it flash art and he said there was nothing left of the man but shoes he was gone but you know what it's because the man made a mistake he didn't have enough knowledge of what he was doing that's the same way with the word of God you must be skillful in the knowledge of the word how can you use a sword without having one first and then without trying to take and and practice and practice and practice that's what brother tell me practiced and he practiced he'd done the right things well obviously he ain't made a mistake in electrical part he's still sitting here okay so you know that's the same way with you and I we haven't made a mistake if we're sitting in church and we're listening to the word of God if we're doing the things of God well we're not making that kind of a mistake but that that's our problem because it's life and godliness that we're talking about it's it's our everyday life but brother Tim he is he's got the knowledge so therefore that doesn't scare him well that's the same way with the word of God the reason we're scared of the word of God are that we don't have faith it's because we don't believe the word of God's what it is that's just that's just basic ground level you know you say well well I just don't see it that means you don't understand it right okay you must understand God you must believe that he is at a rewarder of him that diligently seek you just as the scripture said But first you got to have faith now Faith Is What You Must Believe amen faith is what substance of things hoped for it's you already have it when you have faith because it's revealed in faith faith is the substance of things hoped for Hebrews 11. see the evidence what is it what kind of an Evidence a holy evidence right all right but it's got to be Faith now let's go to Romans 10 and then we'll stop right here for a minute and uh and pull our chart up and we'll start maybe do a little bit with justification all right Romans 10 everybody all right well everybody getting kind of where we're going here because we've got to have a foundation you got to be born again how then shall they call on him and whom they have not believed and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard right and how shall they hear about this person that they have not believed in without a preacher am I adding to the word I'm telling you what he's saying like Paul I'm interpolating a little bit in there because that's what he said and how shall they hear without a preacher hear what hear who they're believing in right right because you got to believe in something you haven't seen anybody seen Jesus down cross no only a movie right right it's hearsay but I believe that he did because the faith in me believes that he did exactly and we know absolutely he did and how shall they preach except they be sent it's written how beautiful it'll be to them to preach the gospel of peace bring Glad Tidings of good things but they have not all obeyed the gospel it's awesome yeah Amen to that brother brother Ray Brazil says Lord who hath believed our report right I want to ask you one time one thing who has believed your report right right who has believed your report is your report in the world that God that they can look at you because remember I like what brother Williams said he said I don't want to be called religious the devil's religious but now the devil can't be a Christian right that's true devil can't be Christ can't be Christ he can't act like Christ now sure he can get close but he can't act just like Christ so I want to be called a Christian because remember the people in Antioch were called Christians because they acted like Christ they looked at the people in Antioch and they some of them that were still alive when Jesus was was alive and on the earth they'd look at him they'd looked at them and they said man they act the same why they were christ-like that's what Christian means so I don't want to be religious I want to be a Christian all right so then Faith now here here's the whole summation here in Romans so then Faith cometh by hearing right and hearing by the word of God Amen all right and like brother William said I like what he said too that the word that's the highest Apex of God right amen amen Heaven and Earth will pass away but my word will not pass away amen it's what God Said and you know what he can't change his mind right amen it's forever written this Bible is the true word of God the prophet of God didn't come and bring us a new Bible this Bible was revealed amen by The Prophet's message absolutely but you know what brother Brown even said he said if you leave if you leave that land on the page it can be doubted but when that ever comes in here if that ever comes in here even Satan can't doubt it he's got to know that if that's in here and he's not oh he's religious but he's not a Christian amen can't be one never can be a Christian never will be a Christian right but he definitely was the most first religious person in the world right I mean God was God but but Satan was religious all right so just speak I'm sorry yeah everybody's really you're right about that everybody's religious especially the people get in trouble and they find Jesus in jail you know they get religious when they go before the judge you know they when they got caught they had hair down to hair and Tattoos up to here but when they go meet the judge they got a long-sleeve shirt on and of course a lawyer tells him to do this puts a long sleeve shirt on to hide the tattoos and gets his hair cut first thing why he's presenting himself in front of a judge that's right does that sound familiar he's presenting himself before the judge but you know what he just cleaned the outside up right that's right he didn't clean the inside guy up when we present ourselves before the judge God he looks down in here first right and then sees what it works out to the outside so now Faith is what faith is the divine nature of God Amen the beginning of your Christian experience has to start with faith glory amen you have to start and it's a process it's not God just dumping something on you he knows that you can't handle it he knows he knows you can't handle just God just stay on here here it is because as a baby you can choke a baby with what with meat you choke a baby but now hold on a minute the baby can still eat ing right but as he grows he gets more teeth so we can't eat he gets to where he can digest it well God's God's not like us he don't try to rush you into anything like we want to try you know we want our kids to be sports stars when they're three but God knows God knows that we got to grow you know he knows that we we've got to have a baby form Faith there in Romans 8 it says it says we receive the spirit of a spirit of adoption whereby we cry Daddy Daddy all right we don't receive adoption for a morning and receive the spirit of adoption where you're in line for adoption you got to come from the school Master to the Tudor and then that tutor is brother random says many times that Tudor goes to the father and says he's just like you or he goes to the father and says he's being disobedient the prodigal son was a son yes right okay he just backslid for a little while amen but so here's the process that we must go through bring up the the one you had up a minute ago with faith the foundation and justification and sanctification we're going to talk a little bit this morning about the new birth and the new birth you know as well as I do is one of the most ill-taught subjects brother Branham said it was Ill taught 50 years ago and I say it still he'll talk now okay because remember we got to come to a place that if we're born again and we look into the word of God and we're doing something contrary to what that word says we must repent or either you're not born again or not yet okay one of the two all right one other two and I know there's things that we do that and I'm going to try to explain some of this as we go we may just get into justification for about a few minutes here but we must start see look this does not put you in the body just because you're Justified right are Sanctified right still have spirits to deal with right still got them to deal with here but they're on the outside not the inside right right amen all right these are justification is a work of the Holy Spirit sanctification is a work of the Holy Spirit and like brother Brown said it's not three different uh new births it's one new birth with three processes so you go through a process and I believe you can understand the new birth a lot better if you go through those three processes because everybody has to go through them amen everybody has to go through them all right so you're not exempt then what you have to do is we have to let the prophet of God break those down for us because he said no Baptist I can't go with you on just coming up and shaking hands and turning around and presenting them as you know as a new member no that don't drive nothing out right okay and the Baptist is very wrong when it's they say once saved always saved if you act like you did before right yeah it's like a guy said one time he said you know what to be saved is you was in the water drowning somebody picked you up and put you in the boat they didn't look down and say you're saved you're still drowning that's what the Baptist is says now you just believe well the guy that swimming is going I believe I'm going to die if you don't get me up out of this water but being saved is is you've been taken from what problem you were in situation and put in another one right okay so because remember justification is what not 360 that puts you back in the same direction I've heard some people say you got to do a 360. no 360 you just turned you right back in the same place you're going you got to do a 180 right walk away from what you were doing right yeah so faith is what we were what we were showing there it's a process three stages of the same Grace that puts you into the body all right now for a moment we can bring Genesis 1 in here Genesis 1 26 is right here not here because you're not in the body until you get right here right okay you're not your your foundation is Faith I have to believe that I'm part of that Genesis 1 26 family but now what I have to do though is Brother Richard I have to turn around and prove that by the way I live right I have to turn around and prove that by the way I live right yeah all right I can't keep saying I do this and that and the other and then I'm in the family of God no the characteristics of God your walk your talk and everything has got to be different okay different okay right because justification we're going to read what the prophet said here even in the Statue of a perfect man he proves that you got to go through these three stages of grace before you get the virtues so before we get the verses of God we got to understand that either we are born again and we can start on our journey or we're not born again and we just had an experience right now amen we're not born again we just had an experience and there's no way you can do that without having the new birth there's no way you can can grow in virtue in all those temperatures without having that Foundation but you know what it's got to start with believing yeah faith is believing believing what the word right right I want some man talk the word you got to believe in the word of God all right and that's why we had to have a prophet because some of those teachers taught us things that weren't right yeah father son Holy Ghost and all the Trinity and all that stuff and you know it's okay to do this and it's okay to do that no it's not the prophet of God brought all that together didn't bring us a new new birth right right amen he brought the same New Birth that they had on the day of Pentecost if not it was a false prophet exactly right amen he brought the same New Birth not just believe you're in the message the devil believes is in the message actually the devil is in the message he got here to church before some of you late people did yeah see that's where you got to go back to you say well I have them have a problem brother Graham should be here 20 minutes for service pray read your Bible and study then you come to service right time church starts and you go I didn't get anything yeah you didn't you didn't get nothing because you didn't do what you're supposed to do right right see that goes back to believing you don't believe what the prophet said see watch all these things you become an unbeliever if you keep you keep putting it down you show that yourself you're an unbeliever but doing not doing what he said all right so now number two let's go to number two and we'll come back to that but everybody see this doesn't put you in the body this doesn't put you in the body this does but you got to start with faith to believe you're Justified you got to start with faith to believe you're Sanctified so brother Brown's absolutely true when he says You must start with faith I believe I don't I didn't believe I believe I believe that God took the sins that I did and did away with them now the devil's going to remind you of them you may drive by the place that you did descending you may sometimes look at the place you did descending yeah but God can't remember them I have to believe that the sins that I had before I asked him to save me are gone and people they'll haunt you till the day if you don't say if you don't say God you promised you promised you'd do away with my sins if I if I ask you to forgive me and you got to believe that he did it because remember we got to stand sinless before him the only way wingstand sinless before him is to know that we put them all in the sea of his forgetfulness that's right never the Bible says to be remembered again but now look in justification though you're going to keep doing it because the unclean spirit that made you do it that's why you got to keep getting forgiveness that's right that's right that's right justification that unclean spirit's still there if you were drinking and you're still drinking you're just Justified right smoking and still smoking you will justify it you cannot be Sanctified I'm telling you by the word of God the prophet's message you cannot be Sanctified we'll talk about that this afternoon you can't be Sanctified and be cussing smoking drinking running around with women living in morally there's no way so just say look hey if I'm still doing it thank God you forgive me of my past sins that's right that's right right bro Tim you got to come to that and nail that thing down and say God I know you forgive me for that now let's work on the thing that I got to get rid of to not do that again that's just the way it is because remember the unclean Spirit goes out at sanctification the unclean spirit that made you do those things yes yes it's got to go out of you but you got to fill it with something right amen or that puppy will come right back and he'll bring some good religious and Devils with him this time and he'll put you in church and you'll still do the things out there that's what's wrong with the church in the eye Metro churches of the hour there's too much of that junk still going on secret centers all right let's read number two and then we'll I feel we need to stop here and then we'll uh this afternoon we'll we'll start on justification start on and sanification of baptismal Holy Ghost but you must be born again look this is this is another quote paragraph 131 from statue of perfect man first you must be born again then when you're born again you have faith you believe the word until you're born again you'll argue against it if you're just religiously inclined right and you got a A little human knowledge that you should do right you'll never be able to agree upon the word of God you'll never do it you got to be born again and born again it produces all right then after that's right here f-a-i-t-h she's pointing to us his chart then you're just in position of growing right right now a lot of people go up to the Altar and pray and say Lord forgive me and a great experience of sanctification comes upon them and things and you have a great time get up to the altar shouting you go back say bless God I got it no you just started to a place where you can grow right you ain't done nothing yet see the only thing you've done is just laid the foundation right now you're going to build a house and you pour the foundation say boy I got her see you got the foundation to build your house on yeah now you got to build the house right right okay now there's where the thing comes in this morning we're going to talk about now all right a house this Foundation is first what is the foundation of Christianity right so if you're a Christian here's your foundation right faith in the word of God Amen that's your foundation then you begin to grow okay so you can't grow without without being born again then you start you begin to add to this Foundation see when you become a new creation or a new creature in Christ you start at Faith that's why I say everybody starts at the same level amen amen amen everybody starts at the same level God's not a respecter of persons he starts it's the same same level so now let me read this one more quote because brother Brown in church order 1958 he explains a little bit about justification sanctification then what we'll do is this afternoon we'll back up and speak on it watch this we believe in justification by faith Romans 5 1. we believe that after a person being justified by faith he has peace with the Lord Jesus Christ okay see that's that's what we got to understand too see it if you're truly Justified you are to glorified we know that we'll talk about that maybe later on but in in baby form justifications the way I like to call it baby form justification if you're if God forgives you your sins and you get killed tomorrow you're going to heaven everybody okay with that you're going to heaven you you've had your past sins forgiven you're going to heaven because you have been justified by God but now you're not in here you're not in the bride you're going to be given eternal life at the white Throne judgment you're still going to have to prove your words to God amen but now if you get Justified and then two years later you're still Justified you have made the word of God of none effect and you're going to hell right amen that's the way we believe it here we believe that after a person being justified by faith he has peace with the Lord Jesus Christ but it's possible that this same person could have habits such as drinking smoking doing things that he should not do filthy habits of the flesh right okay got it right but you but from here back you've been forgiven yeah all right but you still got those habits right we'll get into that a little bit more this afternoon then then we believe that the blood of Jesus Christ sanctifies this person for the service of the Lord and that's we believe in sanctification according to Hebrews 13 12 and 13 where Jesus said that he might sanctify the people with his own blood suffered without the gate and we believe that sanctification is taught in the New Testament and meant for the Believers through the New Testament age which we're now living and we also believe that after that person has been Sanctified unclean habits has gone from that person amen right there's sanctification not because you quit these things you're born again nope sorry it's sanctification he is a Believer on the Lord Jesus Christ and his habits are gone we believe that then he is a candidate for the baptism of the Holy Spirit yes which comes as a filling of the believer then when the Believers just as many times I've taught it like picking up a glass right right picks up a glass God picks up the glass right picks up a glass out of chicken yard now you don't want to drink it right now right no right justification is picking it up God picks it up he picks the glass up he's still dirty but he has a purpose for that glass that glass can be filled with pure water all right ready for use to use it with a purpose and heart right that's what God does to the center he's still filthy then he is cleansed by the blood of Jesus Christ in other words sanctifies the compound word which means clean and set aside for service the Old Testament the altar Sanctified The Vessel and it will set aside for service so what'd he do he takes that glass and he cleans it out right right but still not full of anything it's not being used for the purpose that it was meant to be all right amen we believe that the holy spirit is putting the same vessel in service fill it full of good clean water that the holy spirit is not another step of Grace but more of the same Grace that fills the believer to the extent whether it's signs and wonders such as Apostolic gifts spoken of in First Corinthians 12 manifest himself through this believer when the Holy Spirit comes in to take up the gifts I believe that the scripture teaches that gifts and callings are without repentance that when we are born in this world we are sent here by by one purpose that is of god and that before we are even become adults while we're yet children the gift that we have of God is in us then because remember gifts and callings are without repentance remember Elvis Presley had a gift he had a gift of God that's right brother Brown said he could have had a purpose with God but he sold his soul for a fleet of Cadillacs he made a choice that's right and used that anointing to put people in hell that's right man that's right sorry just the way it is I believe that scripture teaches the gifts and calls are without repentance we were standing here for one purpose that's of God that's before we're even become adults when we're children the gift that we have of God is in us then and only the filling of the Holy Spirit puts those gifts into operation amen but we have them in the beginning such as teachers Apostles prophets Gifts of tongues nine spiritual gifts according to First Corinthians 12. now we believe that these gifts are in operation today as they should be in every local church amen all right so three stages of Grace We're gonna talk about this afternoon justification we're going to break it down you say well that's simple but you know what if you're not born again if you just think you're a Believer I want you to either know you're not or you are or you're not right I wish to God like brother Dale said let's stand I wish to God we did realize we were lost right because some people you look and they've never had an experience they've never been to the altar they've never cried they've never they've never moved maybe you're not born again right maybe you're not born again maybe you know I I pray for God to save my soul all the time right you say well I think I was born again 50 years ago well so do I'm 20 or 15 years ago but the desire in my heart though is that I know I'm not the same place that I was but I'm not in a place I should be right right it's like the uh like the old black sister said you know I'm not what a ought to be but I'm sure definitely not what I used to be all right so we're in a process of believing amen amen you love the Lord what we're saying what is it doing that for me we're living by faith that's what we have to do as a Christian we must live by the faith it's not it's got to be the faith we'll talk about this afternoon there's an anchor somewhere you got to put that anchor down and say I believe if it's the Bible you need to believe in what it all says now what part of it says whatever bit of it says all right now just pieces of it that you like the devil likes pieces of it amen yes he does but he don't like all of it right go ahead if you have a name my sins are gone they're underneath the blood on the cross of calvary this darkness is from God in the sea of dark forgetfulness that's good enough for me praise God my sins are gone yes praise God my sins are gone when Satan comes to take me Christ to make me down I say my sins you should just sanctify our brother raise him up from this in Jesus name my sins are gone they're underneath the blood on the cross of Calvary before you leave everybody up and get one prayer cloth for your home and put it on your door you don't have to put it on every door just put it on the door you go in and out of the most and believe yeah they've been Anointed with oil we gonna believe put it over your door we're gonna do away with only six stuff the characters will give them out to you but get one here if you want one you're dismissed but go with God we'll see you back at two o'clock underneath the blood on the cross
