[0:36] also when we went uh to see brother
[0:39] George Canada he
[0:40] brother Dixon that song upstairs he says
[0:44] that Eliza help is on the way and it
[0:48] says uh
[0:51] Elijah instead of Elijah
[0:57] her last meal was almost over and they
[1:00] said Elijah's on the way and then I was
[1:02] written on my candle too and it said
[1:04] about uh this human not a woman

[6:51] the first 50 consumed by fire
[6:57] and a larger answer has said to the
[7:00] captain of the 50 if B if I be a man of
[7:04] God then let the bar come down from
[7:06] heaven consume thee and that 50 and
[7:09] there came down from Far Far From Heaven
[7:12] and consume him and his 50.
[7:17] okay Second Kings 12 14. the second
[7:21] Judgment of the 50.
[7:24] 12 12 14.
[7:28] and Elijah Ezra said unto them if I'll
[7:33] be a man of God let Fire come down from
[7:35] heaven and consume thee in thy 50 and
[7:38] the fire of God came down from heaven
[7:40] and consumed him and his 50 and he sent
[7:43] again a cup and up
[7:47] 30
[7:49] 50 with his 50 and the third captain of
[7:52] the 50 went up and came and fell and his
[7:55] knees before Elijah and received him and
[7:58] said unto him oh man of God are crazy
[8:01] LED my life and the life of these 50
[8:03] servant be precious in thy sight
[8:08] Beholder came far down from heaven and
[8:11] burned up the two captains of the former
[8:14] 50s
[8:15] with their 50s therefore LED my life not
[8:19] be precious and thy sight
[8:24] okay let's go to the
[8:26] last
[8:27] miracle that Elijah did uh Second Kings
[8:30] 2 8.
[8:35] and Elijah took his men don't Raptor
[8:38] together and smoked the waters and they
[8:40] were divided either
[8:43] and glitter so that the two went over on
[8:46] dry land
[8:59] not Elijah got a double portion
[9:01] President says uh and uh
[9:04] a message Elijah and Elijah who said
[9:07] Elijah when he was here he did great
[9:10] works but Elijah had a double portion of
[9:12] his Spirit Elijah had done eight
[9:15] Miracles and Elijah done 16 Miracles a
[9:18] double portion he said a perfect
[9:21] of a church right
[9:24] and Elijah
[9:25] the prophet he said now a double portion
[9:28] of a larger Spirit came on Elijah and he
[9:32] done toys The Miracles that Elijah did
[9:34] in a double portion of the Holy Spirit
[9:38] now I want you to notice Elijah let a
[9:41] rope is a symbol
[9:43] a road was what he was wrapped in
[9:47] and it was a symbol of the Holy Spirit
[9:51] as he went up he walks and the road fell
[9:53] back from
[9:55] the chair and
[9:58] and Elijah picks up the rope and laid it
[10:00] on his shoulders and went down to the
[10:02] Jordan and started doing miracles
[10:06] now Elijah said I just want I don't want
[10:09] the Holy Spirit he said I want to talk
[10:10] to him
[10:11] right
[10:20] let's go to hell
[10:24] just got a job
[10:29] first Captain George
[10:45] okay
[10:55] now Joe Joe also got a
[10:58] a double portion
[11:01] and there was more underneath Joe first
[11:04] second
[11:06] to
[11:08] get two or three and they were born
[11:10] under him seven sons and three daughters
[11:15] and his substance also was seven
[11:18] thousand sheep and three thousand Tamil
[11:21] there's 500 yolks of toxin and 500 gs's
[11:25] and a very great household so that this
[11:28] man was the greatest of all
[11:30] men on the east now we all know when the
[11:34] Devil comes in and he says when God
[11:37] tells him
[11:38] my servant Bill and uh the devil says
[11:43] so he takes he takes everything away
[11:46] from job
[11:52] 42.
[12:01] 42 12-13

[12:08] drove more than his beginning for he had
[12:11] fourteen thousand sheep double right

[12:18] and a thousand yoga possum double and a

[12:33] daughters how come you only gave him the
[12:35] same
[12:36] seven seven
[12:37] because he had seven and a half left so

[13:05] Second Kings 2 14.
[13:38] people talk
[13:45] let's go to
[13:47] let's let's start at nine
[13:51] chapter two nine and it came to pass
[13:54] when they were gone over the Elijah said
[13:56] unto Elijah that's what I should do for
[13:58] me before I be taken away from thee and
[14:01] Elijah said I pray thee had a double
[14:04] portion of that Spirit be upon me and he
[14:07] said now let's ask a hard thing never
[14:09] let never let us see me when I'm taken
[14:13] from me it shall be so unto thee but if
[14:15] not it shall not be sold and it came to
[14:18] pass they still went on and thought
[14:20] maybe four four there appeared charity
[14:23] of fire and horses are far and imparted
[14:26] then both Cassandra and Elijah went up
[14:30] by a long run into heaven
[14:32] 12 and their larger side and he cried my
[14:35] father my father the Chariots of Israel
[14:38] and the horsemen thereof and he saw him
[14:42] no more and he took hold of his own
[14:44] clothes and rented them in in two pieces
[14:47] he
[14:48] you took up also the mantle of Elijah
[14:51] that fell from him and went back and
[14:53] stood by the bank of the Jordans
[14:58] oh I got a picture of the
[15:01] Road money when the election goes up
[15:08] never just a symbol of the Holy Spirit
[15:11] just like uh Moses had that rock of
[15:14] America
[15:16] and uh
[15:17] you know well
[15:20] a lot of times God tells uh Moses tell
[15:24] Aaron to throw down the rod but you know
[15:26] in
[15:27] so Aaron did a lot of stuff with a rod
[15:30] but you know God told most of you tell
[15:32] him to do this but it turned out water
[15:35] to blood
[15:42] okay let's go to
[15:46] chapter 214.
[15:49] and he the first uh first miracle is uh
[15:54] a Jordan a river opened and he noticed
[15:57] the last miracle the Elijah did is the
[15:59] first miracle that the Elijah does and
[16:02] he took the man Elijah that fell from
[16:04] him and smoked the waters instead where
[16:07] is the Lord God of Elijah and we when he
[16:10] had also has made in the water they
[16:12] parted hither and did her and Elijah
[16:15] went over
[16:19] let's go to Second Kings 2 20.
[16:24] he heals the waters
[16:30] and he said bring me a new cursed cruise
[16:33] and put salt there on and they brought
[16:35] it to him
[16:36] 21 and he went forth onto the spring of
[16:39] the water and cast that assault in there
[16:42] and said thus said the Lord I have
[16:45] healed their
[16:46] feel that this water there shall not be
[16:50] from this anymore dead or the barren
[16:54] land
[16:59] I feel as it contains two
[17:03] let's start at 23.
[17:10] cursing
[17:12] mocks the the person who talked and
[17:15] destroyed
[17:17] and he went up from 23 and he went out
[17:20] from dance onto Bethel and as he was
[17:23] born by the way there came four little
[17:26] children and now the city and Mark came
[17:29] and said unto him go up the ball head
[17:32] pull up the ball head
[17:34] he turned back and looked on them and
[17:36] cursed them in the name of the Lord and

[18:42] sons and shall pour out unto all those
[18:45] vessels
[18:46] set aside that which is full
[18:50] five so she went from him and shut the
[18:52] door up on her and upon her sons who
[18:55] brought the vessels to her and she
[18:57] poured out and he came to class when the
[18:59] vessels were full and she said unto her
