[4:45] the Atlanta Journal papers those of you
[4:47] that went through the couponing
[4:48] flashlight last Sunday you may see last
[4:51] Sunday and just remember to get in touch
[4:53] with him because we're going to start
[4:55] doing it on a monthly basis
[4:57] we're going to start paying him up front
[4:59] that way he can get his money
[5:01] you shouldn't have that in your
[5:03] emergency fine
[5:05] or your coupon fund one but just
[5:08] remember to see brother Benny when you
[5:10] uh when you leave and also given your
[5:12] email address if you're doing your
[5:14] couponing thank you brother
[5:23] you need to show a pants
[5:28] to make too many videos oh who needs the
[5:32] papers let me see the video of who wants
[5:35] to watch the video that was not here for
[5:37] the true couponing class that sister
[5:38] Michelle did last Sunday who needs a
[5:41] copy of that
[5:44] okay
[5:51] excuse me
[5:54] 16. so just make about 20 copies again
[6:02] he's about 17 that's about right
[6:06] 17. all right
[6:08] but anyway and what we're doing is I
[6:10] want to just kind of give you a little
[6:11] brief overview this is not just
[6:13] something to waste time with it's saving
[6:16] money but sister Michelle kind of came
[6:17] to us and gave us a a way last Sunday of
[6:21] of getting a food bank started in your
[6:24] church
[6:25] the way the couponing thing works is you
[6:27] say different kinds of coupons during
[6:29] this during the course of a month out of
[6:31] both paper then you take that you do a
[6:33] buy one get one free you do a two for
[6:35] one you do all these things but anyway
[6:37] like like you know Benny gave me eight
[6:40] rolls of rock guard one day and I
[6:42] thought why are you wasting money he
[6:43] said I got them all for like 80 cents
[6:49] sell them to somebody they'll just give
[6:51] them away but you can't do that but what
[6:53] we're going to try to do is we're going
[6:54] to try to get a food bank or a personal
[6:56] hygiene whatever you want to do whatever
[6:58] you want to call it together as a church
[7:01] and that way like with brother Timbo and
[7:03] Esther getting married and if some of
[7:05] you fall on the hard times we can put it
[7:07] in a box
[7:08] we can store at my house downstairs
[7:10] wherever we want to store it we can take
[7:12] that box and give it to you and it will
[7:13] house how many are you going to use
[7:15] eight cans of rice or anything to rock
[7:18] garden foreign
[7:23] but you know you're saying what are you
[7:25] going to do with eight tenths what keep
[7:26] one for yourself
[7:27] take the other seven and put them up
[7:30] then when somebody comes along with hard
[7:31] times or somebody needs a can of this or
[7:33] a can of that you know sister Michelle
[7:35] showed us at Walgreens they had this big
[7:38] huge huge
[7:41] pallet full wasn't it this high
[7:44] right everybody was there that pallet
[7:46] was this High full of drinks and
[7:48] miscellaneous items and four buggies at
[7:51] Walgreens
[7:52] they spent four dollars
[7:54] and 17 cents
[7:58] and you said well Walgreens well they do
[8:01] that if you'll go to that true couponing
[8:03] website Walgreens has put an ad on the
[8:05] one I saw Thursday that's begging people
[8:09] to come
[8:10] we will take your coupons see they get
[8:13] paid by buying them they get those
[8:15] manufactured coupons they get that money
[8:17] back plus they get eight cents to handle
[8:19] it so they're not losing money they're
[8:21] making money but Walmart I mean
[8:25] Walgreens
[8:26] if you're bringing a pallet out and
[8:28] putting a pallet in the manager the
[8:30] store associates and all those people
[8:31] get a bonus off of what they sell
[8:34] the volume
[8:36] so even on that true couponing the one
[8:38] in Sarasota Florida said we will accept
[8:39] and help you
[8:41] with your couponing so don't be don't be
[8:44] shy with doing this this is a great way
[8:46] like sister Michelle said it's a great
[8:48] way to bless somebody else
[8:50] God bless you to do what you're doing
[8:52] then you bless somebody else Jim the
[8:54] other day just kind of didn't have a
[8:56] coupon but she was using some a coupon
[8:58] somewhere and got like how many things
[9:00] of chapstick
[9:05] you know so
[9:07] so you see what I'm saying put some of
[9:09] those up and we'll we'll get a kind of a
[9:11] thing going where we can save some of
[9:13] that stuff and somebody gets married
[9:14] like Timbo hey how many of you would
[9:16] like to have a stock shelf when you
[9:17] first got married
[9:19] hello everybody we all won
[9:24] you know you'd open yours up and the
[9:25] mouse is going
[9:28] you know when you and I got married you
[9:30] know the mouse was poor as we were so
[9:34] but now we'll be able to bless somebody
[9:36] what I'm saying is it's not a con game
[9:38] it's not something these people want you
[9:40] to do that you know why it's brand
[9:42] recognition if you'll study all this
[9:44] stuff a lot of you that are in that are
[9:46] in retail and in marketing it's brand
[9:48] recognition what you see if you see a
[9:50] lot of Right Guard then guess what
[9:52] sooner or later you're going to buy some
[9:53] Right Guard or this or that yo so use
[9:55] these coupons get with brother Benny if
[9:57] you have any questions go to that
[9:59] truecouponing.com it will help you buy
[10:02] groceries even actually the other day
[10:04] from work she got online she saved 33
[10:07] dollars going to Kroger out of about 100
[10:10] worth of product which she saved 30
[10:13] percent
[10:14] you know on her own her bail on her
[10:16] group on her food bill so it's just
[10:19] something that's that's added to what
[10:21] we're doing with the Dave Ramsey course
[10:22] and I want to thank all of you that went
[10:24] through it most of you probably 90 of
[10:26] the church has been through it uh we
[10:27] paid off roughly in my figuring in my
[10:29] head about 75 000 in debt and from the
[10:32] two classes saved about thirty thousand
[10:35] dollars and avoided in close to four
[10:38] hundred thousand dollars in debt so give
[10:40] yourself a big hand because you're the
[10:42] one that did it
[10:44] and that's real money that's just not
[10:46] something that you play with so you know
[10:47] what God's Gonna bless you by blessing
[10:50] others all right and that's what we're
[10:52] here for we're here to bless other
[10:53] people not to bless ourselves you ought
[10:55] to know that from our pastor he's the
[10:57] greatest lesser of anybody I've ever
[10:59] seen in my life you know he does allow
[11:01] us to bless you so we're just giving
[11:03] some of that back so that we can help
[11:05] others and I want to thank each and
[11:07] every one of you for the gift on your
[11:09] last class you should not have done that

[26:52] freely and we thank you and we pray that
[26:54] you would just guide us now as we talk
[26:56] about you
[26:57] I'm talking about the Plan of Redemption
[26:59] that's it
[27:01] to see how others are redeemed and we
[27:03] see how that we are redeemed
[27:06] Lord we see that there's nothing worthy
[27:08] in any of us anywhere of any form or any
[27:12] people
[27:12] that have brought a Plan of Redemption
[27:15] unto us but it was because you promised
[27:18] it
[27:18] so now you've promised in this end time
[27:20] to open your word
[27:22] so now we ask you to do that and just
[27:24] got each one less
[27:26] the sick among us come and touch each
[27:28] one and just have your way in Jesus name
[27:32] amen
[27:34] Revelations
[27:36] one
[27:40] the revelation of Jesus Christ which God
[27:43] gave unto him to show unto his servants
[27:45] names which must shortly come to pass
[27:48] and he said and signified it by his
[27:50] Angel unto his servant John
[27:52] who by record of the word of God into
[27:54] the testimony of Jesus Christ remember
[27:55] what we're saying this morning now the
[27:57] testimony of Jesus Christ watch the
[28:00] others in a minute they have their own
[28:01] testimony but not this
[28:04] and of all things that he saw him they
[28:06] said is he that readeth and they that
[28:08] hear the words of this prophecy and keep
[28:10] those things which are written therein
[28:12] for the time is at hand
[28:15] Revelation 6 verse 9 and when he had
[28:19] opened the fifth seal I saw under the
[28:20] altar The Souls of them that were slain
[28:22] for the word of God and for the
[28:24] testimony in which they hailed see not
[28:27] the testimony of Jesus Christ but the
[28:28] testimony they held and they cried with
[28:31] a loud voice saying how long oh Lord
[28:33] holy and true this thou not judge and
[28:35] avenge our blood on them that dwell on
[28:37] the Earth
[28:39] and white robes were given unto every
[28:41] one of them and it was said unto them
[28:43] that they should rest yet for a little
[28:45] season until their fellow servants also
[28:49] and their Brethren that should be killed
[28:51] as they were should be fulfilled he may
[28:54] be seated the Lord had his blessings of
[28:57] the reading of the word
[28:59] now
[29:01] I was
[29:03] go back into the message this morning
[29:06] and then come back down to an end part
[29:09] so just bear with me
[29:12] who we've seen as the prophet said this
[29:14] is
[29:16] not the bride he used to think it was
[29:18] right that's right he used to think it
[29:20] was the bride of Christ the soldier
[29:22] under the altar that were martyred down
[29:23] through time right and he said that was
[29:25] not correct right and uh you know that
[29:28] he seen what it was and he said this is
[29:30] Israel to be saved as a nation right
[29:34] well see we never dealt with that
[29:35] Redemptive form of Israel being saved as
[29:39] a nation right we haven't dealt with
[29:41] that on the uh the prophet did but we
[29:46] haven't gotten into that to speak on it
[29:48] much because we've not heard a lot of
[29:50] ministers ministering on these things
[29:52] right amen but
[29:55] I believe it's time to understand the
[29:57] full Plan of Redemption and as I was
[29:59] telling my wife this morning if we don't
[30:01] get ever placed in other words each one
[30:04] in place of the Redemptive plan then we
[30:07] leave a gap in the Plan of Redemption
[30:09] seeing we wouldn't have to fully reveal
[30:12] Plan of Redemption so by way of the
[30:15] Prophet messenger my way that we've been
[30:17] bringing it see we can see the complete
[30:19] plan for everybody amen Old Testament
[30:21] Jews has a place the uh you know the
[30:25] bride of Christ has a place the uh the
[30:28] foolish virgins has a place to only 44
[30:31] 000 has a place amen and now we're
[30:33] talking about the fifth seal and their
[30:36] place and part in The Plan of Redemption
[30:39] that's right and I've told you over and
[30:41] over that to me and I've always preached
[30:44] it that way the greatest plant the
[30:45] greatest thought of of Grace
[30:48] it could ever be written in the word of
[30:50] God that's right
[30:52] he is not you and me you know right it
[30:56] is Israel right that God Will Save Right
[30:59] as a nation to give them eternal life
[31:02] one day and that they will
[31:06] you know then no way want it right they
[31:10] rejected it and they did not even 144
[31:13] 000 grew now to me when when you when I
[31:15] say 144 000
[31:17] and you'll see more as we go along I'm
[31:20] putting that 144 000 together with the
[31:22] the Israel of God because you cannot
[31:24] separate that too no all right the
[31:27] brother said to him a while ago he said
[31:28] uh and then when they're crying how long
[31:31] he said they're wanting that 144 000 to
[31:35] come on you're right they want to see
[31:38] what's going on right you know and uh
[31:40] but just think on these things now
[31:43] so we covered this morning and brought
[31:45] it down to to seeing that uh Paul said
[31:50] all Israel
[31:52] Romans 11 26 right along in there
[31:55] talking about all Israel would be saved
[31:58] now if you enjoyed the verse after verse
[32:01] of the scripture
[32:06] the word is true like I said I believe
[32:10] God opened them all to understand it
[32:12] right because he cried out you may not
[32:15] have I may not have finished my point
[32:17] but
[32:18] Solomon wanted wisdom and God saw that
[32:21] in his heart so he gave him wisdom and
[32:23] understanding of him and all and Paul
[32:26] wanted his people he saw was burden for
[32:29] his people Israel that's right until I
[32:32] believe he was crying out constantly and
[32:34] he was constantly quoting the scriptures
[32:36] of the Old Testament prophets and things
[32:39] that would talk about the Israel of God
[32:41] and so he didn't I believe the Lord just
[32:44] opened his eyes and let him see right
[32:46] down to the time that he said all Israel
[32:49] shall be saved right well we know that
[32:52] all Israel is
[32:54] never the right point to use we'll get
[32:56] to it in a minute that were he never
[32:59] said all Jews would be saved he said all
[33:01] this will be saved right amen he didn't
[33:04] say all Jews he didn't bring it that way
[33:06] so you'll get the point in a minute when
[33:08] we get to it
[33:10] but to see the Plan of Redemption for
[33:12] Israel
[33:14] and see the crying in Paul's heart
[33:17] you see God answering that with a
[33:19] revealing of the word unto him about
[33:22] what would happen to Israel after we
[33:25] leave out here right that's a great
[33:27] understanding no wonder Peter would say
[33:29] Paul says things hard to be understood
[33:33] and he said they that are not learned
[33:36] rational to their own destruction you
[33:40] know I mean he was he Peter new Paul was
[33:42] saying things and Paul said I saw things
[33:45] I can't talk about right amen well maybe
[33:48] he saw that fifth seal Jew
[33:50] you know maybe he saw his own people
[33:52] saved
[33:53] and he'd come back to try to tell him
[33:54] how can you tell it right because you
[33:57] came early childhood at night you know
[34:00] you can't even hardly get the people to
[34:02] see that there is a people that will be
[34:05] there right because God promised them to
[34:08] be there right
[34:11] and it won't be that they get borned
[34:13] again here right
[34:15] they have to receive eternal life
[34:17] somewhere though right
[34:19] but yet they'll be there in the great
[34:21] times if our own and won't it be
[34:24] wonderful to be able to think about that
[34:26] I've always wondered about the scripture
[34:28] because it says it will sit down at the
[34:30] welcome table with Abraham Isaac and
[34:32] Jacob right and my brother Tatum he
[34:35] always loved that scripture he quote
[34:36] that a lot and you know they're going to
[34:39] be at the welcome table right well I've
[34:41] always took it to be the welcome table
[34:43] would be the the marriage supper of the
[34:46] Lamb you know I mean that's what I
[34:48] believe it is and it may be something
[34:50] else too but I believe they'll be there
[34:52] I believe there's going to be there's
[34:54] always company in the wedding you know
[34:55] man and there's always a group of people
[34:57] in a wedding supper other than just the
[35:00] quote family you know members
[35:03] you always have guests of honor and
[35:05] things you know to be there but now
[35:08] see what up I ended up talking about and
[35:12] we gave it that even this this sealed
[35:15] Jew and I had never tied that together
[35:17] until our Wednesday night as it began to
[35:19] unfold
[35:22] and that's when I love to preach all
[35:24] right man I love to preach when I'm
[35:26] seeing something unfold
[35:28] that I haven't been preaching on it like
[35:30] that you know amen and uh I always just
[35:33] took the 144 000 has to be in the uh
[35:38] partial it you know we'd be dealing with
[35:40] Daniel 70 weeks right but then we gave
[35:42] the quotes there this morning where the
[35:44] Prophet said in the sixth full purpose
[35:46] right that that those people were
[35:49] blinded Their Eyes Were blinded right
[35:51] see the 144 000 is blinded I'm not sure
[35:55] so this puts 144 000 in the field still
[35:57] Jew kind of together in a way of
[36:00] understanding
[36:01] because see the 144 000 were blinded
[36:04] just as well as the other parts that
[36:06] were killed down through there
[36:08] they were blinded and they would be part
[36:10] of those groups coming down right
[36:12] that it would be the Israel of God you
[36:15] know God's chosen Nation
[36:19] and he gave and we were reading where
[36:21] Paul said this is my Covenant with them
[36:26] well if Abraham had a covenant
[36:29] it was certainly an unconditional
[36:31] Covenant
[36:34] nobody done anything to deserve it
[36:37] nobody was something special
[36:39] that would make them uh think is the
[36:42] reason that they're saved that's right
[36:44] and you can just you you start preaching
[36:47] like that and you can see people's
[36:49] Expressions as a kind of
[36:53] you know
[36:55] and you're kind of wondering
[36:57] maybe do they think that there is some
[37:00] good reason that they don't forget the
[37:01] inside is there any good thing you could
[37:04] do for salvation
[37:06] when Paul would explain that you could
[37:08] even give your body to be burned right
[37:10] right you know
[37:13] I mean you give everything in the world
[37:14] you had
[37:16] and that's the only gonna save you
[37:17] that's right amen all right that's
[37:21] that's just let's just get it down to
[37:22] the fact of what salvation really is
[37:25] it's the grace of God imparted unto
[37:28] mankind
[37:31] you're regardless of what category we're
[37:34] in
[37:35] it's not so we saw as it said in the
[37:38] Gabriel's instructions to Daniel
[37:40] paragraph 48 and 49. that these people
[37:43] in the that he's talking about under the
[37:46] six-fold purpose
[37:50] without the end of their sins done away
[37:53] and finish the transgressions and the
[37:55] things
[37:57] and all and it will probably apply to
[38:00] them
[38:00] as they see it so then truly Paul was
[38:04] correct
[38:06] if we see the 144 000 and like I said
[38:09] this morning then we'll get into it
[38:11] maybe in another service we're down and
[38:13] even mistaken out yeah Joseph and Levi's
[38:16] put in
[38:17] by doing that we know for a certainty
[38:19] there's going to be more than 144 000 in
[38:22] the millennium the prophet said to this
[38:24] then the the
[38:26] 144 000 would be in the millennial range
[38:29] right man all right so there's going to
[38:31] be more there than just what we think
[38:33] maybe all right
[38:36] so let's pick up the point where Paul is
[38:38] saying truly all Israel
[38:42] will be saved right
[38:46] God is going to save his people
[38:49] right we were talking about it at lunch
[38:50] dinner
[38:51] and what's the difference in God's
[38:53] people
[38:54] you know they were a chosen Nation Etc
[38:57] sure why didn't they get eternal life
[39:02] well there's some specific reason why
[39:05] and I I don't know why but for some
[39:08] reason he chose a gentile bride
[39:11] I don't understand that I'm truthfully
[39:15] I believe it
[39:16] got a part of it but maybe it's because
[39:20] it would be a gentile
[39:22] which would not mean just all that has
[39:25] said all Africans are all Germans
[39:28] whatever it would be everybody including
[39:30] Israel would have an opportunity of
[39:33] Salvation because of this diet this part
[39:36] started off
[39:38] with Jews that's right absolutely
[39:41] 120 in the upper room would Jews right I
[39:44] mean all right so our roots
[39:47] it's Jewish
[39:49] of the natural
[39:51] and our roots are Jewish in the
[39:53] spiritual right amen
[39:55] dude he didn't go out and get all the
[39:56] Gentiles and bring them in right until
[39:59] after he brought the Holy Ghost name
[40:01] amen all right
[40:05] see then we're dealing with 144 000
[40:07] you're dealing with only the elect
[40:11] not ever Israelite right amen when Paul
[40:15] was saying all Israel will be saved he
[40:18] didn't say all Jews
[40:20] he didn't say all Israelites
[40:24] he had he said that then God would have
[40:27] to save everyone
[40:29] but he said all Israel
[40:32] Israel is a reference to chosen it's
[40:36] like Jacob's name was changed
[40:39] right
[40:41] to Israel
[40:43] all right so then that means the chosen
[40:45] of God
[40:47] so there is a chosen group of people
[40:50] they were blinded amen so you and I
[40:52] could have eternal life amen so we
[40:55] couldn't need to quit tooting our horn
[41:01] who we are and look at who we are how
[41:04] did we get here right
[41:07] what did God have to do to get us a lot
[41:11] right amen a whole lot all right but now
[41:14] watch let's start off then where we left
[41:17] off on we was on number
[41:21] 10.
[41:24] so let's pick up the scriptures on
[41:25] number 11 and you'll notice we read this
[41:28] morning in Romans 11
[41:32] 13-26 or something 29 or something right
[41:36] Perfect all right so let's go to third
[41:38] number ten read it then go from there
[41:40] going down on a six-fold purpose you'll
[41:44] be Able's instruction
[41:45] oh
[41:47] I got 49. God cut them off purposely and
[41:50] blinded your eyes so that we can have a
[41:52] chance to see giving us an opportunity
[41:55] when we walk around like we're somebody
[41:56] yeah Paul tells him here take heed of
[42:00] how you do that take heed for God's
[42:03] spirit not the natural brain Israel
[42:06] how will we have any more Mercy will he
[42:10] have any more Mercy on the wild range
[42:12] right that's already what it's the
[42:14] Messer junk right
[42:16] do we walk around saying I'm
[42:18] Presbyterian I imagine this I'm bad this
[42:20] I'm Pinnacle I'm Grandma's now I hated
[42:22] that one right now okay
[42:26] let me add that one in there
[42:28] all right that don't mean nothing to God
[42:31] right no that's right amen you got to be
[42:34] born again of that Holy Spirit that come
[42:36] from the root
[42:39] that's right remember Jesus come from
[42:41] the tribe of Judah right
[42:44] not Naturally Speaking spiritually all
[42:46] right
[42:48] and remember he's not speaking of the
[42:50] Gentiles I'm just throwing this in here
[42:52] so that you can see where the Gentiles
[42:54] at they're changed they come to Phoenix
[42:56] with transgression make a finish of it
[42:59] right all right now let's read verse
[43:03] let's go to the Romans 11 go to verse 1
[43:06] through 13.
[43:07] now
[43:09] and you see what God is saying
[43:12] I say then
[43:15] if God Cast Away his people
[43:18] nosy Thomas Israel
[43:21] God forbid right
[43:24] in other words no
[43:26] where I also am an Israelite
[43:30] of the Sea of Abraham
[43:32] of The Tribe of Benjamin I used to think
[43:34] that he was giving that to try to show
[43:35] his legs but you know I believe now what
[43:38] he's doing he's giving that to show that
[43:41] he's the dirtiest of all and if he can
[43:43] see the dirtiest of all because he said
[43:45] he's the chiefess of sinners
[43:47] and God can save him he can save anybody
[43:51] you know what Paul even caused them to
[43:54] blaspheme
[43:57] now that's pretty bad no wonder them
[43:59] Fellers were scared of me in the book of
[44:01] Acts I mean wouldn't you be scared of
[44:04] somebody to come in here and turn it all
[44:05] of us in and they come in here and wipe
[44:07] the whole place out just about it and
[44:08] then I'll come walking back in you know
[44:10] all right
[44:11] y'all love me don't you no one's afraid
[44:14] of me all right but he don't know what I
[44:16] might do all right but now watch
[44:20] God has not Cast Away his people which
[44:23] he forew
[44:25] would you not what the scripture said to
[44:27] visas there's Isaiah Our Lives
[44:30] civilization
[44:32] how do you make this intercession to God
[44:34] against the Israel say Now read Isaiah
[44:37] and see what he's saying
[44:39] Lord
[44:41] Lord is in is is pleading the calls with
[44:46] God
[44:47] and Lord they have killed our Prophets
[44:50] and dig down to an altars and I'm left
[44:53] alone
[44:54] and they seek my life
[44:58] watching but once said the answer of God
[45:01] unto me
[45:02] I have reserved to myself seven thousand
[45:05] men who have not bowed the knee to the
[45:08] image above
[45:10] even so
[45:12] then at this present time also there's a
[45:16] remnant according to the election of
[45:19] Grace
[45:20] all right now
[45:23] ain't it by grace
[45:25] it is no more of words otherwise
[45:29] Grace is no more grace
[45:31] but if it really works then it is no
[45:33] more grace otherwise works is no more
[45:36] work
[45:38] man you know I kind of jumbled up don't
[45:40] it
[45:41] but look at it like this in plain sense
[45:43] it ain't nothing good what we've done or
[45:45] hadn't done that ain't got anything to
[45:46] do with it it's what he done and we can
[45:49] count our works as being something great
[45:50] work sin will just be worked right and
[45:54] all we've done is tired right
[45:56] you're tired because you work that's the
[45:59] basis of it just a good old mule right
[46:02] Murphy's a little chef to death he used
[46:04] to plow them they just plow all day long
[46:07] but you better be careful he's standing
[46:09] in the stall you think he's sound asleep
[46:12] and he walked by him and you kicked the
[46:13] far out of him
[46:16] worked them had a lot to do with them
[46:19] laughs
[46:21] the reason I did I've been down through
[46:23] there doing a lot of work in myself
[46:25] I would try I was good on you when I was
[46:28] in the bed
[46:29] right all right look what then
[46:33] Israel hath not obtained that which he
[46:36] seeketh far right
[46:38] now watching
[46:40] the vehicle you ain't got it yet right
[46:43] right
[46:44] but the election have obtained it
[46:48] and the rest were blinded now if that
[46:51] ain't enough to show you what God has
[46:53] done right
[46:55] right yep
[46:57] the elect
[46:59] is those that come into the body of
[47:01] Christ
[47:03] the other is Israel has not obtained
[47:05] that which he seeketh far
[47:08] you haven't got it yet but the election
[47:11] hath obtained it the people have come in
[47:13] to be the bride Paul Peter James John
[47:16] Jews right right
[47:19] and the rest were blinded what
[47:22] according as it is written
[47:26] God hath given them the Spirit of
[47:29] Slumber
[47:30] eyes that they should not see in the
[47:32] years that they should not hear unto
[47:34] this day
[47:36] and watch David now this is crying out
[47:38] for this fifth sealed Jew
[47:42] the children of Israel
[47:44] and David said
[47:46] let their table be a snare and a trap
[47:49] and a stumbling block and a recompense
[47:51] unto them right let their eyes be
[47:54] darkened that they may not see and bow
[47:57] down their back always
[47:59] he's not saying make that be he said
[48:01] that's what it's going to be
[48:07] how they stumble
[48:10] that they should fall
[48:13] God forbid amen but rather through their
[48:16] fall salvation is coming to the Gentiles
[48:18] part of provoke them to jealousy
[48:23] they're mad they're in there you go over
[48:25] it right man
[48:26] you get pushed around
[48:29] I was standing I told you about it I was
[48:32] standing getting ready to eat and I mean
[48:34] I was this close to the in the barn and
[48:37] the lady was serving us
[48:38] and this lady came up between me and
[48:40] nothing and got my food
[48:43] excuse me and then because she wouldn't
[48:46] go away
[48:51] all right
[48:55] I say to them have that strong
[48:57] limitation phone God forbid but rather
[48:59] through their false salvation just
[49:01] coming to the Gentiles
[49:03] more to provoke them
[49:05] to jealousy sure
[49:07] that's the dirtiest thing in the world
[49:09] for a Jew to think we're saved oh yeah
[49:11] absolutely I mean right you don't think
[49:14] we're saved he just using America
[49:16] you don't love America right
[49:28] evidently got something they can take
[49:30] the whole thing for right amen sure
[49:32] listen now to fall of them
[49:36] be the riches of the world
[49:39] because it extended down to time and do
[49:42] it right and the dimension of them
[49:44] The Riches of the Gentiles
[49:48] how much more their fullness right amen
[49:51] what about a time now then you pick up
[49:53] where we left off this morning
[49:58] and all Israel will be saved
[50:01] all Israel will come to Salvation
[50:05] now listen to what the prophet had to
[50:07] say about it number 12.
[50:10] I have a question and answered on the
[50:12] sale of paragraph 120. now yes
[50:15] these dudes are not
[50:18] all the Jews will be saved
[50:21] no sir
[50:22] they will not be saved only those who
[50:24] when he's speaking of of Jews
[50:28] Jew just is a name that was given to
[50:31] give to them after they left I believe
[50:34] never can ever over begin to call them
[50:36] Jews first
[50:38] because the tribe of Judah was taken
[50:41] then and given the name of Jew
[50:44] so if you ever need that you know that
[50:46] the prophet is covering it where the
[50:48] Jews were come in but the first word Jew
[50:51] is in
[50:52] um
[50:53] the Book of Esther
[50:57] because they came down from Judah and
[51:00] that they got the name of Jew but now
[51:03] Israel is different
[51:05] Israel and Jew is all together different
[51:10] I really that's right every Jew ever Jew
[51:13] isn't an Israelite all right you only
[51:16] deal with one tribe
[51:19] no he's just a Jew right but in Israel
[51:22] Paul never said all Jews will be saved
[51:25] that's right he said all Israel will be
[51:27] saved why Israel's name
[51:31] that's that's the name of Redemption
[51:34] all the way back right amen
[51:38] Israel is a name of redemption then all
[51:42] Israel will be saved but not all Judea
[51:45] Judaism
[51:46] uh we'll be saying all the Judaism and
[51:49] all that they will they won't be saved
[51:50] that's right amen why because that's not
[51:52] to you know that's not to be right all
[51:56] right
[51:57] let's see who this group is
[52:02] 4 45 in the
[52:05] field seal
[52:08] he's talking about Elijah Spirit coming
[52:10] down and what would take place now we
[52:12] find out in revelation 22 8 the same
[52:13] thing now or to settle it for those who
[52:18] the old souls now watch it under the
[52:20] altar of the breaking of this seal
[52:22] and that's then you can see them right
[52:24] that had been slain in the between time
[52:28] between the death of Christ and the
[52:31] going up to the church so there's your
[52:33] field sealed Jew between the death of
[52:35] Christ and the going up all right of the
[52:39] church the Eichmann group and all that
[52:41] them true Jews with their names on the
[52:45] book
[52:46] sure no only the ones that will ever be
[52:49] redeemed is or named on the book okay no
[52:52] matter who we are amen
[53:00] it's got to be on the book before the
[53:01] foundation of the world right if you
[53:03] watch my brother according to the
[53:06] scripture they could talk cry out speak
[53:08] here and had all five sanctions
[53:12] yep
[53:13] now they sold run to the Alder if he'll
[53:16] Shield you
[53:17] that's where I used to have it wrong I
[53:19] used to preach it
[53:21] that the theophany or the souls like
[53:24] that under the altar didn't have any
[53:26] senses
[53:28] it was just eternal life
[53:31] but I had to correct that in my my
[53:33] teaching because
[53:34] I began to see that brother Brown when
[53:36] he went beyond the curtain of time and
[53:39] we'll get to that in another message
[53:40] that's called Souls under the altar
[53:44] do not defeated you now right right when
[53:47] you say soldier under the altar how long
[53:49] wrote a randomly apply that to the bride
[53:52] right but when you say soldier under the
[53:54] altar how long to avenge our blood can't
[53:58] be the bride no that's right all right
[54:00] so then you'll see that as we go along
[54:02] the time between the death of Christ and
[54:05] going up the Eichmann group and all that
[54:07] were their name their them true Jews
[54:10] with their names on the book if you
[54:12] watch my brother according to the
[54:14] scripture they could talk cry and speak
[54:16] here and our all the five senses do we
[54:20] know for certain that was the soldier on
[54:21] the altar because the Bible called that
[54:24] not sleeping in the grave unconscious
[54:27] we'll cover that in a message there is a
[54:29] doctrine of Soul sleep right and there
[54:32] is a scripture that says the dead no not
[54:34] so they use that
[54:36] to to try to say that when you die you
[54:39] just you're just gone
[54:42] you're called Soul sleeping yeah
[54:44] yeah but everyone said don't believe
[54:46] that so you'll see that's another
[54:47] message
[54:48] they were very much awake I'd like to do
[54:50] that because I couldn't want to go and
[54:52] Julie come by and she said
[54:58] over my head this morning when you said
[55:01] Dan and Ephraim yeah and I tied in so I
[55:05] just gave her the places in the church
[55:06] age book and it's under the seventh seal
[55:09] if you want to read them it's 270 Church
[55:12] age book up to about 281 or two write it
[55:15] down and read it tells you about all the
[55:16] things that happened and then under the
[55:18] seventh seal
[55:23] missing numbers but it's over in the
[55:25] seventh seal he deals with Dan and
[55:27] Ephraim being taken out and put back so
[55:30] if you want to study it it's not
[55:32] all right
[55:34] they were very much awake and could talk
[55:36] speak hear anything is that right oh
[55:39] help us so those Soul drunk though sold
[55:42] under the order the fifth sealed Jew is
[55:44] not just a dead much or nothing
[55:47] hmm
[55:49] me just like beyond the curtain of time
[55:53] those were a well alive bunch of people
[55:55] that run around could feel see here
[55:58] right all right
[56:03] but their name my point is their names
[56:07] are on the book go to the next one
[56:09] they're 14.
[56:14] or page 274 the church handbook
[56:17] sardisian Church age
[56:19] this is not to suggest that there will
[56:21] be more names from the tribes of Israel
[56:24] remaining be will be no more names from
[56:28] the tribes of Israel remaining in the
[56:29] book of life for many of those but
[56:31] molecules through the principle of
[56:33] election will be in the Gentile Church
[56:35] yeah that's fine and coming through the
[56:37] body of Jesus Christ joined up their
[56:39] names did indeed remain in the book also
[56:42] also we will show according to the fifth
[56:44] seal multitudes of Martyrs martyr Jews
[56:48] we'll be giving white robes and eternal
[56:50] life by the Lord also the 144 000 would
[56:54] be sealed in his coming proven that
[56:56] their names were not deleted all right
[57:00] now
[57:02] he always believed that the souls under
[57:05] the altar was the early church
[57:09] go ahead with that one I think I used it
[57:11] this morning but we'll reuse it again
[57:13] I got 104 The Sixth Seal I always lie
[57:16] that soldier in the altar into the early
[57:18] Christian Church Martyrs but we found
[57:20] out last night when the Lord broke that
[57:22] seal for us it absolutely is impossible
[57:25] right
[57:26] it wasn't them they were gone on to
[57:28] Glory talking about the bride right well
[57:29] I'm on the other side and the Earth day
[57:31] was we found out that they were Jews
[57:34] that would come up during the time when
[57:37] the from the calling now of the 144 000
[57:42] watching now
[57:44] which we get into tonight and tomorrow
[57:46] and between the sixth and seventh seal
[57:49] 144
[57:50] 000 is called
[57:53] the word is this Jew gonna come up
[57:55] during
[57:59] so now he's putting 144 000 in the field
[58:02] sealed you right together in one
[58:03] statement
[58:05] are you reading it we found out that
[58:08] they were Jews they sealed you
[58:11] it would come up during the time where
[58:13] the from the calling now of 144 000.
[58:17] which we get into tonight and tomorrow
[58:18] night and between the sixth and seventh
[58:21] seal 144
[58:23] 000 is called and then we find out that
[58:25] they were martyred
[58:29] that had been killed and yet had not yet
[58:32] been had white robes on but their names
[58:35] had been in the last book of life and
[58:38] they were given white robes each one of
[58:40] them
[58:41] are you going there and separate 144 000
[58:44] from the fifth sealed you
[58:50] come on Reed you're supposed to read
[58:54] you can't separate them he's got them
[58:56] all together
[59:01] well we got a quote we'll get to later
[59:03] on another message
[59:04] we're going to run and said they're
[59:05] giving why I rode under the seventh seal
[59:07] right
[59:10] then we'll be back in a minute
[59:12] talk about that
[59:14] as to when will they get those rooms
[59:18] and what will happen
[59:20] but I want to cover one thing for
[59:22] certain
[59:24] he said well
[59:26] now I'll just believe right around
[59:29] you just take everything from it's all
[59:31] right I think we ought to
[59:33] you and what's wrong can be corrected
[59:37] and he didn't correct it we better watch
[59:38] what we do with it but now he gives
[59:42] evidence of why this is
[59:45] not the bride
[59:50] right
[59:51] well let's go through that and then
[59:52] we'll drop back go ahead to a number 16.
[59:55] I took part of the evening message
[59:57] shoved it up into the morning and we go
[59:59] okay
[1:00:01] that's why it's not underlined all the
[1:00:03] other would get it underlined
[1:00:06] page or paragraph 252 the fifth seal yes
[1:00:10] they held the word of God they were Jews
[1:00:12] they had their law they stayed with it
[1:00:14] and watch what they said they had their
[1:00:16] wall they stayed with it they keep the
[1:00:18] law right now they still set the tables
[1:00:20] they do everything just as according to
[1:00:22] their passovers and they do everything
[1:00:24] even at the Passover like well he was
[1:00:26] covering years ago and to pass over they
[1:00:28] have a play set for Elijah and they get
[1:00:31] up and they go to the door
[1:00:33] they opened the door
[1:00:36] and if he doesn't come in to close the
[1:00:38] door and set another year until next
[1:00:40] year until next year
[1:00:43] no they're keeping that law sure he's
[1:00:46] not gone about Wall Street punch
[1:00:49] right right right
[1:00:51] real crew Jews right right look around
[1:00:54] to dinner plowing yep
[1:00:58] the wooden Blaster right now we used to
[1:01:02] have wood glass knocks but we know what
[1:01:04] they got they got one thing and it goes
[1:01:07] down we've seen them when we're over
[1:01:08] there
[1:01:10] not two animals like we do they got one
[1:01:12] plow tank he's going and they probably
[1:01:14] even use wooden clowns
[1:01:17] but if it couldn't be that mental out to
[1:01:18] do it and he was something else
[1:01:20] all right but what
[1:01:23] they had their Lawless name with it
[1:01:25] you're a real nice night now they stayed
[1:01:27] with that and they were Jews
[1:01:30] and had a law and the law was the word
[1:01:33] of God
[1:01:34] they stayed right by it that's right
[1:01:37] now that's the fifth field you right the
[1:01:40] one who stayed with the word
[1:01:44] yep not everybody see all the Israel's
[1:01:46] not Israel right right man I want to do
[1:01:49] it all Israel's Israel but not all Jews
[1:01:51] right this and he says in that which
[1:01:54] we've read for the testimony they held
[1:01:57] what is their testimony
[1:02:01] what is the testimony of a true
[1:02:03] Israelite
[1:02:06] we are God's people Rabbi Richmond said
[1:02:10] I can't blame you can't have it that God
[1:02:14] chose us
[1:02:16] imagine
[1:02:18] their testimony is not of Jesus Christ
[1:02:21] their testimonies of the word to Hell
[1:02:24] the law that Jehovah right had given
[1:02:27] them amen
[1:02:33] they were martyred
[1:02:36] and year was sold under the altar
[1:02:39] after the church has been gone amen now
[1:02:44] watch
[1:02:45] they added their blindness
[1:02:47] martyred their Messiah
[1:02:52] and they were rich now they were reaping
[1:02:55] for it
[1:02:58] yeah and would you mind reading that
[1:03:00] next few words for me
[1:03:02] when I put this cough drop in
[1:03:05] no congregation reading
[1:03:09] they realized it
[1:03:15] what did they realize yep
[1:03:21] now where are they going to realize it
[1:03:23] yep that's right
[1:03:26] when are they going to realize it
[1:03:29] he's talking about Phil seals you ain't
[1:03:31] talking about 141 000 right you tell me
[1:03:35] if they'll see what you do
[1:03:37] look like Phil see what you one day is
[1:03:39] going to realize amen
[1:03:43] right and we're at William
[1:03:47] that he recognize after it was going on
[1:03:53] they've seen then when they come before
[1:03:57] the altar of God
[1:04:05] that's right I thought we were supposed
[1:04:08] to believe amen
[1:04:13] they're under the altar of God
[1:04:15] absolutely
[1:04:18] I saw shows under the altar right
[1:04:24] is that Revelation 5 how many
[1:04:26] Revelations 6 verse 9 right yes
[1:04:34] what altar
[1:04:38] of God
[1:04:40] they got a place yep
[1:04:42] if you understand
[1:04:45] That Old Testament people
[1:04:48] had a place
[1:04:50] you know what that was
[1:04:54] the faith of Abraham right made a place
[1:04:58] made a paradox
[1:05:05] now these are not put over there in the
[1:05:07] paradise it was left no no no amen
[1:05:10] Paradise was taken up amen the Bible
[1:05:12] says the prophet says that's right
[1:05:15] so this is under the altar
[1:05:20] they sing when they come before the
[1:05:23] altar of God
[1:05:26] now some were
[1:05:28] they're going to see the truth
[1:05:29] absolutely
[1:05:36] they'll cry how long
[1:05:38] to avenge
[1:05:40] but now you show me how afternoon them
[1:05:42] crying how long
[1:05:44] I want revenge either
[1:05:46] when they come out of that Altar and see
[1:05:48] what's happened
[1:05:49] they don't want revenge anymore
[1:05:52] they're giving my robes
[1:05:55] and we read it to you in Revelations
[1:05:58] right
[1:05:59] and was told to rest a little season
[1:06:03] until their fellow Brethren right right
[1:06:06] list them 144 000 right
[1:06:10] right a sealed
[1:06:12] so right prior to the ceiling of the 144
[1:06:16] 000 are them being taken away in their
[1:06:18] Redemptive plan
[1:06:22] you're gonna have to have us fulfilled
[1:06:24] you to receive eternal life
[1:06:31] I've always thought
[1:06:34] and I've always taught it from Kristen
[1:06:36] Moon
[1:06:38] that they would have to go to the white
[1:06:40] Throne judgment
[1:06:43] and receive eternal life
[1:06:46] I no longer believe that no
[1:06:50] no because if they get white rose
[1:06:54] before the 144 000 are killed
[1:06:57] is a vast amount of time before the
[1:06:59] watch on judgment comes which is like a
[1:07:01] millennium a thousand years and
[1:07:03] different things right
[1:07:08] and you can't take somebody to the white
[1:07:10] throne
[1:07:12] and stand before the white throne with
[1:07:14] eternal life
[1:07:15] absolutely not amen
[1:07:17] come on man don't take nobody to the
[1:07:21] watch room we got a judge with the Deeds
[1:07:23] Done in the body where they're good or
[1:07:24] bad and that's no why it's wrong come on
[1:07:29] that's 144 000 don't go to the white
[1:07:31] throne
[1:07:32] but yet they're not under the Bride of
[1:07:35] Jesus Christ right
[1:07:40] I said well I don't know that's what I
[1:07:42] said we miss and we did amen
[1:07:46] they come before the order of God now
[1:07:48] the grace of God is to them
[1:07:52] now watch
[1:07:54] now they could not by no means be Saints
[1:07:58] because they're already be Road
[1:08:01] but here they are now just sold Under
[1:08:04] The Altar for the word of God and the
[1:08:07] testimony of the hell for being God's
[1:08:10] people the Jews
[1:08:12] and that's something that's right
[1:08:16] how did they see him on the internet now
[1:08:18] they're slopping their gums that's okay
[1:08:22] but it's got to be salvation to Jesus
[1:08:24] Christ
[1:08:25] amen
[1:08:30] nobody goes to heaven without the
[1:08:33] Regency plan of the Lord Jesus Christ I
[1:08:36] don't care whether Jew Gentile or
[1:08:38] whatever
[1:08:40] it's through the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:08:42] amen amen the Old Testament sanctions as
[1:08:45] I said this morning
[1:08:46] the blood of Jesus Christ paid their
[1:08:48] price right that paradise could be taken
[1:08:51] up
[1:08:52] amen
[1:08:53] it was all through Jesus Christ Don't
[1:08:55] just run all see
[1:08:57] please
[1:08:59] but now watch the grace of God comes to
[1:09:01] them and Jesus gives them each one a
[1:09:04] white robe right watch
[1:09:07] come over after the church is gone
[1:09:11] so they don't happen till we get out of
[1:09:13] here right nope two points
[1:09:17] probably said they don't have them do we
[1:09:18] get out of here the Bible says they
[1:09:20] don't have it until
[1:09:23] I turn this to the 144 000. right but no
[1:09:27] one just probably tell you what I'm
[1:09:28] playing
[1:09:32] folks Brother Gary because you don't
[1:09:34] miss this point
[1:09:38] I don't believe when that
[1:09:43] receive eternal life
[1:09:45] now listen very closely
[1:09:49] I don't believe they get it until we get
[1:09:52] out of here
[1:09:53] right because if they've got eternal
[1:09:55] life they'd be in the bride right
[1:09:56] exactly right sure
[1:09:59] they're not giving eternal life until we
[1:10:02] leave
[1:10:04] I'm like I said and the brother caught
[1:10:06] it
[1:10:07] he said they're crying how long waiting
[1:10:09] on them 144
[1:10:11] 000. yep they feel the bull yeah that's
[1:10:15] right right yep
[1:10:18] but don't take them to the white room
[1:10:21] if I'm corrected by that I'll be glad to
[1:10:23] take correction if you can show me
[1:10:26] but for 40 something years
[1:10:29] I've studied that
[1:10:33] not just a week ago
[1:10:36] trying to see
[1:10:38] and understand
[1:10:40] sure made a lot of statements of my own
[1:10:43] but I'm always glad to come here and say
[1:10:45] all right I don't believe that anymore
[1:10:48] amen that's no problem to me
[1:10:51] well these people I don't believe what
[1:10:53] you said
[1:10:55] well maybe God will take care of it
[1:10:58] because I answered in good conscience
[1:11:00] right
[1:11:01] I don't mind telling you when I see you
[1:11:03] all right
[1:11:05] Jesus gives each one a white Road watch
[1:11:08] or more after the church had gone
[1:11:09] because they were all the way up to
[1:11:11] their calls and they were blinded and
[1:11:13] they didn't know it they didn't know it
[1:11:15] they were playing exactly the part of
[1:11:17] God right
[1:11:19] part that God had ordained for them to
[1:11:22] play
[1:11:26] he blinded them
[1:11:28] we know where to hang the plan right
[1:11:31] for them to come in
[1:11:33] and here here John looks over it's easy
[1:11:35] sold under the honor and what you see
[1:11:38] his old souls watch what he calls him
[1:11:41] they cry Lord how long what
[1:11:44] just a little longer knee let's get that
[1:11:48] as we go down
[1:11:52] they realized that they murdered the
[1:11:54] Messiah yep they didn't know it but then
[1:11:57] they realized it
[1:12:00] now that was some more folks
[1:12:02] that's right they got they got murdered
[1:12:05] back to pay for it
[1:12:07] for doing the wrong
[1:12:09] and now look what the thing they had to
[1:12:12] do
[1:12:13] they would guilty of murder
[1:12:15] well they got murdered see they cried
[1:12:18] out his blood be on us yeah that's right
[1:12:21] and they were blinded
[1:12:23] and if if they hadn't been blinded
[1:12:27] God said let them alone
[1:12:29] look
[1:12:32] you understand what he's saying man
[1:12:34] see it's not God saying leave him alone
[1:12:37] they're not worthy
[1:12:38] if that's the way he said it he would
[1:12:40] just wipe them off right right are you
[1:12:43] reading I mean read what he's just
[1:12:45] saying but being that they was blinded
[1:12:47] by God his grace reached down to them
[1:12:49] amen talk about Amazing Grace and give
[1:12:52] each one of them a robe because all
[1:12:54] Israel would be saved everyone that has
[1:12:57] his name written
[1:12:58] that's right amen all Israel is to be
[1:13:01] saved
[1:13:03] to be brought in
[1:13:13] let's see going to the next
[1:13:16] 17.
[1:13:18] going to eat me
[1:13:23] and we read that one
[1:13:26] we read that all through them
[1:13:32] we'll go by snake and we read it with
[1:13:36] I guess we didn't I thought I was posted
[1:13:38] two different sections
[1:13:40] this is paragraph 269 of the fifth seal
[1:13:42] now notice though they had tried to get
[1:13:45] rid of Joseph his grace reached to them
[1:13:48] and you remember the story how that they
[1:13:51] tried to kill him you know when they
[1:13:52] tried next no we won't kill him we'll
[1:13:53] put him down here and sell it
[1:13:55] no they tried to get rid of Jesus he
[1:13:58] still comes right back around
[1:14:00] because he was blind
[1:14:03] and gives him each one of what road
[1:14:07] yep now you remember the statement I
[1:14:09] gave the other night wrote around and
[1:14:10] said seeing it like that he said you
[1:14:12] could crawl under a concrete block with
[1:14:13] a 10 gallon hat I will never touch it
[1:14:15] yep That's how little it makes
[1:14:18] yes sir
[1:14:20] I live blind and give them each one a
[1:14:22] white robe he's going to take them right
[1:14:24] on in on anyhow
[1:14:27] it doesn't make a bit of difference
[1:14:30] because he done said I'll save them all
[1:14:34] anyhow
[1:14:35] I like that much man burst him notice
[1:14:38] they asked for Revenge see now
[1:14:41] and if they had been the bride
[1:14:44] it'd have been like Stephen father for
[1:14:47] him so his name's proven this is not a
[1:14:49] born-again Christian it would have to be
[1:14:52] sold on the all of the Jews you know but
[1:14:55] these are Jews that's just come in see
[1:14:57] they asked for Revenge notice again see
[1:15:00] again he said notice it's not he said
[1:15:02] it's not brethren
[1:15:05] the Jews 144 000 you remember until thy
[1:15:08] Brethren are sealed
[1:15:10] and they wanted Revenge they said oh
[1:15:12] we're going to we want you to Revenge us
[1:15:15] down there
[1:15:19] that's what they're doing until they get
[1:15:21] white robes
[1:15:22] yep once they get the White Road they
[1:15:25] won't Revenge no more once they get on
[1:15:27] that Altar and see God we're just
[1:15:28] reading the quote from above he said yes
[1:15:30] for a little while now just a little
[1:15:32] while for a notice let me read it here
[1:15:34] it's in the 10th verse all right
[1:15:38] Lord how holy and true of this thou not
[1:15:41] judge and avenge our blood on them that
[1:15:43] dwell on the earth and white roads were
[1:15:45] given to every one of them and it would
[1:15:47] stay at the age reading the scripture
[1:15:48] unto them that they should rest yet a
[1:15:51] little season see watch a little season
[1:15:53] until their fellow servants see now
[1:15:56] what it is the prophets now are
[1:15:59] preaching to Israel
[1:16:02] our servants also
[1:16:04] my fellow servant and also got Brethren
[1:16:07] they should be killed see the ones
[1:16:10] that's predestinated to be done so you
[1:16:13] should to be killed as they were should
[1:16:15] be fulfilled amen see once they're given
[1:16:18] white robes
[1:16:21] it's going to be ice with rapture
[1:16:25] 144 000 is going to get white robes
[1:16:30] after the Rapture
[1:16:32] which is eternal life right amen
[1:16:36] but the two witnesses and all the
[1:16:38] records you have of a Rapture right
[1:16:41] he doesn't mention
[1:16:43] 144 000 going up in a rapture
[1:16:46] and all the studying I've done I can't
[1:16:48] find right around saying they go
[1:16:50] I always believed it did because where
[1:16:52] else would you put them right that's
[1:16:54] right amen
[1:16:56] but maybe a little bit different amen
[1:17:01] notice again and he said there's nothing
[1:17:03] he said it's not brother the Jews the
[1:17:05] hundred
[1:17:06] now they wanted Revenge they said oh
[1:17:08] we're going we want you to Revenge us
[1:17:10] down there he said just go to the wild
[1:17:12] man just a little while notice let me
[1:17:15] read it here as soon as Tim's version
[1:17:16] all right
[1:17:18] they cried with a loud voice saying how
[1:17:20] long the Lord only in truth does thou
[1:17:22] not judging avenge our blood on them
[1:17:24] that dwell on the earth and white robes
[1:17:26] were given to every one of them and it
[1:17:28] was said unto them that they should rest
[1:17:29] in a little season watch a little season
[1:17:32] until they're fillers service
[1:17:34] now what is the prophets now are
[1:17:37] preaching to Israel
[1:17:40] amen
[1:17:42] the prophets are preaching to Israel
[1:17:45] while he's telling them
[1:17:48] just hold on just a little while
[1:17:53] I'm making a way
[1:17:56] we're here to be real right right right
[1:17:59] I'm making a way
[1:18:02] that you can be brought in
[1:18:06] the bride don't cry for Revenge
[1:18:12] go to the next one
[1:18:15] already
[1:18:16] I got 106. six seal we took that and
[1:18:20] there's nothing in the world I don't
[1:18:21] believe
[1:18:22] but that bunch of of the Jews have went
[1:18:26] through a pre-tribulation period
[1:18:28] when during the time of this life's Wars
[1:18:30] they were
[1:18:32] they they've got to be hated by
[1:18:34] everybody nightclub and killed Millions
[1:18:37] with them in Germany we just read the
[1:18:39] trial you heard the trial lens of
[1:18:42] innocent people slang Jews just because
[1:18:44] they were Jews no other reason the Bible
[1:18:47] said to hear that they were slain for
[1:18:48] their testimony of God or the the word
[1:18:51] of God and the testimony of the hell now
[1:18:54] we find out that the bride was the word
[1:18:56] of God and the testimony of Jesus Christ
[1:19:00] these had no testimony of Jesus Christ
[1:19:02] and we find out that the Bible says that
[1:19:06] all Israel the predestinated Israel will
[1:19:08] be saved Romans 11 and we know that and
[1:19:11] there we've seen them Souls all right
[1:19:22] they're not
[1:19:24] I'm gonna go ahead and put this quote in
[1:19:25] here where you can argue
[1:19:29] because it sounds and this is what I've
[1:19:30] always stated and don't go ahead to 19.
[1:19:34] and I've always thought that the souls
[1:19:36] under the altar in the field sealed you
[1:19:37] had to go to the white Throne to receive
[1:19:39] eternal life
[1:19:40] I always thought that
[1:19:42] and I had this quote to go with it to
[1:19:44] see
[1:19:45] because of this statement it is in the
[1:19:48] second resurrection that the soldier
[1:19:49] under the altar is set forth in the
[1:19:51] fifth seal Revelation 6 9-11 are given
[1:19:54] Rock robes and of course
[1:19:55] eternal life or there would be no point
[1:19:57] of light roads
[1:19:58] we go to the fifth seal
[1:20:01] and watch
[1:20:06] and the crime of the loud voice going
[1:20:08] down to the where he starts his
[1:20:10] paragraph
[1:20:12] I don't know now no particular that none
[1:20:14] of these under the altar were killed for
[1:20:15] the testimony of Jesus they were not
[1:20:18] like Antipas who was slain
[1:20:20] were holding fastest name
[1:20:22] these are not born again ones with
[1:20:25] eternal life as their possession they
[1:20:27] come up in the resurrection
[1:20:30] and receive life because of their stand
[1:20:32] on the word notice how these are crying
[1:20:36] out or the engines they cannot be dried
[1:20:39] material the bride turns the chief and
[1:20:42] Christ forgive them Father they don't
[1:20:43] know what they're doing
[1:20:45] yeah listen
[1:20:49] let's get to the last one let me get
[1:20:51] through
[1:20:56] the millennium
[1:20:59] is to the Jews
[1:21:02] right we are there on the honeymoon
[1:21:05] that's it
[1:21:08] there is a millennium Temple to be built
[1:21:10] according to Daniel 70 weeks and he gave
[1:21:12] Ezekiel 40-44.
[1:21:16] until time will be built
[1:21:19] all right
[1:21:21] and we come back that Temple as I've
[1:21:24] said
[1:21:25] is not built
[1:21:27] as a sacrifice of altars and things it's
[1:21:31] not there
[1:21:32] it's a temple
[1:21:35] because they know who the
[1:21:37] the lamb is right but it's built there
[1:21:41] to remind
[1:21:42] the Israelites
[1:21:45] and God's promise to them right
[1:21:48] who would be better to go back and build
[1:21:51] it than Israel absolutely amen
[1:21:54] the Millennium is to Israel yep
[1:21:59] because it's a promise in the Bible
[1:22:03] to David that his son would sit on his
[1:22:06] throne
[1:22:09] Solomon fulfilled the natural
[1:22:12] Jesus will be the son of David
[1:22:18] Son of God Son of Man son of David
[1:22:23] right
[1:22:24] Jesus will be the son of David in the
[1:22:27] millennium
[1:22:32] he was not the son of David
[1:22:35] so the woman that cried out son of David
[1:22:37] have mercy on me
[1:22:40] you didn't answer
[1:22:43] because he was not in the office of son
[1:22:45] of David he was in the office of Son of
[1:22:47] Man
[1:22:48] all right but when she said Lord
[1:22:51] he heard her right because he wasn't
[1:22:54] Lord
[1:22:56] she had right calling that
[1:22:58] you see why it would take months to just
[1:23:00] keep on preaching on it
[1:23:04] was he in the Millennium he'd be son of
[1:23:06] David
[1:23:07] sitting on the throne of David
[1:23:11] and Israel will be there
[1:23:13] right the prophet said to 144 000 we'll
[1:23:16] be there in the millennial reign
[1:23:21] as eunuchs to the bride
[1:23:23] we'll get to it later when we cover Dan
[1:23:25] and Ephraim how they want to take an out
[1:23:27] put back in what happens
[1:23:30] well he's bound to be 144 000 plus 24
[1:23:33] 000.
[1:23:35] in the Millennium the Jews
[1:23:42] what would be wrong with that field
[1:23:44] sealed you
[1:23:45] come on join up in the millennium
[1:23:48] that would fulfill all of the scriptures
[1:23:53] amen absolutely
[1:23:56] of David and his throne
[1:23:59] and God's chosen people
[1:24:02] and they would still be his chosen
[1:24:04] people
[1:24:05] but there's a vast difference between
[1:24:06] chosen people and bride of Christ
[1:24:11] right of Christ's going to be there on
[1:24:12] the honeymoon
[1:24:14] Israel is going to be there at 144 000
[1:24:16] this service to the bride
[1:24:18] somebody's going to build that
[1:24:20] millennium
[1:24:22] Temple
[1:24:23] and there's going to be a millennium
[1:24:25] right let's go to the 20 number 20.
[1:24:30] all right
[1:24:31] I had a museum
[1:24:35] paragraph 290 of the new seal
[1:24:39] and they said
[1:24:41] much
[1:24:43] why can't we go back to the kingdom
[1:24:45] right now
[1:24:48] he said where's that in the Bible not in
[1:24:50] there right
[1:24:53] the statement is how long how long right
[1:24:59] the statement is they're saying how long
[1:25:02] how long so in brother random translated
[1:25:05] he said what
[1:25:08] my
[1:25:10] why can't we go back to the kingdom
[1:25:12] right now
[1:25:15] to his evidence they're going to show
[1:25:17] itself to him
[1:25:21] and they're questioning how long
[1:25:23] why can't we go back to the kingdom
[1:25:25] right now
[1:25:32] watch it
[1:25:33] the Jewish kingdom is to be set on the
[1:25:37] Earth
[1:25:38] we are in the kingdom of God spiritual
[1:25:40] right but the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:25:44] you know John said the kingdom is in
[1:25:47] heaven
[1:25:50] to be said
[1:25:52] and this is the kingdom of the Gospel
[1:25:55] amen
[1:25:56] see we're in the Kingdom of the Gospel
[1:25:58] right
[1:26:00] but the kingdom of the Jews will be
[1:26:02] preached
[1:26:04] by
[1:26:07] two Prophets
[1:26:09] yep
[1:26:11] those two prophets have got a great
[1:26:13] message to bring right
[1:26:15] because they're going to tell them we're
[1:26:17] going into millennium
[1:26:19] sure we're going to see the Fulfillment
[1:26:23] no wonder brothers and mothers that's
[1:26:24] under the altar they feel that pool
[1:26:26] that's right
[1:26:31] with the kingdom of the Jews will be
[1:26:33] preached by these two prophets to notice
[1:26:35] the kingdom of the earth here
[1:26:37] the Kingdom of Heaven is preached by the
[1:26:39] Jews or listen I mean to the Gentile
[1:26:43] the king of Heaven is preached to the
[1:26:44] Gentiles right goodbye
[1:26:47] they came here on Earth is to be set up
[1:26:49] in the millennium
[1:26:51] after the Millennium to the Jews
[1:26:54] they were Dr Storms right
[1:26:56] and I noticed notice this now here while
[1:26:59] while they are preaching City before
[1:27:02] these these prophets ever arise on the
[1:27:05] scene
[1:27:06] these Jews that had to die unto item in
[1:27:09] them each one of them that's
[1:27:10] predestinated
[1:27:12] is given on my rope
[1:27:16] and each one of them is given a light
[1:27:18] robe
[1:27:20] assuming that takes place
[1:27:23] did you read
[1:27:28] the Bible says
[1:27:30] Revelation 6 9 of friction 11.
[1:27:36] until your father brethren
[1:27:39] and giving white robes and then the 144
[1:27:41] 000 are going to be killed that's right
[1:27:43] did you read that there
[1:27:46] or did you miss it
[1:27:50] right there in that quote
[1:27:53] toilet three reasons
[1:27:56] and I mean to the Gentile the kingdom uh
[1:27:59] here on the earth is to be set up in the
[1:28:01] millennium
[1:28:03] the Millennium is to the Jews correct
[1:28:05] all right
[1:28:07] after the Millennium to the Jews now
[1:28:10] notice this now
[1:28:14] year while they are preaching
[1:28:16] who right right who's preaching City
[1:28:21] before these these prophets ever arise
[1:28:25] on the scene
[1:28:28] before the prophets arise on the scene
[1:28:34] really
[1:28:38] these Jews that had to die under
[1:28:40] Eichmann still and then each one of them
[1:28:44] that's predestinated
[1:28:46] is given by Grace a white robe
[1:28:50] to the Thirsty prophet
[1:28:54] he says they'll get white rose
[1:28:56] before the 144 thousand
[1:28:59] get killed
[1:29:03] all right if they got white roads where
[1:29:05] you gonna put them
[1:29:13] what position you gonna put
[1:29:17] I don't believe you can put them into my
[1:29:18] Throne nope
[1:29:20] no ain't gonna put them into my Throne
[1:29:21] they already got it right right man
[1:29:24] 144 000 don't go to the white Throne
[1:29:27] they already got it right the only ones
[1:29:29] going to watch their own response right
[1:29:32] because they don't have it
[1:29:34] they have a confession but not a
[1:29:37] possession
[1:29:41] and brother Richard Wilson and I've been
[1:29:43] talking this morning to quite a bit on
[1:29:44] this
[1:29:45] because you that are listening to him
[1:29:46] you hear him say
[1:29:48] some things
[1:29:50] in the last couple of messages
[1:29:52] not formation
[1:29:55] where he's covering that you don't
[1:29:57] believe that the 144 000 will be killed
[1:30:02] until after the two prophets are killed
[1:30:07] the two prophets are killed going to
[1:30:08] Rapture then 144 000 are killed
[1:30:13] and he said he believed they would step
[1:30:14] over and God would raise him up in the
[1:30:16] millennium
[1:30:17] in glorified bodies
[1:30:20] I know for sure they're going to be in
[1:30:21] glorified bodies in the Millennium of
[1:30:23] that amen yep
[1:30:28] but you don't have no record of a
[1:30:29] Rapture for the 144 thousand
[1:30:32] that's right
[1:30:36] they gotta go somewhere gotta do
[1:30:38] something
[1:30:41] so then I could see I'm not saying that
[1:30:43] I know it and agree or understand or
[1:30:45] whatever
[1:30:46] I'll just say I can see because of what
[1:30:49] I see
[1:30:50] right I see the fifth seals you
[1:30:55] is going to be given eternal life
[1:30:58] and they're going to recognize Jesus
[1:31:00] Christ
[1:31:07] well they're the souls under the altar
[1:31:12] now how are you going to get them back
[1:31:13] here to Earth yeah
[1:31:15] and where are they coming
[1:31:24] could it be
[1:31:26] it's 144 000 Plus or 24 000. raised in
[1:31:31] the Millennium in the glorified bodies
[1:31:34] and could it be to feel sealed you will
[1:31:37] also be raised her
[1:31:39] yep
[1:31:41] because in the Millennium they will be a
[1:31:43] gospel to the heater which will be
[1:31:46] raised from the dead
[1:31:48] that will not be the fifth sealed Jew no
[1:31:51] it's a gospel to the Heathen that
[1:31:54] Heathen will be normal
[1:31:57] people
[1:31:58] not Eternal people
[1:32:03] can't find it nowhere No Redemption for
[1:32:06] us
[1:32:07] you got the words of the Prophet that
[1:32:08] they'll be there
[1:32:11] you have no records or scriptures and
[1:32:14] things it's 144 000 will be in the
[1:32:17] millennium but you got to profit that
[1:32:20] says it will right
[1:32:26] when we leave out of here
[1:32:29] Israel starts getting the message right
[1:32:31] right yes sir and they started getting
[1:32:33] that message when they do God's got a
[1:32:37] work to do
[1:32:39] I was asked a question
[1:32:45] said according to what our understanding
[1:32:50] see Jesus goes with us to the marriage
[1:32:52] supper
[1:32:54] who said you guys are saying it's going
[1:32:56] to be
[1:32:57] three and a half more years
[1:32:59] after that
[1:33:01] Jacob's trouble
[1:33:04] he said what's Jesus going to be doing
[1:33:12] he's not going to work yeah sure
[1:33:19] he crew was crucified
[1:33:25] his soul went to hell
[1:33:31] to the Lost
[1:33:33] you agree
[1:33:35] you come back up and picked up the Old
[1:33:37] Testament Saints you agree
[1:33:40] why couldn't he go
[1:33:42] to Israel
[1:33:46] but around said he takes us to the
[1:33:48] marriage supper and this is where he
[1:33:50] said and Slips Away
[1:33:53] comes down here
[1:33:55] according to Daniel 70 weeks
[1:33:59] 144 000 don't see Jesus until in the
[1:34:03] millennium
[1:34:07] nobody he's not here in Corporal body
[1:34:09] when he's appearing through the two
[1:34:10] witnesses
[1:34:12] all right
[1:34:14] The Plan of Redemption is unfolding
[1:34:19] whom God is doing it amen
[1:34:24] they feel
[1:34:27] that pool when we go out of here
[1:34:31] let me quote another one
[1:34:34] but around said they see
[1:34:38] that light glorifier the Halo
[1:34:44] coming after the bride
[1:34:47] and blankets coming after them
[1:34:52] it's his words
[1:34:57] so now you got the feel seals you a
[1:35:00] place to go
[1:35:02] you don't put her before they watch your
[1:35:04] own
[1:35:05] because she already has eternal life
[1:35:09] now you can put her in the Millennium
[1:35:11] and see the dead can be raised and go
[1:35:14] into the millennium
[1:35:15] the literal dead people can be raised
[1:35:17] and put into the Millennium has to be a
[1:35:20] heater and that the gospel can be
[1:35:22] preached to
[1:35:25] we also see that that fair CO2 can be
[1:35:27] there
[1:35:28] because it's to Israel
[1:35:34] and I see it
[1:35:36] take all these things
[1:35:39] like I told Brother Richard this morning
[1:35:40] I said brother
[1:35:42] and I know he's thinking the same thing
[1:35:46] whether or not it would be this way or
[1:35:48] whether or not it would be that way
[1:35:52] but we see the Plan of Redemption
[1:35:54] amen at least we're talking about a
[1:35:57] Redemption
[1:35:59] okay for everybody else is just Glory
[1:36:02] Hallelujah how great we are and how we
[1:36:04] always was eternal and how that we don't
[1:36:06] need this and we don't need that church
[1:36:08] we need to ever to have a Redemption we
[1:36:11] can find amen and that field sealed you
[1:36:14] I've told you over and over is the
[1:36:17] greatest example of Grace
[1:36:21] that could ever be given to any mankind
[1:36:25] right amen and he would save them right
[1:36:29] that don't even want to be saved
[1:36:33] you know that brother around said he
[1:36:34] heals him Jews every day right now he
[1:36:37] said they still don't believe him in
[1:36:38] this as their healer
[1:36:41] if they're healed they've got to be
[1:36:42] healed by Jesus Christ right
[1:36:45] right where are we at
[1:36:49] so then maybe I was right
[1:36:51] when I said
[1:36:53] the first four seals shows the Plan of
[1:36:56] Redemption right
[1:36:59] justification sanctification the baptism
[1:37:01] on the Holy Ghost and the revealed word
[1:37:05] Bill six and seventh shows how he done
[1:37:07] it
[1:37:08] how did he do it justification
[1:37:10] sanctification the baptism in the Holy
[1:37:12] Ghost right around said seventh seal
[1:37:15] continue on with the same simple message
[1:37:18] or you will work yourself away from the
[1:37:22] truth
[1:37:23] that's a paraphrase but it's pretty
[1:37:25] close
[1:37:32] but I'd heard and now we have it back
[1:37:34] there in the office
[1:37:37] that they were saying now that they had
[1:37:39] a drawing
[1:37:42] and they put up
[1:37:45] that Jesus comes 69 and then preach
[1:37:47] three and a half years so he'd make 69
[1:37:49] nights back there in three and a half
[1:37:51] over here
[1:37:52] in Utah
[1:37:56] and they got their drawing
[1:37:59] but we are the drawing we're brought
[1:38:01] around it was verified and
[1:38:03] proven to be true
[1:38:05] did he preach you 69 weeks to the cross
[1:38:09] and one week left at Israel amen right
[1:38:12] after Rapture in the church amen
[1:38:17] but you know what you think that's going
[1:38:19] to change any of those people I asked a
[1:38:21] brother to personally send a certain
[1:38:23] brother a copy of the real drawing of
[1:38:27] the Daniel 70 weeks
[1:38:29] you think that'll change anything
[1:38:37] the golf people will say we don't know
[1:38:39] which one's true
[1:38:43] the drawing Ain't Gonna Save You
[1:38:48] when I want to see 69 and a half weeks I
[1:38:51] want quotes I want scripture
[1:38:54] I want the Bible any word or the prophet
[1:38:58] any word to say that no no sir
[1:39:02] but yet the vast majority of this
[1:39:04] message believe that
[1:39:15] come on
[1:39:17] take on these things
[1:39:23] The Plan of Redemption
[1:39:27] we'll get into the souls Under The Altar
[1:39:29] and cover more about the soul
[1:39:31] remember more about Eichmann and Hitler
[1:39:33] and all of that
[1:39:34] the killing of all of them
[1:39:37] get under the vanity for him
[1:39:42] foreign
[1:39:47] like most people are running out of
[1:39:49] something to preach
[1:39:50] I'm just getting to the place I can
[1:39:52] preach
[1:39:54] I'm seeing everything just unfolding
[1:39:56] amen
[1:39:59] I ain't seen an end to it yet
[1:40:03] now I won't if it's a plan every day if
[1:40:06] it ain't I don't mind telling you I was
[1:40:09] wrong
[1:40:11] I've never had any trouble saying I used
[1:40:14] to think it was this because now I think
[1:40:16] it's that
[1:40:18] never had any trouble huh I've said it
[1:40:21] many times what do we got brother 145 in
[1:40:24] the red book 145 on the red book anybody
[1:40:26] have a need
[1:40:29] remember these that are traveling

[1:40:33] traveling down to where the colleges you
[1:40:36] just want to be down there hunting with
[1:40:37] us but they ain't gonna get the hunt to
[1:40:38] use it even in some way we've got to
[1:40:40] figure out some way to have services in
[1:40:42] the wood in the woods I guess
[1:40:44] or later on their average because we
[1:40:47] want to hunt till dark right and then we
[1:40:50] can maybe you know
