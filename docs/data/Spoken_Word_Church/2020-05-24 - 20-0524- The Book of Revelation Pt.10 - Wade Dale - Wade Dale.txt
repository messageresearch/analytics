========================================

all right real quickly here they're gonna be here today this is vegan service of Lord coming in so just obey Him in trying about get this thing over with far they can go you know all right so we're probably last study about the Laodicean Church a layout in church JS is the last Church a I think some water an island then we're coming in so they the Laodicean Church age the property God tells us was the worst church age of all of them because everybody thinks they're right I am ready increased with Goods and have need of nothing no it's not that don't wretched miserable poor blind naked you don't know it go over paraphrasing one program said that there's a group of people that this is the most religious time supposedly the best illumination of Revelation this is the this is the greatest hour of all the church ages because they've all went through the different stages when we've been through all the different stages and then we just come with Luther Wesley and Pentecost and then we were with just the case that getting back to in an idea like you were talking about last Monday about the half tribal Manassas was on this side of Jordan and half of it went across from the other side of Jordan which means that the holy ghost there's more to the holy ghost than just receiving the baptism of the holy ghost okay and that's what - it's good the days would come through that brother Graham some with the prophet and God sent us a prophet and our sentence probably tell us what what you tell us okay he told us how to get back to this trkage right here but then you got a plus it and give it more to revelation 10 7 in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he begins us down the mystery of God should be finished they didn't have the mystery they had part of the mystery you am NOT a human being part of the sewol church age number seven is completion so this completes the mystery all right so that's 100 that the Prophet told us there was a lot of light in these first ages that went out almost completely that's why they call it the Dark Ages and then you see a little shoot I mean a little to Sprague's means to shoot and then you see the shot but that's really not the seed the seeds in them all my corn in plans that we planned and all the other things they ever been of the fruit that we're going to harvest you can harvest one one speck of it at this moment but if you didn't able to plant it and you just looking up there and you see this bear and field let's get out the problem hey why yes but the analogy I want to show you is is you you're like a farmer that walks out into the field and he's planted nothing zero and he walks out in the field in two months later you go for now I'm going to get corn three months later I've got corn coming up and I'm gonna harvest my corn if you look out then it's just a barren field well that's what it's talking about you say I am rich you say that your increased with goods that you're going to get this bountiful harvest you won't have the feeling you go where's the did you know let it plant nothing but but we can get a harvest that's what the whole problem is now mm-hmm I say when I say denomination the world I don't mean them out there I mean the ideas that we go denominational ideas we have are not see they might be seed but they're we'd see they're not grain they're weeds go deers gonna weed will come up because we've to see a siege don't come out of the ground they come up yeah we know that jinda okay well we have to cut them down little uh we can't live with well cut them they only Jim said yesterday we were pulling corn there was a lot of weeds and she said can't we just use this for salad or something right can't we just let this grow and and it's green and it looks good piece of plan but that's the same thing I was thinking about for today it's got life in it but it has no purpose except to be cut down are the big are they're not going to be harvested they're going to be cut down and burned but but what we planted a month or so ago corn dori up this high all the different things are already up might get some squash in the next week or two but praise the Lord thousand level the heels if you have we got a giveaway of one jubilee situation we have listen real well you can have planning but the situation we had was is my mother through some through some swine up in the garden last year and it went to see well when it come out we come up like a bush so I took of them and replanted them in different places so we come up with fifty and we'd already bought 20 plants and leasing them plants them out of seeds so we got I do believe the church nearby but back to my point speed was planted I know that I'm the store of the sea now I'm not the son of man but the Sun man is the one who sowed the seed there he knew I know what's in every one of those roads but I planted it the Bible tells us that revelation 10 7 that we're going there's going to be a voice of the seventh angel messenger that's going to bring us to fruition not the two shoots not the stock we've got corn up some up about this high every year corn is in that life is in it but it's not the corner it's not to see we've got to get back to see right the Bible says the corn of wheat falls in the ground it and died to divide alone but when it comes up it brings forth what much fruit so you're now coming to a place excuse me that I don't want everybody to understand boom it's wonderful to receive the baptism of the holy cultures wonderful to be baptized it's wonderful to do all these things wonderful to listen to tapes and all these different things but if you're not born again your wheat see your covers you're going to be cut down you may look good you may look nicely I'm telling you like right now in our garden you have to be careful because as Jim we were looking at yesterday the corn and grass yet this high looks exactly the same all you have to look to the characteristics or the characteristics of corn is it rolls the leaves role when grass starts growing the leaves are like like this so if you see it rolling that's the corn see then you pull around it well that's what God is doing now he's he knows whose seed but we don't yet but when all the weeds get pulled out of the lake you can see the big rows of corn and all you see is corn well that's what God's done he says I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire that down that's be rich and white ran a paper when we get done in about two months from now we're gonna have a lot of corn and we're gonna have a lot of bean who's gonna have a lot of squash zucchini matters and diet not taters but matter hey yeah we're not a lot of tomatoes do but uh but you see that's potential look look all this is potential it was corn seed right here it was corn seed and every one of these but it only got to a certain place that God said Lane I'm but I'm happy if them two ships don't ever get out of the ground you get no crop so the two shoots had to come out of the ground under lugar real simple two shoots coming up like this Wesley the stock starts growing Pentecost is the husk that looks kind of like the wheat but right inside of it it's where the life is that's the life that come from what seed to here and that's okay to have to be shuk - shuk protects to see but remember everything at the end of our process of crop gathering basically with wheat no we don't have we plan but we have other things we like to gather when they're alive but if we will wheat farmers you have to wait to that link completely dies it the most deadlight right now it looks the most dead has ever been but inside of the letter that one week that's got all the life in it now all the life and energy of that plant has went into that seat not that we don't need it but we don't need this anymore you know why we have the life we don't have the stock in this know we needed it then get don't get me wrong we need all that that's true that's why I'm talking about upstairs a journey of a believer you've got to have that journey to choose the journey of the stock the journey of them of the husk that comes out but inside that did you the journey of a believer and thank God that we can look at a simple plant and see your journey in life at the christian the life in the sea it dies okay the seed actually dies what it does is it fuel that you read in biology or none of those things look the Steve actually month up with water and swells when it cracks open that releases the life okay so Jesus Christ had to be the corn of wheat that went in the ground they died soaked up the water he was worth and then when he come forth on they Pentecost that was the life came back into the believer so then he can have a more of a crop that's William bleed boy so rather round they come to bring us a new way to get born again one of the things this is this endtime messenger down over here didn't come to bring us anything different anything that's not in the Bible he couldn't have can't be a word prophet and and bring something different but he did bring us what he brought us took complete love letter not just pieces and parts of it pieces and parts of it are okay he restored yeah well now hold on but he restored but that's not all he restored us back to what what about his women in Lord Jesus Christ no eternal hell the way we dress and act the vacation on steroids is what I call it thank you Jason on steroids go thank you patient back in either even in even in well even in Pentecost when Pentecost first started coming in mm-hmm they had short hair that they started wearing pants and different things on end of their journey but God had sent a property to write ever build that right righ T to make it right all right he brought it in other words he brought the plant back to cleaned all the leaves out from around it but now that's okay because you've got a plan but where's your harvest the property God was not sent to bring us a new Newberg he said he was sent to bring us a new birth from according to Malachi 4 which meant that it wasn't a new new birth different from the rest of these but it took you on to profession of a statue of a perfect man this was never taught me ages not sure it was taught here because Peter wrote about it but remember it went away one week died when the ground and not see of the Dark Ages they come back to shoot Dolph tassel then we got over here where we are is the full ear of corn just like the season was breaking it's not just that corn that you can eat you got to wait for it to your heart right and they make it planted need to replant it so that's what we're doing is we're going through maybe as the world may see of the drying time for Christianity I and I want to say again I'm glad that at least President Trump have enough gumption about itself to walk out there and tell everybody and y'all get out of an abortion clinics and if y'all can have your liquor stores open city you need to open churches well he said places of worship so thank God for that that he's at least got some sense about him to do that but do I guess this weekend based on until we're at listen we're ok we're done we're done we're fine we're doing but what I'm saying is the world they look at said well this is the dark time but to me I think about this yesterday this time now it's the time I told you about of a revival you're you were thinking that it was your fill the church's double he's gonna have a choir and we were gonna have you know we won't have shouting speaking in tongues that's not why he's preaching a revival is what I say an individual revival stone are gonna set up there some are never going to come back to church and I don't mean just our church would say some people that's never gonna come back this always happens but there'll be a group and there's my lesson there and just for example nailing and that there have been baptized and they come into the Christian faith they come closer to God that's a republic but it's individual because it may not catch on to mere or somebody but somebody is going to catch this thing and keep on going some are gonna say well I think I can sit at home or I think all I got to do to bleed brother around the property so you can believe brother around the problem he knows he is because he knows that there's only one God but what does he teach us a Trinity Satan literally no there's only one person he talked to one not a Jesus over here Holy Ghost no over here no the devil no there's one done and he talks to him all the time but he turns and gives us a three guy concept a father-son in the whole laughs one of that's deceiving that's the deceiving part your you know the deceiving part is is to walk down the street with not a stick to clothes on and think you're fully dressed that's what the world thinks that's what even the nominations and and you say well and I ain't talked about dress what you got on I'm talking about your religion because the Bible tells us when you look up that word religion it means covering and that's that only they did they didn't go back to God with no clothes on they talked to God no clothing on forever but something happened in their mind and in their consciousness that made them aware that they were naked still they wouldn't make big leagues which is a covering which is the rule they created a religion in the Garden of Eden and that's what you say well are you a Christian brother have many Tony's and you ask the are you Christian I'm bad at it that's the covering that's a religion that immaculate I'm paying off I'm brown line I gonna lose that's a religious covering we need to break out of that and by this goal the Word of God let down Lance be rich and white raiment what purity live a Pure Life get the baptism of the Holy Ghost and then go on that down max be clothed in other words if you're naked and realize it that's okay even if you literally were naked new anointing and you got this revelation that you were and then you went put on clothes what greater revelation would there be same thing with the Bible same thing with the prophets message hmm even walking around naked for years wipe the ground probably disparities no travel products prevent problem I have preacher say one time he was a messy parakeet at the whole board gun don't want a parakeet let me finish my point I don't want a parakeet he want what sons and daughters who died he want somebody that's what white raiment that thou mayst be clothed and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear and anoint thine eyes with eyesalve that thou may see right what was it they wanted that my let me go purchase what is the purchase Bridget possession how are you gonna get clear how you gonna get go you don't abide by what living it you're gonna buy it by what purchasing coming to church and living the right line and we can lift upward if you want to strong and it says to purchase to rename fire sale all right so you went out and you bought it by the washing of the water the word how do you find go yeah not exactly wash you do not wash it with water you send this big strand of water down through this they used to cut the mountains into Lanka that's why you go up that long highway in Dahlonega a long time ago I remember when I first started working at James II in 1987 you could see a cut and that cut before they got on top of the mountain was a big ol jet of water and they just let the water go all the way down what happened was all the all the trash and all the mud went down to the bottom of the mountain and the gold is so much heavy it stays there so there was just this that's the same thing with washing ago are the work most of you gold is found in what creeks and rivers water it's always water associated we go so here that little gold nugget you got to be watched by the water the work you're always tell me it's there just got uncovered as many as I love I rebuke and chasten be zealous therefore and repent see still there is a way out you can repent behold that stands the door enough remember he's been put out of the church by the denominations by your mind your ideas and my ideas but all you gotta do to go door open or late a minute alright let it make you heart they made of the everyday life if any man hear my voice and open the door I will come in and we'll stop look he'll be in the know it don't be the darkest time that would be the most deceiving time this is the most intimate time God comes to us brother the most intimate everything else if you'll notice it says you'll get a new heart and you'll get in you'll get these different things I'm gonna come in and talk please debate and then if you overcome you're gonna sit with me in not on in my throne it's not you say but so I don't want Jesus beside me Satan has Jesus presiding hopefully I'm on time but there's no way that Jesus can get inside Satan does the door he turned him down but there's the way Jesus get inside of you and say that that's why I said the intimacy in this last days being the darkest days but if you'll overcome if you'll keep going keep keep asking God to give you a revelation he's going to grant to sit with me on my throne even as I overcome and I'm sitting there with my father in his throne because you know what he said I my father a warrant hmm brother Brown says when the bride excuse me begins to say I have my father what how could we do that because we're with him in his throne and then he sat down in the Father's throne we what we're one go go they'll be increasing upstairs that's what will happen is people can't swallow this people can't take that you are Jesus Christ in another form on the earth called a bride not another person the same person but not just the new birth but by the new birth plus all these and that the headstone is when you realize that what the headstone was who that son man not the son of God son of god was a spirit god it was the Holy Ghost that comes into you but when you come into you to do chained to you into God in human flesh called bride see some people change their head go there's no way you do that well that's the shuck the ship's going to dry up it's going to look like it it's a linen look it's a 50 covers listen if if we would have had justification sanctification and then brother Brown was just come on the same with the power rationing had people wouldn't take it but God sent the holy ghost number day of Pentecost live the gifts of healing and comes and interpretation and trying to live right and doing the right thing and then God sent a prophet to step on this thing say hey you Pentecostals you're great I'm with you but you stop you stop we're going forward you stop you said tones of the elements and that's all it is that I can't go no further um does the ever that stuff and you remember that hmm I said my message that's two parts one like you said to restore back but the second part is to reveal those seven thunders or the seven seals that will change your body you've already been changed on the inside mmm 9/11 to the Waterside being she she physically gotta watch him but now God's gonna have to do a spiritual washing by the water of the word to let that go come out and let us be changed in this thing i baptize a lot of older people and they came back the older people but because it's not the time yet it's the beginning of the journey but if you walk on in newness of life as I was we were reading the scripture you walk in newness of life and God's gonna give you the holy oath plus I like that Holy Ghost plus cuz it's still the Holy Ghost but listen did they take did this church is how this muffle unfolding the discharge have the Holy Ghost just say yes it is mr. takes have the Holy Ghost the dish I'm holding up didn't know did not pull them you know all those fell on these people doesn't matter you you call them false if you won't do but they were true believers the Holy Ghost fell on what they had what the head was evidences of speaking in tongues and hey it's Bible can take it out and gift of healing but when they say this is it there's no more we're done pronounce it no you just get started and this ain't your requirement is like I said animal see the holy ghost but who took a body tan who is the alive and remain no one none of these people are alive and remain there all in the grave window menu to come to a place right here of saddling completion then step over into the eighth day the baptism of the Holy Ghost plus the change of this body the change of this body is going to be because of the washing of the war of the work you're going to realize there naked you've got to realize you need more and you're going to realize you need more than what mom and daddy says hey you know it's okay brother around the property you just believe that that's nonsense that's nonsense you got to know Jesus Christ first repent and be baptized you can't repent your brother branham you can't repent because of brother Brennan like Aaron preacher wins tonight this is your job you take you back to Calvary you take everything back to Jesus Christ and then you come and say okay night Jesus they died on the cross right here he's now inside of me in the fullness now we've got more word we've got all the word we've got the mystery of God is being finished which is what is the great mystery according to Colossians 1 it says the mystery is Christ in you so we'll start with chapter 4 because look and after this and after all the church ages well Graham said there's when we take the rapture the door was open in heaven and I always come and I was taken up come up Hilary so the rapture takes place in our time I believe we'll be able to see it let's go come only though [Music] I'm good [Music] hey Joe
