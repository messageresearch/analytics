[0:00] for the philippines
[0:01] um i know i think we told you already
[0:04] that
[0:04] the church itself is going to
[0:07] uh send the three thousand dollars to
[0:09] the dingalon church to finish the church
[0:13] and the pastor's study so that has been
[0:15] taken care of by the church
[0:17] and also brother edward
[0:20] uh needed the sound system and i was
[0:23] given 75 by two people
[0:26] here in the congregation to take care of
[0:28] that so that needs been taken care of
[0:30] and then we have
[0:31] uh others that have
[0:33] that have come forward and
[0:36] given money are going to give money uh
[0:39] upwards of two thousand dollars
[0:41] to finish brother edwards church so we
[0:43] thank god for that
[0:45] and then we are we are looking now
[0:48] to
[0:49] uh
[0:50] some of you that want to help if you
[0:53] want to do it individually they need
[0:54] tablets
[0:55] those tablets are 50 bucks a piece and
[0:58] they're
[0:58] uh and all they're using it for is the
[1:01] message they they don't get on the
[1:02] internet because there's not a lot of
[1:04] internet service in
[1:06] uh especially in palowan where they're
[1:08] they're looking at taking these tablets
[1:09] but they're 50 bucks a piece
[1:12] with the message installed by one of the
[1:14] brothers that brother uh soriano's
[1:17] church they install the message and then
[1:19] they take it to palowan
[1:21] they're having a hard time getting books
[1:23] like i told you about the church age
[1:25] books they're having a hard time voice
[1:26] of god is having a hard time but hey if
[1:28] you can get them a tablet for 50 bucks
[1:30] they've got the whole message
[1:32] they can research the whole message and
[1:34] they've always got it with them
[1:37] most people have power so you don't have
[1:39] to worry about that they can you know
[1:40] they can
[1:41] use their battery chargers and all that
[1:43] you know charge your battery so 50 bucks
[1:46] if anybody'd like to help i'd like to
[1:48] see if we can maybe get 10
[1:50] to send over there because those 15
[1:52] people that called brother letho the
[1:55] other time when we were there
[1:57] that was 15 out of the 60
[2:00] wants him to come back and teach in
[2:02] their church
[2:03] we had nothing to give them so we need
[2:05] 10 or 15 of those tablets
[2:08] that we can send them the money and let
[2:10] them buy the tablets and take them to
[2:13] plowing and give them so if you if you
[2:16] want to do that i think the church has
[2:17] done enough itself
[2:19] and maybe individually because june and
[2:21] i are going to help some too
[2:23] but if anybody would like to do that
[2:25] that would be a blessing for them we're
[2:27] like i said we're uh we're a giving
[2:30] church and and it's all yours anyway and
[2:32] you know it's what you give
[2:34] but i would like to uh
[2:37] to extend that if anybody would like to
[2:38] help mom
[2:42] that's going over there
[2:46] yes we're going to send brother lito
[2:48] we're going
[2:48] the church itself
[2:50] like we support the people some of the
[2:52] people in the philippines to do their
[2:54] extended work we're also sending another
[2:58] amount of money for that brother lito
[2:59] that i told you that went over to
[3:01] palawan and stayed three months
[3:03] uh we're extending some money to him
[3:06] every month to pay for his expenses
[3:08] because like i said it does take money
[3:11] to operate whether whether it's over
[3:13] there over here it still takes some
[3:14] money so we're as a church we're
[3:17] committed to forward him
[3:19] some more money
[3:20] for a monthly support for him to go do
[3:23] his work in palaum because like i said
[3:24] his work just now has begun
[3:27] uh to take to go to 15 churches
[3:30] and to bring them the message of the
[3:31] hour
[3:32] that would be a full-time job
[3:34] so for the next three months or whatever
[3:36] time he when he gets over there he will
[3:38] have several months of nothing but just
[3:41] going around preaching to these brand
[3:42] new churches that's never heard the
[3:44] message of the hour and it would be
[3:46] wonderful for him to take a tablet and
[3:48] hand them to the pastor and say here
[3:50] this is the whole message research all
[3:52] you want to research but this is what
[3:54] this is for so if anybody wants to do
[3:56] that
[3:57] see me come and talk to me don't go
[3:59] anywhere else just come see me that way
[4:00] i'll handle it from the end here since
[4:03] the lease is not here uh we can run it
[4:05] through the church if you wish or you
[4:06] can give me cash it doesn't matter but
[4:08] if you want to do that just come and see
[4:10] me after the service or wednesday or
[4:12] next sunday we don't have to do it this
[4:14] sunday there's not a deadline i would
[4:16] just like to get it there as fast as we
[4:18] can so so god bless you thank you for
[4:20] what you've already done
[4:22] and uh
[4:23] and what god's gonna do because this
[4:25] continued support i believe there's a
[4:27] work over there that needs to be done
[4:29] there's a work everywhere but like i
[4:30] told the brothers i sent him an email
[4:33] brother gary we can't support all of the
[4:36] philippines but but when you present a
[4:38] need to a church you let the holy spirit
[4:40] tell you what to do
[4:41] you know let the holy ghost tell you
[4:42] what to do they may be
[4:44] you know they may think that this need
[4:45] needs to be taken care of first
[4:48] but when god puts it on your heart to
[4:50] say here here's 50 i want this to go to
[4:53] this brother edward or i want this to go
[4:55] to brother leto then you i believe then
[4:57] it's the lord leading you to do it and
[5:00] then if the lord wants to have another
[5:01] need met by another church let them take
[5:03] care of that
[5:05] don't lay the burden on one church but
[5:06] let the holy spirit say okay i believe
[5:08] this brother can use this amount of
[5:10] money and you're the one that's going to
[5:11] give it and then i'll take care of all
[5:14] the needs
[5:15] god's going to take care of the needs
[5:16] anyway
[5:18] right but we just don't all take care of
[5:20] it in as one church body as spoken word
[5:23] church let the whole world pitch in
[5:26] and do but the lord's laid it on a lot
[5:28] of your hearts to to give me money and
[5:29] say here put this toward this or or i
[5:31] don't care what it goes toward here take
[5:33] this and give it so then we will direct
[5:35] it to the place that it needs to go but
[5:37] right now i believe we need to to see
[5:40] about getting some tablets so that they
[5:42] can get the pure message you know at
[5:43] least get it on on
[5:45] uh don't have to be audio at least you
[5:47] can get where they can read it where
[5:48] they can see the message of the hour
[5:50] because these are brand new people brand
[5:52] new churches that could come to the
[5:54] message of the hour by that
[5:56] just giving them that tablet and giving
[5:58] them information hey information
[6:00] this is the information age
[6:02] the more information you got the better
[6:04] off you are so god bless you

[25:36] opportunity
[25:37] to be able to just think about the
[25:39] things that we've just spoke about that
[25:42] we would be people that the ends of all
[25:44] things would come upon us
[25:46] and that we would be happy about that
[25:49] not to see
[25:50] the bad part
[25:52] but we know that we'll go along with it
[25:54] and be there and we can't help that lord
[25:57] but to be able to see the end of all
[25:59] things to be brought upon mankind
[26:04] and then ending that up we know that
[26:06] eternity begins where we are ending our
[26:09] parts and lord we love you and we thank
[26:11] you have your way remember the sick
[26:13] among us the different ones request
[26:16] and father just let your love be made
[26:18] manifest in each one
[26:21] in jesus name
[26:22] amen
[26:24] all right
[26:26] i don't know whether they kept on going
[26:27] but we don't have to but we we just gave
[26:30] the
[26:31] yeah they went on down okay so i didn't
[26:33] know where i gave them that note i've
[26:35] written it so many times revelation 1 12
[26:37] 13. but they get ahead of me and they
[26:39] pick it on up okay
[26:40] and i turned to see the voice that spake
[26:42] with me and being turned i saw seven
[26:44] golden candles too
[26:46] in the midst of the seven candlesticks
[26:48] one like unto the son of man clove of
[26:50] the garment down to the foot and gird
[26:52] about to pouch with a golden girdle his
[26:54] head and his hairs were white like wool
[26:57] as white as snow
[26:59] and his eyes were as a flame of fire
[27:01] and his feet likened to find bryce as if
[27:04] they burned in a furnace and his voice
[27:06] has the sound of many
[27:08] waters
[27:09] and he had in his right hand seven stars
[27:12] and out of his mouth when a sharp
[27:14] two-edged sword
[27:15] and his countenance was as the sun
[27:18] shineth in his strength and when i saw
[27:21] him i fell at his feet as dead
[27:23] and he laid his right hand upon me
[27:25] saying unto me fear not i am the first
[27:29] and the last
[27:30] i am he that liveth
[27:32] and was dead and behold i am alive
[27:34] forevermore amen and have the keys
[27:38] of hell and death now let's go to
[27:41] ii corinthians
[27:45] 5.
[27:49] we read
[27:51] start 4 14 for the love of christ can
[27:53] train us us because we just judge that
[27:56] if one died for all then all then we're
[27:58] all dead
[27:59] and that he died for all that they which
[28:02] lived should not henceforth live unto
[28:04] themselves
[28:06] but unto him which died for them and
[28:08] rose again
[28:09] wherefore henceforth no no we no man
[28:13] after the flesh
[28:14] yea though we have known christ after
[28:16] the flesh yet now henceforth know we
[28:20] him no more what after the flesh it's in
[28:22] the spirit right
[28:23] therefore if any man be in christ he is
[28:25] a new creature old things are passed
[28:28] away behold all things are become
[28:30] new
[28:31] and all things are of god who has
[28:33] reconciled us to himself
[28:36] by jesus christ
[28:38] and have given to us
[28:40] the ministry of reconciliation now the
[28:43] ministry of reconciliation
[28:45] is actually the atonement
[28:48] see we think about reconciling
[28:51] part
[28:52] but really in in what it's bringing out
[28:54] here
[28:55] it's the the ministry of the atonement
[28:59] because in the atonement is only the
[29:01] reconciliation
[29:03] see we're thinking it's like
[29:04] reconciliation to restore something to
[29:06] bring it back it's really the atonement
[29:08] is the main point that's what i'm
[29:11] reading it about where you can see
[29:13] how he died and what he done
[29:16] and how we look no more after the flesh
[29:19] see
[29:20] but we look and we talk about a new
[29:22] creation or a new creature
[29:24] old things are passed away then see all
[29:26] things are of god who hath reconciled us
[29:28] to himself by jesus christ and has given
[29:31] to us
[29:33] the ministry of reconciliation
[29:36] but wait a minute he's given to us
[29:38] why would you be talking about it be an
[29:40] atonement
[29:42] because see we are the ones who know
[29:44] what the real atonement is
[29:46] right okay
[29:48] now watch to it
[29:50] what is that to understand
[29:53] what is the ministry of reconciliation
[29:55] to understand that god was in christ
[29:59] reconciling the world unto himself
[30:02] not imputing their transgressions into
[30:04] them and have committed to us
[30:07] the word of
[30:08] reconciliation amen you may be seated
[30:11] the lord add his blessing
[30:12] to the reading of the word see just to
[30:15] get you to a point of thinking
[30:19] you know
[30:23] we talked about the atonement
[30:26] we we you know we went through those
[30:28] things and we believed in the blood of
[30:30] jesus christ and the life given
[30:33] for us
[30:34] but see when this message came
[30:37] we come to a point then of really seeing
[30:40] things in an open view
[30:42] that was never seen before
[30:45] by way of this end time message
[30:48] all right and to think that you and i
[30:51] understand that's what it means are too
[30:54] wet to understand
[30:57] that
[30:59] we understand the reconciliation
[31:03] as nobody has ever understood it
[31:06] we will get to that more the lord
[31:08] willing next week
[31:09] and talk about some things but i just
[31:12] want your mind to just think on that
[31:16] that we do have a part to do
[31:19] in this end time
[31:21] and as we read there and we don't throw
[31:23] no reflection to the point but it's the
[31:25] truth
[31:26] that the it's the bride of jesus christ
[31:31] that has the ministry of reconciliation
[31:35] all right now i am not saying period not
[31:38] saying now that nobody else can't be
[31:41] saved out in organized religion et
[31:43] cetera you know and and be really truly
[31:46] born again i have no reflection to that
[31:49] whatsoever
[31:50] but i believe it's getting pretty narrow
[31:54] now i said pretty narrow that could mean
[31:56] a great big wide view
[31:57] in a world of 7 billion people for the
[31:59] narrow could be a billion
[32:02] right
[32:03] so you understand what i'm getting at
[32:05] i'm not making any point other than see
[32:08] i believe now i do believe this
[32:12] i believe there'll be a time right when
[32:14] it winds up in the finishing up of all
[32:17] things
[32:18] that
[32:19] if you're going to get anything you're
[32:21] going to
[32:22] find the bride of christ
[32:25] to receive from
[32:27] i believe that that's that's as honest
[32:29] as i can say it because that's a that's
[32:31] how i believe how close that the bride
[32:33] will be to jesus christ
[32:36] that it's going to come to a place that
[32:38] the gates are going to be closed
[32:40] everything's going to be finished
[32:42] and you're going to have to
[32:45] uh
[32:47] rely on each other
[32:49] you know to be able to
[32:51] follow through and finish it up well
[32:54] brother dale i'll just do it on my own
[32:57] okay all right
[32:59] let me argue with you about it
[33:01] i just don't believe it
[33:04] is that all right i just don't believe
[33:06] it because i believe that it's the body
[33:08] of christ
[33:10] and being the body of christ
[33:13] if we believe the words of the prophet
[33:15] in the way that he brought it and the
[33:17] things that are in the bible
[33:19] remember that the seed comes through the
[33:22] body all right
[33:25] and there'll come a time that will only
[33:26] be the redemptive plan will be within
[33:29] the
[33:30] they i call it framework where it won't
[33:33] be in the wrong thing but within the
[33:34] ranks of the bride of jesus christ
[33:37] and i believe that that's what i've
[33:38] always believed always believe and look
[33:40] at that time
[33:41] and not look to where you just say
[33:43] you know because you think we're i'm
[33:45] saying we're it
[33:48] i thought we was here
[33:51] that's what i thought was the truth
[33:53] i thought the bride is it
[33:56] i didn't know there was any
[33:58] things left over
[34:00] and that's not making no light against
[34:02] nobody
[34:04] everybody has had their day and their
[34:06] time and their beings
[34:07] which is in our time
[34:10] and we come down to how the ministry of
[34:12] reconciliation the the ministry of
[34:15] explaining the atonement
[34:19] or are you with me about that i you know
[34:21] i just i thought well lord do we
[34:23] understand
[34:24] what that's saying this reconciliation
[34:27] will means to restore you see that's
[34:29] what we think look it up
[34:33] i had took that opportunity it means the
[34:35] atonement
[34:38] which would be the reconciliation
[34:41] it's for you to be able to explain the
[34:42] true atonement
[34:45] you know now god winks in our ignorance
[34:47] is that scripture
[34:49] but what's the rest of that scripture
[34:53] that god winks at her ignorance that's
[34:55] fine and he did
[34:57] but what's the rest of that verse
[35:00] which said now he commands all man to
[35:01] repent
[35:02] see in other words you're going to have
[35:03] to come to that place
[35:05] all right so then people out there if
[35:07] you hear that and say you think that we
[35:09] got to come to you to get it
[35:11] i didn't say me i didn't say it that way
[35:13] i didn't say us i said the bride of
[35:15] christ
[35:16] okay everybody follow me so we know then
[35:19] where we're going all right
[35:22] now
[35:24] i brought the message this morning up to
[35:26] a point
[35:28] because i wanted you to
[35:31] get your mind in a
[35:33] set form of thinking about
[35:37] uh
[35:38] the point of what i was trying to
[35:39] explain
[35:41] all right we'll try to continue that
[35:43] thought on this afternoon
[35:46] and then we will drop back the lord
[35:48] willing to be more in the redemptive
[35:51] form
[35:53] of bringing it the lord willing next
[35:55] weekend all right
[35:58] now what was our thought this morning
[36:01] that had they known that this was the
[36:03] lord of glory
[36:06] they would have not killed him
[36:09] we know that's true
[36:11] so they didn't believe
[36:14] even who he said he was
[36:18] right
[36:20] even when he said it and even when signs
[36:22] and wonders
[36:23] prove the point
[36:25] of who he was
[36:28] they did not believe it why
[36:30] because they had previously been
[36:35] perverted in their thinking
[36:37] and it had happened as it did in the
[36:39] garden
[36:41] that satan through his septility
[36:44] had blinded those people's eyes
[36:47] and remember it was not the sinner that
[36:50] had jesus had trouble with
[36:53] it was not the uh prostitutes
[36:57] of the things right
[37:00] you know that's what they got onto
[37:01] anybody eating with sinners and
[37:03] it was not those things that was the
[37:05] problem
[37:07] where was the problem in his day
[37:10] the religious leaders of that day were
[37:13] the ones who
[37:15] instigated the form to word that it
[37:18] would bring him finally to his
[37:20] crucifixion all right because they were
[37:23] the only ones that had the power enough
[37:24] to do those things you know
[37:27] and in doing it then
[37:30] who would we always look to be the ones
[37:32] that was deceived
[37:35] we look back at eve we've been through
[37:37] that part to see that she was deceived
[37:42] that she was not wanting to be a bad
[37:44] woman she was not doing these things she
[37:46] was deceived into the point that she
[37:48] thought she was right
[37:50] right
[37:51] all right
[37:52] brother brown said it's hard to get
[37:54] those pharisees i believe it's birth
[37:56] pains
[37:56] i believe it but then they said like
[37:58] this he said hard to get those pharisees
[38:00] and things to realize they were sinners
[38:03] to where he could die for him
[38:06] you realize his death never helped
[38:07] anybody that doesn't get saved
[38:11] right
[38:12] so it wasn't you know i mean that back
[38:14] there see
[38:16] they didn't believe it why
[38:20] i mean
[38:22] everybody no matter what surely the the
[38:26] word got out the uh the things at least
[38:29] around in some respects
[38:31] of a man that could raise the dead
[38:35] on many occasions
[38:38] he could heal the sick
[38:41] he could teach you how to pay taxes
[38:44] right you do many marvelous things
[38:48] then you want to kill him
[38:51] now you take the bible sometimes and sit
[38:53] down and think about it upon what
[38:56] grounds
[38:57] would you ever think about them coming
[39:00] to a point of crucifying this man
[39:05] he never done nothing but good
[39:10] even what they thought was bad
[39:13] or maybe driving them out of the temple
[39:15] the statements he'd make about them and
[39:16] things you know what they had to admit
[39:19] he was right
[39:22] i mean why didn't they come back there
[39:24] when he drove them out of the temple why
[39:26] didn't they go get the temple guards
[39:29] and come back and run him out
[39:33] you know you don't let that go through
[39:34] your cranium cap you know and consider
[39:37] it a little
[39:39] they knew he was right
[39:42] and they knew they were wrong
[39:48] but see a man that never done nothing
[39:49] but good i used to think that when i was
[39:51] in a baptist i used to
[39:53] i pondered those thoughts i thought well
[39:55] and that's something that that you just
[39:57] do good and you heal the sick you raise
[39:59] the debt you do everything in the world
[40:00] and they want to kill you
[40:03] now that's what i call being blind
[40:07] right
[40:08] that's what i call being deceived right
[40:11] got a lot of other words i could call it
[40:13] like ignorant and stupid but we don't
[40:15] like to do that that much we just put it
[40:17] on the basis of what they were
[40:21] and somebody blinded them
[40:27] right
[40:31] i mean come on the poor average guy
[40:35] you don't ever think about
[40:37] when they were stirring up the crowds to
[40:40] get them to call for the the killings
[40:42] and the crucifixions and things
[40:45] you don't think about a lot of those
[40:46] people were good honest sincere people
[40:52] a lot of those people were coming o joes
[40:54] and
[40:55] you know
[40:57] just plain people
[41:01] and they were maybe not as deceived
[41:05] as much as we would think they were just
[41:07] caught up in the crowd
[41:09] because the people that were supposed to
[41:11] know
[41:14] about who would
[41:15] uh be the wrong guy
[41:18] is the ones that they had depended upon
[41:20] all of their life
[41:24] real nice people
[41:28] right
[41:29] now bring that on down to our day for a
[41:32] little while and just think about
[41:37] it's not the methodists and the baptists
[41:38] and the presbyterians the pentecostals
[41:41] et cetera
[41:42] that bothers you or not right
[41:44] if it does you you've got to really a
[41:46] problem i mean if you think well i need
[41:49] to go back down there to that because
[41:50] they're better people you might as well
[41:52] just going back down into that because
[41:53] you're you're not seeing the truth you
[41:56] know by talking about somebody being
[41:58] good
[41:59] you know we're not talking about that
[42:01] we're talking about truth
[42:03] of the word of god all right
[42:06] see then
[42:08] in doing that who do you think is the
[42:10] problems today that's why you see that i
[42:11] spend so much time speaking against the
[42:15] doctrinal issues etc of the people of
[42:18] this message
[42:20] who do you think is going to deceive us
[42:24] i mean you're going to turn on a radio
[42:26] broadcast of
[42:28] anybody you know
[42:30] and and you go
[42:32] well you know what
[42:33] he explained the trinity's so good i
[42:35] just about see it
[42:41] why
[42:44] okay
[42:46] you get the point
[42:51] i think about that a lot folks i'm sorry
[42:53] i'm just human i'm sorry
[42:57] i i think about the ministers of this
[42:59] message that are so wonderful in their
[43:01] ways and they're talking i'm not making
[43:03] no joke or a lot either
[43:05] and they're so you know
[43:07] eloquent in their speeches until they
[43:09] can just uh have you on the edge of your
[43:11] seat thinking about these things and
[43:13] just get the whole crowd up into
[43:15] a frenzy you know of doing
[43:18] we were a certain meeting one time and
[43:20] and this brother was explaining the
[43:22] point and
[43:23] everybody in the building was just
[43:25] elated and just
[43:27] up
[43:28] but one row
[43:30] and i looked down through there
[43:33] we don't go on if it wasn't all lula
[43:35] heights
[43:38] and you know they were just sitting
[43:39] there
[43:42] just not doing nothing
[43:45] well you know we stood out yeah
[43:48] you know
[43:51] but uh
[43:53] they wasn't deceived by the person but
[43:56] everybody else in the building out of 3
[43:57] 400
[43:58] 500
[44:00] was just elated to the things that was
[44:02] being said
[44:04] and and you know
[44:07] maybe that's me i don't know
[44:10] but i i wasn't doing a
[44:12] hey hey hey he's wrong hey hey hey yo
[44:15] sat down he's wrong
[44:18] i was sitting drawn up on the other side
[44:20] trying to not be a spectacle
[44:24] i tried to do that one time and this
[44:25] brother he was going to fix it real good
[44:26] for me
[44:28] and we were in this meeting and this
[44:29] brother was kind of
[44:31] we knew that he would more basically
[44:33] come out with a
[44:34] thought and i don't remember who it was
[44:37] if i never figure it out i'm going to
[44:38] fix them
[44:40] but somebody in our group took my seat
[44:42] and said it out in the aisle
[44:44] well here's a line up of chairs
[44:48] and i'm sitting right out in the aisle
[44:54] and what am i going to do i i can't get
[44:56] up and move
[44:58] but i'm sitting there just drawn up not
[45:00] trying not to be sarcastic or you know
[45:03] i'm trying to be nice and amen and what
[45:05] i can you know
[45:07] but
[45:11] i give god the credit for it
[45:14] if there's any truth in any of us
[45:18] it is not me and you
[45:21] we didn't search for it we didn't want
[45:23] it
[45:24] we didn't try to find it
[45:26] we're kind of like it was in the bible
[45:28] of those seemingly to be the outcast
[45:31] were the ones who would receive the
[45:33] truth
[45:36] but see in the end time you see a lot of
[45:38] people
[45:39] leading the people astray
[45:42] and i'm sorry i'm
[45:43] honest
[45:48] but maybe god will look at that in a
[45:49] different way
[45:51] when we get there
[45:53] and uh
[45:55] but i know the ones who know that's the
[45:57] way
[45:58] you know the ones who know the truth are
[46:00] going to be the problem if it's me or
[46:02] whoever it be
[46:04] but i'm trying to get you to a point of
[46:06] thinking
[46:09] get out of your previous thinking of
[46:11] things and how you had it all figured
[46:14] out
[46:16] to get into the real things of listening
[46:19] to the bible
[46:22] as it's written
[46:25] and the prophet's message
[46:26] as you know
[46:29] it's
[46:29] written to where that we can
[46:32] get a better understanding and see
[46:34] ourselves because what good it is to see
[46:36] somebody else
[46:39] good or bad
[46:41] you know i mean that's wonderful seeing
[46:43] somebody good right
[46:45] well what is the point of good or bad if
[46:47] it's not but just that's that's all we
[46:49] see
[46:52] we get it to the point of seeing christ
[46:57] and then we can glory in
[46:59] the fact of what we see
[47:01] all right
[47:03] trying this morning to get us to a
[47:05] thought
[47:07] about
[47:09] god
[47:11] and how real is your god
[47:13] i'm still on that point
[47:16] of thinking about
[47:19] how that the bible says even the eternal
[47:21] godhead can be understood by the things
[47:24] that we see
[47:28] you know
[47:29] to look around and understand
[47:32] the things and understand god
[47:35] the great eternal one that you know
[47:37] yourself that when you first started
[47:40] before you heard of this message
[47:42] your idea of god was some spirit form or
[47:46] some uh angelic type of being or some um
[47:51] supernatural
[47:52] thing
[47:53] that would never in any way be able to
[47:55] be comprehended by mankind
[48:00] well that's going to be an eternity
[48:02] wouldn't it
[48:04] of trying to figure him out
[48:07] no i want to know a little bit about him
[48:08] when i get there
[48:10] then there's going to be a whole lot
[48:11] when i get there that i won't have
[48:13] figured out
[48:15] and it'll be an eternal partaking of the
[48:17] word of god because you cannot exhaust
[48:19] his word
[48:21] amen but to see it that way and
[48:23] comprehend it as as being
[48:26] seeing the truth you remember the other
[48:28] day we took that message and you shall
[48:30] know the truth
[48:32] and jesus said i'm the way the truth and
[48:34] the life
[48:37] well why didn't the people that heard
[48:38] him say that
[48:40] believe that he was the lord of glory
[48:45] they would not have killed him had they
[48:46] believed it that way but they were
[48:48] deceived by satan just like eve was
[48:51] in the garden
[48:53] and you and i can be deceived in the end
[48:55] time just like that and be justifiable
[48:59] in our own sails to think that we're
[49:01] right and we got it figured out we
[49:03] believe the prophet's message
[49:05] and everything and
[49:10] you see people used to especially is
[49:12] really was bad in the early part of the
[49:14] ministry of when i come around in the
[49:17] 67-68
[49:19] say what the prophet says
[49:22] just say what the prophet says
[49:25] well all right that's what we need to do
[49:28] and this one brother you know he was
[49:30] wanting to to do that and he was real
[49:32] bad about it and i found where brother
[49:34] branham said
[49:35] luther denominated and died
[49:40] and might have used the word went to
[49:42] hell but i know he said he denominated
[49:43] did not i said brother would you mind
[49:45] quoting now
[49:48] you're always the one that says say it
[49:50] like the prophet said it would you say
[49:51] that
[49:53] well see he knew that luther then it
[49:56] wouldn't luther denominated it was the
[49:58] people after luther that denominated and
[50:00] and and things like that well see he
[50:03] knew that he was trapped he couldn't say
[50:04] those things
[50:06] i said but that's what you want always
[50:07] to do say what the prophet says
[50:12] i said the prophet said that judas went
[50:14] and hung himself and you go do likewise
[50:19] but you see to be that away then you
[50:20] become a sarcastic hateful old dude
[50:24] well if i save your soul i don't give a
[50:26] hoot about the rest of it you think what
[50:27] you want to about me as a human being
[50:29] but there's one thing for sure you'll
[50:31] know
[50:32] you're looking at a man that believes in
[50:34] the word of god
[50:36] and in the right way
[50:38] to where that i want you to have an
[50:39] opportunity to be able to see hear it
[50:42] and and all like that all right
[50:45] but looking at it the way we were
[50:46] talking about this morning
[50:49] that god is not a trinity of beings
[50:54] now that won't work that's your trinity
[50:56] doctrine
[50:57] then
[50:58] all right but he's not a oneness
[51:01] in just holding it like your finger and
[51:02] just you know and and uh the lysine
[51:05] morphe or form of god no he's not in
[51:08] those things
[51:11] he's in there not in the middle between
[51:14] of those two points
[51:16] no he is the truth
[51:20] that is we gave this morning that god is
[51:23] not complete
[51:26] without that triune being
[51:30] all right
[51:32] see you've got to have father son and
[51:33] holy ghost
[51:35] there was a time that he was manifested
[51:37] as the father there was a time that he
[51:39] was manifested as a son there was a time
[51:41] now manifested as the holy spirit but
[51:43] it's the same god all the way through
[51:48] it's not making personalities and things
[51:50] like that we gave it this morning that
[51:52] he's not the third person he's not the
[51:54] second person he's not even the first
[51:56] person
[51:57] said because if he's the first person
[51:59] that would mean there could be two more
[52:01] and he says he is the person
[52:05] all right
[52:07] see then we set it down to understand
[52:10] and we talked about how that we first
[52:13] were made in the image of god
[52:16] all right
[52:17] but then that he came in our image
[52:21] and likeness and you know
[52:24] all right we were dealing with then
[52:27] the triune being but not a trinity of
[52:29] beings
[52:32] okay we gave a bunch of quotes but see i
[52:35] had so many i knew better than to try to
[52:37] just
[52:38] uh you know
[52:41] to uh
[52:43] bring them all this morning it would
[52:45] have still been here
[52:47] trying if i brought all that i had on it
[52:49] but
[52:50] my wife and i tell you she won't throw
[52:52] any of my notes away because
[52:54] you know there's little pieces of paper
[52:56] laying all over the desk and there's
[52:57] quotes and there's things that i run off
[53:00] that eventually i will use if i get back
[53:03] to that you know
[53:04] and uh doing it
[53:06] but
[53:08] to me i look at the whole message
[53:12] and see then
[53:14] i can see
[53:16] that and i was thinking there this
[53:18] morning about
[53:19] six o'clock when i was sitting there
[53:20] studying
[53:21] thinking about
[53:23] how wonderful
[53:25] a man
[53:27] could for 40 years
[53:30] talk about one topic
[53:37] and keep it straight
[53:43] start off in 47 talking about one god
[53:46] and wind up 65 talking about one god
[53:51] and just set them i'm amazed to
[53:54] the the just keeping it so straight
[53:58] until you can just go anywhere in the
[53:59] message and just
[54:01] you know
[54:04] and keeping it in the right order that
[54:06] had to be god
[54:07] leading the man that's just the best way
[54:10] of being all right
[54:11] but now here was our thought this
[54:13] morning
[54:15] if you're going to believe it i want to
[54:17] know any other way that you can believe
[54:19] it
[54:22] then the fact that he when he came into
[54:24] our image
[54:27] that mankind it takes
[54:29] body spirit and soul to be a man
[54:32] all right
[54:33] and if god was coming in any of those
[54:36] ways or image then he would have to come
[54:39] see
[54:40] body spirit and soul
[54:43] and that that would be the fulfillment
[54:45] of the things
[54:46] and
[54:47] watch it in a minute when we
[54:49] we break it down just to hire
[54:52] that
[54:53] he
[54:55] could not be back there in the old
[54:56] testament
[54:58] in the form of the new birth
[55:01] because in john there it says that jesus
[55:04] had not yet been glorified the holy
[55:06] ghost has not been given that's the
[55:07] bible
[55:08] but told you i'm sorry i'm sorry that i
[55:11] can read but i knew that in the baptist
[55:13] church now
[55:16] we talk to these things in the baptist
[55:18] church if that belittles you it ought to
[55:21] where was you at walmart
[55:23] no i didn't at walmart when i was back
[55:25] there
[55:29] but why didn't you read the bible
[55:35] that john being the greatest of all the
[55:37] pro but the least in the kingdom is
[55:39] greater than he
[55:42] why didn't you read
[55:45] yeah you know
[55:47] but now listen
[55:51] then to be
[55:53] the true understanding of god
[55:56] not be a oneness and not be a trinity
[55:58] what was our thought this morning i'll
[56:00] get this in then we'll move on to the
[56:02] rest part of it
[56:04] that in body
[56:08] it was a body spoken into existence
[56:11] by the word that took six thousand uh
[56:14] four thousand years to build by the
[56:17] prophets
[56:18] to bring in that that hebrews 10 5 could
[56:21] say abadi thou and brother around said
[56:23] father
[56:25] has prepared me
[56:27] that's not trinitarianism a father
[56:29] preferring a body that was simplest
[56:31] statement of saying what god created a
[56:34] body
[56:36] and then stepped into it
[56:39] he created melchizedek and stepped into
[56:41] it right
[56:43] well is there any problem to seeing that
[56:46] when he created that body that when it
[56:48] dropped from the wound of mary that he
[56:51] was right there to step into it
[56:55] if you can see that he can step into mel
[56:57] chastic as a full grown
[57:02] surely you can see that
[57:03] that baby
[57:06] to fulfill all of the scriptures
[57:10] he didn't come forth a grown man
[57:14] came forth a child
[57:16] to fulfill the bible
[57:19] but that child was who the bible said he
[57:21] was born lord to christ
[57:25] the bible said he was an emmanuel
[57:29] which by interpretation why didn't they
[57:30] call him you ever thought about that
[57:31] said you call his name emmanuel
[57:34] you know
[57:35] that used to bomb falls on me not the
[57:36] baptist i don't worry didn't you but he
[57:38] said i shall call his name emmanuelle
[57:42] well why didn't they call him emmanuel
[57:44] because the bible said call him emmanuel
[57:50] well then i finally got enough sense to
[57:51] read
[57:55] you know especially in this message
[57:58] where the prophet begin to explain
[58:01] it says emmanuel which
[58:04] by interpretation is what
[58:07] god
[58:08] with us
[58:09] right
[58:12] but of course like i said big following
[58:14] of the message now says he didn't become
[58:15] god till the river jordan well who was
[58:17] he before then oh he's just a man
[58:20] within your savior it's just a man
[58:24] and see that won't match up
[58:26] all right
[58:28] but see in body
[58:31] he came forth
[58:33] a virgin-born body
[58:36] all right
[58:37] the spirit stepped into that body and
[58:40] the soul stepped into that body
[58:43] just as when you are born
[58:45] from mama and daddy that brings the body
[58:50] all right
[58:51] a spirit comes within you
[58:55] and he breathes into your nostrils and
[58:57] you become a living soul
[59:01] a being a
[59:02] person all right i still don't we think
[59:06] that we uh are believing that soul is
[59:08] real i think we're still kind of into
[59:10] the stages of
[59:12] of uh
[59:14] some form of spirit
[59:16] part instead of the realities of what it
[59:19] really is
[59:20] but i had quoted this this morning
[59:23] and brother joe ran it off and brought
[59:25] it in there
[59:26] then the message called faith
[59:30] 1961 all right
[59:34] look what he says
[59:37] we got to use faith in god to make it
[59:38] work and all coming down or the
[59:40] resurrection it says but before he died
[59:43] he committed oh and he says uh he
[59:45] repented not in the long suffered days
[59:47] of noah his body went to the grave
[59:49] because his soul was going to hell right
[59:52] but before he died he committed his
[59:54] spirit into the hands of god
[59:56] into the hands into thy hands come in my
[1:00:00] spirit
[1:00:01] so you see his spirit went to god his
[1:00:03] soul went to hell his body went to the
[1:00:06] grave now that spirit that was in him
[1:00:09] was the spirit of god
[1:00:12] now watch him
[1:00:13] and that spirit in sondra times and
[1:00:16] divers manners anointed the prophets to
[1:00:18] bring the message to the people
[1:00:23] in the last days through christ and now
[1:00:26] in these days hear through the gospel
[1:00:30] all right
[1:00:31] so his spirit was the spirit of god who
[1:00:33] in sundry times in diverse matters
[1:00:35] spaking the prophet that's what brother
[1:00:37] brown would say he knew things
[1:00:41] because that was the spirit that was
[1:00:42] within him
[1:00:45] and then his soul coming into that would
[1:00:47] be the almighty god right
[1:00:50] the very being or person of god
[1:00:54] not a second person
[1:00:59] right
[1:01:00] god himself stepped into that body but
[1:01:02] here we go see i know our minds and
[1:01:04] that's what everything well if god got
[1:01:06] in that body
[1:01:07] and that spirit and that soul was in
[1:01:09] that body who run the world
[1:01:13] boy that's really got a
[1:01:15] masterpiece of a revelation
[1:01:19] who's handling all of this while he was
[1:01:22] in that body
[1:01:24] all they do speak it before he got
[1:01:27] that he took care of cause when he said
[1:01:28] in the beginning let it be that's it
[1:01:31] but see we think we're so smart
[1:01:34] until we show our stupidities
[1:01:37] in our thinking
[1:01:41] it didn't limit god to come into a human
[1:01:43] vessel
[1:01:45] and live
[1:01:46] that's right
[1:01:48] come on if you're that carnal about it
[1:01:49] you say well he was in the baby well how
[1:01:51] could he be at 33 years of age and it'd
[1:01:53] be in him
[1:01:54] you've got to admit some work come there
[1:01:58] even the ones with the two soul i mean
[1:01:59] the the
[1:02:01] river jordans they do admit that it
[1:02:02] comes somewhere
[1:02:05] all right
[1:02:08] well see but it's very simple
[1:02:10] a god the prophet said with no teeth
[1:02:14] the bible says
[1:02:17] lord the christ
[1:02:24] to look at that little baby and see
[1:02:26] all the things of almighty god
[1:02:29] was dwelling in that child
[1:02:33] but now come on we know the whole story
[1:02:35] because as i said this morning then that
[1:02:37] child and when that child was born it
[1:02:39] could not be your savior
[1:02:41] he couldn't display that then he
[1:02:43] couldn't manifest that
[1:02:44] he couldn't manifest a healer or
[1:02:46] deliverer etc
[1:02:49] he had to wait until time would come to
[1:02:51] those things would come into being
[1:02:54] but then when he would come into being
[1:02:55] see it would come into being correctly
[1:02:58] all right
[1:03:00] now what i want you to think about this
[1:03:02] afternoon and we're going to read a good
[1:03:04] bit about it
[1:03:07] is that god lives
[1:03:10] in a three-room house
[1:03:15] my god is in heaven and ruled everything
[1:03:21] oh wonderful
[1:03:23] he still lives in a three-room
[1:03:28] house but you just
[1:03:31] you're limiting him brother dale
[1:03:36] if anything you could say that he
[1:03:39] limited himself
[1:03:41] it's not got much to do with me and you
[1:03:44] right now you explained to me how he can
[1:03:46] put our sins in the sea of forgetfulness
[1:03:47] and never remember them
[1:03:49] i won't have to explain a lot of the
[1:03:50] other things
[1:03:54] because he evidently put him in there
[1:03:55] and
[1:03:56] closed the key and forgot about him
[1:03:59] i can't but he did
[1:04:02] all right
[1:04:04] but see think about it
[1:04:06] all right
[1:04:08] we covered this morning
[1:04:10] talking about man in his makeup
[1:04:14] of a triune being
[1:04:17] and that he was a triune being of body
[1:04:20] spirit and soul that's taken from god's
[1:04:22] covenant with abraham
[1:04:25] he said like god was a
[1:04:27] trinity
[1:04:30] in a man
[1:04:34] god was a trinity
[1:04:38] all right
[1:04:39] he goes on to anoint it not number two
[1:04:41] and what does he say
[1:04:44] that's god god in her trinity is one and
[1:04:46] without a trinity he's not god
[1:04:48] he can't be manifest in any other way
[1:04:52] and neither can you be manifested
[1:04:54] without being the trinity person that
[1:04:56] you are that's body spirit and soul
[1:04:58] without either one of them you're not
[1:05:00] complete
[1:05:01] see you didn't
[1:05:02] you didn't have a soul you'd be nothing
[1:05:05] you didn't have a spirit you would be
[1:05:07] nothing you didn't have a body
[1:05:09] you just be a spirit not a body so god
[1:05:12] is complete in the triunity of a being
[1:05:16] not triunity of beings
[1:05:18] but one being in a triunity father son
[1:05:21] and holy ghost
[1:05:23] is one true manifested god
[1:05:26] all right
[1:05:29] he goes on into the godhead number three
[1:05:32] in paragraph 255 and
[1:05:35] he speaks of
[1:05:37] god
[1:05:38] being in
[1:05:41] three offices
[1:05:43] not a trinity three gods we don't have
[1:05:45] no three gods certainly not there's no
[1:05:47] such a thing wasn't taught in the bible
[1:05:49] and there's only one god hear your
[1:05:50] israel the lord your god one god first
[1:05:54] commandment thou shalt have no other
[1:05:55] gods before me certainly he's the one
[1:05:58] god not three that's a catholic version
[1:06:00] of it and it was you know that's for you
[1:06:03] if you want it in some other way
[1:06:05] right
[1:06:07] but think about it
[1:06:11] to be almighty god to come down as the
[1:06:14] prophet explained it not sending a son
[1:06:16] or a second person
[1:06:18] but coming down himself
[1:06:21] then
[1:06:23] would he not come down himself
[1:06:26] in the image that he was before we ever
[1:06:29] thought about him
[1:06:32] that's where you don't like to go that
[1:06:33] away with me
[1:06:37] to go back and think before the
[1:06:38] foundation of the world
[1:06:40] before anything ever happened as the
[1:06:42] prophet called in the beginning before
[1:06:44] the eternal that's going way back isn't
[1:06:46] it
[1:06:47] and talking about this being
[1:06:52] well what form was he in
[1:06:56] well why can't you think that he was
[1:06:58] like a years now
[1:07:04] did he create some kind of a way of
[1:07:06] coming into being that's coming down to
[1:07:07] where he is now
[1:07:09] would you agree now that if you went to
[1:07:11] heaven that you would see him
[1:07:16] and that you would have body spirit and
[1:07:17] soul to be able to see him and he would
[1:07:19] be body spirit and soul for you to be
[1:07:21] able to see him
[1:07:25] i know what that requires of the human
[1:07:28] mind
[1:07:30] that requires beyond all things for you
[1:07:33] to believe it
[1:07:36] i know that
[1:07:38] and i know it's hard to do
[1:07:41] but it requires you to stop your own
[1:07:44] conceptions and thoughts
[1:07:46] and to take what god says by faith
[1:07:50] and wait upon him to explain it
[1:07:53] or reveal it or make it known to you i
[1:07:56] know that
[1:07:58] and see that's why that i do not try to
[1:08:00] preach to bodies
[1:08:05] i don't try to preach the
[1:08:08] spirits because you can sit there and
[1:08:10] grin at me and be right spitting through
[1:08:12] your teeth and saying dirty words about
[1:08:14] me through your spirit that's inside of
[1:08:16] you
[1:08:23] see i try to speak to that very inward
[1:08:25] part of you
[1:08:26] that is worth the world's because it's
[1:08:29] your soul
[1:08:30] and remember it's not the body that says
[1:08:32] that sinners shall die it's not the
[1:08:34] spirit that sinners shall die it's the
[1:08:35] soul that's in it shall die now if you
[1:08:39] want to read some go into ezekiel
[1:08:42] and read that
[1:08:43] you know from the book of ezekiel where
[1:08:45] we'll get into the uh points of
[1:08:48] of talking about you know the new earth
[1:08:51] eventually
[1:08:52] when we get it laid down enough in the
[1:08:54] human mind to see what mankind really is
[1:08:56] and
[1:08:57] and are in ezekiel where he said i'll
[1:08:59] give you a new heart a new spirit
[1:09:02] and then i'll put my spirit in you and
[1:09:04] thing see we were so massively confused
[1:09:06] on that until we where it said give you
[1:09:07] a new heart and your spirit we thought
[1:09:09] that was the holy spirit
[1:09:11] the prophet said that wasn't right
[1:09:15] he said you couldn't even stand yourself
[1:09:16] with that old spirit
[1:09:19] well see we got a lot to go right
[1:09:21] but now listen
[1:09:23] think about it for a moment
[1:09:26] god had to come in
[1:09:32] into our thinking
[1:09:35] into the ability for the human mind to
[1:09:38] comprehend enough
[1:09:40] he had to descend into the point of
[1:09:43] being a triune being
[1:09:47] not a trinity
[1:09:49] but a triune being
[1:09:52] and to do that then he would be coming
[1:09:54] into our image
[1:09:57] for us to be able to understand his
[1:09:59] image
[1:10:01] are you with me
[1:10:04] it was not to come into our image i'm
[1:10:06] into like us to just be one of us
[1:10:10] do you realize that god in jesus christ
[1:10:13] learned a lot of things that
[1:10:15] oh hold on that he didn't know
[1:10:21] you know he didn't know what sin was
[1:10:23] you know he didn't know what sickness
[1:10:25] was
[1:10:27] you know he learned those things by
[1:10:28] coming into human flesh
[1:10:32] right
[1:10:33] that's why the bible says he can sucker
[1:10:35] sympathize with us
[1:10:38] right is that our high priest
[1:10:41] but don't you ever think about a triune
[1:10:43] being as what we were talking about this
[1:10:44] morning body spirit and soul into
[1:10:46] dealing with and in the triune being as
[1:10:49] in the relationship to mankind
[1:10:52] see in body he was my brother that's
[1:10:54] what he is
[1:10:57] he doesn't mind calling me brother
[1:10:59] that's in body
[1:11:02] my brother then is necessary for the
[1:11:05] human part of him
[1:11:07] to be
[1:11:09] also my sacrifice
[1:11:14] right
[1:11:16] and the only way i can get
[1:11:18] healing
[1:11:20] from the point is it's got to be that
[1:11:23] his body had to be beaten
[1:11:25] to bring forth the healing of the body
[1:11:29] right
[1:11:30] now we'll have to hold a little point
[1:11:32] because see your redemptive plan was is
[1:11:35] not finished just in the part of your
[1:11:37] body
[1:11:38] even though that's part of your plan
[1:11:40] but it's got to be finished in a person
[1:11:43] all right
[1:11:44] so in body he was my brother he's my
[1:11:46] sacrifice
[1:11:48] well
[1:11:50] in spirit he was the anointing
[1:11:53] that anointed mankind back dire
[1:11:57] dramatic him now
[1:12:00] the prophets to speak
[1:12:02] and that by being the anointing that was
[1:12:05] back dire
[1:12:07] he can anoint our spirit
[1:12:10] right
[1:12:13] to do great wonders
[1:12:16] and that's what blinds
[1:12:20] people brother dunny and i were talking
[1:12:23] about a certain person
[1:12:25] that prays for the sick and sees them
[1:12:27] get healed
[1:12:30] but at the same time he's smoking his
[1:12:32] pot and probably drinking his liquors
[1:12:34] and everything else
[1:12:41] is that true
[1:12:45] is it the fact that we just covered the
[1:12:47] other day the anointing can be upon
[1:12:49] anyone
[1:12:50] and great things hey
[1:12:52] i thought we believed that judas is
[1:12:55] carried and part of the ministry
[1:13:00] right
[1:13:02] i thought that was the bible
[1:13:04] they ain't taken that out yet
[1:13:08] if obama can
[1:13:09] make his can't have a church for twice a
[1:13:11] month he might be able to take out john
[1:13:13] 3 16.
[1:13:19] but you see
[1:13:21] that's why the anointed ones will work
[1:13:25] because of the anointing
[1:13:28] that can come upon your spirit
[1:13:34] right
[1:13:35] right
[1:13:36] because
[1:13:37] the anointing on his spirit was the
[1:13:40] anointing that
[1:13:42] spoken hundred times in diverse manners
[1:13:45] through the prophets
[1:13:48] but it was the spirit of almighty god
[1:13:51] all right
[1:13:52] so we can have that anointing on our
[1:13:54] spirit
[1:13:57] to body to body he's my brother
[1:14:00] my sacrifice
[1:14:02] spirit to spirit he can be the anointing
[1:14:08] that sure guides me leads me does all
[1:14:10] kinds of things
[1:14:13] and that's why it didn't abrupt didn't
[1:14:14] prophet we gave it this the other day
[1:14:16] anointed he wants to enter he says why
[1:14:18] you can't tell that woman that's wrong
[1:14:20] to wear them pants and cut her hair and
[1:14:22] think
[1:14:24] you can't tell her that why because
[1:14:26] she's anointed
[1:14:28] just like i was saying about the one
[1:14:30] that we were referring to
[1:14:31] what do you think about it
[1:14:34] i told a brother one time i said your
[1:14:35] gift is your problem
[1:14:39] what about an anointing on a person and
[1:14:41] there you are setting our smoke in your
[1:14:43] joint
[1:14:46] and somebody comes up and you pray for
[1:14:48] them and god heals them
[1:14:50] and here comes a genuine christian up
[1:14:52] and you pray for them and they don't get
[1:14:54] healed
[1:15:00] come on am i right
[1:15:05] see that blinds that person because they
[1:15:07] say
[1:15:08] look at what i can do when they can't do
[1:15:10] it
[1:15:12] it's not working they're working here so
[1:15:15] god must think more of me
[1:15:18] than he does them
[1:15:25] is that right
[1:15:28] is there great healing campaigns went
[1:15:30] around the country
[1:15:32] by anointed ministers
[1:15:37] but yet at the bottom they were faults
[1:15:39] and wound up being in all kinds of
[1:15:41] things
[1:15:43] am i right
[1:15:49] so then body the body he's my brother
[1:15:51] he's my sacrifice spirit to spirit he is
[1:15:53] the anointing
[1:15:55] we'll get to it where it says you know
[1:15:56] that he
[1:15:58] take away your stony heart
[1:16:03] give your
[1:16:04] spirit now take out your spirit change
[1:16:08] the problems with it
[1:16:10] see
[1:16:12] so in body he was my brother my
[1:16:14] sacrifice and spirit he's the one in
[1:16:16] sundry time this fake end times price
[1:16:18] that can anoint my spirit the word that
[1:16:20] i can love him and do a great thing but
[1:16:23] soul to soul is the almighty god the
[1:16:26] manifestation of eternal life
[1:16:32] that's what the prophet said about it
[1:16:34] right
[1:16:35] he said you can have the baptism of the
[1:16:37] holy ghost every day of your life
[1:16:39] on your spirit and still be lost
[1:16:44] but he said one time in contact with god
[1:16:46] you'll never be the same
[1:16:49] see it's body to body it's spirit to
[1:16:52] spirit and it's soul to soul that's why
[1:16:54] he had to come those ways
[1:16:57] to be able to redeem
[1:16:59] because remember as i say and when i
[1:17:01] started the body can take care of the
[1:17:03] sacrifice and the point of the worth it
[1:17:06] could be the
[1:17:07] doings and and by stripes i'm healed
[1:17:12] but the anointing won't save
[1:17:14] you and the body can't save you
[1:17:20] it's the soul
[1:17:22] that has to come forth
[1:17:25] well why don't we believe the soul to be
[1:17:26] the more real than we do the rest
[1:17:30] what are we still keeping our minds and
[1:17:32] our our
[1:17:34] because satan's talking to him
[1:17:37] see his body could not give us eternal
[1:17:39] life
[1:17:42] even by stripes i'm healed goes into the
[1:17:43] atonement which would not be just
[1:17:45] because you could touch the blood and it
[1:17:47] would heal you that would not do it
[1:17:50] see his spirit is the anointing that can
[1:17:54] anoint us to do great things
[1:17:56] but cannot bring us
[1:17:59] eternal life
[1:18:05] see because his soul was the person of
[1:18:07] his being
[1:18:09] a priest one time years ago trying to
[1:18:11] explain it and his brother went and told
[1:18:13] his other brother he said brother dale
[1:18:15] please it god's got a soul
[1:18:17] i said he was wrong i don't believe
[1:18:20] god's got a soul
[1:18:23] because that's what the brother
[1:18:24] explained it to him he said brother dale
[1:18:27] is right it's not that god's got a soul
[1:18:30] he said god is a soul
[1:18:32] that's a being that's a person
[1:18:35] that's the person of eternal life
[1:18:38] not the anointings not the things it's
[1:18:40] the person of eternal life
[1:18:43] where do we get to the baptism of the
[1:18:44] holy ghost okay
[1:18:49] see we covered it in the old testament
[1:18:52] the spirit could be there
[1:18:54] and could anoint could anoint you
[1:18:57] to do great wonderful things but could
[1:19:00] not bring you to eternal life
[1:19:03] all right
[1:19:04] because
[1:19:06] john 7 and and 39 i believe it is he
[1:19:09] said
[1:19:11] that he's not
[1:19:15] yet been glorified
[1:19:18] the holy ghost had not been given
[1:19:21] because jesus did not come to the place
[1:19:22] of being glorified
[1:19:26] you see he had to come and die to
[1:19:28] release that life
[1:19:30] this the the body could be brother the
[1:19:33] brother the spirit could while it was
[1:19:36] there in him of the spirit that anointed
[1:19:39] those prophets that signed spirit could
[1:19:41] go right over on
[1:19:42] confess and prophesy of the death of
[1:19:45] jesus christ
[1:19:47] but it never saved cophase
[1:19:50] you remember he was the guy that put the
[1:19:51] trouble
[1:19:55] so in the old testament it was
[1:19:56] impossible for anybody to have
[1:20:00] the very person of god to come upon them
[1:20:03] in the form of the baptism of the holy
[1:20:05] ghost if you want to call it that's what
[1:20:07] the prophet would call it that he sent
[1:20:09] back his soul on the day of pentecost in
[1:20:10] the form of the baptism of the holy
[1:20:12] ghost because we believe in the baptism
[1:20:14] of the holy ghost
[1:20:16] it's not the way we used to believe him
[1:20:20] the soul of man is what became lost in
[1:20:23] the fall
[1:20:25] and there had to be someone come to pay
[1:20:27] that price
[1:20:28] and it would be the price of redemption
[1:20:31] so it would mean that a man would have
[1:20:33] to come
[1:20:35] why because man fell
[1:20:38] they agree
[1:20:40] then we would understand in revelations
[1:20:42] 5
[1:20:43] 3 and 4.
[1:20:46] were
[1:20:47] the proclamation went out
[1:20:50] for a man
[1:20:53] that could take the book
[1:20:56] right
[1:20:58] and it
[1:20:59] stipulates a man
[1:21:01] he says no man was found worthy
[1:21:06] brother branham said
[1:21:08] in the breach
[1:21:10] right down under where we're giving in
[1:21:11] just a minute if we get to it he said
[1:21:14] the prophets were there
[1:21:16] he said the sages were there
[1:21:18] you know those old testament people the
[1:21:20] really great ones
[1:21:21] he said but there's no man worthy
[1:21:25] now this is all i'll say about it if
[1:21:27] they were there in a total eternity
[1:21:29] state
[1:21:33] if they were there in a total eternity
[1:21:35] state
[1:21:36] why would the prophets and the sages not
[1:21:38] be worthy to take the book
[1:21:40] that's right
[1:21:43] i say no more
[1:21:47] why would it not be
[1:21:50] but see no man was found worthy
[1:21:52] brother brown said they searched heaven
[1:21:55] they searched the earth they searched
[1:21:57] everywhere
[1:21:58] and no man
[1:22:00] was found worthy
[1:22:02] there wasn't one man worthy that was the
[1:22:04] man christ jesus
[1:22:08] the man christ jesus many would be body
[1:22:10] spirit and soul
[1:22:12] or he's not a man
[1:22:16] i hope that's beginning to click
[1:22:20] and we know for certainty that he
[1:22:22] couldn't send somebody else
[1:22:25] well he sent the son the son came down
[1:22:27] because he was a man he was you know you
[1:22:29] know what is man a dark mindful of him
[1:22:32] so god had to come down
[1:22:36] and manifest himself
[1:22:38] in human flesh
[1:22:42] to pay the price
[1:22:45] and he had to die
[1:22:47] he couldn't just get old
[1:22:50] and do you know and give it no way he
[1:22:52] could anoint with his spirit
[1:22:54] that would anoint caiaphas that would
[1:22:55] have known all the different ones but he
[1:22:57] wouldn't do no good
[1:22:58] but he had to give his soul a ransom
[1:23:02] right
[1:23:04] the price had to be paid
[1:23:07] see he had to be a man
[1:23:10] and to be a man
[1:23:13] it meant according to what we just read
[1:23:15] while ago from paragraph 102 and knoweth
[1:23:18] it not he said without either one of
[1:23:21] these
[1:23:22] you are not complete
[1:23:25] without body spirit and soul you're not
[1:23:26] complete without body spirit and soul
[1:23:28] god's not complete without father son
[1:23:30] and holy ghost god is not complete
[1:23:33] all right
[1:23:35] god is not a trinity of beings
[1:23:39] he is a triune being father son and holy
[1:23:41] ghost
[1:23:44] all right
[1:23:46] now let's just read these to where you
[1:23:48] won't think
[1:23:49] that
[1:23:50] i make up my own thoughts and ideas
[1:23:53] that's why i like for you to read
[1:23:56] what the prophet has to say
[1:23:58] at least you've got to say then well he
[1:24:00] said what he said
[1:24:01] i don't agree with him but he said what
[1:24:03] he said at least let my my life be that
[1:24:07] the word that i believe in the message
[1:24:09] of the hour
[1:24:11] for what the prophet had to say so go
[1:24:12] ahead number four and let's talk about
[1:24:14] this three-room house
[1:24:17] three-room house is body spirit and soul
[1:24:20] all right
[1:24:22] look what he says now and god's provided
[1:24:24] way of approach to fellowship
[1:24:26] in 1960.
[1:24:28] now you can only live in a three-room
[1:24:29] house did you know that god lived in a
[1:24:31] three-room house
[1:24:33] you live in a three-room house
[1:24:35] you dwell in the three-room house god
[1:24:37] lived in christ
[1:24:40] soul body and spirit
[1:24:46] well now you argue your point with him
[1:24:50] see
[1:24:51] god lived in christ soul body and spirit
[1:24:55] you live soul body and spirit you live
[1:24:58] in a house of your own here on earth
[1:25:00] you may have two bedrooms et cetera and
[1:25:03] all like that but you only live in a one
[1:25:04] in a three-room house you got bedrooms
[1:25:06] kitchens parlors
[1:25:08] go ahead to the next
[1:25:10] a hidden life
[1:25:13] which is 1955.
[1:25:17] any reader knows that there were three
[1:25:20] watch it there were three two veils two
[1:25:23] compartments
[1:25:24] and a congregation in
[1:25:27] the set up of god's tabernacle in the
[1:25:29] wilderness you had outer court inner
[1:25:31] court holy of holies there's only two
[1:25:33] veils
[1:25:37] well i thought there's three where are
[1:25:39] you gonna put the third
[1:25:42] outer court there's no veil there's a
[1:25:45] court separating outer from the second
[1:25:47] so that's why he said three two
[1:25:50] you come right back to his point
[1:25:52] see you've got the veil here read the
[1:25:54] bible
[1:25:56] you've got this out you've got outer
[1:25:57] court inner court holy of holies there's
[1:25:59] only two veils separating
[1:26:04] all right
[1:26:05] you come body spirit and soul
[1:26:07] but you're not separated okay we're
[1:26:09] going
[1:26:10] you just think of that because if you go
[1:26:12] back into the tabernacle and study the
[1:26:14] tabernacle it was a three room house
[1:26:18] outer court inner court holy of holies
[1:26:21] all right
[1:26:23] the first was the congregation in the
[1:26:25] holy place then the holy of holies
[1:26:26] that's god's house that's god's dwelling
[1:26:28] place that's your dwelling place
[1:26:31] now you only live in a three
[1:26:33] room house remember you might have two
[1:26:35] bedrooms you may have three kitchens but
[1:26:38] you only have only live in a three-room
[1:26:41] house
[1:26:42] god lived in a three-room house
[1:26:44] when god was here on earth he occupied a
[1:26:48] three-room house
[1:26:50] the soul body and spirit of jesus christ
[1:26:55] is that enough
[1:26:59] well we won't stop
[1:27:02] look what he goes on to fellowship in
[1:27:03] 1960 number six brothers
[1:27:07] just like
[1:27:09] your life you're living your life
[1:27:13] you live in the same if you only live in
[1:27:14] a three-room house
[1:27:16] god lived in a three-room house soul
[1:27:18] body and spirit god lived in a
[1:27:20] three-room house it's father son and
[1:27:22] holy ghost
[1:27:24] and you live in a three-room house
[1:27:27] the spirit comes to a three-room house
[1:27:30] justification sanctification baptism of
[1:27:32] the holy ghost and you live in a
[1:27:34] three-room house natural first you have
[1:27:36] the kitchen next you have the parlor and
[1:27:39] next you have the bedroom all right
[1:27:41] number seven
[1:27:42] which is the basics of fellowship 1961.
[1:27:46] in 1960 1961.
[1:27:49] like a man getting married when he gets
[1:27:51] married you live in a three-room house
[1:27:53] you know that or you say i beg your
[1:27:55] pardon i got ten no you haven't you only
[1:27:58] live in a three-room house you know you
[1:27:59] can only be in one room
[1:28:01] why do we have all these rooms in a
[1:28:02] house you only be in one room at a time
[1:28:07] right
[1:28:09] let me we got one two three we got four
[1:28:12] bedrooms the only thing i wish in my
[1:28:14] house was eight bathrooms
[1:28:16] if i ever build another house i'll build
[1:28:18] a house i'll put a bathroom and every
[1:28:19] house in the room in the house
[1:28:22] then i'll have one just in case
[1:28:25] not in a master
[1:28:27] some more sticking in the hallway
[1:28:29] because you can never have that
[1:28:32] all right
[1:28:33] listen you only live in a three-room
[1:28:35] house that you may have three or four
[1:28:36] bedrooms or three or four pantries and
[1:28:38] things like that but you actually live
[1:28:40] in a three-room house that is the
[1:28:42] kitchen the living room and the bedroom
[1:28:43] that's right you live in a three-room
[1:28:45] house god lived in a three-room house
[1:28:48] father son and holy ghost you live in a
[1:28:50] three-room house soul body and spirit
[1:28:54] why can't you put them all together
[1:28:56] and just keep on going with it
[1:28:59] come on
[1:29:00] read the next
[1:29:02] waters of separation 1955.
[1:29:06] there's none of you but lives in a
[1:29:07] three-room house that's all you live in
[1:29:10] just live in a three-room house when god
[1:29:12] was here he lived in a three-room house
[1:29:16] that's all you could live in the first
[1:29:17] is your kitchen or next to the dining
[1:29:19] room or living room the next is your
[1:29:21] bedroom you may have three or four
[1:29:22] bedrooms but there's really there's
[1:29:25] extra rooms okay
[1:29:27] going to the next one the intervale
[1:29:29] which is the message they changed back
[1:29:31] under but they still use the title
[1:29:33] interval you're living in a house soul
[1:29:36] body and spirit that's the way god lived
[1:29:38] in jesus christ both soul body and
[1:29:41] spirit
[1:29:42] not me that doeth the works the father
[1:29:44] that dwelleth in me you see
[1:29:45] all right number 10
[1:29:48] dedication of a building to the lord
[1:29:52] he says this
[1:29:55] yeah
[1:29:56] the serpent itself and the pole spoke of
[1:29:58] judgment past god's divine judgment on
[1:30:01] the serpent and spoke of the coming of
[1:30:03] christ
[1:30:04] where he would be made sin now that was
[1:30:06] what back there spoke of the coming of
[1:30:08] christ
[1:30:09] where he would be made sin and god's
[1:30:11] divine judgment would be poured out on
[1:30:13] him that he being man and god would have
[1:30:16] to come down made lower than the angel
[1:30:19] so that he might die for the sins of all
[1:30:22] his soul could not die
[1:30:25] because he was god
[1:30:28] amen
[1:30:30] well see the spirit can't die
[1:30:34] the soul can't die the spirit can't die
[1:30:38] the spirit goes back to god who gave it
[1:30:40] right
[1:30:41] i mean talking about me and you
[1:30:44] but god had god
[1:30:47] but his body had to be made a body of
[1:30:49] flesh
[1:30:50] so that it could die to be a sacrifice a
[1:30:53] virgin-born body die for a sacrifice
[1:30:55] that we sinful people might be brought
[1:30:58] not unto god by believing okay let's get
[1:31:01] the next one we'll have all of it read
[1:31:04] which is the breach
[1:31:07] so it took a human kinsman
[1:31:10] and he asked for it and wasn't found
[1:31:11] nowhere there's nobody no bishop no
[1:31:14] archbishop no priest no irk no nothing
[1:31:17] was even that didn't have
[1:31:20] didn't even have the holiest enough to
[1:31:22] even look at the book
[1:31:24] we my my that's pretty strong but that's
[1:31:28] what the bible said friends i'm just
[1:31:30] quoting what
[1:31:32] john said
[1:31:33] nobody is worthy
[1:31:36] to take the book
[1:31:40] but there had to be a man
[1:31:44] it couldn't just be a spirit an
[1:31:45] anointing or whatever
[1:31:49] it had to be that he gave his own life
[1:31:54] brother branham said he tore
[1:31:57] the soul
[1:31:58] out of jesus christ
[1:32:01] now what does he mean
[1:32:05] i mean he's reaching
[1:32:09] or you use the word ripped out of him
[1:32:15] what happened
[1:32:16] at the crucifixion
[1:32:21] we read some this morning where we were
[1:32:23] talking about
[1:32:24] his body went to the grave
[1:32:27] his spirit went to god who gave it
[1:32:30] his soul went under the altar and when
[1:32:32] time would be finished
[1:32:34] it would release he would release his
[1:32:36] spirit it would go to his soul and go to
[1:32:39] the body and said he would stand forth
[1:32:41] he did in the resurrection
[1:32:43] all right
[1:32:44] and he says that's the things that will
[1:32:46] happen to you and i
[1:32:49] we die our soul goes under the altar
[1:32:52] the spirit goes back to god who gave it
[1:32:54] and don't ask me to explain that because
[1:32:55] i can't
[1:32:57] no problem
[1:32:58] and his body goes to the our body would
[1:33:00] go to the grave but in the
[1:33:02] in the resurrection
[1:33:04] then the spirit will be released and
[1:33:05] come to the soul the soul to the body
[1:33:09] and we'll stand forth again in the
[1:33:10] resurrection
[1:33:12] all right
[1:33:14] now what happened
[1:33:16] how did that man become
[1:33:19] the kinsmen that we needed
[1:33:21] because his body was just my brother
[1:33:24] and his body could only fulfill the part
[1:33:27] that where it was beaten
[1:33:28] that
[1:33:30] the atonement would come through the
[1:33:31] stripes that he took
[1:33:34] the spirit could not come back and save
[1:33:37] us
[1:33:40] so it had to be
[1:33:42] that his soul would have to be released
[1:33:46] to come back
[1:33:49] so what happened hanging on calvary
[1:33:53] there was the body
[1:33:56] there was the one who said
[1:34:00] into thy hands i commend my spirit
[1:34:04] he spoke over in the garden right prior
[1:34:06] to the end and saying
[1:34:08] my soul is troubled
[1:34:12] so he didn't mind associating with body
[1:34:13] spirit and soul
[1:34:17] but on the crucifixion
[1:34:19] he
[1:34:22] there hung the body
[1:34:26] he said in thy hands i commend my spirit
[1:34:28] he went back to god who gave it
[1:34:33] and the soul left the body
[1:34:36] and the body was dead
[1:34:42] had to come back to him in less than 72
[1:34:44] hours because corruption would have set
[1:34:46] in
[1:34:50] all right
[1:34:52] his soul went to hell to preach to the
[1:34:54] spirits in prison
[1:34:58] but one day when the time was finished
[1:35:00] or the bar the prophet said was finished
[1:35:03] the fulfilling of the scripture that he
[1:35:04] had to be three days and three nights in
[1:35:06] the heart of the earth when that was
[1:35:08] fulfilled
[1:35:10] his soul come to our spirit to his soul
[1:35:13] soul to the body
[1:35:15] and he resurrected
[1:35:19] body spirit and soul
[1:35:22] because he was almighty god
[1:35:25] that soul simply stepped out of that
[1:35:27] body it was not what we would call what
[1:35:29] are the terminologies would you use to
[1:35:31] just say ripped out or tore out
[1:35:34] it meant that
[1:35:36] the exit of the soul from the body
[1:35:41] is what brings death
[1:35:45] the exit from of your soul from your
[1:35:47] body brings death to your body
[1:35:51] because the spirit in the body's you
[1:35:53] know the body's no good anyway for
[1:35:54] nothing it's just helpless
[1:35:57] body without the spirit is dead but you
[1:35:59] take all that out so what happened on
[1:36:01] the cross
[1:36:03] god just simply stepped out of the body
[1:36:07] right
[1:36:08] i mean he just simply exited the body
[1:36:12] what happens when you die
[1:36:18] your spirit goes back to god who gave it
[1:36:20] you just simply step out of your body
[1:36:22] right when everything is finished and
[1:36:25] you're coming back spirit release so
[1:36:27] come back steps in the body you stand
[1:36:29] on earth in the same body you lived in
[1:36:32] right
[1:36:33] right
[1:36:35] is that hard to understand that that's
[1:36:36] what happened at calvary
[1:36:44] and then when he raised
[1:36:48] they could see that he was a body
[1:36:51] there's a little transition period in
[1:36:52] there when he said don't touch me i'm
[1:36:54] not yet ascended but i love what he told
[1:36:56] him there he said i go to your god and
[1:36:58] my god i go to your father and my father
[1:37:01] i love that scripture
[1:37:03] but you know a few days later
[1:37:06] brother brown said and i i love this
[1:37:08] because i know when you you study in
[1:37:10] science is einstein said in the fourth
[1:37:13] dimension you travel so fast he said
[1:37:15] until
[1:37:16] one object would go through the other
[1:37:18] object and never leave a hole
[1:37:21] he said you could turn a baseball inside
[1:37:23] out and never break the cover
[1:37:26] that was his terminologies of explaining
[1:37:28] speed
[1:37:30] what do you call it g-forces when they
[1:37:32] look at these things and you see a guy
[1:37:34] he's taking off on those jets and all at
[1:37:36] once his whole facial features just run
[1:37:38] all over him because that's that g-force
[1:37:40] that's contrary to the human parts of
[1:37:43] him
[1:37:45] brother branham i was listening one day
[1:37:46] and he said it like this he said he'd
[1:37:48] come back so fast
[1:37:52] he said he'd come back so fast he said
[1:37:55] he just stepped right through the wall
[1:38:01] he just appeared right among them
[1:38:04] he just come back so fast
[1:38:08] no wonder it says in a
[1:38:10] twinkling of an eye you know
[1:38:13] the batting of an eye
[1:38:15] speed
[1:38:20] but you see
[1:38:22] he come back in a body
[1:38:25] to prove he was in that body what did he
[1:38:27] say
[1:38:28] he said bring me some fish
[1:38:32] you got any bread any fish
[1:38:35] right
[1:38:37] spirits don't eat
[1:38:39] theophanies don't eat or we were in the
[1:38:40] mess
[1:38:42] he was back in that flesh again
[1:38:45] where will we see him when it's all over
[1:38:46] with we'll have a body like unto his
[1:38:48] glorious body
[1:38:52] we meet the body in the air it doesn't
[1:38:53] come to this earth
[1:38:56] we made him in the air
[1:39:00] think on these things god actually lives
[1:39:02] then in a three-room house now only
[1:39:05] thing i'm going to say is one more word
[1:39:08] where did he live before he come across
[1:39:11] that
[1:39:14] line that we drawed to call it
[1:39:16] of it
[1:39:18] beyond eternity here and back over this
[1:39:20] way that was still not time
[1:39:23] where did he come from and what they
[1:39:25] look like
[1:39:30] now according to brother branham
[1:39:34] when moses saw the back part of the man
[1:39:39] he said it looked like jesus christ
[1:39:46] and that's the theophany
[1:39:48] so you think ethiopia is going to look
[1:39:50] like one thing and we're going to be
[1:39:51] something else
[1:39:55] well you get it about like your sisters
[1:39:56] wants to get it done to the men too
[1:39:58] because we all getting into that you
[1:39:59] know
[1:40:00] well one of these days my theophany will
[1:40:03] be just
[1:40:10] whatever it was about 18 19 years old
[1:40:12] might be you
[1:40:16] right
[1:40:18] i was explaining to a lady one day and
[1:40:20] i'm sorry i couldn't have it
[1:40:23] but i believe i read her mind
[1:40:25] she said was talking about
[1:40:28] one day we'll we'll have a glorified
[1:40:30] body you know
[1:40:32] and it'll be about 18 20 years old and
[1:40:34] she was sitting there she had it was all
[1:40:36] over her she was
[1:40:43] i think she had her mind in the wrong
[1:40:44] place
[1:40:46] because i think she was thinking about
[1:40:47] she's going to get them curved you know
[1:40:51] well i don't give a hoot what they look
[1:40:53] like as long as i got eternal life
[1:40:56] i'll let him worry about what i'm
[1:40:58] supposed to look like
[1:41:00] right won't you
[1:41:02] all right we won't worry about it let's
[1:41:04] stand together
[1:41:06] we're going to go into the communion
[1:41:10] think on these things folks
[1:41:13] next we'll get into the
[1:41:16] the new birth
[1:41:18] maybe talk about some things
[1:41:21] and like i said study the book of
[1:41:23] ezekiel
[1:41:24] especially 36
[1:41:27] there where it comes around and
[1:41:30] you know the things
[1:41:33] and it's bringing that to a point
[1:41:36] if the brothers will go ahead get
[1:41:37] everything ready
[1:41:42] let's go into the scriptures
[1:41:44] because we changed our communion over
[1:41:46] from last sunday to this sunday because
[1:41:48] so many of us being away and do until we
[1:41:51] changed it where everybody could be here
[1:41:54] all right
[1:41:56] first corinthians 11 23 for have i have
[1:42:00] received of the lord that which also i
[1:42:02] delivered unto you
[1:42:03] that the lord jesus the same night in
[1:42:05] which he was betrayed took bread you had
[1:42:07] never thought about that paul was chosen
[1:42:09] to write about the communion when he was
[1:42:12] never there with the lord jesus
[1:42:17] all the other disciples and all were
[1:42:19] there with the lord jesus
[1:42:22] but they were never chosen to write a
[1:42:23] word about the communion
[1:42:27] so what does he say
[1:42:29] for i have received of the lord
[1:42:35] he could take all those old testament
[1:42:36] scriptures and point it right down
[1:42:39] and bring it to the communion like wade
[1:42:40] was bringing out that time that there
[1:42:42] was always that bread those things was
[1:42:44] left
[1:42:46] there
[1:42:47] to represent this that would come forth
[1:42:50] but the lord jesus same night in which
[1:42:52] he was afraid took bread and when he had
[1:42:54] given thanks he break it and said take
[1:42:56] heed this is my body which is broken for
[1:42:57] you this is due in remembrance of me
[1:43:00] after the same manner also he took the
[1:43:01] cup when he had stopped saying
[1:43:03] this cup is the new testament in my
[1:43:05] blood this do you as often as you drink
[1:43:07] it in remembrance of me
[1:43:09] for as often as you eat this bread and
[1:43:10] drink this cup you do shoe the lord's
[1:43:12] death till he come wherefore whosoever
[1:43:14] shall eat this bread and drink this cup
[1:43:16] of the lord unworthily shall be guilty
[1:43:19] of the body and blood of the lord but
[1:43:21] let a man examine himself and so let him
[1:43:23] eat of that bread and drink of that cup
[1:43:25] for he that eateth and drinketh
[1:43:26] unworthily eateth and drinketh damnation
[1:43:28] to himself not discerning the lord's
[1:43:30] body
[1:43:31] for this cause many are weak and sickly
[1:43:33] among you and many sleep
[1:43:35] for if we would judge ourselves we
[1:43:37] should not be judged but when we are
[1:43:39] judged we are chaste unto the lord that
[1:43:41] we should not be condemned with the
[1:43:42] world wherefore my brethren when you
[1:43:44] come together to eat pray one for
[1:43:46] another and if any man hunger let him
[1:43:48] meet at home that you come not together
[1:43:51] and condem unto condemnation
[1:43:53] and the rest will i sit in order
[1:43:55] when i come
[1:43:59] so let's just have a few moments of
[1:44:00] silent prayer before we go into the
[1:44:03] communion and just think about these
[1:44:05] things
[1:44:07] think about what he's done for us and
[1:44:09] how he paid the price for us
[1:44:11] made us worthy to take the communion
[1:44:32] father we thank you for this opportunity
[1:44:34] this afternoon
[1:44:35] to be able to come together and
[1:44:36] participate in this
[1:44:38] communion as we call it
[1:44:40] and lord that you would make us worthy
[1:44:42] first off
[1:44:44] because none of us are worthy whatsoever
[1:44:47] if no one was worthy to take the book
[1:44:49] and if no one could even look upon the
[1:44:51] book
[1:44:54] how much more worthy would we be on
[1:44:56] anything else
[1:44:57] so we're not even worthy to take the
[1:44:59] communion
[1:45:01] but you
[1:45:02] have made us worthy
[1:45:04] you're the one that takes care of all
[1:45:06] things
[1:45:08] so we ask you to just cleanse us from
[1:45:10] any problems it would be any hindrance
[1:45:12] and
[1:45:13] sanctifies a new in you lord that we may
[1:45:17] see what these things really mean to
[1:45:19] each and every one of us
[1:45:20] forgive our sins cleanse us and guide us
[1:45:24] and let your grace be sufficient
[1:45:27] bless each one that protects the lord
[1:45:29] and may we all be together as one in you
[1:45:31] in jesus name
