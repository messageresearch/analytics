[17:51] in Jesus Christ's name amen and amen you
[17:54] may receive
[17:56] amen praise God
[18:00] he said why why are
[18:03] my soul
[18:04] my Souls down so you know every time I
[18:07] believe
[18:08] many of us go through this battle of
[18:10] discouragement and David here being a
[18:12] little discouraged and you know with
[18:15] maybe things not going like he thought
[18:16] they were to go like a lot of times we
[18:19] we think we get in our mind you know we
[18:21] get in our mind this is the way it ought
[18:23] to go this is the way it ought to be
[18:25] this is the way it ought to happen and
[18:28] then you know and it don't happen like
[18:30] we think it ought to happen brother
[18:31] Donnie and and you know sometimes it
[18:33] discourages because you know we're
[18:34] thinking through a carnal mind sometimes
[18:37] and you know I'm glad Paul said that we
[18:39] can let he said let this mind that was
[18:41] in Christ be in you amen and he told us
[18:43] he said cast down every imagination and
[18:46] bring every thought Under The Obedience
[18:49] of Jesus Christ so you know I believe
[18:51] the pride has come to the Ace of where
[18:53] she ought to think like God Walk Like
[18:55] God live like God and be so so close and
[18:59] hit her her attributes and her
[19:01] everything she does should be so much
[19:03] like God that she should be and she
[19:05] should almost be mistaken for God that's
[19:07] right amen because you know the prophet
[19:09] was you know you know he was mistaken
[19:11] for him but he was just a man like me
[19:13] and you but I'm thankful for this one
[19:15] that God wants to live that same life
[19:16] because the prophet left don't mean that
[19:19] lives left don't mean the Holy Ghost is
[19:21] left that life is still here to live
[19:23] live in me and you and to bring me and
[19:26] you to bring forth the fruits that he
[19:28] has need of in this season I'm so
[19:31] thankful that he didn't go by us in
[19:33] curses but he he blessed us because you
[19:35] know he cursed a fig tree and I believe
[19:37] the curses have been upon the church
[19:39] world because of her rejection of the
[19:41] truth you know and she thinks she's
[19:43] walking in truth but yet she's blind but
[19:46] that's another said but we want to talk
[19:48] this morning about discouragement uh I
[19:51] like what my pastor said one time he was
[19:52] talking at the ministers meeting with
[19:55] his dinner and he's talking about how
[19:57] that Satan had this great this great
[19:59] auction he was auctioning the things
[20:01] that he used the weapons that he used
[20:03] against every everybody that that was
[20:06] affected and used and he had all of them
[20:09] sitting out there and he had one covered
[20:10] up and he began to tell him he began to
[20:13] tell the devil the the demons this one
[20:15] here is lust it works on many people but
[20:18] it don't work on a lot of people this
[20:19] was lying it works on many people but it
[20:22] don't work on everybody this one's
[20:24] cheating and they said well you know
[20:26] that we want these but sit we're
[20:28] interested in that one that you've got
[20:29] covered up out here what is this he said
[20:32] oh you can't have this one this is one
[20:34] of my my greatest weapons that I had
[20:36] they said well well you sure want to see
[20:39] what it is we want to know what this
[20:42] weapon you you have that you that
[20:44] he works on you and you say it works on
[20:46] everybody and he said well
[20:50] back and I'll let you see just exactly
[20:53] what it is and he said this is my weapon
[20:55] called discouragement and this morning I
[20:58] would like to talk about discouragement
[20:59] because we see that even even with Jonah
[21:02] when we see that Jonah he wanted to go
[21:04] down he wanted to go down to Tarsus and
[21:06] God wanted him to go down to Nineveh and
[21:08] you know he had to work out the plan of
[21:11] God a lot of people you know Brothers
[21:12] said John was backslidden but no he was
[21:15] he was just he had just got out of the
[21:17] will of God he had a desire to say a lot
[21:19] of times ministers we get out of the
[21:21] will of God in the things we do and you
[21:23] know he God had told him just go down at
[21:25] Nineveh and preach I'm going to be with
[21:27] you I'm going to look out for you I'm
[21:30] gonna I'm gonna be your help I'm gonna
[21:31] be the one that will keep you and help
[21:34] you through this time but little did he
[21:36] know that was it was all God's plan for
[21:39] him to get on that ship go down to
[21:41] tarshas because see God had that plan
[21:43] because he had he had when Jesus come he
[21:47] was going to use Jonah as an
[21:49] illustration see he said as Jonah was in
[21:51] the bed of the whale three days so shall
[21:54] the son of man be in the belly of the
[21:56] earth see Jonah didn't know that God was
[21:58] working that permission will of God into
[22:01] his perfect will and see when he got on
[22:04] that boat you know old Jonah said well
[22:06] you know I don't want to go down there
[22:07] you know I don't want to go down and
[22:09] preaching that crowd and you know there
[22:10] are a bunch of healings and more
[22:12] Gentiles they won't listen to me they'll
[22:14] probably kill me Lord and God you're a
[22:15] merciful god and he's a merciful god but
[22:18] you know he got down there he got on
[22:20] that ship he went on down they told him
[22:22] they said sleep how can you be asleep
[22:24] and they're fixing to destroy him he
[22:25] said I know what's going on I realize
[22:28] it's because me that this trouble has
[22:29] come on you and a lot of times we don't
[22:31] realize because our actions sometimes
[22:33] not only affects us but it affects
[22:36] others
[22:37] and you know a long time we like to say
[22:39] this whole thing uh Ministry loves
[22:41] company
[22:42] you know but we don't want to be we
[22:44] don't want to live a miserable Christian
[22:45] Life we want to live a joyful and a
[22:47] peaceful life in Christ Jesus
[22:49] so here's Jonah here he is uh and they
[22:53] they bring him up there and he says just
[22:54] are you sure because they figured out he
[22:56] was a man of God you sure because he was
[22:58] they respected this man because they
[23:00] seen God was on him God wanted he was
[23:02] gonna he was going to do what God wanted
[23:04] him to do he said so just throw me over
[23:06] just throw me a list of wait a minute
[23:08] you sure it won't stop till you do till
[23:11] you get me out of here gotta tear this
[23:14] ship up
[23:15] he's determined to get it get me over
[23:17] there the name of him and so he throwed
[23:20] him over and here's a great fish
[23:22] prepared for him and here he goes down
[23:23] there and all because of the grace of
[23:26] grace of God and you know
[23:28] Jonah didn't realize that he was in the
[23:30] will of God he began to sit down in
[23:32] there and I believe I believe he got a
[23:33] little discouraged down there in the
[23:35] building that old whale because you know
[23:37] he had nothing to rain but no seaweed
[23:38] and no stomach and all that old acids
[23:41] and seven they're already sitting down
[23:43] in there and he said Lord I do remember
[23:45] what Solomon's praying he said if you're
[23:49] people are in trouble if I'll turn my
[23:52] head toward the temple and cry I'll hear
[23:55] from God so this morning we don't have a
[23:58] certain Temple or a certain church we
[24:00] turn to but we have a greater Temple the
[24:02] temple called Jesus Christ we can turn
[24:04] to him in our time of distress in our
[24:06] time of discouragement and he began to
[24:08] pray and here it was three days later
[24:11] he'd probably he probably didn't know
[24:13] what was always going on he probably
[24:15] didn't understand everything but here's
[24:16] this big old here's this big old fish
[24:18] this comes up on the bank well he didn't
[24:20] know he had a one-way express Ticket I
[24:23] mean look here he already had a bus for
[24:26] him he used his whale to push him right
[24:29] on Overton to Nineveh and so he'd bring
[24:31] him over here Here Comes this great big
[24:34] old well up on the bank
[24:36] holds his mouth and out walks a man a
[24:41] man preaching hell fire and brimstone
[24:44] and they said oh my goodness and you
[24:47] know that that they worshiped a fish God
[24:50] right right and he preached such a
[24:52] message under such an anointing that
[24:55] even they put sackcloth on the on the
[24:57] animals
[24:58] and here they repented
[25:01] and God has sent him down there gonna
[25:03] see that they repented because God is a
[25:05] merciful god he always brings warning
[25:08] before he brings judgment
[25:11] and here Jonah sees that God's merciful
[25:13] and he gets discouraged again you know
[25:15] preachers are probably the moodiest
[25:17] people you've ever I'm not used to these
[25:20] sunglasses
[25:21] but you know preachers are Moody you
[25:24] know they come in and they get another
[25:25] anointing then they come out behind that
[25:27] anointing and they get they get you know
[25:29] Moody and here he was sitting out there
[25:31] and he said he he just got right angry
[25:34] with God he said Lord I know you're
[25:36] merciful I knew you'd be merciful to him
[25:39] why did you send me down here here I am
[25:41] sitting out here in this heat and here I
[25:44] am trying to find a place to rest and so
[25:47] God brought rose up this little door
[25:50] this little garden that come over him
[25:52] and put a little shade on that old
[25:53] prophet's bald head and he thought oh my
[25:56] that's so nice that's so nice you know
[25:59] what he he was trying to get him to the
[26:00] place to realize that everything works
[26:02] for the good to those that fear and love
[26:04] God and this little girl was saying he
[26:07] thought all this is so nice but God was
[26:09] going to show him he's going to give him
[26:11] a revelation
[26:12] and here's this little worm comes and it
[26:16] eats the garden the gourd dies oh here I
[26:19] am again Lord Lord what what are you
[26:23] what are you doing with me well why are
[26:25] you allowing me that this to happen to
[26:26] me oh yeah oh yeah and he said you was
[26:28] more concerned about this door than he
[26:30] was about them
[26:32] he said what's more valuable or so or a
[26:36] plant right you know we got a lot of
[26:38] people as Tree Huggers you know what
[26:40] they're more they're more they they love
[26:41] more than the vegetation more than they
[26:44] do one another you know and they love
[26:47] animals more than they love their
[26:50] brothers and sisters you know you can
[26:52] they'll put you in jail for killing a
[26:54] cat or a dog and we shouldn't do those
[26:57] things but you know the human they say
[26:59] like their life is so invaluable to them
[27:02] you know because they've been polluted
[27:04] by the God of this evil age they don't
[27:07] know the real value of a soul
[27:11] but here here I like how the Lord deal
[27:13] with Jonah Jonah began to get angry and
[27:16] he said
[27:18] hey Johnny to get angry so you know
[27:21] sometimes he lets you
[27:25] lesson says you're good to get that way
[27:27] now straighten up and fly right you know
[27:32] what I like the way God deals with us
[27:33] that way and so you know they went
[27:35] through discouragement here for for and
[27:38] he went for a while but I want to talk
[27:39] about the work I want to look at the
[27:40] work instrument the meaning of
[27:42] discouragement and we see Satan tries to
[27:45] always attack us we're discouragement
[27:47] trying to discourage us
[27:49] when we say the word means to the
[27:51] private courage
[27:54] we should be very courageous in this age
[27:56] we live in this is the time for the
[27:59] bride to shine
[28:00] this is not the time for her to be
[28:03] scared or a coward
[28:05] this is a time for her to take the sword
[28:07] and possess the land right to take to
[28:11] take to take over the gates of our enemy
[28:13] it means to
[28:16] to deprive of confidence
[28:19] to dishearten to hinder by this favoring
[28:23] you know what when you go through a
[28:25] trial brother Donnie sometimes you see
[28:27] that you're going through this trial and
[28:28] Satan will tell you see that God's mad
[28:30] at you you've done something dumb again
[28:33] and I said well probably did but that
[28:36] don't mean he's mad that means he loves
[28:38] me if he wasn't whooping me I mean he
[28:41] didn't love me for he said he chases and
[28:43] rebukes those who you'll ever see Satan
[28:45] tries to manipulate the word he tries to
[28:48] get into the place of work will
[28:49] dislocate the word or misplaced the word
[28:51] he said there's taking the word for what
[28:53] it is and say it and believe it just
[28:56] like it's wrote
[28:57] and he tries to get us to be discouraged
[29:00] turn women to the book of Deuteronomy
[29:02] chapter 31 just for a minute I love the
[29:05] commission of God to his children
[29:08] this wasn't just to the prophets and
[29:10] this wasn't just to the wasn't just to
[29:12] the to uh Joshua but I like what he says
[29:16] here for Moses in Deuteronomy 31 8 he
[29:18] says and the Lord I like that
[29:22] he wasn't Aaron
[29:23] it wasn't nobody else that says in the
[29:25] Lord
[29:27] he is that goat that does go before thee
[29:31] he will be with thee he will not fail
[29:35] thee how can I that's one thing Our God
[29:38] can't do is fail a sister David he can't
[29:41] fail I've never read in the scripture
[29:43] one place where God ever failed what he
[29:47] was trying to do
[29:49] he passed it
[29:51] he possessed everything he said he would
[29:53] do
[29:54] right he said he'll never pray he will
[29:55] not fail thee neither for safety see
[29:58] that's what gate Satan tries to do here
[30:00] taxes oh he's failed you if he really
[30:02] what he tell the prophet you know you
[30:04] preach Divine Healing all these years
[30:06] here's your wife then here's your baby
[30:09] died if he really is God then why ain't
[30:13] he healed him
[30:15] that's right come on
[30:18] you better know
[30:21] you better know you've got the goodies
[30:24] amen he said fear not
[30:28] he said no fear for over in Timothy says
[30:30] God has not given us the spirit of fear
[30:32] but of love and a sound mind we ought to
[30:36] thank God this one that we're setting in
[30:37] this place with a sound mind the world
[30:39] is insane
[30:41] they're calling everything that's bad
[30:44] good
[30:45] and everything that's good is bad
[30:48] see it's the god of the same place he
[30:51] said neither be thou neither be dismayed
[30:56] the word is
[31:01] let's see where I don't write this down
[31:02] listen
[31:05] the word dismayed means to do the same
[31:08] thing means it means a sudden loss of
[31:12] Courage
[31:13] a resolution from alarm
[31:16] or fear a sudden disappointment see
[31:20] that's you know
[31:23] for the believer there's not going to be
[31:25] no disappointments in hell that's right
[31:27] but for the unbeliever and the
[31:30] make-believer there's going to be some
[31:31] disappointments brother said there's
[31:33] going to be a lot of disappointments but
[31:36] the prize is not going to be
[31:37] disappointed
[31:39] she's been appointed to possess this
[31:42] land that's right
[31:44] in a time of recession
[31:46] God has given us the power to possess
[31:49] right
[31:51] we're not in a recession the bride's not
[31:53] in a recession
[31:55] he don't want us to poor mouth and
[31:57] meaning God has given us everything like
[32:00] I was talking to brother Donnie what
[32:01] more can he do he give us eternal life
[32:03] what greater blessing can you give us
[32:06] brother Gabriel
[32:07] go buy me some go down there at Walmart
[32:10] CVS see if he got appeal see if they got
[32:13] a shot
[32:15] you can't get it
[32:16] it's a gift he's give to the believer
[32:19] it's his very life
[32:21] see Satan can't take that away from us
[32:23] but a lot of times we we get discouraged
[32:25] and we doubt in the promises of God
[32:29] when we ought to be encouraged in the
[32:31] promises of God right amen I like what
[32:34] he said
[32:34] what he said to Joshua he gave him a
[32:37] commission too
[32:39] over in Joshua chapter 1. verse 9. see
[32:43] just because he just showing he wasn't a
[32:45] respected person
[32:47] he gave Moses a commission that he
[32:50] promised him he'd do and here he's
[32:53] promising he says the same thing almost
[32:55] the same thing to to Joshua in chapter
[32:58] chapter one verse now he says have not I
[33:01] commanded thee it's not the word of God
[33:04] commanded us this day that we live in
[33:08] it's not this message commanded us what
[33:11] to do that's it now give us the
[33:13] blueprint on how to live a Christian
[33:15] Life
[33:16] he said be strong and of good courage Be
[33:20] not Afraid neither be thou dismayed for
[33:24] the Lord thy God
[33:26] is with thee with orsoever thou knows
[33:30] and David said oh though I make my bed
[33:33] in hell you'll never leave what about
[33:36] the bride yeah let's enlarged herself
[33:38] sure we're walking amongst it now what
[33:42] do you think this is brother says it's
[33:43] Atomic father
[33:46] but I'm so thankful this morning that we
[33:47] can realize who we are and we need to
[33:49] get in our position Amen
[33:52] Let us be strong
[33:55] and of a good courage Don't Be Afraid
[33:58] these things have not come over over on
[34:00] us by surprise of the the world's
[34:03] surprise at this how can this happen
[34:05] everything everything I banked on I put
[34:08] all this and I put all my goodies in
[34:09] this in this account and I I had
[34:12] everything my retirement plan everything
[34:13] here I've lost it all
[34:16] the panicking
[34:19] but we don't have to panic all right
[34:22] we've read them the book God said I'll
[34:25] never leave thee not forsake the hell
[34:27] he'd be with even in the
[34:29] to the end
[34:30] to the end
[34:32] to the end and it can't live
[34:34] no not one place in here have I ever
[34:37] seen him lie
[34:39] not one place in here have I ever seen
[34:41] him not back his word up amen right
[34:44] right he's so sure of his word that he
[34:47] said heavens and earth will pass away
[34:49] but my word will never pass
[34:51] and I like the way David grabbed that
[34:55] hid Thy word in my heart that I sin not
[34:58] against them and look at job you know
[35:01] Joe went through a great try he didn't
[35:03] ask for
[35:07] asked him said now Joe we know you're a
[35:10] secret sinner
[35:11] you've done something you had to the
[35:14] Lord would not allow this see they
[35:16] didn't understand God had to bring God
[35:18] has to get us get our attention
[35:20] sometimes to show us Revelation to show
[35:23] us what we need to do sometimes he just
[35:25] has to get us in a place where we can
[35:27] meet Steve that's right and know that
[35:29] he's gone
[35:30] instead of trying to figure everything
[35:32] out for himself and they all had lots of
[35:35] good words to say
[35:37] but he said God come down said who's man
[35:40] they give me counsel who is man who
[35:43] where were you Joe who told me how to
[35:45] hang those stars who told me where to
[35:47] put them in who told me how to separate
[35:50] the water from the earth who told me
[35:53] what man showed me who did I need to get
[35:57] intelligence from
[35:58] no we all just put all of our confidence
[36:00] in God
[36:02] you realize he's able to keep us able to
[36:05] keep us not like job here he is in verse
[36:07] Chapter 30 verse 16 he said oh now my
[36:11] soul is poured out upon me and the days
[36:15] of my Affliction have taken hold upon me
[36:18] that's what happens to a lot of us
[36:21] our Affliction takes a hold upon us see
[36:24] when I had that when I had that I was
[36:27] like when I had to have a surgery on my
[36:29] foot
[36:29] and that my toe it got such in such a
[36:32] bad shape that Affliction brother and
[36:34] had took a hold on me
[36:36] it took a hold on me but God was saying
[36:38] will you stand on my word Satan was
[36:41] telling me it don't matter what you're
[36:43] gonna wait what you did you suffered for
[36:45] 10 years with it it ain't gonna get
[36:47] better you've had surgery before it
[36:50] didn't work this ain't gonna work either
[36:53] but the Bible said I'm the Lord my God
[36:55] the human thing and he tried to
[36:58] discourage he tried to discourage The
[37:00] credibility of the word
[37:02] that's what he tries to do tries to
[37:05] discourage The credibility of the word
[37:08] the word has a credibility it's the
[37:11] king's word all right what does King
[37:14] saying he means it that's right and here
[37:16] fulfill every bit of it and the prophet
[37:18] God said he'll bankrupt heaven doesn't
[37:21] feel they were promised to his believers
[37:24] in the reflection and they're getting it
[37:26] says well look at how you
[37:29] are you here it is seven weeks later
[37:30] than that
[37:31] that thing hit fell off it was a big old
[37:33] black Ultra thing on my toe about the
[37:36] size of the quarter as thick as a nickel
[37:37] says it still ain't gonna get better I
[37:39] told you
[37:40] I said what the word of God said
[37:43] I am the Lord thy God the healeth thee
[37:45] right amen and I begin to rub that thing
[37:47] before I went back to work and I said
[37:48] Lord
[37:49] I know you're healed because you
[37:51] wouldn't have allowed this and you
[37:52] wouldn't have made a way for me to get
[37:53] the surgical see it's crooked the
[37:56] insurance companies are crooked amen
[37:59] and they try to discourage you oh yes
[38:04] that first thing they told me it was
[38:05] cosmetic
[38:11] I might need one but I'm not getting one
[38:15] I said I'm having to have surgery this
[38:18] thing is causing me to walk out of
[38:20] balance right
[38:22] see we need to walk in the balance of
[38:24] the message that's what's wrong many
[38:26] people have took the message and got it
[38:28] out of balance
[38:30] that's why they can't walk like a
[38:31] Christian they can't think like a
[38:33] Christian they can't live like a
[38:34] Christian right right well
[38:37] so there's no way
[38:39] and then you get to that place and you
[38:41] say Lord look you're slay me and I trust
[38:44] you you're right that's when The
[38:46] Showdown comes that's right this is
[38:48] Showdown my brothers and sisters now
[38:50] begin to rub on that thing one day
[38:53] I began to rub that thing I said Lord I
[38:56] need this thing to come off and you said
[38:58] in your word and that thing just fell
[39:00] off one week
[39:05] 's like a brand new like a brand new toe
[39:07] now some new skin that kind of stroll up
[39:10] look like a tomato
[39:11] I said my goodness Satan see that I'm
[39:14] Gonna Take It I'm gonna take your foot
[39:16] I'm gonna take you see he keeps telling
[39:18] and trying to describe but God said he'd
[39:20] do it I said Lord I know you created an
[39:22] ankle bone
[39:25] what is too hard for you Lord he takes
[39:29] you back the scripture the Lord said
[39:30] then I tell Abraham is anything too hard
[39:33] for God
[39:34] nothing nothing's too hard for God even
[39:37] my head's too big and these glasses are
[39:39] too small amen
[39:43] well I'm so thankful to God and we don't
[39:45] really we don't have to get into it
[39:48] discouragement
[39:50] Elijah here he had the greatest Showdown
[39:54] see he had a great Showdown he defeated
[39:56] all them false prophets
[39:58] and then one woman be running he had
[40:00] crime because that Norton lasting see
[40:04] that Norton brings boldness right it
[40:07] brings boy it brings courage
[40:10] but see we still got to have courage
[40:11] without the anointing right we got to
[40:13] say God we're trusting your word you
[40:15] promised it yes right because we will
[40:18] realize we can't operate through the
[40:19] senses
[40:21] when I feel it I believe it that don't
[40:24] always happen that's right that's what I
[40:26] don't feel and I still believe that amen
[40:29] but I don't seem God move I still
[40:31] believe it but my prayers get all high
[40:33] in this ceiling I still believe it
[40:35] but God said if I'd ask anything
[40:38] according to his will right
[40:42] amen
[40:44] amen here's Elijah run off scare the one
[40:48] little woman I'm gonna kill him he
[40:50] killed all my boss Robin here's this
[40:52] whole loud mouth Jezebel all painted up
[40:54] the prophet of God runs from her
[40:57] eyes down and he said well I'm gonna I'm
[40:59] on a comfort over Elijah I'm gonna send
[41:02] the Ravens I'm going to send the Ravens
[41:04] to feed it because I know he's I know
[41:06] he's hungry I'm gonna let him sit right
[41:08] here at this Brook chair with I'm gonna
[41:10] let him drink till this water runs out
[41:12] see Ahab didn't have that assurance
[41:15] that's right he didn't have that
[41:17] Assurance
[41:17] he was wondering where he was watering
[41:20] his next meeting
[41:21] but God still don't have to worry about
[41:23] that he said I'll provide everything
[41:25] I provided it according to my riches not
[41:28] Obama's right
[41:30] bankrupt
[41:36] and here he began to drink and again
[41:38] that run out
[41:40] I bet Manor said oh my Lord and this
[41:42] Satan probably tried telling wealth
[41:44] Elijah see there are you didn't believe
[41:46] God he's mad at you again the water
[41:49] Creek's dried up Raiders ain't bringing
[41:52] nothing else to eat
[41:53] the Lord spoke into the eyes I have
[41:56] talked to a little woman and she'll
[42:00] sustained me that's right see God works
[42:02] on both ends Right
[42:04] Here Comes this woman walking up here
[42:07] comes him walking up here's this woman
[42:08] he said woman what are you gonna do he
[42:11] said I'm going to make this location me
[42:14] and my son's gonna eat it now right so
[42:17] here I hope was gone too but see God's
[42:19] working on both ends he wanted he said
[42:20] this one was been true to me right she
[42:23] stood on my word
[42:24] she's probably getting a little skirts
[42:26] because she heard her boy crying his
[42:28] stomach hurt he was hungry
[42:30] he was in man
[42:32] a lot of times we see things happen to
[42:33] our families and
[42:35] discourages us see God had a promise
[42:38] I'll never leave it I'll never saved it
[42:41] hey he was four days late but he's still
[42:44] on time right they thought he was late
[42:47] if you'd have been here Lord oh I was
[42:50] here I knew he's gonna die but for his
[42:53] glory I wanted to show you I wanted to
[42:55] get away from all your superstitions so
[42:57] I'm gonna let him lay there four days
[43:00] I was eating the Jews talking about
[43:01] three days it's still the spirit still
[43:03] that didn't come back up in it so he
[43:04] said I'll just break down let you know
[43:06] there's nothing but the power of God so
[43:08] that fourth day he come see but this
[43:11] woman does he look like here you got a
[43:14] little bit of oil
[43:15] additional one
[43:17] he said go get me a drink she said all
[43:19] right what about that guy still had
[43:21] water in it he still had water for her
[43:23] see that but it was hungry still so you
[43:26] can go longer without food and you can't
[43:28] water right this bite is over 90 water
[43:31] in other words remember I said we're not
[43:33] but much matters were all we've been
[43:34] eating I can tell that but
[43:44] then he spoke these words you know why
[43:46] didn't promise amongst them said we
[43:48] really wouldn't know that he you know
[43:50] God had to tell her that this was my my
[43:52] servant this is my private because he
[43:54] said go make me a cake first
[43:56] a lot of women a lot of dads were saying
[44:00] what my boy's dying this is all I got
[44:03] you want me to go make you wanna we
[44:05] ain't gonna eat them
[44:07] they said go make me a cake first see
[44:09] obedience to the word that rhymes never
[44:12] promised okay right that's right and she
[44:14] obeyed what the prophet said dude that's
[44:15] what's happened around the message A lot
[44:17] of people are starting to disobey the
[44:18] prophet's work it's not what he really
[44:20] didn't mean that
[44:22] you didn't
[44:23] why do you say it why do you say it
[44:28] I didn't think the way I see it oh well
[44:31] that's all right
[44:32] I just say it like he said it and you
[44:34] know what I don't even understand it but
[44:35] I believe it
[44:37] but I believe
[44:39] I believe it's the truth see she had to
[44:42] believe she didn't understand I bet she
[44:43] didn't understand go make me a cake you
[44:46] sure I mean she thought maybe a little
[44:48] bit of myself well all right went down
[44:50] there and made him a cake and brung it
[44:51] to him
[44:52] went down there and went back in there
[44:54] that was enough for them again and then
[44:56] every day him and her him
[44:59] she didn't go to provide we don't have
[45:02] to worry about it we don't depend on our
[45:03] brain camp right depend on my heavily
[45:06] account right you know what I got a
[45:08] check I can cash in
[45:10] it's already been signed All I gotta do
[45:12] is fill it out
[45:13] it says Jesus Christ down there yeah
[45:15] it's already been approved all I gotta
[45:19] do is believe it he said wait a minute I
[45:20] didn't get what I asked for today it's
[45:22] coming it's coming
[45:25] it's kind of what I don't feel no better
[45:27] oh it's coming I didn't feel a little
[45:29] better that didn't mean that he said
[45:31] you're going to stick to my word right
[45:32] right are you going to lead to your
[45:34] senses are they going to trust in your
[45:36] senses are you going to believe in my
[45:37] word I'm leaving you worried
[45:40] these senses failed me many times yes
[45:43] you know many people's cried many people
[45:46] shouted many people spoke with tongues
[45:48] but they didn't have the goodies that's
[45:49] right because when the time come in for
[45:51] the test of time they left
[45:53] he said they were judged for a while at
[45:54] your seat he said but when
[45:57] my son came in to bake out the greenness
[46:00] they weren't able to withstanding they
[46:02] withered away
[46:04] because it had no root really Aaron had
[46:07] no heart to receive it thank God we got
[46:10] a heart this morning to received amen
[46:13] we don't need to give in
[46:15] James said here's the key now James
[46:18] chapter 4 verse 7 he says submit
[46:20] yourselves therefore to God
[46:22] he didn't say resistance
[46:25] to submit yourself to no man
[46:28] right submit yourself to no certain
[46:30] Doctrine
[46:32] he said submit yourselves therefore to
[46:35] God he said resist the devil
[46:37] amen and he'll flee we forgot we forgot
[46:41] to read the end of it resist the devil
[46:44] and he'll flee when he comes in with his
[46:47] tool of discouragement resist him
[46:51] say God has given me joy God has given
[46:55] me peace God has given me rest
[46:58] I'm resting as Paul Rayner said I'm
[47:01] riding on it this morning I'm riding on
[47:04] this message
[47:05] I've tried for many times in the flesh
[47:08] we've tried to we've tried to we tried
[47:10] to wrestle that log in
[47:12] and get in the flow with God but he said
[47:15] just roll it in there Paul
[47:17] get on it and ride
[47:19] that's all we have to do says no it's no
[47:22] fleshly thinking we do to gain this
[47:26] within our flesh can we do to gain this
[47:30] Psalms 105
[47:32] verse 2 says singing to the Lord sing
[47:35] unto him sing songs unto him talk give
[47:38] his wondrous words and see Satan during
[47:41] the time when he puts these things off
[47:43] he tries to get to the place to be
[47:45] discouraged and say well you know Satan
[47:47] tries to single yet well you know he let
[47:48] nobody else go through this
[47:50] oh yeah really
[47:52] really you think you're the only one
[47:55] that's ever done today read the Bible
[47:58] all of them was chasing and repeat right
[48:01] see it's building characters say we want
[48:04] Power without having to go through the
[48:06] trials and the heartaches to get
[48:08] character but Power without character
[48:11] said that you know what I'm thankful for
[48:14] that but he shouldn't power with
[48:15] character Fitzgerald see he's training
[48:18] us to be rulers
[48:21] we're not peasants we're rulers and he
[48:25] said casting down the imaginations and
[48:27] bringing every thought of The Obedience
[48:29] of Jesus Christ
[48:30] imaginations is what gets us in trouble
[48:33] that's what discourages because we look
[48:35] at we look at things and we think well
[48:37] it don't look no better
[48:39] faith is the sums of things hoped for
[48:41] right evidence of Things Not Seen he
[48:44] didn't say when you see it you believe
[48:45] see Thomas said if I see I believe but
[48:48] he said greater's the one that ain't
[48:49] seen and still believe that's right amen
[48:52] and sometimes we get to a place where we
[48:54] need to see it God will do it God will
[48:57] show us something that encourages us
[48:58] amen and I'm thankful for that we need
[49:00] to fight all this negativity around our
[49:03] life we live in a negative world
[49:06] they're all complaining oh murmuring you
[49:09] know what you'll get caught up in it
[49:10] you'll murmur and complain with them I
[49:12] did the Lord told me I said stop it
[49:15] stop it
[49:17] swirl
[49:19] the Lord rebuked me brother died I said
[49:22] all right Lord I'm sorry I did I
[49:24] shouldn't have did that right because he
[49:26] gets you caught up in politics that gets
[49:28] you caught up in this you know where you
[49:29] work at the Murman Murman you complain
[49:31] about not getting enough hours you're
[49:33] complain about this you complain about
[49:34] that and God said you know what I've
[49:35] done to the Israelites when they
[49:37] commemorate and complain
[49:39] they wandered around in the wilderness I
[49:41] think that's why we've teared so long
[49:43] we've murmured and complained too long
[49:45] it's time to just take God this word and
[49:48] say Lord be it unto me according to Thy
[49:51] word Lord I'm gonna quit murdering I'm
[49:53] gonna quit complaining yes I'm gonna
[49:55] quit trying to figure everything out for
[49:57] myself and just let you do it
[49:59] I'm gonna quit trying to accomplish
[50:01] everything
[50:02] and just let your word be bring it to
[50:04] pass
[50:06] we need to bring our thoughts on the
[50:07] obedience
[50:09] you know what that we can say
[50:13] bring ourselves under the announce
[50:15] that's anointing it's discouragement
[50:16] anointing but we can bring others on
[50:19] that and all
[50:20] I've seen it happen you get around
[50:22] people that's like brother Jewel said
[50:24] well how's your housing
[50:27] you know what you know man you can run
[50:28] him you'll be lousy wisely before you
[50:30] left well present I can tell where my
[50:32] kids go stay at oh yeah because the
[50:34] spirit they bring back home right amen
[50:36] so be careful who you who you make
[50:38] company with I mean we don't we're not
[50:41] mean to people we love them and I'm like
[50:43] well I'm not gonna get in there and jump
[50:44] in the boat with it just cause they're
[50:45] both sinking I'm not gonna get in there
[50:47] with them
[50:47] I'll say hey I got a promise Rapture I'm
[50:51] having the body changed hey I'm not
[50:54] gonna I'm not worried about what's
[50:55] happening here on this Earth that's just
[50:57] signs that tell me to look up not look
[51:00] down yeah
[51:01] that's what happened when the boy all
[51:02] the other boys couldn't win the thing
[51:04] for the bicycle the one boy got his eye
[51:06] on the prize and he kept riding the
[51:09] restaurants looking at oh I don't know
[51:10] if we can do it Peter did the same thing
[51:12] yeah when he got his eyes off Jesus
[51:15] that's what happens to us every time
[51:16] when we get our eyes off Jesus
[51:20] yeah Psalms
[51:22] chapter 3 verse 3 says but thou Lord
[51:25] a shield from me my glory and a lifter
[51:29] up of my head and he said when you see
[51:31] these things look up Don't look down
[51:34] your Redemption draws now amen we have
[51:37] to ask God in faith
[51:40] we must have faith in God we ask him for
[51:43] heaven no he'll do it
[51:45] appreciate it when the enemy had come in
[51:48] like a flood he'd raise up a standard
[51:52] the standard's the word it's not these
[51:55] is this
[51:57] right well we don't wrestle against
[51:59] flesh and blood amen against
[52:01] principality is a spiritual wickedness
[52:03] in high places
[52:04] the battlefield right there the man
[52:07] Satan gets in there and they just
[52:10] but you know what I like what the
[52:12] prophet said he said I'm getting to the
[52:13] place
[52:14] to where I'm doubting my doubts glory to
[52:18] God that's where I want to get I don't
[52:22] want to get to the place where I'm at my
[52:24] doubts
[52:25] that's when you know that God is real
[52:29] he said be certain of God and know that
[52:32] he's real right he said you must make
[52:35] you call an election sure
[52:37] oh I'm thankful for that ain't you oh I
[52:40] love him love him for his grace and
[52:42] mercy turn with me to the Book of Romans
[52:45] I think a lot of times when getting
[52:47] discouraged because of the things we
[52:50] think we should we can accomplish
[52:52] because we've been in the message so
[52:53] long we can accomplish it through the
[52:55] flesh I think that's what brings a lot
[52:57] of us discouragement on us
[52:59] just a few minutes I won't keep you much
[53:01] lower
[53:02] amen
[53:04] Romans chapter 10 I'm sorry about that
[53:07] my eyes ain't what they used to be my
[53:09] wife says I need to get my eyes checked
[53:11] but I I'm saying Lord you didn't let
[53:13] Martin Luther's eyes go in there
[53:15] I'm gonna believe anyway so I have to
[53:17] know
[53:19] Romans 10 3 6 4 they being ignorant of
[53:24] God's righteousness I believe a lot of
[53:26] times we're really we don't really
[53:28] understand the righteousness of God
[53:29] right amen this is being ignorant of
[53:32] God's righteousness and going about to
[53:35] establish their own righteousness
[53:38] have not submitted themselves unto the
[53:40] righteousness of God
[53:43] and it's not my fleshly works that we
[53:44] can do
[53:45] I like you you know there's above charge
[53:48] this is a very serious charge
[53:51] he charged them with the Israelites had
[53:55] followed after the law of righteousness
[54:00] and they realized they had what they
[54:01] were to keep the law brother
[54:03] they failed it
[54:05] they weren't able to obtain the law they
[54:07] tried their best
[54:09] and it becomes so much trouble to become
[54:11] a do and it don't
[54:12] a lot of people I believe they let this
[54:14] message become dudes and don'ts to them
[54:17] come on now
[54:20] he said we see therefore they had no
[54:22] righteousness
[54:23] brother Donnie we have no righteousness
[54:27] but they were not submitting themselves
[54:29] to receding the gift of righteousness
[54:31] that was being offered
[54:34] they weren't going to submit themselves
[54:35] to this man who called himself Jesus
[54:38] me and my father are one
[54:41] when you've seen me you're seeing the
[54:42] father no way you're an illegitimate all
[54:45] right
[54:48] but
[54:50] oh they wouldn't accept it they as we do
[54:53] so many times
[54:56] do not realize that they
[54:58] were totally
[55:00] and thoroughly deprived creatures by
[55:04] Nature
[55:04] we got to realize that we are the prime
[55:07] creatures by name this name I'm talking
[55:09] about the flesh nature now not the
[55:10] spirit we've got all things through
[55:12] Christ Jesus right but they didn't
[55:14] realize to this nature this the the sin
[55:16] in the garden
[55:18] tonight and implanted himself
[55:20] in there and to give us the wrong nature
[55:24] we see man is in such a condition that
[55:26] he cannot be saved through his struggles
[55:28] to keep the holy standard of God's law
[55:31] no matter that's what they think about
[55:33] this world you know our business I ain't
[55:35] cut my hair I'm still wondering what
[55:36] about the lion
[55:38] the life of God that's right
[55:41] right he'll never attain it by those
[55:43] things that's right right I don't care
[55:45] how long we've been in this message
[55:46] unless we've been born again we'll fail
[55:48] right but before man will submit and
[55:52] Trust in the righteousness of God it has
[55:55] to be proven to him or her that our life
[55:58] in the flesh is a demonstrated failure
[56:03] it's a failure
[56:05] that's right Paul said the life I live
[56:07] now right I live through Christ Jesus
[56:10] amen amen it's a new life
[56:13] I believe many times we as message
[56:15] believers
[56:16] today are not exempt from needing this
[56:19] proof
[56:20] for sometimes for some of us it seems
[56:24] that we have more defeat and lost
[56:26] battles and less Victory than we ever
[56:29] have
[56:31] something to think about brothers and
[56:32] sisters
[56:36] discouragement seems to have come back
[56:39] upon us with a Vengeance that's why we
[56:41] see so many people falling away
[56:43] discouragement has come on them see they
[56:46] failed to be borned again all right
[56:48] that's what happened to me
[56:50] when I was raising the Smith I thought
[56:52] because Mom and Daddy had it I'd be all
[56:55] right
[56:56] but God don't have no grandchildren
[56:58] right
[57:00] he had Sons and Daughters right the
[57:03] source of producing discouragement
[57:06] the producing this discouragement the
[57:09] center around the Fleshlight well this
[57:12] place Paul said when I go to do good he
[57:13] was always present he wasn't talking
[57:14] about you with his brother he wasn't
[57:17] talking about Peter he wasn't talking
[57:18] about John he wasn't talking about Mark
[57:19] he wasn't talking about Silas something
[57:22] like this
[57:25] regret said you'll never perfect him
[57:27] he's a cockleberry all you can do is
[57:30] Bridle him with the Holy Ghost
[57:32] that's the truth
[57:35] it seems that the righteousness we have
[57:38] clothed not all of us we have been
[57:41] clothed with it's being Stripped Away
[57:43] see Satan tearing down trusting in the
[57:45] righteousness of God
[57:47] right let us he's trying to turn us back
[57:49] to the mall back to the keeper of this
[57:52] to be able to keep this message through
[57:55] a flesh really outward thing to do but
[57:58] we can't do it this flesh can't keep it
[58:01] it's felt he said he gives so many
[58:03] covenants and they fail you do this I'll
[58:07] do that
[58:08] he blew it right blew it every time
[58:11] we're blowing it now if we think we can
[58:12] do it that way that's right
[58:15] they've Satan places to thought a lot of
[58:17] us
[58:18] trying to get you to disbelieve in your
[58:20] birth
[58:21] yeah am I really born again you're right
[58:23] come on now you wouldn't have done that
[58:26] been a really bad Christian right see I
[58:29] said Satan you tricked me
[58:31] you tricked me I didn't do that the
[58:33] flesh did this Spirit In Me
[58:35] it's the same Spirit of living me live
[58:37] in Christ Jesus well let me he'll
[58:39] Quicken this Mortal body I said but I
[58:42] have a god in me that condemns me when I
[58:44] make mistakes and I'm able to go to him
[58:46] and I say Lord forgive me they stop by
[58:48] the outward place that we can do
[58:51] the life we live now is through Christ
[58:53] Jesus not through this man
[58:59] am I really elect
[59:01] have I really been born again
[59:05] I tell you how you can answer that
[59:07] question as the prophet said the woman
[59:08] said but Brandon I'm wondering if I have
[59:10] the Holy Ghost
[59:12] he said sister what is your heart's
[59:14] desire see Satan I want to tell you that
[59:16] it says to serve God has been loving
[59:19] with all I he says sister
[59:22] God still got you he said when you lose
[59:25] that desire when we ask that what the
[59:27] problem is a lot of people think well
[59:29] you know they try to justify their sins
[59:32] that goes over like a label there is no
[59:34] justice
[59:36] we broke the law so there's a penalty
[59:39] right right and Jesus had to pay that
[59:41] price or me and you would have paid for
[59:42] it
[59:43] but I'm thankful that God has paid the
[59:45] price for us
[59:48] I'm like what Jesus said in Saint John 6
[59:51] chapter 30 verse Saint John's chapter 6
[59:55] verse 37 he says all
[59:58] that the father giveth me shall come to
[1:00:00] me right and him that cometh to me I
[1:00:04] will in no wise cast out
[1:00:06] we must trust him we must believe in
[1:00:11] that this must become a personal
[1:00:12] revelation to you amen not just because
[1:00:15] your pastor said it or the Evangel said
[1:00:17] it's going to be a personal relationship
[1:00:19] to you he is proving to us that there is
[1:00:23] no good thing in our flesh what did Paul
[1:00:25] say in Romans 8 17 he says and if
[1:00:28] children then hairs hairs of God John
[1:00:32] heirs with Christ and show me that we
[1:00:34] suffer with him that we may be also
[1:00:37] glorified together
[1:00:39] this Revelation is important because it
[1:00:42] will keep us from trusting in the flesh
[1:00:45] and the law and keep us turned to Christ
[1:00:48] that's the only hope we have in Christ
[1:00:51] Jesus the only hope we have is in Christ
[1:00:53] Jesus that's right no other hope that we
[1:00:56] have right amen not like what the
[1:00:58] prophet of God said he said in one place
[1:01:00] he said and even even your members of
[1:01:03] your family
[1:01:05] I'm trying to discourage
[1:01:07] he said they'll try to discourage you
[1:01:09] more than ever
[1:01:11] he uses
[1:01:14] you know what the joke wife say
[1:01:16] Joe
[1:01:19] he's give up on you job he don't even
[1:01:21] love you no more Joe he said now
[1:01:27] he slay me and I trust him see we got to
[1:01:31] make our call in an election shortly I
[1:01:32] like what Paul said in Galatians 5 4 he
[1:01:34] says Christ has become no effect unto
[1:01:37] you whosoever of you are justified by
[1:01:40] the law you're falling from Grace
[1:01:43] so see we're trying to justify our life
[1:01:45] as message believed God tell us about
[1:01:46] what we've done the outward works it's
[1:01:49] an inwardness right that brings forth
[1:01:51] that outward manifestation
[1:01:53] see it's not to help with things we've
[1:01:55] done it's the inward thing he did amen
[1:01:57] right it's his blood tag
[1:02:02] our faith will not and cannot rest
[1:02:04] fully immigration to
[1:02:08] entice In the Flesh yes Philippians 3 3
[1:02:11] says for a we are the circumcision which
[1:02:14] worship God in spirit and rejoice in
[1:02:16] Christ Jesus
[1:02:18] and have no confidence in the flesh
[1:02:22] right no not for this in the flesh
[1:02:26] what does turning from law and Grace
[1:02:28] consists of does it mean that when we
[1:02:31] turn from long grace to the extent that
[1:02:33] we are no longer concerned about keeping
[1:02:35] the law no
[1:02:37] no they don't mean that
[1:02:39] we must apply all our strength toward
[1:02:42] keeping it but when we fail we're not to
[1:02:45] suppose we're falling from Grace
[1:02:48] see Satan wants you to think that right
[1:02:50] that's the second we tell you if you was
[1:02:51] a Christian you wouldn't have done it he
[1:02:52] just wanted to deny the grace of God the
[1:02:55] blood the atonement
[1:02:58] we fall from grace when we suppose that
[1:03:01] our efforts to keep it justifies us
[1:03:06] there's the heavy hitter
[1:03:08] he says keep him below
[1:03:11] faith in Christ having kept the law is
[1:03:14] our justification turning from the law
[1:03:16] to Grace means that we refuse to trust
[1:03:18] in our ability to keep the law through
[1:03:21] the flesh when sons and daughters are
[1:03:23] led by the spirit of God
[1:03:27] it says our ability to keep the law as a
[1:03:30] way of Salvation the truth is that law
[1:03:32] and Grace work together
[1:03:34] to bring about our Salvation we're not
[1:03:37] supposed to
[1:03:39] to one another to be we're supposed to
[1:03:41] come they're supposed to compliment one
[1:03:43] another they're not supposed to be
[1:03:44] opposed to one another
[1:03:46] they're supposed to compliment one
[1:03:48] another
[1:03:50] we see the law says faith says forth
[1:03:54] God's standard of Holiness and I believe
[1:03:56] in wholeness brothers and sisters I
[1:03:58] believe a lot of people in the message
[1:04:00] that forgot about Holiness
[1:04:01] we see the skirts and the high-heeled
[1:04:04] shoes and the the trimming their hairs
[1:04:06] again the split tails and they said what
[1:04:09] the Scandal skirts are coming back baby
[1:04:10] now my wife showed me in the paper the
[1:04:13] other day they're gonna be a big head
[1:04:15] again you know the problems talked about
[1:04:16] it it's kind of experience
[1:04:19] showing us that same old dad was raise a
[1:04:22] recycler
[1:04:23] he cycles that Spirit right back around
[1:04:28] see it
[1:04:29] shows forth his righteousness and
[1:04:32] Perfection it cannot be turned away from
[1:04:34] its perfection
[1:04:36] and for that reason it cannot forgive
[1:04:39] its violators
[1:04:41] the law convinced Grace forgives right
[1:04:45] yes Romans 8 3 4 what the law could not
[1:04:49] do
[1:04:50] and that it was weak through the flesh
[1:04:53] see the flesh was weak
[1:04:55] they couldn't do it see there had to be
[1:04:57] a spirit of life to be able to keep the
[1:05:00] law in there see right that's where the
[1:05:02] Sadducees and Pharisees messed up they
[1:05:04] tried to do it without what works we've
[1:05:06] kept the Sabbath we've done this we wash
[1:05:08] our hands
[1:05:09] we do this
[1:05:11] will not be a fornication he said you're
[1:05:13] of your father the devil and here's what
[1:05:16] she'll do he said you blind leaders of
[1:05:19] the blind
[1:05:20] don't you know he told naked women she
[1:05:23] must be born again
[1:05:27] he says it was weak to the flesh God
[1:05:30] sending his own son in the likeness of
[1:05:32] sinful flesh and for sin condemned sin
[1:05:37] in the flesh glory be to God he
[1:05:40] condemned mine in your sin in his flesh
[1:05:44] he showed that it had to be a perfect
[1:05:47] sacrifice yes that's right I mean he was
[1:05:50] it failed not through any flaw in it the
[1:05:54] law fell
[1:05:56] but though through the weakness of our
[1:05:59] flesh the law fellow for us we failed
[1:06:02] the law
[1:06:03] strive as we made
[1:06:06] perfectly
[1:06:07] the Lord declares that if it
[1:06:11] we're guilty as if we've broken the
[1:06:14] whole law and we say oh I never did this
[1:06:17] I never lied I never done this I never
[1:06:19] done that he was born the wrong way
[1:06:22] right you lied when your mama caught you
[1:06:25] in the cookie jar you lied
[1:06:28] you little white lies you didn't think
[1:06:30] me nothing they was lies
[1:06:32] there is no such thing as a white lie
[1:06:34] they're all black
[1:06:36] and his sight you know
