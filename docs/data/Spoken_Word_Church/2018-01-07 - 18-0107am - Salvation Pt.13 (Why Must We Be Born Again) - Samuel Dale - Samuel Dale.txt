we've never walked this way before so helpless as it says in the scripture - pull up tight together and to walk in your grace in order to see because we know that someone has already made this journey for us because it was you Lord that made it in human flesh upon the earth to walk to the place to work you could come to a change and that's what we're doing Lord is walking in the light of your love we love you and we thank you forgive our sins cleanse us from all unrighteousness and bless us together in you in Jesus name Amen okay Jonah - because remember we're still on salvation but I will sacrifice unto thee with the voice of Thanksgiving I will pay that that I have vowed salvation is of the Lord all right now that delivers is what and the Lord spoken to the fish and it vomited out Jonah upon the dry and all right let's go to first Corinthians a very odd scripture but I'm pray that it will open up to word that we can see you know and right on down to where we're at okay so we're going to first Corinthians 15:44 now we're not going to get in to up in above it you know it's cholesterol and cholesterol and etc coming down we just start about verse 45 44 it is sown a natural body in his raised a spiritual body there is a natural body and there is a spiritual body and so it is written the first man Adam was what was made a living soul and the life Adam was made a quickening spirit now how be it that was not first which is spiritual it doesn't mean that Adam come before God or whatever it's just meaning you start with a natural that Adam was a living soul you start from that and then you go forwards alright so then what does he say how be it that was not first which is spiritual with that which is natural and afterward that which is spiritual the first man is of the earth earthy the second man is the Lord from heaven as is their earthy such are they also that are earthy we took on the natural thing just like Adam and time and as is the heavenly such are they also that are heavenly as we have borne the image of the earthy we shall also bear the image of the heavenly now this I say brethren that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God neither does corruption inherit incorruption you may be seated Lord that is blessing through the reading of the word now then we we know as I said the scripture said it wasn't and words which Adam came first the natural Adam that was made a living soul all right that was it then the second adam is the lord of glory okay all right so we'll get back to that in a minute in our talk and what we're trying to bring okay now we studied throughout the Old Testament of the plan of redemption for those people and we put this in every service because we don't want people to think that well we don't believe in this that or the other we believe in a plan of redemption in the Old Testament that was under the blood of bulls and goats all right and it was dire by faith in believing that it wasn't this you just went up flopped down a lamb no it was that you believe that lamb was taking your place so it's believing what was the salvation in the Old Testament a people believing in God it wasn't a matter of justification sanctification the baptism of the Holy Ghost and things like that that was not in the Old Testament it was the salvation and most of your linking to salvation was really natural al and the people were promised to Abraham in a land and it was promised him a seed alright because it was nothing back there in the form of salvation to bring you to eternal life or anything like that under that because Jesus Christ had not died yet alright see then knowing that we can see that salvation was based upon now this was the last message I didn't complete it but we will take it up the Lord will in the next service of more into believing and what it really means to be believing with those people back their salvation was not far everybody it was made for those that would believe all right now it's not that they couldn't receive it or whatever they do you know it was iron but it was believing not just to say believe that there was a God you know that was great but to believe for them was to believe that God was dealing with them personally all right now remember the thing that we've emphasized over and over whatever that you see in the Old Testament of salvation must be brought to the New Testament and not change that as being a dog and a cat over here and a horse over here or something but it's to have a greater value or what was revealed here our meaning salvation in the Old Testament then you come into the New Testament opens up into a a greater understanding of what God is trying to do all right now see then doing that then what was salvation based upon back there as I said it wasn't I've never believed it that you just go up and take a lamb won't flop it down and say there's a lamb I've done my deed no it was faith in God to believe that lamb was taking your place right and that whatever was wrong that lamb would take your place and and you know when God would be satisfied with what was being done so it was your faith in the fact that you believed in God and not just believe in a God or some God you know that wasn't what it was it was a belief in God Himself coming to you God spoke to Abraham and told him get up and go and he got him win they he was above all the other gods you know that tell him to do this or whatever he's this one began to talk to him about his life and what was going on all right now so then it's base-2 privation whether it be old our new testament it's based upon your believing your believing in God not in a God but in God of the word because we was reading the scripture writer they he that cometh to God and Hebrew must believe that he is right now is not not was that's fine our will be is fine but for right now so your salvation and not based upon a God of back Darth it's based upon God in you and I believe in right now all right bringing us to that place okay now we went through these scriptures you know to to cover it but just to review a second so we know that it says in Genesis now I love these because these to me I've always believed and tried to teach because I saw this in the Baptist Church of the scriptures that was there that we were the children of Abraham by faith there's not a natural Jew I wasn't trying to be a natural jus thought I knew the scripture is not a Jews would you out when Judas inwardly see meaning something had to happen all right but I've always believed that the Bible teaching that Abraham was the father of faith and it was so much related to Abraham until it would make him to her that the preparation for a place to go to would be called the bosom of Abraham now that's how much God thought about him and what he was doing but the scripture says in Genesis 16 and in 15 and 6 and he believed in the Lord and he counted it to him for righteousness in other words he believed in God and that brought his salvation are you in me abraham believed in God and that brought his salvation brought his deliverance brought his you know bringing him to a place they're calling him righteous what is the what is the point of righteousness the state of fact of being right aren't abraham believed God and God says that's right that's right you got it right and I'll make you just as righteous as I am because it would go from right to righteousness and going into the point all right then we come over to Roman's four and three for what says the scripture abraham believed god and it was counted unto him for righteousness holmen's for 21 and 22 and being fully persuaded that he had what he had promised he was able to perform and therefore it was imputed to him for righteousness he believed God and it was imputed unto inferences Galatians three and six even as abraham believed God and it was accounted to him for righteousness a lot of being said about this point of Abraham believing right James two and twenty three and the scripture was fulfilled which saith abraham believed God and it was imputed unto him for righteousness and he was called the friend of God now in knowing that then we see that a lot is related or it's all related to believe in he didn't say Abraham was just righteous and I chose him no it says abraham believed god now what if abraham hadn't believed god he wouldn't have said that is that sensible is that reasonable you know if he had to believe God God wouldn't would not have accepted him so then we can go back to predestination why does God do this why does God do that why does some come in and water some not come in we went through those things trying to define it to understand to see that God chose Abraham and what did the prophets say he said about he said I know Abraham will teach his children so then it goes automatically down to the genealogies of Abraham and his descendants coming down - Isaac - coming towards Christ all right now then knowing that we covered this and it's on the message are our sin Romans 4:16 that Abraham who is the father of us all now Abraham being the father of us all that's all of the seed of Abraham that's not all mankind he's not the father of all mankind and it's not in connected to all of his children remember we went through that Abraham had a bunch of boys but none of them was chosen for that lineage - Pais down spiritually speaking to go from one to the other except Isaac and Isaac would be a type of Christ all right and Abraham then would be the father of us all now I like that because it says in Genesis talking about says it Eve is the mother of all living we're quick to quote that that everything comes through the wound of Eve because she's a mother of all living but it doesn't say Adam is the father of all living because that would have made two genealogies and messed up but it says in this situation here coming to the New Testament form - look at it it said Abraham is the father of us all not all the world not all the people what is he the father of the faith seed not a natural seed not natural genealogies he's the father of the faith seed right he's the father other children of God no no Jesus is my father see you're not listening you're not paying attention to what was being done all right now listen so then the first man Adam first christen we just read was made a living soul all right now the second Adam was made a quickening spirit the god of glory so the first man Adam now was a living soul the first one that come into being in the Bible terminologies of talking about a living soul was Adam right Adam came into the world or living so God breathed into his nostrils and he became a living soul now what I love about that is what I've tried to keep you to you know get you to always remember that according to the prophet in blasphemous names that God breathed especially into Adam eternal life and made him an eternal person he says with God huh what do we believe that no no no he would just maybe eat no because he was the first of that generation or that genealogy are that coming forth of mankind was Adam why would he not start with eternal life in his soul we get his body his spirit would have been not eternal all right why would that not be a beautiful situation to bring it down then from Adam and being the first Adam and then Jesus being the second Adam or the Lord of glory and how that he would start his life you remember that the other day we're trying to emphasize it sees in the Lord Jesus when he came he was body of flesh not eternal soul and spirit being Almighty God eternal he's our second Adam huh see the first atom eternal life in his soul the first beginning of mankind was the way God wanted it right is that that a sensible thought the way he wanted mankind he made Adam that mankind all right because he knew that story and he knew how it was going to come all right but that was the way he made him and like I've always tried to get you I've always preached it this away for 50 years nearly that Adam was God's example and he gave him eternal life in his soul but his body was not eternal yet if he'd have stayed in that position without sin the Prophet said his youth was being renewed daily everything was running great there was no time there was no CN there was no nothing it was a beautiful situation and what if he'd have stayed that way and seeing it not entered the picture then would not we have come as the children of God through Adam and Eve bringing the Word of God speaking it and it bring it into manifestation and then we could have all went to the tree of life because the Bible speaks of it being there all right then we could have all been made eternal well what's the difference it's not that what God is still it does that strike you is not that what God is doing he comes in his you eternal life in your soul making you a child of God he starts working out through the spirit back out into the flesh to try to bring us back to where Adam was right and there comes the Lord Jesus to show that it could be done because he was the beginning of the creation of God revelation 3:14 alright that was not God dis rework in a human race Jesus was not God this coming from man he didn't come from man he come by creation like the first Adam Cain the first Adam came by creation into life the second Adam came by creation not by sexual intercourse or anything they just barred the world or that it would come forth and be kinfolks to you and I but then was set forth in Jesus Christ what he wants mankind to be now and he's not that - way as I said there it is being done he gives us a new birth that puts eternal life in our soul and he's working on us to bring us to a change of the body and see then that when that takes place you'll have it back the way Adam was because now listen you go into adoption we'll get into that in a different thing Adam was ruler of the earth Adam was brethren said God of the earth right he said that's what he wants his children to be within it was an example but by the fall coming into being it took us into a position that we couldn't do it so he had to come himself to pay the price to set it up and he would be called the beginning of the creation of God that would be God in human flesh showing what he desired to be in the beginning but Adam lost that part the one Adam lost there what did the prophets say Jesus Christ restored so he's gonna restore sonship I was looking at one this morning there were utterance that he said that's what happened to Adam he said he lost his God shield I like that he said he lost his God because he was the god of the earth what about being able to name all the animals and do all of those things we'll see that was what God wanted that's what God wants now on what's going to be brother Dale to bring us to a change of the body somebody he's gonna have to come back where Adam was the god of the earth now then but one way to do that and that's through Jesus Christ there's not a way of us working ourselves back to some form of a utopia of life or whatever it would be to bring no it's one simple time you must be born again and we're starting the New Testament of the thought now you must be born again what I want to ask the question because I want it in a question or form to you why must we be born again now come on we Baptists we taught that you must be born again now when I get to it I want to read some things but around that said about the new birth and what but I was looking at one and it's letting on my desk now and I would ask you to read okay you always want me to tell you something to do and whatever or listen to the tape there's a tape called key to the door starts it okay key to the door it's just one statement part comes out are pretty good paragraph but if you'll read that you'll hear it then next go to a statue of a perfect man in the next go to blasphemous names there's one more in between I'll get it later but you've got enough diary you got three messages especially listened to stature of a perfect man and then listen to blasphemous names because we want to get into that later into what we're talking about because you're getting into restoration and understanding it all right then you'll begin to see why brother Branham would make statements that he made and he'd say I can't elusively prove by this picture that you're born again but you're believing on Jesus Christ and then you're baptized into the body by the baptism with a hole to go but now the statement that I want you to think about that he said he said there's eleven hundred and something different denominations or something to this degree now paraphrasing it a little bit and he says there's 11 107 something different ways that man teaches of the new birth now that's his word he says they they've teach each church teaches its own way of being born again he said they have some good things and he said I don't argue with him about their points but he said they've got eleven hundred and seven different ways of being born again well may I had about two thousand in this message of the way the message people teach the new birth are the born-again experience or whatever we're going to make it so simple until when we begin to think about it we're going to start like this we're gonna say the day you believe you start your salvation the day you believe then it'll have to go on from there okay all right now watch what we're getting at so then the first man Adam was made a living soul okay the second Adam was made a quickening spirit see now we're so quick to to be so revel a 'td until we'll jump onto something and when it says now the first was not spiritual the first was natural he's talking about a living soul Adam was naturally made a living soul all right Lucy was a but but he was a spirit first he well he was a son of God he would see we've got it so great until we don't listen to the simplicity of things to follow it we've got to see like you say like saying there now the Bible says it was not the first that was spiritual but was natural but further Dale the Prophet told that Adam you know he would have been spiritually inside of him and he was the son of God see instead of listening to the point that the Scriptures saying it doesn't matter what Adam was before he was he came to be in physical form a son of God so the first man Adam was a living soul whatever you want to think of what he was back here whatever just remember that was put in to a human element called Adam and he would have been the first Adam because he would have been the first to the human race then Jesus Christ would be the first of this new race that is not the old race done over among quoting from the church age book and the thought it's not Jesus Christ wasn't just some old race done over that's why the new birth is not just an old race of people done over it's a complete new race Jesus started a total new race all right and then he the first message he preached of all of the things that would be for him to be able to talk to Nicodemus about he really throws it out in a lump shell to him the Nicodemus just said sir and Jesus says you must be born again when Nicodemus the greatest of all the religious leaders called even Jesus recognized in debate of that caliber and he said don't you understand these things he said he that's born dove I'll get to it he that's born of water and of spirit he said that's what you need Nicodemus Nicodemus says you mean I got to go back to my mother's wound well he certainly didn't understand the statement that the Lord Jesus was making right the Yeti was the most capable of any of the children of Israel because he was in that position and knowing everything in all and he was brother Branham says and the Bible would verify then he called action the Adiemus in him he was calling him D teacher then Nicodemus verse highs back to him which you're the teacher but are you listening first man Adam a living soul whatever you want to make him before then and he was this and he was that a new that's fine that's wonderful but just remember he had a beginning upon earth and his beginning upon earth was a human element with eternal life into his soul because that would be the plan the purpose of God and what he wanted around Jesus would come the same way to be the god of glory but step into human flesh right shoulders spirit would be eternal but step into human flesh to be the beginning of the creation of God all right when God would come into creation right is that beginning of the creation of God God would have come into creation all right see then in doing that then he was the example the first Adam was the example the second Adam is the example he all right then truly we can see that what Adam lost the second Adam come to restore alright now let's deal with a point that thinking about it and I just want to read that Scripture so go ahead pull up number five and we'll read John 3 but now I don't want to divide I don't want to go verse by verse I want to just read it and then we'll go through something and cover it and it will back up and go verse by verse all right so it won't be you know it's not just well I'll do it and listen to what it says all right now what did Jesus say now remember Letran said this is his first sermon now like we were talking so much was about it that his first miracle was to turn the water to wine but had he not done miracles before probably done plenty of miracles before but it starts out for what you're wanting what you're trying to place it what you're trying to get a beginning and his first was to turn water to wine now watch that in a minute when we related on over to the other part of the scripture okay that was for a purpose it wasn't just that he you know remember his mother's he was talking life's not about it that other words he said I haven't entered my ministry yet well she evidently had confidence in the fact that he could handle the situation so she just turns around to them and says whatever he says do you do it huh but now why does he walk out the doors yet to no one walked out he would have been doing what he was supposed to does it right are you following me if he just walked out and not done nothing she wouldn't still been she would have still know that he was who he was and whatever she didn't force him into a situation to her that he had to do something to explain her he could walk out of the building that's what we're talking about life not he could've just walked out but see she had enough confidence to know that he could handle a situation but he said I haven't entered in my ministry well that wasn't his ministry turning water to wine come on this ministry to turn water to wine you can call it the first miracle but his ministry was there on the River Jordan when he said this is my beloved son attend one pleased to dwell that was his ministry right so then get it right in your understanding and then you won't run off with this great oh this great revelation that doesn't follow all the way through but he did have to turn water into wine I mean her brother did years ago he asked the question said would you turn water into wine I wouldn't want to to pass out a bunch of other people get drunk because I think that's passed and gone but I sure hope that the words that I'm trying to bring this day these two trying to turn water we're getting a minute what is water I'm trying to turn water into wine right I'm trying to preach to you by revelation that will bring you to a spiritual understanding not try to make wine alright now listen there was a man of the Pharisees named Nicodemus a ruler of the Jews the same came to Jesus by night and said unto master rabbi we know that thou art a teacher come from God for no man can do these miracles that thou doest except God be with him jesus answered and said unto Him early early I say unto thee Nicodemus is bragging on him putting him up in a position making him the teacher doing all this uh and Jesus looks at him and says early verily I say unto you except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of God he just looks like he burns him totally out and throws him away but then watch Nicodemus said to him how can a man be born when he's old can he enter the second time into his mother's womb to be born jesus answered verily verily I say unto thee except a man be born to water another spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom of God that which is born to the flesh is flesh and that which is born to the spirit is fear Marvel not did I say unto thee you must be born again all right now he asked him in other words he's died really to Nicodemus is to learn from the Lord Jesus right so he came to him to really ask him questions you remember the man there that come to him said what must we do to be born again well see it's not written that Nicodemus asked him what to do to be born again or whatever that is that would have been to the other illustration but evidently there was a discussion sitting down they didn't just walk you didn't walk in and said Nicodemus you must be born again they probably set to iron discuss things and Nicodemus said well I know you're a man sent from God cousin we can do these things except God be with you and then Jesus says okay now let's see if he means it Nicodemus had made a great statement right declaring him to be the D teacher a man sent from God and Jesus said well let's see if you believe it odd statement said let's see if you believe it he's a Nicodemus you must be born again Nicodemus and you know there was no teaching from the Old Testament in their terminologies that had been brought down upon that situation even the greatest of all the teachings that could come forth of Messiah to come of God to come in human flesh all of the things that they had been taught Nicodemus could have quoted every one of them he could have looked back into Lord Jesus when he said that but he's just so dumbfounded he could look back and he said do you believe you're the Messiah he could have said do you believe you're this do you believe you're that but he didn't do it the Lord Jesus we're really saying let's see if you understand who what you're doing he said you must be born again in Nicodemus that this goes all beyond him because he has no understanding of all of his great mental believing they remember the service the other day were talking about to believe in and there's a book finally got up to the point and Jesus looked at him after they finally said we believe you're this we believe you're that and he lives he said do you now believe Nicodemus was a great believer he believed he was son of God and miracles happening he believed he was a great teacher he believed a lot of things about the Lord Jesus but when the Lord Jesus looked at him and said you must be born again he knew nothing about that there was no teaching about that new birth planted ours we call some scripture that would say back there you must be born again you know some you understand what I'm saying there was no scriptures writing about the new it was tight our shadows and showing it but Nicodemus couldn't handle types and shadows right that's why I love brother branham the way the ears go he would take something and he'd take a type you say now I know you can't understand how that there's just one God but he said let me explain it he said you're a father you're human and you a son see he's taken the tops and the shadows to express the reality but there were no types and shadows for Nicodemus to use until he said you mean I gotta go back to my mother's wound and be born the second time from her in other words he probably was saying listen I've heard some of your teaching some of the things you said around caught it's been rumored you said when are you were not doing too much bother but surely some of them knew something about him cause it had a note something about him how when Nicodemus wanted to come to it you follow me I mean surely somebody they knew all about him and they do it and Nicodemus could probably say listen I've heard some of your teachings I've heard you teaching that we were born wrong he said I've heard some of your teaching and he said we're not gonna argue Nations but I like it like that Oh when brother Bissell and him was talking to that rabbi and that was explaining to him you know what happened in the garden and the rabbi he says to know something paraphrasing it now he said to know that maybe the the problem in the garden was the sex act he said we'd have no problems with that we studied this he said what you bring up a new thing when you say it was between Eve and the Beast see it was something they never thought of but they had taught maybe the act and the problems so Nicodemus is talking to the Lord Jesus and he's saying I know this and I know that and I know some of your teaching but said then after your teachings of me being born wrong are you saying that I've got to go back and be born another time from the mother he said because listen he'd say I'm sensible if I was going wrong the first time the second time would make me no different Rock was not that a sensible answer back to him you know what good would it do for me to have another birth and Jesus said you don't understand now he gets down to a language that we'll get to it in a second he says you must be born from above because that's the original but yet he's bringing it because the poornam deities that see Nicodemus I want to stay on that point before we go to that Nicodemus new things was being said so we just read we read a two-minute account you know two minutes that all it would have talked for the Lord Jesus and Nicodemus has said what you say it we don't put it in there as hours of discussions and and talking we just put all that's just five minutes all he said was in then if it anyways gets up walks out no see expressing it into the language that you'd be Nicodemus would say I know listen if you're following the story then listen to what I'm talking about Nicodemus would say to him say look I know we were born wrong and say I know we were born wrong and said I know Psalm 51 and five that I was shapen in iniquity and in sin did my mother conceive me you could say and I've in Psalm 58 and three the wicked are estranged from the wound and their go astray as soon as they're born speaking lies see we always quote it like bread a rental quote we were born in sin shapen in iniquity spout from our mothers wound and a liar we put it all together as one scripture and then you try to find that scripture and you can't find it because it's not that's not what it says that's two scriptures that says that all right but you see Nicodemus would have to agree to these scriptures right and he would have to agree to the point that job would say in fourteen and one man that's born of a woman is of few days and full of trouble in other words I've heard your your philosophies or stories that people have told that you you taught this that or the other goes like I said now wait a minute Nicodemus you said but but but but that was later in his ministry why are you gonna put another way then why's Nicodemus diary and why's Nicodemus saying we know this and we know that we thought well it's got to be wait until he gets on over here no one Nicodemus could say said I've I've heard a lot of things and said I know the scriptures I know job 15 and 14 they said what is man that they should be clean and he which is born of a woman that he should be righteous you think Nicodemus didn't know them Scriptures you think you didn't know of job 25 and 4 how can man be justified with God ark how can he be clean that is born of a woman you know from the day that I heard the Prophet know it come to me like this those Old Testament Saints those religious leaders they knew about serpent seed maybe not terminologies we use you know of wordings but they knew what happened that was reason that Illustrated want to go where the rabbi said to risk on him said now to her to think about it being sex said that's we've studied those funds we said now to think about it being with even the Beast we haven't studied that that's a new thought the all right and see Nicodemus knew all of these scriptures and he knew that he was born from his mother and he knew that all of that would making him wrong and he knew that but he knew nothing about you must be born again or how to get rid of it now like I said when I first heard this message in in all and I begin to think about I thought my lord in Pharisees why did they say to Jesus we wouldn't born the illegitimate like you right why because they believed his illegitimate see come from the wrong huh but I've also believed this why did those Old Testament signs lie so much on circumcision I would love to talk to a good rabbi and ask him said what's the purpose of circumcision we know physically what it's doing it's cutting off the unclean but what would that mean to Abraham that he had to be circumcised why would it make a different race of people known to and related to Abraham do you understand the children of Israel how the circumcision a lot of people in the world are they're circumcised that's no problem but that was the children of Israel showing the the fact that God had chosen them and gave them the sign of circumcision to show that they were a different nation see if they knew about these things they knew about the circumcisions and the things and what it was all about and see then when Jesus would say anything or at the Nicodemus had heard anything that he taught he knew his relationship was to the fact of being born wrong the inborn wrong though Nicodemus would admit it I don't care how much he believed in his great religious Society but he believed he was born wrong well here's another thing that I've always believed those Jews believed that circumcision done away with a serpent seed doctrine come on they believe the circumcision took a wave to fill to the flesh so we never considered it like that see they believed that those things that God had ordained them to make them a pure people are you following me she's in that away there would be no just a five minute conversation and then Jesus say you must be born again cuz when he hit him the second time right and he said you must be born again Nicodemus nui language and what it meant you must be born let's go into that now let's go back to John brothers and pull out of John 3 and this coldest verse by verse and think about because you can see that is showing the things that have just covered and showing that all of this was taking place and Nicodemus understood a lot of things go ahead and pull up John C there was a man of the first season and Nicodemus a ruler of the Jews the same came to Jesus by night and said unto Him rabbi master teacher look what he was calling him he wasn't walking in hey I heard you got some trained doctors and thing and you're lost and doomed the only way to help I'm talk to you he says rabbi which means teacher we know that thou art a teacher come from God we who's we him and his close relationship right those Jews couldn't deny what was taking place so they had to make it something else and call it bel devote but they couldn't do not a fact that it took place that's what the Bible said he said cause the man was standing there that the miracle was done on how could they say it wasn't right and then remember one of them said he said you you tell me this Saturday he said but show me where you ever opened the eyes of the blind even in your history show me whatever the eyes of the blind Mary stood without eyes open listen we know that thou art a teacher come from God look for no man can do these miracles that I'll do us except God be with him sounds like a pretty good believer you want to make a believer sounds like he's a pretty good believer he's in great position right cause he's a great believer you look at it if they'd have called him dark he would have been thrown out oh they're great groups he's coming secretly to do but he's admitting all of the things that the Lord Jesus that God must be with you look that's why I hit him so hard because after he'd made that great confession look like Jesus would have wrote it yeah you're right I'm this I'm that on the other and he wanted to know if his believing was true you saw I've got a dude bleep bro Dale Nicodemus believed that he was a teacher Nicodemus called him a rabbi Nicodemus Karl said he would come from God and that nobody can do the things you've done except barred to be with him pretty good believer all God dude believe what Nicodemus born-again wasn't mainly he didn't even know what it was about but do we look jesus answered and said unto Him verily verily I say unto thee except a man be born again if you don't see or understand the kingdom now remember listen that was not the wording if you read it in the days of Nicodemus right there was what's translated into the King James and brought down but remember Nicodemus knew exactly what he was saying he knew what this man was saying and he says except a man be born again except a man be born from above now he's totally got out of the world because that's the original translation and brother and verifies the original translation brings you to accept a man be born from above in other words in plain language you got to be born from where I come from if you're going to understand my language in my wording you got to get born from where I come from and I come from above look at what he's putting before him Nicodemus said to him how can a man be born when he's old that's all he knew how could he enter the second time into his mother's womb now what jesus answered verily verily I say unto you except a man a man be born of water and of the spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom of God now what is to be born to water and spirit now you're gonna first automatically run to water baptism you've got a point but don't hold it to that you're gonna run who's got to be born to water baptism got to be baptized name of the Lord Jesus Christ and that's why you see people putting so much emphasis upon baptism bringing you in but that's not what it's saying look except a man be born of water in the spirit he cannot enter that which is born to the flesh is flesh and that which is born to the Spirit is spirit Marvel not that I said unto thee he must be born from above you got to be born from above you got to be born from where he was born from right okay now are you following me so go ahead and down pulling over to number six and let's get this point what does it mean to be born to water and a spirit well we can tell you easily the Spirit is the Holy Spirit that's fine but see we put the emphasis upon the water baptism and that's great because you follow God in the bad piss you need to do that but that's not what it's really getting look now remember I believe that Jesus Christ says this to ever human being you must be born again to every human being on his first doctrine except a man be born of the water that's the word why are you baptized to fulfill the word it doesn't save you right you only doing it as a fulfillment of the word that tells you see that's the water washing of the water by the word and the spirit come on that's the word washing of the water by the word and the spirit which is the Holy Spirit watching the Holy Spirit confirming the word are making the word alive you see what he was saying to Nicodemus Nicodemus you got a great understanding he said you haven't been washed by the word Nicodemus would say well what do you mean I need to get baptized water baptized water I hear that there's a lot going on around y'all do with your baptisms in time because John is baptizing and this is about our innocent that wouldn't want Jesus was talking about she was took him into a deeper depth of washing by the water of the word water baptism will not remit your sins and we say oh the Bible says repented of it and and you show you no no and we put a lot of emphasis upon water baptism what a baptism will not remit your sin it's an answer of a good conscience of what something that's already taken blood with the washing of the water of the word in other words he told Nicodemus he said Nicodemus you want to know how to be born again I won't tell you you need to need to come over here ever not for a while and let's talk about the word we need to sit down and talk about the word and let the word wash e we're gonna get into justification sanctification the baptism of the Holy go the washing of the water by the word going up so Nicodemus is already offered that point except a man be born of the water what does your new birth start with washing of the water by the word now here's what I've always say it and people don't like it if the truth is not talked to you you cannot follow the truth God has to wink at our ignorance a lot of times the bring time but what would it be to go somewhere that they're not teaching the truth what would it be to go to a church in listen-only we go to a church today that would say oh we know what that is washing her water that means water baptism that's water baptism you gotta truth but you don't have deep truth the truth is you got to be washed by the water of the word in other words you need to sit down shut up and listen for a longer water baptism is great and you order do it but then you order just sit down and listen like you don't put a preacher up just cause he's repented and send him into pulpit let him start preaching no he's a novice he is what do you understand being born of the water is the washing of the water by the word not water baptism well brother dad I've done every time well what about the washing what about the constant listening to the word and letting the word clean you out he said Nicodemus you need to be washed by the water of the word now remember he wasn't reading the King James he was reading the language that he knew Nicodemus knew exactly what Jesus was saying but he couldn't follow him in the nuber now he can't follow him in the washing of the water by the word right because he doesn't understand how to water how the word could wash you we see that's the only cleansing of God the only cleansing you got is a washing by the water of the word that's a justification that's a repentance and that's oh you've been washed by the water of the word it's all through your Christian journey you're being washed by the water of the word we'll see how that will be if we just put it on water baptism that's an outward expression supposed to be of an inward work this taking plunge the washing of the water the word is to be inside of you now what about a man sitting there that has no marks against him and yet the Lord Jesus says you've got to be washed by the word in other words plain language what was he saying to Nicodemus Nicodemus stop preaching shut up sit down and listen here's that plain enough but wouldn't out what he was telling him what if Nicodemus Souter said okay now I don't understand this about them you must be born again I can understand your language about what you're saying and I know that we were born wrong so I can follow you in that line what's your meaning maybe I can't follow but I can follow you in the line that you're telling me I need to to be born from above and says now you brought it into a greater depth that I don't understand how can I be washed by the water of the word if you don't hear it how can you be washed by you see why it's so important to hear the truth oh god oh god overlooks all that what if he was in a church today that believed in this message churches that I care I'm here with this seed in me and I don't need the new birth because it always was eternal now where would that fit with Nicodemus Nicodemus is way higher he's way under deeper depth than that because he never played nothing like that Nicodemus didn't say no wait just a minute oh boy I wasn't born in seeing like he was born in seeing the mother guys could holler that but Nicodemus didn't say it because his statement had already been made no man can do what you do unless God be with him and if he was an illegitimate bastard born child then God wouldn't be dealing with you Nicodemus was a whole lot closer than the people of this message that say well I was born with this seed in me I always was eternal then why did Jesus have to come and why did he have to tell a man that his life was perfect no flaws and says look you must be born again and said now I'm going to tell you a little further that you need to sit down and listen to the word and let it wash you how do we get dark turns out of us are you women how you get rid of doctrines I just I just repent one of us good but now how do you get rid of them you study the word and you let the word wash those things out of you right is that true you let that wash it out of you see that'll go all the way through your new birth whatever you start with this keeps on increasing until it's finished I don't mind telling you where I'm headed the day we walk off of this earth in a rapture you can say I'm born again until that time comes you in a process you're being born again that's no problem but listen see Jesus said you must be born from above they said brother branham own kinsman redeemer we live above the Cosby's because we're born from above all Christians come from above jesus said I'm not from below I'm from above you got to be born from above how many you need of run around I'm saying you must be born from our kingdom is above we're born from above then we seek the things which are above God being misunderstood you see what he's talking about that our spirit is born from above the 70th week of Daniel it's the Spirit of God the Holy Spirit upon us and we realized that the Holy Spirit is all-powerful when the message why I'm against organized religion he they here with my words and believeth on him that sent me hath eternal life and when he turn a life comes in there born from above well unless we boy be born again spoken word reading the seed except a man be born again see Jesus said why must we be born again he's dead in the flesh that he's in he's a hybrid you realize what he was saying to Nicodemus he's got to be born again 1 he was born in sin from the eve sin shape it in a nick would he come to the world speaking like he's a liar to begin with no matter how smart educated what more he is he's a liar the Bible says he is you no matter how holy his parents was or anything about he's a liar they'll begin with the only way he can tell truth is to say what truth is true they don't live so what is it what must you be born again because you were born wrong right now go with all these messages it's got all these seeds in it you know what I'm saying they say I don't need the new birth always was eternal well there's no salvation for him no no I have did it now wait what are you saying I'm saying what the Bible says you must be born again anybody you want from brother branham where he says now you don't say you need to be right he said it don't say you need to be born again he said it must be born again cuz if you don't you can't see the kingdom what would you need an uber for if you had eternal life what would Jesus Christ be dying for at Calvary if Nicodemus had eternal life come on why didn't he say to Nicodemus Nicodemus you're the great ruler you're the great man you were a teacher all of these things you understand these things and he always was eternal but he didn't say that did he he said I was born from above and you must be born from he said I died for your sins for the world ever begun then you got to believe it then you got to repent but what did he repent of why did Nick además how to repent of come on what did he have to repent up he didn't steal he didn't cheated enlightened commit adultery didn't do that there was nothing against him had to be anything against him that killed him now what's he going to repent boy he was a pretty good candidate wouldn't it but Jesus never considered this fact whether he was a candidate he just told him what he had to do did you must be born again you got to be born from where I've been born from he said because they're not see he said I'm starting a new Kingdom I'm starting a new race I'm starting a new group of people not working over the old one to repent and just get it all worked up and do these things I ain't taking the offerings and the things like that I remember I used to read that in a Baptist Church and I thought what a god a God had ordained offerings and things and said that's a way for you to contact me he gets on over there in the word and he said your sacrifice and offerings has become a stink in my nostrils he said I don't care about all these things you do he said it's a man with an honest and a contrite heart is the one I look to what was David on my hand was an honest and a contrite heart dirty stinking rascal murderer whatever could you call him yet God said he's a man after my own heart he's God's heart to be a murderer don't not not not gly David had an honest and a contrite heart Schofield says it brought a random verifies that David on his way from the bed with Bathsheba cries out restore unto me the joy of thy salvation sure he was a human being had a lot of problems and he had an honest and a contrite heart he had a repentant heart what does God look for I hope you followed the story of the illustration Nicodemus laughs you can't follow that because Nicodemus over here and Jesus didn't do that to lead over on the third chapter the 14th verse anoonan see you're great you really understand not listening to the illustration you're listening to refute you're not listening to a thought the greatest of all read religious leaders declaring Jesus to be sin of God the car in him to be the teacher Jesus says back to him instead of bragging on him patting him on the back he says Nicodemus you was born wrong you know it you know the Scriptures you know this the psalmist you know what we'll say it you know what all the scriptures say it you know something happened in the garden I said but now I'm telling you you're no good unless you're born from above come along musician what about you and I no good unless we're born from above yes but I believe brothers flowing so called he teaches we come here with this eternal seed within you don't need Jesus so don't even name him no more don't talk to him about your salvation or anything just go ahead and eat drink and be merry because tomorrow you die because you see them dropping out of the message every day just talking this morning just then sister Trudy about it brother Branham said one day he said the very spirit you use daily to overcome is the very spirit that was back there in the dark ages to give their life you realize that an honest and a sincere heart to you I would rather be back gar because it wouldn't be as bad as it is being here he's an operative on Fitzie that's two sides of a story it'd be better to be back guard where you just give you life for the gospel and to hear see it and seeing the message people just falling apart the ones who led you in the message and directed you into seeing the word and see them just walk out and leave the message that's horrible let's tan why must you be born
