corrupted and I lost everything that I that I had on there so I and this afternoon about an hour or so I just quickly just threw some stuff together and it's not I was telling the way it's not in the

things now in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen praise God well I reckon the Lord is just trying our our our patience amen so so I I just could I couldn't believe I was sitting there I was so enthused about getting that I had it all nice laid out and everything and then I had the thing just pops the error it's corrupted I'm like what and I spent all afternoon triy to fix it but anyways technolog is man-made amen but the word of God Amen they can never fail amen let's read this Genesis chapter 2 starting Verse 18 it says and the Lord God said it is not good that the man should be alone I will make him and help me for him and out of the ground the Lord God formed every beast of the field and every foul of the air and brought them unto Adam to see why he would call them and whatsoever Adam called every living creature that was the name thereof it's interesting that God Amen in verse 18 he sees that the man has this need amen that he needs a help meet and immediately he goes to create the animals why didn't he create Eve right there and then amen verse 20 and Adam gave names to all cattle and to the foul of the air and to every beast of the field but for Adam there was not found an help meat for him verse 21 and the Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam and he slept and he took one of his ribs and closed up the flesh instead thereof and the riv which the Lord God had taken from man made he a woman and brought her unto the man and Adam said this is now bone of my bones and Flesh of My Flesh she shall be called woman because she was taken out of man therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother and shall cleave unto his wife and they shall be one flesh and they were both naked the man and his wife and were not ashamed praise God you may be seated tonight amen better wait if some get some water something get that lucky cup amen appreciate it praise God brother brandom says here in this message where hear what hearest thou Elijah he says oh how that we need in this journey that we're in now to find a place of rest and to Feast on the word of God so that so that it'll give us strength night after night go to the room and rest and come back the next morning fresh and eat more for there's a great journey and a great battle ahead for the church amen I believe we're in that battle right now amen great I believe that we have been children long enough amen God's going to turn his church into a manhood now amen so we've been discussing amen the stature of a perfect man we're in that process right now each one of us amen and we played and frolicked as children but now we're going to have to put away childish things and take on manhood amen maturity I believe it was Paul who said when I was a child I spake as a child because he thought as a child but it's time that we begin to think like men and women now for we've got to get down to business amen and I believe we're living in a Time amen that it's it's it's no time to play Church no time Amen to just uh just be nonchalant and as I've said before put this thing on cruise control cuz when you put it on cruise control what happens you fall asleep at least that's what happens to me when I put the car in cruise control I fall asleep and if it's like that in physical how much more in the spiritual you know so uh it's it's God calling us to a certain maturity amen and you shouldn't be in the same in the same state that you were 5 years ago amen you should be beyond that now 5 years later but sometimes we're up and down like this like while we're on a roller coaster ride now I know we're going to have our ups and downs we're going to have our ins and outs amen but then we shouldn't be having our backslides and our backslides out and our backslides in backslides out constantly amen praise God we should be amen constant now Adam here God knew when he created Adam uh and put him in the Garden of Eden he knew that he that that in Adam there was going to be a point in time that Adam was going to need to find out that he had something in him in him that he needed to understand that he needed to have amen now Adam didn't know now you you think God God put Adam in such a perfect perfect world there was no sin the animals didn't bite uh everything was perfect amen and he could just enjoy from every fruit of of the tree and just it wasn't that he needed to eat he just could just enjoy amen he could eat grapes he could eat apples he could eat whatever he wanted to and it was just for an enjoyment it was just for pleasure so he had he was living in a perfect world he lived in a in a in in in in a world that you and I amen desire to live in amen and I believe we're heading back to that amen we're heading back to that Perfection because if it's in in us somewhere in US craving that amen then that means that that's somewhere out there for us amen as they said that the the what is it the the the egg had the chicken or the egg had to be first before the chicken or the chicken vice versa you know what I mean but when there's a deep calling to the Deep there's got to be a deep to respond amen so there can't be something that you're craving and it's not being it's not there amen we desire that amen so it's got to be there for us praise God so Adam was put in this in this position amen and and and and if we read let's read back in verse 18 it says and the Lord God said it is not good that man should be alone I will make him a help meat for him so God knew that God was under was was in control man and God thought it wasn't good for man to be alone amen so God was going to make Adam a help meat for him amen now Adam didn't know this God KN knew it Adam didn't know that so it came a point in time amen that that that Adam uh uh he he was with the animals and uh he looked at the animals and and God had a plan for Adam Amen in regards to those to those animals amen amen and and I believe God Amen is mindful of our ways in that way amen he knows the beginning from the end he knows he knows uh uh uh what what your what your end what your end is going to be just like Jeremiah uh says in Jeremiah 291 for I know the thoughts that I think toward you sayth the Lord thoughts of peace and not of evil to give you what to give you an expected end so it's an end that it doesn't take God by surprise it's an end that he expects of you amen it's something that he expects it's not nothing that happens in our life amen takes God by surprise God just didn't said amen oh my goodness that happened to Brother Joseph Canada what am I going to do he looks over at at the Angels what are we going to do no no nothing like that takes the price of God Amen it's an expected end that he's bringing you to amen all things work together for good to them that love God Amen somewhere or another it's going to amen it's going to be shaped into his perfect will amen praise God so God brings the animals to Adam Amen to see what he would call them so before I I I I I tell the young people amen before especially the young man before you go out get trying to get married you must have a task in hand in other words you must have a job you must have something that you're doing amen physically cuz you're not going to help support that the the the the the wife amen just with kisses and hugs that's not that's part of it amen but that's not going to bring food to the table so God here before he presents his bride to Adam he gives him a a work to do he gives him something to do that he needs to accomplish before he can have that desire that yet he still doesn't know what it is but through this naming of the animals he'll find out amen so he gives him a task Amen to do before uh be before uh he he comes to that position because see Adam needed to realize that he needed companionship with someone just like the animals had their companion you see the lion had the Lioness the female line you know the dog had female dog and the monkey had the female monkey and all these the the serpent had a female serpent sometimes we forget that there could there was a female serpent too if there was a male serpent there had to been a female serpent so all these all these animals had their own but Adam did not have one for himself so God what does God do he brings the the the animals to Adam amen and let's read down here where it says um verse 19 it says and out of the ground the Lord God formed every beast of the field and every foul of the air and brought them unto Adam to see what he would call them now that's key to see what he would call them not what God would call them but what he would call them amen why because God has so much confidence in the word that that Adam was going to speak it was just as good as what as what God's saying it amen now the question is is does God have the same confidence in the word that you that comes out of your mouth amen because if it's the word of God Amen God's got to say Amen to that do you believe God says Amen to his word amen I believe God says amen if it's his word he's going to amen that and how does he amen it amen by bringing down and confirming that word amen amen praise the Lord so God gives Adam this task to do amen and God gives man the opportunity amen he gives him this opportunity to realize within himself that he needed that companionship amen see God can't do everything for us I if if God did everything for us then there wouldn't be anything for us to overcome how can we be called Overcomers in this life if we don't overcome anything amen but there's going to be some Overcomers in this life right I believe that at every age amen and even in this wicked age there's going to be some Overcomers there's going to be some young people that are going to overcome there's going to be some older people that are going to overcome amen some middle-aged people are going to overcome because we're in the age amen overcome we're living in an age Saints where it's it's it's uh we're supposed to take a body change amen that hasn't happened amen since since the the the well en yeah since Jesus amen and Enoch was the one who who took who took a took a Rapture amen we're supposed to be doing we're supposed to getting back to that to that same position amen as Enoch so we have we have a great thing amen a great task among ourselves amen Saints and we desire that am we desire that just like John says amen so come quickly Lord Jesus right praise God Amen so God can't do everything for us amen some things we have to do on our own or amen or take them by faith amen we can't understand everything we can't explain everything right and if we could then there wouldn't be no need for faith we could explain every single thing I don't understand a lot of things I don't understand many many things but I just take them by faith because I know that he does not lie right am amen and if he said it amen I believe it praise God brother uh if you're reading Numbers chapter 33 I'll read this real quick and if you could pull it up the brothers could pull it up I want you to I want you to look at something here real quick in numbers 33 started at verse 51 it says speak unto the children of Israel and say unto them why say unto them when ye are passed over Jordan into the land of Canaan then I shall drive out of all the inhabitants of the land yeah it doesn't say that does it good I it says then ye shall drive out the inhabitants right of the land from before you and destroy all their pictures and destroy all their molten images and quite pluck down all their high places and I shall dispossess no and ye shall dispossess the inhabitants of the land and dwell therein why why why is God telling the children of is Israel this now in the same way he's telling us to do the same thing spiritually speaking because look what happens here it says for I have given you the land to possess it God had already given them the land to possess it now they just needed to go and do what they needed to do Amen to possess it God has given us amen all these promises precious promises he's given us the uh he's given us word precious word amen now you you got to do is take it by faith amen believe it and act upon it and watch it come to pass right it can be the simplest thing God's not calling us Amen to to to do such a great thing like they had they had uh going on here amen but in just our everyday life right Amen in Simplicity uh that's what God is calling us Amen to exercise our faith in now sometimes sometimes we we think well if I could if I could do this or if I could just if I could preach or if I could uh be a deacon if I could do this amen amen but what about you sister amen who who stays at home watching the children you have to live by faith right what of you Brothers amen who who go day every day amen to work you have to live by faith you might not be a minister amen but your life is ministering to somebody amen you might not be a a deacon you might not be none of these things amen but you are affecting somebody's life amen through your life Somebody's Watching You Somebody's Watching Me praise God amen so it's it it's up to us Saints amen God has already given us the promise God's already given us everything that we need of for this journey and it all Lays inside of you amen you just may you got dig into that word amen and stay with that word and keep on day by day taking it one day at a time amen and watch you're dispossessing then you're on grounds right there Amen to dispossess the enemy amen praise God Amen so if we continue here going back to Genesis chapter I just wanted to let you all know that to show you amen that God God thinks more of you than what you think of yourself God knows that you can that's why the scripture says that I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me praise God now let's go back to Genesis chapter uh two and continue reading verse 19 here and it says here and whatso and whatsoever Adam called every living creature that was the name thereof period so everything that Adam said amen one day Adam was walking walking and all of a sudden he heard a I can't make the sound just like it but does it sound close he hears it again and he hears this roaring so he finds and he sees a lion and how how how how how the the the hair around his hair and how powerful he looks and he said you know what I think I'm going to call this lion and God down up God up in heaven amen God just looking at Adam and he's just probably just crossing his arms and looking down at to his son and says that's son just called him Adam I mean lion hey man I like that amen that's exactly what I was thinking Adam so then so then Adam Adam is walking one day and he hears this do you all know what that is see that I if it wasn't for the Nicaragua trip that probably would have been able to get it better he sees this this this this this animal in the sky flying so high the the wings are are are are are so huge and and he sees how high this animal can fly and he he says my look how how high that animal can fly and my goodness look at the wingspan on that I think I'm going to call him Eagle amen and God was looking up in heaven and he said amen Adam it's exactly what I was thinking amen son I like that and then another time that Adam was walking by and he hears uh that sounded more like a horse than it then but it had a big old trunk huh huge huge uh animal and he said I'm going to call that an elephant and God said I was thinking the same thing son my goodness I was thinking the exact same thing amen and then one day he sees a little white little bird and and he's looking at it and and and the little bird lands on him and he's petting it and and how sweet it was and it was so tender looking and Adam said you know it's not like the other animals it's so tender So Soft amen so white so clean I think I'm going to call him Dove and God said what he had to say Amen cuz that's exactly what God was thinking amen so God Said Amen to every single thing that Adam called all the animals amen God Said Amen to it amen and whatever you do Saints just bringing it back home L man whatever you do can God say Amen to the things that you do in life right brother amen now remember he can only say Amen to to his word and whatever you do amen and whatever you think and the way you act and the way you react if it's not according to the word he can't say Amen to that he can't bless amen nothing outside of his word but he did with Adam right and he put this task before Adam and Adam fulfilled the task amen Adam completed the task praise God Amen so and continue reading here in verse 20 it says and Adam gave names to all cattle and to the fowl of the air and to every beast of the field but here's the key thing but for Adam there was not found an help meat for him so when naming the animals and and looking at the animals and and and spending this this time with the Animals Adam realizes that they have Partners but he didn't have a partner himself and that's where God wanted to put Adam that was the position where God wanted to put Adam right there and then cuz he wasn't just going to give him Eve just like that although Eve was already in him you you see where I'm trying to get to Evil's already in him but he did not know that right he did not know but God put him in a position where he needed to realize and desire that he himself and God sometimes needs to put in positions amen where you can't turn anywhere else amen but to him where you realize that his word is right and I'm going to go with it amen he puts you sometimes in positions amen where he's going to see let me see what brother Wade's going to do in that certain situation and then you think amen sometimes you think in those certain situations Lord why am I in this position why why why are you allowing this in my life God wants to test to see what your reaction is going to be if it going to be according to his word or not am amen God loves doing that why because we are his children you know I I we've done that to ourselves to our to well I just say to to Bella we we deliberately test her sometimes to see what her reactions are going to be and then according to her reactions if she failed then we can go ahead and correct her now if we do that in this in the physical how much more the Lord he loves doing that to his children why because he's building character in our lives amen and in this name in The Animals it wasn't just for God to for Adam to just name the animals it was God trying to bring bring something out of Adam that he didn't know that was there amen So Adam realizes amen all these animals have female counterpart and I don't have mine praise God and so he couldn't find it in the line he didn't find it in the giraffe he didn't find it in the monkey he didn't find it in the serpent and just in those same things Saints amen you young people you can't find satisfaction Amen in any of the things of this life either of the Earthly animals of this life now you can't find it in Facebook you can't find it in YouTube you you can't find it in your cell phone you can't find it amen all those things are temporary and they're going to perish because they're Earthly amen you're not going to find it amen in the two Souls you're not going to find it in the in the return Ministry you're not going to find it in the uh uh all the doctrines that are out there now you can go from one to the other just bounce back and forth like a pingpong machine amen and you won't find true satisfaction in none of them right if it's outside of the word just like Adam amen he couldn't find satisfaction in any of those animals amen those Earthly beasts you won't find satisfaction in the beasts of this life amen unless it's in the word of God praise God CU nothing really satisfies the true the the the believer only Jesus only Jesus Give Me Jesus amen amen so after Adam does his part amen then God goes ahead and does his part and what does AD what does God do he puts Adam to sleep and he goes ahead and starts working a work in his heart in his life amen takes the rib out and from there he forms a woman right amen I I and and Adam amen he had he had peace amen and he had confidence amen that that God was doing a work in him in him amen and he just went ahead and rested in God and in resting amen look what the outcome was that was that's what we should do amen is just rest in the Lord amen that he knows what he's doing he knows what's what every every he knows every single detail of Our Lives amen and how to get us Amen to the to the End Amen praise God so he puts Adam to sleep and and out of him the the Bible says he creates he creates uh the woman takes the rib out Amen in verse 21 it says and the Lord God caused the Deep Sleep to fall upon Adam and he slept and he took one of his ribs and closed up the flesh instead thereof and the rib which the Lord God had taken from man made he woman and brought her unto man right so Adam wakes up just as God in verse I believe it was verse 19 God brings the animals to to to to to Adam God does the same thing with with Eve brings her to Adam he didn't come he didn't go to Eve amen Eve came to him because God brought him to her I mean her to him amen and so I can just imagine when Adam still just wakes up and he sees this female counterpart amen he may not understand it right away amen but all of a sudden something just clicks amen that's exactly what I was looking for it's exactly what I needed Amen in verse 22 it says here and Adam says and Adam said this is now bone of my bones and Flesh of My Flesh now as Adam called the animals and named the animals here he also he's calling the woman amen by inspiration amen and and God didn't say up there no no no don't call her that no that's exactly what God was thinking too and Adam said this is now bone of my bones and Flesh of My Flesh she shall be called woman because she was taken out of man right and God said amen amen cuz that's exactly what God was thinking too amen so you notice here that Adam uh now now doesn't just give the woman a name but he says that she is bone in my bone and flesh in My Flesh in other words she's just like me exactly she's just like me glory amen I wonder sometimes if we think of our wives that way you remember is she bone of your bone flesh of your flesh amen and and Adam if if I I always thought if if God would have just given Adam he you know Eve you know just without him realizing that he needed a female counterpart when Eve would have fallen he could have just said well Lord just give me another one because I don't you know this one no but he came to a point that he loved Eve so much because she came out of him amen she Lo he loved her so much that if what happened to her amen he he he wanted to be there for her as well no matter what happened amen he fell with her as well right because they were both one unit amen they weren't both separate units they were both one unit and sometimes amen we we live our lives amen as husband and wives and one's got a bank account here and the other one's got a bank account here amen that's not going to work well it's not what Dave Ramsey taught heyen but just giving as an example you know cuz and then the man you know know and one doesn't want to to share with with the other this is my money I I worked for this you get your own money you know you all should work as one unit amen you're one amen and you're one for one for one goal amen your one goal first of all to be Christlike second of all God's given you a family that you need to raise amen and those children are looking at youen and if you know how to work as one unit amen those children will learn that value amen that I should work with one as one unit as well amen ones off doing this here about and then and the other one does not know anything about it you know praise God right let me just get off that look I just speak for experience I if I say anything here it's because amen the the I've experienced amen but but but you know I appreciate I appreciate my wife and I appreciate amen that we we we have that mindset to work as one unit amen praise God and it's taken me several lessons cuz I'm a hard I'm a hard learner several knots in the head Amen to learn that you just don't leave leave your wife amen just by herself you know whenever you want to just leave the house you know and amen but you know she has needs too right when you get home from work even though you've worked all day even though you've you've sweated all day but it hasn't been as rough as dealing with children in the house at least you're by yourself dealing with with with with you know just working you know it's not as rough get to the house and you've been talking 5-year-old language all day long and when the woman greets you when the wife greets you at their house she you know she greets you in a 5-year-old language you know cuz that's how she's been dealing with all day long she wants to talk to an adult when she gets home so to get down to the level as man that was hard that's hard but that's that's a sacrifice that's something amen that's beneficial for each one of us so through marriage amen we we become more like him amen and we appreciate and learn things that we wouldn't have learned otherwise amen so God God doesn't see amen doesn't see you like any other woman he doesn't see you like any other other other other uh denominational women out there amen he sees you special you're come from him amen you're you're elected amen you're bone of his bone flesh of his flesh life of his life and he'll do whatever he can Amen to make sure that you come and draw and become to his very image he won't let his children out if you're his child amen he's going to make sure that you come Amen to him amen cuz I've been out in the world I've done these things I've I've I've I've backslid and and done these things but if you're a true child of God something in you just won't leave you alone I mean I just uh I know that for a fact I just can't get away from God I just can't get away from no no matter how much I want to throw the towel throw in the towel I still can't get away from him and I just thank God Amen because it's been him amen holding me I can't hold myself it's been him holding me praise God appreciate the Lord amen so so let's read real quick here at uh in Joshua Joshua chapter 10 and just give an example amen another example Joshua chapter 10 and starting at verse 5 well I'll just I'll just I'll skip a lot of this but I'll just start at vers 12 it says then spake Joshua unto the Lord in the day when the Lord delivered up the amorites before the children of Israel and he said in the sight of Israel son stands thou still upon gibian and thou moon in the valley of aelon and what did God say God said amen and the sun Stood Still and the moon stayed until the people had Avenged themselves upon their enemies is not this written in the book of jasher so the sun Stood Still in the midst of heaven and hasted not to go down about a whole day and there was no day like that before it or after it that the Lord listen to that that the Lord hearkened unto the voice of a man amen amen amen amen so the Lord does hearken to the voice of a man when that voice amen and that word is according to his word amen for the Lord fought for Israel amen so that's the Lord is fighting for his children tonight amen amen and if his word is on our lips amen God no matter what happens no matter what you go through amen if it's according to his word God will just say Amen to that right if you say if you say to this mountain be removed and don't doubt in your heart amen but believe then you shall have that period amen because it's according to his word amen amen so when Joshua told the Sun and the Moon to stand still right God said amen praise God see God had already told him to possess the land and that he had already delivered the amorites unto them and all they had to do was just act upon it that's all they had to do so don't be afraid Saints to act upon the word of God Amen if it's the word of God Amen just take it as it is and move on with it and remember the way God amens his word is by vindicating it in your life amen just as God Amen had no no doubt whatsoever that when he gave the animals to Adam to name God knew that he wasn't going to speak outside of his word therefore he knew that he could amen every single word that came out of Adam right because it was his word amen now that bride Amen in this day amen she won't speak outside of this word even the prophet said that she can't speak outside of this word because they're one unit amen they're thinking the same thing and therefore they will speak the same thing amen praise God how many love the Lord tonight sir amen so I trust that that little thought was helpful to you cuz I know some of us you know we're going through some things and uh and you just wonder why the Lord why Lord why am I going through this and why happened and all of a sudden you know but you know what God's in control God God has confidence in you that you're going to react the the the right way and if you fail like brother Wade was saying Sunday and if you fail that test well you can retake it again cuz if you're his child you're going to retake it again until you get to that Amen to each level Amen to we come to the stature of a perfect man right amen praise God that's what I desire Saints thank you Lord praise God um if we want to bring up the PowerPoint presentation of whatever I had left of it um the uh as I said as I said uh brother Mike Sebert if if some of you don't don't know who he is he's a brother from Dayton Ohio uh he pastors a church over there I believe it's called Open Door Church something like that I've never been to his church before but I met brother Mike S A couple of years ago at at the Ruth North Carolina camp meetings and he found out that I I you know I I do some interpretation work so he asked me uh about four years ago if I could go to Nicaragua with him and uh I told him that I would but that during that same time uh um opportunities for me to go to the Philippines were were coming up so I felt led to go that direction so for three years brother Mike was asking me to go to Nicaragua and I told him either I I had you know I had to go to the Philippines I had made a commitment to that and then one year we were we were in Canada and I just couldn't make it that time but this year he uh well towards the end of last year he called me up and he said uh are you available this time to go to Nicaragua and I said well I'm not planning on going anywhere this this coming year brother Mike he said well let's go ahead and take care of those tickets then he said you're going there's no excuse this time so so uh but you know what uh I even if I didn't have the plan to go amen I I believe it was in the will of God for us to be there amen and uh we certainly enjoyed ourselves and uh uh I believe the people of God were blessed and I appreciate each and every one of you who who who who took part in helping me send uh in helping me go there amen whether it was financially or your prayers I really appreciate each and every one of you and certainly uh uh I could go into so many more details some more details of the of some things that took place there but uh we'll see what the Lord brings to my remembrance since my PowerPoint presentation's shattered amen so let's uh let's go ahead and go to the next next slide for those who don't know nicar Costa Rica and Nicaragua is located in Central America and there's there's my home country right there Colombia but uh so um uh so Costa Rica this is Nicaragua right here and then this is Costa Rica right here um just a quick fact the current population of Costa Rica is approximately 4.94 million the capital of Costa Rica is San Jose okay I promise I won't there you go you guys see that technology is awesome until it crashes thank you brother way um uh for those who don't know Costa Rica has become one of the top destinations for Americans to retire at a lot of Americans and they retire they go down there to retire so uh and believe it or not they take dollars down there yeah you can pay with dollar anywhere same thing in in Panama I believe and Nicaragua was the same thing for the most part uh the and now the current population of Nicaragua is approximately 6.2 million ion the capital of Nicaragua is managa uh Nicaragua is the largest country in Central America so you can see it's it's the biggest out of all of them um and uh both countries are located in Central America both are on the on Central Standard Time so it's not like it was in the Philippines some of you ask did you did you get jet lag no it was just one hour behind so so no jet lag but but brother is going to get some jet lag here in a couple of weeks so uh let's go to the next slide uh this is brother Mike Sebert for those who don't know him um he's a pastor at Dayton Ohio started doing youth camps in South Central America he's also done in India and Europe about 20 years ago so he's really dedicated I and also he has his Youth Camp that he does in Ohio as well every summer um so he's really dedicated he he loves he loves the youth and uh he's really dedicated himself in the last 20 25 years doing this uh he's been going to Costa Rica and Nicaragua for the last 18 or 19 years some of the young people who attended his first youth camps are now pastoring churches or helping in the ministry in some way or another I met I met uh down there several Brothers I mean just 28 29 years old uh one of them was about 25 years old and they're pastoring churches now yeah um so the Brethren down there some of them are are are really into missions in that in the area I mean they get up there going into the mountains and Honduras and everything so these are really dedicated dedicated youth that uh and these youth camps have been very beneficial CU you can see the fruit of them you know right so let's go to the next slide uh we went to uh Costa Rica on January the 2nd I left here January the 2nd uh they get no sleep at all because my flight left uh at 700 in the morning that day and I I had to be in the airport about 4 in the morning 5: in the morning but uh we were in no in in Costa Rica for for two days and this is Brother this is where we held the uh the meetings at uh in San Jose uh this is Brother mono kua's Church t and has said and that's brother brother Monica another great servant of the Lord he's done a lot of work in Central America so go ahead and the next slide you can play this video and if you can turn it up you can hear what hopefully it plays you just don't know how these things are going to react when anyways this is when we when we got to to the to the church and uh I was just giv a little report uh and uh we were getting ready to to eat and we were going to have the first service that night so as soon as we got there I mean it was time to work there were no time to lay down so we're getting ready to eat have some lunch and I think we're GNA have a service tonight so um so you can go to the next slide um all right so this is the service that that that night that first night there was some other people uh that were coming in in the next two two uh the next two days that came in this is just a song service uh this really uh really wonderful people uh really uh really humble really enjoyed being with this this uh meeting was they usually uh hold the meetings and and they they have several churches that come together uh but this time uh they decided to to have other meetings at the same time going on at the same time in other areas um and so there wasn't as many people as there usually is um so this was more like a Family Camp than it was a youth camp this first Camp so all right next slide now this is the this is that first night um brother Co brother Tim the master amen and she realized that same power can take me back amen amen hallelujah hallelujah we need the prophet and we need the message but it is equally important that we have the power of the Holy Ghost amen amen that's the power that makes the word live that's the power that overcomes Satan it overcomes Temptation it overcomes the world it takes you away from this world to the presence of Christ amen God Almighty amen amen in the message earnestly contending for the faith brother re says the very animal that she was watering was the very animal that packed her to see her bride what those other girls were thinking look at Rebecca she's a fanatic first of all she's following a man second of all she's watering that crazy camel but Rebecca knew this is a special C amen amen this C is going to take me away from all of this amen amen amen you kind of get a get a little uh brother Tim cross was one of the easiest ones to interpret for you know because he take he gives you time you know to interpret but uh let's go to the next next one brother David Siler those uh well this is right after this one but this um this is a little uh youth service that they have with for for the children brother Mike has he loves to sing with them that song I'm sure you'll know what it is H H Hall hallel hallu hallelu hallelu glor glor hallu hallelu hallelu amen um we had uh during the the the service for the adults there was usually a little service for the children going on as well so this is one of the services that uh that they were but Tim cross he spoke it to the children at this specific one um I was saying Brother David Syler he's an evangelist from brother Donnie Reagan's church and uh he uh he was there as well and um he's a fireball preacher if you're know and uh I didn't know but during that time uh when I was uh about the second day that I was there I was coming I was coming with something and I I I was getting sick and Brother David Siler me interpreting for Brother David Syler did not help at all he shot he shot my voice and uh if you turn go to the next slide I think I think this is yeah this is him ministering just listen to his real quick he said Lord I don't know what your name is You' never told me what your name is but when God spoke to Moses I am am it's because Moses needed a present God he didn't say I was I will be but I am right now I am a present I a pres so he revealed him in the way he wants to be known the reason this message never go amen this message can never go out of day this Bible can never grow because this is the book T that sent Moses to Egypt that same God has spok this hour and he has sent us a Vindicated prophet not just a prophet IND you believe that amen let's try that together we're going to try that together and the church say amen amen amen amen not just a prophet a vated prophet with I believe that don't you you realize why was that God sent this m you can kind of get an idea and he he preached a really good message that night was about blind bmus never heard it preached that way before but we had a good time next slide I believe this was at the end of the service we prayed for a lot of people and they they they I told some of the people that and but they'll probably experienced this by the way you you preaching the me preaching the word is is is different than when you're praying for people praying for people it just it it literally it it wears you out I mean it wears you out praying for people and you know what the prophet went through and especially when people pulling on the gift that he had you know but the people there were really really hungering for God I mean you could tell uh that uh the word really has an effect on the people you know um so okay all right um next slide Brother Anderson all right now the the next the next that was uh Frid Saturday night and then the next uh Sunday morning uh Minister again listen to a minute here it I said Jeremiah can't see nothing it don't look like his time on this time on this the has may look like nothing right you know it's not an interpret in interpreting it's not it's not you're interpreting word by word sometimes you have have to take As an interpreter you have to take the thought that's being said and and and and bring it to to the people in a way in the level that they're going to understand it it's not it's not just the thing about just interpreting word for word cuz even when the when the brother Brandon's messages are interpreted or translated you can't translate it directly word for word exactly how you said it you have to take the thought and then bring it bring the thought to the person in the best way and so the same thing happens when you're in interpreting uh and so all that's going on at the same time that you're sitting here straining your voice and uh but I just thank God Amen that he gave me the strength to do to do so am amen um this is uh This Is Us just a having a little here we are eating at Tip Top my voice upside down almost gone thanks to this voice right there and uh there's brother Tim brother vente it was another one of the interet Mexican he he goes to brother Burley Williams Church brother uh uh Zachary Wallace and his wife and there's little Shalom she's about to tear up some chicken herself they had their little baby in liquid form that is you know this time around I did not eat any gross food or anything like that cuz I was with American Brethren and they wouldn't dare touch places like that so brother Mike and then they would they would just take them to to places that was a place called tiptop and it's like a KFC you know so uh I wanted to eat the local food but you know I had to eat what so cuz I eat that here all the time you know know I want something different when I'm down there um I'm not sure what this is like I said Saints uh it's upside down too this is uh when we uh this is after we left Costa Rica and we went uh this is in Nicaragua now we were getting ready to uh start the meetings over there the camp and uh they were going to be held for a whole week um Texas and uh just kind of get a little panoramic of the camp ground here panoramic of the campground making darl Ward right there all right you can stop it brother darl Ward right there all right so next yes I did yeah but he's not as bad as Brother David this is a um play this brother this is some of the young people singing there at Youth Camp um majority of these uh these young people I mean you can really really love the Lord you know it's I hate to say it but it's not like I mean and you see it in the Philippines you see it in a lot of in a lot of foreign countries you you see the young people and they're so much different than young people here in the states I mean here in the States they're they're they got everything their their possession you know they and they they're just so nonchalant you know and so shy and so you know the young people over there they they come up talk to you like an adult you know they're very mature they're very and they love the Lord you know um next slide this is one of the knights there at that camp brother Daryl Ward and this is the one of the other interpreters uh brother Paco he's from Honduras darl sweat bad he sweats so bad that his his uh his shirt you know it's dripping down here and it looks like the shirt's bigger than than than than it's supposed to be thank God for the thank God for the truth thank God also for the Holy Ghost for God that mes among we can have all the answers to all the questions but if we don't have God what good is it we the answers but we don't know the God who gave the answers stop brother all right NE next um that night after brother brother uh Daryl he he ministered uh we we had a there was about 45 minutes of just people just up front just giving their heart to God you know and we were ministers just praying over each one of them I took a couple of seconds of video of it go ahead brother Anders don't see that amen um oh by the way back in Costa Rica uh there was about uh there were several people that got baptized as well so um so that was wonderful to to see this is uh this was on that Thursday that Thursday night or that Thursday morning I had not interpreted the meeting started on Monday I had not interpreted or done anything until Thursday because I just couldn't and Thursday is when I finally got an interpreter for brother Zach brother Zach he's from Arizona Zach Wallace I think his dad is his wife's name is Hannah and they're very Brown they have no water and as I looked across there was one place where a great way to start back up they put me with Brother David Tyler right away although Brother David how it got to a point where he didn't want he wanted me to interpret for him and uh I said well I I had to tell him I I said but David remember i' I've been sick and and uh you need to make sure that because when you're up there the people if if your voice is overriding my voice I can't get the thought the people are not going to understand what you're saying if I can't tell the people if I can't express it to them so if if if I can't express it to them it's just like just two crazy guys up there just just going back and forth you know and so he he understood and uh and now that was that was Thursday night um for some reason um that's brother Daryl Ward he's ministering and I interpreted for him that night he why he was the witness he had made contact you know what he said I am not ashamed the for is the power of uh that night I had I was somebody else was going to interpret for him but I just really felt strong to interpret for brother Daryl that night and uh I told Brother Daryl I said brother Daryl is it all right if I can interpret for you you cuz brother usually he takes brother uh another brother with him to interpret for him usually and brother Daryl said as long as brother the brother Danny doesn't mind you go ahead and interpret for her so we fixed it up to where where you know and we had we had a great service that night uh and uh brother Daryl said that um that after the after the service that night he said that uh what happened was is that he just felt led that the people just put their hand on on each other and just pray for one another other and as they were doing that you know the Holy Spirit just came down and just uh it was a sweet presence in there and he said that he was walking by every row every row of people and there was this one sister who said that he that that that that Tuesday night she could not she could not get to the prayer line that there was a prayer line and uh he said that he and she said that she was praying for within herself she said Lord if uh I was not touched because in in those countries you know they they feel like if you touch them you know that it just helps their faith you know he said I was not touched that night and then at just about that just about that time brother darl Ward goes and puts his hand on on her as she was thinking that so God knew amen what she was thinking of and at that moment brother Daryl put his hand on her he had no idea that that's what she was Desiring and uh so later on she told us that testimony told Brother Daryl amen um after the services were over that the Youth Camp that week uh we went to another part of Nicaragua and we uh ministered at one of the churches there and it's just not completely there but that uh that Friday before it was the last night of the camp and I I had interpreted for Brother David Siler and 20 minutes into the preaching uh I went into a cing coughing fit I just could I coughed for about 5 minutes luckily there one of the other brothers stepped in help helped me and uh then until I I got better and I was able to get back in and and continue to interpret so this is Brother uh neon's Church in Chinandega uh and this is about two hours away from the capital of managa this is where the church is where it's located is around active volcanoes there's like uh there's a active volcano in that area and uh it was really really nice ni Church all right next at the same time when we were ministering there brother uh brother Mike seber was ministering in another church uh in that same area and uh This Is Us after the service and we were riding through uh try to take volcano there and it's active and the last time it it uh it was uh it it blew out uh Ash uh it was three years ago and the Brethren there told me that uh the roads everything is just completely covered and they have to close down the the roads you can't travel them um I think some of these These are the young people wanted to say hello back to the states that is a Land Cruiser yeah the brother one of the pastors there in Nicaragua he has a a business where he uh he rents out vehicles and he has uh he has these Land Cruisers but they've completely tooken out the back part of them and put some side seats on the side and those things I mean they they're great to go that's how we went up to the mountains with and uh so next slide how how are we on time brother all right uh right before after uh after we ministered that morning I went to uh the church where brother Mike uh uh ministered at he wanted me to give greet the people there and give them a testimony this is the name of the pastor Pastor here is brother Pedro and um those people there just pull on the word so much I went up there to just give a testimony i instead of giv a little sermon that said said we feel something he said I was say is even hard to to even pray now now I was telling them that out of this age there's going to be some Overcomers and said how can you be Overcomer if you have not overcome anything and it said we got to be said we got to be like Caleb go up and possess possess take up take my mountain the holy spirit is for me the word of God is for me body change is for me all those things belong to the children of God keep moving forward Brethren Lord willing I I want to be back again and and uh I just told him next time I come I want to see them more on fire than what they are amen go ahead brother Anderson next next one all right um that that was our Sunday because there's a presence of this is now up in the mountains can you pause it brother brother Anderson of course I was preaching on the mirror right there see my trusty mirror in my hand and uh we uh we uh we went up 6 hours or 7h hour drive uh from up to the mountains and we were going to have a camp there as well and uh uh there was the majority a lot of these people that came to the camp they they they came two days and two days it took them and by uh by bus and different things some of them even walked Walked uh uh just walking one whole day just to get to a camp meeting I it just just puts you to shame these people will do these people will do that kind of stuff and we don't we can't even get to church on Wednesday barely and and we just live down the road go ahead brother no you want to go back and you can play play the video If it plays but I I was able to minister there in that in this Camp if it doesn't play it's okay um I ministered there three times so I think it was just to interpret I was able to minister a couple of times as well and uh and uh the last day there uh the last Sunday there um I was invited by another brother um brother uh Antonio to minister and I did Minister upside down but uh so okay you you can pause it brother amen um I'm just trying to remember things that took place we there was one night when we were having Services there in in in the mountains this drunk man came in right off the street and uh he said uh he said can you just pray for me I just need prayer uh could pray for me he said I I he said I left I left one one uh um what is it he said I left something to go into something else in other words he had left uh and something to go into drinking and stuff and he's like from one thing to the other and so I just me and another brother we just stood there and we just prayed for him and you can smell alcohol on him and really strong and everything we prayed for him and he said brother I I go to church here locally um but but I don't know something just led me to just come in here and get you guys to pray for me and so we just did what you know if he was there well praise God we gave him he he said he said could you give me something to eat as well so he said I want to also take it to my mom so we gave him a a plate to eat and uh um and he just went on his way you know apparently he lived just around the corner but uh just those things like that you know just seize the moment you know when those those those those times come um these these sisters and these Brethren that came uh also these young people um there was they were given uh clothes as well brother brother Donnie Reagan's Church provided a bunch of clothes for them um they were also given the little books I believe that sister uh Monica has downstairs for the young people walk with me I think it is Bunches of those were given in Spanish to them uh they had we had activities with them um so it wasn't just uh ministering to them but it was activities with them as well just dealing with them uh so uh we we just had a really good time with with them uh some of them right there are heading back to their places this down here is when we were packing up there's the Jeeps that we were riding in packing up heading back to managa 7-hour drive and this is some of the terrain that we were Drive riding in some of it very really really rough and uh let me tell you riding side sideways on in a car like that it gets you really dizzy I mean there was several times we had to stop just because brother and they would they wanted a barf and and uh it's not like the same as if you're riding you know the way you usually ride in a vehicle so uh but uh we got back we got back okay and uh next slot we're almost done here this is some of the sisters they're cooking they cooked uh I mean they just gave in their gave in their what they had amen for the for the young people in that camp and this sister right here look how young to me she's very young she's got like eight children and and uh we prayed we prayed for all uh a lot of them would come up and she came up for prayer some of them had ailments but the majority of the thing that they always came up for is that pray for my spiritual life I want to be more like Christ and um one of the little girls she came up she didn't even she she was she was deaf and uh no she was dumb she couldn't she couldn't speak I think she was deaf too well brother Mike prayed for her and uh he asked if she could say something after the prayer well she tried died so but we we just believed you know that God was going to do something for this little girl well later on that that that evening she started you could see she was going around trying to talk to the people trying I mean it was like she was she was she they prayed for me I'm going to try you know I'm going to do and and and and her voice I mean she it seemed like she was saying things clearer than she was before the service at least that's what people were the people were telling me so hopefully maybe next time I get over there and she completely healed amen sometimes amen God doesn't do it right away may take just little by little amen but if you speak to this mountain it could be just little Little Rock by Little Rock but it'll happen if you believe amen uh there another slide uh and uh this is some of the young people they're getting clothes and uh I just really appreciate it for the things that they you get next slide uh this was in Costa Rica there some of the area where we were at this is uh in the camp in managa some of the sisters that cooked in Costa Rica and this is the area around where Co in Costa Rica where we were at the church is located at just real beautiful view next slide um this is at in the mountains and just praying for a sister there this is Brother Brad yon um he's from brother Donnie Reagan's church next slide um so that might be it so um so Saints I appreciate your prayers and I appreciate the the Satan battled us amen but we were able to to overcome amen I just I was I felt like I was there to do a job and I wanted to do the job and Satan was really hindered because it wasn't just me that got sick some of the other interpreters got sick too and some of the ministers that went there they started trying to come with something so I went down there and brother Tim cross was sick too so uh it was it was real rough but we we I believe God did what he wanted to do and uh a pastor last week called me the pastor brother Pedro and he two weeks ago he called me and he wants me to go down there in September and uh I told him I'd pray about it but he they're going to have a 4-day camp meeting that they usually have in September and so you pray with me on that that he wants me to be one of the speakers there so you pray with me that the Lord would just have his way because if I go down there I have open doors now to minister in Honduras to minister in Costa Rica Nicaragua um so it's opened up some more doors for for us Amen to do some of these young young Brothers they go to they take uh up to the mountains I mean remote areas I mean with there's no electricity whatsoever and they preach the gospel up there and everything and I told them I would love to be able to to visit with them one day to help them out they said you come anytime brother you come anytime we would we certainly use your help so amen Saints so I don't want to take up too much of your time if you want
