there t tonight and I want to I I wanted to go on but I want to we've been on what is a marriage and and I I want it to basic basically be on a weekend that we can cover uh like what is a divorce and uh who can divorce and what can take place and you know in God in the word and in the The Prophet's message you know we want to get it all in there together and then that way we can be settled in what we believe and and don't have any troubles you know and irregardless of who it hurts you know uh right a lot of things that hurt is the things that really helps after a while you know it it feels good later on right so we need to know that and we need we will'll try to Pi up Sunday and then we'll just go on from there and then when we finish up whatever we take of the uh what is a divorce and things we're basically saying now what is a marriage right and uh but then we will get down to what is a divorce and see what it really is you know in in the point of what we're trying to make but but I want you to pay special close attention tonight because this is what's on my heart all right uh brother Brandon will say a lot of things and and in saying them you know you you uh you wonder you know should he said it this way or should he said it that way or you know should the Bible had said this or should it had said that you know uh you know you wonder well then you come and find out that uh it was the only way it could be said right to be correct right you know now we'll get to it after a while where brother brand said eve committed adultery right now that's right well now how could she commit adultery before she had ever as the world thinks married to Adam or or connected in any way or any form so we've been dealing with those things you know and we'll see that the prophet knew exactly what he was talking about okay so let's go to Matthew 1:18 now the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise when his mother mared Mary was spouse to Joseph before they came together she was found with child of the Holy Ghost then Joseph her husband being a just man and not willing to make a public example was minded to put her away privately now notice she was a spouse they were engaged all right while he thought on these things behold the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a dream saying Joseph thy son of David fear not to take unto thee marry thy wife we quote that yeah you know we we really want that part to be late in but we don't look at verse 19 it said then Joseph her husband right we don't look at it that a lot of times we just dwell on uh Mary thy wife or that which is conceived in her of the Holy Ghost and she shall bring forth a son and thou shalt call his name Jesus for he shall save his people from their sins now all this was done that it might be fulfilled uh which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet said behold a virgin shall be with child and shall bring forth a son and they shall call his name Emmanuel which being interpreted is God With Us Now go to Second Corinthians Paul saying the 11th chapter verse 2 for I am jealous over you with Godly jealousy for I have espoused y you to one husband that I may present you as a Chase virgin to Christ now if I get time if I don't I hope you'll understand if you want them I've got them brother bandam said I'm jealous of you right I've espoused you to Christ right you know right see we're we're already espoused to Christ that's not only were we're espoused by Paul as to be the bride of Christ and thing but it's personal in this age that brother Brown said I've espoused you and I I'm I have a Godly jealousy about you he said that's why we stay with the word you know okay go ahead to to Ephesians 1 now if I have time we'll get to this in whom ye also trusted after yet you heard the word of Tru truth the gospel of your salvation in whom also after you believe you were sealed with the Holy Spirit of Promise watch which is the earnest of our inheritance till the till the Redemption of the purchase possession until the praise of his glory now that word earnest if I have time to get to the end of if it don't then you tie it together in the message that word earnest we only use it as like part payment right we talk about it as a part payment but the definition really and if I get time I'll get to it and give it to you but the definition of the word earnest is actually part payment but it means pledge right see when you go in you make a down payment on something you are pledging to pay the rest of it right so then we'll try to get it tied together and all that okay you may be seated the Lord had his Blessing to the reading of the word now may God be with each and every one of us amen you know all right now we have learned so far and been tying together all of the things to where that we could stay with the the Bible and the prophet's message and trying to learn what these words mean and we found that the word espoused Y is engaged engaged is betro you know all of those are the same words we used it gave it through the Bible showing how they were used in the Bible terminologies and and what they were doing now I've given these so much brother Joe's putting them on the Internet so that anybody else can can read them off but you know we look at things and we say well now um I believe because I've been taught okay that's what we've done we've been taught right and that's why the misinterpreted Theology and the problems with marriage and divorce that's right is because we've been Tau Tau a slanted view of the Bible and the Bible says exactly what it means it's all that's what I'm telling you right there it says it but what does it say Amen we we then we take our human interpretation and we translate that as to meaning what we think it should have said yeah right that's why you come up with misinterpreted theology but see we don't look at it as being that when we would consider that you're engaged see that when you're engaged all right but around said as far as God is concerned mention invisible unit of the bride of Christ paragraph 86 he was minded to put her away proudly see after he'd already engaged to her when you're engaged to her as far as God is concerned you're married to her that's right that's why I've cautioned you and I have ever since I've been Pastor here and we've spoke on this many many different times over the years you know like every four or five years or something I'll do a series on marriage and divorce because new people coming in and all and some have been here from back of the original ones when we would speak on it and you know you so you say well brother Dale you're right back where you was okay but maybe somebody else needs to hear it and maybe we need to think about it ourselves all right and so now to me the Bible and the prophet's message is saying that if you're engaged the word engaged is only used one time and there the Old Testament scripture that's using the word engaged it's basically a spouse or betro right all right that's the basic words that you will find in the the doing but now now listen brother Brown questions and answers 1964 8:30 the morning service and listen what he says I stood here because my own son sitting here that was promised to a girl and I said if if he never even had the ceremony that's what most people think a wedding a ceremony they don't think an engagement you know they don't say well well an engagement you it it they don't count that a wedding but the prophet did and the Bible does all right now we're going to see then why that it will say that Eve brother will say Eve committed adultery right right because she did amen see all right now so follow what he say and if he never even had he talking about bilip Pa now right the ceremony said over him no matter if he' ever live with a woman or slept with her don't matter where he slept with her live with her where he had the ceremony the girl or whatever it was when he made that v he's married he said Billy Paul or no Billy Paul said that's exactly right he's married when he made that promise now when a boy asks you to marry him and you accept you're engaged and as far as God is concerned you're married right amen now we've got the quotes in here we read about them we gave them there where he was talking about you know the in questions and answers 1964 uh 8:30 that was paragraph 165 this is paragraph 154 he said here's where you're really married you're married when you vow one to the other when you promise one another that you're that you'll take one another the justice of peace could give you a give you license that's legal terms of living together as husband and wife without being common law husband and wife but when you promise that girl and this you promise that man that you'll live true to him and you take him to be your husband you're married then y see engaged right all right we went through in Deuteronomy cuz a lot of people want to use that there in Deuteronomy you know of of the point of the the father being able to disallow The Vow we went through that the Bible said in the day right he Hearth it in other words immediately right amen upon hearing it he must go do it then right it may be a while but he must go do what he's doing right then see it's not people go along 6 months later make wedding plans and then come up and say well the daddy just allowed to the wed you said well that's talking about somebody that I know well truth is truth amen that's right whether it be you me or who it is amen I just read brother around said well Billy Paul right well he didn't have no problems telling the truth about it that's right but see an engagement is when a person asks you to marry them and you accept now if you don't accept that's not a weding that's right see so be careful what you do girls you young girls coming up keep this in your mind right don't make no vows that you don't intend to keep right and I like what Wade's been through on the series there of doing in the things like yet so what you need to do is you need to go back to your parents and say something to them about it right well they're old fol and they won't understand that's exactly right they're old fogy and they'll tell you like it is amen but you don't want it and you're going to pay for it right you're going to make your own bed hard and you're going to sleep in it if you have listened to old fogy grandma grandpa Mom and Daddy it might have been a whole lot different amen but you ain't going to listen and the one sitting here won't listen right he said brother Dale you're sure heart I'm exactly right you're not going to listen it's going to take God to deal in your heart to make you listen you and I didn't listen and the other won't listen that's right right well you're saying my daughter won't listen yeah you better hold on y you got a road to hold and you better tell them every day y hey don't do that yep don't do that don't make your vows cuz if you make your vows if a boy makes about you and you make about about you're you're done that's right Amen brother Brown said and I gave you the quote there the other day he said at least from now on he said you're married aren cuz you're married by your vows not when you vow the altar uhuh it's when you ask the girl and she accepts right amen now we're going to get into the spiritual with this in a minute and we're going to tryy to see because this is what keeps bearing on my mind I want us to see what really is is wrong with us and why organized religion is so wrong right amen I mean you know we don't have any problems with anybody out there but the system of the whole thing that's right you know not the people right the system of the whole thing is where the problem is at cuz that's what's taught them wrong that's what taught you and I wrong that's why we went out and done the things we done that's right but we're supposed to be in the day of trying to get things straight now I made a statement the other day and I better clarify it real good I guess and I I've made this statement so if not a new one somebody on the internet listening or not hearing before they wouldn't know it but there people sitting here know that I've always taught you one thing about these things you know I've always said it and I believe it I believe the grace of marriage and divorce had to come in the end time Amen to be able to set a people free amen so that there could be a change in a moment in a twinkl an ey everybody understand I'm snapping my fingers change change change amen I'm not talking about whether you're going into the Rapture by dying right right there will be people that are come up in the The Rapture and go that didn't know the truth about it that maybe me married four or five times sure cuz there no truth had been presented there right am all right but you see in this day so you can't take a man and four or five wives and type Christ right it doesn't work anymore right it's a man in his wife amen right type of Christ in the church amen all right now not wives right whole bunch it's a man and his wife singular all right brother R said polygamy is wrong that's in Daniel 70 weeks all right so that's why I say that if we can't get our marital situation straight here we're going to go by the grave amen right right and see it's definitely not like I keep telling you about the brother preach that time that that you New Birth took care of of everything well if it did why brother R have to preach marriage and divorce what was the purpose he wouldn't have had to preached it no see because he he Tak the new birth well well then maybe he means the New Birth when it's completed okay but the new birth can only be complet when the grace of marriage and divorce is accepted right that's it amen that's right and if a kiss is potential adultery Y come on how many of us kissed women and how many women in here kiss men that you're not married to right sure well he done a marvelous job there the other night with it showing what that man had to say about it my brother Rand said SE glans is in the lips we should get that series and finished matter of fact I want him to if he will to think about what he's preached and then make a summation all right put it in one sermon and go through and make a summation of it to where that they could put it on the internet for people to to where they wouldn't you know like me I mean I'm going along I'm trying my best to do an answer and preach and all and I just said one day you know I said if if you still got a marital problem you're not going in the change the change in a moment of 29 right I didn't say nothing about Rapture right but you see people say well I've got a America problem how can I do it if you'd listen to what I said right I was talking about the change in the moment of twinkling and ey that's right I said we die and go by the grave I said that 30 something years ago right right amen how many old ones remember that 35 or 40 years ago maybe 30 something I said there'll be a lot of people in this message in the end times that will have to die and go by the grave I'm not de christianizing anybody I said they will die and go by the grave because they can't stand here to make the change amen amen that's right and you may not have a marital problem that will cause that but there's one thing about it we got a marital problem it's got to be straightened up here amen there's not a straightening up in heaven when we get there no sir it ain't going to be getting up in heaven and running around oh I found my soulmate that come yeah you're m no no we're yeah we're not foolish amen let's don't be stupid about things amen let's be straight amen and some of those things I don't understand but I believe it anyway amen all right but you following me now so then an engagement we not to take unto thee marry thy wife now they were in spoused MH they had not lived together they had not went down and performed ceremonial vows in front of the public but they were as spoused right and you know what they would have done they would have killed her right sure had Joseph not taken her place amen right thank you Lord amen you agree with that amen amen if he hadn't taken her place they would have killed her if Adam had taken ease place right God would have destroyed her right right amen now we know it didn't happen so we know God has all of this already figured out amen he knows what's going to take place amen and he knows how to hand thing amen yes sir he knew his brother BR said what in the world am I going to do said I got people sitting here men women married three or four times right he said what can I do now if you'll study the message get in the seals I mean get in the questions and answers in 64 1 2 3 4 they four four books on it and get in there you'll find him saying you go on as you are because PL times have been you know things have been made all right before he knew some things but he could not come out and say it because would have been only a presumptuous point oh I got a revelation but when he come forth with a revelation have you ever heard a man talk and there's one thing in that marriage and divorce is always bothered me my brother Brandon would come forth and say a question in God's word right I know I know the answer of sure man questioned it not God right right but he didn't emphasize it that way and where can you find Moses his grace in the Old Testament right I've asked you to read invisible Union and and marriage and divorce until where we get into the word divorce because you see the word divorce is exactly reverse of the word marriage right I've emphasized that over and over right you make your vows that means you're married when you're divorced you're breaking your vows you sign pledge to break Break The Vow that you made y that's right you're not signing the pledge to to break the paperwork that the preacher done filled out and the licenses and and the the what was done recording down at the courthouse right you're taking away your pledge right that's a divorce y right let's be serious about it brother we have seen his star to come to worship he's talking about the word espousal and he said in the in the East it's the same as marriage is it's the same as betral they were spouse they were married and when that sacred vow between them was taken Deuteronomy 22:23 and you'll find out that when this woman and man agreed to be married yet they did not take the vows for months and you know what he saying they didn't go before and do the if they ever broke that vow they were guilty of adultery that's right they were espoused y they were just the same as marriage am the law only that gives you a right to live together to be not common law husband and wife right all right now I hope this coming down to enough to where that we can comprehend an engagement and have moved away from our thoughts of what an engagement really is or an spouse or you know and find out about a marriage and found out what it means to make those vows but don't make them children that's right until you know that's the right one amen which means a lot of praying a lot of soul searching boys don't make the vows Right girls don't accept the vows no sir right you're in this day when the girls want to make the vows well that's not of a headship form but just don't get tied up in all that amen you stay away from it you got plenty of life I know I've got in trouble by being this way I know it but I didn't know it we were talking to this people one night and and I had bluntly stated that I didn't believe in the girls or to be married at 16 and four kids by 20 I just made it plain cuz that's the way I talk nobody can't you say well brother de what you mean anybody need that interpret it I don't believe in getting married at 16 and you say well what about you and Nanny okay my wife was 16 and I was 18 but we was grown we proved it we've been together 53 years this coming August 7th and a great family that serves the Lord all right what you see you know they wind up yes it's four 54 okay better get right be 54 we used arget you say 52 I say 53 so now I've got behind a year all right but anyhow listen when you make a vow to somebody you keep that V that's right you because that's that's that's your V by your words you be justified and by your words you be condemned that's right amen this is not just play parties and just oh well it don't matter what I say well it does to God Amen it does to God right amen and he's the one we're having to deal with right not what some preacher says or what their thoughts are right but now listen what about it can you tie together this is the point I tried to make the other week and I wanted to make sure anchoring can you tie together the new birth with your marriage and divorce that's right amen can you tie together the Bible of and why organized religion is like it is and why is it that the world is in an adulterous form that's right you know what you got millions and millions and millions of what we call Christian converts in the world today but why would a prophet talk about a little bride chosen out of day right amen right out of all the world full of religious people that are wonderful people sure marvelous people work theirself to death y but yet a proph would call them go to Invisible Union and read it over and over and over right can you tie that together to see that's what I'm trying to do with the word engagement see because when a man ask a woman to marry him and she accepts they're married that's right all right now God come unto me all you labor and heavy laden and I'll give you rest am did not God offer salvation to the world yes you agree right now even though he knew that they would not receive it and not fulfill it and come forth and be a bride etc etc right we know that but yet he still offered it amen and what makes organized religion so wrong and come on let's get on right down where we're at it don't matter you say Methodist Baptist Presbyterian BR right amen I don't mind saying words like that right because the people of this message are more denominated yes than the organized religions are I don't mind saying that I'm I'm sorry I have to but it's the truth all right what makes people married to what makes it to where that God one day will destroy them is because they made a a vow when he when he made a vow he he asked y he put forth his pledge he went forth to offer salvation now watch what I'm getting at so you have to be real careful so you can say well now when they accepted him when he when he asked them and they accepted him did that make a marriage that made them married and that made him married to his vow right but like Eve it we get to in a minute what happened to her you see why in the Bible that it says it be in the last days that that the women will say you know uh seven women to one man's coattail right said let us take thy name see because they want to be religious sure amen they want to be churchy but what makes it wrong of where they're at because they're pregnated by the devil's lie right amen just as we'll read in a minute is what he done y she become pregnated by the devil's lie right right then she become pregnated by the Beast as far as the natural Act see if God makes a if he sends you an invitation and you accept that invitation and then you don't fulfill you part of it you know you don't keep your vow that's it you go off and live with somebody else what are you that's what I'm trying to get at you're engaged to a boy boy ask you you accept and then you go off and marry somebody else what are you yep you're an adulterous that's right you're a whn y that's what the Bible calls it right you more the Revelation 17 why is she a why doesn't God just say I don't need fol none of it no because he offered and they accepted all right we'll read in a minute where brother randam said that's what happened Jehovah divorced the Old Testament right if he divorced her he'll never take her back his wife that's Deuteronomy 24 cuz there some uncleanness caused it to happen he can't come back and take her Deuteronomy 24 read your Bible we went through it maybe not enough but but enough that you to understand you know that run around and said Christ bride went whing after man's ideas read invisible Union right these are not my words you say well how could Christ bride do it you ask the prophet he's the one that's saying the things but then you find out and come to find out what it is is really a so-call bride right why because they made their vows and accepted him but before the wedding ceremony could come they're done found pregnated by the devil right right right organized religion pregnated to people with the denominational isms right and they're an adulterous and an adulterous according to the Bible her husband is the first one to cast the stone you say you are you trying to say that God is mared right come on listen get it right in your mind he offered it yeah they accepted it then they went wrong right it's not that he went wrong he's right there to keep his vows amen that's right he's even there to bless them heal them deliver them right amen but what the problem is that they're married to him and then they went married the world that's right brother Mo back in about 1971 preached a series messages and I really enjoyed it it still bears in my heart are you married to Adam or are you married to Christ you know there is no divorce for a woman in the Bible n no what no grounds no nothing amen see the husband got to be dead y amen it's the only grounds a woman has for remarriage is her husband to be dead the brother R them in the marriage and divorce and it's not said to him but it's said to her right but now it ain't said to him like everybody wants to say it right even when the Pharisees we're going to get on to that when we get into the part of those Pharisees come to Jesus tempting him they said Moses gave us a right of divorcement to put our wives away for any cause so he didn't come out there and tell him wait just a minute no that's what brother dick and brother Ray and I were talking this afternoon you ever notice brother brandham when they asked him a question go to questions and answers and they ask him a direct question about something and he spends 30 minutes talking about it and he doesn't plainly tell you in plain blunt words black and white as we call it what the answer is he gives you the scriptures and the things that are related to it which should be the right answer but don't understand what I'm saying they asked him said brother Brandon said should women wear pajamas to bed and he just kind of giggled and ped It Off right it wasn't that he didn't want to answer it it's probably just too silly for him well do matter what women we up in bed oh but boy bless God yes I've been through it with heard it over and over the women wearing Brites you ain't never been through the long lines of these things and sometimes it gets PL vulgar to even talk about it but you know some of the preachers used to preach that women wasn't supposed to wear panty hoose because they had a crouch in them that's pling but that's the way people's done until people don't know what in the world truth is but you see somebody's trying to stand with the truth amen that's who I want to line up with amen all right get back on what we're talking about so let's just talk about this part of what makes a what makes a person what do you mean brother Dale cuz you go out and talk to organized religion people and you'll hear this right I accepted him as my savior Y and what else can I do huh well you accepted him what did you do different than what I done I he gave me the invitation and I accepted the invitation is't that what you done you remember the Baptist man had come to brother around him and said what else could the man do said Abraham believ God and it was imputed unto him for righteousness he said that's exactly right but he said God done something to Abraham amen that he gave him the sign of circumcision amen join he accepted his faith but do you understand what I'm saying when God offers the world salvation and then they say I accept it that makes them married to Jesus Christ come on you see yeah is he mad to them well it must be because he going to put them away in divorcement right and that's what he's got to do that's right and that's what he's done why because he accepts our words yeah but I just don't see how God could be married to a denomination he's not married to a denomination right he's married to individual people amen right brother ROM don't get it no where will you find brother R talking about God being married to an organized religion not going to get it a don't need even searching for it but he's married to individuals right who has accepted him as their savior but then they go off and live with another husband what is he going to do right divorce her because she broke her V let's see if we can just go through some of this thing and see all right go ahead brother Anderson pull up I told him we'd skip up 1 2 3 4 and we'll go up to number five look what the prophet had to say let me keep mind let me get my notes CAU up okay now watch what he said the end time sign seed 62 319 E12 that's what the bride has done with the world I want you why would he call him bride right but then why would he so emphasize that there's a little bride to come out of there right amen then why would he so emphasize on the seal book when he says I call you bride why because she'd been espoused some records had started being made clear about that time things was being cleared up yeah watch that's what the bride has done with the world United with the world with their Creeds and things and denied the word of God saying days of Miracles is p there's no such thing as the baptism of the Holy Spirit see you said well there's nobody in the message that says that I know I get in trouble when I do things so okay I'll get in trouble uh days of Miracles at pip one brother said the third pull is only far brother Bram and the Lord Jesus so that means the days of Miracles is p okay all right there's no such thing as a baptism of the Holy Spirit there's a big Doctrine in this message that you don't have the baptism of the Holy Spirit I just got through those doctrines and things right those heresies right amen so bring it on up to where we at okay bring the message up to where we at see we look back our say oh that was their problem well what's our problem look at it and where is she at now he say she's divorced y okay y now if they wouldn't married he wouldn't divorce her that's right so they were engaged they hadn't come to the wedding yet right right right but there engaged if you're getting what I'm saying they made their own vows and that vow are pledge is what made them married right why you can call him an adulterous look what he said just just Jesus's bride had done the same thing that Jehovah's bride did the same thing that that Adam's bride did you see yes just exactly the Bible said it the mouth of three Witnesses let every word be established there's three churches three Brides all of them done the same thing right all right going to the next one the sign of his coming 62407 paragraph E 101 remember Adam's bride was found with false seed that's exactly right now he didn't have no problem calling Adams Eve Adam's bride right yep he didn't say Eve was engaged no that's right right bride all right Adam's bride was found with false seed that's exactly right Jehovah's bride was found the same way right he divorced her and put her away is that right that was God Christ bride is that was God Christ bride is the same thing she's found with worldly organizational seed in her and not the gospel having a form of godliness but denyed the power thereof from the holy spirit in the world now what's it there's a sign of the last days God will divorce her and take his bride as concern certain as anything in here as it was in the days of no he's going to divorce all of this stuff out here and then he's going to take his real bride right is that what he's saying amen he's going he's talking about a bride a divorcer then he talk about's going to take his bride all right see that way you're not confused with the Bible right go on to the next one let's see what happened this is marriage and divorce 1965 221 the morning service paragraph 256 through 257 notice he can put her away but she cannot put him away right he did it has proved it in the days when Luther Wesley and Pentecost don't now where are they at right they're already divorced course right what's their problem they was married to him left went to another husband now they're an adulterous right right right so look what God's done with her look what he said happen now he can put her away but she cannot put him away he did it has proved it in the days when Luther Wesley and Pentecost when they refused to become the further part of him by having spiritual sexual fire to become pregnated with a f further part of the word you understand she refused the Lutheran Church refused Christ to have any more Desire with her you plain as your Prophet could say it Luther refused it now you not talking about Luther right right come on right you would have just read it now right said Luther no Luther was the bride right who he talking about the Lutheran he ain't talking about Wesley up here he ain't talking about those that were true Pentecost right come on read the message oh you're interpreted and we say just what he said he must a hypocrite look the Lutheran Church right y refused for Christ to have any more desire of her Luther refused it let me say this want to call me something anyhow so is it today with every one of the they fail to take that word they refuse Christ any woman that refuses a man his child now back up here he's talking about they refuse to have spiritual sexual a fire to become pregnated with the word now he's talking about down here what they're refusing a child right right come on and any woman that refuses a man his child has no right to be a wife to him amen you remember in the Bible when the King married Esther watch because the queen refused he just got him another one and when the what happened when she refused to come out with the King and Obey him the same thing it is when a woman that refuses to be wife to her husband amen now plain language is timeing together what's timeing together an engagement makes you married makes your husband and wife it don't complete this transaction it only Begins the transaction and you must go on all right and that's why Peter would say that the new birth Y is just the earnest of your inheritance right until the Redemption of the purchased possession all right so the new birth comes in and Abraham the seed that was made alive and when does the new birth begin when does it actually begin it begins when you accept Jesus Christ as your savior right amen but it's not complete until he gives you the baptism of the Holy Ghost right right that's right all right but now in engagement it's already finished irregardless of whether you ever have anything else to do right that's what I'm trying to tie together and Earnest a pledge listen Church we're in a dangerous situation whether you believe it or not that's right we come to Lula and we claim Lula's got the word and you never said it that way other of you have I've always just tried to preach a word right amen but where do we stand compared with all the rest of the message people but you see church we could be just as filthy in adulterous as anything else because if we take any of our ideas is contrary to God's word we're an adulterous right that's why it's so serious to stand here and preach the gospel that's right if I deny one word what am I right I'm a bastard born illegitimate child read spoken words Original Seed and see if he's right I got them L on the dment it didn't bring them because I knew I wouldn't have time to even cover what I want to on this look think about it look what he says on invisible Union paragraph 153 down through 157 now he shows us what the new birth is doing because the new birth is that you died to the old husband if the old husband ain't dead we remember an indivisible Union we'll get back to it later when we using the word it's not divorce him and hang him up no that's right see a lot of people as brother Mo said got their coat and hat left organized religion and come into this message y same old coat and hat that they wore when they was in organized religion same old Doctrine right you see them in the message all the time Mormons Y what two Souls Y no baptism of the Holy Ghost is that one of them back in there about somewhere just before you come into the the Pentecostal that they didn't believe in the baptism of the Holy Ghost congregational whole I mean well Church of God one them come through there now if I say that wrong you forgive me and put the right one in the right place but one of them come in there you know and said they didn't believe in the Holy Ghost he shot spoke in tongue that was a devil well I've been here where not here in this church but in this message I've heard preacher say take uh 1 Corinthians 11 I believe or 13 which one where the gifts that turn them out and throw them away cuz ain't no good no more turn them out your Bible well you know what I done I done told you what I done and I would have in it I said give me your Bible if you don't believe in it I'll rip it out for you boy he took that Bible and took tail I would have been glad to bought him a brand new Bible but I was going to rip that out of his cuz he said it wasn't no good why is it we can't say strength strong and why is it when we do that we're not wound up to be the bride of Christ we're wound up to be a devil that don't agree with everybody yeah come on Church where's it at so to be married to the second Adam Christ the word you must separate yourself by Death from your first first denominational husband that's right you said no I just got born again but you see church we were married to organize religion whether you want to agree with to it or not what do you want to believe and say well I was back there but I didn't know what you're talking about I don't make no difference when they said do you accept you said yeah I accept that's it it don't have to be explained it's done so listen cuz there isn't one of them that can take all the word of God y now what about 90% of the people just mess you come on I'm not against people I'm against you know I'm against the things that's Turing people down amen just show me where that one is at oh you say mine the other fell says his too put them together and you'll find out they're both wrong soon as you denominate read Revelation 17 see so you see you've got to be dead from that thing right now I'm not speaking to this local assembly I'm speaking all together Across the Nation you must be dead to your first husband if you're United to Christ and still married to a denomination in other words if you claiming you're married to Christ and still got a denominational idea organized religion or thoughts right come on is that what he saying look what he calls us M if you're United to Christ and still married to a denomination you're an adulterous right yep you're a lady of sea he said now there was a time lady o was the bride yep right right but then when the message come forth what' she do she refused the message that was brought by the prophet and she died you know she she was an adultery she divorced right a church across the country we're following Jesus Christ the word to be in the bride you have to be remarried to the word of God which is Christ in the beginning was the word the word was with God and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among as long as you hold to man's tradition of denominations you are called in God's word and adulterous come on as long as you're a denominational Creed seeking Seeker belonging to a denominational church that denies the word of God you're an adulterous what the Bible said come on come on what about in this message now I'm not preaching nowhere's else we're not back under I told you while to go Luther and them done made theirs they done been organized and died they were they were divorced put away right come on the seed of God can't be in you can't be in him the same time at the same time listen the seat of God can't be in him the same time the love of God the love of the world can't be there right you reading it is in there when the seed of God is operating through you that's the word of God the love of God can't be in there at the same time now where is the short hire and the shorts and the painted faces nowh is it at you see why people don't want me to preach they go to churches where they're beat to death about don't do this don't do that and don't do this and don't do that and do that and your bde you C now brother brandom doesn't have no trouble putting short hair shorts painted faces as being an organized religion right you see why people don't want me to preach on it because it dechristianize every one of us come on folks you can sit there and stone me to death yeah it ain't going to work that's right I'm going to preach it anyway you're the one that's going to answer for your stone facing amen that's right you cause this church to fail and you're going to answer for that's right amen but you've been warned over and over and over amen that's right but listen brother ROM calls organized religion shorts and hir and dress and stuff like that that's right he says that's living with the devil Y and there's women right here that's embarrassing to look down at the front of them sometime because the breast is showing that's and then you look down on the other end and the knees is showing y now church that's worse than organized religion that's right you can get mad at me do what you want to maybe we won't need to build another part of a building one day maybe I will get Stern enough start preaching it but I try my best to do it in love amen and try to get you to see the love of God that order to cleanse our hearts and our life that's right right if my wife lives true to me because that she's afraid I'll divorce her there's a problem amen right sisters that's right do you live true to your husband just because you're afraid he'll divorce you or is it because you love him that's right well what what about Christ right amen what about Christ what about it look what he says on the next one cuz it's hurt down where we're at right and paragraph 175 invisible Union how can a preacher goes out here to a seminary and looks at acts 238 and see that there's not a person in the Bible ever baptized in these those titles and then still says he's pregnant ated with the word of God telling you a lie he sold his Birthright he's committed adultery against the very thing that he said he is put away in divorce Y come on preachers that's right deny the word we're put away in divorce right come on because we made our vows right okay look at the next one questions and answers um don't wrong on the Top Line 6 28e okay we missing something at the top it U because it's 628 e okay these numbers is not comparing up here on the top cuz that's not 6 6559 see that you know okay we get on this on it's the paragraph anyway he said we got one more now now listen I want to ask you a simple question and hope you'll see what I've been trying to talk about married to organize religion or whether we've been married two or three times or whether we've been engaged two or three times you see they argued with brother brandom and they said fornication and adultery brother Brown said the words the same that's what I want to do approve for the next 15 20 minutes CU even the garden as I said when we started her and Adam had not come together as husband and wife physically right why would he have not called her fornication are you thinking why does not the Bible and the prophet called her fornication called her adultery so you're going to have to change the Bible because Jesus said if a man looks on a woman un lust in his heart he ha committed fornication with her already now did I misread quote that right what does the Bible say a man looks on a woman to lust in his heart he's committed adultery right why is he saying those things why is the Bible saying why is the prophet called Eve committing adultery because she's engaged I hope that'll tie to you one of these days you'll understand when Eve was in gave to Adam you said well they didn't have no no they didn't but she was betr right well well no wait just a minute now he didn't say will you take and he said no no they didn't have to cuz there was only two of them right they wasn't a whole group standing around try to bicker over who's going to do what you said well can you put it with betral they pledged yeah because when she came out what did Adam say come on what did Adam say she's bone of my bone and Flesh of My Flesh they were engaged as spous betroth right right and she committed adultery no no no fornication she committed see that's where you're holding to the point of thinking fornication is somebody before marriage and adulter is after and that's fine CU that's the definition that's right but get the real definition right we went through there in in numbers that if a man find a girl betrothed and he rape her in other words lie with her they killed him if she didn't cry out to kill both of them why because she was betr right but then we covered the scriptures on down a little further that covered that if she was not betr or spous and he lay with her he could go make a deal with her daddy in B we done been through that right why because she was not a man's wife but if she was betr she was a man's wife Eve was Adam's wife whatever you want to think about it took to consummate that or finish it up if you want to think it was sex that made them married well you better believe in a hurry she committed adultery cu the Beast beat Adam D so come on she's married to the Beast then if you're going to make it marriage like that better think right amen all right but now listen to your prophet claim fornication and adultery but just think about what he's already said then we'll get to some more y they said brother Brandon what's the difference between fornication and adultery he says 1959 628 the evening service paragraph 185 what is the difference between fornication and adultery Matthew 199 CU it's used in Matthew 19:9 it's used fornication and adultery is using the same scripture you know on we'll get to that later Jesus said in Matthew 199 whosoever put away his wife and marries another except it be for the cause of fornication commit adultery we'll get to those later I'm not trying to deal with that I'm trying to deal with the other point the difference between fornication and adultery the word could be applied either way so to make it clear what he was talking of there and a woman that's unmarried cannot commit adultery okay that's what 100% correct y y right but if she's engaged she's married that's right that's 100% correct now can you put the two together amen come on the word could be apply either way but to make it clear what he was talking about there a woman that's unmarried cannot commit adultery why because she's a young girl she's not guilty of doing it she's she's not married she's not engaged come on right if she's not engaged then the man that if she volunteered for him then it's fornication right did you understand the way I said it isue volunteers right it's fornication other words a girl that never had sex and never promised nobody to married and a and a man come comes along the first thing is fornication why because she doesn't have a husband right but he had one that's right so did Jehovah the Old Testament people had a husband so did the Bride of Jesus Christ have a husband I'm trying to get that to tie together to you so look because she has no husband to commit adultery against it's unclean for her she has to confess that to her husband before they are married and she did she's did that if not and her husband finds it out later he has a right to put her away because she took a false Vow where the Bible says rituals all right for the Bible says it okay look at the so fornication is what a girl when she lives unclean that's fornication cuz she has no husband but when she's married and then when she lives like that she commits adultery against her husband so don't go with that uh Eve would be fornication I know it calls it fornication against Jehovah's bride right but she was committed adultery because she was married to Jehovah don't call it fornication to the bride of Christ call it adultery amen why because they was married right that's why he puts him away all right now let's just prove that let's go to to marriage and divorce 19 be me to it now listen what's what he we know that it was Eve the Apple that she was supposed to eat where it's not even scriptural now they claim it it was an apricot it was neither one she committed adultery y now if you're anchoring down on what I'm saying you're understanding they were engaged married so she committed adultery had she not been engaged had she not been betro pledged to Adam it would have been fornication right come on but it's adultery because the wet came so it with the church come on she committed adultery that brought forth the first child that was Cain Satan own son or in him lay evil he did not come through Abel Satan's son was Cain okay go to the next one which is the invisible Union 1965 11:25 paragraph 229 how did you come to do this we were deceived into it by your first marriage to your adulterous parent oh now I want you to read this one real good and then you'll see that there is no good lineages right you know in this message see there's a Doctrine if you happen to be born from Adam you can be saved but if you come from the Beast you can't be saved now I'd like to see that in the prophet's message right come on you on the internet send it to me I'd like to see that right read what he says Y how did you come to this you were deceived into it by your first marriage to your adulterous parent Eve what it's no fault of your own by your natural birth you come after Eve who committed adultery y that's the reason you were born in adulteress yep come on y we were born in adulterous you're a siner to begin with that's right you were deceived into it see that's why we need to be born again amen and to be born again go back to Invisible Union and read it over and over to be born again the old husband got to be dead not divorced and put up in a corner right not take your coat and hat run into the message until I got the Holy Ghost that's right that's what most of the people claim well where's the husband died right you see why most people don't have the new birth right cuz their old husband's still alive that's right their old doctrines their old ideas yeah but brother de wouldn't marry back her let's get the last one let's see what the prophet had to say 74 invisible Union bride of Jesus Christ marriage is the oldest Institute in the world marriage was first was performed first and instituted in the Garden of Eden right that's not after the Beast got there no right that was why Eve is called an adulteress that's why you and I are called an adulteress that's why we've got to be born again amen that's right you see even though we're born again we only have the engagement situation I gave you the quote from the prophet so you can give a quote where brother R say we're married to him right now we are right exactly what I proved Eve was married to Adam sure right when you accept Jesus Christ as your savior and he gives you the baptism of the Holy Ghost you're married to him amen that's right right and then to take any man's ideas besides what he tells us we're adulterous that's right that's why the marriage and divorce situation is like it is Christian people trying to interpret the word of God right most of the time to fit their own Goods if you've ever heard and read the story of any of it to where it come down to the King James version I saw a movie one time where that they was depicting King James as and even the man said on it he says and that's what my brother said he' done I differ totally I mean not alltogether but King James was trying to get a Bible that would okay him to get married or been married I don't give a who that's what he wanted it for he brought us the word right that's right I don't care if it come from the Latin vate they brought us the word right amen my brother says King James wanted to set it up where he could divorce or already divorced or where it'd be okay whatever it was that's the stories that goes with the King James version but what do I care we got the word of God Amen right even though it come right through the adulterous hands come right down into us right we have God's word amen but the new birth is only the earnest right right amen the new birth is only the earnest The Pledge engagement the prophet said we're going to get married at the wedding supper amen I gave you one I to see a book where he said all that six seals going on we going to be up PR getting married when we already married now right he was married right Joseph and Mary was married amen but a day came when they consummated that right and it had to be 9 months later because he knew are not until the child was born amen I know I'm kill you a lot of things but you know you'll take this wrong but that's all right you know that' take a pretty good man to live with a woman for 9 months without having intercourse and them already married as far as the world was concerned they went on down and and done their vows they went on through with the we sure it shows that God was in control but it also showed that it can be done that's right amen it shows that God can do it through a man amen sir Joseph was a wonderful man amen you see church when are we if we're engaged we're married amen but there parts of this it ain't finished yet we got to put on the wedding garment amen we got to do all of the things put that there where we can make sure and write it downstairs amen W because we're engaged amen going to a wedding in the sky but God says I'm married why can't I say I'm married right why can't I say that's my husband if you'll notice over in the Book of Revelations brother dick I used to talk about this a l it finally does say it doesn't say that a bride has made herself ready doesn't say that why because at that time you're going away it says the wife has made her seated she went from a point of being an Engaged right she's went to that form to write here upon this Earth before we're changed somebody's going to be the walking Living Word of almighty God that's right and he can come and Unite with it right it won't be any man's ideas of traditions or thoughts right that's why churches I warn you constantly about these doctrines well that's all right that's a good brother yes so was the devil that's right here what people will say to me but brother you want not be so hard they don't understand well why don't they ask right come on why don't they ask right I stood here since 1974 and preached Daniel 70 weeks never been invited but to one place to preach it then who wants to know about Daniel 78 I didn't write the book your Prophet says in there if you don't understand Daniel 70 week you can't understand the seals I didn't write the book he did yet everybody knows the seals and all about them but what about Daniel 7 what that's right well bless God you go down to the courthouse and you can't find where I've been married at one time how many times was he engaged right right how many girls do you ask and they accept you come on I don't like you I don't like me either no problem with that we got a 100% agreement but what does the word say that's it that's it that's right I bless God so and so righte far so and so just remember the reason organized religion is is where they're at today is because when God put the welcome out sent come out to them they accepted it and when they did they went off and lived in adultery just like Eve did amen it's like Eve that was engaged to Adam and she went and live with a beast just like Jehovah went whing after the things of the world and God right there with them just like the prophet said the bride of Christ he said that's why he didn't say down through the all the ages of the putting away he made it specific he said the Luther and the Methodist and Pentecostals refuse to become pregnated with the furtherment part of the word amen why don't we want the word folks is it condemning us right does it condemn you for somebody to tell you the truth it doesn't change a person God's the only one that can change a person it doesn't change a person in the world ain't never change nobody my wife my kids my nobody in this church has never changed anything what I said it right God has to come into your heart and show you what the truth is amen amen and that's why I Don't Preach like everybody else cuz if I did I'd beat us everyone to death dechristianize us all and empty the church but instead I keep trying and praying God let me say something that'll get to people to see it I let don't get to see that they're engaged amen going to a wedding supper we've got to have the grace of marriage and divorce to get us clear right that's right amen now come on if you need the grace of marriage and divorce for natural how much more would it be for the spirit so read invisible Union listen to that message over and over and see that around said the old husband got to be dead that's right he said not hung up in the closet come on Church you got enough sense to know what he's talking about you see the people of this message come in this message and bring their old doctrines that they brought you've been here with me and you've heard me name them over and over Mormon Doctrine badst ideas come right down through Doctrine after Doctrine after Doctrine show you that they come from organized religion brother R said they all denominations started in Eden bless God I believe the prophet's message amen what has it done for you and I right have we fallen in love with the master that brought the word to or have we fallen in love with the man that delivered the master that's it when is it come on be L take on these things earnest is a pledge right am so when you receive the new birth you brought it down to a pledge yep you're engaged yep you brought it to a place that now you're married to Christ brother around get an invisible union he said out there flirting around
