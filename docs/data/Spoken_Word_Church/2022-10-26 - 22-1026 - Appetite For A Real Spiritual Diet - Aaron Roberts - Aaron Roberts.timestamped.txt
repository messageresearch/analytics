[11:52] clear but sometimes you just come by and
[11:54] show how these Miracles have taken place

[12:32] in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen
[12:36] Genesis chapter 2 we're going to start
[12:38] at verse 15.
[12:41] and tonight
[12:43] got a brother Louise always seems to
[12:46] like my my sermon titles he I always
[12:48] have tonight I'm going to preach on an
[12:51] appetite for a real spiritual diet
[12:56] and uh because you know what
[12:59] um y'all may not y'all may not know this
[13:02] but if you extracted all of the parts
[13:04] out of the Bible that talked about
[13:06] eating and food and dietary laws and
[13:09] everything like that there wouldn't be a
[13:10] whole lot left in the Bible
[13:12] yeah
[13:14] you know
[13:15] so
[13:18] what's that
[13:22] no we're going to get on we need to get
[13:24] on the right kind of diet
[13:28] but see you know and it's how you look
[13:30] at it
[13:33] as as somebody was saying Sunday it's
[13:36] the right mental attitude to the any
[13:38] Divine promise that God will bring it to
[13:40] pass
[13:40] amen so this is Genesis chapter 2 verse
[13:44] 15 and it says in the Lord God took the
[13:47] man and put him into the Garden of Eden
[13:49] to dress it and to keep it and the Lord
[13:52] God commanded the man saying of every
[13:54] tree of the garden thou mayest freely
[13:57] but of the tree of the knowledge of Good
[13:58] and Evil Thou shalt not eat of it for in
[14:01] the day that thou eat us thereof Thou
[14:04] shalt surely die
[14:06] in Matthew 4 4 says but he answered and
[14:09] said it is written man shall not live by
[14:12] bread alone but by every word that
[14:14] proceedeth out of the mouth of God
[14:16] in John chapter 6
[14:18] we're going to begin at verse 28 there
[14:22] and the scripture says
[14:24] then said they unto him what shall we do
[14:28] that we might work the works of God
[14:30] Jesus answered and said unto them this
[14:33] is the work of God that ye believe on
[14:35] him whom he has sent they said therefore
[14:38] unto him what sign showest thou then
[14:41] that we may see and believe thee what
[14:44] does thou work
[14:46] our fathers did eat Manna in the desert
[14:49] as it is written he gave them bread from
[14:51] Heaven to eat then Jesus said unto them
[14:53] verily verily I say unto you Moses gave
[14:56] you not that bread from heaven but my
[14:59] father giveth you the true bread from
[15:01] heaven
[15:03] see they kept looking back
[15:07] but they they were missing because the
[15:09] day of visitation was the day that they
[15:11] were living in
[15:13] for the bread of God is he which cometh
[15:15] down from heaven and giveth life unto
[15:17] the world then said they unto him Lord
[15:20] Evermore give us this bread and Jesus
[15:23] said unto them I am the bread of life he
[15:26] that cometh to me shall never hunger and
[15:28] he that believeth on me shall never
[15:30] thirst but I said unto the you that ye
[15:34] also have seen me and believe not all
[15:37] that the father giveth me shall come to
[15:39] me and him that cometh to me I will in
[15:42] no wise cast out amen God bless you
[15:45] tonight
[15:46] you may be seated
[15:49] and
[15:52] you know
[15:55] like they say diet's a four-letter word
[15:59] and you know just like a lot of other
[16:01] four-letter words it's a it's a touchy
[16:04] subject
[16:07] but I just want to
[16:09] you know share a few things with you
[16:11] tonight and
[16:12] like I said this is kind of
[16:14] geared to the to the young people but
[16:17] you know I was I was looking at some
[16:19] things and
[16:21] this is I was doing I was reading some
[16:24] things and um
[16:26] just some interesting things that
[16:29] stood out to me
[16:31] um I was reading a article that was
[16:33] talking about a study that was done by
[16:36] the University of Washington
[16:38] and they were the in the study that they
[16:41] were talking about
[16:43] your diet has more effect on you than a
[16:46] lot of other things and according to
[16:48] this study that was done a poor diet
[16:51] kills more people globally than tobacco
[16:55] high blood pressure or any other risk
[16:59] that's associated
[17:00] with a person it all goes and they said
[17:03] according to the CDC
[17:06] 45 of all illnesses and problems that we
[17:10] have in the human body is directly
[17:12] related to a sub optimal diet
[17:18] so if you don't have a very good diet
[17:21] then 45 percent of
[17:24] the health care is being spent trying to
[17:27] take care of people
[17:29] and
[17:31] just looking at uh
[17:34] I was looking at some at some data and
[17:37] according to uh some of the research I
[17:40] was doing the health food industry
[17:45] is it makes up now this is not Health
[17:48] Care this is just health food
[17:51] Health Care is over 800 billion dollars
[17:55] a year and in three years it's going to
[17:58] be over a trillion dollars
[18:00] they expect just the money that we're
[18:02] spending on health care but on just on
[18:04] health food and wellness the industry
[18:07] vitamins and and all that kind of stuff
[18:10] right now that industry is
[18:14] 298 billion dollars a year
[18:17] and it's worth the worth of the health
[18:21] food and wellness industry is
[18:24] 841 billion dollars
[18:27] they spent a lot of money
[18:30] in health care and wellness and selling
[18:33] new vitamins and supplements there's a
[18:35] lot that's tied to that
[18:37] so your diet has in the natural has a
[18:42] lot to do with your health and your
[18:44] wellness and the condition that your
[18:47] body is in
[18:48] and I was just looking at some of those
[18:50] things and it just kind of
[18:52] when you start to think about that
[18:53] that's quite a
[18:55] staggering
[18:56] numbers when you when you look at those
[18:59] things and I was just really amazed at
[19:02] that but you know
[19:03] food and you know food and diets is a
[19:07] big thing that you know we all have to
[19:09] we all have to live and we all
[19:11] we all have to talk about it and you
[19:13] know we always everywhere you go there's
[19:15] advertisements and you can't go anywhere
[19:17] without somebody and uh I was thinking
[19:21] the other day that
[19:24] you know lots of times when people get
[19:26] into
[19:27] talking about food
[19:29] you know some of the some of the
[19:31] earliest Jing you know
[19:33] commercials and things like that that's
[19:35] the first thing that people remember is
[19:38] songs that are and Jingles that are
[19:40] associated with food
[19:42] and you know I was I was thinking you
[19:44] know how many little kids you know the
[19:46] first thing you know and little kids may
[19:49] not even know what they're singing about
[19:50] but you know what they know who Oscar
[19:51] Meyer is
[19:54] they can sing about baloney and they can
[19:57] sing about a hot dog
[20:00] but you know I mean they get why because
[20:01] they I mean those are little things like
[20:03] that people get those jingles in their
[20:05] minds why because you feed on that
[20:07] and so it feeds right in to food
[20:11] you know there's there's uh young young
[20:14] ladies in in this church tonight and if
[20:17] you go to social media
[20:19] uh some of these some of these ladies
[20:22] they have really uh
[20:25] nice social accounts and they put all
[20:27] these nice little pictures of food and
[20:29] they show you preparing all this food
[20:32] and uh I've made some inquiries on some
[20:35] of it I was like you know it's really
[20:36] bad that y'all put all these pictures on
[20:38] there but we never get to see any of it
[20:40] we never get to try any of it I figure
[20:42] if you're gonna put pictures on there I
[20:44] mean I think it'd be nice for y'all to
[20:46] bring it
[20:47] you know I mean that's just that's just
[20:49] me and brother Wade but you know I mean
[20:51] we'd like to we'd like we think y'all to
[20:52] do that you know that's that's just kind
[20:54] of bad you just put all these pictures
[20:56] on there but uh maybe maybe one of these
[20:59] days they'll they'll think about us and
[21:01] and bring us something but you know I
[21:03] mean ever everybody everybody deals with
[21:06] food I mean it's in your diet
[21:08] and every time you go to the doctor
[21:09] that's the first thing they won't do
[21:11] they're asking you about you know I
[21:13] don't know about y'all but that's the
[21:14] first thing the doctor looks at me and
[21:19] it's like you know you're you're not
[21:21] you're the ideal weight for somebody
[21:23] that's seven and a half feet tall
[21:25] or eight foot tall or whatever you know
[21:28] but you know at least at least I am not
[21:30] ideal weight for somebody
[21:32] but you know I mean everybody deals with
[21:35] with food and and diet and
[21:38] you know all of these things all tie in
[21:41] together about strong in the natural we
[21:43] all everybody talks about and so is it
[21:45] the same way in the spiritual
[21:48] to deal with the the body
[21:52] brother and uh Matthew 5 Jesus says
[21:56] blessed are they that do hunger and
[21:58] thirst after righteousness for they
[22:00] shall be filled
[22:02] and so you know we all have to have a a
[22:06] diet we all have to eat
[22:09] you know I think about sometimes the
[22:11] first thing that happens after Wednesday
[22:13] night service and I'm not mentioning any
[22:15] names but you know who you are the first
[22:18] thing to do when they get out of here
[22:20] and they won't they hear they got one
[22:22] word on their mind
[22:24] how many it's cookout
[22:26] we're going to cookout cookout cookout
[22:28] cookout
[22:30] that's not good that's not a bad thing
[22:32] you know I like cooking but you know I
[22:34] mean that's that's the thing and I know
[22:36] because you know if I get up here and I
[22:37] start mentioning food and diet then you
[22:39] know what summer I'm gonna lose some of
[22:40] you I know that
[22:42] because y'all will have your minds on
[22:44] other things
[22:46] because it'll it'll affect your bellies
[22:48] and it'll affect your mind but that's
[22:50] but that's okay we'll we'll get through
[22:52] then
[22:53] but you know a diet
[22:55] but I I I'm laying all this as a
[22:57] background because it's important as we
[22:59] see all these things in the natural we
[23:01] got to see these things in the spiritual
[23:05] because you know blessed is he that
[23:07] meditates on the law day and night
[23:11] and you know he said he shall be as a
[23:13] tree planted by the rivers of water
[23:16] and so all of these things tie into the
[23:18] natural tying in with the spiritual
[23:21] now this is from the message the
[23:23] entombment I'm going to read a couple of
[23:24] quotes here from from the message and uh
[23:27] just kind of just kind of lay a
[23:29] foundation now brother Brian says in
[23:32] from the message entombment he said now
[23:34] notice Jesus invested with all the
[23:36] powers of God but when he met Satan he
[23:39] never used any of his powers he only
[23:41] referred to the word
[23:43] he did he said it is written man shall
[23:45] not live by bread alone but by every
[23:46] word that proceedeth out of the mouth of
[23:48] God then how can you how can you stay
[23:52] home
[23:53] that you can say you can stay home and
[23:55] be just as good a Christian as you would
[23:58] be at church you can't do it read the
[24:00] word amen the Holy Spirit feeds on the
[24:02] word the Bible is God's spiritual diet
[24:04] for his church and the Holy Spirit is
[24:07] the one who brings it to you and places
[24:10] it in the heart and with Thanksgiving
[24:12] you water it and every Divine promise
[24:14] will produce just exactly what God said
[24:16] it would do it's got to it's his word
[24:18] and its life
[24:21] and from the message this is this is
[24:24] coming from the message the water of
[24:26] separations here and Brethren was
[24:28] speaking of
[24:30] hey speaking of leprosy
[24:32] and you know he talks about the two
[24:34] turtle doves when in the Old Testaments
[24:36] you know when they found uh leprosy in
[24:39] the house you know when the priest had
[24:41] to shut it up for seven days and then
[24:43] when he went in you know they had to for
[24:45] purification they had to had to take the
[24:47] two turtle doves and and they killed one
[24:49] and they dipped it or sprinkled the
[24:51] blood on it and they released it but you
[24:53] know they had to do all that for the
[24:54] sanctifying of the house and you know
[24:56] they had to get rid of all the you know
[24:58] if they was leprosy that was found any
[25:01] on any of the dwelling of the house the
[25:03] rocks or anything like that they pulled
[25:05] all that out and threw it away they had
[25:06] to be put in an unclean place they had
[25:08] to get rid of it and replace all that
[25:10] and you know the high priest had or the
[25:12] priest had to come in there and he was
[25:14] the one that had to give them the okay
[25:16] to go back in the house they were
[25:18] separated and cut off until the high
[25:21] priest give them the okay to go back in
[25:23] and now this is from the message of the
[25:25] water separation and brother Brown I'm
[25:27] speaking of here and he's talking about
[25:29] the uh the doves and and he says and one
[25:32] dog was killed and this and put Cedar
[25:35] and Scarlett hits up and the hyssop
[25:36] sprinkled the living bird the living
[25:38] bird was taken out in a field and turned
[25:40] loose and when its Little Wings was
[25:42] fluttering and flying out like that that
[25:44] the blood of its dead mate on it was for
[25:46] a cleansing of leprosy which the type of
[25:48] sin was a type of the church but the
[25:51] blood of the Savior the the Lord Jesus
[25:53] Christ who died in your state and the
[25:55] blood cried holy unto the Lord amen the
[25:57] blood sprinkling the ground holy holy
[25:59] unto the Lord a cleansing of leprosy I
[26:01] just learned some from medical research
[26:04] the other day what Leber sees caused
[26:06] from the wrong diet that's what causes
[26:08] sin is the wrong spiritual diet it
[26:10] causes an eating leprosy that only God
[26:13] Alone can cure
[26:15] so that was kind of a thing that you
[26:19] know just looking at some of these
[26:20] things and so we understand that how our
[26:22] diet
[26:24] is is an important thing
[26:26] and what we eat is important
[26:29] but you know
[26:32] one of the things that
[26:34] when we when we look at
[26:36] it it's not just it's not just having
[26:40] the diet
[26:42] but you know a the word appetite is the
[26:46] reason I put the word appetite in there
[26:48] is because the word appetite is a desire
[26:52] is a longing
[26:54] and so you know God gave the children of
[26:57] Israel
[27:00] he gave them the most perfect food
[27:02] brother said the most perfect food that
[27:05] they could have was manna
[27:07] and he he took care of him and he
[27:10] brought them all the way and he and he
[27:12] carried you know brought him into the
[27:13] end of the journey bringing them into
[27:15] the promised land took care of all their
[27:17] needs but he gave them exactly what they
[27:20] had need of which was manna
[27:23] and but you know the people began to
[27:25] complain about the manna
[27:28] here was here's the most perfect food
[27:30] that they had but you know what they
[27:31] didn't have a desire for it
[27:33] her brother and says you know when they
[27:35] when they came out and the first thing
[27:37] that they could do was look back to
[27:38] Egypt and complain oh if we didn't have
[27:40] garlic if we didn't have some leaks you
[27:44] know all the great things that we had in
[27:46] Egypt
[27:47] and we loathe this like bread
[27:50] here we are we're eating what God is the
[27:53] most perfect food the most perfect item
[27:56] that you could eat but the problem was
[27:58] they had no desire for it
[28:00] and we know that you know God sent quail
[28:03] and you know God killed them because
[28:05] they're they're they're
[28:07] unthankfulness for what God done for
[28:09] them
[28:10] right I mean you know when God does
[28:12] everything for you and you know when you
[28:14] when you see
[28:16] in this journey when they were walking
[28:18] everything that they had need of God
[28:19] took care of and when when he brought
[28:22] them out
[28:24] and you know because one of the problems
[28:26] that they had was they had to get the
[28:29] mentality of being slaves out of their
[28:31] mind
[28:32] amen when night when they were being
[28:34] beat by the task Masters and they were
[28:36] under that bondage when all they could
[28:38] say was the the sovereignty of the
[28:41] Egyptians when all they could see was
[28:43] the greatness of the Egyptians you know
[28:45] they were bound
[28:46] but you know there's somebody had to
[28:48] come and they had to believe what Moses
[28:50] said he said by a strong hand
[28:53] but he said listen he said he said your
[28:55] father Abraham walked in this land
[28:59] he walked in all this
[29:02] right and he said that's where you're
[29:03] going to you're going to this land
[29:06] and he said guess what he said he he
[29:08] made a promise to Abraham he said he
[29:11] said that your Offspring your
[29:13] descendants would sojourn in a Strange
[29:15] Land but he said I'll bring them out
[29:18] and all those years that they had been
[29:21] down there
[29:22] and no doubt there were some of them
[29:24] that were still there telling them about
[29:26] the great the great king the great man
[29:28] Joseph
[29:30] who was next to pharaoh and the great
[29:32] things that he had done
[29:34] now they kept rehearsing those words in
[29:36] the ears of the children of Israel the
[29:39] problem was is the Egyptians forgot
[29:42] where they came from
[29:43] when God came on the scene and saved
[29:46] their lives
[29:47] when he fed them
[29:50] when the word came to Joseph in the
[29:53] midst when the when the Pharaoh was
[29:54] troubled with his dream and they came
[29:56] and he gave them the interpretation of
[29:58] how they were going to save themselves
[30:02] and how the Fulfillment of of Joseph's
[30:04] dreams to his brothers how how that he
[30:06] saw them bowing down to him
[30:09] and even his father
[30:11] when Jacob saw that and and saw he was
[30:15] greatly loved and understood him to be
[30:17] spiritual
[30:18] understood Joseph to be spiritual in a
[30:21] prophet when he understood that and then
[30:23] he said what do you mean that I'm going
[30:25] to bow down to you
[30:27] but it was still the truth
[30:30] it was still the word of God it still
[30:31] came to pass
[30:33] and when all of those when they came
[30:35] over and and he said I'm going to raise
[30:38] up one that's going to bring you out by
[30:40] a strong hand
[30:41] And yet when they see all those things
[30:45] it's amazing that they actually
[30:47] went through all 10 of those plagues hit
[30:51] hit Egypt and they saw each one of them
[30:54] here they are in Goshen and they're
[30:56] looking over there and seeing Darkness
[30:59] when they're in Goshen and they're in
[31:01] safety and they see
[31:03] that when they see the wrath of God
[31:06] being poured out on the Egyptians and
[31:08] they're looking over there and they're
[31:09] seeing the destruction and they're in
[31:11] safety and they're seeing that they're
[31:14] seeing what God is doing for them and
[31:16] yet when God tells them that it's time
[31:18] to get up and go
[31:20] what's the first thing that he does and
[31:22] when they when the when the death of the
[31:24] firstborn came then what was it what was
[31:26] he told him under the under the uh law
[31:29] under the Commandment that Moses had
[31:32] given them under the time that they were
[31:34] going to leave he said this night he
[31:36] said the the slayer's coming through and
[31:38] they said he'll kill all the firstborn
[31:40] man and beast but he said you must take
[31:42] a lamb a perfect lamb and set it up and
[31:46] he said not only for your family but
[31:48] your neighbors whoever for the eating
[31:50] the size of the Lamb each person must
[31:52] eat their portion there's a portion of
[31:54] this lamb this and he said when you take
[31:56] this and he said then you have
[31:57] unleavened bread with it he said you
[31:59] come with your shoes on your feet you
[32:01] come with a staff in your hand and you
[32:02] come and you eat it he said you roasted
[32:05] with the bitter herbs he said a roast
[32:08] the whole thing by itself
[32:10] you know he said I couldn't I couldn't
[32:12] imagine taking a whole animal
[32:16] usually what we have the we have the
[32:17] decency to take all its intros out but
[32:20] here they put every it had to be
[32:22] completely whole
[32:24] and had to be roasted
[32:26] and then they had to eat that
[32:28] why because you're not going to do away
[32:30] with any portion of it you have to take
[32:32] the whole lamb
[32:34] it must take the whole works all of it
[32:36] has to be together and when they ate
[32:37] their portion then they were being
[32:39] brought out
[32:41] but see here they they had to get a they
[32:43] had God had to get them accustomed to
[32:45] understand it was what was going to take
[32:46] place why because they had a mentality
[32:48] of being a Slave
[32:50] and then when they came out and they
[32:52] began to go on the journey but the first
[32:54] thing they had was complaints and they
[32:57] brought them out and they come to the to
[32:59] the Red Sea and even Moses getting
[33:02] messed up in his own commission when God
[33:04] began to speak to him he tell him what
[33:06] was going to take place he said Don't
[33:07] Cry To Me Speak the word and go forward
[33:09] why because you've been ordained to do
[33:11] this
[33:12] and here they are walking across the dry
[33:15] land
[33:17] two million people two and a half
[33:19] million people walking on dry land and
[33:21] passing through the great sea the Red
[33:23] Sea that was you know this great sea
[33:25] that had been opened up to him and here
[33:27] they are walking upon dry ground
[33:30] but they couldn't get they couldn't get
[33:32] Egypt out of their mind
[33:34] but you know we see all those things
[33:36] that God done he brought them all the
[33:37] way through and he began to deal with
[33:40] them and trying to get but you know what
[33:41] they still had a desire of the things of
[33:43] Egypt they still had to desire the
[33:45] things of the world
[33:47] yeah why because they never had a dis
[33:50] they never had got an appetite for what
[33:52] God was giving them
[34:01] right and see this is this is from the
[34:03] the message
[34:08] from the message thirst brother Brown
[34:10] says
[34:11] he said no there is nothing can satisfy
[34:14] that thirst that's in a human being
[34:15] until God comes in he must have it or
[34:19] die and no person has a right to try to
[34:21] hush or satisfy that Holy thirst that's
[34:23] in him by the things of the world no sir
[34:26] it's ungodly to do so and if you thirst
[34:28] for God don't shake hands with the
[34:30] preacher and put your name on the book
[34:31] if you're thirsting for God there's only
[34:33] one thing to satisfy it that's me God if
[34:36] you're thirsting for God that's the only
[34:38] way you can meet him is to do that he
[34:41] said then there is a great danger also
[34:43] if you don't watch what you're doing in
[34:45] that time if you're thirsting for God be
[34:48] sure it's God you find say be sure that
[34:51] it's your thirst
[34:53] it's satisfied but if Satan has been
[34:57] able to pervert you
[34:59] from these natural appetites that he'll
[35:02] do if he can he'll make you
[35:05] he'll simply make you try to be
[35:07] satisfied
[35:09] so say that
[35:12] so we must know that we have a must have
[35:14] a desire for these things and only God
[35:16] can give you the desire for those things
[35:18] but you know he said Every Man was
[35:20] created with the desire inside of him
[35:22] you've got a thirst inside of you you're
[35:24] going to find something that's going to
[35:25] satisfy that but it must only you got to
[35:28] make sure that you find God
[35:31] and and one of the things I I want to I
[35:34] want to speak about tonight and it was
[35:36] just something that's been on me is you
[35:38] know this this time of of the week
[35:43] you know we're getting ready to go to
[35:44] camp and
[35:47] you know so many times I I've heard not
[35:50] only here but other other young people
[35:52] and the first thing that they start
[35:53] talking about is you know they start
[35:55] getting ready for camp and it's not just
[35:57] packing a bag
[35:59] and it's not just you know getting ready
[36:01] and making plane tickets or getting
[36:03] ready you know however that they're
[36:04] going to travel or all those things but
[36:06] you know the first thing that they start
[36:08] doing is they start getting their mind
[36:09] and it's not just seeing their friends
[36:11] or or looking at boys or looking at
[36:13] girls but you know they start getting
[36:14] their mind on God
[36:16] because you know there's lots of times
[36:18] when kids go to Camp the first thing
[36:20] they start talking about is and I
[36:23] one of the one of the reasons why I came
[36:26] to me was I was thinking about brother
[36:27] Andrew Glover and you know he was
[36:29] talking about being a young you know
[36:31] going to youth camps and everything and
[36:32] he was talking about being a Louisiana
[36:33] Camp one time and you know he said this
[36:35] was my year
[36:37] he said he went he went to Louisiana
[36:39] camp with a full expression the full
[36:42] intent of receiving the baptism of the
[36:44] Holy Ghost and he said this was he said
[36:46] it was my year and he said I wasn't
[36:48] leaving until I got it and he said when
[36:50] he went down to that camp in Louisiana
[36:52] and he said they started that prayer
[36:53] line and he went through that prayer
[36:54] line he said the Lord got a hold of him
[36:56] the Lord touched him and he said never
[36:58] been the same and so he had it in his
[37:01] mind to do that and so that's the first
[37:03] thing you got to do you've got to get it
[37:04] in your mind and lots of times when when
[37:07] the young people they start getting
[37:08] ready to start going to Camp the first
[37:10] thing that starts happening is when you
[37:12] start thinking about going to Camp the
[37:14] first thing to do is the devil's going
[37:15] to sit on your shoulder and he's going
[37:17] to start talking to you
[37:19] he's got it he's already tonight no
[37:23] doubt he's already been talking to you
[37:24] because when I mentioned going to camp
[37:27] and the Lord's wanting to speak to you
[37:29] the first thing the devil's like he
[37:30] ain't talking
[37:33] yes I am the Lord's talking to you
[37:37] if you if you buy if anybody says well
[37:40] I'm not sure well let me tell you I if
[37:43] if I don't I'm I'm praying for I'll try
[37:45] to get to it tonight but listen if if
[37:48] I want you to understand if you
[37:50] understand what God is speaking he's
[37:52] speaking to you
[37:54] how many times have you have you known
[37:56] young people they start getting ready to
[37:58] go to camp and the first thing they get
[37:59] sick
[38:02] how many of them all of a sudden they
[38:04] start trying to get ready for camping
[38:06] and the first thing that happens is they
[38:08] get the sniffles or they get some kind
[38:09] of illness or whatever the next thing
[38:11] you know the first thing that pops in
[38:13] their mind is you're not going to be
[38:14] able to go to camp
[38:17] well let me tell you something we're
[38:19] going to pray and no no we're not
[38:21] praying just just for the ones that are
[38:22] here I mean we're praying I've been
[38:23] praying for the whole Camp because you
[38:25] know what we're gonna we're gonna we're
[38:27] gonna back the devil up we're going to
[38:29] put the devil in his place
[38:31] because you know I want you to
[38:33] understand that because God is God is
[38:36] speaking to you because today is your
[38:38] day of visitation
[38:40] and you know and I you know we're I'm
[38:44] going because I see there's a I I really
[38:47] was really honored that brother Jason
[38:48] actually texted me and asked me about
[38:50] coming to help and I was like hey I'll
[38:52] do whatever I can
[38:54] it's an honor
[38:56] but you know everything because every
[38:57] every part every part has to be imported
[39:01] whether whether anybody sees you or not
[39:03] that's not that's not the case there's
[39:05] there's so many things that take place
[39:07] behind the scenes that nobody gets any
[39:09] any glory for any roses or any
[39:12] recognition for but you know what
[39:13] they're still vital to this thing taking
[39:15] place
[39:16] and and just and just like everybody
[39:19] says well what can I do
[39:22] you can pray
[39:25] that's the main thing
[39:27] whether you got any kids or not
[39:29] any any grandkids anybody going to Camp
[39:31] you can still pray
[39:33] we're going to hold them up and believe
[39:35] that you know because I believe I
[39:37] believe that God wants to do something
[39:38] for the people
[39:41] and so we're going to because I believe
[39:44] I believe we go up there this weekend
[39:46] but I'm
[39:48] so yeah there's a lot of things out even
[39:50] like today you know let's not let's not
[39:52] get to the point now where we where
[39:54] we're waiting on tomorrow
[39:56] the Lord's speaking tonight
[40:00] so if the Lord's speaking tonight then
[40:02] you don't have to wait till tomorrow or
[40:03] Saturday night or whenever it was you
[40:05] know the Lord's speaking tonight the
[40:07] Lord's speaking to your situation right
[40:08] now
[40:10] but but I'm saying that when we get
[40:11] ready to go to camp
[40:13] it's just like any other any it's just
[40:15] like coming to church on Sunday morning
[40:17] having the same expectation that God's
[40:20] going to meet you
[40:23] but you know so many times that the
[40:24] devil he's going to attack you and he's
[40:26] going to start telling well you're not
[40:27] you can't make it and and your life's
[40:29] not going to change and and you know
[40:33] all those things and you know you're not
[40:35] going to get anything and and you're
[40:37] just going to go and you're just going
[40:38] to come back you're just going to feel
[40:39] good and you'll come back and you'll
[40:41] have the same you'll fight the same
[40:43] battles and you'll have the same
[40:44] failures and everything but no
[40:48] so what if you go to camp and the Lord
[40:50] speaks to you
[40:54] because it whatever takes place whatever
[40:57] happens then you know what
[40:59] it's still you still got to face that
[41:01] day of that devil you still got to fight
[41:03] that battle
[41:05] you know one of the things I was I was
[41:07] thinking about when when I was looking
[41:09] at this was you know my own personal
[41:11] experience
[41:13] you know I
[41:15] I thought I was doing okay
[41:19] physically
[41:20] every now and then my heart started
[41:22] racing and bouncing around and you know
[41:24] I I didn't sleep very good sometimes but
[41:27] you know I thought hey I'm okay
[41:29] I'm doing pretty good
[41:32] you know I I felt tired but hey you know
[41:35] that happens a lot of times and a lot of
[41:37] times I just started thinking well I'm
[41:39] just getting older
[41:42] and so this is this is one of the things
[41:45] that I I want to look at tonight but you
[41:47] know I started I started feeling like
[41:49] well I'm starting to get a little older
[41:51] maybe maybe this is the problems and and
[41:53] all this kind of thing
[41:55] but you know
[41:57] as as it began to progress
[41:59] I was like hey I got to get I got to get
[42:01] looked at
[42:03] just for my own personal peace of mind
[42:06] but you know what the devil said on and
[42:08] he kept telling me
[42:09] and
[42:12] I listened to brother Jason Watkins
[42:13] sometime back
[42:14] and brother Jason was talking about
[42:17] he would get out and walk get out and
[42:19] walk in the mornings walk a track and
[42:20] everything get out exercise and he said
[42:23] every so often he said he kept feeling
[42:24] that pain in his chest and he's but he
[42:26] said any other time he didn't have it
[42:27] but he said he got walking he started
[42:28] feeling that pain and it would hit him
[42:30] that same pain all the time
[42:32] and he said they finally found that
[42:34] blockage in there and you know just the
[42:36] hand of the Lord they got the stent and
[42:38] took care of everything but you know it
[42:40] was like you've got a heart problem
[42:43] you've got a heart problem
[42:45] a lot of people don't know this but my
[42:47] mom's dad passed away at 44 massive
[42:50] heart attack
[42:53] and you know that's the first thing when
[42:54] you when you think about Grandpa gray
[42:56] pass and you know that's the first thing
[42:57] the devil puts in your mind
[43:00] dad passed away of a stroke you know a
[43:02] complications from a stroke and you know
[43:04] it's like you know all the all the
[43:06] things that run in the family
[43:08] and it's like well you know what you've
[43:11] got a big dose of it buddy
[43:13] but you know what I just had to keep
[43:15] putting that down
[43:17] I just had to know no no no no
[43:19] you're a liar and the father of it ain't
[43:21] listening to you but you know he kept
[43:23] coming back
[43:25] so I went to the dock you know I finally
[43:27] I just say listen I gotta get this thing
[43:28] checked out because this drug I didn't
[43:30] sleep one night no so the next day I was
[43:33] going to the doctor and they started
[43:34] looking at me and then this one day
[43:36] they checked me out said hey ekg's fine
[43:38] we don't see any problems
[43:40] but they wanted me to go to the hospital
[43:41] I had to go to the emergency room they
[43:44] wanted me to get checked out
[43:46] and the first thing they start doing is
[43:48] you know they want to run everything and
[43:50] hook you up and
[43:52] I got to stay up all night and spent 20
[43:55] hours in the hospital running them
[43:56] running tests and and drawing blood and
[43:59] giving you vitamins and
[44:01] and all you know going through all of
[44:03] that process and then they told me that
[44:05] hey the next in the morning you're going
[44:07] to have a stress test
[44:10] and
[44:12] I thought I was gonna Dive In
[44:15] they put me on that you know they lay
[44:16] you on the machine and they done the
[44:18] echocardiogram and the lady said you
[44:21] know from what she everything looked
[44:22] fine but anyway then they put you on how
[44:24] you hop on this uh treadmill and we're
[44:26] gonna go and then keep walking walking
[44:28] and they just keep speeding it up faster
[44:30] and faster and faster and faster and
[44:32] faster I think they wanted me to get my
[44:34] heart rate up to 170 beats per minute
[44:37] and I got there
[44:39] and then as soon as then you got to jump
[44:41] off that thing get back on the table so
[44:42] they can scan your heart again but you
[44:45] know everything I praise the Lord I'm 48
[44:47] years old I ain't got no heart problems
[44:49] everything come out perfect there was
[44:51] nothing there was nothing that they
[44:52] could find anywhere in in my in my whole
[44:55] body that was wrong
[44:57] as far as my heart and I thought praise
[44:59] the Lord
[45:01] but the only thing they found out when
[45:02] they first started drawing blood
[45:06] they said
[45:08] your A1C is elevated
[45:10] which is your blood sugar
[45:12] and so they think you know they started
[45:15] checking that and uh
[45:18] but it was it's so amazing that I didn't
[45:20] I didn't realize that at the time but
[45:21] you know uh elevated A1C causes cardiac
[45:25] arrhythmia and I didn't know that you
[45:27] know you learn things all the time but
[45:28] you know I I said all that to say this
[45:31] you know I thought I was fine
[45:34] and I could have just played off my
[45:37] symptoms
[45:38] and I could have just went on about it
[45:40] and I thought I was okay
[45:44] but let me tell you something
[45:46] I I testified today and I've told other
[45:49] people I thought I was okay but I didn't
[45:51] know how bad I felt until I started
[45:54] eating right
[45:55] which they got me on medicine and they
[45:57] and everybody asked me I said no the
[45:59] doctors have said that I'm diabetic I
[46:01] never said I was diabetic
[46:03] now that's what they put on me
[46:05] and that's and that's that's their old
[46:08] that's their test that's not my test but
[46:10] you know because I got two I got for
[46:12] first pick you know second Peter 2 24
[46:14] and first Peter 2 24. he said my stripes
[46:16] we were healed so you know that's what
[46:18] Dr Jesus said so uh hate Trump say any
[46:20] other doctor from any other medical
[46:22] school in the world but
[46:24] um but you know I you know I do what I
[46:27] told her like pop always said just do
[46:28] what they tell you to do
[46:30] so they they want me to take medicine I
[46:32] take medicine
[46:34] but you know I just started watching
[46:36] what I ate
[46:38] now sometimes it's hard sometimes it's
[46:40] not too hard
[46:42] because you know what I see a greater
[46:45] goal
[46:47] I see I see something better and it's
[46:48] like hey you know what it's like you're
[46:50] gonna have to cut out carbs and it's
[46:52] like well that's okay because I used to
[46:53] drink a Coke every day or a Sun Drop
[46:57] actually with Dr Peppers most of the
[46:58] time but but you know I you know I go
[47:01] days and days and days without drinking
[47:04] any soda at all I don't drink any salt
[47:05] drinks at all days
[47:07] and I drink one every now and then
[47:10] but you know I you know because after a
[47:12] while you get to the point where you
[47:13] don't need it
[47:15] and there's no taste for it
[47:18] and so I don't have I don't desire it
[47:21] never now and then but you know that's
[47:23] like me you know I don't I got I got two
[47:25] leaders at the house but you know I
[47:27] don't have to drink all two liters at
[47:29] once
[47:30] I drink like eight ounces and I'm good
[47:34] and I and honestly I and I I'm just just
[47:37] the way that I am I just don't like diet
[47:40] drinks
[47:42] uh you know because I know some people
[47:44] and I drink one every now and then I get
[47:46] one down but you know what I would just
[47:47] much rather drink water
[47:50] because you know and and that's that's
[47:52] another thing that we have a problem
[47:53] with
[47:55] and and and and the natural and the
[47:57] spiritual is that you know the way we're
[47:59] going to fix a problem is we're going to
[48:02] artificially synthesize something we're
[48:05] going to make something artificial to
[48:08] replace something that God put in the
[48:09] ground
[48:11] and then we're going to make this stuff
[48:13] and then we're going to give it to you
[48:16] and then we're going because well guess
[48:18] what you can drink Coke
[48:21] and we're gonna say well it's got no
[48:22] calories in it it's diet it's these but
[48:25] you know what people don't realize that
[48:28] you know
[48:29] I was reading I was reading an article
[48:31] and they said you know one of the worst
[48:32] things that you can do if you get on a
[48:34] diet is drink diet drinks
[48:37] and you know why because people get out
[48:39] there and they want to try to speed up
[48:40] their metabolism to burn calories and
[48:43] you know what when you drink a diet
[48:44] drink it slows your metabolism down
[48:49] and so you know the best thing for me is
[48:51] hey just don't drink them at all because
[48:52] you know what then you know what because
[48:54] there's nothing because you know what
[48:55] you can't find carbonated water like
[48:57] that in in the ground
[49:00] like like Amanda said one time he said
[49:02] if you you know if you find natural
[49:03] things and talk about sugars and and
[49:06] sweet things and like that and he's like
[49:08] you know the best thing you can eat is
[49:10] honey
[49:11] get you some honey
[49:12] put it in your coffee put in your in
[49:14] your oatmeal or whatever that's what
[49:16] that's why because that comes from
[49:18] nature
[49:20] and God what God made you can't you
[49:23] can't replicate it
[49:25] and to be the best as as it was then
[49:29] and all the things that God made are is
[49:31] perfect
[49:32] just like the word of God it's perfect
[49:34] and so if you want something all you got
[49:36] to do is get what God made
[49:40] you know I I was reading a reading an
[49:42] article and they were talking about the
[49:44] um
[49:46] the Romans
[49:49] and they said you know the the Romans
[49:51] when they when they find these these
[49:52] mummies and and they start looking at
[49:54] these uh bodies from from
[49:57] hundreds of years ago they were talking
[50:00] about how how well preserved their teeth
[50:01] are
[50:03] and they said you know the reason why
[50:04] because their bodies because their diets
[50:07] were so low in sugar it didn't destroy
[50:09] their teeth
[50:12] but you know we got people that just
[50:13] that consume so much of that and it just
[50:16] tears their body down
[50:18] and so as it begins to tear you down
[50:21] then you I didn't well hey you know what
[50:23] that's all right we've got cosmetic
[50:24] dentistry to fix that problem
[50:27] when the the problem is is you know if
[50:29] you didn't have it in the first place it
[50:30] wouldn't be a problem
[50:35] but see this is this is from the message
[50:38] God being misunderstood and brother
[50:40] Brown says
[50:41] and he's speaking of the gifts of being
[50:44] in the body
[50:45] and he says maybe maybe I can help you
[50:48] climb the ladder just a little bit
[50:50] higher and get a little closer to God
[50:52] with it
[50:53] and said it more in order in the church
[50:55] he said I've been watching all along it
[50:58] seems wonderful to me and I just love to
[51:00] see it move on and on and on and on and
[51:03] on
[51:03] and as we're coming up he said don't let
[51:06] Satan creep in now
[51:08] they said boy he's smart don't out with
[51:11] him don't try to because you can't you
[51:14] just depend on God and just keep walking
[51:16] humbly God will do it and you'll find
[51:19] out that God will use you more and more
[51:21] and more like that the Lord bless you
[51:25] see when God gives us something then we
[51:28] use it we yield to it but don't try to
[51:32] as he said you know try to outwit him
[51:36] and as he was speaking you know
[51:39] Satan he's going to try to creep in
[51:42] so these little things that that come
[51:44] your way you know because it's the
[51:46] little foxes that spoil the vine so when
[51:48] these things take place then we need to
[51:50] watch even be more uh open to
[51:53] understanding what's going to what's
[51:54] taking place and keep our eye to be more
[51:56] Vigilant on what's going on around us
[52:00] so when you when you see these things
[52:02] and so tonight and are opening our eyes
[52:04] and understanding hey the devil's going
[52:07] to come against you
[52:09] because you know what if the Lord has a
[52:12] blessing for you and you say hey I'm
[52:14] expecting a blessing then you know what
[52:16] the devil's going to stop you
[52:21] so
[52:22] and this is this is from the message
[52:24] Father the hour has come and brother I'm
[52:26] speaking
[52:28] and and he's speaking of
[52:31] Jehoshaphat and Ahab coming together and
[52:34] you know
[52:36] you know
[52:37] joining forces to to fight the Kings and
[52:41] and everything
[52:43] but you know when Ahab wanted wanted
[52:46] Jehoshaphat to come you know Ahab had
[52:49] had his All His prophets and every one
[52:52] of them spoke the same thing
[52:54] oh the Lord's with you the Lord's gonna
[52:56] it's gonna be a great battle and all
[52:58] this kind of stuff
[53:00] but you know what every single one of
[53:02] them no doubt got up and rehearsed
[53:05] everything they were supposed to say so
[53:06] it was just a bunch of cookie cutter
[53:08] words and each one of them got up and
[53:09] said the same thing
[53:12] and they said to on and on and you know
[53:14] what there was just something about all
[53:16] that that wrong Hollow to Jehoshaphat
[53:20] something didn't sound right to
[53:22] Jehoshaphat and all of that right
[53:23] because everything that they said was
[53:25] just wrong
[53:27] and that's what he said he said is there
[53:28] is there not another one that in this
[53:31] land is there not another prophet
[53:35] which you know that just really said
[53:37] Ahab back he's like yeah we got another
[53:40] one
[53:42] but I hate him
[53:44] he ain't never said anything good about
[53:45] me
[53:48] jealous if that's you know he's like hey
[53:50] that's the one I want to hear
[53:52] that's the man I want to hear well let's
[53:54] see let's see what he's got to say
[54:00] amen and he said
[54:03] so he says brother Brown says in other
[54:05] words
[54:06] he went back to the old landmark
[54:09] so he's speaking about him going back
[54:10] and looking and searching out for the
[54:13] the word of the Lord he said he said
[54:16] Jehoshaphat had purpose in his heart to
[54:17] serve the Lord and to cling the things
[54:19] that his father David did at the
[54:21] beginning
[54:22] he said at the beginning he said in
[54:24] other words he went back to the old
[54:25] landmark and then they cleaned out the
[54:27] rose he said it would be good for
[54:30] Pentecost to go back to the old Landmark
[54:31] it would be good for all of us to go
[54:34] back to the old landmarks and clean out
[54:36] the rose what would happen today I'm
[54:38] talking I suppose mostly the Pentecostal
[54:40] people here in this afternoon he said
[54:42] what would happen if actually the church
[54:45] went back to the old Landmark you talk
[54:47] about a cleaning up there'd really be
[54:50] one around a Pentecostal Church
[54:53] it sure would now how many knows that's
[54:57] the truth why sure it is
[54:59] that certainly would be a certainly a
[55:02] Reformation going on
[55:04] oh how people would be acting different
[55:07] dressing different talking different if
[55:09] we could all just together different
[55:11] church just being altogether different
[55:13] church if we went back to the old
[55:15] Landmark where we started from
[55:19] and then he drops down
[55:22] and he skips talking about the landmarks
[55:24] and bypassing our our Theology and he
[55:27] said and that's what the churches need
[55:29] today he said as a Garrison of the old
[55:32] time Apostolic teaching so this lukewarm
[55:35] formal and up and up in and out up and
[55:37] down doesn't get in our church what'd I
[55:40] say that's right though that's right we
[55:42] have permitted too many things to creep
[55:44] in Brethren too many things that we have
[55:46] left the old Landmark from the beginning
[55:48] to creep in he said we never garrisoned
[55:51] the church
[55:52] and now we got everything in it that's
[55:55] right all isms and hisms and everything
[55:57] else in the church because we never
[56:00] garrisoned by the word
[56:03] and so I want to share this with the
[56:05] young people because when I when I saw
[56:07] this you know it struck me because
[56:09] there's so many young people
[56:11] and I'm not just speaking to our young
[56:13] people here but I'm talking about the
[56:14] young people around this message in
[56:15] general I've seen so many of them
[56:17] they've go to camp
[56:18] and the Lord do something for them
[56:21] but they've allowed the devil to steal
[56:24] their victory why because you did not
[56:27] Garrison yourself
[56:29] by the word
[56:30] because if the Lord planted something in
[56:33] you then you Garrison yourself behind
[56:35] the word and you stay fortified behind
[56:37] it and then you stand up and then
[56:39] whether if you did fall back and whether
[56:42] you know whether you did commit
[56:43] something and everything like that you
[56:45] know what he's faithful and just if we
[56:47] commit if we go and confess our sin he's
[56:50] faithful and just to forgive us and
[56:52] clean us from all unrighteousness the
[56:54] problem is is we will allow the things
[56:56] that have happened in the past to hold
[56:58] us back and we won't go any further but
[57:00] you know the thing is is if we if you
[57:02] fall and you fail then guess what God is
[57:04] there to pick you up and dust you off
[57:06] they put you back on the narrow way then
[57:08] guess what get fortified behind the word
[57:10] and then let me tell you something
[57:12] brother sisters if you've got a problem
[57:13] if you've got a failure if you've got a
[57:15] need then that's what the body is for
[57:17] not for you to tone all your problems by
[57:20] yourself not all your burdens by
[57:22] yourself but you know what we work as a
[57:23] body we work as a team and so we work
[57:25] together that's why you're gonna be like
[57:27] I pray for you you pray for me well
[57:30] because well you can't be an island all
[57:32] by ourselves
[57:35] and so we've got to carry these things
[57:39] and so so if God's done something for
[57:41] you in the past and you've gotten a
[57:44] little bit cold or whatever clean out
[57:45] those rows like he said go back to that
[57:47] Foundation go back to that Landmark the
[57:50] place that God LED you from if you know
[57:52] that what God has done for you in the
[57:54] past and guess what that's where you go
[57:56] back to you pick up from that standpoint
[57:58] and you continue on don't worry about
[58:00] what what because we're going to have to
[58:02] put all the things behind us and walk
[58:04] and press toward the mark of the high
[58:06] calling in Christ Jesus we're not going
[58:09] to have to worry about all these other
[58:10] things all the peripheral things need to
[58:12] be put aside
[58:14] why because if you if
[58:17] if you have confidence in in in me or or
[58:21] brother Wade or brother Dale if you've
[58:23] Got Confidence since if you had if you
[58:25] had belief in me that that I would do
[58:27] whatever I could for you
[58:29] I was thinking about Mercy word mercy
[58:33] oh Mercy's in the back but you know uh
[58:36] I've done that down at brother ismail's
[58:39] Church there's a little little boy on
[58:40] the front row and I had some money in my
[58:42] pocket and I was like you know this is a
[58:45] little little brother up here I said he
[58:47] don't know me from anybody he's never
[58:49] seen me and I had to get the brother to
[58:51] tell me what his name was I can't even
[58:52] remember Elijah or something Jeremiah or
[58:56] something but anyway uh I asked him I
[58:58] said do you I mean would you come up
[59:00] here I mean would do you trust me to
[59:02] come up here do you have confidence you
[59:04] ain't never seen me before you don't
[59:05] know nothing about me but do you believe
[59:07] that if I told you something you'd
[59:09] believe me
[59:11] I told Mercy that time you know did she
[59:13] come up she come up to the front and
[59:15] it's like you don't like being up here
[59:16] and she's like nope
[59:19] but you know the thing is I wanted Mercy
[59:21] to see something but I wanted everybody
[59:22] to see that
[59:25] I preached the message being Fearless in
[59:27] the world of fear why because the whole
[59:28] world's full of phobias
[59:30] brother said the psychiatrist or
[59:32] doctrine the psychiatrist
[59:35] but you know the one thing I wanted her
[59:37] to say I was like if you could see
[59:39] now she was looking back at the
[59:40] congregation but I told Mercy I said if
[59:42] you could see
[59:44] that you're looking at and you're
[59:46] nervous and you're scared because you're
[59:48] like
[59:48] but I said if you could see the love
[59:51] that they have for you you would not be
[59:55] in that situation you wouldn't feel that
[59:56] way
[59:58] if you could see the because know the
[1:00:01] love that everybody in this congregation
[1:00:02] has for you
[1:00:05] and that's that's to say you have the
[1:00:07] same have that same mindset and you know
[1:00:09] I told her I said you know do you
[1:00:10] believe she come up here
[1:00:12] and she didn't want to but she did
[1:00:15] but you know I asked Mercy I said do you
[1:00:17] believe that that if I had something
[1:00:18] then I told you I'd give it to you I
[1:00:20] would give it to you
[1:00:22] and she said yes
[1:00:24] and I had money in my pocket and mercy
[1:00:27] believed me
[1:00:29] and you know what then because she
[1:00:31] believed me
[1:00:34] and she took me out my word
[1:00:36] a mortal man
[1:00:38] but you know what she got that money
[1:00:40] that I had and that's what I was telling
[1:00:42] that little boy you know that little
[1:00:43] brother on the front row I said come up
[1:00:45] here I don't know 10 11 12 whatever he
[1:00:47] was
[1:00:47] you know but he come up there and you
[1:00:49] know and I'd asked him I said listen I
[1:00:51] said you you don't know me from Adam but
[1:00:52] do you believe me that if I had money
[1:00:54] and I would give it to you that you
[1:00:55] would take me out my word
[1:00:57] you don't know anything about me
[1:01:00] and he said yeah I would believe you
[1:01:04] I said some people probably wouldn't
[1:01:05] wouldn't trust me
[1:01:07] but he did
[1:01:09] and I said how much more
[1:01:11] would your heavenly father when he's
[1:01:13] made all of these promises to you how
[1:01:16] much more is he trying to get you to
[1:01:17] believe what he's told you
[1:01:19] right if you would walk all the way down
[1:01:22] here for a twenty dollar bill how much
[1:01:24] more would you want from the back down
[1:01:26] here for eternal life how much more
[1:01:28] would you want from the back down here
[1:01:30] to meet God for healing
[1:01:32] how much more would you walk down here
[1:01:34] for God to for deliverance
[1:01:37] but you know what if you will come down
[1:01:39] here to get a twenty dollar bill how
[1:01:41] much more would you come if God spoke to
[1:01:43] you and wanted to give you the very best
[1:01:45] if he wanted to give you the greatest
[1:01:47] desire in your heart whatever you desire
[1:01:49] he said when you desire When you pray he
[1:01:51] said if you would hunger and thirst
[1:01:52] after righteousness he said if you seek
[1:01:55] ye first the kingdom of God and he said
[1:01:58] all of these things will be added unto
[1:01:59] you if you could just go that far
[1:02:04] if you could just raise your hand in the
[1:02:07] seat that you're sitting in and claim
[1:02:08] and say that's God I claim what's mine
[1:02:11] what you've promised me I don't have to
[1:02:13] go anywhere but I can claim but why
[1:02:15] because you promised it
[1:02:17] why because brother Branham said he said
[1:02:19] if he spoke it then he said he said all
[1:02:21] of Heaven is behind it that he would
[1:02:24] bankrupt heaven to fulfill his promise
[1:02:28] and that's what he's given to you
[1:02:30] and it's the same simple Faith his same
[1:02:34] child like Faith it's all it's how you
[1:02:36] operate it
[1:02:40] if we just trust God and believe it and
[1:02:43] take him at his word
[1:02:45] you know that's the greatest thing
[1:02:48] I was thinking about
[1:02:50] you know brother brother Wade was
[1:02:51] talking about
[1:02:52] you know brother Dales preached all
[1:02:54] these years and labored in the word and
[1:02:56] and done so much and and that had the
[1:03:00] vision
[1:03:01] to put the word out to the world
[1:03:04] and it went out around the world and and
[1:03:06] you know only only
[1:03:09] eternity will tell us what what kind of
[1:03:12] uh
[1:03:14] impact this has happened around the
[1:03:16] world but you know every now and you
[1:03:17] catch people and and and just like
[1:03:19] brother uh Keith Reed was talking about
[1:03:22] brothers in Africa who've studied this
[1:03:24] message and listened to brother Dale and
[1:03:26] got the tapes and been listening and
[1:03:27] really uh laboring in the word because
[1:03:30] of the word that that has come from this
[1:03:32] church and it's not
[1:03:35] you know
[1:03:36] and it's not just brother just brother
[1:03:38] Dale
[1:03:41] you know it's one of the things that
[1:03:43] really struck me when I preached in in
[1:03:45] Ohio when I was talking about being led
[1:03:47] by the spirits you know because there
[1:03:49] was there was a her there was a thirst
[1:03:51] in somebody that was a hunger and
[1:03:52] somebody
[1:03:54] that they would desire to find something
[1:03:56] more than what they already had
[1:04:01] and they began to search for it
[1:04:05] and you know and you know there it was
[1:04:07] in the scripture when he when it when
[1:04:09] brother I'm talking about Apollos being
[1:04:12] a Baptist preacher
[1:04:14] but you know God sent somebody to show
[1:04:16] him a more perfect way the word was
[1:04:19] there but it become to be a more perfect
[1:04:20] way that uh Paul uh
[1:04:23] Aquila Priscilla come to bring him the
[1:04:26] word
[1:04:28] and it's like you know we didn't have we
[1:04:30] didn't have a Baptist preacher in our
[1:04:31] day but we had a Baptist Sunday school
[1:04:33] teacher
[1:04:34] he was a Baptist deacon
[1:04:37] but you know what there was somebody
[1:04:39] that crossed his path
[1:04:41] to show him a more perfect way and we've
[1:04:44] all been beneficiaries of that
[1:04:49] but you know what he said Paul said Paul
[1:04:52] said I planted Apollo's watered he said
[1:04:55] but God gave the increase
[1:04:57] and you know I stand here today to tell
[1:05:00] you you know what brother Branham came
[1:05:01] and planted the word but you know what
[1:05:04] pop brother Dale's the one Pop's been
[1:05:06] the one that has stood behind this
[1:05:08] pulpit and continued to water that word
[1:05:10] and let me tell you what God has brought
[1:05:11] the increase
[1:05:14] and let me tell you something we've seen
[1:05:16] the Fulfillment of the word in our day
[1:05:17] we look back and say oh what what took
[1:05:19] place back then it's a greater it's a
[1:05:21] greater thing to see what takes place in
[1:05:23] your own day what takes place in your
[1:05:24] own church what takes place in your own
[1:05:26] life
[1:05:27] why because you can argue things what
[1:05:30] took place that was planted in the Bible
[1:05:31] what took place in history and all those
[1:05:33] other things but let me tell you
[1:05:34] something they can't take away what's
[1:05:36] planted inside of you what God has
[1:05:38] planted inside of you and has quickened
[1:05:40] to life you know what you can you can
[1:05:41] argue about a lot of things but you know
[1:05:43] what you can't take away my experience
[1:05:45] you can't take away my Revelation you
[1:05:48] can't take it away
[1:05:49] why because you didn't give it to me you
[1:05:52] can't take it away the devil didn't give
[1:05:54] it to me and the devil can't take it
[1:05:55] away
[1:05:56] because it's planted why because it's an
[1:05:59] eternal seed of God that's come to life
[1:06:00] and then guess what that all the devils
[1:06:03] in hell can't take it away you're not
[1:06:04] going to be able to pluck it up why
[1:06:06] because God has planted it and it's
[1:06:08] going to come to fruition
[1:06:13] amen
[1:06:16] see I want y'all to understand
[1:06:19] why because every person if we could
[1:06:22] just see I'm speaking to young people if
[1:06:24] you can understand the desire that the
[1:06:26] people the brothers and sisters in this
[1:06:29] church have for y'all yeah
[1:06:32] you know I I think about the ones that
[1:06:35] you know that you know they they gotta
[1:06:37] take their long their own Road they were
[1:06:38] out doing whatever well you know what
[1:06:40] hey take you take your road go out
[1:06:43] you know people have asked me before and
[1:06:45] they and they talk about things that
[1:06:47] have taken place and things that have
[1:06:49] happened and I was like you know the in
[1:06:51] the scripture when the prodigal son come
[1:06:53] to his father you know his father didn't
[1:06:54] tie him up and stick him in the closet
[1:06:58] he didn't hog time
[1:07:00] you know what he said I won't watch do
[1:07:02] me and you know what he gave it to him
[1:07:05] and people's like wow that's amazing
[1:07:08] well you know what brother Brown told
[1:07:09] Rebecca when Rebecca was standing there
[1:07:12] and she was out visiting her friend out
[1:07:13] playing Boogie Woogie on the piano
[1:07:16] you know brother brother George Smith
[1:07:18] said that when when brother Brandon went
[1:07:20] next door to that girl's house and she
[1:07:22] was playing playing rock and roll on the
[1:07:24] piano you know brother random didn't
[1:07:25] bust in the door and grab her by the
[1:07:28] hair of the head and jerk her out the
[1:07:29] door and say what are you doing
[1:07:32] I said you know brother Brown didn't
[1:07:34] even say nothing to her I said Rebecca
[1:07:35] it's time to go home
[1:07:37] and he walked her out the door and they
[1:07:39] went on he didn't say that to her about
[1:07:40] it at that time
[1:07:42] but you know there was come a time when
[1:07:44] he began to speak to her about what she
[1:07:46] was doing and he said Rebecca there's
[1:07:48] the door if you want to go out you can
[1:07:51] but he said you're going to step over my
[1:07:52] prayers and your mother's prayers when
[1:07:54] you go out that door
[1:07:58] and you can and you can you can try to
[1:08:00] hog time and just like brother Ram
[1:08:01] talking about that turtle
[1:08:03] he said you know you can try to beat it
[1:08:05] out of them but beat it in them he said
[1:08:07] he don't do anything
[1:08:08] right he said you can try to drown them
[1:08:11] he said he don't do any good
[1:08:13] but he said the one thing caused that
[1:08:15] Turtle to move and he said it took the
[1:08:18] fire
[1:08:19] and let me tell you something you you
[1:08:21] can try to beat it into my out of them
[1:08:23] do whatever else but let me tell you
[1:08:25] what it takes the Holy Ghost and the
[1:08:27] Holy Ghost is the only one that's going
[1:08:29] to get them to move
[1:08:31] and if it if it's not the Holy Ghost and
[1:08:33] that's the reason sometimes you know
[1:08:34] what we try to do things in our own
[1:08:35] selves and you know I
[1:08:38] I I tell people sometimes I'm the son of
[1:08:41] Dale Roberts and you know what there's
[1:08:42] Dale Robert send me and Dale Roberts
[1:08:44] race is up sometimes you know I still
[1:08:46] see my dad I sometimes I speak and I
[1:08:48] hear my dad was like well there's Daddy
[1:08:50] why because that's who I am
[1:08:53] but you know sometimes just like you
[1:08:55] know I really appreciate my dad for one
[1:08:57] thing you know my my dad may not been
[1:09:00] the greatest man and he wasn't may not
[1:09:02] been the smartest man or anything like
[1:09:03] that but you know there's one thing that
[1:09:04] I can think about my dad that I that I
[1:09:06] wish I could be more like
[1:09:09] you know my Dad could come to me and
[1:09:11] apologize
[1:09:12] for being wrong
[1:09:15] you know some people they could they
[1:09:16] couldn't do that for no amount of money
[1:09:18] in the world
[1:09:21] but you know my Dad could do that
[1:09:23] when you're wrong you're wrong
[1:09:25] and to be able to admit that
[1:09:28] yeah and I you know I really appreciate
[1:09:30] my dad for that because you know that's
[1:09:32] that's hard for people
[1:09:34] but you know I would much I'd much
[1:09:36] rather do that
[1:09:38] than
[1:09:40] try to hold on something or try to hold
[1:09:42] something back
[1:09:43] just go ahead and hey I'm wrong and I
[1:09:45] can admit that and I just want I just
[1:09:47] want to get that clear
[1:09:52] and you know what other people
[1:09:53] appreciate it too
[1:09:58] when you're able to
[1:10:00] take it and say I'm sorry I shouldn't
[1:10:03] have done that or said whatever
[1:10:07] and you know you realize that you know
[1:10:10] there's other people watching you also
[1:10:15] so
[1:10:16] you know you don't just
[1:10:18] live you know preach an example you got
[1:10:21] to live an example you've got you've got
[1:10:23] to show people
[1:10:25] you know brother Brown said you know you
[1:10:26] can preach a sermon he said but leave me
[1:10:28] a sermon he said it was more better it
[1:10:30] was greater to live us to live the
[1:10:33] sermon
[1:10:37] so
[1:10:38] I want to try to
[1:10:41] skip some of this but you know when when
[1:10:43] you see these things when you talk start
[1:10:45] talking about
[1:10:47] um or the diet and and the things that
[1:10:49] you feed on and the the things that that
[1:10:52] consume you and everything and your
[1:10:54] brother around was talking about one of
[1:10:55] the one of the things he was preaching
[1:10:56] and messaging and spiritual Amnesia and
[1:10:58] he was talking about one of the things
[1:11:00] that you see is what causes people to
[1:11:02] have amnesia he said is the things that
[1:11:04] they feed on and he said you feed on
[1:11:06] these things and he said you don't
[1:11:07] realize who you are
[1:11:09] because of a poor diet and he said
[1:11:11] that's what caused it he said they began
[1:11:13] to eat on things that were wrong
[1:11:15] and he said it creates an allergy
[1:11:18] he said people had an allergy of a
[1:11:19] seminary diet
[1:11:21] would give you spiritual Amnesia because
[1:11:23] people that don't eat right
[1:11:26] and it's caused them
[1:11:28] and so feed on the word
[1:11:32] this is from the message what thinking
[1:11:34] of Christ brother Adam says he said he
[1:11:36] said but I I got to tell you he said
[1:11:38] it's just so real
[1:11:39] he said you see I have a food that I eat
[1:11:42] that the world knows nothing about and
[1:11:44] your spirit coming to me in faith
[1:11:46] believing what I'm telling you is the
[1:11:48] truth is the food that I live on that's
[1:11:50] my eternal life if I don't feed this
[1:11:53] natural man it'll die and if I don't
[1:11:56] feed this spiritual man it'll die
[1:11:58] he said now our brother scientist is
[1:11:59] heading here no would know that anything
[1:12:02] that doesn't eat very much and just
[1:12:04] keeps going and dieting and dieting your
[1:12:06] stomach shrinks but then if you become
[1:12:09] eating a whole lot your stomach you
[1:12:12] require more he said I sure am a glutton
[1:12:14] on this I tell you I really acquire a
[1:12:16] whole lot of it because my capacity just
[1:12:18] has no limits I often said if I could
[1:12:21] just get a little bigger maybe I could
[1:12:23] feel better
[1:12:25] and so you know that's so that's the way
[1:12:27] we ought to be is you know because many
[1:12:29] times when you eat the wrong thing
[1:12:33] when you're not eating enough then you
[1:12:35] know what then you you get weak
[1:12:37] and they said you you begin to shrink
[1:12:39] but you know what God has more for you
[1:12:41] to eat
[1:12:42] right continue to eat and feed on the
[1:12:44] word
[1:12:47] this is from the message
[1:12:49] from spiritual food in due season he
[1:12:52] said but thanks be to God we got hidden
[1:12:54] food spiritual food that we're living on
[1:12:56] the goodness and mercy of the revelation
[1:12:58] of Jesus Christ in these last days
[1:13:00] vindicating himself among his people
[1:13:02] amen they went in Elijah went in before
[1:13:05] the drought set in thank God for being
[1:13:07] in before the Judgment sets in now is a
[1:13:10] time of coming out and going in getting
[1:13:12] out of those organizations and getting
[1:13:14] into Christ coming out and going in time
[1:13:17] for all True Believers then he was
[1:13:19] called and stayed there remember he
[1:13:21] never left that Brook until God called
[1:13:23] him and after the drought was oh about
[1:13:25] over he called him out of there went to
[1:13:28] a Widow's house notice he called to this
[1:13:30] Widow and this Widow had not associated
[1:13:32] herself with unbelievers took the mark
[1:13:34] of the beast during the drought
[1:13:36] so he called her out called called
[1:13:39] Elijah to sustained this Widow just they
[1:13:42] just had one little cake one little
[1:13:44] thing that was holding she was holding
[1:13:46] on to and Elijah said give that to me
[1:13:48] first for thus saith the Lord that
[1:13:51] Barrel will not go empty neither will
[1:13:52] the crews run dry until the day that the
[1:13:55] Lord God sends rain upon the Earth God
[1:13:57] putting God first his word first
[1:14:01] now you know what what always this is
[1:14:04] I've always loved this story and there's
[1:14:05] something about this the story about
[1:14:07] Elijah and that and the widow woman you
[1:14:09] know because in the in the time of
[1:14:11] drought when God when God told Elijah to
[1:14:14] tell him he said he said there won't be
[1:14:16] any rain till I call for it and because
[1:14:18] because of the sin and the problems in
[1:14:21] Israel and Judah they they were under
[1:14:23] the under the condemnation of God they
[1:14:25] were under the Judgment of God and
[1:14:27] Elijah God calls Elijah to go and sit by
[1:14:30] the Brook cherith and he sat beside the
[1:14:33] brook of the chair and the Ravens come
[1:14:35] and fed him and he drank by the Brook
[1:14:38] now the rest until the rest of the
[1:14:40] country is under judgment and they're
[1:14:42] all freaking out and they're all
[1:14:43] wondering what's going to take place
[1:14:45] because there's no rain and they can see
[1:14:47] everything becoming to dwindling and
[1:14:49] going away but you know what God had
[1:14:51] called Elijah
[1:14:53] to this place to set beside this Brook
[1:14:57] and something Supernatural taking place
[1:14:59] now nobody else saw that but it was
[1:15:01] something that spoke to Elijah it was
[1:15:04] God dealing with Elijah ministering to
[1:15:06] Elijah now this whole time that God is
[1:15:08] dealing with Elijah and ministering to
[1:15:10] him in the Brook cherith at this place
[1:15:12] you know there was a little widow woman
[1:15:14] down there and every single day she kept
[1:15:17] noticing that everything was going away
[1:15:18] everything was drying up everything is
[1:15:21] going away and all of a sudden you know
[1:15:23] she's getting to the place where there's
[1:15:24] nothing and she can see that her son is
[1:15:27] just starting to to dwindle away and and
[1:15:29] then you know she could really see in
[1:15:32] her mind she really began to see death
[1:15:34] all around them they because she told
[1:15:37] Elijah you know listen we're just gonna
[1:15:38] eat this little bit and then we're going
[1:15:39] to die
[1:15:41] in this whole time here's Elijah up
[1:15:44] there and he's in this place and he's
[1:15:46] being ministered to and he's getting and
[1:15:49] he's getting this food this Supernatural
[1:15:52] message is coming to him and he's eating
[1:15:54] and he's feasting on this all by himself
[1:15:57] he separated away and here he is he's
[1:15:59] eating and he's enjoying himself and
[1:16:01] then when he walks out to when this
[1:16:02] Brook dries up and one of the things
[1:16:05] people people ask me you know why things
[1:16:07] happen the way that they do and and when
[1:16:09] I got no explanation for it and I tell
[1:16:12] people I say well sometimes when you
[1:16:14] don't understand why things are going on
[1:16:15] and it's and you think well you know
[1:16:18] because so much is going on but it's
[1:16:19] like God has you in a certain place and
[1:16:21] you're like well I don't understand
[1:16:22] what's going on it's like well maybe
[1:16:24] God's got you at the brook cherith
[1:16:27] foreign
[1:16:27] maybe this is the brook cherith for you
[1:16:29] and the God's speaking to you maybe
[1:16:31] God's speaking you do maybe the Lord's
[1:16:32] dealing with you
[1:16:35] and it's like well you know what you
[1:16:36] just stay right there because if that's
[1:16:38] what God God's got you doing that then
[1:16:40] you stay right there because when the
[1:16:42] water dries up God will have you a place
[1:16:44] to go
[1:16:47] and so you know there's times that you
[1:16:48] know I just tell people hey I'm at the
[1:16:49] brook Sheriff
[1:16:51] sometimes you don't understand why
[1:16:52] you're while you're in the Situation's
[1:16:54] yard but you know what it it may look
[1:16:56] bad around you but it's like well I
[1:16:57] think I'm not doing too bad yeah
[1:17:00] but you know
[1:17:02] here here's Elijah being a minister to
[1:17:05] and all this is going on but this woman
[1:17:07] she's in this she's in this place where
[1:17:09] she's about to die
[1:17:11] she doesn't see anything that's that's
[1:17:13] any good around her
[1:17:15] her situation keeps getting worse and
[1:17:17] worse and worse
[1:17:20] but you know what then when the when the
[1:17:21] brook dried up then Elijah come and the
[1:17:24] Lord had sent her to the to her
[1:17:28] I knew exactly where she was at and he
[1:17:30] waited till she got to that place
[1:17:33] for Elijah to come to speak to her and
[1:17:35] speak into her situation and he's like
[1:17:38] well why don't you just give me a little
[1:17:39] bit first
[1:17:41] and out of your need out of your lack
[1:17:43] out of your want give me just a little
[1:17:46] bit
[1:17:47] because you know what I've got a word
[1:17:48] for you
[1:17:50] and one of the things one of the things
[1:17:52] about this this story that always it
[1:17:54] always just it it Thrills me it stirs me
[1:17:57] up because lots of times I've seen
[1:17:59] people come and it's like well I don't
[1:18:01] know why I'm here and you know all these
[1:18:03] all these situations happen in life and
[1:18:05] everything like that and I was like you
[1:18:07] know what sometimes we don't realize
[1:18:08] because brother Rob said if you had a
[1:18:10] question or or a need he said he said he
[1:18:14] would be you had something that you're
[1:18:15] dealing with he said he's obligated to
[1:18:17] put a man behind the pulpit to answer
[1:18:19] your question
[1:18:21] and so I you know I was like you know
[1:18:23] that's the way this way the ministry is
[1:18:25] sometimes sometimes the problem is is
[1:18:27] you know what we're just by the Brook
[1:18:29] cherith and you know what God's dealing
[1:18:31] with us because we he's feeding us he's
[1:18:33] given us we're we're so you know
[1:18:35] sometimes like like brother wait to talk
[1:18:37] about you know sometimes you know we
[1:18:39] don't get to do things and we don't go
[1:18:40] places why because we're studying
[1:18:42] you know because we've got other things
[1:18:44] that we have to do because we're before
[1:18:46] God and we're trying to get the mind of
[1:18:49] God and you know and here he was you
[1:18:51] know so that's the same way you come to
[1:18:53] church and say well I'm looking for this
[1:18:55] or I need something and I you know what
[1:18:57] but you know what sometimes we don't
[1:18:59] come to church and realize that the
[1:19:01] preacher the pastor has been has been in
[1:19:04] the presence of God and you know what
[1:19:06] sometimes there's a supernatural
[1:19:08] happening taking place but the problem
[1:19:10] is is you're looking about your
[1:19:12] situation all around you and you see
[1:19:14] everything and not realizing that the
[1:19:16] supernatural has taken place and because
[1:19:18] if if the Lord give us these words to
[1:19:21] speak then you know what it's not my
[1:19:22] it's not my mind it's not my words but
[1:19:25] it's his words well then if he's the one
[1:19:27] that come to speak this then you have
[1:19:29] that neighbor then you come well then
[1:19:30] guess what he come to speak life into
[1:19:33] your situation he come to speak blessing
[1:19:35] into your situation but the problem is
[1:19:37] is we're still looking at our
[1:19:39] surroundings are not realizing God Has
[1:19:40] Come
[1:19:42] the word has come to speak to you
[1:19:46] and maybe maybe tonight you you get
[1:19:48] ready to go to Camp maybe tonight you're
[1:19:50] looking at things in today but just
[1:19:52] realize God is here to speak to you he's
[1:19:55] speaking to you tonight that he's
[1:19:56] wanting you to understand that I'm here
[1:19:59] and he's speaking you to give you an
[1:20:01] answer and you and you go to camp and
[1:20:03] you know those Brothers brother John
[1:20:06] brother Josh you know no doubt no doubt
[1:20:08] they've been seeking the mind of God to
[1:20:10] find out what he has because he's going
[1:20:12] to speak to your life he's going to
[1:20:13] speak something into you
[1:20:15] and it's not just well we're just coming
[1:20:19] to hear a good sermon
[1:20:21] no he's going to speak to you personally
[1:20:27] how many times have you went to church
[1:20:28] and
[1:20:30] the Lord just speaks something
[1:20:33] I went
[1:20:34] many many years ago
[1:20:36] I preached it brother preached for
[1:20:38] brother Lee Garland years ago on on a
[1:20:40] Thursday night
[1:20:42] and
[1:20:44] just decided to go
[1:20:47] didn't didn't have any you know just
[1:20:49] just something light on my heart it's
[1:20:52] like well I'm going just follow the
[1:20:54] leading of the Lord just went I had a
[1:20:56] little thought it's like well brother
[1:20:58] Lee calls on me to preach I'll preach if
[1:21:00] not I'll just go and fellowship and I
[1:21:02] got there
[1:21:03] brother Lee asked me to preach so I just
[1:21:06] got up and I just preached a little
[1:21:08] thought that I had
[1:21:09] and
[1:21:10] after church there was a brother came up
[1:21:12] to me and he said brother he said the
[1:21:14] next time you're at the house he said
[1:21:15] come knock on the door
[1:21:18] and I was like what
[1:21:21] he said what you preached on tonight he
[1:21:23] said answer the questions we're sitting
[1:21:24] at the house at the table talking he
[1:21:26] said what you preached on is exactly
[1:21:28] what he's talking about today
[1:21:31] he said how'd you know that I said
[1:21:32] because that was God
[1:21:36] and he said you answered my question
[1:21:41] and just just following that little
[1:21:42] nudge
[1:21:44] just take that little thought
[1:21:48] you know
[1:21:50] maybe that won't happen one time in your
[1:21:51] life but you know what
[1:21:53] that speaks volumes
[1:21:57] so it it may not be a whole lot that's
[1:21:59] all right
[1:22:01] you know you may not be well known but
[1:22:03] you know what I just want to be found
[1:22:04] faithful
[1:22:06] to speak what God has for us
[1:22:11] now
[1:22:13] so I just want to share a few other
[1:22:14] things and then we'll then we'll get
[1:22:16] ready to close but you know
[1:22:18] speaking here
[1:22:21] brother but I'm speaking he tells the
[1:22:23] vision
[1:22:24] and it's this is from the message Christ
[1:22:26] the mystery and you know he's began talk
[1:22:28] in 1962 when they had the tax case and
[1:22:31] everything was going on you know he
[1:22:33] began to
[1:22:34] look about going overseas and going
[1:22:37] different places and he was there with
[1:22:38] brother uh I think brother Banks brother
[1:22:40] sulfman them and and you know he was
[1:22:42] going and he saw that little white boat
[1:22:44] and all that and he was like oh I'm not
[1:22:46] going
[1:22:47] because it just wasn't right but he said
[1:22:50] the angel of the Lord began to speak to
[1:22:51] him he said store up the food
[1:22:53] he said store up the food
[1:22:56] and he said you know he said I had the
[1:22:57] vision he said I was carrying all those
[1:22:59] great big vegetables in Rolling them in
[1:23:01] the church you know storing them up
[1:23:04] and he said I kept storing them and then
[1:23:05] you know then he was he was praying
[1:23:07] there and and the message Christ the
[1:23:09] mystery and he said Lord he said I've
[1:23:10] been Faith you know Faithfully doing
[1:23:12] this when you give me the vision to
[1:23:14] store up the food and there he was
[1:23:16] storing up the food
[1:23:18] and I want you to understand something
[1:23:20] because you know if if you have a desire
[1:23:22] if you have an appetite for the word let
[1:23:24] me tell you something the word's been
[1:23:26] stored up
[1:23:28] it's been it's been stored up
[1:23:31] and so this is what God's done for you
[1:23:35] it's not for anybody else it's
[1:23:36] personally to you God stored up this
[1:23:38] food for you
[1:23:40] and so when we look at you know all 1100
[1:23:43] sermons
[1:23:45] also all those were from us
[1:23:47] and it's a personal it's a personal
[1:23:49] thing to you it's it's mine
[1:23:53] God said God sent Elijah the prophet to
[1:23:55] me he said behold I send you Elijah the
[1:23:57] prophet I told I told him when I was
[1:23:59] down brother ismail's church I told him
[1:24:01] I said that's personal to me about the
[1:24:03] rest of you but I know Elijah come to me
[1:24:05] he was sent for me I don't know about
[1:24:06] the rest of you
[1:24:09] that's what and that's what I was
[1:24:10] telling them in India so you know it was
[1:24:12] Elijah the prophet for my that's me
[1:24:14] Malachi 4 is mine
[1:24:17] that was that was personal to me I don't
[1:24:18] know about the rest of you but
[1:24:21] this is from the message speak to the
[1:24:24] mountain brother Brown says the word of
[1:24:25] God Is So infallible he said that not
[1:24:28] one jot or tittle can ever fail
[1:24:31] and just on that much scripture we could
[1:24:35] base an eternity knowing that it would
[1:24:38] never fail
[1:24:40] and because it is part of God God is in
[1:24:42] his word and he said now we are now
[1:24:46] notice that how it that it always
[1:24:49] happens no matter how strange it may
[1:24:51] seem but in God's Own good time he makes
[1:24:54] every word testify Jesus said when he
[1:24:58] was here on Earth the scriptures cannot
[1:25:00] broke be broken he said you destroy the
[1:25:02] body he said I'll raise it up in three
[1:25:03] days because it was based on scripture
[1:25:07] and then drop down
[1:25:10] and and so he begins to
[1:25:13] speak about David the prophet and
[1:25:16] because Jesus understood that what David
[1:25:18] had said in the scripture was what he
[1:25:20] was standing on and he said you he said
[1:25:22] you say if I knew there was a scripture
[1:25:24] that pertained to me like that I believe
[1:25:27] I could have the same faith
[1:25:29] well my beloved friends every Divine
[1:25:32] promise in the Bible belongs to you and
[1:25:35] it's just as essential to you as it was
[1:25:38] to him
[1:25:39] you find One Promise here that God has
[1:25:42] made and all the heavens and earth will
[1:25:44] pass away before that promise would ever
[1:25:46] fail to act in your stead because it's
[1:25:49] to the believer whosoever may come and
[1:25:52] be partakers of these blessings
[1:25:55] he said and and so he said we miss the
[1:25:58] blessings he said Faith cometh he said
[1:26:00] and the reason we miss it is because we
[1:26:02] don't feed on it enough Jesus said man
[1:26:04] shall not live by bread alone but by
[1:26:05] every word that proceedeth out of the
[1:26:07] mouth of God man shall have his Daily
[1:26:09] Bread by the word of God but we try to
[1:26:12] make it more and less more or less off
[1:26:15] some far-off promise way away in some
[1:26:18] other age but the Bible says now we are
[1:26:21] the sons of God not we will be but we
[1:26:23] are now
[1:26:25] now let's this he said and God has not
[1:26:27] made it complicated
[1:26:30] and many people try
[1:26:33] to think it's that way that it's
[1:26:35] complicated therefore they miss the real
[1:26:37] blessing of the word by trying to make
[1:26:40] it some hard thing and my purpose in
[1:26:42] these next 10 or 15 minutes is to reveal
[1:26:44] to you the best that I that I can by his
[1:26:47] blessed word that God is not complicated
[1:26:49] in any way the believer makes it
[1:26:52] complicated God makes it simple so when
[1:26:55] you when you say that I I wanted to read
[1:26:58] that because of what because I I want
[1:27:00] you to see that it pertains to you you
[1:27:01] said oh like you said oh if I could just
[1:27:04] find this one part that belongs to me
[1:27:05] all of it pertains to you
[1:27:08] amen and you may and he said it's so
[1:27:10] simple God's made it so simple
[1:27:15] well we make it complicated
[1:27:21] and this is from the from the from the
[1:27:24] message the power of decision and
[1:27:26] brother I'm speaking of the Manna and he
[1:27:28] said and he said they went
[1:27:29] and got some of this manna
[1:27:31] he said you know David must have tasted
[1:27:33] a little that did you ever taste any of
[1:27:36] this sweet manna
[1:27:37] he said I've seen people get so much of
[1:27:39] it till they just lick their lips I have
[1:27:42] just a real gastronomical Jubilee
[1:27:44] spiritual spiritually speaking oh my it
[1:27:47] feels you out you know when you get real
[1:27:49] weak and eat a great big Square meal how
[1:27:51] you feel
[1:27:54] and he says you know a fella went to the
[1:27:56] doctor he says Doctor I'm sick he said
[1:27:59] what's the matter
[1:28:00] he said you know being gonna ask him a
[1:28:02] little uh him a little physical things
[1:28:05] he said yes well that's all right he
[1:28:07] said when did you eat last I ate a half
[1:28:09] a cracker before yet day before
[1:28:11] yesterday
[1:28:12] he said brother you're just hungry
[1:28:15] and he said that's what's wrong with the
[1:28:17] church what's the matter with the church
[1:28:18] today it's anemia because they're not
[1:28:20] getting enough spiritual food if they
[1:28:22] got the Bible brother it would just put
[1:28:24] the blood of Christ in the veins of the
[1:28:26] believer new life life comes from the
[1:28:28] blood amen the anemia condition of the
[1:28:31] church pitiful pale cheek Mama we need a
[1:28:33] transfusion to start us off
[1:28:37] that's right
[1:28:40] they began to speak about David and he's
[1:28:42] talking about David said my cup runneth
[1:28:44] over and he says you know he was a sheep
[1:28:46] herder and he used to carry a little
[1:28:47] script bag along with him there at his
[1:28:49] side and head he packed some honey in
[1:28:51] the and the Sheep would get sick and he
[1:28:54] put the honey on the Rock because they
[1:28:55] wanted the Sheep not so much to lick the
[1:28:58] honey
[1:28:59] but it likes things sweet so they wanted
[1:29:01] to get the lime off the rock because the
[1:29:03] lime had a healing element in it so
[1:29:06] they'd pour the honey on the Rock in the
[1:29:08] sick sick sheep would go to licking that
[1:29:10] honey and licking the honey while they
[1:29:11] got the rock and it always cures the
[1:29:14] sick sheep well brother we got a whole
[1:29:16] script bag full of it here tonight of
[1:29:18] Honey amen and we put it on Christ Jesus
[1:29:21] not some denomination we put it on
[1:29:23] Christ Jesus where it belongs and you
[1:29:25] you six sheep go to licking right here
[1:29:27] right quick Now find out if you don't
[1:29:30] get well it tastes like honey in the
[1:29:32] Rocky man you open up your heart and get
[1:29:34] to rejoice and before God you'll get a
[1:29:36] little Limestone once in a while a
[1:29:38] little Stone of what off the Rock of
[1:29:40] Ages hallelujah oh how I love it you say
[1:29:43] Rock of Ages yes sir will I walk brother
[1:29:45] Benham like them people yes sir walk in
[1:29:47] the light he will pack you around you
[1:29:50] know God said the Bible he packed them
[1:29:51] away On Eagle's Wings the Bible said
[1:29:54] well then Israel must have been sitting
[1:29:56] On Eagle's Wings Crossing no wonder they
[1:29:58] didn't walk in anymore but did you ever
[1:30:00] get on Eagles wings and walk
[1:30:03] because God made a promise to them so
[1:30:05] that you know what they didn't have to
[1:30:06] walk in mud because they were walking on
[1:30:08] what God provided for them and so God
[1:30:10] had made a way and you know what it's
[1:30:11] the same thing with you and I he's made
