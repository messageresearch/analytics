========================================

all right we're on Romans 15 we've got one more chapter and then I've been asked by two people to do straight from the spirits oh no I said I'll have two people say that so I've had nobody else saying anything else he said he brings and something something for my to people want me to do I want us to do the spirit of self but you know y'all decide we got you this brings out yeah is in labor yep you're right it's in there somewhere if we ever get to it we got this one one more chapter and then we're done so it's only gonna be a couple more weeks and then we'll decide so they don't want to get I don't wanna get too in-depth because let's see what we got we've got three more Sundays and I'll be going to the Philippines to seven through the nineteen so the tenth and the seventeen picture knit you did the lecture you did the last one Louise Louise sorry so the tenth when you go and then everything oh nothing pants down second time go member then right and the seventeen will get somebody out so many good alright anyway we're good now we then that are strong I'll compare the infirmities of the weak and not to please ourselves in other words what does that mean let's don't please people just to take advantage up yeah okay be careful don't come we'll try to take advantage of the weak just bear with them let everyone of us please his neighbor for it's good to edification or in a much more being built up you don't do that now yes for even Christ please the whole self but as it has written the reproaches of them that reproached thee fell on me in other words Christ didn't come for itself none at all he did not come to this earth for his self you have to eat you have to be good when he hit this earth it was for one purpose and that was to get a people to save a group of people that was on the earth and and then take them back into the into the eternity three came from so Christ damn pleases they let me he didn't know where did he he took plays or nothing and we read that in the Old Testament where that everything was on him I mean the whole reproach of the world was on top of this man named Jesus for whatsoever things are written were written aforetime or before were written for our learning in other words the Old Testament were written for our learning that we through patience income another scripture might have hope now remember Paul wants to saw a revelation here because remember the New Testament hadn't been written when Paul's writing this to the Roman if there's nothing called a New Testament a book Macky Martley got another no now they may have been written but what I'm saying is Paul didn't have his hands on it once he talking about then he said we should get them from the Old Testament right where we read of wars and eye-for-an-eye and you know kill this one and you know take this one out and you know but you guys see the love of God in there somewhere because that's what he says we're ready for time we're written for our learning that we through patience and comfort of the Scriptures might have hope now we say that with the old end of New Testament so we have hope with both the old and the New Testament so now the god of patience and thank God he's got pictures and consolation ones consolation comforting grant you to be like-minded one toward another according to Christ Jesus Louie did you do the last sentence go I'll look back and save us and what do you own you word Bob one day okay okay Pollock owning this thing well Broncos gonna do the 10th of March so well Joe's gonna do the 10th of March so you're gonna do the 17th while I'm going the Philippines March 17th okay if you can't find something yeah it's all of you brother now the patience and consolation grant you to be like-minded one toward another according to Christ Jesus that you may with one mind and one mouth glorify God even the father of our Lord Jesus Christ one mine one mile there's only one word we must have singleness of heart I was thinking yesterday you even even in the greatest message that ever was given even when the Lord Jesus from giving in itself of course you can't really put them two together because they didn't have the Holy Ghost but now we're supposed to have the Holy Ghost in the end time and we're supposed to have all things together and and right and you know all things going in the right direction and you see it you're scared like shotgun blasts we're honest though there's something going on here and I know what it is those two spirits it's working in the framework of the church messy church not just Church out junga it's not that the Antichrist is not out there Antichrist is right here bro come he's close to the word right wherefore received you one another as Christ also received us to the glory of God now I say that Jesus Christ was a minister of the circumcision for the truth of God to confirm the promise made into the father's now remember we went through all that learning about circumcision and non circumcision remember Jesus came to the Jews first which was of the circumcision right but now you got to remember it wasn't the circumcision of the foreskin of the of the male anymore it's the foreskin of your heart so we all have circumcision of the heart because it's from the truth of God you'd be circumcised all your life and don't go to hell millions in billions well but so that has nothing to do with it right but when Christ came he ministered to the circumcision he went to the people of youth for the truth of God to confirm the promise made unto the father's but what did they do with turned him down they turn Christ down I mean they even look the ones he came to the ones that circumcision that the Bible spoke of and that the Gentiles might glorify God for it's mercy what the uncircumcised as it is written for this cause I will confess to the among the Gentiles and sing unto thy name they'll remember Paul's talking to the Romans so he's going to the Gentiles telling the Gentiles that Christ came to die for them - he didn't just come to die for the Jews he came to town for everybody yes all right and again he says rejoice ye Gentiles with his people do you think Jin tiles together rejoice together with each other because remember Paul comes up just in the natural story Paul comes up and he's trying to convert the Jews and they saw word already of circumcision and then he goes and says well we're going to convert the Gentiles now were there not a certainty you know he-man was a it only took a master Paul prophet a property called Paul that could stand with the Jews and say yes I know cuz I'm a circumcision I've come under that I've lived that all my life but now God has turned to the Jews coming to the Gentiles and he wants us to be together but then they just keep doing the separate come I get the message you don't you bringing together in separate and again he said where George can talk with his people and again praise the Lord all you Gentiles and laud him all you people and again I was asked that that she'll be a root of Jesse and he that shall rise to reign over the Gentiles and him shall the Gentiles trust because remember we're Nations there's only a little bitty group right now that called jente I mean it's called Jews that are real Jews and they're over in Israel little bitty of microcosm compared to the billions of others the billions of the other Gentiles all right excuse me and the Gentile bride is going to totally outnumber totally outnumbered the yellow : yes totally outnumbered the the Jews totally so that's what he said look he said again I'm destined there should be a ruby I see and he that shall rise to reign over the Gentiles and him shall the Gentiles trust now the god of Hope fill you with all joy and peace and believing that you may abound in hope to the power of the Holy Ghost and I myself also am persuaded of you my brethren none who didn't present confident then he also are full of goodness filled with all knowledge able also to admonish one another and that's what we do is we go up the stack of a perfect man you learned these things you are what we're learning we're learning how to let God control we're learning how to let go it's not common it's not common to let the Lord lead us hello somebody done right it's not you're a born contrary to God your morning on the other side yes we've got to learn and bring this whole nature it's like this Oh nature's gonna die become a new nature but you still got that little bit inside that you're gonna work on they're still trying to pull you in this direction right all right and that's our problem when we get this thing all upright then we're going around we'll take a body shame and then going around nevertheless brethren I have written the more boldly unto you in some sort as putting you in mind because of the grace that is given to me Oh God now what's he saying nevertheless I have written more boldly unto you in some sort as putting you in mind because of the grace that is given to me of God that I should be the minister of Jesus Christ to the Gentiles ministering the gospel of God is telling the Romans that they said you're getting a message I'm bringing you a message boldly bringing your message I'm the one that's delivering it that the offering up of the Gentiles might be acceptable being sanctified by the Holy Ghost see he's still dealing with those oh jesus is they're dogs they're dirty they're thing Gentiles are just filthy people but Paul sands look sanctified by the Holy Ghost it's like when Peter had that vision of those dirty animals coming down and he said never even you them and the Holy Ghost is like huh you gonna eat that you're going to the Gentiles you're gonna eat that I've never laid down you know what Peter says I don't that was a Gentile die out there but you don't you know that I don't ever do that God said now we're gonna save to file that yes and you're gonna be able to eat it so he's gonna be able to partake and then take it to the to the to the Gentile we just don't comprehend sometimes you said think about it we don't comprehend there was a total division between the Jews and the Gentiles because the Jews were God's chosen nation leave us alone your own uncircumcision you're dying and going to hell every one of you right the whole world and they still think that but think about it back then you know where you come up to a place to where we're God's people we have the Old Testament our Messiah's coming to us he ain't coming to y'all right I am a massage coming to us he's not a truck he's not even promised to come to you and he wasn't even promised to come to his own people and we'll get into that this afternoon back to that fifth seal where God blinded the the Jews he literally had to put them in blindness so that you and I could come in he had that's why he had to give that 50 of you eternal life that's why he asked through two prophets preached to open the eyes of 144,000 because if they like been for that they went to bed no day and 70 weeks with a gap in the middle it would have been totally the Jews all the way through God would have took him in Iraq took them in a a rapture and they have been living in the kingdom so that Paul's trying to break that wall down between the Jews and and the Gentiles and it probably was hard for him he was born a Jew I'm the chosen of God you know I've chosen of God but when he got struck down and he said I'm Jesus who you persecuted he knew he was persecuting Jesus through them people yeah so he knew where Christ was at least he knew at that moment where Christ was and I'm sure he had a he had some suede palm moments wondering what God's gonna do kill him but what did God do got turned that thing around opened his eyes to the Gentile shinning to the Gentile made him a prophet and wrote eighty percent of New Testament through that man so hallelujah was that wrote eighty percent of the New Testament through the guy that was going to kill the most of the New Testament because he attacked whatwhat's the people you know at that time then you testimony he was he hated that new testimony he didn't hear them talk about Jesus and he'd wanted just to cut the throat look what he's doing them that I should be the minister of Jesus Christ to the ministering the gospel of God that the offering up of the Gentiles might be acceptable you still gotta preach it they gotta accept them being sanctified by the Holy Ghost I have therefore where of I have therefore aware of I made glory through Jesus Christ and those things which pertain to God for I will not dare to speak of any of those things which Christ hath not wrought by me to make the Gentiles obedient by word indeed my love what he said I will not dare speak anything because you know for a fact remember him and Peter had a problem not with doctrine they had a problem with the way Peter was treating some of the Gentiles and the way Peter was doing some things all right so what's he saying here I will not dare to speak to many of those things which Christ Christ has not wrought by me in other words to make the Gentiles obedient some over here in the Jews are going well let's just be a a little while and you know you gotta sell on Sam and let's go circumcise them all see how they walk they and you know and they're you know being older but no policy no I'm not gonna do anything that God didn't tell me to do to the Gentiles we're not going to dispute over what this one says and that will say you got to go by the Word of God to make the Gentiles obedient but-but-but what I always think about is here's the Gentiles over here gladly receiving the message gladly receiving Paul and Peter calling they met you never saw anywhere oh you had you little ones like Simon the sorcerer and some of them but they wanted what they had but you don't see the Old Testament I mean the the Gentiles trying to beat up on a Tuesday it was always the Jews was the one that was cutting off the Gentiles and sending them out they were dogs and they were all that so but you know what's the difference is they were sanctified by the Holy Ghost all right they were sanctified by the Holy Ghost the Gentiles work and so we're some of the Jews what there was only a small amount command can you imagine from the time of the day of Pentecost that's what pit Paul's dealing with here at you know after the day of Pentecost man they just went out into the world spreading the gospel at all even the disciples went into all different different parts of the world for I will not dare to speak of any of those names witchcraft that's not wrong by me to make the Gentiles obedient by word and deed in other words we're not gonna beat them to death we're gonna preach the word what they go through mighty signs and wonders by the power of the Spirit of God that's the only way to win somebody all right so that from Jerusalem and round about it until alike room I have fully preached the gospel of Christ yay so I have strived to preach the gospel not where Christ was named less I should build up another man's foundation know where he's preaching Christ him preaching somebody else he's preaching Christ that's thing we were you enough was that but as it is written to them he has not spoken of they shall see and they too have not heard shall understand all right so we were not spoken of Gentiles most of them didn't see Christ know you and I had seen Christ right but we've seen through signs and wonderful by the preaching of the word of God and all the different things that Christ did die for us they shall see and they that have not heard shall understand they didn't hear about Jesus until after he left their into their hearing about Christ through somebody and that's the way it's supposed to be the seed comes to the life comes through the body I was thinking yesterday about some things maybe for later home but you know Christ ahead is great greatest of all but you know a brain without a body is useless totally useless doesn't matter how many receptors that brain sends down into that body if there's nothing but a hair set on the table there's no hand to move yeah even though the brain says hand moved if there's no handling if there's nobody there no foot you wouldn't say it's useless but it would be useless in in forwarding something it would be used within doing something that's why Christ is ahead and he had to have a body and have a body called a bride cuz this is where the receptors when his brain fires and tells the hand to move then the hand move or defeat moves or whatever we want to do if I understand that that's how important you are because Christ look tell me what Christ did on the earth when he was here how many people did he say zero yeah he had no body on the earth he saved no one while he was here right all right oh yeah I go and send the war into all these things sure he did there was no one that he birthed while he was here right zero because really I want to be real clear with this his body is his bride and that alone the 144,000 the Jews the people the foolish virgin the ones here to give me eternal life that's not his body his body is only connected to the head his body is his bride and that's the born-again believers with eternal life in their soul there was only on the day of Pentecost 120 of his body began to be built on the day of Pentecost so that's how important you are to hear the bride and all down through the ages he had to have a body to work through yes you know what he can decide that because he's God that's what he said so we just got to believe when he said like Paul preach the gospel the gospel tells us he God needs the body he told us he needed a body the hand without the foot it's nothing this without that's nothing well but - now remember your body without a head totally useless right it's actually dead okay because really I mean you can live if you stay with your spine you can live if you if your brain can get the functions to your organs but you just can't move anything well that's what happened I believe that's what happened what savings done he's paralyzed the body he's paralyzed a lot of the body we need to lift the head and the hand work together brother bear said one time you don't think feet moving your hand move now as we get older that might be that may be true feet moving did something else happen don't we got another day and he said he's an older gentleman he said I can't get my favorite move when I wanna do some I say so myself but that's just - spot looking at a falling body but let's look at the body a crash which is never cloud the way it works way it's supposed to work all right but as it is ready to whom he was not spoken though they shall see and they too have not heard shall understand for which cause also I have been hindered from the coming from coming to you why it was hindered because the people said I you don't need to go to them you don't think my they were Romans they were boy are you talking about see here's the situation this is my father Paul's Jew he even being a Jew was under Roman rule since he was a baby all the way up this adulthood Rome had ruled Jerusalem and now he's fixin to go to the people they told them what to do for all they knew that ruled over him so it's a it's a paradox that Paul was going to the Romans that that literally killed the Jews I mean really wrong so I put Christ on the cross it wasn't no it was a no it was a Roman way of torture not a Jewish leg torture okay but now we know the Jews drew the Jews excuse me put them on the cross but we called all that I have been hindered from coming to you but now having no moral place in these parts and having the great desire these many years become of you he's getting ready so you don't have one more chapter so he's getting ready to tell him he's done in these parts he's sitting in Jerusalem writing this letter in other words my ministry here is not doing very good I'm supposed to go to Gentile there with many Gentiles in Jerusalem you've got to go gotta go out alright but now having normal place in these parts and having a great desire these many years to come unto you excuse me once so ever I take my journey into Spain I will come to you for I trust to see you in my journey and you've brought on my way then the work by you if first I be somewhat filled with your company though which he's going to visit he's just part of the letter he's right go but now I going to Jerusalem commencement to the Saints he's strengthened into present cover for it hath pleased them of Macedonia and occasion now that's out it's not in Jerusalem there they're a little bit further to make a certain contribution for the poor saints which are at Jerusalem because remember they're still getting persecuted week we forget that when we and I was thinking the same thing pretty much that when Paul was the biggest persecutor of the Jews right well when Paul gets converted moves away it settles down know they just somebody else took Paul's placement and started persecuting cuz remember all eleven of the twelve disciples were all killed Peter was nothing upside down one of them was pulled apart one was killed when I was killed by sword when I'm his head James his head was cut off John the back door the Revelator the only one that lived - for natural death yes saying it's horrible what happened to him but it was because they took the gospel so they were still persecution in Jerusalem for saints which are in Jerusalem I don't mean I don't know that that's poor and money-wise but maybe they were pouring doctrine it has please them fairly and their debtors they are for if the Gentiles have been made partakers of their spiritual thing their duty is also to minister unto them and carnal things alright take care of them in the carnal things or the change of nature and natural things material thing so I guess they are talking about the poor saints which they are poor take care of them and carnal things and in spiritual thing when therefore Clark's gone we probably tell the clock hey what time with you I'm JT yeah Tim okay thank you ma'am we have uh we have a b-flat with the first lesson than B even yesterday for about six or seven hours when we get several speakers and then there was a guy that would hold up you've got 15 minutes but man then people would go on I mean be for the camera and so you aim it so you have to hold up with time sheets since you got 15 minutes man you got man you got a five minute then one says shut up so we had literally take the Shepherd hook and drag them off the stage humans prefer filled with that hello when therefore I have performed this and have sealed sealed to them this fruit I will come by you into Spain what you talking about he's strengthening the people then he's going to Rome he's gonna strengthen sealed to them this fruit not apples and oranges okay and I ensure that when I come unto you I shall come in the fullness of the blessings of the gospel of Christ that's what brother brought him waiter don't remember he'd take them every day used to do he said he'd lay out all the requests and he'd pray old and then he would feel which one the Lord would lead him to go to and that's the same way with Paul you know the Bible said the footsteps of the righteous to order the Lord so we don't do things sometimes we think we do things forever listen we don't get any we don't get any benefit or anything out of it but you never know you'll know at the end you'll know when you get over there somebody way back in the back you could get a bless their soul and you know what that's worth the whole trip now the CT brethren for the Lord Jesus Christ thank them for the love of the Spirit that you strive together with me in your prayers to God for making them pray for me alright then I may be delivered from them that do not believe in you then they do not believe don't believe in Judea but don't believe that are in Judea right and that my service in Judea that's Jerusalem there's none believers did you have yes they are and that my service which I have for Jerusalem may be accepted of the Saints that I may come unto you with joy by the will of God and may with you be refreshed now the God of peace be with you all amen then he this is a continuation of this letter I'm commanding to use BB our sister which is a servant of the church which is that since shrimp that you receive her in the lord as becoming Saints and your sister and whatsoever business she has need of you where she has been a supporter of many and I myself also know you know what that word means it should provider alright helper holding out problem with a woman helping out right okay she just knew her place okay in your place grief or Silvana Killa which was the two tentmakers Priscilla in the killer my helpers in Christ Jesus who have for my life laid down their own necks if you'll remember back then some of the other Gospels there was a disputation one day about Paul and I think they were getting ready to stone him and I think Priscilla and the killer stepped up because they were businessmen women Tim makers and even employed Paul so they were friends and business partners not maybe business partners of Paul work form alright and then they they got him out of trouble so there's the Lord has people sitting in you know think about this all the people in your life that that God's put in your direction that has helped you and guided you may not only be a Christian might only be a Christian I've had a lot of people help me in things that we're not Christian they just had good what good humanly you know like Jim's dad he's just good business head good businessman and it's good to listen to them but no you be careful I told me one time I said gene I listened to Union matters of the of the business but in matters of the church you don't need to interpret because you ain't even read that Bible before though so you don't have to lay it straight you know you take the posture where you take advice in that same way with the killer of Brazil they help Bob who have for my life weighed down their own necks and over that time when they walked out there they would get a stone a killing Priscilla they were business people they put their life and you know how business is if you you wrong a bunch of people on them you're basically now with social media like it is the next day if you do something wrong it's blacked it out you get a bad review well for selling the killer we're fixing to get a bad review but they didn't care they laid their life then laid their neck down they stuck their neck out for Paul and to whom not only I give thanks but also all the churches of the Gentiles likewise greet the church that is in their house that house meeting there so it my well-beloved it
