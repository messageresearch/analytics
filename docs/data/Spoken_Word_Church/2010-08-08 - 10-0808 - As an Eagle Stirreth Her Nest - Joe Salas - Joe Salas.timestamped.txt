[0:00] morning
[0:02] morning I guess we better open the
[0:04] service of prayer
[0:07] first say heavenly
[0:10] father I thank you Lord for allowing us
[0:12] to be here today and uh Lord we pray for
[0:15] brother Wade and sister
[0:17] June and just give us what we have
[0:19] needed for today Lord we pray this in
[0:22] Jesus name
[0:25] amen
[0:28] okay I'm not a preacher teacher speaker
[0:32] but God put something on my heart so uh
[0:35] amen my brother and said a few weeks ago
[0:38] he said uh total
[0:41] obedience usually when we go to a
[0:43] nursing home I write a paper or some
[0:45] kind of subject and
[0:49] uh with my with the help of Brother
[0:52] Joseph we wrote a a paper on Eagles so
[0:56] today I just want to expound on it a
[0:58] little bit so
[1:02] did you turn that on
[1:07] okay okay let's let's read our first
[1:10] scripture Deuteronomy
[1:17] 321 he said as an eagle stirred up her
[1:20] nest fluttered over her young spreaded
[1:23] abro or Wings taken them bear them on
[1:26] her
[1:28] wings
[1:33] in the eagle in her nest brother B said
[1:36] a
[1:37] word he said the eagle the word means
[1:40] one feeding with which is a beautiful
[1:43] type of God who feeds his children by
[1:46] his mouth his word he said men shall not
[1:49] let by bread alone but by every word
[1:52] that proceed out of the mouth of God so
[1:55] he's the eagle that feeds his little
[1:57] eaglet with his word he said I believe
[2:00] in the
[2:06] word in the message as the eagle starts
[2:09] her dress he said and the church is
[2:12] starving today for some of that word
[2:15] there nothing will take this place no
[2:18] not nothing will take the place of the
[2:21] to the Eagles but the real food Eagles
[2:24] food and we are eagles so we have to
[2:28] have Eagles food not social Gatherings
[2:31] not political
[2:33] speeches or some little Stitch and so
[2:36] party but we need some Eagle
[2:39] food food fed from the mouth of Jehovah
[2:43] Eagle that's why he liken us un
[2:46] Eagles Eagle food comes from the mouth
[2:49] of the feter not some manmade theology
[2:53] but from the mouth of the feeder which
[2:55] is Jehovah Eagle who feeds with his own
[2:58] word
[3:00] and the eagle will never bring her
[3:02] babies anything that would hurt them he
[3:05] said oh I just love that God will never
[3:08] make a promise that he won't stand
[3:10] behind and every Eagle just loves to get
[3:13] a hold of that word he loves it because
[3:16] it comes from the mouth of Jehovah Eagle
[3:20] he loves to receive it right then he
[3:24] said uh a lot of the Cat come from the
[3:26] eagle as the eagle stirs her nest so if
[3:30] I don't say what it comes from that's
[3:31] where it comes
[3:32] from he said did you ever see an eagle
[3:35] compromis he said no sir there there's
[3:38] no compromising in
[3:41] him neither does a genuine Christian he
[3:44] ain't
[3:45] soft he will hunt till he finds it yes
[3:49] sir he will find his meat he wants fresh
[3:52] Mana he will get that there and dig till
[3:55] he finds
[3:56] it he said he'll fly higher and higher
[3:59] if it's not in the valley he will rise a
[4:02] little higher the higher you go the more
[4:05] you can see so it's time for the Eagles
[4:08] of this day to get flying higher dig
[4:11] into
[4:12] God's promises not live on wult your
[4:15] food that's been killed years ago get
[4:19] out of
[4:28] it okay Exodus
[4:46] 194 Bible said you have seen what I did
[4:49] unto the Egyptians and how I bear you on
[4:52] Eagle wings and I brought you onto
[4:56] myself the two great wings of the eagle
[5:00] are for deliverance they also represent
[5:03] the old and the New
[5:15] Testament in the message the coming of
[5:17] the Lord Brother R said the prophet
[5:21] prophesied 28 or 38 years ago when they
[5:25] come out of their captivity God will
[5:28] bring them forth on the we wings of
[5:30] eagles he said the prophet saw the plane
[5:33] coming he saw them sitting down and
[5:35] picking them up and taking them back to
[5:38] the Homeland he didn't know what to call
[5:40] it he he just it just looked like an
[5:43] eagle to him so he said they brought
[5:45] them back on the eagil
[5:48] wings that's when the Jews went back to
[5:51] their
[5:55] Homeland as the eagle stirred up her
[5:57] Ness he said the eagle also a squi with
[6:00] two great powerful wings and the
[6:03] feathers you cannot pull them out with a
[6:05] pair of
[6:06] pliers oh they have to be tight or when
[6:09] he gets up in that altitude and them
[6:11] storms they would come on and he'll fall
[6:15] so he's got two wings and I'm going to
[6:18] liken them those two Wings to the New
[6:21] and Old Testament that Jehovah Eagle
[6:23] spreads out before
[6:28] us
[6:30] The God Who is rich in
[6:32] Mercy and today the holy spirit is here
[6:35] to vindicate God's word and that's the
[6:37] eagle Wing that we're supposed to write
[6:39] on he said not some men made theology
[6:43] but we are to write upon the wings of
[6:46] the eagle to the promised land
[6:58] amen okay
[7:02] I just want to talk a little bit about
[7:03] the eagle okay the eyesa the eagle is
[7:07] eight times more powerful than man the
[7:10] eagle is covered with two set of eyelids
[7:13] one set is for flight and the other one
[7:15] is used to fly directly into the
[7:22] sun okay Isaiah
[7:28] 4031
[7:40] but they they wait upon the Lord shall
[7:42] renew their strength they shall Mount up
[7:45] with wings as eagles they shall run and
[7:47] not be weary and they shall walk and not
[7:58] thinkt
[8:12] he said brother said I believe in the
[8:14] word he tells the eag renewing his youth
[8:18] it been it had been thought that the
[8:20] eagle would ever so often renew his
[8:23] youth bring itself to being young again
[8:27] we said later we found out that it does
[8:29] not exactly renew his youth but what
[8:31] happens is that there are times when it
[8:34] feels so good that it acts young
[8:46] again okay let me make some El
[8:50] here eagles mostly live about 60 years
[8:53] old there is a time in an eagle's life
[8:57] called a moping season and they get
[8:59] really sick almost to the point of death
[9:02] so they build a lot of calcium on their
[9:04] beaks they can't fly or walk so they
[9:08] beat their beats on the rocks to knock
[9:10] some of the calcium off Eagles Fly and
[9:14] give them food for survival during this
[9:16] time and some will live and some will
[9:19] die just like the Christian
[9:23] spiritually if you're an eagle you have
[9:25] to eat Eagle's food which is the
[9:27] inflamable word of God
[9:32] now if we are eagles when a brother or
[9:35] sister gets in the valley we are
[9:36] supposed to help them get back in the
[9:38] Heavenly right amen
[9:48] sir he
[9:49] said I have seen people who are bound in
[9:52] wheelchairs and upon dead beds with
[9:54] cancer but when God's spirit swept their
[9:57] Revival they were renew and swar out of
[10:00] the Wheelchairs and out of the Cs
[10:03] rejoicing Our
[10:04] God he said our God renews us he renews
[10:08] our health he renews our strength he
[10:10] renews Our Hope amen he's con constantly
[10:14] renewing us renewing us do you see there
[10:18] ones why we are likened to Eagles we are
[10:22] renewed and spirit as they
[10:28] are
[10:31] God lightens his uh prophets into
[10:38] Eagles he said God La prophets to Eagles
[10:42] the higher you go the farther you can
[10:44] see he said if you're going to go high
[10:47] in Heaven Got the Eye to see father it
[10:50] would do no good to go higher so when
[10:54] God he takes us up get higher gives us
[10:58] ability to see see farther I like that
[11:00] the higher you go the further you can
[11:03] see that's
[11:18] right here's another God like His
[11:20] prophets and also to the holy spirit
[11:23] will take a prophet way up high in the
[11:26] Heavenly atmosphere and show him many
[11:28] things that will come to pass in the
[11:30] future he took
[11:34] nahem he said on the Old Testament so
[11:38] high that he saw the Cs which have to
[11:41] which we have today and how they were
[11:42] colliding with one
[11:44] another on the roads and he said the
[11:46] Chariot chariots will rage in the
[11:48] streets they shall just just one one
[11:52] against another in the Broadways they
[11:55] shall they shall seem like torches they
[11:58] shall run like
[11:59] Lightnings Paul was taken up so high he
[12:02] saw the last days where men would be
[12:05] truth Breakers false accusers
[12:07] incontinent Fierce despisers of those
[12:10] that are good traitors hated highminded
[12:13] lovers of pleasure more than lovers of
[12:16] God having a form of godliness by
[12:19] denying the power thereof Paul as God's
[12:23] eagle soar up into the God's rim and saw
[12:26] all this then returned to warn us about
[12:29] it oh thank the
[12:31] Lord you said when I think of eagles and
[12:34] Prophets how they fly compared to poor
[12:37] Earthbound chicken they was determined
[12:40] that her Brew shall not be like
[12:42] Earthbound
[12:44] chickens she will see to that now a
[12:48] chicken may be your denominational
[12:50] brother but he knows nothing about
[12:52] heaven Le he has never been up there and
[12:56] those old Barnard chickens will sit on
[12:58] their Old Neck and cackle he said
[13:01] there's no such thing as Divine Healing
[13:03] there's no such thing as speaking in
[13:05] tongues there's no such thing of the
[13:07] baptism of the Holy Ghost I like this
[13:10] right here he says well how does he know
[13:11] he has never been out at the Barnard to
[13:13] find out he has never saw the blue
[13:16] Heavens that God's Great spiritual
[13:18] sights amen
[13:27] right we said the chicken is a bird just
[13:30] as the eagle but the chicken knows
[13:31] little about Heavenly Heavenly at
[13:34] atmosphere and speaking of eagles he
[13:37] said I'm reminded of a farmer West who
[13:40] put up West who put an eagle egg in with
[13:44] a s of chicken when it hatched out it
[13:46] was one of the funniest looking little
[13:48] little thing all the other chickens
[13:50] chirp and he couldn't understand why
[13:52] they were chirping about because he
[13:56] spoke a different language I hope you
[13:57] know what I mean he watched him he
[13:59] didn't know what to do they all picked
[14:01] on him because they said he was an out
[14:05] fellow I'll probably read a little bit
[14:07] more about that
[14:21] so the eagle builds his nest 10,000 ft
[14:24] high on the Cliff of the rock uh this a
[14:27] type of a Christian believer and
[14:29] understand that Jesus Christ is God and
[14:31] place and Upon This Rock Jesus Built his
[14:35] built his
[14:40] church brother BR talks a little about
[14:43] this he said in Palestine the are 40
[14:45] types of eagles and for for centuries I
[14:50] read a book so a lot of this stuff came
[14:51] off a book not brother message so
[14:56] said he said for centuries the eagle has
[14:58] been recognized by many nations kingdoms
[15:01] and Empires as the king of birds the
[15:05] eagle is a sign of Freedom strength
[15:08] immortality and Authority man has repr
[15:11] reproduced an image of the eagle on
[15:13] coins emblems seals and flags the eagle
[15:17] is a Heavenly bird it can fly and see
[15:19] farther than any other bird then he
[15:22] talks about the chicken too the chicken
[15:23] is a bird just the eagle is but it's
[15:26] Earthbound creature and it can Flop and
[15:29] Fly a little but he can scarcely get his
[15:31] feet off the
[15:33] ground another thing I F I found about
[15:35] the eagle that uh when they find a
[15:38] mate and one of the birds dies they do
[15:41] not look for another mate so I guess
[15:43] they're harder than we are on marriage
[15:45] and
[15:57] for
[16:21] another thing I want you to notice is
[16:23] this a mother egole would not build her
[16:25] nest on the ground she goes to the
[16:27] highest mountain peak
[16:29] the mother Eagle makes her nest in the
[16:31] Rock feeds her little ones and one day
[16:34] she decide that she does not want her
[16:35] brw to be like chickens a chicken is it
[16:39] is a a bird just the eagle is but it's
[16:41] an earth down creature it can Flop and
[16:44] Fly a little but he can scarcely get his
[16:47] feet off the
[16:51] ground he said this reminds me of
[16:54] uh so-called Christianity which some
[16:57] people have today just enough religion
[16:59] to make them miserable you may be able
[17:02] to say that you have that your name on
[17:04] the book but have you ever sore in the
[17:07] heavenlies he said the eagle never makes
[17:10] his nest down here on Earth he makes it
[17:12] just as high in a rock as he can he is a
[17:16] type of the Church of the Living God
[17:18] what a blessed privilege it is to know
[17:21] that God has hidden Us in the Cliff of
[17:23] the rock the calvary far beyond the
[17:26] hollow of the enemy m
[17:29] of the all the Privileges that we have
[17:32] he said I up there in the rocket where
[17:34] the mother Eagle gives birth to her
[17:37] little ones she nurtures them cares for
[17:40] them high in the rock where the coyote
[17:43] could not never climb she's Beyond them
[17:47] I'm so glad that we have a heavenly
[17:49] father who will will if we permit him
[17:53] put us in a place where the Hing of the
[17:55] Devils cannot bother us and where the L
[17:58] door a whiskey and nightclubs cannot
[18:01] touch us far beyond the polluted streams
[18:03] of this world and his
[18:06] fantasies he said now when the eagle
[18:08] builds her nest she gets Vines and
[18:11] sticks and leaves and pieces of wood and
[18:14] Bri she she's very careful as she does
[18:17] not want her little babies to be pierced
[18:19] by the Bri or have pieces of sticks
[18:22] poking them so what does he she do she
[18:25] goes and finds a lamb and slays it and
[18:28] she take the Lamb's skin to their nest
[18:30] and shreds it and works it around until
[18:34] she has a nest real Coy and comfortable
[18:37] for her babies and that is what God does
[18:40] for us when God sees we're about to be
[18:43] born again he watches US during the
[18:46] service to see what we will do don't
[18:48] forget that and he will prepare a nest
[18:50] for you in his kingdom for he
[18:53] knows soon another Eagle will be born to
[18:56] him amen
[18:58] as his Spirit rules you notice how warm
[19:01] and Soo sooth you feel notice it's not
[19:05] God the land that makes you abod so
[19:08] lovely and peaceful and safe he's the
[19:11] land of your nest your abod praise the

[21:20] Jacob's Ladder then you can climb to the
[21:23] highest spots to where all things are
[21:25] possible to them that believe
[21:29] but you got to be an eagle a Believer he
[21:32] said don't try the Hebrews they cross as
[21:36] Eagles across the Red Sea then non

[22:04] ago and I fuss that you all week telling
[22:07] you about how far we lost off from there
[22:12] but we were so advanced in the spirit of
[22:14] God into other things that we got now
[22:18] that they never even had back there so
[22:21] they left the automobiles got to their
[22:23] feet off and in the air so they could
[22:27] have a few spiritual gifts speaking in
[22:29] tongues shouting singing spiritual songs
[22:33] Bo they was floating around up there
[22:35] like butterflies see certainly that was
[22:38] a great age but he said oh brother we
[22:41] are lifted far beyond that now the
