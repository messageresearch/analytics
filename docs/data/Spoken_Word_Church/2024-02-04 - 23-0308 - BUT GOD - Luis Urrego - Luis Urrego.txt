that bone amen or through whatever or through that Ox goe I believe it was amen and was able to Target that Ox go exactly where it needed to hit praise God and killed 600 Philistines with it amen that's God what a wonderful God that we serve amen sometimes we find ourselves in situations amen that that uh uh predi predicaments amen that we can't explain we don't even know how we get there sometimes but eventually we realize oh my goodness I got I'm I'm surrounded by all these four walls I've I'm surrounded by this problem this thing's happening in my life this thing's going on in my life amen and you don't know you don't have a way out amen but God but God Amen he's the way out he is the way the truth and the life amen and no man can come to the father unless through him he is the way out amen when there seems to be no way out amen but God God comes on the scene right at the at at the time when you need him the most how how many can testify that God has done that for you amen I believe that each one of us could could could we could stay here all night just just talking about the times amen that Satan had come in amen and and and tried to uh ruin our lives and and and stepped in and and but God Amen came on the scene and changed the whole thing praise the Lord Jesus amen so I and looking at this here I want to I want to look at um you know in the previous chapter Paul mentions and he's talking about Jesus Christ and how God had raised him up and had sit him and and and and and put him Above All Things amen and then in verse 22 of Ephesians chapter 1 he says and hath put all things under his feet and gave him to be the head over all things to the church amen and watch what he says in the last verse of that chapter it says which is his body the fullness of him that filth all in all so he's calling you and I the church amen his body praise the Lord Jesus he is the head we are the body amen and wherever the head thinks whatever the head thinks that's where the body goes amen my arm cannot move unless my mind my my my my brain thought about it right praise God see my I got a thinking brain right now your body will will not move unless your brain thinks about it first same thing with the word amen if he is the head amen you will not move unless the head says so praise the Lord unless the head tells me so amen that's when I move unless the word tells me so that's when I move praise God I don't have to follow the philos philosophies of man I don't have to go by amen about the the the the the the things of this life amen if the word says so that's where I'll stand praise God I'd rather be in front of God amen dying for his word amen testifying hey Lord I stood for your word and I stood firm amen amen then to be ashamed amen one day because I didn't stand for all of his word amen and then in chapter two it says he says here and you he continues the thought he says and you hath he quickened now he's he makes it personal he makes it and you haveth he quickened amen what is quickened amen Quicken is means to make alive amen he he he hath quickened who were dead in trespasses and sins praise the Lord Jesus who were dead in trespasses and sins amen it reminds me back of Romans chap 6:2 where it says that you were dead to sin dead to sin how can you be dead to sin and still live in it you see now here we were dead in trespasses and sins amen but now as Christians amen we should be dead to sin praise the Lord but here we were dead in trespasses and sins you know uh we we were we were actually walking zombies all right they they're the living dead right it's what the world tells us amen and then they're they're they're dead but with a semblance of life that's what a zombie is and that's what you and I were amen before Christ came and changed our lives amen you were dead and you were but yet you were walking you were following the rudiments of this world you were you you were moving and you think that you were getting somewhere but you were dead while you were yet alive how many can say you were dead I was dead amen I have no I had no life amen we were numb amen insensitive amen callous to sin right amen we they we did things amen and it didn't bother us one bit brother but the way testify he says he'd go and get a beer amen or go drink beer or or or or whatever didn't bother him one bit go out and caral it didn't bother one bit amen go out to the bar it didn't bother you one bit amen you were calloused you were dead amen and that's what Paul is saying here who were dead in trespasses and sins praise the Lord that's why the Bible says that we need to be born again because you were born dead am you there's already you were born dead on arriv Ral you that that's the reason and sometimes sometimes our young people say why do I need to be born again for what what I'm not I'm not steal I'm not robbing banks I'm not killing anybody I'm not doing this but you were the Bible says that you were born dead praise the Lord have you ever told a lie if you can't say that you've never told a lie amen you're you're sinning right there amen we all have sinned the Bible says and come short of the glory of God Amen so Paul's here is saying and you who hath he quickened amen now I like that he brings in first you hath he quickened amen he's made you alive you who were dead he has made you alive verse two wherein in time pass ye walked according to the course of this world according to the prince of the power of the Earth the spirit that now worketh in the children of Disobedience you know Saints we we don't wrestle against flesh and blood but against powers and principalities amen against the spirits amen and this is what Paul is saying here against the prince of the power of the air the spirit that now worketh in the children of Disobedience but thank God Amen that he amen has changed our lives amen we don't have to be children of Disobedience anymore prise praise the Lord Jesus the spirit that now worketh in the children of Disobedience were you a child of Disobedience amen I mean I could just I I remember my my myself you know disobeying my parents and paying for it too you w going to get away with it you thought you'd get get away with it and and if you can't get away with it from your parents how much more God you get older and that's the reason why it's so important us as parents Amen to take care of that right there and then cuz they'll learn hey you disobey am you're going to get you're going to suffer the consequences and that's why people we we got these people growing up later on in life and they feel like there's no consequences of the things that they do cuz they never suffered consequences when they were younger and they get older and they do and and undo and they don't feel con consequences for it because mom and dad is always there to bail them out or her out you see so it's very important amen that uh that that that we do that amen I better stop before I get in trouble but according to the prince of the power of the air the spirit that now worketh in the children of Disobedience amen now verse three it says among whom also we all had our conversation in in times past in the lust of our flesh fulfilling the desires of the Flesh and of the mind and we by Nature the children of Wrath as others amen amen so we see here from verse one this is what's this is what's being dead in sins and in in and in trespasses amen is what what Paul said this is exactly what what being dead in sins and in trespasses we were all had our conversation in times past in the lust of our flesh fulfilling the desires of the flesh you weren't thinking of God I wasn't thinking of God Amen but God was thinking of you the whole time go ahead and let him get to a point where I can really really really get a hold of him or her go ahead go ahead I'm just waiting for that right time where he can where where you he can soften you up amen and in in such a way am amen where you can't do nothing but get back to God praise the Lord Jesus so let that's how you and I were amen we have to get to the worst of the worst amen amen in order for us to realize that we needed him amen and so we see our young people we see family members we see people in in in in in in in our day amen people that we live with friends amen even people that we go to church with amen taking these same routes and the best thing that you and I could do is just let go amen let go and let God do the work cuz when God does the work amen it's going to be done perfect amen yes it's going to be done good because you and I were in the same condition and it took us amen it took us to be in that condition for us to realize we needed him amen so we were dead in sins amen lusting amen sinning drinking cursing doing everything amen and it didn't bother us one bit amen praise the Lord Jesus fulfilling the desires of the Flesh and of the mind and where by Nature the children of Wrath even as others now I like it that Paul also he mentions he puts himself in there as well he says we he doesn't say just you he says we he included himself also in there praise the Lord Jesus the pastor and the the the the the the Ley all along they but they need the new birth amen we all need the new birth but verse four says this it says but God but God Amen but God makes it makes a difference amen because whatever was before but amen it's changed after but amen you you could say uh uh I was I was driving down the road uh uh uh and and I was I was going this speed and and and then a car pulled out in front of me but then amen I slammed on the brakes just in time and it changed the whole thing you see and this is what Paul is trying to tell us right here but God Amen he's the one that makes the difference he's the one that makes the change amen he's the one one that that that that makes things amen look good amen when they don't look good amen but God who is rich in Mercy amen for his great love where withth he loved us amen I'm so glad that he uh he is full of Mercy rich in Mercy not just rich in in in in in money amen thisen what look what brother brandham says here and in in and the brothers could bring it up he says he says in the message The God Who is rich in Mercy he says I want you to notice here of the Prophet Apostle rather Paul who how he made mention of this how you hath he quickened who were once dead you hath he quickened who were once dead dead in sin and trespasses walking after the things of the world the desires of Flesh and fulfilling the desires of the mind has what caused this what caused this change see yes what caused this change you see what caused this from one time being dead to quickened am amen what caused that change quickened means Made Alive there was a change from Death unto life there's no other there's no other thing that could happen to any person so great as the changing from Death to life let's read that again there's no greater thing that could happen to any person so great as the changing from Death to life amen remember we were all in sins and trespasses amen but we were saved amen but we came to we I mean but God was seeking us amen praise the Lord to any person so great as the changing from Death To Life a man if he was dying physically and could be healed physically that would be a great thing but nothing so great as when he is spiritually dead and God has quickened him to life amen how many believe that that can happen how many can say that you've experienced that praise the Lord so if if you've experienced it in your life amen then there's a chance amen an opportunity by the mercy of God that it can happen to your family member that it can happen to your children that it can happen to that loved one amen that you've been crying and praying for such a long time amen but God let God do the work amen amen when when I try to do the work amen it it will fail but God Amen that makes the difference spiritually dead and God has qu Quicken him to life you once in times Past Dead you were dead even many here tonight one time can look back and know that you were dead amen but now why aren why aren't you dead tonight as you were then you deserve to be the that way because you was a sinner but God who is rich in Mercy that's the thing right there God who was rich all these things that we were but God that made the change right there God who is rich in Mercy oh I'm so glad for that he being rich in Mercy if he was just rich in money if he was just rich in materials which he is amen but yet the greatest thing is being rich in Mercy oh what a great word that is praise the Lord Jesus how that we were once dead amen amen I like the way brother Brandon put that there praise the Lord am so Paul here amen speaking in verse verses 1 through3 speaking about how dead we were reminding us of where we come from and then in the next several verses the whole thing changes but God praise the Lord Jesus so wonderful Amen to know that God can change the situation who is rich in Mercy for his great love amen it doesn't just say his is he has Mercy but it says rich in Mercy amen and it doesn't say that he just has love amen but great love wherewith he loved us in so much amen that he was willing to die on a cross for you to take your place praise the Lord Jesus and you know Saints you know the the the the the story of the Cross doesn't see seems like it doesn't do anything for us anymore great that's a dangerous ground to be on when the story of the Cross doesn't seem to move you anymore doesn't seem to do anything for you amen that's that's dangerous Crown amen but I'm so I'm so glad because that's where he displayed his great love amen even when we were dead in sins hath quickened us together with Christ by grace are you saved now I want to I want us to go to to John chapter John chapter 2 amen uh is it John Chapter 2 the brothers have it up there John chap 11 I'm sorry John chapter 11 because Paul he he's talking about here about a people who were Dead Walking Dead amen but now who are alive now we know that God Amen he he he he he wherever he's at amen there's Resurrection yeah there can't be there can't be death amen wherever he's at there can't be anything dead amen whenever he's around praise the Lord and so we're looking here at the at at at at the story of of uh of Lazarus amen and I just want to point out a few things here we're not going to read the whole chapter we'll just kind of skip through it and it says here now certain man was sick named Lazarus of Bethany the town of Mary and her sister Martha it was that Mary which anointed the Lord with ointment and wiped his feet with her hair whose brother Lazar was sick therefore his sister sent unto him saying Lord Behold Him whom thou lovest is sick when Jesus heard that he said this sickness is not unto death but for the glory of God Amen the sickness is not unto death but for the glory of God that's going to make the difference right there amen that the Son of God watch that the Son of God might be glorified thereby so Jesus wasn't wasn't concerned I mean I'm sure in his human ways he was but he knew that this was the sickness was to glorify him to glorify God now Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus when he had heard therefore that he was sick he Abode two days still in the same place where he was can you imagine that amen can you imagine Jesus hearing that you're sick and he waits and you ask the lord lord I've been going through this for weeks now been going in and out of of therapy sessions and and chemotherapy and doing all this and and it seems like the Lord doesn't answer that's exactly what was happening here with Lazarus and and and and and and the two sisters I mean Lazarus was dead Lazarus didn't know what was going on right his two sisters were the ones who called for Jesus to come amen and they thought that every time that he would call them that they would call them he could just come but he didn't he didn't he didn't he says then after that let's see he Abode two days still in the same place where he was in other words he waited then after that Seth he to his disciples let us go into Judea again two days he waited while Lazarus was sick yeah yeah you know sometimes we we're asking the Lord day after day after day it doesn't matter when the Lord's going to do things amen just believe that God will do things amen praise God just believe that he will amen because he promised it in his word his disciples say unto him Master the Jews of late Sal to Stone thee and goest thou dither again Jesus answered are there not let's let's just skip down but if a man walk in the night he stumbleth because there is no light in him these things said he verse 11 and after that he said unto them our friend Lazarus sleepeth but I go that I may awake him out of sleep but I amen is he the one that's going to make the difference praise the Lord Jesus now you have to believe that amen you have to stand firm on what God Said in in his word amen because he doesn't have to do things exactly right then when you ask him to brother no he has a better he knows exactly what you need it's just like us as parents we can't give our children everything at the right M every time they ask us amen because it doesn't work that way it can't work that way later on they become spoiled and they expect for you to give them everything and they expect it right there and then and God doesn't want us to be spoiled brats so he makes us wait for his time not our time for his time see Jesus could have gone he could he could have heard the the news and said let's go let's go right away let's go take care of this he could have done it but he had to wait up the father first to show him maybe the father already showed him what to do and that's what he needed to to do but that was for the benefit of Martha and and and and Mary but I go that I may awake him out of sleep then said his disciples Lord if he sleep he shall do well let's skip down to verse 14 then said Jesus unto them plainly Lazarus is dead and I am glad for your sakes that I was not there can you imagine the Lord Jesus saying such a thing I am glad that I wasn't there you real like what kind of Jesus am I serving that would tell me such a thing I'm glad I didn't heal you when you asked me to heal you I'm glad I didn't save your child at the moment when you asked me to I'm glad I didn't do this and that or the other amen cuz I've got I'm working on something right now it's going to be such a it's going to be so great it's going to be much better than just amen your child coming to the Lord amen cuz because everybody's going to be worked on from the mom and the dad to the sisters to the to the family the church house even amen something good is going to come out of this everybody will know amen that God saved my child that God Amen somebody everybody's going to be affected by it praise the Lord everybody is going to be affected by the healing of your body it ain't just going to be for you it ain't just going to be amen for you or your husband amen it's going to be for everybody to give me praise I will get the glory out of this amen from everyone Hallelujah that's how God likes to do things amen he looks at the whole picture and not just at the moment where of what you're asking him at the moment because he knows exactly what you need amen eventually and you know what that makes it that makes it even a greater Miracle then amen the fact that he made you wait yes right not that he couldn't do it he could do it right there and then sure but the fact that he you having to wait amen brings patience amen amen brings faith in his word amen brings calm amen amen and lets you give things over to him that and says Lord I'm done worrying about this you take care of it amen you take care of it and what you know it's when when when you know when when when you're looking for something around your house and you know you're looking for it and and you can't find it you're just looking for it everywhere and you can't find it let's say it's it's it's it's the those who had watch TV at the house amen maybe you're looking for the remote amen and you can't find it so you go and buy a universal remote from the store and when you walk into the door there's your remote right there that's right that you were looking and searching through all your house you sort of pick up the the the the cushion from the couch and there was the remote right there the whole time amen well that's what's God that that's how God does things amen he gives you a double blessing you get two remotes [Laughter] now just just that's my analogy but you shouldn't have TV at your house anyway but speaking of TV amen this is worse all right this is this is worse I mean TV ain't nothing anymore I don't even know who still watches TV it's that's old now who has who still has cable and all that stuff and nobody hardly ever does that anymore cuz it's all here this is more dangerous now We Got the Whole World in Your Hands to you know just a couple limited channels on a TV but anyway let me get off that but you got two remotes now amen see now when you wait God gives you a double blessing because it's not just now amen what you were praying for that's answered but God was working on you the whole time as well amen God was working on others amen and God Amen does things perfect amen amen where we were at here then when Jesus came he found that he had lay in the grave four days already now he wouldn't have been laying in the grave four days already if he had went when Martha and Lazarus had asked for him we wouldn't be reading this in the in the Bible do you I believe that when he would have gotten there Lazarus would have been raised from the dead actually he wouldn't have died he would would have been able to heal him right but it's a greater Miracle after he died it's a better thing amen because he was dead amen but God steps on the scene and it becomes a greater Miracle then praise the Lord Jesus now Bethany was nigh unto Jerusalem about 15 furlongs off I don't know exactly how much is 15 furlongs but um it doesn't seem like maybe he was wasn't too he was he wasn't too far off and many of the Jews came to Martha and Mary to comfort them concerning their brother then Martha as soon as she heard I like this right here then Martha as soon as she heard that Jesus was coming went and met him she just heard that Jesus was coming and she went to go meet him she didn't know if he was coming or not she just heard I'm going to go meet him amen that's the same thing with you and I Saints amen when the Bible tells us so amen or you just hear it from the word you heard that preacher say it amen you take that upon your heart and you say Lord I believe that with all my heart I'm putting it into action I'm going to meet you right there amen then Martha as soon as she heard that Jesus was com and went and met him but Mary sat still in the house then said Martha unto Jesus Lord what what's the the the the the how how how Martha approaches him if thou had us been here my brother had not died Amen in other words Lord I know that you he would still be alive if you were if you if you were here in other words he's letting him you know he's he's she's praising him amen You Are the Healer you are the Savior you are the one amen but I know watch J says but I know amen that even now who whatsoever thou will ask ask of God God will give it to thee amen I know that my my my my brother he he he wouldn't have died if you were here amen but I know now the fact that you're here I know that whatever you ask him amen God will grant it to him Jesus said unto her thy Brothers not might Rise Again thy brother shall rise again amen what a positive word that God God gave her amen and everywhere you look in the Bible amen it's what Paul was talking to us there in Ephesians amen it was a positive word to you and I amen we were dead but we are alive amen walking in him but I know that even now whatsoever oh Jesus said unto her thy brother shall rise again Martha said unto him I know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day Jesus said unto her I am the resurrection am you got to know that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek Him amen not that he was that's wonderful and not that he will amen but that he is right now praise God I am the resurrection and the life he that believeth in me though he were dead right yet shall he live yes and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die and the question is believest thou this amen I I was asking the young people there in in Honduras this in one of the services there in at the the Youth Camp believest thou this do you believe that what God Said in his word about you receiving the Holy Spirit receiving the Holy Ghost having a change in your life letting go of pornography in your life letting go of of of of these things that that take a hold of you amen that are amen do you believe that God can do it amen cuz they have a custom amen custom time and time again they go up to the front asking the Lord Lord please save me please fill me with the Holy Ghost and and I said why don't you just come and believe that God can do it go to your seat believ it and stay believing believe do you believe what he said in your word about you praise God that's the problem with us amen we we we we feel like there's something more that we have to do there's still little something that some unturned Corner that amen when all he asked Martha is do you believe what I'm telling you is the truth do you believe that I can do this do you believe that God can heal your body amen do you believe that God can touch your your children do you believe that God can do whatever amen it is that's that's the problem the four walls around your life amen do you believe that he can we see many examples in the word where he has amen amen you take a look at uh you take a look at at at at Joseph's life amen Joseph's life let's let's let's read here in in in Acts chapter 7 I didn't give this to the brothers but the the brothers can bring it up Acts 7:7 it says and the nation to whom they shall be in bondage will I judge said God and after that they after that shall they come forth and serve me in this place and he gave him the Covenant of circumcision so Abraham begat Isaac and circumcised him the Eighth Day and Isaac begat Jacob and Jacob begat the 12 Patriarchs and the Patriarchs moved with Envy sold Joseph into Egypt but God was with him amen the situ situation look Grim can you imagine Joseph a teenager going to go he was obeying his dad taking him food they were out in the in out in the fields you know doing their shepherding and and doing what they were doing and here comes Joseph you know just happy you know and he's got food and and and and and thinking that his brothers loved him and and some of them had such a hate for him cuz they were jealous of him I don't know if you have seen the movie that the movie Joseph it's it's it's it's a good one to watch and he's he's happy he's like Brethren my brethren and he he's and there like what does he want now that dreamer that you know they were just they were they were they were they were jealous of him and they sold him you know the story they sold him Amen to to to slavery just imagine a teenage boy about 15 16 years old I don't know just hearing that people crying and saying I'll take I I I'll give you this and this and that and he's he's wondering what's going on what where's my brethren and he's probably crying out right there in the in in and maybe he's still in the pit I don't know maybe they they took him out he's in Chains obviously and he's he's bound he can't do anything and his brothers are right there selling him before him in front of him I don't think we're in that bad of a shape some of us I know some of us were going through some tough things a teenage boy going through that thing and then he goes to the house of Piper so sold to the house of Piper and and and and and then the Lord starts working in his life and using him and and then Here Comes Piper's wife accuses him of of of of of doing something that he didn't do and he gets thrown into a prison amen gets thrown into a prison where he's there with the with the Butler and and and the and the bread the the the the other the baker yes and they have dreams and God Amen if he wasn't in that situation he would not have been able to interpret dreams because it was through that situation that he was able to get out of there amen and and and and and and and come higher amen so he needed to be in that prison he needed to be accused falsely he needed to be sold to Egypt so that he could Ascend to the point where he where he got to amen that's why the Bible said but God was with him the whole time everything that looked grim and looked bad but God was with him it just doesn't seem like it Lord I don't see where you are with me I'm I I I'm still I'm still sick I'm still feeling pain I'm still uh feeling all these things but God promised that he would be with you even in you to the end of the world it didn't matter how much cancer was going through your body it didn't matter how much uh you know your family is not serving the lord it didn't matter it doesn't matter if the whole church backslides amen God promised that he would be with you just as he said he would be with Joseph but God was with him and and watch in verse 10 and delivered him out of all his afflictions and gave him favor and wisdom in the sight of pharaoh king of Egypt and he made him Governor over Egypt and all his house it all started with him being sold as a teenager right and being lied about and being hated by his Brethren his own Brethren to being pretty much second in command in Egypt and we know the story later on you know he saves his family because of that through the famine amen what a wonderful thing am amen we could read throughout the Bible amen all the different things the children of Israel crossing the Red Sea amen here it comes oh they were praising the Lord thank God he took us out with a mighty hand and they come to the Red Sea and here comes the Egyptians on behind them there's mountains on the left there's mountains on the right and a big red sea right in front of them but God Amen but God Amen Moses couldn't open the sea neither could the people amen but God was able to open the sea amen and they crossed on dry ground but they had to get to that point yep right if you think that you can become a Christian and not have a bad day in your life you're mistaken you signed up for the wrong thing amen you're going to have bad days you're going to have bad years right you it could be they could be very bad times but he promised but he promised that he would never leave us and he promised that we would our trials we would come out like gold gold is only beautiful when it goes through the fire amen when you find gold out there right next to the river bank and all that stuff it's not as beautiful it's not as pretty and that's how you and me are right when we start serving the lord and we come fresh and all that we're just like gold right there from the bank of the river you know God's taking us out amen maybe setting us aside for a little bit but it takes for him to start amen putting us through the the fire right amen and taking the dross out of our Lives amen and until he sees his own image reflected on that gold he ain't done with you yet and we going to have we're going to have good days and we're going to have bad days we're going to have good days and we're going to have good days and we're going to have good days and we're going to have really bad days and we're and that's probably going to go keep going amen bad bad bad bad maybe a year 2 3 4 5 years amen then a really good day and then immediately the next day another bad day amen but it's how you react to those things is God true or not is his word right or not did he promise that he would be with us did he promise that he would Deliver Us from all our afflictions amen he did amen the fact that you and me are still living and still sucking air that means God's not done with us [Laughter] yet right no matter what we're going through God is not through with you yet let's let's not put our our our our our children or our our case as a lost cause it's not it's not they're still here with us that means there's amen God's going to do that it's going to be even a greater Miracle hallelujah amen I can't I can't do it Lord but I know you can and I'm waiting for that moment amen praise the Lord amen going back to to to Lazarus amen Jesus said unto her I am the resurrection and the life he that believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he live and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die believe thou this she said unto him yay Lord I believe that thou art the Christ the son of God which should come into the world Amen and then if we keep keep reading down and I just I just got amazed at this you saw how Martha answered Jesus how he said she said I know that that my my my my brother is dead but I know I know that yet God can still answer your prayer she was positive was being positive but when Jesus actually comes and starts doing the the work tells the people to remove the the the stone I think it's down let's see Jesus therefore again groaning himself come to the Grave verse 38 it was a cave and a stone lay upon it Jesus said take you away the stone look who who comes and and and contradicts him Martha was the one who was telling him Lord I believe I know that you can still do it I know that you're powerful I know I know Lord I know that you could do it but when when when God is there doing the thing look what she says Martha the sister of him that Jesus said take you away the stone Martha the sister of him that was dead sath unto him Lord by this time he stinketh now she's bringing in what she sees her her her situation everything Amen in into the picture when she should have just continued he's doing what he said he would do but when we actually see him doing what what we've been asking him to do no Lord it can't be done that way no but that his ways are his perfect ways our ways stink amen his ways don't amen Jesus said take you away the stone Marth said the sister of him that was dead said unto him Lord by this time he stinketh for he hath been dead 4 days and watch what Jesus said said Jesus said unto her said I not said not unto thee that if thou wouldest believe thou should see the glory of God Amen right what a rebuke yeah what a rebuke because she clearly told him I believe that God but when God sometimes amen we ask him Lord do this for me and he's doing it we're like nah Lord I didn't want it done that way nah y man it's just like it's just like the guy I I can't think of any better another example with this I had a friend in Greenville South Carolina he said there was a man right there next to a Burger King asking for food or asking for food and money or whatever you could give him he was right there in the Burger King parking lot the guy my friend comes up to him and says here I'll buy go in here and buy you a hamburger he said no I don't want that it's too greasy but but but he was he was asking for food he he he wanted he wanted uh something else that was right next door I don't know what it what was next door you were asking that's what you were asking for right you wanted food he said well you know you want the hamburger I ain't going to give you money I don't know what ended up happening God's going to do whatever he wants to in the way he wants to he amen because he knows what's better for you now sometimes God answers things the way you know if it's according to his word amen he'll do things as we ask him amen I'm sure that that's happened many times but most of the time amen we don't we don't know how what's best for us and sometimes he has to do things his way amen and sometimes he has to tell us didn't I can I tell you that if you just believe you're going to see the glory of God if you just stand still stand still let me do it my way don't try to do it your way amen praise the Lord Jesus amen let's um let's continue let's go back to Ephesians and I'm going to get ready to close out here in just a moment and let's continue reading there in Ephesians we'll finish out here but God who is rich in Mercy for his great love wherewith he loved us Ephesians 2 verse4 even when we were dead in sins hath quickened us together with Christ amen by Grace you are saved and hath raised us up together and made us sit together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus amen and if you look at if you look at Joseph's life amen the things that he went through all that he went through amen he was made to sit amen amen in a high place Amen in a high place but he had to go through all that in order to get to that position amen that's what we got to do amen we are raised together with him amen we're sick getting together in Heavenly places with him amen in Christ Jesus it doesn't feel like it sure doesn't feel like it amen we're Walk we're we're we're we're we get up amen we go to work we we go home we we do what we need to do and sometimes it just doesn't feel like we're sitting in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus but his word says so because you the ones that are sit in Heavenly places with him is the is the church is the bride amen it's you praise God he's got a place ready for you amen amen amen and we're not just standing amen we're sitting with him in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus amen not in your own self not in anything else amen in Christ Jesus that's where you can sit in Heavenly places when you are in Christ when you are in in something else or in your own opinions or in your own thoughts you can't be in Heavenly places but when you are in Christ Jesus amen you can be in Heavenly places that in the ages to come he might show the exceeding Riches of his grace and his kindness towards us through Christ Jesus amen thank God for his grace amen Grace Grace Wonderful Grace for by grace are ye saved through faith and that not of yourselves it is the gift of God not of Works lest any man should boast in other words there's nothing that you can do to have deserved the grace of God otherwise you would have been able to boast and say I did this to obtain God's mercy and God's grace but Paul is saying there is nothing that you can do so that you don't glorify yourself so that you don't think high too high of yourself and forget about me it is not of Works lest any man should boast but it's of the grace of God Amen for we for we are his workmanship created in Christ Jesus unto good works which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them praise the Lord Jesus amen what a wonderful thing it is that we are his workmanship amen a person who a Potter or or someone that that that does carpentry or or you know amen that's a continual work amen right he just doesn't do one thing at one time just one day I'm going to think of it and then he just does it right there and then sometimes it it most of the time it takes thorough a working process amen it could be years I remember uh uh I think it was last year we we when we went to Ohio uh we were up in Ohio and we visited the the uh Amish country and we went through this little this little uh display there in one of those uh restaurants or one of those stores there they had the these displays these wooden uh works of this this art that this man the local man would would make and it was like 3D looking but it was all made of of wood it was it was beautiful just beautiful things I don't think that took him two hours to do the things that I that I saw I mean he had one that was like one of the most popular one was was the depiction of the crucifixion of Jesus and it was in such detail I mean carving out every single thing and it wasn't just Jesus on the cross it was the it was like Mary and and and the disciples around him and and and and I think even had Roman soldiers around him with the spear it was so detailed can you imagine just carving all those things out I don't think that took him one hour two hours he probably worked on that maybe for for months or or me years I don't know but you know what it became out it came out to be a beautiful display amen we are his workmanship it might take years some of us might take 40 years it took me is took 42 years and if God still has life here in another 42 2 years amen it's going to be 82 years some of us is 80 years now 85 years now amen sister ceter she's not here tonight it's taking her it's taken the Lord 96 years I don't think she can say that she is where she would like to be no I think the Lord she's probably saying Lord you're still working on me amen but until until we leave this life amen that's when God says I'm done right brother I'm done amen and I will eventually you're going to be shown Amen to the world amen amen as a full display as a beautiful thing amen amen but it took it took all that time for God to do that work amen whatever it is that God is doing in your life whatever is happening in your life Saints remember but God am that would make the difference say Satan amen you this might be happening in your life life you might allow you might put sickness in my life but God allowed that amen cuz God can't do anything amen or Satan can't do anything to me unless God allows him to do so am amen job was in that position amen we can all say different things amen sister Peggy you were you were the other day you were testifying amen how brother Dale was sick and and and and you were in a situation in a where you didn't have any help amen but God yeah stepped on the scene amen praise the Lord Jesus sister Janine you've been praying about a job when you were moving here and but God stepped on the scene right and now but God is stepping in with a house possibly amen we can all have different testimonies different things amen sister Freda is one of the more recent ones amen when brother Ronnie long came through here amen the Lord amen did something in her am amen that the next day amen she had to send that that audio through WhatsApp anden and then we heard what God did for her amen Satan was working amen but God Amen stepped on the scene for her amen and I believe that God is stepping on the scene for her even at this moment praise the Lord Jesus at this very moment you just take that word by faith sister Freda amen and just keep moving on keep moving forward he's the one that makes a difference he's the one that changes every everything was like this before but amen then it's totally different after but when God steps on the scene amen thank God for his word thank God for his promises amen but God Amen but God Amen let's stand to our feet praise the Lord um I wanted to um to show you all something real quick yeah just give me a moment the the musicians but God if the brothers could pull up the uh the screen my phone here amen I'm uh uh a brother from hondura this is Mission related but a brother from Honduras he he he contacted me uh a few weeks ago well that's him and his wife that's brother Robert brother Robert Costco and he he's a pastor there in in in in Honduras and uh I've been to his church several times preached there at his church he's a he's a wonderful trustworthy brother um he has his church doesn't have a u sufficient restrooms uh facilities for the people um there at the church as well as uh they have a a kitchen there they actually have to use his house is right next to the church so they actually have to go inside his house cook and and even the study the P the pastor's study or the or the study is in in his house so everything is done in his house so he was he's asking because they're they're going to be holding some meetings later on this year um there at the church and and and and also have uh the yearly ministerial meeting there at his church and he was wanting to to to see if he could get you know an extra you know extra facilities built at his at his place uh right there for the church as well as a little study for for the for a pastor's study and a and and the church's own little kitchen so that they don't have to use his house and and and so this is uh this is his little little house right there next to the church uh the church would be right over here this is part of the church and this is the only little the only bathroom that they have right there and um so see here that's their little kitchen right there makeshift Kitchen in the back that they have so um so they were wanting to see if they could uh upgrade that uh a little bit and then to be able to accommodate the people so he was asking for a certain amount but I'm I'm I'm I'm asking I'm asking if we could if if if the Lord puts it in your heart I told him that that uh that you know we'll see what we can do I don't make any promises to anybody who asks anything but um if we could maybe uh send him $3,000 now if you can't the if you can't that's fine but if you if the Lord puts it in your heart that you know you want to help out with this with a little portion of of of that and then what I'm going to do is the other portion that he had requested I'm going to try to see if we can if I can request it from the camp meetings in at brother Joe greens this this uh this this coming August so um so I wanted to put that out there for him because I told him that I would so you pray about it and if you if you don't if you can't do it then pray that someone would be able to send some give something towards him and uh towards this need so I put that I put that his name is brother Robert brother Robert so you know we find ourselves in situations like this and maybe brother Robert's in that situation but I know God can change things around for him amen I'll tell you a quick testimony about brother Robert brother Robert had a a man in his church last year when we were there uh two years ago when we were there and that man he was threatening the life of of of of brother Robert and his and his his family and his wife he got upset with him and uh he said that brother had just had a spirit on him and was actually physically threatening his life and stuff and uh for about a year and a half brother Robert had everywhere that he would go he'd have to go out with uh with bodyguards from his church Brothers like two or three brothers had to go out with him because this brother and he's he's such a humble man he's such a a Meek man that he did he didn't want to call the law on him he didn't want to he didn't want to that's just that's just the type of person that brother Robert is um so he was asking prayer about that so this this this brother he started going to another church locally and uh the pastor of that church knew what was going on with with the situation there at brother Robert's church between him and brother Robert and uh he told Brother uh he told that man he said listen you're not you you're welcome to come and and and and and fellowship with us here but don't expect for you to be be a deacon or for you to preach or anything like that he said for ones you need to be born again and two you need to go make things right with brother Robert and his family because you you've tortured their life or you you you caused them you know problems for a year and a half so that you know the brother Robert had asked prayer you know a year and a half ago about that and seems like the the Lord is working on this young man's life on this man's life so uh he brother Robert according to what he told me last time he said that the man isn't threatening his life anymore so God is doing something and brother Robert didn't have to put the law on on him didn't have to get him to court they didn't have to do anything he just let God do the way and God's working on working on that brother's heart amen because that's the reason why he started visiting the other church because he wanted to get back in church so you just remember that in prayer amen but God Amen God can change everything around amen turn things around amen let's let's have the brother musicians come amen let's just bow our heads and have a word of prayer and uh brother brother boy maybe if we can sing the brothers can key up a uh uh that song uh Love Lifted Me key of f key of f let's bow our heads
