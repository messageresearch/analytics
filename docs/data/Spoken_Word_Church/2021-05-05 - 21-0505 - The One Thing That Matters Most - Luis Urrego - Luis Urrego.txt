be with other believers something's wrong if you don't want to be with other believers something is wrong with your experience with god because we're supposed to have the same holy ghost brother dale has the same holy ghost that i have zach has the same holy ghost that i have that holy ghost unites us together amen that holy ghost binds us together amen and it makes us want to fellowship with one another and if you're trying to get away you're trying to uh you know seek something else hey man hurry up get out of the church amen hey something's wrong something's wrong with your experience amen

different ministers and different people uh they just send greetings to brother dale brother wade and and uh brother chris i didn't get to shake brother brother chris long was up there uh of course brother ronnie long was up there preaching he was one of the ministers his son and i got to shake his hand but i didn't get to shake brother chris sand but his wife came over to me and i had only seen his wife one time the last time she was here and so when she shook my hand and she said please tell brother dale and brother wade we just love them so much and tell them we appreciate them so much and i said you're brother long's wife right [Laughter] because i wanted to make sure you know yes yes yes so uh but we had a good time amen it was wonderful meetings and it was just a just different atmosphere amen it's just nice to be under a spout like that amen praise the lord so um let's let's just turn to the word tonight amen we want to turn to um to uh psalms chapter 27 psalms chapter 27 amen and i will do my best tonight not to take up too much of your time amen psalms chapter 27 verse 1. and we'll read down to verse 6. i think i only gave the brothers to verse 5 but we'll read down to verse 6. he says here david speaking he says the lord is my light and my salvation whom shall i fear the lord is the strength of my life of whom shall i be afraid awesome words to hear amen in the hour that we're living in when the wicked even mine enemies and my foes came upon me to eat up my flesh they stumbled and fell praise the lord though in hosts should encamp against me my heart shall not fear the war should rise against me in this will i be confident and watch what he says in verse 4 he says one thing have i desired of the lord that will i seek after that i may dwell in the house of the lord all the days of my life not just on wednesday and sunday all the days of my life and this was david in the old testament without the holy ghost wanting to dwell not just in a physical temple but to be in the presence of the lord 24 7. i don't know of any christian who would not want to be in that presence amen exactly all the days of my life to behold the beauty of the lord and to inquire in his temple for in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his pavilion and the secret of his tabernacle shall he hide me he shall set me upon a rock we know that rock is christ and now shall my head be lifted up above mine enemies round about me therefore will i offer in this tabernacle sacrifices of sadness sacrifices of depression sacrifices of bump on a log sacrifices of i already know this he says sacrifices of joy sacrifices of excitement sacrifices of praising god amen sacrifices of hey the presence of the lord is here i'm in here he's in me amen praise god sacrifices of joy i will sing yea i will sing praises unto the lord amen the lord had a blessing to the reading of his word let's just bow our heads our heavenly father we thank you lord once again for the opportunity to serve you lord thank you father god for the reading of your word for the just reading father god these these these words of life father god that lord maybe to a lot of people they don't mean anything father god but they certainly meant a lot to david they certainly mean a lot to a christian father god filled with your spirit lord jesus i pray father god that you would anoint them to our hearts father god and let us leave here different than what we came lord god lord heal the sick amongst us lord lord save those that need saving lord deliver those that need deliverance lord and you just have your will and your way in our midst lord we just commit this time into your hands i commit myself and my lips lord keep me from saying anything that would not be glorifying to you and that would not uh uh that would hinder anybody father god but lord help me to say only those things that would edify the people and glorify you we pray these things in jesus christ's name amen amen you may be seated tonight amen if i want to give this a little title this little thought amen i just want to call it amen the one thing that matters most the one thing that matters most you know david here he's saying in in in in verse in verse 4 he says one thing have i desired of the lord and that will i seek after amen praise god you know there's there's different things that we have in our lives amen that will get our attention amen you know what it is that grabs your attention more amen in your life we all have things that grab our attention and it's very easy this is an hour amen we're everywhere you look amen there's attention grabbing amen you go down the road there's attention grabbers amen but it's called marketing amen they market to you heavily when you're watching a video there's attention grabbers right there amen when you're doing whatever you're doing you're just looking through the email amen even in email now there's attention grabbers amen but that one thing amen that is getting the is getting your attention amen what if it's more than god amen then that's the thing that you're in love with the most that is the thing that that has grabbed your attention the most amen whatever it may be amen it could be it could be a video games it could be a a a business that you have or it could be a the tv that you have in your house it could be amen being on the internet constantly 24 7. amen if that takes the place of god in your life amen you're in love with that thing and that has become your god amen praise god and jesus and and david david said here one thing have i desired of the lord amen and that one thing will i seek after amen david amen without the holy ghost to have a desire for god amen that is something great how much more with you and i am with the holy ghost in this hour with the grace of god in this hour amen to have a desire for god amen you are blessed amen you are blessed amen in this hour to be able to to to thirst for god amen and to seek for righteousness and to seek for for uh for justice and to seek amen the things of god you are blessed amen not many people out here feel that way not many people out here don't even know what men they just know that they need to be at church they've went to church they know that there's a bible it's got dust all over it amen they might pick it up amen maybe on mother's day they might pick it up maybe on on on on on easter amen but you are blessed amen if you are in the word day 24 7. now that's not saying amen that you read the word amen sleeping or anything like that amen but the word is in your mind consistently amen that is that is that is wanting to be with god amen david said this one thing amen have i desired of the lord and that will i seek after amen and it reminds me of the of what jesus said amen that you will if you seek you will find knock and it shall be opened unto you amen the problem is is that we don't seek or if we do we seek very very very laxadaisic if that's a word amen what have you lost something important in your life amen something i've lost my wallet amen i've lost uh i've lost different i've lost important things amen i was not i was like well i lost my wallet and it's got to be somewhere i'll see if it comes to me maybe i'll find it in the yellow pages or in a google search i'll find the wallet no i started seeking that thing i started looking for that thing that thing was important that thing had documents amen that i didn't want anybody else to see or get a hold of amen that thing was important to me amen and to david amen being in the presence of god was important amen it was it was important that he said that one thing will i seek after amen to be in the presence of god amen every single time he had the opportunity to to be in that presence amen he was going to be right there amen and if that one thing amen if christ and and god if it's important to you you're going to do whatever it takes to be in that presence you're going to be whatever you're going to do whatever you have to do amen to be in that presence amen because it's important to you amen amen and the thing is is you know if we seek something if we lost something let's say you lost a wedding band or you lost a an important ring or something that that maybe was passed down to your family maybe you you saw after it but maybe you might not find it but you at least you sought it right right amen but the thing is with jesus amen when you seek you are gonna find when you seek with jesus you you will find otherwise he'd make him a liar amen he said seek and you shall find knock and it shall be opened unto you amen and we're wondering amen why is god not in my in my life why i don't see things happening in my life why isn't that things are not taking place in my life are you really seeking the way you should be seeking is that one thing more important to you than amen go and get subway amen at two o'clock or before two o'clock yeah right right oh man we got we got to hurry up and finish service amen because subway amen you know they're waiting for us you know is that more important to you than the presence of god then when the holy spirit is moving in our midst amen the subway ain't going anywhere taco bell's not going anywhere amen but the presence of the lord amen amen he's he's timid amen he's timid and he might that might be your only chance amen to get a hold of god amen if you don't get a hold of god right then amen you might not have another opportunity so so why do we rush these things don't you understand that sometimes we hinder the spirit of god by rushing amen one thing have i desired amen and with jesus christ if you seek you will find right period knock and he shall open unto you this is what he promised but are we doing it with our whole heart well without our heart is it that important to us amen praise god is it important for us amen to really be in the house of god or is it you know just every now and then it's okay every now and then i pick up the bible it's all right every now and then i lift up my hands amen it's okay god amen or are you really seeking that's right because when you seek you will find that's what he said right there's no doubt about it you will find when you see amen praise god i want you to keep that thought in mind amen seek and you shall find knock and it shall be opened unto you this is a simple thought tonight amen but sometimes you know we get into these ruts amen in our lives amen let me tell you what saints i just you know confession is a is is good for the soul amen and during this year amen i've i've i've felt like i've just been i've been in a rut and i got into a point where i just wasn't praying like i should i wasn't meditating like i should i wasn't amen and it's not that i had you know i wanted to go serve the devil and anything like that no no nothing like that amen it's just sometimes you get into this point amen that i've got it figured out and and and you know i understand different things and uh you know god has revealed the word to me and man and then you get laxed and that's a dangerous point to be in saints that is a dangerous point that's the reason why amen i appreciate their ministry that we have here but it can be dangerous to you if you're not careful it can be seriously dangerous because we get so laxed in this hour we get so comfortable a man so comfortable that we lean over to the wall amen and we just fall asleep put that blanket on us amen i already know about daniel 70 weeks i already know these things i've got everything that i need amen we're going to see here the rich young ruler amen in just a moment we're going to talk about him amen you're on dangerous ground when you take that attitude when you come to church saints amen and what happens is that you become critical and you become a man sour and you become a man a wrinkled face amen everything makes you angry everything that everybody does amen or wherever people go amen it makes you upset yeah right amen somebody goes to some youth camp or something like that why are they doing that amen why are they go amen we just become so sour and so amen don't you understand that you hinder your walk with god amen praise god now i was getting like that throughout this year amen now i said and and the other last last wednesday this is just in the form of testimony last thursday i got up and i just really couldn't sleep so i got up already i woke up around 4 4 15 in the morning and i've just had a burden for my children amen i said lord i want you to do something for them and of course what parents would not want amen their for their for god to do something for their kids amen i don't know any parent that you would not want amen for their children to have the holy ghost amen i don't want to have any parent who would not want their children amen to be further their walk with god amen amen i don't know about you that's the case that's what i want amen that's what my parents wanted for me amen and to this day if it wasn't for their prayers if it wasn't for for for them amen sitting down with me and reading the word with me and having devotionals and things like that amen i would not be in the place where i am now they spent that time with me and now amen that all that time they spent amen it's coming amen to fruition amen it will pay off you know parents it will pay off just do it don't it's not brother dale's responsibility or brother wades or brother bob's or brother aaron's or my responsibility to to to to uh uh uh straighten up your children it's your responsibility you're the parent amen if you don't know how to pray find out how to pray amen you're the one who needs to they they are seeking something amen and these are times amen that you've got to be there for them amen brother dale can't do that for you brother dale's got his ministry amen and he can bring forth the word maybe something might touch it amen amen but it's up to you on a daily basis to do that for your children amen praise god i know this ain't what you were looking for but amen this is what you're gonna get so uh you know it's you parents amen you understand that the churches the families are the backbone of a church families are the backbone of the church and if we are not doing with our children amen what we're supposed to be doing we're failing the ministry we're failing the church i got up that morning i said lord i can't sleep i remembered what brother dale would say he said sometimes he'd get up in the mornings at 3 40 in the morning and he'd just start praying you know he just started praying maybe that's what god wanted me to do that morning i started praying and i just got a real burden for my children i said lord save my children father i said lord give them the holy ghost i said father do something for them i said it may take 10 years 15 years i don't know but lord you do something for them and it's my responsibility amen to intervene for my children amen and that day you know i just started feeding on the word and just really just getting it getting in god and i got home that night and i said lord i said i told my family i said we're just going to sit down we're just going to listen to uh watch watch a service we watched one of those services there from from louisiana camp a few months ago a few weeks ago and and we just watched the whole thing and the preaching was wonderful and uh i got up to i think i was using the restroom we were down in the basement and as as the as the uh as the songs were going forth there at the end they were praying for for people and and things like that and i just looked over at the corner and i i and and i saw bella she was right there you know she was just there just crying just crying now that morning i got up and i said lord touch my children she was just right there in that corner just crying i sat back down and i said something told me you better go minister to her during that whole the song service was going on amen they're they're they're preaching amen it was going on we were there bella my wife zoe we just got all together just huddled together and just started praying amen i started praying for her and we just started we had we had church in the basement amen we had church after church amen that's why saints we we cannot be critical of anything else going out here amen just because they are not in here amen doesn't mean that god is not in it amen i don't care what needs to happen amen whether god uses another minister or whether god uses another movement amen whatever whatever will get my children amen to walk closer to god that's what i want amen whatever the bra if the brother believes something different amen i don't care if it's drawing my child if it's drawn me closer to god amen god will handle the doctrine part later amen i want them to be closer to god amen praise god but sometimes we get critical spirits amen and we hinder everybody else around us with our critical spirits i will tell you right now i will not accept critical spirits anymore because because if i would have said well this brother is the one that's preaching i don't understand my daughter would not come something happened to her that night she hasn't been the same since then and i want her to i want that to continue i only say this i don't say this to both i say this to encourage you yo all it took was a prayer amen and god that afternoon did something for my for my for my family amen god changed things god could change situations in your life amen going to uh to the to the camp meetings that we went to last weekend amen it will do something to you when you see your children amen basking in the presence of god jumping and shouting and screaming amen when they've never done that before it'll do something to you amen i'd rather see them be happy in the lord amen than be out there in a pop concert amen doing the same thing and then shooting up drugs afterwards and kissing and hugging and having sex amen i would want that i would want them to do that amen instead of criticizing it amen you better be careful what you criticize you could be you could be blaspheming in the holy spirit and not even know it amen i believe bella had a good time even zoe now they want his like look when is the next meeting when is now they're wanting they want more hey man hey i want i want them to say that to me more than give me an xbox or give me something like that amen praise god that's eternity praise the lord the one thing that i desired most said david amen that's that one thing amen that i'm seeking after amen seek and you shall find amen knock and it shall be opened unto you amen praise god you know we look at the rich young ruler amen he came to jesus and he said lord he said he the bible says that he actually went running to jesus and he said he's and he kneeled to jesus the bible says that means he was really seeking he was really sincere in what he wanted he said if i can have how is it that i can obtain eternal life and jesus amen knowing that he knew all things he starts asking him hey have you kept the commandments i've done this with all my life from my youth he said he wasn't a bad person and maybe he obtained uh some of his riches amen by uh maybe it was an inheritance maybe he was a hard worker and worked hard in his life and obtained those things amen nothing wrong with that he was a blessed man right and now he wanted eternal life because he knew that eternal life could not there was no way to obtain eternal life amen in the current sacrificing of sheep and goats and things like that amen there was a salvation amen but he wanted eternal life and he knew that through jesus christ there was an eternal life amen there was something that he could obtain beyond in what he just had and jesus said did you keep the commandments and he said i've done this from my youth up and you know what jesus says he says one thing one thing that thou lackest amen now it was that one thing that david was sinking after amen it was the one thing that the that the rich young ruler we lacked right and jesus amen went to the root of the problem right yep now let me ask you this amen what is that one thing that is hindering your life you know what it is and god definitely knows what it is is it prayer is it really being sincere about about coming and to church serving god or is it something in your household that's hindering amen what is it only you know and definitely as i said god knows and jesus came into the root of the issue and he said one thing thou lackest amen sell everything that you have and give it to the poor oh my he touched him exactly where he needed to be touched him he got to the root of the problem right amen now i believe jesus knew how he was going to respond now i've picked weeds and things like that out in my yard and and and and things like that and and done yard work and and when you're picking weeds hey man you get you get to some some really stubborn ones sometimes and you can't you can't pull that thing and some of them they just come out nice and easy for the root and everything but some of them they are stubborn amen and you know you're right there and maybe you start by cutting the stalk a little bit kind of getting in the in the leaves a little bit so that you can get closer down to the root that's what jesus was doing when he was asking him have you kept the commandments have you done have you done this that he was cutting down a little bit of that stalk amen cut down a little bit of that of those leaves and things coming down to the root right exposed the root for him and it was up to him amen to do something about that route it was up to it was up to the richer jesus wasn't going to do it for him jesus was not going to do it for you just like he will not do it for you amen there's a part that you've got to do he's exposed it amen sometimes he exposes it through the preaching of the word sometimes he exposes it to a sermon of brother branham sometimes he exposes it through the word amen but you've the one who's got to change he can't do it for you amen and you get to that root amen and sometimes and you know it and it's really thick and it's really uh gross and milky stuff is coming out of it and things like that and you know you're like man i'm already tired i'm gonna leave this thing alone and you watch in a few weeks that thing will be growing back up and probably even bigger than what it was when you first found it amen and jesus got to the root of the issue with the rich young ruler and it was up to him to change that and what does the bible say the bible says that he got sad he got upset jesus was there showing him exactly what he needed to do preaching the gospel to him and he got upset he got so like some of us get sometimes i can't believe he's telling me amen he's up there meddling yeah i like what brother brother uh aaron was talking yet last wednesday man and i said hey if you need the medal if it's the truth meddle away meddle away if it's the truth because if the truth amen the meddling stumps on my toes it makes me change amen i want to keep meddling amen if it's the word keep meddling if you don't like meddling then something's wrong then if meddling is the truth amen it's not meddling it's the truth and jesus christ is truth amen but you see the rich young ruler amen the bible says it says in in uh in mark mark chapter 10 it says and he was sad at that saying and went away grieved for he had great possessions when it's when it's put when it's put before you what you need to do in order to get come to that extra that next step with god and you don't want to do it amen there's a problem with you i just let that marinate in your in your soul you see the solution you know what you got to do and you don't want to do it there's a problem there's a spiritual issue there's something that you don't want to let go or that you're so comfortable either that or your mind is seared i hope that none of us have come to that point that you that your mind is seared that you're so comfortable with just coming to church and being here amen and and that that is a dangerous point to be rich young ruler did not obtain what he came after jesus clearly told him he said one thing thou lackest go thy way sell whatsoever thou has and give to the poor and thou shalt have treasure in heaven amen that's the eternal life that he was seeking after that was the eternal life that he was seeking after he told him how to obtain eternal life and he didn't like it the way it came he thought that he was going to give him a checklist to do all right now you've done the two commandments now you do this and then you do this and then you do this amen or give him some secret formula you know like some of us when we're reading you know these uh motivational speakers and these things like that the secret formula amen to uh to to not fall asleep you know in church or whatever yeah we need to find it yes absolutely the secret formula amen steps one two two and three amen to do this that or the other obtain a million in a year you know and that's what the rich and ruler thought that he was going to give him he gave him something totally different jesus always surprised us jesus always gives us everything totally contrary to what you think is going to be even his birth was that way totally contrary to what the uh the pharisees thought messiah was gonna be totally contrary to what the people thought it was gonna be they read it in the word they saw it in the word and they got it in their mind that it had to be that way but when it came totally different amen they could not receive it that's not the messiah that's not what we read in the bible and it was exactly what they needed now what about you and i saints amen when you there's something in your life amen and god is calling and tugging and pulling at that exact root amen and yeah no that can't be god that can't be god that that's not god amen and he's tugging amen he's pulling amen amen but at one point amen he's exposing but at some point he's going to leave it alone he's not going to deal with you always right bible says that he will not always strive with man he will not always strive with you amen today is the day of salvation the bible doesn't say tomorrow it says today do it while you can right now amen do it while you have the opportunity you got up at four in the morning pray while you have the opportunity it's quiet it's nice and quiet amen have a burden for your children not just have a burden amen so they make it through school and and do extracurricular things and be number one this and that and the other amen to get the holy ghost amen i'd rather get the holy ghost and they'd be homeless all their life amen but they got the holy ghost i'd rather get the holy ghost amen amen i feel i'll feel i would feel happy amen but i know that god will take care of everything else amen when the holy ghost when they put god first amen god will take care of the financials god will take care of everything else amen but when you put work before god young people and when you put school before god when you put extracurricular things before god amen something is wrong with you spiritually there's no there's no doubt about it something is wrong with you spiritually and you need an experience with god amen praise god i promise that i promised i wasn't going to be long tonight amen let's look at uh let's look at another example amen let's look at martha and mary amen i mean you know that story of martha and mary man in luke chapter 10 jesus one day he came to uh to bethany i think is that the place where they were at where they lived and and he came to them and he wanted to come visit lazarus martha and mary amen the bible says that they were his friends so he wanted to go visit them amen he wanted he he might might have not gave him a text message before he got there you know he just stopped by by surprise you know it was a surprise visit you know because he loved them the bible says that he loved him and and they must have loved jesus as well right amen he didn't send them any word amen it was totally different from uh the way jesus reacted amen when simon the pharisee invited him to his home you see jesus doesn't automatically go to somebody's house amen uh uh uh that he doesn't really uh he's not welcomed that amen that's not where he's going to show up but he knew that he would be welcomed here and so he went there amen but it was different with simon thank you man the the the pharisee simon got to send out the invitation come get jesus then jesus went jesus always keeps his invitations jesus always keeps his promises amen it's not like some of us amen sometimes amen well you know i'm not you said i was gonna you know we had an appointment today amen i just sing it five minutes before the appointment i'm not gonna make it jesus is not like that he'll he'll fix everything around him amen he'll he'll get the disciples amen ready to you know you take care of this down the other i got an appointment to go to to see simon the pharisee amen i love him amen praise god so he came to martha and mary's house and martha was there to ready to open the door for him amen she was as soon as jesus jesus oh my what a what a privilege what a what a what a surprise oh my you know what she was ready to receive him amen and she and it's like some of us saints amen you know when we first come to the to the word amen we're excited about this word amen jesus comes into our lives amen we're happy we're excited amen there's nothing that you would not do amen you definitely come early to church you definitely come amen uh to get make sure the tape is playing amen to get the tape you you make sure that you read every morning before you go to work you make sure that you pray every night before you go to bed you do everything that you need to do amen because you're excited about god and unfortunately many of us have lost that excitement now you know if we pray or not it's okay before we go to bed i'm just too tired you read the word of god i'll i'll i'll get it when i come to church wednesday oh yeah that's enough word for me jesus will take whatever you give him but i promise you that's all you'll get whatever you give him right amen martha was excited to see jesus amen and so we know the story jesus walks in amen and martha probably told him sit down let me start making things ready for you hey man she started going in the kitchen and she started cooking amanda the the the eggs and she started frying the bacon she started making the biscuits amen i don't know it might have been breakfast time i don't know hey man she started cooking the hash browns she started cooking maybe she even had some fried okra i don't know you know but she got busy she wanted to serve the lord now a lot of people you know they they see martha as like she's like the the the the bad one you know and that she's martha was not a bad person martha loved jesus martha was so was was so in love with the lord and knew that that was well that was god amen that was just not any other man that was god amen and she knew that that so much that she wanted to serve him amen but that was her problem later we see mary you know she's there cooking you martha martha's there cooking and doing the things and and mary all of a sudden you know starts getting down you know martha's probably thinking hey mary's going to come over here and help me and things but then as she's there cooking and and making the cake putting the turkey in the oven whatever she was doing she looks over the window the little the little window there in the kitchen a man facing the the living room area and she sees mary amen sitting down listening at the feet of jesus amen oh my i wish i was there you know the bible doesn't show what jesus was telling her amen or what he was saying at the moment amen but i wish i was there amen i wish i would have been there you know just listening uh uh and mary was enthralled with with what jesus was saying amen she probably i mean she's like lord i know you're god amen and i got to take this opportunity amen to hear what you have to say and she was there just listening and she was there and jesus was probably there just smiling at her and and saying different things talking you know and and she was just there listen she probably had her mouth open sometimes some of us have our mouth open but with our eyes closed i'm listening but she was enthralled with what and then oh god i can't i can't that i got i got to take advantage of this time i got to tell you oh my oh why are you saying they're what he's saying and then all of a sudden martha comes in here jesus interrupts the whole thing interrupts how sometimes we do amen when the spirit is working jesus it's time to go to subway we got service at two we got this that and the other we got to go amen jesus tell mary to come and help me she probably she probably snapped that neck back into him you better tell him to go and bear tell her go in there and help me and you and the thing is saying says is that martha ma martha was not wrong amen she we need a lot more martha's in in in life amen because sometimes if we don't have martha's in life things don't get done some some of us say man we're so uh so passive about things too uh you know that we're like hippie sometimes yeah whatever happens yeah oh yeah please but martha she knew how to get things done she reminds me brother wade [Laughter] that's a good thing if we didn't have brother wade like that or you know some of these brothers hey man who take action amen some of us will be like when the world's going on around here you know we need them amen but we also need mary's that's right yes we also need mary's mary was right there and martha just interrupted the whole thing and and and and watch what jesus tells us he said lord verse 40 and luke chapter 10 verse 40. but martha was cumbered about much serving and came to him and said lord does thou not care that service is going to start at two o'clock and uh you know and you don't care about that you don't care amen that that my sister has left me to serve alone bit her therefore that she helps me amen in other words you know you tell her and she felt like she was right she was standing right there next to jesus looking down at her and mary was probably like lord i'm in i'm and you watch what jesus says and jesus answered and said unto her martha martha let me tell you what when jesus calls your name twice he's about to say something he's about to say something you know martha martha dark careful and troubled about many things in other words you are so concerned about all these externals that you're forgetting that i'm here right now in other words you're so concerned about about serving me and forgetting to be with me and isn't that how we are sometimes we're so concerned about this that and the other that has to do with god that has to do with with the church and it has to do and we forget that jesus is on the scene we forget to be in his presence we forget to be with jesus in order to serve jesus martha martha dark careful and troubled about many things the turkey's gonna not gonna burn turkey will be fine but one thing is needful that one thing see it's that one thing that's hindering you and hindering me god knows what it is and you know what it is one thing is needful there's only one thing saints amen all those things are fine amen extracurricular things they're fine your business that's fine you need to feed your family your farm whatever it is amen that's all fine but only one thing is needed one thing is needful and mary hath chosen that good part and we shall not be taken away from her right jesus jesus didn't say i'm not gonna take this away from her and jesus didn't rebuke martha either for for for doing what she was doing that was good i'm glad that you are doing that for me praise god but the word takes the preeminence the spirit takes the preeminence amen martha you're encumbered by mechanics amen but you need to be also mindful of the dynamics as well amen martha you're encumbered amen with all these things amen but you need to be a man also mindful of the of the spirit moving amen praise god amen amen brother don you know about mechanics and things like that and some of these brothers they know about mechanics amen and if you you have you can shine and polish mechanics amen but if it doesn't have gas in it and if it doesn't have some form of combustion in order to to fire up the gas to make those mechanics and pistons move and things like that that that car is not worth anything what's the point of having a car that can't run with shiny tires shiny fenders and shiny everything amen brand new 2019 2020 2021 whatever it may be but it can't run i don't need a car like that it just takes up space amen but with god amen with with god amen you need to have him and you want to obtain something from god amen it's not just about the mechanics saints that's why i said amen it could be dangerous amen for you to just be so relaxed i know these things i i've heard them 40 years i i know them and then you don't recognize the moving of the holy spirit right to you you're afraid of it to you you're scared amen to you amen a young person or something like that gets excited about god we talk about the baptists doing that and man some of us we do the exact same thing that's right somebody gets excited about god we don't do that in this church yeah that's the reason why we don't move sometimes because we don't do that in this church we don't do that in this church amen praise god you know whatever environment you put an egg in that's how it's going to hatch you know you put an egg under a cold environment amen it ain't going to hatch you put an egg under a warm and hot environment it'll hatch break out hallelujah praise god amen amen get under the environment of the word and the preaching and the in some shape some shouting and dancing and stuff like that amen that starchy that starchiness will get out of you unless you're just your mind's so seared and so and so that then then god can't do nothing with you so see we need martha's in our life we need mechanics but we also need mary's in our life we need dynamics too god brother branham did not say get rid of the mechanics let's only take dynamics amen no he said let's take dynamics and let's take mechanics both make this thing move amen saints amen amen this one thing amen have i desired amen in my life amen the one thing that matters most amen are are you lacking that in your life amen what is that one thing that is hindering you right amen seek and you shall find look in your life hey we're living in a late hour saints for you to just to just be you know i i i i think about it this way you know our seeing some of our young people hey man zach was just excited there at those meetings hey man she was just jumping around i saw even esther jumping around so kaylee amen zoe amen praising god and crying and crying to god i mean they're literally doing that bella was in it zoe went through the prayer line and she was like what's going on what's going on when she saw me there at the prayer line then she kind of relaxed a little bit you know she didn't know what to do she didn't understand but man it does something to you saying say man to hear or just see young people lay men excited about god like i said earlier i'd rather see him do that than at a pop concert and if that you know i can't help it that you're not like that that's between you and god that's fine i don't know what you're going to do in heaven there's going to be excitement in heaven david david talked about joy you know and even hell there's going to be excitement in hell there's going to be gnashing and win of teeth and things like that people i mean people ain't gonna stay still right i mean people are gonna you know there's gonna be we're avoiding dancing on the coals amen wherever you go there's gonna be excitement but you know a a young a young person let's just take it like this for example a little kid when he's born in life amen he's not still a little baby amen a little a toddler man he's not still he's he's moving and touching and he wants he wants to run on me sister anna a man dealing with little david i mean he just you know just i don't see how they can do it amen i pray for you brother anderson and sister but i'm sure little i'm sure little sarah's helping you guys but they're they're they're they can't stay still that's part of a little kid that's part of a a person that is born again that just come in amen he's excited about god a little young person excited about why would you go down there and try to quench that why would we old that we are older now and and and all we do is maybe worry about you know and argue about the color of the paint and the wall and the color of the paint and the carpet and and all that kind of stuff hey man you you've gone through that already don't quench those that they're going through that in their life let them go through that in their life they need that they need that in their life so that they can at some point grow sit down and listen to the word then gloria then teaching can help them but they have gotten that foundation amen right you see a little kid does not stay you know enacted i mean moving around forever eventually they get to be teenagers eventually they'll get to be adults amen let's be careful to not do that to our young people i beg you amen in the name of the lord amen and that's that that's that's that's the thing that i say that i say i use that example amen so a young person gets excited i get excited even as adults and man we get excited about god amen just step right in it amen start practicing because that's what's going to happen in heaven i don't see us amen just in there amen praise god there's jesus christ the one i've always wanted to see i don't see that saint i don't see that amen so if you don't want to do it then don't get in the way of those that do want to do it don't don't get in the way of those that you want they want to amen praise god brother branham says here amen brothers could put these these quotes hey man we'll end with this now we're too busy talking about other things i think that that's the reason many people who love him watch what he says here that's the reason why many people who love him fail to see him martha loved jesus but she failed to get that part that mary got because she was so encumbered about the the the time and everything it has to be done she failed the good part she felt to get that who love him fail to see him we're so busy with our creeds and denominations and business about the churches and memberships and getting more members and things we're too busy to talk about him you know he's talking to the pentecostals let's just bring it down home you know we're too busy about everything else you know that that we do amen if it gets in the way of god amen something's wrong if it's helped to advance the kingdom of god then praise god amen we're too busy to talk about him he's the word we're too interested in what the some creed some textbook or something else says how many members can we get in vote them in shall we take this one that one the other one we should be constantly giving ourselves to the word of god in prayer studying the word but we're into we're too interested in something else i didn't say that the prophet that you believe that god sent said that and that was 1964 after the seals watch what he says in 1961 he says but day in that day was too busy took up with other things and casting their nets and going back to the fishing talking about the disciples and we are today the same thing this took up with so many different this that and the other and so many isms and so many denominations and so many organizations and the chief presbyter and we got to really watch what kind of a meeting we cooperate with because the district superintendent will turn us out and then if we go down to such in such a meeting the pastor will turn us out and if the oh the bishop will do something to us or the church will excommunicate us oh and we're so busy watching our members to see that they don't go to no other church or have anything else to do but just our little clique i didn't say that he said it we're so busy with that it's just like swapping members one with another and it's just like taking one corpse from one morgue to another just exactly amen what is what is more important to you amen that's right mechanics dynamics because you're wrong too if you're if you just like dynamics no we need them both there's one thing amen the one thing that matters the most and that is god don't put nothing else in your life don't let busyness get in your way [Applause] i've i have i have decided amen this year amen i want uh i don't want to start the rest i don't want the rest of the year to go the way i started right amen that's right i want it to be different yeah i've proven amen that 30 minutes in prayer did something that same day amen what could prayer every single day of your life do for you and for the ones around you amen now i'm not saying you know that that i want i want that experience that bella had ain't meant to continue i don't want her to just amen to just uh be uh you know incline herself to just that and that's it man it's a great you gotta to grow amen you got to grow you pray for her pray for her she's thinking about getting re-baptized and things like that amen you pray for her amen but hey he's got to start somewhere amen and and you know sometimes oh if you know i had an aunt one time tell me uh uh in in greenville south carolina and she said if you could just talk to my son you know if you could just tell him you know because i was already serving the lord at the time i was my early 20s and if you could just tell them you know how what it is you know just got to see if you can get them straight i just blank told her i don't care if she was my aunt i don't care if i said you got to get straight you straighten your life first and then he can maybe see an example in you but we want somebody else to straighten our kids and we don't want to straighten ourselves oh you don't like to hear that but it's the truth anyhow you take that medal the way you want to it's the truth it all starts with you parents it all starts with the head amen brother dale you know he he's here amen he's got to be the example to the rest of us he's a pastor here he's a church he's a head here man if he's not doing right amen people are looking to him amen and seeing his example the way the way the pastor goes is the west where the congregation goes amen pray for your pastor pray for the ministers amen pray for those in charge amen amen let's live this thing out different let's seek that thing that matters the most amen let's stand to our feet praise god amen let's have the musicians come let's just sing the song amen hi we'll praise the lord i don't know what key we're in oh i will praise the lord no

about god amen i suggest amen you seek him you need to seek him amen get prayer do whatever it needs to take amen praise god our sister our sister has a testimony amen if you want to come up sister amen please do continue to remember sister freda's son in prayer amen as he's going through radiation and things amen and just having side effects and i'm sure his mind battles the galore for sister freda amen but most importantly man pray for her for her soul for his soul amen that god would just get a hold of that amen even even even if if the if the body doesn't get healed amen which we believe that he will but if god doesn't that's not his his his uh his his desire for him amen that he gets that soul saved amen that's what we desire amen praise god that's what matters the most amen our sister all right thank the lord jesus i was downstairs so um i was listening thank you for that message brother um i got a real live testimony of miriam martha actually and um i was the martha in this case um i just moved down from baltimore about 10 months ago last year memorial day is when i got down here and so um me and my son move with my dad for a minute and we're still there so um and naturally i'm used to being busy that's how my mom was so i'm used to being busy household stuff just busy cooking cleaning you know the woman kind of stuff and um so my dad is more of the laid-back type like mets don't bother him it doesn't bother him of stuff everywhere he just that's how he is he a man you know [Laughter] so being there for 10 months i'm not really um we didn't grow up close so when him and my mother were together they were my mother did most everything in the house so i didn't really know my dad to do anything so i was used to things the way it was my mom kept everything clean cooked everything so um me being with my dad now i was actually just now getting to see him in the light without they're not together anymore so now i'm getting to see my dad the way he is without my mom around anymore so it was completely different and uh so it was a battle for me though it was a real battle for me to uh be there and him not really helping so i was doing everything i was busy breakfast lunch dinner of course you got to do that because you got a child but you know doing it for him too it started to bother me like dad you need to do the dishes or something you know clean up after yourself dude you know it was getting to me was getting to me so after 10 months i mean i was talking to the lord about it i was like god you know i don't want you know i'm not too used to them we didn't grow up with a our communication being too strong so i'm not the type to sit down dad let me tell you exactly what you need to do okay so it's more like i'll take it take it take it or you know your eat back here take this in the kitchen i'm like dad i just did everything can you just you know maybe get up put you on you know that's how i felt inside just to be honest so i was praying praying because i don't want it on me i don't want that my spirit to be bothered and disturbed so after 10 months it just kind of take a toll on you so this is what um the lord gave me an answer one day and um my dad he definitely listened to his messages he plays brother branham every day he relax he chills he's older now so he's more relaxed he plays his messages all the time praise the lord but this is what god showed me after a while after all the praying everything he showed me that i was martha and my dad is doing the necessary one necessary thing and when that came to me i was like wow i'm the one that needs to chill god showed me myself instead of my dad he showed me what my dad was doing was necessary and i was like wow i got to take a chill so two day you know i started to relax stop doing the dishes all the time everything don't need to be done and i started spending more time with the lord instead like you know so that's funny how you brought that up lord so thank the lord for that um but this is a testimony that happened um sunday when i was here and um isaac was with me and he ended up having a game he played sports he's very good at it that's that's one of his gifts he's very athletic um but anyway they end up having a game that sunday and um he was asking me if he if we can leave church to go and i was like well i don't know about that depends on what time we get out so um he was bugging me about it all throughout the whole service and i was just like isaac we're putting god first we're not i'm not leaving here to go to no game or anything like that it's just gonna have to you know if we don't get out in time it's just not gonna work so um during the break um before second service um he was still nagging me about it you know mom can we make it can we go can we go like i said no we're not going we're not going i said um you're just gonna look we got to put god first sports gonna have to wait and i mean he was just really getting a nerve about it so um i told him the um testimony about brother branham and how god ended up holding the plane for him that time when he went to go meet up with that lady i know some of y'all know the story already but how god held that plane for him and i was trying to encourage isaac to say you never know what god can do if you put him first you never know what he can do if you put him first amen so isaac was still discouraged he's not going to do that for me you know i said well you never know he can do it or he cannot do it but he can do it if you put him first you'll be surprised so um he was still kind of discouraged being this maid and just uh me and t.c and the family went to the park on the break of the church during that break period we just went out they had a good time fellowship ate and everything isaac kind of sat around the van and uh didn't want to come out or anything but finally he came out and ate and kind of still still bugging me about it so uh when we came back to service and everything um the game started at 4 20 but we were still in service so my mind was already dismissed from it like i know that's not gonna work so i'm not gonna worry about it um but he was still bugging me about it he was looking at his watching church falling asleep i'm up here you know it was i was gonna know it but um when we left service um i was like well i think you never know you might still make it so we it take an hour for us to get home but i was like you never know we might can still make it you never know no we ain't gonna make it it's over i don't care no more so i'm like okay well i'm not gonna worry about it so we get we get back and i just kind of laid back in my van for a minute he got out next thing i know isaac come out the house with his face all lit up mom the game don't start at 6 30 ah having another game i just had to rejoice god in that moment because i knew i meant it was god all the way trying to show isaac something that if we put him first he can he can work out anything right and even something that god knew he cared about that but god i believe god was really trying to show him isaac he put me first and that goes for all of us and myself put him first he can work everything else out everything else out and um another message is in that period of us waiting on anything and we just can enjoy our life in the midst of all that because isaac could have enjoyed his whole day if he knew god was going to work that out at the end but that's how i do sometimes i'll be all worried up and worked up and then when things worked out i looked back like man i could enjoy my the rest of my day but the devil will take what we give him he'll take that joy he'll take our emotions we can't give it to him just enjoy god and rejoice praise the lord amen jesus said seek ye first the kingdom of god put god first amen do that be that mary amen i'm here to just take everything in amen everything else secondary god will move on the scene praise god amen all hearts and minds clear brother dale um all right so i think we we got sunday school it starts this sunday right now yeah all the sunday schools remember all of them start except for brother wade at 9 45 so all the the kids amen and again it was mentioned that if you don't know where you need to put your young child or whatever talk to sister monica sister uh sister anna uh or the boyd and ray rachel's she's still traveling she's out west right now but right now it'll be sister lisa sister lisa out in the back so amen and it'd be nice it's nice that we're
