[13:11] Romans 8.
[13:13] the heavenly father we thank you for all
[13:16] things and we know and realize that
[13:19] you give them to us freely
[13:22] so all we got to do is just accept it
[13:24] and say thank you
[13:26] and father then we as the Bride of Jesus
[13:28] Christ cry out for that

[13:46] thank you and truly our hearts go out
[13:49] for the little ones like that and just
[13:52] make everything to be whole
[13:53] and be right because we believe you and
[13:56] Lord we ask you now to be with us in the
[13:58] service tonight and just speak to our
[14:00] hearts and may Lord we
[14:03] Look to You the author and finisher of
[14:05] our faith and believing that thou art
[14:07] God and you change not
[14:09] so then we can depend upon what you say
[14:12] unto us we love you and we thank you
[14:14] forgive our sins cleanse us of all
[14:16] unrighteousness and guide us in Jesus
[14:18] name
[14:19] amen
[14:21] Romans 8 28.
[14:27] and we know that all things work
[14:29] together for good to them that love God
[14:31] to them who are thee called according to
[14:33] his purpose
[14:35] to whom he did for not for whom he did
[14:39] for no
[14:40] he also did predestinate to be conformed
[14:43] to the image of his son that he might be
[14:46] the firstborn among many brethren
[14:48] moreover whom he did predestinate then
[14:52] he also called in whom he called them he
[14:55] also justified in whom he justified them
[14:57] he also glorified
[14:59] what shall we then say to these things
[15:03] what could be said to all of that
[15:05] wonderful wonderful statement if God be
[15:07] for us
[15:09] who can be against us he may be seated
[15:11] the Lord had his Blessing to the reading
[15:13] of the word
[15:14] I hope you've enjoyed the time that you
[15:17] had to hear these other brothers
[15:19] preaching and and everything and enjoyed
[15:23] the fellowship with him we pray that you
[15:26] know that it would open our eyes and we
[15:28] may see the Lord moving Among Us now
[15:31] we've been for some time speaking about
[15:34] the thought of
[15:37] how does God predestinate
[15:41] and we've been kind of you know off for
[15:44] a while on the thinking so we'll just
[15:45] let's just review a little bit and come
[15:48] up to the talk tonight and just move on
[15:50] in the the word and just gradually
[15:53] progress him you know further and
[15:56] further into the the message of what we
[15:58] believe
[16:00] can we see that God
[16:04] predestinates by his foreknowledge
[16:08] not by his desires
[16:11] because he desired it all be saved
[16:13] sure now we're going to get in tonight
[16:15] in going on back into the the back part
[16:19] of of God's mind is the prophet would
[16:21] speak of
[16:22] and all but let's just make sure we get
[16:25] into the right place because see if we
[16:28] just we take something and we take a
[16:30] quote we take and say well these quotes
[16:32] here we believe this and the prophet
[16:35] said this well all right amen he said
[16:38] those things
[16:39] but now does it line up all the way
[16:42] through to where we can keep a thought
[16:44] or have an understanding or you know
[16:47] about something and and all like that
[16:49] because that's the only way that I can
[16:51] go is to follow something and just see
[16:54] it full unfold and unfold if it stops
[16:57] unfolding then I've got a problem
[17:00] because I know and realize that it's not
[17:03] from God
[17:04] so then you know I believe over the
[17:06] years that he has been doing that for us
[17:09] here to unfold his word down through
[17:12] time to where we could could follow it
[17:14] and I certainly appreciate that but now
[17:18] God desired that all would be saved
[17:22] right
[17:23] amen now so then we say yeah but you
[17:26] don't understand brother Dale you don't
[17:28] understand predestination in God and his
[17:31] ways of doing oh maybe I don't but I'm
[17:35] trying and and uh I'm trying to keep a
[17:39] lineup that that I don't have to change
[17:43] as I go along you know or say well
[17:46] that's a little wrong here so I got a
[17:48] line up here you know and I'll uh I'm
[17:51] just trying to move on progressively in
[17:54] the message of the hour that we can see
[17:57] all right then if we can see truly who
[18:00] we are and what we are then by taking
[18:03] the prophet's message we don't have to
[18:05] deny any quotes he says
[18:07] we can believe it all right we can
[18:10] accept it you know and we can go on with
[18:12] with understanding and
[18:14] and that way then something the prophet
[18:17] would say won't be a uh discouragement
[18:21] because we already have the answers to
[18:23] you know what those things are and we
[18:26] believe it see now if you approach to me
[18:28] I've tried to explain it to you it's the
[18:31] way I see it if you approach
[18:33] predestination
[18:35] by not going by foreknowledge first
[18:39] then you're predetermining something
[18:43] and God doesn't do his ways like that he
[18:47] created us
[18:49] made us sure
[18:51] and he knew what we do amen but you know
[18:54] then when the prophet would come along
[18:55] and say you always was eternal
[18:59] right well then just find out what he's
[19:01] talking about right amen I mean that's
[19:04] the easiest way you know we can make a
[19:06] lot of emphasis about big fancy quotes
[19:09] and and saying things you know but will
[19:13] it keep lining up right or are we
[19:16] constantly having to uh correct the
[19:20] prophet you know
[19:22] and all to make it fit our thoughts you
[19:25] know are are saying he corrected himself
[19:28] when we can't find the correction that
[19:30] we just change over you know and go on
[19:33] but
[19:34] see that way if we approach it by
[19:36] foreknowledge
[19:38] then we don't have to worry about any
[19:40] quotes that we have they'll line up with
[19:42] that four knowledge stalk
[19:44] because we've been through it where the
[19:46] Prophet said for knowledge
[19:49] the
[19:51] predestination looks back to
[19:53] foreknowledge
[19:56] all right
[19:57] so then four knowledge comes first
[20:00] then
[20:01] predestinating to the destiny followers
[20:04] after foreknowledge amen so then
[20:07] foreknowledge is always first right
[20:10] right is that a way you don't have to
[20:11] worry about what you're talking about
[20:12] you could say Jacob have I loved and he
[20:14] saw have I hated even before they were
[20:17] ever born
[20:19] that God would know what they were going
[20:21] to do
[20:22] and that he could predestinate
[20:24] accordingly
[20:26] see that it wouldn't be him making the
[20:29] predestination
[20:31] is we make our own predestination
[20:36] we determine our own predestination
[20:38] because he gave us a choice
[20:42] of course if it's like I told you
[20:44] there's people in the message that
[20:46] believes the bride don't have a choice
[20:49] she just stamped and that's it sealed
[20:52] and is over with and don't even need
[20:54] nothing and don't even need Jesus to
[20:56] come and die for us because we always
[20:58] was eternal
[21:00] well
[21:01] I just don't believe it anyway I'm
[21:05] honest and you know and and all but I
[21:08] want to I want to see the truth of it
[21:10] all right
[21:12] and we went over it and over it how that
[21:14] God is infinite
[21:17] and he knows all things before they ever
[21:20] take place
[21:21] if not he's not God what kind of a god
[21:24] do we serve amen
[21:25] amen
[21:27] do we serve an all-knowing infinite God
[21:29] that knew that before the foundation of
[21:32] the world that we would be the way we
[21:34] are are we just serving a god well maybe
[21:37] he does and sometimes he's right and you
[21:40] know no he's infinite
[21:42] all right
[21:43] see then by being that away there's
[21:45] nothing going to be different from what
[21:47] he
[21:49] would be able to
[21:51] have four knowledge off
[21:54] right
[21:56] but now remember one point I tried and
[21:59] we'll read this again in a minute
[22:01] that God cannot make us wrong
[22:05] and judge us for being wrong
[22:10] he can't do that
[22:12] it would be contrary to his infinite
[22:15] wisdom
[22:16] he would be like me and you he would be
[22:18] picking and choosing and and deciding
[22:21] what he wanted and what he didn't want
[22:23] you know
[22:24] right but see it all comes out to The
[22:26] One Thing
[22:28] that he gave us the ability to choose
[22:33] all right
[22:35] and he will not override your free moral
[22:38] agency we went through all of that right
[22:42] let's go ahead and pull up number one
[22:43] and let's read that one
[22:46] because I want these in your mind to
[22:48] think about before we get on over a
[22:50] little further in the message and look
[22:52] what the prophet said
[22:55] this is taken for power transformation
[22:57] of Precinct 65 10 31 in the morning
[23:00] service paragraph 132.
[23:03] he just let them out there on three more
[23:05] agency
[23:07] to let them Act
[23:09] he couldn't make them do it and still be
[23:12] just
[23:15] and what
[23:17] he could put them with put them equal
[23:21] with him
[23:22] all right that's right no
[23:25] and free moral agency
[23:28] and then let them do it themselves
[23:31] and he knew they would do it right
[23:34] so that he gives us a choice a free
[23:37] moral agency
[23:39] and made us equal with him what's what
[23:42] is remember what we were bringing out
[23:43] there's no way as a human mortal we can
[23:46] be equal with God that's that's not the
[23:48] point right right the point is that he
[23:52] gave us the choice and he will not
[23:55] override that choice that's right man
[24:00] see that would make us equal with him
[24:02] not not equal to him trying to be some
[24:04] kind of a great God or his great equal
[24:06] you know like that no no
[24:09] it's the point of giving us a choice
[24:15] right that would make us greater than
[24:18] the animals
[24:20] greater than any other the creation
[24:23] that we can make a choice
[24:27] sure he knew the choice we'd make
[24:30] right
[24:32] I mean he knew that if he doesn't know
[24:34] that he's not an infinite God
[24:39] we'll see if we'd have just took into
[24:40] account a few things down through time
[24:43] mankind wouldn't have been so confused
[24:45] about predestination
[24:49] but I'm talking about the people of this
[24:51] message now not down through organized
[24:53] religion
[24:56] you go around and just
[24:58] to some of the people predestination
[25:01] you know brother Dick's always good
[25:03] about going out when I'll tell you some
[25:05] denomination believes this that or the
[25:07] other you'll go find him one and talk
[25:09] with him well go find you somebody in
[25:12] the message and just get them to explain
[25:14] predestination
[25:17] you'll find mass confusion
[25:21] and they don't deal with four knowledge
[25:23] because see that means if if God is
[25:26] dealing with on the basis and I tried to
[25:28] explain that that if he gave us a choice
[25:33] and by foreknowledge he would know our
[25:35] choice that's no problem because he's
[25:38] infinite
[25:40] but then that would make predest
[25:43] foreknowledge to me is greater than
[25:45] predestination
[25:50] yeah I tried to explain that you know
[25:52] foreknowledge to me means he actually
[25:54] gave me a choice
[25:57] well you just don't understand I agree
[25:59] with you maybe I don't but that's the
[26:01] way I believe it anyway
[26:03] that he gave me a choice
[26:07] and I accepted that choice
[26:10] and by doing that
[26:13] then surely there was a connection
[26:17] in me to eternal life somewhere
[26:20] I can't believe that that's no problem
[26:22] that's what we're going to try to get on
[26:24] to tonight if we can
[26:26] get into that connection that that part
[26:29] that would
[26:30] bring us to a better understanding of
[26:34] life than being
[26:36] but if we approach it any other form
[26:38] then by
[26:41] foreknowledge being first
[26:44] and we gave you that one on
[26:48] go ahead and put up number two words
[26:49] with anybody on the internet they'll see
[26:51] it too
[26:52] this is the power of God 19 and 50. uh
[26:57] five 1006 the word predestinate that's
[27:00] not a good word to use the word
[27:01] foreknowledge is better predestination
[27:04] looks back to foreknowledge and
[27:06] foreknowledge looks to destination
[27:09] all right
[27:10] but God not making set it in order a
[27:14] little hole that you have to go through
[27:16] and can't go no other way
[27:22] but God in order to be God he knowed to
[27:24] end from the beginning so he could
[27:26] predict it and set things in order to
[27:28] happen
[27:30] but see if he if we take it the way
[27:32] we're thinking you know well I always
[27:34] was eternal and I just of all of these
[27:36] great doctrines to see doctrines see we
[27:39] haven't got back in there yet to where
[27:41] we want to on that
[27:43] we talk about all about all of us we say
[27:45] oh this eternal seed
[27:49] I just always was eternal
[27:53] well what are you talking about
[27:57] if that be true then Jesus Christ died
[27:59] in vain
[28:02] because you don't need the death of a
[28:05] savior to draw you to a knowledge
[28:11] you're listening
[28:14] you don't need a savior to draw you to a
[28:16] knowledge
[28:18] you need an opening of your
[28:19] understanding right
[28:22] see you say to somebody said well well
[28:25] you know uh what do you mean you always
[28:27] was eternal Jesus Christ died no no he
[28:30] had to die now that I might be able to
[28:33] understand this
[28:36] you're making a knowledge out of it
[28:38] instead of a birth right
[28:41] right he had to die to release his own
[28:43] life not to release his knowledge all
[28:45] right amen amen
[28:47] amen
[28:49] all right
[28:51] what you see then predestination
[28:54] looks back before knowledge
[28:57] all right so foreknowledge is first
[29:00] right then
[29:04] you come to predestination
[29:07] yeah but brother Dale I was just elect
[29:10] well all right go ahead on number three
[29:11] where people will have that and they can
[29:13] read it and you can read it too
[29:16] adoption in 1960 515 the evening service
[29:20] paragraph 106.
[29:23] listen to this predestination looks back
[29:25] to foreknowledge I mean election
[29:28] I want you election looks back to
[29:31] foreknowledge
[29:34] and predestination looks to Destiny
[29:38] but see that's where people don't want
[29:40] this
[29:41] they don't want this quote
[29:45] they want the other quote where running
[29:46] around them says I never was a pig I
[29:50] never was a dish I never was there
[29:54] I was a true seed all the time well now
[29:56] he's the one that said
[29:58] that we were a couple Bird right
[30:01] all right now you're going to have to
[30:03] tear this one out
[30:06] I don't have to because I know what he's
[30:08] talking about
[30:10] the eternal life that you have by the
[30:13] new birth never was a pig or a hog or a
[30:18] kookaburra
[30:20] we were
[30:22] right
[30:24] what do you think we need to be saved
[30:26] for
[30:27] all right amen
[30:29] come on
[30:32] so he says now election look backs to
[30:34] full knowledge and predestination looks
[30:36] to Destiny
[30:37] don't forget that that election looks
[30:40] back here here it is
[30:42] I was a cuckoo bird
[30:46] don't call me if we got one time you
[30:49] know and I preached about something he
[30:50] said don't call me Serpent seed big boy
[30:54] well I was just quoting behind him but
[30:56] what he'd said
[30:58] you know
[31:00] but the thing of it is see don't call me
[31:03] a kookaburra well the prophet just did
[31:08] so you're gonna have to rip that out
[31:11] so that was one of the things he was
[31:12] wrong about I guess
[31:16] well as he Wellesley brother phone he
[31:19] says
[31:20] he said I was a cucumber I was born in
[31:22] sin saved an iniquity come to the world
[31:23] speaking Life Born amongst Sinners
[31:25] father and mother and all my whole
[31:27] family Sinners I was a kookaburra but
[31:29] all of a sudden I became a wheat grain
[31:31] how did it happen
[31:33] I that what is that election God before
[31:38] the foundation of the world elected that
[31:40] the Kookaburra was to become a grain of
[31:43] wheat
[31:45] now I know I'm a grain of wheat because
[31:48] I'm saved right
[31:51] I know I'm a grain of wheat
[31:53] because I'm saved I know I'm not a hog
[31:57] I know I'm not all of the nature or the
[31:59] ways of the world why because I'm saved
[32:03] all right
[32:04] see then that way you could put it all
[32:06] together and you don't have to deny the
[32:08] things
[32:11] he goes on to say your destiny then it's
[32:13] going to take you where you're going
[32:21] but you do you understand now as we try
[32:23] to go on a little bit tonight
[32:26] do you understand what I've been trying
[32:28] to say
[32:31] I believe you must come into the world
[32:34] or that everybody come into the world
[32:36] lost except Jesus Christ I don't care if
[32:40] you talk about brother Brown who you
[32:41] talk about
[32:42] that's right because he said he had to
[32:43] be born again
[32:46] every person but the Lord Jesus Christ
[32:48] had to be born again
[32:51] person came lost
[32:59] I believe then that you must receive
[33:02] eternal life right amen and to do that
[33:04] you must be justified Sanctified and
[33:08] filled with the Holy Spirit
[33:11] not to just believe on Jesus Christ or
[33:13] believe the message or believe the
[33:15] prophet
[33:17] see that's what everybody says I I know
[33:19] I'm safe because I believe the prophet
[33:20] well the devil does too now does that
[33:22] make himself
[33:30] but you see then I believe that eternal
[33:32] life catches up with us down here
[33:35] amen
[33:38] and I'm going to say this and ain't
[33:39] going to explain no more because I just
[33:42] you know
[33:43] I believe then
[33:45] that there's just one
[33:48] eternal life that's right amen that's
[33:49] right
[33:50] that's Zoe
[33:55] I believe we must receive Brother Ray
[33:57] that eternal life
[33:59] to become a born-again Christian
[34:06] that way I believe that there's only
[34:11] eternal
[34:13] theophany
[34:19] I believe there's just one soul that was
[34:22] created there in Genesis 1 26 and 27.
[34:24] amen
[34:26] amen
[34:28] and I believe that Soul then is your
[34:30] theophany
[34:33] and the prophet explains that a sinner
[34:35] even has a theophany right
[34:40] there's only one maybe two quotes I know
[34:42] there's one
[34:45] because of theophany means a
[34:50] amen
[34:51] that's that's the term or thought
[34:54] body of God
[34:56] all right
[34:57] the sinner has a place to go to when he
[35:00] dies right
[35:02] that's his soul right his soul is going
[35:05] somewhere right amen so he has a body
[35:08] right
[35:11] that's a downward currency
[35:13] he has a body right right he he to go to
[35:17] amen the born-again Christian
[35:21] who has eternal life in their soul
[35:25] then our soul is an upward current
[35:29] in your soul then page 80 of the Hebrew
[35:31] Book your soul is your theophany
[35:36] you know that way you got a body for God
[35:38] to live in
[35:41] all right
[35:42] now he's not satisfied with living in
[35:45] this body
[35:46] although he has to on the basis of where
[35:50] we're at that's why he's trying to
[35:51] change it
[35:52] he was pleased to dwell in Jesus Christ
[35:58] in that body
[36:01] totally pleased with that body
[36:04] that he was living in
[36:06] but he's not totally satisfied with
[36:08] living in our body but yet he's pleased
[36:09] to dwell in US
[36:11] I believe that I believe when you
[36:13] receive eternal life that God is pleased
[36:15] to dwell in you
[36:16] but not please the way that he wants it
[36:22] because he wants us to bring these
[36:24] bodies under subjection to him right
[36:26] amen
[36:28] so then we are a body for God to live in
[36:33] but your soul is your the off in the end
[36:35] that that is the body that where God is
[36:38] living he's not living in your body he's
[36:40] not living in your spirit
[36:42] he's living in your soul by the new
[36:44] birth
[36:46] Soul comes to Soul
[36:49] and that's why he had to give his soul a
[36:51] ransom
[36:53] all right
[36:54] giving his soul a ransom he paid the
[36:57] price
[36:58] he said he sent back to baptism of the
[37:00] Holy Ghost his soul right in the form of
[37:04] that baptism of the Holy Ghost amen
[37:07] to give our soul eternal life right now
[37:10] it's us and God together in there he
[37:12] says
[37:15] one because he come in to make your soul
[37:18] Eternal right now your soul is your your
[37:21] theophany you're going upward
[37:23] where before then we were going downward
[37:26] right
[37:27] we have a place to go to right
[37:30] now
[37:32] and see that either way we can look at
[37:34] eternal life
[37:36] and believe it
[37:40] and see that God did as we're going to
[37:42] read
[37:43] he truly did have a plan and a purpose
[37:45] right
[37:48] right that he was going to achieve
[37:52] that would require
[37:55] that he would have to come into flesh
[38:00] and to die
[38:02] to release that life that was within him
[38:04] amen now the anointing it could be
[38:07] unconscious right and was because he
[38:10] prophesied it was better for one to die
[38:12] for than for the whole nation to suffer
[38:18] but see his soul was lost right
[38:22] that's why I don't believe that any of
[38:24] the Old Testament people had eternal
[38:25] life in their soul that's right amen
[38:28] they had the anointing of the Holy
[38:30] Spirit right
[38:32] right to anoint them right but you had
[38:34] to wait of Calvary where Jesus Christ
[38:36] would come and play the prize and then
[38:38] come and live in US
[38:42] go back to spoken word's original seeds
[38:44] and places like that where the Prophet
[38:46] will talk about that there was 120 of
[38:49] them laying in that Upper Room Little
[38:51] Seeds he called them
[38:53] waiting on
[38:56] eternal life
[38:58] waiting on the return of the promise of
[39:01] the Holy Spirit
[39:05] see then that would be the promise there
[39:06] in the scripture where he says he
[39:08] breathed on them and said receive ye the
[39:10] Holy Ghost they didn't receive it right
[39:11] there your Prophet said that that was a
[39:14] promise
[39:16] amen so then when he said so and so has
[39:19] eternal life just put it where it's
[39:21] supposed to be put it in the category
[39:27] because we're going to find out there is
[39:29] a connection
[39:31] even a foolish virgin
[39:35] will one day receive eternal life you
[39:38] agree right that's right at the white
[39:40] throne
[39:41] you know as far as God is concerned
[39:43] they're already have it
[39:48] as far as he's concerned right
[39:51] but yet they haven't received it yet
[39:54] as far as he's concerned the field
[39:56] sealed you is already sealed in
[39:59] they don't hand it yet
[40:03] you see that's where I believe that we
[40:05] we are we come into the world
[40:09] and God then by foreknowledge
[40:14] knowledge before
[40:17] that he could look down and see who
[40:20] would accept it and who would not right
[40:23] and he could write her name in the
[40:25] lounge book of life before the
[40:26] foundation of the world
[40:27] or he could leave it out
[40:30] because he would know what choice we
[40:32] would make
[40:36] see maybe you don't follow it I know I
[40:38] know everybody don't follow the way I
[40:40] think and I'm proud of that going to be
[40:42] a bad world
[40:45] see then by looking at foreknowledge
[40:48] I see that my choice had something to do
[40:51] with it right
[40:54] that's why I gave you the quote there
[40:56] one day that he said about David he said
[40:58] David I know your desires
[41:02] David desired to build God a house
[41:08] when God said you can't do it
[41:12] David didn't get all puffed up Madden
[41:14] and all we're good with blessed God you
[41:17] know
[41:18] no
[41:19] he said okay
[41:21] I accept my part because I lived it
[41:26] I don't blame anybody else for my life
[41:28] right right amen I lived my life what do
[41:31] you do
[41:33] well people don't like me because the
[41:35] way I live well then you lived it
[41:40] if you live different they might not
[41:42] they would probably like you better
[41:46] I know that's hateful but it's truth
[41:51] but you see then he could look down and
[41:53] see my choice
[41:54] mm-hmm
[41:58] and then he could make sure there was a
[42:01] price paid amen
[42:05] amen come on he couldn't be a savior
[42:08] he couldn't be a Healer unless somebody
[42:10] was lost or something right right
[42:12] exactly right
[42:14] well then we
[42:16] are helping him fulfill his plan amen
[42:23] we are the part that was lost
[42:29] but if it's all predestination
[42:33] predetermining then you wasn't lost
[42:37] do you understand
[42:40] if it just totally stamped predestinated
[42:43] for the world you was it you was there
[42:45] that done
[42:47] There's No Redemption in that how could
[42:49] you display him as a savior or how could
[42:51] you display him as a Healer
[42:54] right
[42:57] he wouldn't be a savior
[43:00] he'd be a maker of us wrong
[43:03] in the killing of those that he wanted
[43:05] to right
[43:08] come on
[43:11] what you think about it
[43:14] that one day God just crossed my path
[43:19] and when he did I was never the right
[43:20] from then on
[43:26] no problem
[43:31] when I saw God at 11 years old there was
[43:33] never no satisfaction in this man's
[43:36] heart
[43:37] until he found that God
[43:41] maybe you it was a different age or
[43:43] older or whatever
[43:46] but if you're born again today then you
[43:48] met God somewhere
[43:50] you made a choice somewhere
[43:52] something happened to you somewhere
[43:57] but you see I just never was satisfied
[44:00] and I'm not today because of what I saw
[44:09] but yet
[44:11] we want to make it as to something else
[44:13] and I know the Bible says
[44:16] salvations of the Lord Jonah 2 and 9.
[44:18] that's wonderful that's exactly right
[44:21] why because I was lost
[44:27] and he saved me
[44:28] it's never been him
[44:31] but I still had to accept it
[44:34] amen I had the choice of whether to
[44:38] accept it or not right amen
[44:42] all right by doing that
[44:45] Tim
[44:46] it's not making me as a part to do with
[44:48] my salvation no
[44:52] it's making me with accepting the pardon
[44:55] that he gave to me
[44:57] hmm
[45:00] but I did have to accept it
[45:02] why because I'm a free moral agent
[45:09] like I said you know people who say well
[45:11] I don't want that whosoever will I want
[45:14] that bride I'm bride don't talk about
[45:16] whosoever will to me well
[45:22] I'm glad it says that because there's a
[45:24] whole lot of Samuel Dales in the world
[45:26] and if my name was even written down
[45:28] somewhere
[45:29] you know Samuel Dale was written in
[45:31] heaven
[45:32] which one of the Samuels you're talking
[45:34] about
[45:39] but see when I when it says whosoever
[45:41] will let him come
[45:44] it gives us a not a part to do with
[45:46] being saved but a part to do with
[45:48] receiving Jesus Christ and then I know
[45:51] that I've talked to you this and surely
[45:52] you're going to remember
[45:54] once that baby is born
[45:57] that baby cries and desires and Longs
[46:00] for
[46:02] food to eat
[46:06] you don't have to wake it up
[46:08] it'll wake us up with watching a little
[46:11] old cash today just fresh born
[46:14] and it's so amazing
[46:16] a fresh born cash just minutes after it
[46:20] was burnt
[46:21] it's stumbling and all trying to get up
[46:24] and trying to do and and everything
[46:28] and you just sit there and look at it
[46:29] and just cry because seeing that how God
[46:32] can lead them
[46:34] right and sometimes if that cash doesn't
[46:36] work exactly right that Mom will get
[46:38] nose to nose with that cash and just
[46:40] start backing up
[46:44] is making the cake walk
[46:48] you know after a little bit
[46:50] that cash starts hunting for something
[46:55] and it may start like that one did today
[46:58] three or four times at the front and
[47:00] trying to find some
[47:04] smell all
[47:08] and even started punching up under it
[47:11] where did it learn that thing from you
[47:13] know when a calf when it yep when they
[47:15] start nursing they'll just start bumping
[47:17] the mama you know come on give me some
[47:19] more meow
[47:22] and finally that little guy found that
[47:24] place
[47:28] if God could do that for a cave what can
[47:30] he do for it
[47:31] a child of God
[47:34] but you know that little cave
[47:36] had to get up
[47:38] that little calf had to move around that
[47:41] little calf had to find its way that
[47:43] little calf had to start nursing
[47:46] but you see the way people preach
[47:48] salvation in this message you they
[47:51] preach it at a point of you not having
[47:52] anything to do with it
[47:55] oh the Lord done this and the Lord done
[47:58] that
[48:00] I don't blame him for everything I've
[48:02] done I don't even blame the devil for
[48:05] everything I've done
[48:06] maybe you do but I know what caused the
[48:09] fall but I know what I volunteered for
[48:12] too all right amen
[48:15] I know I had a choice for not having to
[48:17] do them things
[48:21] but are you listening
[48:23] I'm trying to just get a point then
[48:25] we'll just read a little bit and make a
[48:26] few comments about something I want you
[48:29] to see but I want you to understand
[48:34] what I believe if nothing else
[48:38] I believe God set back there
[48:43] and by his foreknowledge not by his
[48:46] predetermining right
[48:48] by his foreknowledge he saw time
[48:51] and he saw every person that ever come
[48:53] into the world and whether or not they'd
[48:55] want to be saved right
[48:59] I've explained to you how I believe as a
[49:01] human or so wonderful the prophet would
[49:03] say that even that Heathen said he'd be
[49:07] judged according to his own laws well I
[49:11] rejoice when I read that because I
[49:13] wondered what's going to happen just to
[49:14] get all them either that don't ever hear
[49:18] yeah I mean are they just wiped out
[49:23] no that's a human being
[49:29] and he judges them according to their
[49:31] own laws or their tribe sometimes
[49:33] that's according to your prophet
[49:36] what a great message we've had to
[49:38] explain eternal life to ever form or
[49:41] talks about it
[49:42] even to something like that to where
[49:44] that a person can never even hear you
[49:46] know how it's taught by organized
[49:48] religion you don't get born again you
[49:50] don't go to heaven
[49:54] foreign
[49:59] what are you thinking about what I'm
[50:00] trying to say
[50:05] I was born a kookaburra
[50:07] right
[50:09] you was born a kirkiver I don't care who
[50:14] is listening or saying you was born a
[50:17] kookaburra brother random was born a
[50:20] cockleberry
[50:22] now don't be that way brother Dale cause
[50:23] we won't put him what he moves out of
[50:25] what you're going to give him salvation
[50:27] without Jesus Christ
[50:29] I don't agree with it
[50:32] well I'm sure glad you know I'm glad
[50:34] that's not all judged on me too
[50:37] I'm tickled to death it is not all
[50:39] judged on my thoughts and my ideas
[50:43] because if I did none of us would have a
[50:45] hoax
[50:46] and that's not sarcastic that's true
[50:53] but you don't realize
[50:56] that God looked down through there
[50:59] he saw Jacob and he knew what Jacob
[51:02] would do
[51:06] they knew what Esau would do
[51:09] exactly
[51:12] and he knew that if he left Esau here
[51:14] for 500 years more he would never change
[51:23] but he knew you would want to be saved
[51:26] so we had it for you when you came
[51:30] what about a savior
[51:34] a redeemer
[51:37] and you and I are displaying his
[51:39] attributes
[51:41] if it wasn't for the carnal mind and the
[51:44] wrong applications I'd like to preach a
[51:46] little bit about you know it was a good
[51:48] thing we failed
[51:52] because we helped God
[51:54] fulfill his desire
[52:01] would you be willing
[52:03] come on
[52:04] would you be willing
[52:07] because your savior wanted to desire for
[52:09] something from you would you be willing
[52:11] to do it
[52:16] amen Paul said he would that I would be
[52:19] a Castaway
[52:21] for his people Israel
[52:24] did he mean that he evidently did
[52:29] but you understand what I'm saying
[52:34] then it's not some picking this and
[52:37] picking that as we'll read in a minute
[52:44] I'll read you one in a minute before you
[52:46] get time
[52:46] I wrote a random I told you before we've
[52:48] read it where he said
[52:50] he said he would Elohim self-existed
[52:53] but it said he'll never be that again
[52:55] you're right
[53:01] it's not justifying our ways of things
[53:04] that to make it turn out to where we
[53:05] could bring a savior I hope your
[53:07] carnality of your mind is not that bad
[53:12] but it's the basis of realizing what
[53:14] we've done
[53:20] you realize he would not be a savior
[53:24] if there wasn't something lost that's
[53:27] right
[53:27] but now get the point
[53:33] being lost don't make him a savior
[53:42] you listening being lost don't make him
[53:45] a savior
[53:46] it's when he saves us amen right amen
[53:49] that's the part we have to do with it
[53:52] Danny is when he saves us
[53:55] then now he's a savior amen
[54:00] to a person that's going to be lost
[54:02] he's not going to be a savior
[54:06] right right
[54:08] he's not going to be a savior to a
[54:11] person that's
[54:12] rejects him and his loss
[54:14] he was there for them if they desired it
[54:17] amen amen right
[54:20] I'm trying to get you to think about
[54:21] your own part
[54:23] because whether you believe it or not
[54:25] the Lord did speak to me something about
[54:27] the Rapture and that right there is
[54:29] where it's tied to and I'm trying my
[54:30] best to explain it
[54:34] that you and I are going to have to find
[54:35] something personal yeah right yeah and
[54:39] get away from just God sent a prophet
[54:41] and we believe it or this we believe
[54:42] that or we believe that this but get
[54:45] down to something personal
[54:48] and if we can't realize we was lost
[54:51] and God come down to save us there's
[54:54] nothing personal about our lives then
[54:58] that's right
[55:00] I'm talking about something that's in
[55:01] your life that he looked down and Saul
[55:04] and he liked it
[55:08] I don't see I could like I don't either
[55:11] I don't see I could like anything in our
[55:13] lives
[55:16] but there was something about you
[55:19] try it
[55:21] he went on top we want to talk about
[55:23] this seed that was in US
[55:25] where do we get all of this thought out
[55:28] before you talk about that you notice I
[55:30] hadn't said anything about it
[55:34] I believe in a predestinated seed
[55:40] I believe in a predestinated
[55:43] Eternal seed
[55:45] those notes are laying on the desk
[55:49] but if we don't approach it this way
[55:50] we'll muddle it up into our thinking
[55:52] right
[55:55] especially we can't find something with
[55:57] our own selves and our own thinking in
[55:59] our lives
[56:01] to put ourselves into the form of
[56:03] salvation
[56:08] he's not a savior for something that's
[56:10] not saved
[56:11] he's not a Healer for somebody that's
[56:14] not healed
[56:22] so then maybe there is something about
[56:24] this that
[56:26] in some way he connects us
[56:32] but it's got to be something personal
[56:35] I've always believed in that I've always
[56:37] believed in first a personal God
[56:40] I do not believe that I serve the same
[56:42] God that brother dick Addison serves
[56:45] it may be the same person maybe the same
[56:48] God may be the same this that or the
[56:49] other but it's not the same God
[56:51] why because he's my God right he's my
[56:54] savior amen
[56:57] you got to have your own personal
[56:59] experience with that savior amen right
[57:04] so that it's not a husband and wife of
[57:06] fire that's right right
[57:09] or sister Gayle she told me when they
[57:12] come up to be baptized she said I'm
[57:14] going to be baptized because my husband
[57:15] wants me to I said I won't baptize you
[57:19] that's what I told her she knows it
[57:21] I said it will not baptize you
[57:25] not just because your husband says you
[57:27] do it I won't do it we talked a little
[57:28] while and I looked over at her I said
[57:30] you're not pulling nothing over on me
[57:32] you see what I'm talking about she said
[57:35] yeah I said okay now we'll do the
[57:36] baptism
[57:40] you see I believe in a personal
[57:41] revelation
[57:43] that's right a personal God
[57:50] that lives with inside of us
[57:55] and that way then we are fulfilling his
[57:57] plans
[58:00] he had a plan and a purpose
[58:05] he knew before the before there would
[58:07] ever even any natural world or anything
[58:09] he knew what he was going to do
[58:11] that's right
[58:12] but he knew that all he had to do was
[58:15] just put us here
[58:16] and we'd fall
[58:20] come on folks don't be so super duper
[58:22] religious thank you
[58:26] God also knows right now you stick your
[58:29] nose in the wrong place you got a
[58:31] problem
[58:34] he don't give you a choice to go running
[58:36] around for those things
[58:37] beware
[58:39] no you'll never be lost
[58:44] not if you're ever saved no
[58:48] I believe in the growth development in
[58:50] growth development in our Christian Life
[58:52] that's right
[58:54] that will bring us to a place that
[58:58] we don't have no other desires but him
[59:05] we all used to in our lives had plans or
[59:08] thoughts in our lives
[59:13] but
[59:14] that ought to be going out of the way
[59:16] now
[59:18] getting to the bases we see what he
[59:20] wants
[59:24] but do you understand that what I've
[59:25] been trying to drive because I want to
[59:26] read something to you and then we'll
[59:28] start from that
[59:29] I believe that you come into the world
[59:31] lost
[59:33] doomed and on the way to hell
[59:37] I was going to title the message not the
[59:40] condescending of God but no I'll have to
[59:42] get back to that on another message and
[59:44] come over
[59:45] but
[59:50] God did come down
[59:53] Amen
[59:54] to die yes
[59:57] oh but brother my God can't die
[1:00:04] I suggest you find a God that can
[1:00:11] all right
[1:00:13] you ever but he's not tangible he's not
[1:00:16] well you know and like I always say I
[1:00:19] know that
[1:00:21] but you know those animal skins that
[1:00:23] came off of those animals
[1:00:25] in the garden for Adam and Eve
[1:00:29] was they removed by a spirit
[1:00:35] you know well God is a spirit
[1:00:38] what did a spirit just come down and
[1:00:40] pull that off
[1:00:43] that makes him bloody
[1:00:46] you thank God for being bloody
[1:00:51] he pulled them skins off them animals
[1:00:53] and put them on Adam and Eve
[1:00:57] but I just can't see God that real why
[1:01:01] after all that we've been through why
[1:01:03] can't you see him as real come on
[1:01:08] you mean you're more real than he is
[1:01:12] but I just never thought about him being
[1:01:14] that real
[1:01:15] well maybe you want to start thinking
[1:01:16] about it
[1:01:19] well it's just a theophany
[1:01:24] well that's the oven is the body of God
[1:01:35] from those animals
[1:01:38] right well okay
[1:01:45] well see we want to lay on the bases the
[1:01:47] people of the message lay on the basis
[1:01:49] with a lot of there's a lot of quotes
[1:01:50] that brother Brown will say
[1:01:54] if you have eternal life
[1:01:57] of course they leave that out
[1:02:00] they don't quote if you have eternal
[1:02:02] life you always was eternal
[1:02:05] they don't want the if there because
[1:02:07] that's a possibility or a question right
[1:02:10] me
[1:02:12] um
[1:02:15] no they want it to be I have eternal
[1:02:17] life I was born with eternal life oh my
[1:02:20] god well then Jesus Christ died in vain
[1:02:22] right that's right
[1:02:28] you had to get it somewhere
[1:02:30] where did you get it well I always had
[1:02:33] it
[1:02:36] well that's predestination then
[1:02:41] that's predetermining
[1:02:44] all things
[1:02:47] and giving no one a choice of nothing
[1:02:55] you follow me
[1:03:01] but do you understand we look back to
[1:03:02] foreknowledge and that way we can follow
[1:03:04] through the scriptures and read and no
[1:03:07] problems
[1:03:09] that those who he foreknew
[1:03:11] he did predestinate
[1:03:18] those who before knew
[1:03:20] he did predestinate
[1:03:24] that's why I made that little drawing go
[1:03:25] ahead brother Anderson and
[1:03:28] pull up that drawing that I made the
[1:03:30] other day and there's a whole lot of
[1:03:32] more things could be put onto there but
[1:03:35] it's just enough to give you an
[1:03:37] understanding
[1:03:40] from where you're looking on this and it
[1:03:42] says mine and if you notice it's split
[1:03:43] in both forms because it has to be
[1:03:47] because if this mind here is not
[1:03:50] according to that mind there then
[1:03:52] you've changed it somewhere
[1:03:54] but then you can look over and you can
[1:03:56] see that even for knowledge
[1:03:58] would bring
[1:04:01] a lamb slain
[1:04:04] your name could be written in the lounge
[1:04:07] Book of Life
[1:04:09] only because
[1:04:12] that he saw the lamb would be slime
[1:04:16] then you can go through election calling
[1:04:18] you can go through the mind of God
[1:04:20] you can go to predestination choosing
[1:04:23] for knowledge for Saul for no Plan of
[1:04:26] Redemption you can go through the cedar
[1:04:28] word
[1:04:32] and still not be in the back part
[1:04:35] of God's mind that we want to talk about
[1:04:39] but you'd be in his mind of what would
[1:04:41] take place and what would be see then we
[1:04:43] come over into time and life and you get
[1:04:45] a free will free more agency Choice
[1:04:48] Destiny and time receiving eternal life
[1:04:51] justification sanctification baptism of
[1:04:53] the Holy Ghost glorified becoming the
[1:04:56] word adoption Redemption completed Cedar
[1:04:59] word whosoever will those are just some
[1:05:01] of the thoughts
[1:05:03] of getting us into a thinking about a
[1:05:06] a dividing
[1:05:11] and it's like I told you over and over
[1:05:13] and we'll keep going over Judas was in
[1:05:15] the mind of God
[1:05:21] so then this just being in the mind of
[1:05:23] God is not the whole key
[1:05:27] everything that would ever be in the
[1:05:28] world is in the mind of God
[1:05:31] they were personal every thing ever
[1:05:33] thought ever Nat everything would be in
[1:05:36] the mind of God
[1:05:41] see then I don't want to just be in his
[1:05:43] mind
[1:05:45] I want to be a part of his mind
[1:05:48] I want to find my place connected with
[1:05:50] him
[1:05:53] because I believe in that
[1:05:58] I believe that eternal life that you
[1:06:00] have Brother Gary is the life of
[1:06:03] almighty God
[1:06:09] and that always was eternal
[1:06:15] I just got to receive it here
[1:06:21] but then by that eternal life is a part
[1:06:25] of God
[1:06:31] look what you probably had to say look
[1:06:33] at we get number four
[1:06:36] Christ's mystery of God reveal
[1:06:39] 63 7 28.
[1:06:45] paragraph 102 103.
[1:06:49] now God's Great secret mystery
[1:06:53] he had before the world began
[1:06:55] now back in the back part of God's mind
[1:06:58] that's the title of the thought of we're
[1:07:00] still on how does he predestinate but
[1:07:03] the thought is what
[1:07:05] back in the back part of God's mind
[1:07:10] now
[1:07:12] there would be no way that anyone could
[1:07:15] uh
[1:07:17] get that thought like that as I tried to
[1:07:19] explain the last message or somewhere
[1:07:21] right in there
[1:07:22] see we think well I have this thought
[1:07:25] and I believe that thought was what God
[1:07:27] had before the world
[1:07:29] does it fit the word
[1:07:32] well I I can't rightly find it in well
[1:07:34] it didn't come from God
[1:07:40] sorry
[1:07:41] were you telling me I can't think
[1:07:44] amen I just told you you can't think
[1:07:49] because that's what he's done right she
[1:07:52] said I thank
[1:07:55] she messed everything up
[1:07:57] but if we can take them do away with our
[1:07:59] thinking and get his mind
[1:08:02] let the mind that was in Samuel oh
[1:08:05] that's not exactly what it says isn't it
[1:08:07] it was the mind that was in Christ being
[1:08:10] you
[1:08:13] amen the mind that was in Christ in the
[1:08:14] very Mind Of God Amen
[1:08:21] back in the back part of God's mind
[1:08:24] there was something that he was trying
[1:08:26] and was going to achieve
[1:08:30] and he had a motive
[1:08:32] in doing it now what was his motive
[1:08:35] in order to let himself be expressed
[1:08:41] thank you because first
[1:08:43] there wasn't even a Moon Star at a
[1:08:46] molecule or anything
[1:08:47] he was God
[1:08:50] we didn't
[1:08:52] actually wasn't God at that time because
[1:08:55] God is an object of worship and there
[1:08:57] was nothing wasn't nothing to worship
[1:08:59] Him
[1:09:01] now we know that he explained in other
[1:09:02] messages the first thing he done is
[1:09:04] created angels that was the first thing
[1:09:07] it wasn't you and me
[1:09:11] the first thing God created was angels
[1:09:14] they worshiped him he became God
[1:09:17] that's where it says in Genesis 1 God in
[1:09:20] the beginning God created heaven and
[1:09:22] earth
[1:09:23] see he had already received the form of
[1:09:25] God by the Angels worshiping him
[1:09:28] but that was not the worship that he
[1:09:31] wanted
[1:09:33] we're the only ones that can worship him
[1:09:35] the way that he desires
[1:09:37] but for to be God he was already gone by
[1:09:40] the Angels
[1:09:44] are you with me do you need those quotes
[1:09:45] you need that dog
[1:09:49] listen
[1:09:50] so in his great mind he wanted these
[1:09:53] attributes
[1:09:55] to be expressed you remember how I
[1:09:57] preached for years on that
[1:09:59] God never gained attributes coming this
[1:10:01] way
[1:10:02] he always had those attributes
[1:10:05] well he wasn't a Healer he wouldn't say
[1:10:07] no that's displaying it right
[1:10:11] that's a displaying the attribute our
[1:10:13] manifestation of the attribute
[1:10:16] he had those attributes in him
[1:10:19] all right so you're looking back there
[1:10:21] and seeing a whole lot more about God
[1:10:22] than we ever thought about what we when
[1:10:24] we had our organizational Minds about
[1:10:26] what God was
[1:10:28] the best we could do would be able to
[1:10:30] come up with a word something of
[1:10:31] self-existing
[1:10:38] but we're going to get down to a point
[1:10:40] to eventually to be able to see It'll be
[1:10:42] Sunday I know now but
[1:10:46] God's thoughts are eternal
[1:10:52] he could never have a new thought
[1:10:55] what a wonderful statement
[1:11:00] but think about it
[1:11:02] he wanted these attributes to be
[1:11:04] expressed and him was love and him was
[1:11:06] to be father and him was to be son and
[1:11:08] him was to be a savior and him was to be
[1:11:11] a Healer and all of these great
[1:11:13] attributes that we see already expressed
[1:11:16] they were in God
[1:11:19] now he never gained him he displayed him
[1:11:22] he never gained him coming this way
[1:11:26] that's why I changed the title of the
[1:11:27] message I was going to go into the
[1:11:29] condescending but I'd rather put it
[1:11:32] the back part of God's mind
[1:11:36] and you think about
[1:11:37] the back part
[1:11:39] of God's mind
[1:11:45] and just comprehend that a little
[1:11:50] the back part
[1:11:53] the only way we can comprehend that or
[1:11:55] even think about it is by way of Amos 3
[1:11:58] and 43-7 where he said I'll do nothing
[1:12:00] but reveal my secrets to my servants the
[1:12:03] prophets well even all of those Prophets
[1:12:06] Paul went into the third dimension you
[1:12:10] know third heaven or whatever not
[1:12:12] Dimension third heaven
[1:12:14] and came back and said I can't even tell
[1:12:16] you
[1:12:18] run around and said I believe I went to
[1:12:19] the first heaven
[1:12:21] he come back told us about it
[1:12:24] right
[1:12:25] Paul
[1:12:28] now you want my understanding of that
[1:12:31] What if Paul had wrote it back there
[1:12:33] what he saw right he wouldn't have been
[1:12:37] no mystery secret left down Through the
[1:12:39] Ages
[1:12:40] and it wouldn't been dependent then upon
[1:12:43] Malachi 4 as to be where all the
[1:12:46] Mysteries would be revealed because Paul
[1:12:48] would have showed us all the Mysteries
[1:12:51] I believe he went to the third heaven I
[1:12:53] believe he saw Jesus Christ as no man
[1:12:58] has ever seen him
[1:13:01] until the end time
[1:13:04] by way of the Prophet then we can go
[1:13:07] back into God's mind
[1:13:09] and comprehend things
[1:13:11] or think about what he could think about
[1:13:15] all right now pull the drawing back up
[1:13:17] and you'll see what I'm talking about
[1:13:18] remember in the back part of God's mind
[1:13:22] there was something that he was going to
[1:13:24] achieve
[1:13:27] it was going to express himself so back
[1:13:31] in here even back as far as you can call
[1:13:33] him self-existing
[1:13:38] and that's why I've always tried to say
[1:13:39] this one little point
[1:13:41] to you
[1:13:43] people keep wanting to go back and go
[1:13:45] back into the mind or go back and and
[1:13:48] great things that they are or what this
[1:13:50] are be careful you might
[1:13:52] take yourself out of existence
[1:13:56] amen
[1:14:01] carnalist my mind is
[1:14:04] I can see
[1:14:05] that anything on that line
[1:14:08] that away
[1:14:10] if that's as far as I go
[1:14:13] in the doctrine that I'm trying to bring
[1:14:17] I could go out of existence
[1:14:21] they mean nothing to you
[1:14:24] but that's the way I see it
[1:14:27] if that's all we see if that's all we
[1:14:29] know
[1:14:30] going that away I'm emphasizing it
[1:14:34] then we could take ourselves out of
[1:14:36] existence
[1:14:45] as they're saying the other day about me
[1:14:46] I'm about to say see
[1:14:48] I don't say C I said c
[1:14:52] hmm
[1:14:53] because I want you to see
[1:14:56] you know
[1:14:58] but if we can come over here
[1:15:01] into the back part of God's mind
[1:15:05] no I'm not a doctor or terminology isn't
[1:15:09] crazy and all like that because I don't
[1:15:11] understand but I do understand that the
[1:15:14] front part of your brain is your
[1:15:16] intelligent part that you're thinking
[1:15:18] with you live here this is the the front
[1:15:21] part is you're knowledgeable existence
[1:15:23] of here
[1:15:24] you know and being life and do it is the
[1:15:28] front part of your mind when you go into
[1:15:30] the back part of your mind the prophet
[1:15:32] explained one time that you go into the
[1:15:34] subconscious
[1:15:35] see because you have out here the
[1:15:38] conscious part of you as you're dealing
[1:15:39] with life
[1:15:41] and and then you go into the
[1:15:43] subconscious
[1:15:45] all right now you took a profit to be
[1:15:46] able to go back into the subconscious
[1:15:48] because remember you and I are we're not
[1:15:51] born with the ability but he was born
[1:15:53] with the ability when the doctors tested
[1:15:55] him that day he said you could dream a
[1:15:57] dream without going to sleep
[1:16:00] they could prove that with their
[1:16:01] machinery
[1:16:02] him
[1:16:04] said your conscious and subconscious is
[1:16:06] right together
[1:16:10] see he could be out here in the mind of
[1:16:12] God and be back here in the mind of God
[1:16:14] this is as far as you and I can go
[1:16:22] I didn't say as far as we'll go
[1:16:26] like you think
[1:16:29] because by way of the prophet
[1:16:33] and without taking our own uh thoughts
[1:16:36] and Concepts or ideas
[1:16:40] would just listen to what he says
[1:16:45] someday we might find us further back
[1:16:48] than
[1:16:49] this line that we're talking about
[1:16:52] I believe in an eternal God
[1:16:57] I believe in the children of God
[1:17:01] the children of God are a part of God
[1:17:06] not a part of Jesus who was a part of
[1:17:08] God
[1:17:11] what a part of God
[1:17:15] if we just keep easing along maybe we'll
[1:17:17] find out a lot of things
[1:17:22] but let's be careful how much we think
[1:17:27] because we don't want to do as the
[1:17:28] others has done to run off with great
[1:17:30] ideas of always was eternal
[1:17:33] now you check this and see if I'm right
[1:17:39] the biggest portion of those people that
[1:17:41] teach
[1:17:42] that I always was eternal
[1:17:45] in the wrong way
[1:17:47] have gone into
[1:17:50] adultery
[1:17:52] physically
[1:17:57] now you want to name some names no I
[1:17:59] won't do it
[1:18:00] don't have to
[1:18:03] just listen to what you hear
[1:18:09] listen to what you're listening to
[1:18:13] you hear these other preachers preach
[1:18:15] well how do they preach eternal life
[1:18:23] they can throw out a lot of clothes
[1:18:26] and you you get so much as kind of like
[1:18:29] some of the brothers done with it in
[1:18:30] that Daniel 70 weeks I never if I went
[1:18:32] the way they believed it I'd be the most
[1:18:34] Mass confused person I've ever seen in
[1:18:36] my life
[1:18:37] because to try their best to disprove
[1:18:39] what Wade and I had taught on they would
[1:18:42] go this way with it and they'd go that
[1:18:43] way with it and one brother he stood
[1:18:46] right here and he had he actually
[1:18:48] preached seven years
[1:18:51] of Jesus's Ministry back under
[1:18:54] three and a half years with Gentile
[1:18:56] under three and a half years with the
[1:18:57] Jews back Yonder
[1:19:00] oh my Lord man you got better sense than
[1:19:03] that
[1:19:04] but I reckon he didn't
[1:19:06] not just honest
[1:19:10] but you see we get a thought
[1:19:14] and like one brother he said I set up
[1:19:16] for three or four days weapon a night
[1:19:18] four in the morning
[1:19:19] to get this that I've got well he I'm
[1:19:21] honest I'm sorry he'd been better off
[1:19:23] his lab
[1:19:26] I'm honest
[1:19:27] sorry
[1:19:29] that don't make me nothing but the truth
[1:19:31] will stand amen
[1:19:34] amen
[1:19:35] just keep moving along real slow
[1:19:39] let's talk a little bit about this
[1:19:42] part of him dwelling alone
[1:19:49] let's go back to that back part of God's
[1:19:52] mind
[1:19:53] and think about him dwelling alone
[1:19:57] and remember the prophet will explain
[1:19:59] that that is back before atoms or
[1:20:02] molecules or anything that we speak of
[1:20:07] you got to go from them back past all of
[1:20:09] anything you can think of as being
[1:20:12] in existence you've got to bypass that
[1:20:14] and go all the way back
[1:20:19] and to think about the mind
[1:20:25] mankind has been able to take the mind
[1:20:30] and do marvelous things
[1:20:33] why the Bible said you got to put them
[1:20:34] out he said because nothing is
[1:20:37] withholding from the imagination of
[1:20:39] man's mind
[1:20:42] look at them now
[1:20:46] this message is striking
[1:20:50] the Philippines exactly 12 hours because
[1:20:52] we're talking about the other day
[1:20:56] but you know what
[1:20:57] it's live right there
[1:21:03] 12 hours difference in time
[1:21:06] but yet it's live
[1:21:09] you explain that
[1:21:14] explain all of the mechanical things
[1:21:16] that they have been able to come up with
[1:21:17] because of the human mind
[1:21:22] the Bible says nothing's withholding
[1:21:24] from
[1:21:25] the prophet of God said it like this one
[1:21:27] day he said man has broken into God's
[1:21:32] laboratory amen you remember that one
[1:21:37] broken into God's Laboratory
[1:21:46] with the mind you can actually there's
[1:21:49] people that can actually Bend metal
[1:21:53] with their mind
[1:21:56] it's all that's foolishness no it's not
[1:22:02] with the mind
[1:22:07] you know that they're teaching them now
[1:22:09] and I'm sure they're Way Beyond that
[1:22:10] because once they tell you they're doing
[1:22:12] something they're already above that
[1:22:14] right but it was yours this had been 10
[1:22:16] years ago I guess or more
[1:22:18] that they were talking about an airplane
[1:22:21] and connected into your brain
[1:22:25] and flying that airplane by your brain
[1:22:29] because see if you're flying like this
[1:22:32] and an enemy comes in over here or bombs
[1:22:34] coming your way it takes a split second
[1:22:37] for you to make that connection between
[1:22:39] the hand and the eye and the
[1:22:41] coordination
[1:22:42] and they've been teaching that for for
[1:22:44] 10 years or more
[1:22:46] to hook it up to your brain and fly by
[1:22:49] it
[1:22:51] because see in that way everywhere you
[1:22:53] look is where the plane would go
[1:23:01] the mind of man
[1:23:07] but then my Bible says what
[1:23:11] God's thoughts
[1:23:13] are higher than your thoughts
[1:23:16] God's ways are higher than our ways so
[1:23:20] whatever they can do
[1:23:23] did you read in the paper the other day
[1:23:27] or that they are now releasing
[1:23:30] a section of land out there or telling
[1:23:33] you about it it exists
[1:23:35] track 51 I believe it is
[1:23:38] that do you read it some are shaking
[1:23:40] their head yes and you know what they're
[1:23:43] dealing with and they've been dealing
[1:23:44] with was UFOs
[1:23:48] Stouts bombers
[1:23:51] millions of acres of land that no one is
[1:23:54] allowed to go in
[1:24:01] we're just seeing the trash cans of what
[1:24:03] the world knows about
[1:24:05] that the mind has been able to do it was
[1:24:08] in the paper the other day about it's
[1:24:10] coming up to a certain time that Francis
[1:24:11] Powers remember the U2 pilot was shot
[1:24:13] down I believe in 62 over Russia
[1:24:17] evidently must have been a lucky shot
[1:24:19] because
[1:24:20] that plane was more sophisticated than
[1:24:24] those stelks bombers that went into
[1:24:26] Kuwait back 10 years ago
[1:24:34] what we talk about now on these military
[1:24:37] guys can tell you that's that's junk
[1:24:39] pile stuff
[1:24:41] told you they had a watch a watch entire
[1:24:45] in the year 1900
[1:24:48] that could take pictures
[1:24:53] we life about get smart and the guy that
[1:24:56] had the telephone in his shoe you know
[1:24:58] and all of the things
[1:25:03] he used to go to the old Buck Rogers
[1:25:05] movies and they had raygons and
[1:25:06] interplanatory travel and the ability to
[1:25:09] do all kind of and they've got it now
[1:25:14] because of the mind of man
[1:25:23] but yet God's thoughts are higher than
[1:25:25] our thoughts
[1:25:27] to go back into the mind of God is not
[1:25:29] to get a spaceship and try to fly
[1:25:31] backwards
[1:25:34] we used to read about time machines warp
[1:25:37] machines
[1:25:40] wonder how much they're doing on it
[1:25:44] oh that can't be done well if you can
[1:25:46] fly from here there and get there before
[1:25:48] you start here
[1:25:50] that's pretty close
[1:25:54] right I know that's hours difference I
[1:25:57] know what you're talking about
[1:25:59] but I also know that what would happen
[1:26:01] if you proved too fast
[1:26:05] they go so fast and you break through a
[1:26:07] sound barrier and there's no limits to
[1:26:10] the plane
[1:26:13] the mind of man
[1:26:19] but to be able to go back by way of a
[1:26:21] prophet
[1:26:23] into the mind of God
[1:26:25] where all of these things we see
[1:26:30] come from because of that
[1:26:37] you say well you believe in UFO no don't
[1:26:39] believe in UFOs I've done told you over
[1:26:41] and over don't believe in UFOs I believe
[1:26:43] in inter-terrestrial beings not
[1:26:45] extraterrestrial that might not be the
[1:26:47] way to explain it to pronounce the word
[1:26:49] but it gets the point across
[1:26:54] brother random said in 1955 said Russia
[1:26:57] had flying saucers jet airplanes and
[1:26:59] flying saucers we knew they had had
[1:27:01] airplanes because they've captured them
[1:27:04] from the Germans
[1:27:06] he said they had flying saucers
[1:27:13] what a wonderful thing to be able to
[1:27:15] think about by way of a prophet
[1:27:20] you see why I love this message why I
[1:27:22] believe it
[1:27:24] why I hate to see people that want to
[1:27:26] say he was wrong here and he was wrong
[1:27:28] there
[1:27:31] I'd like to see that person go tell
[1:27:33] Einstein how to make atomic bomb
[1:27:39] that's as dumb as you could think about
[1:27:42] well I know how to work up from wires
[1:27:44] and put you over here to make that
[1:27:45] switch work turn this light on
[1:27:47] I won't talk to you because I think I
[1:27:50] could help you
[1:27:53] yeah
[1:27:55] but we can't help God either
[1:27:57] but by listening to a prophet as he
[1:28:00] explains things
[1:28:02] we can be able to get a picture of what
[1:28:05] that is
[1:28:06] right
[1:28:08] you with me
[1:28:10] look at number five and what he says
[1:28:17] this is taken from the message does God
[1:28:18] change his mind
[1:28:20] recent 1965 427
[1:28:25] but you see God the great spirit the
[1:28:28] father
[1:28:30] in him was attributes and these things
[1:28:32] that you see displayed now is just his
[1:28:34] attributes being displayed he dwelt
[1:28:36] alone
[1:28:38] he was not even God
[1:28:41] was an object of worship he was the
[1:28:43] great
[1:28:44] Eternal one
[1:28:46] and in him
[1:28:48] was attributes
[1:28:52] not with him
[1:28:58] in him
[1:29:00] drawing that line back up of what we're
[1:29:02] talking about and what you're over this
[1:29:03] way you're talking about with him
[1:29:08] were you with him
[1:29:11] before the foundational world
[1:29:13] Jesus told the disciples said I was with
[1:29:16] you
[1:29:22] you stay on that line over this way you
[1:29:24] can talk about with him I don't want to
[1:29:26] talk about with him
[1:29:29] I want to talk about anything
[1:29:33] I want to talk about that when he dwelt
[1:29:35] alone
[1:29:37] the eternal life that I have is not
[1:29:41] was a part of that life
[1:29:45] and was with him
[1:29:50] I said it the way I mean it a minute the
[1:29:52] way I said it I said the eternal life
[1:29:53] that I have now inside of me
[1:29:56] okay
[1:30:00] and then him was attributes such as to
[1:30:03] be father to be savior to be healer and
[1:30:05] now how could he first he had to be
[1:30:08] father
[1:30:09] because it proves he was father
[1:30:12] but he dwells alone
[1:30:13] he alone is immortal and now but his
[1:30:17] attributes has to be displayed
[1:30:20] now to be a savior there has to be
[1:30:22] something lost
[1:30:24] go ahead and run it upward make sure
[1:30:25] they get it
[1:30:28] and God cannot purposely lose anything
[1:30:32] and then redeem it
[1:30:36] okay
[1:30:37] solves that problem to me what did you
[1:30:39] think about it
[1:30:40] that he came purposely make something
[1:30:42] lost
[1:30:45] and redeem it
[1:30:48] you can't do it
[1:30:50] look what he said
[1:30:52] and God cannot purposely lose anything
[1:30:54] and then redeem it it wouldn't be
[1:30:55] becoming to his holiness
[1:30:58] in his great judgment
[1:31:00] why
[1:31:02] because he would be choosing
[1:31:07] he would be choosing see
[1:31:10] and that would be not
[1:31:13] right lined up with his Holiness because
[1:31:15] in Holiness is that he wants everybody
[1:31:18] to be saved
[1:31:23] that's his holiness
[1:31:28] in his great judgment
[1:31:30] that's you he just said he can't make
[1:31:33] you wrong
[1:31:35] and judge you
[1:31:38] it wouldn't be correct
[1:31:40] would he put man on three more agency
[1:31:43] knowing that knowing that man would fall
[1:31:46] and in that he became man himself in
[1:31:50] order to redeem back man that fell
[1:31:52] that's the reason that Jesus was
[1:31:54] Emmanuel
[1:31:55] if God sent another person besides
[1:31:57] himself then that wouldn't be just God
[1:32:01] had to come himself
[1:32:03] and take place
[1:32:05] and God could not be come down in spirit
[1:32:09] and take place he had to be made flesh
[1:32:12] In the Flesh of his own creative son
[1:32:16] and he showed here in the beginning that
[1:32:19] his perfect will was to create Man Out
[1:32:22] of the Dust of the Earth
[1:32:24] perfect will
[1:32:30] no
[1:32:32] you think of how close we are perfect
[1:32:34] will
[1:32:37] the fall is permissive will
[1:32:41] but by his permissive will of letting us
[1:32:44] fall we're going to come back to his
[1:32:46] perfect will
[1:32:49] if not what do you want
[1:32:53] are you women
[1:32:54] he showed here in the beginning that his
[1:32:56] perfect will was to create Man Out of
[1:32:58] the Dust of the earth he done that with
[1:32:59] Adam right
[1:33:00] but you see he permitted sex to be
[1:33:02] brought he never did intend children to
[1:33:05] be born by sex but it was permitted
[1:33:07] which soon will fade away
[1:33:12] what about
[1:33:13] God dwelling alone
[1:33:16] look at the next one let me get this one
[1:33:19] let's see
[1:33:23] no hold on let's just hold that
[1:33:25] let me get one
[1:33:30] run over to number 10 please we'll drop
[1:33:33] back on these Sunday
[1:33:35] we'll come back to go run over to number
[1:33:37] 10.
[1:33:41] paragraph 46.
[1:33:44] 47 48 who is this Melchizedek we'll get
[1:33:49] this one and quit
[1:33:50] and the beginning God dwelt Alone with
[1:33:53] his attributes now like that he dwelt
[1:33:56] alone with his attributes
[1:34:02] see I believe in eternal
[1:34:08] life
[1:34:12] and that eternal life says together is a
[1:34:14] part of God there is no life outside of
[1:34:17] that right
[1:34:19] and then
[1:34:21] we are his attributes
[1:34:24] that have eternal life
[1:34:27] there's where the problem is we must
[1:34:29] receive eternal life
[1:34:33] he was born with eternal life it's no
[1:34:35] need of a savior
[1:34:38] as I spoke of this morning that's his
[1:34:40] thoughts now where do we get back there
[1:34:43] these attributes is his thoughts
[1:34:47] and show you his thoughts are so much
[1:34:48] higher than our thoughts uh
[1:34:51] let's see what's his name uh
[1:34:53] the colleague what's your boy's name I
[1:34:55] done forgot my run
[1:34:58] now Myron and and then her brother
[1:35:00] Colleen and sister Ruth
[1:35:04] they never sat down and thought about
[1:35:06] Myra
[1:35:11] right that's right
[1:35:14] Brother Anderson sister Anderson did
[1:35:17] y'all sit down and think about
[1:35:20] oh yeah you thought about having a baby
[1:35:22] you thought about you know
[1:35:24] a name for it
[1:35:26] but that's not the way God thinks
[1:35:31] his thoughts is eternally can't have
[1:35:33] another one all right
[1:35:35] what
[1:35:37] that's his thoughts there was nothing
[1:35:40] but God alone but he had thoughts
[1:35:42] just like now what she explained here
[1:35:44] like an architect designing it then
[1:35:46] we'll get one where he said it's not
[1:35:48] like an architect
[1:35:52] and that's both times right
[1:35:55] because of what he's explaining
[1:35:58] just like a great architect
[1:36:01] can sit down in his mind and draw out
[1:36:03] what he thinks it's it's his
[1:36:07] if he is
[1:36:09] going to build
[1:36:10] create now he cannot create he can take
[1:36:13] something that's been created and make
[1:36:15] it in a different form because God is
[1:36:17] the only way only one can create but he
[1:36:20] gets in his mind what he's going to do
[1:36:22] and that's his thoughts that's his
[1:36:26] desires
[1:36:28] now it's a thought
[1:36:30] and then he speaks it
[1:36:33] and it's a word then your word is a
[1:36:36] thought
[1:36:37] what's a thought when it's expressed as
[1:36:39] a word a thought expressed is a word but
[1:36:42] it has to be a thought first
[1:36:46] so it's God's attributes
[1:36:49] then it become
[1:36:53] a thought
[1:36:55] than a word
[1:36:58] we'll come back over these
[1:37:00] but I want to end it with brother Brown
[1:37:02] says in the seal book
[1:37:06] he said first it was God's thought
[1:37:10] he said it's not a word
[1:37:14] all right
[1:37:16] he said it was given to John
[1:37:22] because he goes back to Moses and the
[1:37:24] things because where do we get down with
[1:37:25] Moses on the writing of the Bible
[1:37:30] he said it's not a word yet
[1:37:33] it's still a thought
[1:37:40] he said but then when it's spoken it
[1:37:43] becomes a word
[1:37:46] now Sister Gail when you were standing
[1:37:47] there in the kitchen cleaning and all at
[1:37:50] once something dropped down
[1:37:52] and just for a second
[1:37:56] he said where's God
[1:38:01] see that was your thought
[1:38:04] now what if you'd have never spoke that
[1:38:06] to us
[1:38:08] we could have never known what you were
[1:38:09] thinking
[1:38:12] you see one day you told us about that
[1:38:17] see it went from a thought
[1:38:20] two word
[1:38:25] and see that's what happened with Martin
[1:38:27] Luther no telling them how many times
[1:38:29] come on musician don't tell them how
[1:38:31] many times Martin Luther preached on the
[1:38:33] just you'll live by faith
[1:38:35] but one day something clicked
[1:38:41] a thought
[1:38:44] that's me
[1:38:50] and then he went and spoke it
[1:38:53] the showing that it was not a thought to
[1:38:56] others someone went out and burnt down
[1:38:58] Church buildings and destroyed places
[1:38:59] and done all kinds of things because
[1:39:01] they thought that's what he meant
[1:39:05] they never got to thought
[1:39:11] first is God's thought
[1:39:14] then it becomes a word
[1:39:19] Abraham said I'll give you a tenth
[1:39:25] Lord of all and again
[1:39:29] he picked that thought out of heaven
[1:39:33] because you think about it I'll get back
[1:39:34] on the point you think about it
[1:39:38] How could a man write what happened in
[1:39:40] Genesis
[1:39:43] to be recorded in the Bible
[1:39:48] of what happened to Genesis
[1:39:53] he went beyond his own mortal thinking
[1:39:59] into the thoughts of God
[1:40:05] back in the back part of God's mind
[1:40:09] back into his subconscious
[1:40:14] Faith lays in your subconscious
[1:40:19] is that a quote
[1:40:22] you say mama Faith that's our problem we

[1:40:28] out here oh I can tell you all the
[1:40:30] scriptures I give you all the quotes I
[1:40:33] forgive me folks
[1:40:36] for being honest
[1:40:39] but you you can get tapes the word right
[1:40:41] around them it's prayer lines prayer
[1:40:42] lines prayer lines prayer line wonderful
[1:40:45] thank God
[1:40:47] but that's not going to heal you
[1:40:51] it may think make you think into the
[1:40:54] direction to where you can be healed
[1:40:55] amen
[1:40:57] but the quotes and the things not going
[1:40:59] to heal you
[1:41:03] the Bible says thus saith the Lord
[1:41:05] you're healed
[1:41:10] why are we not healed
[1:41:13] because it's right out here
[1:41:16] in the front part of our brain and our
[1:41:18] conscious part
[1:41:20] would you let it drop back in out of
[1:41:21] that subconscious
[1:41:23] and you'll walk out and say
[1:41:25] doc it's all done
[1:41:34] it's all finished let's stand

[1:42:21] beating and everything but yet they were
[1:42:24] letting our praising God and singing
[1:42:26] God bless your name
[1:42:29] I get up in the night uh just walk
[1:42:33] through the house and you're singing
[1:42:40] sometimes it's just the same verse over
[1:42:42] and over
[1:42:44] just singing
