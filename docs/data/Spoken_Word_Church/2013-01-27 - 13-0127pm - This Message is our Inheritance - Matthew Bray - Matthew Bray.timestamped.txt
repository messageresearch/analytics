[17:47] realization the very living presence the
[17:51] pillar of fire the angel of the lord god
[17:53] your mercy and your grace are so rich to
[17:55] us in these last days god asked that you
[17:57] just open up our hearts anoint each and
[17:59] every one of us to hear what the spirit

[18:31] jesus christ's name we pray amen amen
[18:34] god bless you my brother sisters
[18:36] you can have your seats there
[18:39] we
[18:39] just been doing what y'all been doing
[18:42] having a good time in this world
[18:45] just feeding on it amen the holy ghost
[18:47] feeds on the word is that right
[18:50] and uh we just get in there and we study
[18:52] this message as best we can and just let
[18:55] the leader of the holy ghost in our
[18:57] services and we just go from from just
[19:00] you know one service to the next service
[19:02] just following the leading of the lord
[19:03] and and the message becomes more and
[19:06] more real to us
[19:08] realizing that the message was sent to
[19:10] interpret scripture right
[19:13] absolutely realizing that the spoken
[19:15] word is a key that unlocks the written
[19:18] word
[19:18] and as brother branham admonished us and
[19:21] told us this book has become a brand new
[19:23] book amen
[19:25] and i've always felt to admonish
[19:27] message believers to absolutely take the
[19:31] message back to the bible right amen
[19:33] amen and today by the grace of god we
[19:36] have
[19:37] this grace afforded to us this this open
[19:40] book and we can see things in the view
[19:43] amen brother dale in the view of the
[19:45] whole bible from genesis to revelation
[19:48] amen no longer denominational guesswork
[19:51] but thus saith the lord
[19:53] the absolute of thus saith the lord and
[19:56] not just by somebody standing up and
[19:58] giving some nice speeches or some nice
[20:01] sermons but with vindication right but
[20:04] with absolute vindication amen
[20:07] amen and haven't realized what god has
[20:10] done
[20:11] by sending a vindicated prophet to give
[20:14] us the true interpretation of the word
[20:17] right amen that is absolutely priceless
[20:20] amen and we get to where we talk about
[20:23] these things and some people might
[20:25] scratch their head and just wonder what
[20:27] in the world does all that really do for
[20:29] us having the interpretation of the word
[20:31] so yeah right you got your doctrine
[20:33] straightened out what's the big deal
[20:35] well my bible said faith comes by
[20:37] hearing and hearing by the word of god
[20:40] and if the bible's sealed up then their
[20:42] faith can only be partial their faith
[20:44] couldn't be perfect is that right but in
[20:46] these last days with an open book the
[20:48] word has become unveiled and now our
[20:50] faith can be perfect a perfect faith
[20:53] amen amen and we all know that faith and
[20:56] love are sisters
[20:57] you can't have one without the other if
[20:59] you got perfect faith you got perfect
[21:01] love
[21:02] amen perfect love is existence at the
[21:05] same time perfect faith is right amen i
[21:08] believe that don't you
[21:09] draw on that capstone you've got
[21:12] love
[21:12] and we believe this message is a
[21:14] capstone revelation the unveiling the
[21:17] apocalypse the real faith that's been
[21:20] restored right they've been in these
[21:21] last days and now our vision can be
[21:24] perfect right and now this end time
[21:26] bride can reflect
[21:28] in perfection the husband of her soul
[21:31] right
[21:32] in the church age the thing was bailed
[21:34] it was sealed
[21:35] and they can only reflect what portion
[21:38] god was quickening into that church age
[21:40] messenger in that day right
[21:42] but in this last day a prophet comes on
[21:44] the scene ties up all them loose ends
[21:47] for you and me
[21:48] so we can amen in this hour
[21:51] walk out in perfection
[21:53] we got to believe that church right amen
[21:56] we got to believe that i know that a lot
[21:57] of times we kind of walk around this
[22:00] life in a in the condition of weakness
[22:03] sometimes just wondering why prayers go
[22:05] on answer yeah
[22:07] amen
[22:08] but his strength is made perfect in our
[22:10] weakness amen right amen amen the thing
[22:13] of it is is what we're looking at
[22:16] what your faith is studying amen
[22:19] what the revelation of it is that's the
[22:20] way it is right amen faith comes by
[22:23] hearing hearing by the word of god glory
[22:26] if we're hearing the perfect word of god
[22:28] then we must be entered into
[22:30] or and have possession of a perfect
[22:32] faith
[22:33] i believe that don't you amen i believe
[22:35] the message is perfect glory i i don't
[22:37] believe if brother came back today i
[22:40] don't believe he had one thing to this
[22:41] message
[22:42] i believe it's just the way god meant it
[22:43] to me
[22:44] that's right it just takes anointed eyes
[22:47] as our brother preached today the
[22:49] revelation of
[22:51] coming together all right then we got to
[22:53] relax ourselves in the presence of god
[22:54] and let him interpret the word to our
[22:56] hearts
[22:57] put these things together
[22:59] all these quotes and all these sermons
[23:01] are just like pieces to the puzzle right
[23:03] the holy ghost comes down and anoints
[23:05] that word to our hearts and puts things
[23:07] together and we're seeing a picture
[23:10] a beautiful image amen amen
[23:13] some people might wonder now what does
[23:15] all this do for us having the perfect
[23:17] interpretation of the word having the
[23:20] vision sent having the word unveiled and
[23:22] all these things
[23:23] in the introduction of the church age
[23:25] book brother branham talks about why
[23:27] it's so important right right church
[23:29] ages gives way to the seals
[23:31] seals to the trumpets and the trumpets
[23:33] to the vials right exactly and he said
[23:36] that the study of the church ages is
[23:39] necessary
[23:40] for the understanding of the seal
[23:42] and then light upon light follows until
[23:45] the whole of the revelation is open
[23:48] before our wonder and eye that's right
[23:51] and then what
[23:52] and then we edified and purified by its
[23:55] spirit
[23:56] our what made ready right amen and then
[23:59] ready for his appearing praise god right
[24:02] that's right spiritual revelation is
[24:04] what we need to renew our minds right
[24:07] the renewing of our minds is what we
[24:09] need to be transformed amen
[24:11] amen it's important in it right
[24:14] but now
[24:15] you can see
[24:17] if god meant for us
[24:19] to really
[24:22] receive
[24:23] seed
[24:24] spoken words original seed
[24:27] and you see what satan has always been
[24:29] trying to do now for the last several
[24:31] decades the greatest battle ever fought
[24:33] is in uh
[24:35] and in your mind is where you receive
[24:38] sin amen that's right so it's satan's
[24:40] been on the job keeping people confused
[24:43] keeping them messed up putting their
[24:45] emphasis on the wrong thing exactly not
[24:48] realizing what the real program of god
[24:50] has been all along right and that is to
[24:53] just simply sit down
[24:55] and receive
[24:57] impregnation amen exactly receive seed
[25:01] glory is that right right
[25:03] we all know what happened in the garden
[25:05] of eden
[25:06] and the only way that adam had to redeem
[25:08] his wife was to put his life in her
[25:11] home is that right and in christ
[25:13] almighty in these last days has made a
[25:16] way to put his journal of life in the
[25:18] end time people is that right
[25:21] by the restoration of the apostolic
[25:23] faith through spoken word right
[25:25] is that right
[25:27] because the spoken words the original
[25:28] see
[25:30] and all these things here that we have
[25:32] in this hour i trust
[25:34] i'm pretty confident nobody in this
[25:35] church is shaken by
[25:37] all the riffraff and the rhythm of roar
[25:40] on the internet and all the the new
[25:42] websites in the books that's been
[25:43] written by people who profess to have
[25:46] been in the message for 30 something
[25:47] years
[25:49] i'm sorry but they had never been in the
[25:52] message
[25:54] my prophet said the message is christ
[25:57] in the token sermon he said the message
[26:00] is christ right is that right
[26:03] so you did it it's important as brother
[26:05] samuel dale preaches morning it's
[26:07] important to have a spiritual
[26:10] understanding right right
[26:12] you must have an approach to this
[26:13] message that's not intellectual exactly
[26:16] you don't approach the message with your
[26:17] mind you approach the message with your
[26:20] heart
[26:21] yielded and surrendered and submitted to
[26:23] god right
[26:24] brother says here in our first quote
[26:27] what is the attraction on the mountain
[26:29] i like this this is a good preaching
[26:30] quote right here amen he says but in the
[26:33] midst of all of it
[26:35] all of what all kinds of
[26:37] denominationalism organization
[26:40] half-stepping half-hearted
[26:42] dim-witted no spirit having
[26:45] intellectual approach in the word
[26:46] anything like this in the midst of all
[26:48] of it through every age and every
[26:50] prophet that had been or would be
[26:53] there's going to be
[26:54] a certain amount of people that's
[26:57] predestinated to hear that message
[27:00] amen i like what was brought out this
[27:01] morning the time is at hand it's time to
[27:04] understand glory is that right right
[27:06] amen that's right time to hear that
[27:09] message and brother brown said to hear
[27:10] is to understand amen because i said to
[27:14] see is to understand right
[27:16] predestinate to hear that message and
[27:18] they'll follow it right
[27:20] those ignore the crowds all right is
[27:23] that you today right no matter if the
[27:25] majority turns right around and says
[27:28] brother branham is not malachi 4 are you
[27:30] going to have that herd mentality
[27:32] that group think
[27:35] somebody with a revelation can't act
[27:36] like something right
[27:39] those ignore the crowns they ignore the
[27:41] criticism of the unbeliever and we got
[27:44] it heaped up today
[27:46] and they have no argument with them
[27:50] you knew it was coming right brother
[27:52] branham told you how they'd do it
[27:54] the christ the mystery of god revealed
[27:56] they'd come in there under the quietness
[27:58] of the spirit sit amongst you oh i'm a
[28:02] message believer oh yeah huh coming here
[28:04] all smooth and launching them pretty
[28:07] nice little websites
[28:09] huh
[28:10] apparently bearing record to
[28:13] the idea that god sent a profit oh yeah
[28:16] coming in and then after a while satan
[28:19] pumped that filler full of poison and
[28:21] spread around the whole church wood
[28:23] right christ the mystery of god revealed
[28:24] brother graham said satan ain't gonna
[28:26] like like
[28:27] leave this like this right back
[28:30] and what was preaching this morning we
[28:32] preached the same thing down there the
[28:33] bride ain't going through tribulation
[28:35] but you rest assured
[28:37] today's faith
[28:39] is good but you're going to need more
[28:40] tomorrow amen because it's going to get
[28:42] tighter that squeezes are coming on you
[28:45] can see it right
[28:46] we realize that now that squeeze is on
[28:48] every level and in every realm right
[28:50] politically financially religiously
[28:53] spiritually it's a squeeze
[28:55] it's a squeeze happening in every way
[28:57] and then every sense of the word as far
[28:59] as we're concerned because we see it
[29:01] happening right
[29:03] praise god the bride's not going to get
[29:05] caught in that squeeze she's going to be
[29:06] squeezed out again amen right be
[29:09] squeezed out of here
[29:12] we all know that god has a purpose for
[29:13] everything right as it was referenced
[29:16] this morning the message desperation and
[29:18] so forth
[29:19] all right
[29:20] those ignore the crowds they ignore the
[29:22] criticism of the unbeliever they have no
[29:25] argument with them they've got one thing
[29:27] to do right
[29:29] that's believe
[29:31] and get every bit of it they can
[29:34] soak it in
[29:35] soak it in amen receive seed exactly
[29:39] amen open up your heart and don't try to
[29:41] think critically or intellectually just
[29:44] let the holy spirit wool over you and
[29:46] plant that seed amen and then let him
[29:48] water that seed praise god is that right
[29:52] they've got one thing to do that's
[29:53] believe and get every bit of it they can
[29:56] and soak it in like mary who sat at the
[29:58] feet of jesus
[30:00] amen
[30:01] ain't that good amen and that quote 1a
[30:04] my brothers just real fast
[30:06] i i'm sorry let me apologize i do kind
[30:09] of preach like buckshot just
[30:12] ain't no rhyme or reason or anything too
[30:14] much just just reach out and grab
[30:16] something that's fine but i hope you get
[30:18] it
[30:21] brother branch says now we're going to
[30:22] speak tonight on this one compound
[30:24] redemptive nature over jail and now to
[30:26] get the background of our story he says
[30:28] now everything you must not take
[30:30] just one little scripture to prove
[30:32] anything
[30:34] it must lay out in the whole
[30:36] view of the bible
[30:38] and as message folk this is the grace
[30:41] that's been afforded to us
[30:44] from genesis to revelation amen exactly
[30:46] i was telling church earlier this week
[30:48] you know i can tell you exactly where in
[30:51] this bible you can find the message
[30:53] let me tell you
[30:54] from genesis to revelation
[30:56] it's all in there
[30:58] amen old testament type new testament
[31:00] fulfilled is that right
[31:02] the husband is the old testament
[31:05] the wife is the new testament right
[31:07] when the capstone of the old testament
[31:09] came it was god incarnated in christ
[31:12] right amen the capstone of the new
[31:13] testament comes it's christ incarnated
[31:16] in his bride amen that's right
[31:18] both old and new testament amen right
[31:21] that's right
[31:23] i'm glad that the oil and that anointing
[31:25] is pouring right on out of it into our
[31:27] lives amen
[31:28] praise the lord
[31:30] now that quote number two
[31:33] this is something we hit quite a bit
[31:35] especially i like to hit this vision of
[31:37] message churches because i think it's
[31:39] important to be sober minded
[31:42] about exactly what all this is about
[31:44] what does it lead to what's the purpose
[31:46] what's the intent
[31:47] isn't that so we can draw swords on
[31:49] brother and fight over a doctrine or
[31:51] anything like this
[31:53] says now we're going to end right here
[31:54] by saying this
[31:56] the end time message
[31:58] is to get the bride ready
[32:00] and prepared for the rapture all right
[32:03] right is that right
[32:05] why is everybody so concerned about it
[32:07] seems like to me everything else but the
[32:09] rapture right oh my god exactly i heard
[32:11] a message preacher say one time man you
[32:13] can't think about the rapture too much
[32:14] it'll drive you crazy oh no the rapture
[32:17] to me is going to meet jesus how could
[32:20] that drive you free
[32:24] come on now
[32:25] right blessing i want to share this with
[32:27] you real fast i don't have this up here
[32:29] but uh
[32:31] brother branham
[32:32] was talking to somebody he said someone
[32:34] said the other day brother brown you
[32:36] scared the people
[32:38] i said what do you mean
[32:39] say well saying that jesus might come
[32:41] anytime
[32:42] you know bro graham said are you a
[32:44] christian
[32:49] that's a good question right amen are
[32:51] you a christian
[32:53] he says the world seemed
[32:55] to be in that same condition know that
[32:58] something is lingering there something's
[33:00] fixing to happen
[33:01] oh it's all over the internet
[33:03] all the people in the church world
[33:05] right see it builds up a pressure of
[33:07] course
[33:08] to the center but the christian who's
[33:10] instructed in the word
[33:13] ought to know that that's the coming of
[33:16] the lord amen
[33:17] amen and shalom it always gets the
[33:19] darkness before the dawn because the
[33:21] light is pressing the darkness is that
[33:23] right but i'm so glad today amen that
[33:26] it's been revealed to us that even
[33:28] though that evil apostasy would be
[33:31] existing but at the same time arise
[33:34] shine for your lightest cause is that
[33:36] right those two conditions
[33:38] simultaneously existed
[33:40] as it was with the children of israel in
[33:43] goshen they had light but in egypt they
[33:46] had darkness that could be felt
[33:48] right brother brown took his text in
[33:50] isaiah 60 there when gross darkness
[33:52] would be upon the people
[33:54] but arise shine your light has come
[33:57] then shalom sermons he talks about the
[33:59] two existing conditions simultaneously
[34:02] one people being restored on their way
[34:04] to a millennium the other people being
[34:06] condemned on their way to the
[34:07] tribulation
[34:09] that's right
[34:11] just depends on where your faith is
[34:12] today right
[34:14] that's right it's something church this
[34:16] message is so serious
[34:19] glory
[34:20] and it's amazing to me
[34:23] dealing with people trying to help
[34:25] people
[34:26] you know get unshackled from things
[34:29] and seeing message for people that's
[34:31] been in the message before i was born
[34:35] and let the cares of the life just drag
[34:37] him off into circumstance and situation
[34:40] and then
[34:42] the message be rendered ineffectual to
[34:44] him right
[34:45] that's a serious sad place to be
[34:49] but you don't have to stay that way
[34:52] you can believe god for a renewed zeal
[34:55] and enthusiasm and a revelation on this
[34:57] word and be restored back to your love
[34:59] affair and christ right amen
[35:02] sin and the things of the world will
[35:04] make you feel so lukewarm and weak and
[35:07] beat down and non-spiritual right you
[35:10] can't sit in front of television for
[35:12] four hours and feel spiritual
[35:14] ain't no way you can't even sit in front
[35:16] of the computer for a long period of
[35:18] time
[35:19] all them pop-ups and all them
[35:21] advertisements and everything like this

[37:16] talking about everything that's going on
[37:18] people call me up on the phone say
[37:19] brother matthew did you see the
[37:21] headlines in the news i said well did

[37:27] untold to you
[37:29] is that right right man that's right
[37:32] people getting all depressed about
[37:33] everything
[37:34] so look this message was preparing you
[37:36] all along with you paying attention to
[37:38] it
[37:39] amen
[37:41] that's right
[37:43] that's true isn't it right
[37:45] amen
[37:46] must lay in the view of the whole bible
[37:49] right coming of the lord how many
[37:50] countries did he say there was
[37:52] it's three cunnings right come first to
[37:55] redeem his bride comes second to receive
[37:58] his bride and he comes third with his
[38:00] bride is that right yeah which one of
[38:03] those comings are we the most concerned
[38:06] with right now exactly right now
[38:09] something's happened right a mystery has
[38:11] been unfolding he descended with a shout
[38:14] out he's in the invisible union of a
[38:16] marriage union with his bride right now
[38:19] brother brown said in proving his word
[38:20] we don't go to the marriage the marriage
[38:22] takes place on earth we go to the
[38:24] wedding supper
[38:26] that invisible marriage union is a
[38:28] reality right now
[38:31] first corinthians chapter 6 verse 17
[38:34] he that is joined unto the lord one
[38:36] spirit right
[38:38] you can't separate a believer from
[38:40] christ right you can't separate the
[38:42] bride from christ
[38:43] that's the revelation of this message
[38:45] oneness between christ and his bride
[38:48] oneness
[38:50] i got that sermon oneness man i thought
[38:52] brother brown was going to break down
[38:53] the godhead he didn't touch godhead at
[38:55] all
[38:56] he talked about the oneness between god
[38:58] and his family right
[39:00] and it's a great thing that's opened up
[39:02] to us in this hour
[39:04] god coming down being so personal with
[39:06] his child
[39:07] opening the thing up
[39:09] walking in the believer amen
[39:11] making that believer know the hour
[39:15] to realize the scripture that's to be
[39:17] quickened right now all right brother
[39:19] brown said in the easter seal it took
[39:21] the quickening power to reveal to jesus
[39:24] what scripture he was to manifest in
[39:25] that hour right when he went into the
[39:27] temple and it was handed him the book of
[39:29] the scroll isaiah and he opened up and
[39:31] he found where it was written right and
[39:33] then in his last day god sends a prophet
[39:36] and he finds where it's written that's
[39:37] right he finds where it's written of him
[39:40] come on so we can find where it's
[39:41] written of us
[39:43] amen is that right and that same
[39:45] anointing that was on jesus was on
[39:47] brother branham and it's on the bride
[39:49] to fulfill what portion of scripture is
[39:53] wrote of her
[39:54] that's right that's where the anointing
[39:56] is amen brother samuel that's where the
[39:58] power is exactly that's why there's
[40:00] death out here in the other churches
[40:02] because they're not right where the
[40:04] spirit is quickening the word for this
[40:06] hour
[40:07] that's the difference between
[40:09] a message believer and a church member
[40:13] a real message believer knows what day
[40:15] and hour they're living in glory they
[40:17] know what portion of scripture has been
[40:19] fulfilled
[40:20] where it has been where it's all brought
[40:22] up to and what will be that's right
[40:24] is that right because the book is open
[40:27] right that's right
[40:29] and that holy spirit is anointing you
[40:32] to fulfill certain scriptures for this
[40:34] hour
[40:37] you got to believe that right right you
[40:39] got to understand that and realize
[40:41] there's a perfect realization of it all
[40:43] right
[40:44] exactly that's right as it was with the
[40:46] lord jesus he's the same yesterday today
[40:49] and forever
[40:50] that anointing come upon the bride in
[40:52] the last days you got to remember
[40:54] brother branham was not jesus he's bride
[40:57] and christ was veiled in his bride in
[40:59] these last days
[41:01] and he's the wave offering which is a
[41:03] sign and a promise that there's more to
[41:05] come just like him
[41:08] anointed right to fulfill scripture
[41:11] anointed to quicken the word amen glory
[41:14] amen now you know what i'm talking about
[41:16] there's certain scriptures laid out here
[41:18] throughout the bible that the end time
[41:20] bride is to change in the atoms
[41:22] and be caught away right there's there's
[41:24] something there written that's written
[41:26] like that right man first thessalonians
[41:28] 4 17 right but we which are alive and
[41:31] remain
[41:32] shall be caught up right
[41:34] somebody's got to fulfill that
[41:36] somebody's got to be anointed
[41:38] to fulfill that word
[41:40] exactly and the battle is well i don't
[41:43] know if i'm one or not yeah
[41:47] if you if you yeah received quickly and
[41:48] power in your soul you know you're
[41:50] wondering all right
[41:52] that's what that quickening power is for
[41:54] is to bring the word seed to life right
[41:57] is that right
[41:58] there's no such thing as a quicken
[41:59] believer not fulfilling the word right
[42:02] it's impossible right exactly a life
[42:04] lived by the word would be the word
[42:06] expressed that's right is that right
[42:08] amen that's what a true anointing is you
[42:10] know
[42:11] you know false anointed ones are just
[42:13] anointed to do manifestations and
[42:14] everything but they're off the word
[42:16] right but a true anointed bride has got
[42:18] mechanics and dynamics right she's
[42:21] anointed to walk in perfect and total
[42:23] agreement with the word right exactly
[42:26] that's right
[42:28] amen
[42:29] oh i wonder if i should get into this
[42:31] let's look here brother brown said
[42:33] something that really just
[42:35] astounded me one day he says here notice
[42:38] he's not an animal he took the book out
[42:40] of the right hand of him that set up on
[42:41] the throne
[42:42] who was it the owner the original owner
[42:45] that had the book of redemption in his
[42:47] right hand
[42:48] and no angel no in general being nothing
[42:51] else could take the place right
[42:53] and this bloody lamb walked out and took
[42:56] the book out of his hand what was it
[42:59] brother this is the most sublime thing
[43:01] in the scripture
[43:02] man exactly
[43:04] for the prophet to say that kind of
[43:06] makes me wonder man all right
[43:08] that's the most sublime thing in the
[43:10] scripture right revelations chapter 5
[43:14] when jesus came and took that book
[43:17] and and i like to follow that don't you
[43:19] in the first chapter it's a sealed book
[43:21] but in the 10th chapter it's an open
[43:22] book right and when john was told to eat
[43:25] that book brother dale he didn't need a
[43:27] closed book right he ate an open book
[43:30] amen it was already open and he was
[43:32] eating on the open book exactly is that
[43:35] right come one becoming one with it you
[43:37] are what you eat exactly and we're not
[43:39] feeding on a man we're feeding on the
[43:40] body word of the son of man exactly
[43:43] christ revealed out from themselves
[43:46] right amen christ unveiled amen
[43:49] exactly now i got to looking at this
[43:52] and uh
[43:54] and a couple scriptures came together
[43:56] that i really had a blessing of
[43:59] if you go to second chronicles with me
[44:05] this open book
[44:06] that we're talking about the restoration
[44:08] of the apostolic faith and everybody in
[44:10] here realizes
[44:12] that the apostolic faith could not be
[44:14] restored
[44:15] until actually the book was opened
[44:17] exactly
[44:18] the ministry was going on the first and
[44:20] second pool and so forth but really the
[44:22] restoration is the opening of the word
[44:24] right
[44:26] right the apostolic faith could not be
[44:28] restored without the revealing of those
[44:31] seven seals
[44:33] just study the message don't take my
[44:34] word for it but you'll find it in there
[44:36] you just follow what he teaches follow
[44:38] what he says and he'll be like
[44:39] wow duh
[44:43] it taken the revealing of the seven
[44:45] seals to restore the apostolic faith
[44:47] exactly right
[44:48] right
[44:51] so
[44:52] the restoration of this faith
[44:54] brother brown said over here was the
[44:56] very thing that was needed to get
[44:57] rapturing faith in the church
[44:59] rapturing faith would come when the
[45:01] seven thunders uttered their voices
[45:03] right exactly
[45:05] let me read it for you again just so you
[45:06] won't forget real fast
[45:08] he says this message
[45:11] oh i thought i had it right in front of
[45:12] me
[45:14] this message
[45:16] is to get the bride ready right and
[45:18] prepared for the rapture amen he says
[45:20] what can it do according to malachi 4 is
[45:23] bring them back to the faith
[45:26] that was once delivered to the saints
[45:28] bring them back to the faith of the
[45:30] fathers
[45:32] and our brother was ministering this
[45:33] morning and it was the it was like cover
[45:36] those statements you made brother it was
[45:38] like to me the entire message right just
[45:41] opening up right
[45:42] talking about the persecution that drove
[45:45] israel back to the homeland and that
[45:46] being loosed an ecclesiastical realm
[45:48] upon the brine driving her back in the
[45:50] message that's a quote amen i'm going to
[45:53] read it for you when we get to it here
[45:55] pretty soon and i'm sure your pastor is
[45:57] familiar with it when studying the
[45:59] message process before i was even a
[46:01] thought
[46:02] praise god
[46:06] oh brother i didn't mean to do it
[46:08] but i just mean you're more experienced
[46:12] the
[46:24] but uh
[46:26] you understand what i'm driving at
[46:29] i'm basically what i had in my mind
[46:31] brother dale was that i'm not going to
[46:32] tell you anything you don't already know
[46:34] that's what i was trying to say right
[46:36] but uh if it's the truth it always bears
[46:38] repeat maybe
[46:40] amen
[46:41] but uh
[46:42] you know on that's on that subject line
[46:44] there
[46:45] brother branham says that uh
[46:48] you know the homeland is the message
[46:50] right exactly being driven back into the
[46:52] homeland right
[46:54] and there's so many beautiful ways that
[46:56] brother branham brings that out because
[46:58] whenever the children of israel was
[47:01] called out by moses
[47:02] placed in the promised land by joshua
[47:05] they were coming back into the land of
[47:07] their fathers
[47:08] abraham isaac and jacob already dwelt in
[47:10] the land before they went into egypt
[47:12] right they were restored back to the
[47:14] land of their fathers this message
[47:17] restores us back to the land of our
[47:19] apostolic bodies
[47:21] so the history of israel is extremely
[47:24] important for us to be familiar with
[47:26] because you find yourself right there in
[47:28] the old testament right in the history
[47:30] of israel there you are
[47:33] being restored back the 70-year
[47:35] captivity in babylon 70 years of seven
[47:38] decades
[47:39] israel was carried away captivity in
[47:41] babylon and the church was carried away
[47:43] captivity into mystery babylon
[47:46] is that right and they've been restored
[47:48] back right restored back ain't you glad
[47:51] for that restoration
[47:52] amen
[47:54] been restored back
[47:57] and it's all over the message right you
[48:00] find out brother brown preaches a sermon
[48:01] here called paradox
[48:03] he's talking about the joshua commission
[48:06] right the first part of this sermon
[48:08] right here he says you hand me any bible
[48:10] right and i open up that bible right
[48:13] joshua chapter one exactly
[48:16] for years in my ministry you hand me any
[48:18] bible
[48:20] and it would open up to joshua chapter
[48:22] one until one day he seen in a vision a
[48:24] hand come down and the finger point to
[48:26] the first nine verses
[48:28] because the joshua phase
[48:31] started after the moses face died and he
[48:34] said moses the church age ceased with
[48:36] moses
[48:38] that's right
[48:40] i can read it for you i got to hear i
[48:41] just got it in my stats i don't mean to
[48:43] be all confused and everything but this
[48:45] message is exciting amen we've been
[48:48] restored all right we're not walking in
[48:50] old denominational guesswork
[48:53] even in the message has been referred to
[48:55] today in desperation brother brown takes
[48:58] a text out of jeremiah 29 and he's
[49:01] reading whenever god prophesied to
[49:03] jeremiah said that after
[49:06] 70 years be accomplished at babylon i
[49:08] will visit you right here and brother
[49:11] brown is taking this text
[49:13] out of this in the sermon called
[49:15] desperation and i want you to hear what
[49:17] he says he's reading it in jeremiah he
[49:19] says it will be accomplished in babylon
[49:22] i will visit you and perform my good
[49:24] work towards you and causing you to turn
[49:27] to this place
[49:29] for i know the thoughts that i think of
[49:31] you and brother grant says isn't that
[49:33] sweet
[49:34] now you know he's not taking this text
[49:36] to preach about israel's captivity he's
[49:38] taking this text to preach about the
[49:40] church's captives
[49:44] for i know the thoughts that i think
[49:45] towards you he says isn't that sweet say
[49:47] the lord those thoughts those thoughts
[49:49] of peace and not of evil to give you an
[49:52] accepted end
[49:54] like a body change yeah sounds good to
[49:56] me
[49:57] then shall you call upon me and you
[49:59] shall go and pray unto me and i will
[50:01] hearken unto you right right and you
[50:03] shall seek me and find me and when you

[50:44] meaning to the church right there you go
[50:47] glory and then over and over and over in
[50:49] the whole message you find the prophet
[50:51] using israel's history to depict the
[50:54] reality
[50:56] that we're in right now
[50:58] have you fully realized the restoration
[51:01] are you taking full advantage of it are
[51:03] you eating it up glory realizing
[51:07] praise god their old denominational
[51:09] habits and thoughts and ideas is to be
[51:12] flushed away
[51:13] washed away
[51:14] forget about tradition
[51:17] walk in the grace of the lord amen
[51:20] now i had you in revelations 5 jesus
[51:23] coming to get that book and brother
[51:25] brown says that's the most sublime
[51:27] scripture in the whole bible right
[51:30] and these great things
[51:33] let me just read you a few quotes
[51:36] so you just get the impact of these next
[51:38] two scriptures i want to share with you
[51:40] where the branch says in the preacher he
[51:42] says now god's law
[51:44] required an innocent sacrifice
[51:46] and there's a substitute
[51:48] and who was innocent
[51:51] every man had been born sexual after sex
[51:54] every one
[51:55] and the only one that wasn't he
[51:57] forfeited the rights to eternal life and
[52:00] to be king on the earth
[52:02] king
[52:04] oh when i think of that scripture for
[52:07] thou hast redeemed us back to god and we
[52:10] may reign and be kings and priests upon
[52:12] the earth right here you go number three
[52:14] oh my the kinsmen redeemer oh what a
[52:17] story
[52:18] we would have here glory notice law
[52:21] required a kinsmen redeemer to redeem a
[52:24] lost substance
[52:25] grace met this requirement
[52:28] in the person of jesus christ glory a
[52:31] kinsman must be born of the human race
[52:34] ain't you glad hey that's the gospel
[52:36] right there right amen that's good news
[52:38] all right our other brother jesus did
[52:41] exactly what we needed him to do right
[52:43] and in these last days he kept all those
[52:45] mysteries stored up for you and i right
[52:48] right as the apostle paul said in
[52:49] corinthians chapter 2 we speak wisdom
[52:51] among them that are perfect yet not the
[52:53] wisdom of this world but the hidden
[52:55] wisdom which god ordained before the
[52:58] world right to our glory come on that's
[53:01] right
[53:02] that's exactly right
[53:04] i'm so glad ain't you all right praise
[53:06] god
[53:08] he goes on to say here now
[53:11] notice in that fourth quote
[53:15] notice here he comes
[53:17] leaves the throne of an intercessor
[53:18] there's a slain land to become a lion a
[53:20] king
[53:22] to bring the whole world into judgment
[53:24] that's rejected see our kinsmen redeemer
[53:27] then is king over all right amen
[53:32] why he's got the title deed of
[53:34] redemption
[53:36] he's king
[53:38] why
[53:39] why because he's got the title deed of
[53:41] redemption right right
[53:43] see king overall why
[53:46] he's got the title deed of redemption
[53:48] right now you're in second chronicles
[53:50] yeah
[53:51] you remember the story of a failure
[53:55] athelia was jezebel and ahab's daughter
[53:58] ahab married jezebel jezebel polluted
[54:01] the northern kingdom israel they had a
[54:04] daughter named athelia and what did they
[54:05] do with her mayor hair off the jaws of
[54:08] that son
[54:09] and she corrupts judah just like jezebel
[54:12] corrupted israel right
[54:13] and in the church age you see brother
[54:15] branham bring out and pergamos
[54:18] means thoroughly wedded right church of
[54:20] state got together and then fighting the
[54:23] dark age was dominated female
[54:26] right right and then who shows up on the
[54:28] scene a failure the daughters right
[54:32] brother branham took atheia out of the
[54:33] old testament and typed it with the
[54:35] denominational
[54:37] jezebel and ahab had a daughter named
[54:40] fatty yeah and there you have church
[54:42] history right there and second kings and
[54:45] chronicles
[54:46] our church history right there right
[54:49] in the in the church age series you get
[54:51] that and brother branham mentions the
[54:52] failure twice in the church age book
[54:55] let's look it up ophthalia here she is
[54:57] in uh second chronicles chapter 23.
[55:00] joe uh i'm sorry a failure was so wicked
[55:05] she killed her grandsons
[55:08] tried to wipe them all out because they
[55:09] were in the lineage of david and one of
[55:12] them would become king right so she
[55:13] wanted to wipe them out so she could be
[55:15] ruler yeah
[55:17] you read this chapter but we're just
[55:18] going to read something here what
[55:19] happened
[55:20] in the first verse it shows you
[55:23] and in the seventh year a priest named
[55:25] jehoiada strengthened himself
[55:28] and took the captains of hundreds azera
[55:31] and the son of jehoram and ishmael the
[55:33] son of jehovah in them in
[55:36] in these names right here i just wanted
[55:38] to show you in the seventh year so when
[55:39] that boy joash was seven years old the
[55:42] priest brought him out
[55:44] out of hiding
[55:46] because that one sister took that young
[55:48] boy the seed royal and hid him from a
[55:51] failure
[55:53] right
[55:54] to preserve seed
[55:56] so the seed could take the throne
[56:00] now what happens is if you read the
[56:02] story you can read it later on but ii
[56:05] chronicles chapter 23 but the priests
[56:08] get the people
[56:10] all organized to get ready to anoint
[56:12] this king and set him on the throne
[56:15] okay
[56:16] in verse 10 he says and he said all the
[56:18] people
[56:19] every man having his weapon in his hand
[56:22] from the right side of the temple and
[56:23] the left side of the temple along the
[56:25] altar and the temple by the king round
[56:27] about right then they brought out the
[56:30] king's son joash little seven-year-old
[56:33] boy had put upon him the crown
[56:36] and gave him the testimony right
[56:39] what they did that king they gave him a
[56:41] book
[56:42] now go to deuteronomy 17
[56:45] deuteronomy chapter 17
[56:48] and this is where god was telling them
[56:51] how to handle
[56:52] a king what you what a king is supposed
[56:54] to do when a king comes to the throne of
[56:57] israel
[56:59] deuteronomy chapter 17 verse 14
[57:03] if you happen to have a scofield it says
[57:05] concerning the king right there before
[57:07] verse 14.
[57:09] and i'm just showing you how perfect
[57:11] the revelation of the message is with
[57:13] scripture amen revelation chapter 5
[57:16] brother brown says he's king now
[57:18] because why god abstract title deed in
[57:20] his hand
[57:22] and it was in israel every king that
[57:24] came to the throne he was given a copy
[57:26] of the book amen
[57:28] every single time it was to be carried
[57:30] out this way and here you have little
[57:32] joe ash they put the crown on his head
[57:34] and they give him a testimony the book
[57:36] and here in deuteronomy god's this is
[57:38] where god commands the thing to be done
[57:41] see when thou art come unto the land
[57:45] which the lord thy god giveth thee
[57:47] come on somebody
[57:49] when you come into the land
[57:51] your pastor said this message is my
[57:53] homeland
[57:54] we got a king headship came down and he
[57:57] had a book in his hand
[57:59] the bible's perfect amen this is what
[58:02] i'm excited about man i mean it's an
[58:03] open book
[58:08] is exactly what we're looking at
[58:11] see thou shall in any wise set him king
[58:15] over thee whom the lord thy god shall
[58:17] choose
[58:18] no one from among thy brethren or no one
[58:21] from among my brothers shalt thou set
[58:23] king over thee
[58:24] or excuse me
[58:26] one from among thy brethren shout thou
[58:29] set king over thee thou mayest not set a
[58:31] stranger over thee right which is not
[58:33] thy
[58:34] brother oh man
[58:36] but he shall not multiply horses to
[58:39] himself nor cause the people to return
[58:41] to egypt to the end that he should
[58:43] multiply horses for as much as the lord
[58:45] has said unto you you shall henceforth
[58:48] return no more that way right
[58:50] how in the world could somebody claim to
[58:52] be in the message and want to go join a
[58:55] church right
[58:56] it's impossible
[58:58] that's totally impossible
[59:00] i'm talking the nature the spirit the
[59:03] reality of it it is impossible right for
[59:06] a real message believer to ever get
[59:09] along in a denominational way right it's
[59:11] impossible
[59:14] now look at verse 17
[59:15] neither shall he multiply wives to
[59:17] himself that his heart turn not away
[59:20] neither shall he greatly multiply to
[59:21] himself silver and gold and it shall be
[59:24] when he sitteth upon the throne of his
[59:26] kingdom that he shall write him a copy
[59:28] of this law amen in a book out of that
[59:32] which is before the priest the levites
[59:34] amen the same thing the priesthood had
[59:36] the king was supposed to have a copy of
[59:38] it
[59:39] because when he's going to rule god's
[59:41] nation israel he does it by the book
[59:43] right he does it by the word right and
[59:46] that's how we pastor churches that's how
[59:48] we run our homes that's how we do
[59:49] everything in god's economy is by the
[59:51] book glory and then kings in israel was
[59:54] commanded to have their own copy of this
[59:57] book and what does he say here
[1:00:00] right
[1:00:01] and it shall be when he sits upon the
[1:00:03] throne of his kingdom they shall write
[1:00:04] him a copy of the law
[1:00:06] in a book of that which is before the
[1:00:08] priest the levites and it shall be with
[1:00:11] him
[1:00:12] amen
[1:00:13] and he shall read therein all the days
[1:00:15] of his life that he may learn to fear
[1:00:18] the lord as god to keep all the words of
[1:00:20] this law and these statutes and do them
[1:00:23] amen
[1:00:24] so i'm just showing you how the bible
[1:00:26] lines up perfect right all these kings
[1:00:29] was supposed to have their own copy
[1:00:31] here's jesus brother brown says in
[1:00:33] revelations 5 he was a lamb but now he's
[1:00:36] a lion right come on fixing to come into
[1:00:39] his kingdom because what's he doing he's
[1:00:41] calling for his queen to take her side
[1:00:44] by him right side by his side
[1:00:47] right
[1:00:48] and what's he doing there he's receiving
[1:00:50] a book amen an abstract title d just
[1:00:53] like it happened with the kings of
[1:00:54] israel i think that's beautiful right
[1:00:57] all right i think that's wonderful amen
[1:00:59] praise the lord god and now
[1:01:02] our lord jesus christ didn't keep that
[1:01:04] book did he
[1:01:05] he descended with it with an oak after
[1:01:07] he loosened the seven seals and he told
[1:01:10] john who represents you right to eat the
[1:01:12] book right so where does this abstract
[1:01:14] title need to finally wind up in in you
[1:01:17] all right that's right exactly right
[1:01:20] you have a right
[1:01:22] to the tree of life all right brother
[1:01:25] said you have a right to it
[1:01:27] it is now your right
[1:01:30] to access the tree yes right
[1:01:33] that's right
[1:01:34] and it's just as simple as romans
[1:01:36] chapter 5 my friend right if you'd like
[1:01:38] to read it with me
[1:01:43] i'm sure you all are aware
[1:01:46] that adam and eve was blocked
[1:01:50] from having access to the tree of life
[1:01:54] and why
[1:01:56] lest they live forever right
[1:01:59] brother branham brings out in the
[1:02:00] revelation series revelations chapter
[1:02:03] four part one two and three
[1:02:05] that the cherubs
[1:02:07] that blocked their way was the four
[1:02:10] beasts
[1:02:12] he said there's only four ways you can
[1:02:13] go and they block the way to the tree of
[1:02:16] life all four ways they've locked it
[1:02:19] and got right
[1:02:20] so in the book of genesis you have four
[1:02:22] cherubims blocking the way but in the
[1:02:24] book of revelation you have four cherubs
[1:02:26] say come see you right exactly the way
[1:02:28] the access is now already
[1:02:30] you have access to the tree of life
[1:02:33] there's no reason for you as a believer
[1:02:35] to die in this age you can go home in a
[1:02:38] rapture now
[1:02:40] because the thing is open right back
[1:02:42] there i want that to be so emblazoned in
[1:02:44] my heart and in my mind that immortality
[1:02:47] has been opened right
[1:02:49] the passageway access to christ unless
[1:02:52] you eat my flesh and drink my blood you
[1:02:54] have no life in you he's made a way for
[1:02:56] his end time bride to receive
[1:02:59] life amen his literal life you know
[1:03:02] brother brown never preached a token
[1:03:03] till after the seals were opened right
[1:03:05] he never titled a message token
[1:03:07] right attacking token message came
[1:03:10] september 63.
[1:03:12] and he said the token is the literal
[1:03:14] life right
[1:03:16] amen hear him teach the difference
[1:03:18] between that and what the church ages
[1:03:20] had and you understand why we can be
[1:03:22] expected
[1:03:23] to be immortalized right exactly that
[1:03:26] divine life remember that that elisha
[1:03:28] and them were having lunch and they
[1:03:30] threw wild gourds in that pot and they
[1:03:32] said elijah's death in the pot and he
[1:03:35] went and got a hand of meal which is the
[1:03:37] type of christ and he re-leavened the
[1:03:39] pot with life exactly right
[1:03:42] that's what's been happening here
[1:03:44] we've been relevant with divine life
[1:03:47] through spoken word right
[1:03:50] that's right
[1:03:51] amen spoken word has been god's perfect
[1:03:54] will all along right
[1:03:56] he permitted us to come the way we did
[1:03:58] that wasn't his perfect will right but
[1:04:00] now we're born by the incorruptible seed
[1:04:02] of god's word
[1:04:05] romans chapter 5 says therefore
[1:04:07] being justified by
[1:04:09] faith
[1:04:10] revelation
[1:04:13] we have peace with god right
[1:04:17] through our lord jesus christ
[1:04:20] by whom also we have
[1:04:23] access right
[1:04:25] i just want you to picture yourself
[1:04:27] walking right on past them cherubs right
[1:04:30] up to the tree of life and partake
[1:04:33] of the tree of life
[1:04:35] partake of him right
[1:04:38] because he's wide open the way is open
[1:04:40] amen
[1:04:42] it's by faith i'll admit to you it's my
[1:04:44] faith but it's there
[1:04:46] his presence has come down he had a
[1:04:49] prophet here to identify his presence
[1:04:51] right
[1:04:52] say he's right amongst you now right
[1:04:55] is that right
[1:04:56] i don't believe he left when brother
[1:04:57] branham left all right i don't believe
[1:04:59] that right
[1:05:01] he's still in that uh form of his
[1:05:03] angelic body the theophany moving in and
[1:05:05] out among his bride clicking in whom he
[1:05:07] will
[1:05:08] i believe that when you see this as
[1:05:10] eagle food you leave the other thing
[1:05:12] you've heard from your theophany
[1:05:15] that's right restore it back to your
[1:05:17] word body what you're supposed to have
[1:05:19] before the fall come on
[1:05:32] that's what this message does
[1:05:37] praise god you can't step it down stab a
[1:05:39] dead man in the back he's already dead
[1:05:42] praise god bless him be carried away
[1:05:45] into christ
[1:05:47] praise god aren't you glad amen right
[1:05:50] let's see where i am here now
[1:05:52] blessing i believe that the whole word
[1:05:55] has been given don't you
[1:05:57] amen there's quote after quote after
[1:05:59] quote the seven seals brought in the
[1:06:02] whole amen amen and the full power of
[1:06:05] its strength as it was when he was here
[1:06:07] the opening of the word means more to us
[1:06:09] than possibly we can even imagine right
[1:06:12] the opening of that word amen the advent
[1:06:14] of a vindicated prophet to reveal jesus
[1:06:16] christ being the same yesterday today
[1:06:18] and forever amen
[1:06:20] absolutely incredible listen to this he
[1:06:22] says
[1:06:23] now we have a sacred trust
[1:06:26] you know what a trust is
[1:06:28] and we have an inheritance
[1:06:30] a heritage that we inherit as believe in
[1:06:33] children
[1:06:35] it's a sacred trust and that sacred
[1:06:38] trust and our sacred heritage is the
[1:06:40] word of god that's been given to us
[1:06:42] right right exactly the full word of god
[1:06:45] glory
[1:06:47] not part word right full word right
[1:06:51] the word itself is the vitamin and glory
[1:06:54] right the word itself god's word
[1:06:56] that's where the reason i'm so dogmatic
[1:06:59] come on
[1:07:01] hear him explain that and spoken words
[1:07:03] original seed this is why brethren i've
[1:07:06] stood the way i have
[1:07:07] you can't bring forth wheat unless you
[1:07:10] plant weeds
[1:07:12] you can't bring forth a bride unless you
[1:07:14] sow for the bride all right
[1:07:16] i don't know what else we're supposed to
[1:07:18] preach go home exactly
[1:07:21] hey if the word of god don't turn you on
[1:07:24] it's not my fault right
[1:07:26] it's not my fault exactly if the
[1:07:28] revelation of the word don't stimulate
[1:07:30] you
[1:07:30] not my problem
[1:07:35] no i don't mean to be so sound abrasive
[1:07:37] and everything but i mean to tell you
[1:07:39] we're living in a time
[1:07:41] when the the effectual outworkings of
[1:07:43] the word is diminishing because
[1:07:45] the capstone age is honed down and the
[1:07:48] elect is coming into an absolute
[1:07:50] minority
[1:07:52] but i believe that the word of god is
[1:07:54] effectual upon those who are
[1:07:56] predestinated right
[1:07:57] amen
[1:07:58] and it's going to have its work that's
[1:08:00] right it's going to accomplish that
[1:08:02] which he purposefully comes
[1:08:05] amen amen
[1:08:07] so praise god let that word be effectual
[1:08:09] in us amen amen
[1:08:13] now i know y'all been studying the
[1:08:15] message and having a good time but i
[1:08:17] just want to encourage you to stay right
[1:08:19] there and start looking into these
[1:08:21] revealed truths
[1:08:23] because you're in this is what leads to
[1:08:25] your immortality right this is this
[1:08:27] revelation now you realize the new birth
[1:08:29] takes place by a revelation
[1:08:32] all divine healing takes place by
[1:08:34] revelation and your body changing the
[1:08:36] rapture ain't no different exactly it's
[1:08:38] got to be by a revelation by faith
[1:08:42] is that right so you ain't got nothing
[1:08:44] else to do
[1:08:45] but just stay right in the middle of the
[1:08:47] road stay with this word keep feeding on
[1:08:50] it and keep crying out to god to open
[1:08:52] more and more let that stimulation
[1:08:54] praise god come into your life greater
[1:08:56] and greater
[1:08:59] it's the stimulation that brain the
[1:09:01] revelation of it amen
[1:09:03] now uh
[1:09:04] praise god y'all don't look tired i
[1:09:06] ain't seen nobody young you're just
[1:09:07] encouraging me to keep going a little
[1:09:09] bit here
[1:09:19] now here's this quote this is what i
[1:09:21] kept hitting my mind when when my
[1:09:23] brother was ministering this morning
[1:09:26] my homeland is his message
[1:09:28] that's a direct quote out of gabriel's
[1:09:30] instructions today
[1:09:32] he says that uh talking about israel
[1:09:36] this is really really strong right here
[1:09:39] listen to this he says look at israel
[1:09:41] when they were sent down into egypt 400
[1:09:44] years not one miracle not one sign not
[1:09:47] one thing happened among them not
[1:09:49] recorded in the history of the book
[1:09:51] same old nine and nine
[1:09:53] go to church offer the lamb say hell
[1:09:55] mary or whatever it was go back
[1:09:58] next year same way the priest all argued
[1:10:01] rabbi so and so we'll elect rabbi
[1:10:03] so-and-so and he's got a better
[1:10:04] scholarship he knows more about the
[1:10:06] egyptians
[1:10:08] the first thing you know
[1:10:10] the egyptians and all them was the
[1:10:12] salmon right
[1:10:14] oh what a horrible testimony
[1:10:18] what a horrible testimony right it was
[1:10:20] down in there for so long
[1:10:22] you couldn't tell the difference between
[1:10:24] an egyptian or an israelite right oh my
[1:10:26] god have mercy
[1:10:28] i feel like some message folk been here
[1:10:30] for so long
[1:10:31] they've done let down on the word
[1:10:33] they're let down on the standard and now
[1:10:35] you can't tell the difference between
[1:10:36] them and the world right
[1:10:38] exactly
[1:10:39] just because it's been 50 something
[1:10:41] years this upcoming march 17th will be
[1:10:43] 50 years since the sealed open yeah that
[1:10:46] don't mean that the word is not coming
[1:10:48] to pass
[1:10:50] just because as time goes by here don't
[1:10:52] mean god didn't still mean it
[1:10:54] god meant
[1:10:56] what he said through this problem and it
[1:10:58] still holds all right and it's still in
[1:11:00] effect
[1:11:02] praise god
[1:11:05] it's like the brother was preaching
[1:11:07] today
[1:11:08] 2050 wouldn't change his message one bit
[1:11:12] still be the truth right
[1:11:14] bill brown said there'd be a certain
[1:11:16] amount of people follow it
[1:11:17] right and they'll stay with it amen
[1:11:21] he says then he says here that's the
[1:11:24] same things happen to the church we've
[1:11:26] all went to be methodist baptist
[1:11:28] presbyterian we all got our degree out
[1:11:31] of hartford we got a degree out of
[1:11:32] wheaton we got a degree out of somewhere
[1:11:34] else or bob jones or got a bachelor of
[1:11:37] art we got a dd an lld or something
[1:11:39] other what is it amounted to a bunch of
[1:11:42] nonsense
[1:11:43] putting emphasis on the wrong thing
[1:11:46] right
[1:11:47] and people just that human nature seems
[1:11:49] to do that all the time
[1:11:51] remember since this message was sent to
[1:11:54] get the bride ready and prepared for a
[1:11:57] rapture right
[1:11:59] not just to have the message as a
[1:12:01] centerpiece on your coffee table
[1:12:03] not just to have a pretty bookshelf with
[1:12:05] nice books on it it's that word is to
[1:12:09] come spirit and life in you
[1:12:12] a life lived by the word would be the
[1:12:14] word expressed
[1:12:16] and he's come to take his word home in a
[1:12:18] rapture glory because it's the word
[1:12:20] joining with the word
[1:12:22] and he says and god
[1:12:24] never did deal with israel till she come
[1:12:27] to her homeland right exactly he says
[1:12:30] hear me
[1:12:31] thus saith the lord
[1:12:33] god will not deal with this church until
[1:12:35] she comes back to the homeland the
[1:12:37] message of the hour
[1:12:39] that's right
[1:12:40] all right that's the homeland
[1:12:43] amen
[1:12:46] and this is this is all over the message
[1:12:48] whenever you find you know how it is
[1:12:50] when you get a you buy a car
[1:12:53] and you think that you hardly ever seen
[1:12:55] your car around town very much then you
[1:12:57] get in and start driving around
[1:12:58] everywhere you look everybody got the
[1:13:00] same car you got it
[1:13:02] you just never noticed it before
[1:13:04] once these little things open to you
[1:13:06] either man
[1:13:07] that's nice and then every time you go
[1:13:09] the message that's all you see yeah
[1:13:11] exactly that's right it just got to be
[1:13:13] open to you a little bit and then that
[1:13:14] light will start shining
[1:13:17] that's right we've been walking in the
[1:13:19] homeland ever since 1963 when the word's
[1:13:22] been opened exactly god's just waiting
[1:13:24] for that light to dawn on his
[1:13:26] predestinated seat and bring her to a
[1:13:28] ripening right
[1:13:29] place
[1:13:30] right trying to get his church and
[1:13:32] speaking conditions
[1:13:34] trying to get his people matured
[1:13:37] realize what's happened
[1:13:39] of course you know invisible union of
[1:13:40] the bride of christ he illustrates the
[1:13:42] same point years later
[1:13:45] and brother brown was bringing out
[1:13:46] things about the seals in 1954. all
[1:13:49] right
[1:13:50] and the things he said in 1954 is
[1:13:52] exactly what he said in 1963 amen
[1:13:55] you'd get a whole lot of light on the
[1:13:56] seventh seal before the seals was even
[1:13:59] breached all right the raster knows
[1:14:01] pastor knows
[1:14:03] i feel sorry for these folks right here
[1:14:04] don't know the seventh seal has been
[1:14:06] open
[1:14:06] there's a lot of them too many of them
[1:14:08] right they need to get in that message
[1:14:10] and read what the product said
[1:14:12] brother branham was a master teacher
[1:14:14] gloria he could hide something and
[1:14:16] reveal something at the same time
[1:14:21] that's right
[1:14:23] and that's the way it is in this message
[1:14:25] you got to relax and let god be your
[1:14:27] lover let god be the one to lead you and
[1:14:30] guide you and show you
[1:14:32] flesh and blood can't give you anything
[1:14:34] right you've got to spend time with god
[1:14:36] in god's presence and take this word
[1:14:38] into the presence of god
[1:14:41] that's right
[1:14:42] praise the lord god i thank god for
[1:14:44] revelation don't you amen amen amen
[1:14:49] now invisible union of the bride of
[1:14:50] christ
[1:14:52] brother branham is implying the same
[1:14:54] thing
[1:14:55] that he's saying here about the homeland
[1:14:57] being the message yeah right
[1:15:00] he says now you may say
[1:15:02] what's this all got to do with
[1:15:04] thanksgiving
[1:15:05] because he's down there at jack moore's
[1:15:06] around thanksgiving in 1965
[1:15:09] he says what are you talking about
[1:15:10] brother brown here it is quarter to nine
[1:15:12] you didn't say nothing about
[1:15:13] thanksgiving
[1:15:15] and he says what a message for the
[1:15:16] occasion to me gloria yes indeed the
[1:15:19] pilgrim fathers were very thankful
[1:15:22] for their new found way of life
[1:15:25] being separated from the old english
[1:15:28] denominations and creeds
[1:15:30] they could marry to the new anointed
[1:15:33] word for their age
[1:15:35] that's right the new anointed word for
[1:15:37] their age for their day amen
[1:15:40] what the holy ghost is quickening today
[1:15:43] right what jesus is doing now
[1:15:46] find out what part of this bible he's
[1:15:48] manifested today you'll find out where
[1:15:50] the anointing is you find out where the
[1:15:52] victory is you find out where the mind
[1:15:54] of god is
[1:15:56] god's trying to bring something to pass
[1:15:58] right
[1:15:59] like he did in every age
[1:16:01] he's bringing something to pass in this
[1:16:03] age
[1:16:05] so can we be thankful as pilgrims like
[1:16:07] abraham separate ourselves from the
[1:16:09] things of the world
[1:16:10] all of our associates abraham was a
[1:16:12] pilgrim god has separated us from all
[1:16:15] the dead religions
[1:16:17] i'm speaking across the nation now all
[1:16:19] the dead creeds and to what separated us
[1:16:22] and opened to us a new land right
[1:16:26] a new message
[1:16:28] for this day amen
[1:16:30] amen let's go over here to joshua
[1:16:32] chapter 18. i don't have no quotes for
[1:16:34] this pastor but i'm just reading the
[1:16:36] bible and looking at what happened yeah
[1:16:39] perhaps you're already conscious of this
[1:16:42] but in joshua chapter 18 man we got into
[1:16:44] the adoption messages that message
[1:16:47] called paradox and we just
[1:16:50] listen to the message and read our bible
[1:16:52] right and it just opens up man
[1:16:56] just it's amazing what you find out when
[1:16:59] you read your bible in the light of a
[1:17:02] vindicated prophet right
[1:17:04] that's it in the light of the spoken
[1:17:06] word you read the scriptures
[1:17:10] that that's what god has done for us
[1:17:13] we need to be taken advantage of right
[1:17:17] in joshua chapter 18
[1:17:20] what we have here it's explaining to us
[1:17:23] something that happened
[1:17:26] now moses placed two and a half tribes
[1:17:28] on the east side of jordan exactly
[1:17:31] okay amen those tribes was reuben gad
[1:17:34] and half the tribe of manasseh
[1:17:37] when they crossed over joshua
[1:17:38] immediately placed judah ephraim and the
[1:17:41] other half tribe of manasseh that's two
[1:17:44] and a half plus two and a half which is
[1:17:46] five
[1:17:47] right
[1:17:49] then how many does that leave out of
[1:17:50] twelve
[1:17:51] seven right so joshua here in chapter 18
[1:17:56] it says
[1:17:57] and the whole congregation of the
[1:17:58] children of israel assembled together at
[1:18:00] shiloh right tranquility place of god's
[1:18:03] rest that's where the tabernacle rested
[1:18:05] the ark of the covenant was there
[1:18:08] and set up the tabernacle of the
[1:18:09] congregation there and the land was
[1:18:11] subdued before them and they remained
[1:18:14] among the children of israel seven
[1:18:16] tribes which had not yet received their
[1:18:19] inheritance
[1:18:20] and joshua said unto the children of
[1:18:22] israel how long are you slack right
[1:18:25] kind of reminds me when jesus spoke to
[1:18:26] his two disciples right oh slow of heart
[1:18:29] right
[1:18:31] yeah
[1:18:32] slow of heart lady will see it done
[1:18:34] question your eyes over right wake up to
[1:18:36] righteousness amen realize what's
[1:18:38] happened gloria
[1:18:41] and joshua said unto the children of
[1:18:43] israel how long are you slept to go
[1:18:44] possess the land which the lord god of
[1:18:47] your fathers have given you
[1:18:49] give out from among you there three men
[1:18:51] of each tribe and i will send them and
[1:18:53] they shall rise and go through the land
[1:18:55] and describe it according to the
[1:18:57] inheritance of them and they shall come
[1:18:59] again to me
[1:19:01] and they shall divide it into seven
[1:19:03] parts
[1:19:04] judah shall abide in their coast in the
[1:19:06] south and the house of joseph shall
[1:19:07] abide and they're closed on the north
[1:19:09] you shall therefore describe the land
[1:19:11] into seven parts
[1:19:13] and bring the description hither to me
[1:19:15] that i may cast lots for you here before
[1:19:18] the lord our god
[1:19:20] but the levites of course have no part
[1:19:21] among you for the priesthood of the lord
[1:19:23] is their inheritance and gad and reuben
[1:19:26] have to travel to nasa have received
[1:19:27] their inheritance beyond jordan on the
[1:19:29] east which moses the servant lord gave
[1:19:31] them
[1:19:32] and the men arose and went away and
[1:19:34] joshua charged them that went to
[1:19:36] describe the land saying go and walk to
[1:19:40] the land and describe it and come again
[1:19:42] to me that i may hear cast lots for you
[1:19:45] before the lord in shiloh
[1:19:47] now listen here
[1:19:49] and the men went and passed through the
[1:19:51] land and described it by cities into
[1:19:53] seven parts in a book amen
[1:19:56] and this bible is a seven part book come
[1:19:59] on right right the joshua ministry has
[1:20:02] repeated itself right in these last days
[1:20:05] you understand amen what was they doing
[1:20:08] they was getting placed positionally
[1:20:10] right adopted into the new land amen
[1:20:15] is that right right
[1:20:17] now don't take my word for this i'm just
[1:20:18] trying to provoke you right and
[1:20:21] poke you and pride you
[1:20:24] real
[1:20:25] adoption
[1:20:26] could not ever be really realized for
[1:20:29] the age until after the seals were open
[1:20:31] come on man exactly amen until after the
[1:20:33] seals were open right now here you have
[1:20:36] joshua telling the seven final tribes to
[1:20:39] go write their inheritance in a book
[1:20:41] bring it back to me and if you go on and
[1:20:43] read he stood in the door of the
[1:20:45] tabernacle in shiloh and cast lots and
[1:20:48] divided a seven part book right
[1:20:51] come on somebody amen
[1:20:53] sounds like something happened in these
[1:20:54] last days
[1:20:58] and described it by cities in seven
[1:21:00] parts in a book and came again to joshua
[1:21:03] to the host at shiloh
[1:21:05] and joshua cast locks for them is
[1:21:07] shallow before the lord and then in
[1:21:09] verse 51 and chapter 19
[1:21:12] it says that uh divided foreign
[1:21:14] inheritance by light and shiloh before
[1:21:16] the lord at the door of the tabernacle
[1:21:19] of the congregation and y'all know who
[1:21:21] the door is right brother branham stood
[1:21:23] in the door right he stood in christ
[1:21:25] amen right
[1:21:26] right right man
[1:21:28] god had to enter into that prophet to do
[1:21:30] this work right
[1:21:32] just like he entered into moses to bring
[1:21:34] out that word right god entered into
[1:21:36] brother branham brother brown stood in
[1:21:38] the door per se
[1:21:39] and divided a seven part book so the end
[1:21:42] time bride can receive her inheritance
[1:21:44] glory the new land that she's walking in
[1:21:47] the adoption
[1:21:48] replacing
[1:21:50] amen
[1:21:52] this bible
[1:21:53] is wide open amen you just gotta read it
[1:21:57] right you gotta meditate in it right
[1:21:59] brother brown said i love good singing
[1:22:02] but the greatest thing i have for
[1:22:04] enjoyment is meditating in the word
[1:22:06] right
[1:22:07] that's what he said man praise god and i
[1:22:10] don't feel like i shared anything with
[1:22:12] you you didn't already know because

[1:23:11] ease that's right brother i don't mean

[1:23:50] when i started studying this message i
[1:23:52] said well
[1:23:56] they just ain't nothing else
[1:24:00] i like to read what somebody else says
[1:24:02] on this side of the other but right
[1:24:04] when it comes to the word
[1:24:05] they hear what the prophet had to say
[1:24:08] that way i could sit right down and
[1:24:10] feast on it
[1:24:13] seven course meals
[1:24:37] god never died when the prophet
[1:24:55] if you don't think about
[1:24:57] persecution
[1:24:58] a little tribulation you know coming to
[1:25:01] get us ready what about your prophets
[1:25:03] you must not want the third fool
[1:25:07] he says when the truth when the
[1:25:08] persecutions tried what's that dirt
[1:25:11] building
[1:25:12] evidently they put on it
[1:25:17] bring on the persecution yeah
[1:25:50] and we're singing about it
[1:25:57] is
[1:26:30] the greatest mystery that could ever be
[1:26:33] is that god used to live
[1:26:38] manifest himself in his people
[1:26:43] give him that race to jesus
[1:26:50] telling me
[1:27:20] hallelujah

[1:28:03] we said you hear other people that want
[1:28:05] to stand
[1:28:06] in the end
[1:28:08] when it's all falling apart but let it
[1:28:10] be
[1:28:11] it's got to be that way
[1:28:14] it's not that we try to find and see if
[1:28:16] we can all agree
[1:28:18] no
[1:28:20] it's to have the same spirit
[1:28:22] that will bring us all together
[1:28:25] in christ
[1:28:28] he'll just bring us together amen
[1:28:31] right because that's the way it's
[1:28:32] supposed to be
[1:28:34] then we don't have any trouble
[1:28:36] so you just make sure to tell the
[1:28:37] brother how much you appreciate it i
