[0:03] if y'all remember where we were last
[0:04] time we were looking at uh Matthew 1 the
[0:07] book of the generations of Adam I mean
[0:09] of Jesus Christ but um before we turn
[0:13] there I'm going to start at
[0:15] Galatians chapter 3 because I got to um
[0:20] studying on the the generations and
[0:22] really uh I kind of started studying on
[0:25] the birth right so I want to um start at
[0:28] Abraham and kind of go down the
[0:30] birthright blessings the Covenant and
[0:32] all the way through the um if you look
[0:35] at the birthright it's uh kind of
[0:37] difficult to understand sometimes
[0:38] because the birth right has a there's a
[0:40] natural birth right and a spiritual
[0:41] birth right there's natural the promise
[0:43] of natural Kings and the promise of
[0:46] Kings and Priests we become Kings and
[0:48] Priests in the kingdom kingdom so uh
[0:51] we'll compare all that and uh's let's
[0:53] just start at Galatians chter
[0:55] 3 verse
[0:58] 5 and um where we're going is um how
[1:03] that The Blessing of Abraham came on the
[1:06] Gentiles through Jesus
[1:10] Christ so let's start at Galatians
[1:14] 35 he therefore that ministereth to you
[1:17] the spirit and worketh miracles among
[1:20] you doeth he it by The Works of the law
[1:23] or by the hearing of
[1:26] Faith remember brother brand talked
[1:28] about two covenants the first Covenant
[1:30] with with Adam was you got to obey me
[1:34] and then he established a second
[1:35] Covenant which was unconditional that if
[1:37] you're part of the circumcision if
[1:38] you're part of the new birth then he's
[1:40] going to bring you to where you're
[1:42] supposed to
[1:45] go even as Abraham believed God and it
[1:49] was accounted to him for
[1:50] righteousness know ye therefore that
[1:52] they which are a faith faith the same
[1:55] are the children of Abraham and the
[1:58] scripture foreseeing that God would just
[1:59] justify the Heathen through faith that's
[2:02] us preached before the gospel unto
[2:04] Abraham saying in the shall All Nations
[2:07] be
[2:08] blessed and we'll see in a second this
[2:10] is part of the Covenant that the
[2:12] Covenant with Abraham was that there
[2:14] would be Kings come out of him there
[2:16] would be many nations so this is part of
[2:19] the Covenant in these shall All Nations
[2:21] be blessed so then they which be of
[2:23] Faith are blessed with faithful Abraham
[2:27] for as many as are of the works of the
[2:29] law are under the curse for it is
[2:31] written cursed is everyone that
[2:33] continueth not in all things which are
[2:35] written in the book of the law to do
[2:38] them but then no man is justified by the
[2:40] law in the sight of God it is evident
[2:43] for the just shall live by faith and the
[2:46] law is not of Faith but the man that
[2:49] doeth them shall live in them Christ
[2:52] hath redeemed us from the curse of the
[2:54] law being made a curse for us for it is
[2:57] written cursed is everyone that HTH on
[2:59] on the tree that The Blessing of Abraham
[3:02] might come on the Gentiles through Jesus
[3:04] Christ that we might receive the promise
[3:06] of the spirit through
[3:09] faith Brethren I speak after the manner
[3:12] of men though it be but a man's Covenant
[3:14] yet if it be confirmed no man disan
[3:16] knowth or added thereto now to Abraham
[3:19] and his Seed where the promis is made he
[3:20] saith not and to seeds as of many but as
[3:23] of one and to th to thy seed which is
[3:27] Christ and this I say that the Covenant
[3:29] that was confirmed before of God in
[3:31] Christ the law which was 430 years after
[3:35] cannot disan that it should make the
[3:37] promise of none effect for if the
[3:39] inheritance be of the law it is no more
[3:41] promise but God gave it to Abraham by
[3:44] promise wherefore then serveth the law
[3:47] it was added because of transgressions
[3:49] till the seed of Christ should come to
[3:52] whom the promise was made and it was
[3:53] ordained by angels in the hand of a
[3:55] median so let's
[3:58] um at as we go through the the
[4:01] birthright
[4:03] promises remember there's a promise of
[4:05] many nations a promise of a perpetuated
[4:08] kingdom house throne and a
[4:13] priesthood and um just to kind of give
[4:17] an idea of where we're going brother ROM
[4:19] talked about what the birthright is to
[4:22] us and hearing recognizing acting on the
[4:25] work of God on the word of God 1960 now
[4:28] anyone knows that the Seal of God is the
[4:30] birth right the baptism of the Holy
[4:33] Ghost because it's your right from God
[4:35] it's your right to the firstborn and
[4:37] we're part of the firstborn the
[4:39] firstborn of all
[4:40] creation which is
[4:43] Christ hearing receiving and acting
[4:46] 1960 so it didn't mean anything to Esau
[4:49] he despised it and the carnal believer
[4:50] today still despises that Birthright and
[4:53] the birthright is the holy spirit we
[4:55] know we are we know that and the carnal
[4:57] believer despises that oh he said them
[4:59] days are passed there's no such a thing
[5:01] as receiving the Holy Ghost anymore that
[5:03] was way back that was in back in the
[5:05] apostles
[5:07] time
[5:09] so let's
[5:12] start at Abraham in Genesis chapter
[5:26] 12 and keep in mind the context of this
[5:29] is the generations of Jesus Christ and
[5:32] it's in in Matthew 1 and it starts in
[5:35] Abraham so that's that's why we're
[5:37] starting in Abraham to go through
[5:39] Matthew's
[5:42] genealogy and the first thing that God
[5:44] did God told Abraham to do was separate
[5:47] himself now the Lord said unto Abram in
[5:50] verse one get thee out of thy country
[5:52] and from thy Kindred and from thy
[5:54] Father's House unto a land that I will
[5:56] show thee and I will make of thee a
[5:59] great nation and I will bless thee and
[6:00] make thy name great and thou shalt be a
[6:03] blessing he said he'll make him a great
[6:06] nation but later on we'll read that he
[6:08] he's going to he's promising him to to
[6:10] to give him many nations to be the
[6:13] father of many
[6:15] nations and I will bless them that bless
[6:18] thee and curse him that curse thee and
[6:20] in thee shall all families of the of the
[6:23] earth be
[6:24] blessed so starting out Abraham's got to
[6:28] separate himself from the things of the
[6:30] world from uh he got to get it get out
[6:33] of the country get away from uh all the
[6:36] old things that he knew all of the kind
[6:38] of the denominational Concepts and
[6:40] things that we're we're trying to get
[6:42] out of us through the walk up the statue
[6:44] of a perfect
[6:45] man and then God can bless
[6:49] him let's turn
[6:51] to chapter
[6:56] 13 let's look at verse 14 and I gave
[7:00] brother Joe my notes to put on the web
[7:02] but um I I was scrambling this morning
[7:05] to I I realized I left out Genesis 13 in
[7:08] the notes so um I I'll try to get him an
[7:11] update um but this is where the uh God
[7:15] first establishes his Covenant with
[7:17] Abraham then he comes along later and
[7:19] confirms it verse 14 and the Lord
[7:22] said unto Abram after that lot was
[7:25] separated from him after that lot was
[7:28] separated from him so he had to be
[7:30] separated first lift up now thine eyes
[7:33] and look from the place where thou art
[7:35] northward and Southward and Eastward and
[7:37] Westward everything that he could see
[7:38] for all the land which thou seest to
[7:40] thee will I give it and to thy seed
[7:43] forever now remember as we go through
[7:45] this there's a a a natural and a
[7:48] spiritual CU God gives you the uh I was
[7:52] reading the if you remember the story of
[7:54] nabas Vineyard when Ahab tried to take
[7:56] NAB Vineyard away he said for God forbid
[7:59] that I would sell my inheritance cuz
[8:01] this is it's my god-given right God
[8:04] forbid that you would
[8:07] uh you know it's it's something that
[8:09] nobody can take away from
[8:13] you let's see for all the land which
[8:15] thou seest to thee will I give it and to
[8:17] thy seed forever so the land the natural
[8:20] land is Promised but also think of it
[8:23] spiritually that God has promised to you
[8:26] all of these blessings and God forbid
[8:28] that any body would try to take it from
[8:30] you or that you would give it away and I
[8:33] I will make thy seed as the dust of the
[8:35] earth so that if a man can number the
[8:37] dust of the earth then shall th seed
[8:39] also be numbered now remember there's
[8:42] natural and spiritual dust of the Earth
[8:44] this is natural and later on we're going
[8:46] to see how God said look up to the stars
[8:48] of Heaven the spiritual seed that's
[8:51] us arise walk through the land and the
[8:54] length of it and the breadth of it for I
[8:56] will give it unto thee go ahead and walk
[8:58] through it and see what God God's
[8:59] promise to
[9:01] you then Abram removed his tent and came
[9:06] and dwelt in the plain of memory which
[9:08] is in Hein and built there an altar unto
[9:11] the
[9:13] Lord
[9:16] now Abraham
[9:20] realized he's got he's got all these
[9:23] blessings you realize that he needed an
[9:25] air he needed because if you what's
[9:28] going to happen if Abraham dies the the
[9:31] promises are just
[9:33] um they stop at Abraham and uh I'll just
[9:37] read Romans
[9:39] 816117 the spirit itself beareth witness
[9:42] with our spirit that we are the children
[9:45] of God and if children then HS HS of God
[9:49] and join HS with Christ if so be that we
[9:51] suffer with him that we may be also
[9:53] glorified together so if you are a child
[9:56] you get everything that's promised to
[9:58] your father
[9:59] and because we're children of God we get
[10:01] all of the promises that he he promised
[10:03] to us so this is this is where we're
[10:07] going with
[10:09] uh let's go to Genesis chapter
[10:14] 15 where Abraham was promised a
[10:27] son after these things me the word of
[10:30] the Lord came unto Abraham in a vision
[10:33] saying fear not
[10:35] Abram I am thy shield and I exceeding
[10:37] great
[10:41] reward his name is still
[10:53] AEL and Abram said Lord God what will
[10:56] thou give me seeing I go childless and
[10:59] the steward of my house is this Eleazar
[11:01] of Damascus he's looking for an air to
[11:05] pass down the promises of
[11:07] God and Abram said behold to me thou
[11:10] Hast given no seed and lo one born in my
[11:14] house is mine
[11:16] a and behold the word of the Lord came
[11:18] unto him saying this shall not be thine
[11:22] air but he that shall come forth out of
[11:24] thine own
[11:26] bowels shall be thine air and he brought
[11:30] him forth a broad and said look now
[11:31] toward heaven and tell the Stars if thou
[11:35] be able to number them and he said unto
[11:37] him so shall thy see be now this is his
[11:40] spiritual Heritage he promised him his
[11:42] natural heritage that that the kingdoms
[11:44] of Israel and Judah and all of his his
[11:47] 12 sons now he's promised them a
[11:50] spiritual Heritage that's not flesh and
[11:53] blood remember we talked about Jacob's
[11:54] Ladder if you're part of that
[11:57] genealogy then you're part of the stars
[12:00] of Heaven that were promised to
[12:03] Abraham and he believed in the Lord and
[12:06] he counted it to him for
[12:09] righteousness and it's interesting that
[12:11] even in the Old Testament you're saved
[12:13] by faith if you if any anybody could
[12:15] come and offer a ox or a a sacrifice but
[12:19] unless you believed it had no meaning
[12:21] you had to first come like Abel remember
[12:23] we talked about Abel first belied what
[12:26] God promised him and then he came and B
[12:28] his sacrifice
[12:31] so Abraham believed in the Lord and it
[12:33] was counted to him for righteousness and
[12:36] he said unto him I am the Lord that
[12:37] brought thee out of er the Cales to give
[12:40] thee this land to inherit it and he said
[12:42] Lord God whereby shall I know that I
[12:45] shall inherit it and he said unto him
[12:48] take me an hepher of 3 years old and a
[12:51] sheot of 3 years old and a ram of 3
[12:55] years old and a turtle dove and a young
[12:58] pigon
[12:59] and he took un him all these and divided
[13:01] them in the midst and laid each piece
[13:04] one against another but the birds
[13:06] divided he
[13:08] not and when the fouls came down upon
[13:11] the carcasses Abram drove them away and
[13:14] when the sun was going down a deep Sleek
[13:16] fell upon Abram a Lo of horror of great
[13:19] Darkness fell upon him now later on
[13:23] we're going to see how Jacob wanted to
[13:25] he you know he when we get to Jacob
[13:27] we'll look at how he took the birthright
[13:29] from Esau but that wasn't enough and he
[13:32] had to get the blessing from his from
[13:33] his dad that wasn't enough he had then
[13:36] he went and wrestled with the angel and
[13:38] confirmed the promise so this is what AB
[13:41] Abraham's like I know you promised to me
[13:43] but confirm it I want to I want
[13:46] something real I want a real experience
[13:49] it
[13:50] does so this
[13:52] is so let's uh take a look
[13:56] at um what the sacrifice means he
[14:00] sacrificed a hepher and a sheo and a
[14:04] ram and a hepher is a is a young female
[14:08] cow that's never born a calf fresh in
[14:10] its life it's it's got its youthful
[14:14] beiger when I think about how this
[14:16] applies to Christ how God how Christ
[14:18] ministered on the earth for three for
[14:19] three years she go to three years
[14:22] represents a sin offering and the ram is
[14:25] uh usually represented in scripture as
[14:27] consecrates consecrated
[14:30] um and he God split the animals into two
[14:34] dispensations but he didn't split the
[14:36] turtle
[14:37] do because all down through scripture
[14:41] the turtle does represent healing and
[14:43] healing remain to unchange through the
[14:45] Old Testament and the New Testament
[14:47] through both
[14:49] covenants if there was if the old
[14:52] Covenant had toine healing now this is a
[14:55] good thought how much greater should the
[14:57] New Testament the new New Covenant of
[14:59] divine
[15:00] heing in Jehovah Gyra uh 1964 brother R
[15:05] said what God was showing there he was
[15:07] doing that God himself was coming down
[15:10] to be made flesh and he was going to be
[15:13] in the Covenant and God took Christ the
[15:15] spirit god Jehovah took Christ at on the
[15:18] cross and he tore him into two he ripped
[15:21] out his soul and set it on high and took
[15:24] the body and put it in the grave and
[15:26] lifted up the body in the morning of the
[15:28] the resurrection and sent back the
[15:30] spirit that was upon him to be on the
[15:32] church that the same confirmation in
[15:34] this last days Jesus Christ the same
[15:36] yesterday today and forever with that
[15:39] same Covenant would have to be in the
[15:41] people now remember brother Brandon
[15:43] preached in matching pieces and a lot of
[15:45] different sermons about how the and they
[15:47] would make a covenant by riding on
[15:50] parchment the the terms of the Covenant
[15:53] and then tear it at a half and one would
[15:54] take one half and the other would take
[15:55] the other and you had to bring it they
[15:57] the matching the pieces had to match and
[16:00] remember Jacob's Ladder uh Christ
[16:03] sacrific at the bottom anchored at the
[16:05] bottom in the temple of God at the top
[16:07] and if you part of Christ at the bottom
[16:09] you match with with uh with with the
[16:12] soul of God you got what's inside of you
[16:15] has to match and that's what these two
[16:18] tearing apart these two covenants
[16:19] represent that you got it's matching
[16:22] pieces he ripped out his soul and set it
[16:25] on high and took the body and put it in
[16:26] the grave and lifted up the body in the
[16:28] morning morning of the resurrection and
[16:30] sent back the spirit that was upon him
[16:31] to be on the
[16:33] church let's see
[16:36] where and the f verse 11 and when the
[16:39] fouls came down upon the carcasses Abram
[16:42] drove them away now think about this
[16:44] Abraham's offered his
[16:47] sacrifice he's done what God has
[16:50] required him to do now just like Abel
[16:53] waited for the for God to come down and
[16:55] consume the sacrifice to accept it
[16:57] Abraham's waiting on on God to do
[16:59] something and he doesn't know exactly
[17:01] what's going to happen but he's going to
[17:04] keep everything in line he's going to
[17:07] live a Sanctified life to make sure that
[17:10] everything's lined up just right so that
[17:12] when when it comes time for the Covenant
[17:14] to be made manifest then it'll there
[17:17] won't be anything in the
[17:18] way so he drove away all the fouls
[17:22] anything that would deprive anything
[17:24] that would take little bits away from
[17:26] the sacrifice he kept it clear clean up
[17:28] all the little fouls and things that
[17:30] would
[17:31] come and
[17:33] spoil the whole
[17:36] situation and when the sun was going
[17:38] down a deep sleep fell upon Abram and
[17:41] low and horror of great Darkness fell
[17:43] upon him remember we were talking about
[17:45] Jacob laying down on that stone and God
[17:47] put him to sleep because God's got to
[17:51] get you out of the way before he can do
[17:53] something and this deep sleep
[17:55] represents the the death that faces
[17:57] every person
[18:02] person and he put Abraham into a deep
[18:05] sleep to show that Abraham hadn't do
[18:07] didn't have anything to do with God's
[18:09] Vindication he didn't have anything to
[18:11] do with it nothing nothing good in
[18:13] himself nothing good in any of
[18:15] us that we could take glory in is
[18:18] completely a work of the Holy
[18:22] Spirit and then the smoking furnace uh
[18:27] see got
[18:32] the smoking furnace types
[18:35] hell that every sinner deserves to go to
[18:39] hell it Al also represents in in
[18:41] Jeremiah 11 uh
[18:44] God Jeremiah prophesied say thou unto
[18:47] them thus sayith the Lord God of Israel
[18:48] cursed be the man that obeyeth not the
[18:50] words of this Covenant which I commanded
[18:52] your fathers in the day that I brought
[18:54] them forth out of the land of Egypt from
[18:56] the iron furnace saying obey my voice
[18:58] voice and do them according to all which
[18:59] I command you so Israel went through a
[19:02] furnace before they were brought forth
[19:04] into God's promises brought forth into
[19:06] the land of
[19:10] promise but every believer is supposed
[19:14] to every uh every sinner deserves to go
[19:17] to hell and facing that Smoky furnace
[19:20] but then came the burning
[19:24] lamb which
[19:26] represents God confir his Covenant and
[19:29] Jehovah G 1956 he says so death comes
[19:32] first then hell was the next the smoking
[19:35] furnace then he saw a burning lamp of
[19:37] light now watch and this lamp went
[19:40] between each one of those pieces making
[19:41] a covenant that God someday through the
[19:44] promised seed would raise up the Lord
[19:46] Jesus to confirm the Covenant with all
[19:48] the peoples of the earth which Abraham
[19:50] was a father of Nations remember the
[19:52] Covenant of many nations many nations
[19:55] naturally and many nations spiritually
[19:58] no notice he changed his name after that
[19:59] from Abram to Abraham now notice the
[20:03] Covenant uh and then he talks about the
[20:05] the the two
[20:07] halves so let's finish reading and he
[20:10] said let's see let's start at verse 12
[20:13] and when the sun was going down a deep
[20:14] sleep fell upon Abram and low and horror
[20:16] of great Darkness fell upon him and he
[20:19] said unto Abram know of assurity that
[20:21] thy seed shall be a stranger and a land
[20:24] that is not theirs and Shall Serve them
[20:26] and they shall afflict them 400 years
[20:29] and also that Nation whom they Shall
[20:31] Serve will I judge and afterward shall
[20:32] they come out with great substance and
[20:35] thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace
[20:36] thou shal be buried in a good old
[20:40] age but in the fourth generation they
[20:43] shall come hither again for the inequity
[20:45] of the amorites is not yet full and it
[20:47] came to pass that when the sun went down
[20:49] and it was dark Behold a smoking furnace
[20:51] and a burning lamp that passed between
[20:53] those pieces and the same day the Lord
[20:55] made a covenant with Abraham saying unto
[20:57] thy seed have I given this land from the
[21:00] river of Egypt unto the Great River the
[21:01] river Euphrates the kenites and the
[21:04] kenites and the cites and the Hittites
[21:06] and the perizzites and the Rams and the
[21:07] amorites and the Canaanites and the
[21:09] gites and the jeites so God confirmed
[21:12] his Covenant with
[21:13] Abraham
[21:16] supernaturally
[21:27] now we're going to go to
[21:32] Genesis
[21:45] 17 I think U hold on just a
[21:54] second my printer uh printed out my
[21:56] pages in
[22:23] work so then we're going to look at
[22:26] ishmail that's that's verse 16 is
[22:29] ishmail was born and
[22:42] um let's go ahead and look at verse
[22:45] chapter
[22:48] 17 tell that kind of talks about uh
[22:52] Ishmael there's a reason Ishmael
[22:54] couldn't be
[22:55] chosen so in Genesis chap 18 it's
[22:58] chapter 17 Abraham's 90 years old he's
[23:01] he's childless U and and I know we've
[23:04] all heard this before but remember the
[23:06] the parable ma in Matthew that Jesus
[23:08] told of the good Steward that had in his
[23:10] treasure box he had new things and old
[23:12] things so even though you might have
[23:14] heard before still part of the treasure
[23:16] box
[23:19] um and when Abraham was 90 Abram was 90
[23:23] years old in nine the Lord appeared to
[23:25] Abram and said unto him I am the
[23:28] almighty God walk before me and be thou
[23:30] perfect and I will make my Covenant
[23:32] between me and thee and will multiply
[23:34] thee
[23:37] exceedingly and Abram fell on this is
[23:39] again the Covenant of many nations he's
[23:41] going to
[23:42] multiply uh and Abram fell on his face
[23:45] and God talked with him
[23:46] saying as for
[23:49] me behold my Covenant is with thee and
[23:52] thou shalt be a father of many nations
[23:55] neither shall thy name anymore be called
[23:58] Abram by thy name shall be Abraham for a
[24:02] father of many nations have I made
[24:05] thee and I will make thee exceeding
[24:08] fruitful and I will make Nations out of
[24:10] thee and Kings shall come out of thee
[24:12] and I will establish my Covenant between
[24:14] me and thee and I seed after thee and
[24:16] their generations for an everlasting
[24:21] coverer to be a god unto thee and to thy
[24:24] seed after thee and I will give unto
[24:27] thee and to thy seed after thee the land
[24:28] wherein thou art a stranger all the land
[24:31] for Canaan for an everlasting possession
[24:33] and I will be their God and God said
[24:36] unto Abraham Thou shalt keep my Covenant
[24:40] therefore thou and thy seed after thee
[24:42] in their Generations this is my Covenant
[24:44] which he shall be between me and you and
[24:46] thy seed after thee every Manchild among
[24:49] you shall be circumcised and ye shall
[24:51] circumcise the Flesh of your foreskin it
[24:54] shall be a token of the Covenant between
[24:56] me and you and he that is 8 days old
[24:59] shall be circumcised among you every
[25:02] Manchild in your Generations he that is
[25:04] born in the house or bought with money
[25:06] of any stranger which is not of thy seed
[25:08] he that is born in thine house and he
[25:10] that is bought with thy money must needs
[25:12] be circumcised and my Covenant shall be
[25:15] in your flesh for an Everlasting
[25:17] Covenant and the uncircumcised Manchild
[25:20] whose flesh of his foreskin is not
[25:21] circumcised that Soul shall be cut off
[25:24] from his people he have broken my
[25:26] Covenant the uncondition Covenant
[25:28] requires
[25:29] circumcision you can't just take any any
[25:32] person off the street and say they're uh
[25:33] they're going to be part of this
[25:34] unconditional Covenant you must be
[25:36] filled with the Holy Ghost that the the
[25:38] new this New Covenant requires
[25:40] circumcision in the heart so you got to
[25:43] be part of the part of you got to be
[25:45] circumcised in the heart be part of the
[25:47] unconditional
[25:48] Covenant so Abraham's 90 he doesn't have
[25:52] any
[25:56] children
[25:58] and God promises he changes his name
[26:00] from Abram to
[26:02] Abraham he promises not just one nation
[26:05] but many nations so if God fulfills This
[26:08] Promise then you can take by the New
[26:10] Birth the spiritual the spiritual
[26:12] promise then people from nations from
[26:15] all around the world can stand beside
[26:18] the natural children of Israel and say I
[26:21] have Abraham to my father
[26:23] also because you're it's a promise to
[26:26] many nations Kings shall come out of the
[26:29] he's going to establish a kingdom A N A
[26:32] kingdom of Kings and Priests that we can
[26:34] go behind the
[26:36] veil and a
[26:38] natural that there's going to be if
[26:40] we're going to look down through Matthew
[26:42] the genealogy all the kings an unbroken
[26:46] lineage not like the if you look at the
[26:49] uh the genealogy of Judah the uh the
[26:53] generations of all the kings is
[26:54] completely unbroken father son father
[26:56] son but if you look at the genealogy of
[26:59] Israel and there's eight different
[27:02] uh uh groups of families so it's it's
[27:06] broken in lots of different places but
[27:08] not so with the genealogy of Judah
[27:10] because God promised a n natural that
[27:13] Kings would comes out come out of thee
[27:15] to be a god unto thee and thy seed after
[27:18] thee the promise of the land of Canaan
[27:20] to Abraham and his seed an everlasting
[27:22] Bond of Poss not just ownership but you
[27:25] you possess as yours uh we talk about
[27:28] NAB Vineyard God forbid that somebody
[27:30] would take that from him and brother Ram
[27:32] said about the unconditional Covenant in
[27:34] brass serpent
[27:37] 1953 and he tore the life out of Christ
[27:40] he took the body and set it on his right
[27:42] hand and sent the Holy Ghost back to the
[27:44] church which is the unconditional
[27:45] Covenant given to man tonight brother
[27:48] the life of Jesus Christ must be in
[27:49] every individual that's God's covenant
[27:53] and as sure as you're born of the spirit
[27:55] of God the Holy Ghost in you God is
[27:57] under one statement that he to raise you
[28:00] up in the last days he'll heal the
[28:03] sickness and uh I I've been having a
[28:06] wonderful time looking at all the
[28:07] promises and the birth right because um
[28:09] there's some there's some good stuff
[28:12] here
[28:15] um so
[28:18] then almost out of
[28:26] time
[28:34] you have eight
[28:39] minutes Well I this is this is probably
[28:41] a good stoping place so I'll go ahead
[28:43] stop here straighten out my nose for
[28:46] next
[28:56] time
[29:00] you
