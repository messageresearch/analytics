TRANSCRIPT
========================================
yeah there's be here this morning good to good to have both sister Daniella with us I said brother Matthew yeah but if you saying you you've not seen Matthew bless your hearts nothing all right we're all Hebrews he's got that Hebrews 11 and our Hebrew series we got to Hebrews 11 24 last week we were talking about my faith Joseph when he died didn't want to leave his bones and either he wanted them take them to Israel but he knew that's where the resurrection on them and we were talking about the journey of faith because faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen because you don't have to have faith that you're going to get to church this morning you're here your faith was when you got in the car or got started getting ready or some of us that are older just getting up and the deans and the yellow light come on and the dashboard the yellow light insanely okay all right so by faith each person there was a faith journey and there's a faith journey that you listen we're don't know how we're gonna need faith after a body Jani when we need faith for and Jesus walked in a world of perfect faith if he don't have enough faith he already knew he didn't have to faith he was gonna rain glabrous he just knew who he was because what God had done showed you my vision four days early and I see that's where you can have confidence when you see something we'll see we say well I think you say well I've never seen a vision I think about this other day I've never seen a vision but this word of God is to be this is what we've got this is what we've got to see is that the Word of God in the vision is the vision God had before the foundation of the world and now you and I are what fulfilling the vision well what's our part full veiled and we were talking about last night what's that vision it's fulfil for the Gentiles God moved to the Jews and then from the Jews we go into the Millennium together well it's still partial revelation partial vision for others but now for me and you when we take a rapture we've already we're no more we don't need Redemption anymore an infant over I mean what more is your guy do you have a lot of change but still the world's gotta catch up to us though the world's not totally 144,000 have to be redeemed v fields you all those different ones have to be redeemed and then in Millennium there's a little time of rest a thousand years where we all rest alright then you got to watch going judgment which redemption is continuing into the white throne judgment because they will be redemption given to people blueish virgin couple water my name and all those different one their journey will end when they get into the future home because brother rounds at time will blend into eternity so time is going to actually continue on to until the future home but remember the millennium is in your seventh day it's not an eighth day manifestation it's still in what we would call time or the seventh Church age number seven churches ends because of the Gentiles it ends for us when we go in after don't worry about that but time continue dawn if somebody's going to literally live 1,000 years to prove the sin curse has been done away with so there's going to be 24 hours but remember this is just my thought it's not going to be 365 on the fork we're not gonna have week years in the Millennium no it goes back to 360 days that's what you have to count everything as is your calendar of 360 days as the world comes back up because remember the way the world was knocked out of kilter was to play bad and brother Graham said you know could be an atomic explosion because man is always destroyed himself well what if the Battle of Armageddon is going to be where it reverses it back standing back devil because we're going to be under 360 day year from then on okay the prophets are going to prophesy 1260 days there's no calendar that they're going to go live for 1260 days it's going to be 30 days two months twelve hundred and 60 consecutive days but we have faith for that we don't have to we don't have to I guess man has went crazy said well I gotta have faith for this and have faith for that there has to come a time where you have an assured II it says by faith in other words are three faith through faith is a journey you go through faith because remember what happened right here by faith by faith by faith by faith by faith and you get to these died in faith even Sarah went through faith through faith not by faith through faith all right Sarah which is time to the bride a comfortable woman a so by faith Moses when he was born within three months of his family because he started the proper childhood they were not afraid of the Kings commandment by faith Moses when he was come to years refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter as we were talking last night with the youth mother did mother have a lot to do with his journey because she kept telling him you're not the son of Pharaoh's daughter you're born to be a leader you're born to be this so she by her connection to Moses he gave him a chance or an opportunity and then and then Moses wrote a third of the Old Testament and for surety Moses one of the greatest prophets that ever lived she wants to bring this to a point then you go over in the New Testament are the the book of Matthew in there where parodia raised her daughter and she told her to go dance in front of the in front of Herod and I don't believe it was just a Texas two-step it was something very sensual and BC what a main so what that caused was though it's for Herod to cut the head off of John the Baptist well now that woman raised her daughter go to hell this woman raised her son to be a great prophet that's what I was talking about last night so message message parents we do the best we can but you really need to the Bible says when they're older they'll not depart from it right so you instill these things in them when they're young by faith Moses when he was come to years refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of God and to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures needed for he had respect unto the recompense of the reward the wall is his reward his reward and he could have stayed in each of them indicating been the Pharaoh he was in line he could do that I mean but it would have been a temporal thing it was been for a season and I'm sure Moses looks and sees all these pharaohs and everybody's trying to kill Pharaoh I mean you know you've got all the people around him in and they don't last very long sometimes unless they go unless they kill everybody all their people around him so today he figured that that he'd rather just stay in to what he was in that mother told him you're going to be a leader you're gonna be the one to do this you're gonna be the one going to take you out with a mighty hand by faith he forsook what the world did not fearing the wrath of the King for he endured as seeing him who is invisible now watch through faith he kept the Passover the sprinkling the blood less than he destroyed the first that blessed that heat that destroyed the firstborn should touch them so terrific he had to believe what God said go kill the lamb everybody get inside put ain't baby girl hey put the blood on the doorpost and see you have to believe that but what you do is you believe for that manifestation because the manifestation was they heard the cry of all the firstborn in Egypt all the cattle and all everything that went covered under the blood died so Moses through faith he kept the Passover the sprinkling blood lest he that destroyed the firstborn should touch them by faith that passed through the Red Sea and by dry land now look I want you to see something here by faith they passed through the Red Sea and by dry land now who's they that's the whole of Israel but now reach Philo they come up to the Red Sea they turn around to Moses and saying why have you brought us out here tonight someone had to come on the scene that had faith remember brother Browns preachers wanna cry speak write because Moses began to cry all right there's this really in faith there's no crying you need to speak and go forward by faith because faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen so the evidence was that they got across the Red Sea on dry land the faith they had they had in Moses and Moses put his a shirt in what God already said that's what he said back up here Moses right here he forsook Egypt not fearing the wrath of the King for he endured as seeing him who is invisible through faith he kept the Passover he was he was going to lead the people out same way with them the children of Israel were Jewish just like meeting you we murmur and complain we come up against the wall and what's the first thing the crowd and dog why understand me in this direction why you know what who are we to tell a creator this is the wrong way but remember God's no nor the best yes is you'll ever get all right 20 wait 20 said seeing him hey hey that pain didn't have time faith if the man was standing in front of me he had faint listen these people had faith that's why they're called the this the faith chapter is listening you and I have seen God move through a prophet we've seen the Word of God we've seen moving on life Moses and Abraham just heard somebody talking to it they heard somebody talking bill now how many times has somebody talked to you and I'll be good a thousand a day but then you come up to one person Abraham ins Abraham sitting in his recliner and you know he feeling pretty good and all of a sudden he hears this voice it says get up move and he does why because he chose the right one same way with Moses he never saw he never saw God until they were in their journey remember he remember he saw the backside of the man I want to see you wailed down here packed into journey it's when he really saw God so he was believing God never show this stuff to composes at this point in time he showed him to him in the journey he showed his stuff in the journey but Moses believed so much in what remember let's go back to what his mother his mother taught him to believe in the invisible and that's the same way with you and I we should teach their kids to believe in the supernatural supernatural invisible right right so as seeing him who is invisible become what God Christ whatever you want Christ through the Old Testament Joba that was who he's talking about my fate they pass through the Red Sea is my growl in which the Egyptians are saved to do we're ground by faith the walls of Jericho fell after they will compassed about seven days and then we have to include right here by faith Rahab the harlot perished not with them that believed not when she received the spies with peace now then you go back to what I was talking about the other day what a great show of sanctification Rahab was not pure woman by no means she was she was well known in the community in all of Jericho I'm certain now why God picked her because she had faith she was part of the thing she believed the two spies come in and they said okay if you'll stay right here run the red rope down because you have helped us escape we'll give you you know Whittle in other words we'll let you live of course it was the plan had gone all the way long because Here I am you got Rahab marries an Israeli general who had though they had to that guest he who has Damon so really whose lineage come through that prosecuting campaign which in the water really good winnings comes through this prostitute because that's what we were we were all robbing hips we were prostitutes to drinking and smoking and cussing and gamblin and all the other things that's what we were prosecutor daddy but by faith the harlot Rahab perished not within the believe not when she had received the spies with peace and then it stops and then they put a bunch of them together and what shall I more say for the time when fail me to tell of gideon barak samson objected on David Samuel and of the prophets who through faith subdued kingdoms wrought righteousness obtained promises stopped the mouths of lions quenched the violence of fire escaped the edge of the sword out of weakness were made strong that get in waxed valiant in fight turned to flight the armies of the aliens I was reading and neither can't they it was second Kings where the army was outnumbered like 25 to 30 the woman and whoever the problem was at the time I can't really remember the King comes to him and says what are we going to do and prophet said well let me go talk to God in other words I'll go see what's going on he said I'll don't worry he's going into battle said the battle juror you win the battle when I baby let me tell you that be hard to get to the end infant treatment it went so hard to get into the general or the one or the King to under to a snit but when you go down and tell your army of 300 that there's 3,000 men down here in this field and you're going to destroy every one of them you really have to complain that you want why am I saying that because it's like we talked about the fivefold ministry the fivefold ministry has to get the revelation first and then we have to convey it to you that you don't don't have faith in us you have faith in what we stay you know faith and what said if we bring you the Word of God you have faith in the Word of God but we were talking about that was not about brother Branham you know he said he said you know he said when he was talking about them the race war where you know they died like flies and debt is going being come he said that one he said now what does that the Lord that was me he said you got a watch you got to be careful and watching a lot of things that even prophets say they just be careful of it a lot of it is human human thoughts but when they bring you the Word of God face final resting places then this word you can take it back to this work of God you can be a sure or have faith that remember a prophet is a divine revealer of the word now he doesn't reveal it to you he came from Billington but he makes it so plain and simple to wear that childlike simple faith reacts back and says they ain't nothing but the truth just like hey derived it Dino that's true and you have to say that when you do that God has to honor that but you bring it together right because what happened is God can't honor falsework he can't honor anything false he has to honor his word cyber arrested called caught on the scene all right call caught on the same telling you did everything you're supposed to do and if you don't do what you what he's supposed to do you can call him a liar now that's pretty strong but you better make sure you do everything he thinks you're supposed to right down the line right because you get in trouble - God doesn't then women received their dead raised to life again and others were tortured not accepting deliverance thinking I'm trying to think back again well there was one battle there was I can't remember there was like ten thousand men in this one battle and they were the enemy and there was a child ends I think then they came up cuz I'm reading Jeremiah they came up to battle Judah to not do to himself but Jude and Kingdom and God told whoever lusts and does the Jeremiah I guess in Tulsa don't worry don't worry the battles yours don't worry about it they get up the next morning and God has sent the death angel to count killed everyone killed a whole army up the whole enemy they're just laying up their data all right and you got to help and says don't get the spoil over the land and get all this stuff you know because the gods come too and he just killed everyone up that's kind of God never have full solar women received their dead raised to live the end others were tortured not accepting deliverance that they might obtain a better resurrection and the others had triumph of cruel walking scourging yeah moreover of bonds and imprisonment they were stoned they were sawn asunder remember Isaiah they cut him in pieces tempted were slain with the story they wondered about sheepskin goat skin being destitute afflicted tormented hello I love what Paul interpolates Paul interpolates here with the parenthesis of whom the world was not worthy the world wasn't worthy for them people they only even though they are the Great Hall of faith leaders this world what need worthy for them to do what they did but they were put in here for what our example they wandered in deserts and in mountains and in dens in case of the earth now look here's the whole point and these all having obtained a good report or testimony through faith received not the promise what's the promise thanks to 38 right does the promise is to your children right the baptism of the Holy Ghost they never receive the promise listen when God when God speed and genesis 3:15 his promise was I'm going to sin I'm going to send myself and I'm going to be the state of the woman and I'm gonna make this thing come right back together that's a promise but not just the comments Jehovah and like you said you know that he thought you gotta fought their army or any their battle sometimes too and God will fight yours if you let him but they still some you got five right fit because they obtained to do report through faith received not the promise the promise was is that you've got Adam and Eve standing here and they fell and God wanted to give eternal life to everybody bring the bride forth and bring them the ones that were that works of now eternal life in their soul there's no way they could do that in the Old Testament not happening so what was the promise the promise is I'll be with you even in you to the end of the world that's what God won't he don't want to live with us it's okay did he was dead he lives with us he lived with the children of Israel but he always wanted to well inside of them he always wanted well end people not just with people so they never received the baptism of the Holy Ghost of their soul sure they're going to be back they're going to be eternal sure they're gonna be be there but you know what they're not right I read you in Jeremiah last 90 babe they lost their bride ship dog had to put them away go but I had to put them away for what they did but he can't restore them back to wipe again because the grounds polluted we read that remember the grounds polluted you can't take the wife back after she's been polluted but it doesn't mean you have to kill her either no he made some he brings another forty one thousand then he's going to bring all these Old Testament Saints and you know what to be truthful they're not gonna get to live in the city that would come like that last night about who lived in the city and who lives outside the city they're going to live outside the city only in the bride and the 144,000 living inside of that city now they're not included in them even the great Moses I'm sure you've got your you've got your Twelve Apostles in your 12 patriarchs but there's nowhere that they get what we get and they've lost that position but don't talk so much it's just one this is the hall of faith listen we should have way more surety than they did we've been taught we've got Bible we've got message books we've got all this different information Abraham was just sitting down one day and his recliner like I said working for his father-in-law making idols and making a good living and all of a sudden somebody said says hey bro you need to come and go in a different direction you need to give up and follow me how many times the left minute old here you know many times you say well what do you mean and he had nothing to check it with they've been they have nothing to check it with in everything do you have nothing even have nothing Moses Moses had his mama his mama doctor his mama was telling him hey we're gonna do this we're going to do that right but now you and I'm brother Brown says many times he said he said we live way more privileges why because you see the great miracles that happen in the Old Testament under the blood of bulls and goats done anointing people but now he's not an anointing people today if you're born again you are the anointing yeah you are the promised why says God having provided some better thing for us that they without us should not be made perfect now as I've Illustrated many times before as Paul is speaking this they were these people back here Paul was standing here in the New Testament just started during Paul's time you know you test them at what noon when Jesus was here if when Paul and Peter when the Holy Ghost fell on their Pentecost acts when to Turkey's church they started back when that's when the New Testament started Friday he's standing there though saying better thing for us that day he looks back all the way back to Adam they without us cannot be made perfect when I when Paul got his head chopped off he became a leg he's not at us anymore these are they so now we're standing over here at the end of the church age is looking back to Paul through Paul back to Adam and they're waiting on us because they without us should not be made perfect but this us is going to end it all there's not another one coming it's gonna be perfect it's just gonna be us so that us Paul was prophesied but until he died he wasn't us he was living the he was living the promise by having some better thing for us that they without us should not be made perfect or apart from we will read that and then perfect I think that means complete yes because there was no completion in Paul's day you still have you still had your sure it in the soul he was born again no doubt but he didn't have he was actually the seals what he didn't know what to seal was remember I told you all the other day and it kind of shocked him Paul was already dead he never knew that John went to Patmos your honor went that was in the night in the 1890's wall was killed in maybe 15 66 Paul never heard of a seal when he preached all about it by revelation he didn't know what to call it so he preached but he didn't know what still one was still to us feel free well he's already gone even dead nor it in another dimension but who that for though that was for us to see it John topped the bride and if we now watch remember chapters are put in by man not by God this is the letter to the Hebrews Paul is writing a letter to the Hebrews hmm watch his last off dot having provided some better thing for us that they without us you we made perfect don't lose you talk because he keeps writing we're for seeing that we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses let us cannot leave in perfect let us lay aside every weight and the sin which doth so easily beset us and let us run with patience the race that is set before us looking unto Jesus not looking back to them to the to the once goes right here's where the promise came from the promise didn't come from the Old Testament the problem did come from baracan and David and all the promise came from Jesus Christ Nepal is bringing an updated revelation that we gotta look into Jesus the author and finisher of our faith who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross despising the shame and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God the words of throne of God now on heaven than you right for consider him that endured such contradiction of sinners against himself lest ye be wearied and faint in your minds for consider him that endured such contradiction Jesus Christ of sinners against him lest ye be wearied and faint in your mind another words don't worry about what these people are saying you have not yet resisted unto blood striving against sin and he have forgotten the exhortation which speaketh unto you as unto children my son is five knock down the chastisement of the Lord nor faint when they are they are rebuked of him for whom the Lord loveth he chasing the point is competent this whole dissertation is for this one for this one burst from them the Lord loveth he chastens and scourges every son and me receive us like I said yesterday you can't have a testimony without having a test first got how the test the first four letters of testimony or tdst there you got out there before all right they don't forget all these people in the Old Testament the Paul brands that revelation up to Jesus endured such contradiction you need to endure such contradiction and you have not yet resisted unto blood in other words you guys hadn't died for what you believed in yeah now he knew he was maybe later on but he probably didn't when he was right deep breath striving against sin and you have forgotten the exhortation which speaketh unto you as unto children my son despise not down to chastisement texting of the Lord nor faint when they art rebuke to him for whom the Lord loveth he chasing it go Maggie was telling them story about something that he had done in and the Lord led him out for about three weeks over something and and then he brought him the revelation of what was going on well you know I said well brother Matthew I said he wasn't done that if you weren't a child they want they've done that they wouldn't went after you and lets you steal over it for a few weeks and then brand-new revelation and then know that you won't use it he brought that so you can use it I ain't David for a testimony if you endure chastening God dealeth with you as with sons for what son is he whom the father chasing them not but if you be without chastisement where for all are partakers then are ye bastards if not sunk free hard words there Paul illegitimate you and you know what that's the truth if you're not a son of God you're really gentlemen you there's a lot of illegitimate Christians out there they they're not sons and daughters of God they just try to stay in the family because remember an illegitimate child is part of the family somebody's somewhere there's a genetic connection between an illegitimate child they just weren't born in the right way that same way with the born-again work if you're not born again the right way but remember brother Graham says this Brides brides churches Brides but there's gonna come one and we are standing in the one which will be sons and daughters we've done furthermore we have had fathers of our flesh which corrected us and we gave them reverence shall we not much rather be in subjection unto the father of spirits and live in other words the heavenly father for they barely for a few days chastened us after their own pleasure but he for our profit that we might be protective of : is just what I said the chastisement is a test and the test is what we have to go through that we can come back and tell others you know they go do the same thing now no chastening for the present seemeth to be joyous there is no time you go through a test that you say thank God but now afterwards you look back and say thank God if you going to a test I mean you you you you do a lot of battling don't you right but when you get to the end of it and God brings you something strong and this revelation or or tells you where you are well that just it's like woman it's like a woman having a child the pain is real but your sisters don't dwell them well boy when I had you know you know boy when I had Josh at 2:04 in the morning on April 4 20 whatever it was they need more make what they made of 22nd see you know everybody came down there yeah he said bad work to me man she wouldn't mean being late but you don't put your over it I mean you don't do I wanted you you don't even remember you should remember the payment he endured that same thing with it no chastening for the present seemeth to be joyous why you in other words why you're going through it's pretty painful but greediest nevertheless afterwards it yieldeth the peaceable fruit of righteousness why because you move into a place that you know your child to go cause if he don't and you made it through and you're a better person for it that is not the devil if it continues on for years that's the devil you know you're having but I don't like Matthew you know you know Matthew was talking about - whether you having some kind of problem or something he just he's the Lord I'm he's telling us the other night he said lord I know you can do this what is wrong with me whatever I got it at the birth make you be done wait but when he got oh yeah they back way back is hurt yeah I'm not hurting he's bad would kill him because that's the way it is you not have split headaches and get up preaching it go away but when you go back into and study you can hear they come back but he was like saying Lord no what am I done well you know I know this is right I know this is the Word of God but remember see if God gives you that instantly where's the text where's the where's the the time trial all right this is not a this is not a microwave doctrine this is like a crock pot you know they scroll cooking you know for slow and stay it won't be joyous and it won't because man how many times you why now when you get through the end of it you said man that was just for me that was my the buddy going through it you're like Lord where are you like Maxie said what I done right but nevertheless afterward it yieldeth the peaceable fruit of righteousness unto them which are exercised thereby in other words going through it do you know what sometimes you may have to go to a trial so that somebody else may not have to go through that trial because they can't handle it like you think you ever thought of that you'll go through something to help someone else and for you to tell that testimony because you're the stronger because God's not will put any more on you then you can endure right and you think man sometimes he puts us back to them right to the edge of it but we're still here but you may have to go do it because you can handle it and that sister or brother can handle it and you can tell that brother or sister a testimony of how God led you through it and the stupid thing you've done to get into it and maybe they'll go a different direction and see that's something they can't handle that you can handle I was telling the sister Norma Jeffries when brother of difference died she said I don't know how I can handle this I said noma I said if you're a child of God we know juniors fine I said but you know one thing's for sure Jim may not take it like you can take it I'm still here I said but he took junior knowing you can take it and you can handle it cuz it how else are you going to explain that you can explain it no other way is it that whoever that person is going through a trial they can take it and they can use it for good and sister Norma has done done fine she get hi everybody it's lonely I guess at times when you lose never never had that happen before but but if you do know one thing's for sure if you're a child a guy doc don't you just gonna say okay I'm gonna take your husband and you just out there you know fend for yourself no no it's not that way with these children anything you don't really any trial or tribulation you go through it is for your benefit and your training right so that you can show others and teach others so Joe Joe come down and ask could we come up a little bit early so or earlier so we're going to do that right here look we're for a lift up the hands which hang down it's really easy to do this but lift up your hands let's hang down into people needs and make straight paths for your feet less that which is lame be turned out of the way but let it rather be healed with reporting's Paulo peace with all men and holiness without which no man shall see the Lord will stop there let's go they're probably still in the sons do for your wife [Music] you know outfits around here in this
