18-1104 - The Book of Romans Pt.20 - Wade Dale
TRANSCRIPT
========================================
don't worry Romans 10 everybody had a good week yeah we pitched have a good weekend got brother Ernie with us and the next Sunday remembered brother Dale myself brother Donny will be in Kentucky I'll be preaching about the bollards next Sunday little Willie and we've got a 9-month kitchen acquaintance these sudden you got Bob both services next time then really so means me so we might get back Wayne see if we both all three kill something will probably make me a thief or church service so there's that and Louise's gonna do some screenings think something or I don't wanna go back there no we're coming back lanes they even and they not yes I gotta work those yes we're coming back winds even regardless of what we do look even if we get back at the midnight but I hopefully leave it's lunch and get back just pray the way up safe drips both go to snow Tuesday night so oh it may be a dull a oh I love it oh absolutely that's deer hunt good deer hunt you salmon you see them better they move all right this is chapter 10 verse 1 rather than my heart's desire and prayer to God for Israel is that they might be saved no we don't want things for sure he just standing on all April and April now we read that in chapter 9 we'll go back over here I'm going to do this but maybe if we find it we don't find this is fun okay you're going to be ready they know let's go to Israel there's a in Israel by birth there's an Israel by heart where Israel about modern there's a natural Israel but now listen to we got to bring this down because the next seal coming up which would be the fifth seal we have a natural Jew or natural Israel excuse me that's going to be given white roads it's not even safe right okay that's your fifth seal Jew all right and that's the part that yeah we got well we got to put it in you know the way to go so we put it in the way it goes it'll be fine that fifth seal is a wonderful steal and involved a couple of other liens denied sure we go up on the fourth seal after the fourth seal a man he's done but you got to take five six and seven and lap them back into number four right okay v Dixon seven seal has to be in that fourth seal to us now remember that's not to Israel because when we leave the two witnesses start their ministry according to the fifth seal we're reading and then the sixth seal is the two prophets - now remember the seventh seal is Christ himself so we have to get that Christ in the fourth seal because that's Christ himself coming back into Sunday ministry take us out of him but he's gonna also come to the Jews then he's also gonna come to the world he'd also wanna fight for the Jews Michael your prints will read all that when we get to it but there's not all Israel that's Israel so remember Israel my heart desire and prayer to God for Israel is that they might be saved because he's a Jew he wants his nation same but he knows he's not there not because he's going to eject off because of Romans nine we read as it is written behold our lands on a stumbling-stone a rock of offense a new favor believeth on him shall not be ashamed he talks about the Gentiles up here that the Gentiles which followed not after righteousness have attained to righteousness even the righteousness which is by faith all right so it Israel remember will be saved as a nation great yeah hundred forty four thousand boom Gentiles individuals it's always been individual well what's Paul doing here in Romans watch what he's doing for I bear them record that they have a zeal of God obviously they still have a deal of God they read the Torah they do their thing they're waiting wall they got even now hey but they missed the first coming of Christ so they're still working under the law right they're still working on the law keeping the feast days and all these things trying to get the temples that they're trying to get that temple worship back they're trying to get the red heifer they trying to get all these things back because it's repetition to the Jews it's just a repetition right but to Gentile there's not a repetition thing it's by faith we take it by faith that's what promotes that drama come on II last night the Bible study was asking about where Paul's talking about where tongues is not for the unbeliever coming for the believers for the unbeliever prophecies for the believer because I'm speaking to you speaking in tongues every day in your life and below you can speak in tongues everyday life and be born again and you don't do anything from person is lost yeah but if you talk to them about the Lord and give them save then signs do follow believer that's one thing about that's not the signs must follow the believer the signs are not to believe with history the signs are an unbelievable right from bear them record that they have a seal of God but not according to knowledge for they being ignorant of God's righteousness no they didn't know he came they didn't know anything about son of man they they you know he wasn't anything to them really and going about to establish their own righteousness what do the log do the Torah don't do this don't do that don't do this don't do that that's why I'm telling you we've made this messy iboga Ruth do this don't do that you can't do this you can't do that do this yeah what we made it we made it ten commandments of the message don't cut your hair you know don't don't wear pants no go man to have long hair but same thing and we've lived by that for years and it got us nowhere right no way you're just doing like Jesus said you're just painting the tomb that you got the dead prophets in and you do want to put them in there okay for they being ignorant of God's righteousness and going about to establish their own righteousness have not submitted themselves unto the righteousness of God see for Christ that's the whole problem they didn't know anything by Jesus Christ coming oh yeah something was there knew he was there but they just did man you know and all that but not the Messiah they didn't think it was a messiah for Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to everyone that look at that word believe ends up ongoing believe it Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to everyone that believeth how is he at the ends of the law to get born again you're not under the law if you're not born again you are under the law that says do this and don't do that but when you're a Christian you don't have one cuz look we're not we're not judged I've already went through what I went through all that you can't judge a Christian you can you touch my soul my soul is not just as eternal as done in theater yes what we were talking about last night the Bible study I want everybody to understand that we've got Jesus doing one thing and that's doing another we've become tunas we're not winning this and we're not chanting no that's wrong programs here but what about it in the middle in the middle growth around their brand so tunas right he brought true one with the starter next Brides in a multiple form but if you and I say well I know I have the I want to be like God I'll read your script for what Satan says he wants to be like daughter and this age he is like doc yeah he is like God he's our closest name to God brother Branson outside of creation he's just as equal to God he just can't create he can't create something he has to take something that's why the prefer go he takes what's already been created and perverts it yes right for Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to everyone that believe it now why did they say believe it thank you a perfect man and all these system remember when you first got born again you were illegal you were a law keeper just like I said you had the ten commandments of the message you know I won't give refrigerator thou shalt not thou shalt not thou shalt not go to denominations thou shall I cut your hair there seven right right but Christ is the end of the law for Reisman for every one day gone that keeps going every one that keeps going on why because now don't have to tell myself every day to keep my hair short I don't have to tell myself every day to go to church I don't have to tell Jeunet get up every morning now you make sure you don't put on a pair pants now let's see all that's that's law you know but that law has become righteousness if you keep it because we're the only people bless you they can keep the Ten Commandments you okay when you get close to 60 then paint remember our over 60 weight straight c'mon straight get the stricken in age she's well cooking tonight last night we had a conversation of well what was well stricken in age because I wonderful brother Lewis brought up the point that Elizabeth that Burke John the Baptist Bible says she was well stricken in age so we were wondering what well stricter than aid was I told him I said if you're 20 40 is well strict in the name if you're 40 60 is well stricter than age if your seats the 80th well thinking the name if you're 18 you're just gold I told my sister cleaning me in 92 you know what is she what she looking at to be welcome no she said I am well there's nobody to push it to once you get up in the 90 you know there's not many left yeah man told me one time he said oh he said I don't have any friends anymore after a while mr. Hodge he said well maybe for them all about the Christ at the end of the law for righteousness to everyone that believeth so it's an ongoing thing you keep going through to meet it to me to keep this message lined up there's no one you got your born-again a lot of times what happened this is we beat the flesh make put them under the ten commandments of a law of the message and we keep them there and then look what's happening now we've come through this journey this period of time and watch them how they're falling away well you can't have the Holy Ghost and fall away we can't read in Hebrews you can't you can't get the baptismal whole goes to lose it okay so you can't turn the message down I say I don't understand it you might get a spirit on you that like brother Ramsay but brother Brown you know where he went out and started drinking beer now let's see that's the spirit same thing with with suicides and stuff like that I'm glad we got a prophet they told us that all that separated we have a lot of spirit of soul your soul just as eternal as God you can't touch it it's not enough one day and down the neck but the Satan can get in that spirit realm give you a spirit and you can do a lot of things now you won't do it long if you won't be long that grantee guy did live with like six months brother Ron said God took him home so he wouldn't Mark's name why he's not going to continue unless somebody keep doing these things he's going to stop it yes to preserve the I have always said that when brother Branham when the angel told him said don't smoke drink or flew around with women because you have a work to do now listen he told all of us that I mean thank you less right to do it him not know but God was protecting not William Branham he was protecting the gift that he had because if not he was a respecter of persons he was not a respected person he come to each one of us listen we all get convicted don't smoke don't drink don't fool around women listen we've all kind of got in that terrible category somewhere along the line so and we could have turned it down just like he did but God was protecting that gift that William Brown had that he could take it to the nation's and be safe here and clean ain't still center okay but he protected the gift from Moses described as the righteousness which is of the law in commandment that the man which do it those things shall live by them but the righteousness which is the faith speaketh on this wise saying not in thine heart who shall ascend from heaven that is to bring Christ down from above because truly the 10 commandments didn't bring Christ to the people I'm from Israel no it did brother brown said that was godly reform but what they do they said no we don't want that we want Moses to talk to the Train okay okay that is to bring Christ down from above or this yo this end in the deep that is to bring up Christ again from the dead but what saith in the word is nigh thee even in thy mouth and the heart that is the Word of Faith which we preach so that's where it is that if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus and shalt believe in thine heart that God had raised him from the dead thou shalt be saved now they had nothing to do with the law Doosan don't if you're waiting to get good enough to get saves you know the whole thing the devil says you ain't doing them that's the first thing you'll take first thing you told me you're not good another thing and you know what I agreed with it that's right and I came home to church you got rid of my greed I said no I'm not right I said but saying you can't stop me from being saying I stopped myself thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus and shalt believe in thine heart that God raised him from the dead thou shalt be saved for with the heart man believeth unto righteousness raid justification is an act of righteousness but it's not total righteousness it's an act of the Holy Ghost but it's not the whole ago if you be justified every day in your life and I go hey you be sanctified every day and heal happened I go do you have the Holy Ghost on your spirit anointing you and I go to hell but you can't have it in your heart not this thing is your Center being your center self yes all right for with the heart man believeth unto righteousness because remember there's the paradox is that you're living in an unbelievable world shrinking that you can take that to waste an out the leaving world in an unbelievable world I mean we've come down to a place where brother joke told me that was a dog shot a man the other day well the doll was fooling around in the backseat of the drove me get the shotgun and went off and did we got Goss Tennessee good still he's still a good dog us he's a good shot I let him hide retreat but you see all the weird stuff is going on me we got a weird stuff happening everywhere because man's mind when the Bible said that it wasn't the days of Noah man's mind were what continually evil everybody's all got an angle now everybody man look at this the living I don't want to bring it up I'm going through for a second look at all this political junk is going on man they know you stood that Swingle mud at each other I'll shoot know that fire nuclear weapons with each other now let me there there you know your grandma was oh yeah but you know why is because man's that were built into something you and I are build and that's why I'm telling you you and I are building to something that's not part of this world you and I are building something here it's going to take us into another dimension and then they're just going you know what they program dog-eat-dog that's what's gonna happen this world is gonna be a pitiful place when there's no grace left when there's no grace left it's gonna be a pitiful place to be but we're trying to escape that for the heart with a heart the man believeth unto righteousness with the mouth confession is made unto salvation well the scripture saith whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed for there is no difference between the Jew and the Greek he's telling them there's no difference then you know what the Jews are doing they're standing there going he's our guy everybody else is going noise I rock no these don't know any harder ok but let God be God yes ok let God begun there's no different when using the Greek for the same lord over all is rich unto all that call upon him what's Paul trying to do he's trying to get that division out of the way so they think that come together just like you know you you shadow Paul's ministry and brother rounds ministry they pretty much all happened kind of the same because it was the awful Alpha prophet and brother Brennan was the Omega prophet you had your two in books that had to be basically the same Hall came with the independent office we brought as mentioned for the ramp Remington and penticoff brothers message how old struck down by a life brother Graham that last his whole life you know so we see these things that they're parallel so what's he doing now he's trying to bring them together brother branham really did trying to bring the Pentecostals and the baddest and the Methodists and bring them together not the way they wanted to come together that was the problem because that's why they cut him out come and walk to they wander this new doctrine that this probably because there was divisions back then I mean there wasn't denominations back then but there were divisions all the time I think it's wolves he said coming in for whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved how then shall they call on him and who have them they have not believed so there's got to be a believing that this Jesus did what he did you can't just say Jesus to these people that I've heard say that out of the world and it didn't have nothing to do with right right so there's not if you go wild all you gotta do is cry say labor geez no there's something behind that it's knowing who he is and what's behind all that then how shall they call on him and who they have not believed and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard and how shall they hear without a preacher all right and how shall they preach except they be simple there's a lot of stipulations going on here as it is written how beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace and bring glad tidings of good things but they have not all obeyed the gospel for Isaiah said Lord who has believed our report in other words it's not these unbelievers so then faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the Word of God but I say have they not heard question yes barely their sound went into all the earth and their words unto the ends of the world in other words the gospel is being preached the gospel is being put out there all over the world right I mean look at it now you say well you know 50 years ago it was pretty much brother branham's message home 7-inch real and absolutely you could not put him on that wall right there all 11 our sermons cuz it was 1100 and some of them had to some of that retail for one let spoken-word revision seating have like three tapes three of the big seven eight through training through whichever one one anyway what I'm saying is that would be hard to go into all the world wind but I got a whole message right oh my phone that does all these oh say thousands of things right so I can take the gospel and I even have the voice so I can say I can listen to it in this and I can take this all over the lid off you've been preached all over plus we got internet there words words unto the ends of the world we got in tape form we got in book form and sent all over the world but I say have they not heard yes better than they're selling all the earth into word from the end of the world but I say did not Israel no first Moses said I will provoke you to jealousy by them that are no people and by foolish nation I will anger you who was that that was he right right but Isaiah it's very bold and said I was found of them that sought me not i was made manifest unto them that asked not after me and what's he saying this is the gentile because listen the jews were looking for christ they were looking for the Messiah and there he is he came for him but I was found of them that sought me not Gentiles or the seeking Christ they worse didn't even know anything about God sending nobody to say I was made manifest unto them that asked not after me in other words what's Paul saying he's saying that I have come to talk to you Romans but you Romans been causing me to come tell you about this but I'm coming to bring you a gospel watching us in Israel he said all day long I am stretched forth my hands unto a disobedient and gainsaying people God is long-suffering because man look what Israel did according person looking for difficulty I say then hath God cast away his people god forbid he has not cast him away now he put him away he put him away he was married to Israel and he put them away and give him divorce man but he won't forget them watch Brian I also AM an Israelite of the seed of Abraham of the tribe of Benjamin now here comes Paul showing his natural image God hath not cast away his people though which he foreknew which is his peace children what you not that the scripture said of a lot how he maketh intercession to God against Israel saying Lord they have killed thy people and digged down thine altars and I am left alone and they seek my life now that was new Elijah he lies it's Elijah remember Elijah went back in the cable said God I'm the only one left then another person in the whole nation that's not bow down to this bale God gifting shows him 7,000 men go back in description read it Lord they've killed thy prophets and digged down thine altar and I have left alone and they seek my life but what saith the answer of God unto him I have reserved to myself seven thousand men God is always gonna have somebody even I think maybe brother Branham would standing though I'm alone because remember he always how I stood by myself then on the seals he really did go he said thousands of my friends and when he preached marriage and divorce he sent thousands of 1,000 to my friend will leave me and they did and he pretty much like Jesus he died alone everybody was against him there I mean he was preaching it to 50 thousand people and then he preached to 50 when he preached the rapture message in Yuma Arizona he was preaching in them in a house trailer was about 50 feet 30 to 50 people there and he preached the rapture message so what he did he I don't think brother Adam in his own self cut himself off from the people the people cut him off because they couldn't understand that doctrine and then they could they will turn that doctrine down that's right and brother Branham probably even right before he died he thought won the world my lord I'm out here all by myself he went to Arizona and said I've been out here for three years and not one person asked him to preach now I've been pretty rough you take somebody like William Brown these are being named I mean it my new name and in the fifties they couldn't pack enough to get a building big enough tents big enough to put him in he goes to Arizona till Leo comes got going and go to desert just like he told Moses to go there just like all the way to the day Jesus went to the devil all right he went out there and not one church asked him to preach in three years you know always have to come back though somewhere else or go to Jefferson felt brief so he thought he was alone but thank God I hope he left brother brown look over the banner of time and look down and see all the preachers now that are preaching the true message of the hour not the oh not the bad ones but the preaching the true message of the hour collect what he done with a lie these and now lie do you may look alone but I got 7,000 men that I have preserved that have not bowed the knee to the image available and that helped Elijah because the lines of the human man remember the Bible said the live in his black passion man like meeting you yeah all right so he had complexes like we have complex he was setting a period of ten in them and he was setting up there in that can going Lord what why do you want you I'm the only one left then another one they didn't all give this out to bill God coming self and said no I got I don't have their seven I don't have just 700 I got seven thousand men they have not been that Bowser need to bail so in other words they're out there condemning bail and preaching the gospel what we're saying this even so then at this present time also there is a remnant according to the election of grace no once he tell them it may look bad Paul are you the only one no same as that a remnant according to the election of grace and by grace then it is no more worse otherwise grace is no more grace right grace is not grace if you put words in it this way all right basic beat them works there is no more grace otherwise work is no more if I understand that works is what I told you ten commandments on your refrigerator every day you know I don't do this I don't mean this don't remember that's what to reach on loser did when he come to Jesus Jesus said if you kept the commandments he said from my youth as a child I've not broken any of them Ten Commandments right do you said well can you sell all you goods and that's what got because he put it all on work yes there wasn't enough grace in that rich young ruler to believe what Jesus told him if you'll sell everything you've got you know what Jesus was telling you really he was not saying something he got to be a poor man he said if you'll sell everything you got walk with me I'll give you eternal life and I'll do like I did go I'll multiply everything you got that was the party didn't get the retail ruler didn't get that part well how come you couldn't step up cause I was telling you that it is by grace and not worked because this is the big it's not in a message so much but out there the number links in the world ball says always cast by grace and not by works then you go over reboot James James said by work so and then so brother Brown comes up and preaches what works his faith expressed pleased to sermon works this faith and it explains every bit of it that it's not about works that you're saying but because you're saying you don't work our problem is the pentecostal said okay you do the works and look at the gray no gives a grace and then do the work okay that's to me that's pretty simple yeah if you just go about work so there's no grapes because if you go about works then you take brother Ramsay and you put him in hell yeah right that brother Ram John was telling you about if we look at it said okay don't go don't drink don't smoke dope cuz but run around you know we got a list I'm gonna for frigerator and they see by the remedy out drinking a cold beer they did got girl we see that we go through XM off because of his works we didn't see the Grayson then though the grace of God is going to cook him home okay keeping right okay done all right until that's the same way with you and I works is faith expressed exactly what then I have to go up with mother and infant a minute what there is will have not obtained that which he seeketh for you got that Israel have known obtained Israel is still 10 commandments works Moses Torah right and they seek for it what and they've obtained nothing it's got on nowhere but the election hath obtained it and the rest were blinded what the elect let's see what that signal it says the elect has obtained it and the rest were blinded now he's interpolating see it doesn't cook I mean no hey Porter them things best days thinking according to this written God have given them the spirit of slumber eyes that they see not and ears that they should not hear unto this day Israel and to this day are still blinded by God that's why God give them when we get in the fifth deal that's why God give them eternal life it's because he literally blinded them put his hand over their eyes and says you can't see me right now cuz I got a kid table right I gotta get out and David said let their table be made a snare and a trap and a stumbling block and a recompense them to them let your eyes be darkened on that Israeli that they may not see and bow down their back hallway I say then have they stumbled that they should fall god forbid but rather through their fall salvation has come to the Gentile I just said them rather through their fall salvation has come to the Gentiles for to provoke them to jealousy all right now so they didn't stumble no other day in Istanbul so that like I said this is wasted thing they've not stumbled and guys just kicked them out throw them in the shredder and put them in the trash and they're done with no for a time he's blinded their eyes so that we could come in just having two weeks a day oh you can see that little gap in between all of it anyway so remember Christ came to the Jew or the Oracles of God came to the Jews right so the Oracles of God came to the Jews will they come here to this place and this is the cross now they would accept it Christ all you would have seen was is one more week that would've been your 17 weeks of damage of 69 and 1 but because of me and you blindness in part has come to Israel let his blood be on us and our children God blinded their eyes so that 7 Church ages are a Gentile bride could work their way and when I was he gonna do he's gonna come right back with to witness for one more week to finish the 70 Lisa thing by two prophets cut off in the midst of the week then you know valve Armageddon gonna put us we're gonna come back over here this is what we're coming back but blindness in part is come to Israel or rather through their fall salvation is tongue to the Gentile if I understand that that's the part I like Colette's meet you that's a Gentile Church and that is our box right our inheritance is right thing we don't get this in there yes Israel gets this in there that's right they're having inheritance here two prophets you're going to come save 144,000 guys gonna come down and fight for them Mike will come down and fight if you buy the worm again all this is wiped off and guess what we're all comes back into the Moline okay not some promise so they get a promise they get 70 weeks every Lisa Daniel is a promise to the Gipp to the Jew and all right yesterday I've always said Daniel is the Book of Revelations to the Jews just like our Book of Revelations is to the Gentiles okay and it's intertwined it's intertwined in Revelation but now you look at Daniel that was that was what 70 weeks are determined to save it well he's determined you hear that I'm determined to save Israel because right now they don't want it that's still got the end come yet then the boy when he does three and a half years it took us 2,000 years to understand Christ it's only gonna take them three and a half years to understand that they missed it but you know why it's going to be two prophets just like what they need they need two prophets Moses Elijah - because I don't listen I don't know if live you look around when I preached it but on the five comings of logic the Jews are looking for Elijah has to show up before Christ comes well it is it's number five they just miss number four coming to the Gentile pages coming to us right right but they are looking as soon as Elijah hits the stage over there in Israel they gonna flop to it now there will be some fall away but they're gonna flop right to me and here comes another the spirit of Moses showing the great signs of shutting the heavens up and do it all these things and buddy they're going to preach a powerful sixth seal message it's going to take them out of here and we're gonna have the same thing go six seal finishes prediction we'll get into that later in the sixth seal through their fall salvation has come to the Gentiles / to provoke them to jealousy they have to follow them be the riches of the world and the diminishing of them the riches of the end house how much more than fullness the Jews are like we're rich the Jews are still rich there are filthy rich ok but they don't have the riches of the Gentiles my riches or not the external diamonds and rubies and doing all that knowledge the baptism of the Holy Ghost how much more their phones for I speak to you Gentiles in as much as I am the apostle of the Gentiles I magnify on that office now you'd make 5 selfie magnifiers off if by any means I may provoke to emulation if I know what that word is we're gonna find out what it is right here because it's jealousy for if anybody means I may provoke to jealousy then which are my flesh and might save some of them he's rebuking him it's telling them that Christ has come to the Gentiles my people for if the casting away of them be the reconciling of the world what shall the receiving of them the little life from death he's asking question look for him the first-fruit be holy the lump is also lonely into Ruth be holy so are the branches now watch remember you never grasped it in okay in grafting of the Gentiles way we weren't the truth tree Ezra was the truth tree but Val gentle being a wild olive tree we were Wow oh we're grafted in among them and with them for takis of the root and fatness of the olive tree we get to bless into Israel we now have the blessing to visualize Abraham Isaac Jacob don't all those people we understand that alright I'll have enough to finish this we're gonna go right here and if some of the branches be broken off and thou being a wild olive tree were grafted in among them right here here's a tree here's the tree here's the engrafting this wild olive tree branch was grafted in and it grew and then it's going to be cut because when it's being cut we're going up amen that branch is gonna take rafter but the tree is still going to be growing most not amongst both not amongst the branches but if thou boast thou bear'st not the fruit but the root bears thing that I will say then the branches were broken off that I might be grafted in will work we'll get to verse 20 next week a little mark there right there let's go stick [Music]
