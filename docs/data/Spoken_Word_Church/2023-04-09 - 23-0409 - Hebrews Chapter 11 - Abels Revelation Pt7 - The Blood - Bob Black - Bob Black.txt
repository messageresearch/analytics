========================================

foreign on this Resurrection morning let me just get these little slides going here I mean I just want to read this question he was coming over this morning we were uh we just looked over to the side you start thinking about things it's Christ rising from the grave on this day and everything and and uh Monica looked out the window and there's a little white dove if you know anything about doves seeing a white dove is really rare the last time we saw a white dove was when we were moving into the house where we are right now and uh so it's just you know sometimes just God does something a little special for you an Ephesian Church age brother Brown said uh because we've been we've been kind of meditating on uh Hebrews chapter 11 and we're at the at the spot in that in that scripture in that chapter where it's talking about eight the difference between Abel and Cain's sacrifices and brother Brown said in the Ephesian Church age he said Adam took her back speaking of Eve he knew exactly what he was doing but he did it anyway she was a part of him and he was willing to take her responsibility upon himself he would not let her go so Eve conceived by him he knew she would he knew exactly what would happen to the human race and he sold the human race into sin that he might have sinned that he might have Eve for he loved her and so those two sons were born sons that would be the fathers of the human race that was even now polluted I doesn't have something to say he's to the last time we were talking about how how polluted things got since what happened in the Garden of Eden we know that you know the real story that it wasn't the the reason why things are in the situation they're today they are in today is not just because somebody ate some kind of a fruit like a like an apple or a pomegranate but because these things in the Bible that we read about are symbols the whole the whole book of the Bible throughout is the book of symbols The Book of Revelation as the book of symbols when you read it and you look at the four creatures and the seven churches and all these things they're symbols they're symbols of things that really happen and we know that eating that eating that fruit is a symbol of something that happened and so Abel uh as we get to verse four Abel Abel had a revelation of what happened and Cain had an intellectual understanding that's why they came with different sacrifices let's just pray before we get into our study well God we're so grateful to be able to gather around your word and study these things out this morning and and and look into your scriptures Lord and Lord we just come this morning Lord to be helped Lord God and I pray Lord just bless us Lord as we prepare our hearts for the for the main event as brother Chris long is preparing Lord Jesus to bring us the word we've come with hungry hearts Lord Jesus and we're expecting Lord to be fed we're expecting you to give us what we have need of this morning and I pray God as you'll just be with us today we ask your blessing Lord and your name so verse 4 says and by faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain let's see y'all excuse me by which he obtained a witness that he was righteous God testifying of his gifts and by he being dead yes speaketh now you you we we've kind of been dwelling a lot on the difference was Faith are you thinking about faith faith is a revelation and faith is how you know which way to go uh you you know what you think about any many of you in here might be making decisions and things in life Faith everything's got to be based on a revelation of what what you need to do that's why Abel brought a sacrifice a lamb as a sacrifice because God revealed him what he needed to do that's why Noah built a boat because God revealed what he needed to do that's why Abraham turned around and started going a different direction in his life because God revealed what he needed to do that's why you go to a certain church or pick a different job or pick a wife or a husband is because if God not just oh if we could if we could base our life not just some something we think is a good idea or something that we you know looking for little likes and things and looking for something but if we can base our whole life and every decision that we make every when we come to a Crossroads in life to wait for God to reveal it to us and that's how Abel knew how to bring the right kind of sacrifice because he waited on God to reveal it to him you know we will think sometimes that you know that that uh you one of the things ireneous and the early church fault against was that Gnostic idea that Revelation comes from something outside of the word that you can just go sit up under a tree and and not never read your Bible to go to church but just something will just pop into your head but that's not how it works the reason Abel had a revelation because he had heard he had heard the story of how they came out of the of Eden and how that God had killed a lamb and and and covered them with the blood and you know all these things got to turn and he began to wonder God surely you got to show me the way back everything that's the same way it happens today the reason when you get a revelation it's not just something something ethereal popping into your head that's based on you know a cartoon you watched or something but a revelation is based upon the word of God and you see I just want to bring it down to where we think is is so far out of our reach sometimes like like to maybe think to to dramatize it to the point where you think that that Abel you know didn't didn't hear got got some kind of special special instruction that came didn't or something you see right here sitting in this in this congregation this morning everybody's hearing the same hearing the same word preached everybody's got the same opportunity just like Cain and Abel back then you hear the same word priests the same lessons taught the sitting under the same tutelage and all those things but it depends on whether we're willing to wait on God for a revelation whether we're willing to open up our heart to receive from him and you see you read through this whole story even came when Abel had a talk with him Cain was not willing to just just humble himself and just do it's it's so simple almost like almost like that train sitting out on the train tracks if you just just do what God Said but Cain was not even willing to to do what obviously God had Vindicated when God came down and Vindicated what people that that Abel's sacrifice was correct but what Adam and Eve had done in the garden had set set the course for everything that we see and uh all the horrors of life and great going to the graveyard and because God had promised he said of that of the tree of the knowledge of Good and Evil Thou shalt not eat of it but in the day that thou edest thereof Thou shalt surely die and brother Brown said in Oneness he said his kingdom can promise nothing but death Satan's kingdom that's all he has he's the author of death he can promise lies because he's the father of Lies he can't give you life he can't give you Heaven he has no heaven to give you think of it one word to disbelieve God through a promise of the devil or his Machinery one word sends you into torment I think that should give us Comfort though this morning that if we got the true word if the word's been restored then we got to get way back if if one word off sent them and send the whole world into torment then uh thank God that God sent us a prophet in this day to restore everything back so that we could come back and and the Oneness into fellowship with God the way we've got an understanding of the way back just like Abel had an understanding of the way back he needed a sacrifice and God gave us the sacrifice he gave us his word he gave us his blood he gave us his life one word off will bring death and that's why I've got a I've got a picture at you anybody know what these are I want to just maybe raise your hand this is these are the gravestones of Martin Luther and John Wesley because brother Brandon said in wisdom versus Faith he said that's where she started sinking right there that's where the whole human race went right down to the Grave from right there because she doubted one word one word off will take you to the Grave one word off but God has been restoring it he promised in Joel I will restore and one with the if one word off will take you to the Grave one more all the word restored will bring us out of it in Psalm chapter 51 he said behold I was shaping in iniquity and in sinned and my mother can see me in Ephesians 2 3 among whom also we all had our conversation in time past and the lust of our flesh fulfilling the desires of the Flesh and of the mind and we're by Nature the children of Wrath even as others what we'll see oh if we just meditate on these things that we're not we're we're not messed up because of just somebody taking a bite off of an apple we're messed up because of this of what happened uh underneath that symbol in the Garden of Eden that that uh Eve Eve polluted the whole Human Race by by believing one word off she she was unable to uh fulfill God's word in her womb because her womb was polluted her mind and her womb was polluted and then the whole human race got polluted because he said the serpent seed was the degradation of humanity by anger mingling the sea so oh you put a picture in your mind of how everything just got so polluted that our minds are polluted and our and our hearts are polluted our hearts uh where we we were born in carnality we were shaping in carnality shaping apart from we weren't brought into existence by by a revelation upon God's word but by carnal desire and but God has given us his word and made a sacrifice and made a way for us to go back to Deliver us from our our carnality to Deliver Us from all these things that Paul's talking about in the lust in Ephesians Institute the lust of the Flesh and the desires of the Flesh of the mind and and we were by Nature the children of Wrath even as others and job he said in Job chapter 15 what is man that he should be cleaned and he which is born of a woman that he should be righteous behold he put all this job talking it sounds a little bit depressing to read how he was in that state what how should how should I be made clean behold he puteth no trust in his Saints yea the heavens are not cleaning his sight he's talking about God God he's not putting his trust in any man he's not putting it even even some job's painting a picture so much that that even God looking at the heavens are not not clean in his sight how how are we going to stand in in a a a God that wants so much Purity how could how can us in our filthiness he said how much more abominable and filthy as man which drinketh iniquity like water laughs and Adam come out and he the Bible says in Genesis chapter 3 verse 7 and The Eyes of them both were opened and they knew that they were naked and they sewed fig leaves together and made themselves apron think about that's how sometimes we do we try to we try to patch things up as filthy as we are in the depravity of our mind and our carnality we try to be holy through our own works and our own actions and he covered himself over with fig leaves with his own works and with his own a man-made religion saying well I'm I'm gonna I'm gonna try to make it work myself you see that that that'll never work the eyes of them both were open and they knew that they were naked and they sewed fig leaves together and made themselves aprons brother Brown said now notice then when Adam his fig leaves were all right as long as he didn't have to face God you think about that your man your man-made works all right as long as you don't have to face God but when he had to face God he realized his fig leaves was no good amen oh you see you Paul talked about that we we gotta we got to be resurrected from our dead Works uh The Works of it that we try to we try to just manufacture something that's not sufficient it'll never be sufficient where you you come to church and you pay your tithes and you do good things and you show up and you warm the Pew and you sing her some songs and even get in the spirit sometimes but God wants somebody that'll serve him in spirit and Truth to know what he's worshiping about that can that can they can get under that shed blood and he said and now friend you might think you're a pretty good person and you might be that's right but when you come to face God you're if you haven't accepted God's provided sacrifice for you you're lost and you'll know it now that's that goes back to the difference between Cain and Abel's sacrifice the difference between Abel sacrifice Abel knew he needed some blood he needed a sacrifice he needed the way back was through a life that life had to be shared and and and Cain uh Kane just came with trying to trying to manufacture something pulling some some nice looking plants out of the field and and bringing them to offer before God and God never offered that in Genesis chapter 3 verse 21 it says uh unto Adam also to his wife did the Lord God make coats of skins and clothe him and brother said in law or Grace see what kind of a blood was that bled animals blood animal life for a human life it just can't take away sin camp now when Jesus come it wasn't only human's life but it was God's own life himself that's what was in his blood and I was sitting here this morning thinking about the resurrection and why Jesus had to die that's why he had to die to pay for our to pay for our impurity for our degradation our our carnality the mess that we had got in to bring us back into fellowship with him that's that's what Easter Sunday is about brother Ram said in the law having a shout out now when as I read this quote this is where brother Brandman I think in the next sermon he looked back and he said as he was preaching this he was actually seeing a vision of it unfold and he said he said there when Adam sinned the most horrible thing I can see is that day when them children sinned and God called them out behind the bushes and throw them in Old bloody aprons in there there stood his Heritage his own children standing there look at Eve around that beautiful body of hers is wrapped in Old bloody sheepskin the blood running down off her like that and dripping down her perfect shaped body there's Adam standing there not a brute a perfect made man his muscles and his arms the muscles and his big legs his shaggy hair around his shoulders his dark beard hanging a perfect man look at that now he's saying look at that now because he's seeing it look at that now I see his shoulder stooping around his big body Here Comes an old bloody sheepskin running down those big manly legs comes blood tears is dripping off his big cheeks patent on the top of Eve's head as she leans over on his bosom and little Eve crying the tears patting down as it mixes with blood running down her bosom what's the matter Something's Happened they can cry now they're mortal now they're dying now there you are now doesn't that paint a picture that that we all need a savior we all need somebody that's because we can't have any confidence in your flesh of where you came from in your natural genealogy but what we can have confidence in and what is what Christ did for us that his life was shed so that same life could come back and live in Youth and Tabernacle himself in you in Romans chapter 3 it says what then are we better than they no and no wise for we have proof both Jews and Gentiles everybody everybody's all under sin as it is written there's none righteous no not wonders nobody can boast to where you come from or or your heritage or anything like you we're all we're all guilty there's none that understand this there's none that seeketh after God they are all gone out of the way they are together become unprofitable there is none that doeth good no not one in Romans verse chapter 3 verse 23 he said all have sinned and come short of the glory of God and in chapter 5 verse 8 he said but God commendeth his love toward us and that while we were yet sinners Christ died for us it seems like sometimes we just hammer on those things that we all need a a savior but because it you know even in the day that when Noah priest before as he was building that Ark it seemed I'm sure he wondered why people didn't run to the ark it's so difficult sometimes to convince people that they need a savior that they're not where they need to be and see that's the difference between Abel and Cain and Cain came with his with his his it looked like a good a good religious experience Balaam came with the same altars and all the all the things you could compare with the way that Israel worshiped but yet there was something lacking Abel came with a revelation a revelation and if we can come if oh if God can touch our hearts with a real revelation of who he is and and and draw us if you can begin to realize this morning that God is speaking to you that God wants to save you and God wants to change you then something began to take take place Jesus made God made that promise in Genesis chapter 3 I will put enmity between thee and the woman and between thy seed and her seed they shall bruise thy head and thou shalt bruise his heel you think what a comfort that should be to this this morning thinking here on Easter Sunday that God made that promise thousands of years ago that he's going to do something as they were going out of the out of the Garden of Eden covered in covered in lambskins he made a promise I'm going to put enmity I'm going to there's going to be a battle wage between the good and the and the wrong between the right and the wrong I'm a enmity between thee and the woman and between thy seed and her seat and and there's the main the main point that we're talking about this morning that the serpent had a seed and the woman had a seed that God gave her a seed and he said it that woman's seed shall bruise thy head and thou shalt bruise his heal the serpent seat will Brew the Christ on the cross as he died and he made that promise that he's going to do something about it about that situation and then the message expectation he said tonight with our Throne blessings in our heart by his grace to know that we were Sinners and he came and took our place and died as a sinner died in my place he died my death at Calvary he died all of our deaths at Calvary and the sin my me as a sinner he represented me in his death at Calvary he represented every believer tonight in his death at Calvary and God reconciling us and his love to us raised him up again for our justification if we have confidence in what he did I want to just kind of take a little deviation you see we it says that the woman's it talks about the woman's seed and and the serpency there but what about Adam see do you see you can't have confidence we're not basing our confidence on where our flesh came from this morning but we're covering our confidence is based on what Christ did for us because in First Corinthians it says for as an Adam all die Adam Adam stepped out knowing where the the human race and everything what would happen and he he understood that his action would put everybody into a bind so when Adam all die even so in Christ in Christ shall all be made alive and in Galatians chapter 3 it says now to Abraham and his Seed where the promises made he saith not in the seasons of many but as of one and to thy seed which is Christ that seed is the one I want to be part of Romans 8 29 says for whom he did for no he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn the firstborn among many brothers now you say well I'm born of Adam I'm born of this one or whatever I can trace my lenians this way or that way I can trace my linear as my spiritual lineage back to Jesus Christ because he was the firstborn among many brethren and Titus says avoid foolish questions in genealogies and contentions and striving is about the law for they are unprofitable in vain it's unprofitable to talk about genealogies and those sorts of arguments and contentions but what's profitable is to know that you've been born again that his life has been has been tabernacled in you and it's starting to change you from the inside out like brother Chris was preaching yesterday that God's Building the body as you as you hear the word something's happening on the inside of you God has taken you over and changing you so what about Adam's seed if brother said in the Ephesian church if you said if the seed of the woman was a man-child apart from the man in other words Adam didn't have nothing to do with that man that was born Cain then the seed of the serpent will have to be in the same pattern sorry I got that backwards the seat of the woman is Christ was a man child apartment a man in the seated serpent will have to be in the same pattern and that is another man another male must be born apart from human male instrumentality in other words Cain didn't have nothing to do with Adam and and there wasn't a man that had anything to do with Christ being born he was born completely apart of Joseph had nothing to do with it he his birth had nothing to do with with any any male any man touching the situation that's where our confidence is this morning in Philippians chapter 3 he said for we are the circumcision Paul's speaking again which worshiped God in the spirit not in the flesh and rejoice in Christ Jesus and have no confidence in the flesh and I got a little picture of on the left of that kind of illustrate the difference between your carnality and something on the inside that's taking place as you hear the word though I might also have confidence in the flesh Paul's speaking now if any other man thinketh that he hath aware of he might Trust In the Flesh I'm more Paul's laying out a situation he said I got a lot of stuff I can trust in as far as my genealogy and how I'm keeping the law and all that stuff just in my flesh I was circumcised The Eighth Day of the stock of Israel of The Tribe of Benjamin and Hebrew of the Hebrews as touching the law of Pharisee boy that's a lot of bullets that you could tick off that you could have a lot of confidence in your flesh of how you were born and the tribe you were part of and when you were born and all those kind of things he said concerning Zeal persecuting the church touching the righteousness which is in the law blameless but what things were gained to me those I counted loss for Christ is the thing we should be after Christ is the main thing I have no I think we could all say this morning I have no confidence in the flesh I have no confidence in my own abilities and my own Works in any kind of fig tree I can hide myself behind fig leaves that I can cover myself with I have no confidence in the actions that I do to try to be a good person because it's not being about a good person I want to be a Christian the only way to be a Christian is to accept what Jesus did on this day two thousand years ago that he died for you so that he could come and live in you [Applause] you see what he did fulfilled what types and what Moses types thousands of years ago in the wilderness says he said let's let's make a serpent and a bronze serpent that's lifted up as John in John chapter 3 you said as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness even so must the son of man be lifted up that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have have eternal life and then that famous scripture for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life what was Jesus doing when he was lifted up on that cross he was fulfilling that type in the Old Testament taking everything that the serpent had done had taken all of your guilt and all of your shame and all of your degradation and all of your all of your iniquity on himself and being he was lifted up on that cross to die for you so that you wouldn't have to die and in the Old Testament as as the type you're looking at the type all they had to do to be saved would just look at that bronze serpent I hope you see so many today just won't just won't look just won't look at what Christ did for us the greatest evidence of love that could ever be displayed was when Christ lifted up and was lifted up on that cross to die for everything you've done everything you didn't do everything everything that you just you just inherited as part of that sin curse that came down from the Garden of Eden just just because you're in this messed up human condition that he died he died for you and if you can be that you can be delivered from that if you'll just look to him look to him and believe and accept what Christ did for you this morning amen we'll just end on that as I pray that our hearts are prepared for the for the message this morning God bless you and think upon this Resurrection morning what Christ did for us today thank you
