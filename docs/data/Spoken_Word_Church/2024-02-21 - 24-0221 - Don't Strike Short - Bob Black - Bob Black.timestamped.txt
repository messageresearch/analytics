[17:19] short Lord Jesus we're so grateful Lord
[17:22] for your word that you've given us in
[17:23] this hour Lord God when it seems like
[17:26] just the devil's everywhere all around
[17:28] us Lord of just bombarding us with with
[17:30] hurdles and trials and things Lord Jesus
[17:33] but you give us your word Lord to
[17:35] encourage us and to equip us Lord
[17:37] against the enemy against all the fiery
[17:39] darts of the wicked one I pray Lord
[17:42] tonight that these words Lord will just
[17:43] hit home exactly where they need to
[17:45] strike Lord Jesus give us encouragement
[17:47] Lord right here in the middle of the
[17:49] week Lord that you'll just be with us
[17:51] tonight in this little service Grant it
[17:53] now Lord in your name
[17:57] amen so if we'll read from verse 14 it
[18:00] says now
[18:02] Elisha was Fallen sick of his sickness
[18:05] whereof he
[18:06] died and joash the king of Israel came
[18:10] down unto him and wept over his face and
[18:13] said oh my father my father The Chariot
[18:15] of Israel and the horsemen
[18:17] thereof in other words he's telling them
[18:20] you are the very strength of Israel he's
[18:24] telling them you're the one that's
[18:25] keeping everything together your
[18:27] ministry and so forth
[18:29] and he said Elisha Elisha said unto him
[18:32] take bow and arrows and he took unto him
[18:35] bow and arrows and he said to the king
[18:38] of Israel put thine hand upon the bow
[18:42] and he put his hand upon it and Elisha
[18:44] put his hands upon the king's hands and
[18:46] he said open the window Eastward and he
[18:49] opened it then Elisha said shoot and he
[18:53] shot and he said the arrow of the Lord's
[18:55] deliverance and the arrow of deliverance
[18:58] from Syria
[18:59] for Thou shalt Smite the syrians in Apec
[19:02] till thou H have consumed them the Lord
[19:04] at his Blessing to the reading of the
[19:06] word you may be
[19:12] seated isn't that ain't that interesting
[19:14] how sometimes the Lord will give us give
[19:16] us these these wonderful little stories
[19:18] in the Old Testament they seem like they
[19:20] what what does this mean and there's a
[19:22] meaning to everything there's something
[19:23] behind each of these things open up the
[19:25] window and shoot an arrow out of it and
[19:29] then go find that era go run around in
[19:32] the weeds and find that era and if
[19:34] you've ever shot an air into the weeds
[19:36] it it's it's quite difficult to find I I
[19:39] mean we've just kind of been playing
[19:41] around in the backyard with Zach's
[19:43] little toy erors before and shot it like
[19:46] 10t away and how you go it's like you
[19:49] just can't find it but that's what the
[19:52] prophet told him go find that air go
[19:55] hunt it out and then bring it back
[19:57] strike it on the ground
[19:59] and and i' I've got a prophecy for you
[20:02] that you're going to Smite the syrians
[20:04] and you're going to always think about
[20:06] that when a prophet tells you something
[20:08] what encouragement that can be and all
[20:12] all these words that we're reading
[20:13] laying here in the Bible from Genesis to
[20:16] Revelation are given to us straight from
[20:19] God to encourage us and When God Says
[20:21] something you can just Bank everything
[20:24] on
[20:24] it think now no matter how mysterious it
[20:28] seems
[20:29] go shoot an error go find it bring it
[20:31] back grab it bang on the ground three
[20:34] times no matter how mysterious it seems
[20:37] God always keeps his word no matter how
[20:41] mysterious it seems God always keeps his
[20:43] word no matter how unreasonable it may
[20:45] seem to people God keeps his word if God
[20:49] makes a promise of anything God will
[20:52] keep that promise he's just looking for
[20:54] somebody tonight to believe him now I I
[20:57] believe in this present day what we're
[20:59] living in that God still keeps his
[21:01] promises there might be things in the
[21:03] Bible that seem perplexing that we don't
[21:05] understand but yet God is there to back
[21:07] it up if we'll just believe it if we'll
[21:09] just yield ourselves to him think about
[21:12] God being infinite then he knows all the
[21:14] future from the beginning and he don't
[21:16] make a promise L he knows what's going
[21:20] to
[21:21] happen oh you think about that that God
[21:24] made a promise through Elisha here that
[21:27] the syrians are going to be are are
[21:29] going to be consumed and that God was
[21:31] going to do it he was going to fight
[21:32] their battles and think of all the
[21:33] stories and all the things that we've
[21:35] heard even in this Modern Age think
[21:37] about Congressman Upshaw when he was he
[21:40] was standing there in one of the
[21:41] meetings and and and and and brother
[21:43] Brandman had the vision of him and he
[21:44] Congressman Upshaw was sitting there
[21:47] listening to the to the message and all
[21:48] of a sudden he realized that he was
[21:50] actually in a vision that he was
[21:52] actually and and brother brandham called
[21:54] him out is that how it is sometimes when
[21:56] you're listening to the word and you
[21:58] realize you recognize that you're part
[22:00] of the story that you're part of the
[22:03] story that's being laid out here that
[22:05] you're part of it and he he began to
[22:07] realize that he's part of that vision
[22:09] and he just stepped right into it and
[22:11] that's how when we hear the word we just
[22:13] we're just you get caught up in that
[22:15] stream and you just kind of get moved
[22:18] along with it if you can get caught up
[22:19] in the rhythm of the word you begin to
[22:21] move along with it and you become part
[22:23] of it that makes you part of the Bible
[22:26] part of the word a continuation of the
[22:29] book of Acts that God is still doing
[22:32] something today in this very hour just
[22:34] like he did all down through history
[22:37] that that isn't that amazing that that
[22:40] the same that the Christian Life can be
[22:42] the same today that it was in the life
[22:44] of Paul that it was in the life of the
[22:46] early church that God is still living
[22:49] and still working today just like it was
[22:52] then and faith faith will make all these
[22:56] promises a reality you think about how
[22:59] when when God made a promise to Noah
[23:02] that that no water in the sky it looked
[23:06] like no water anywhere and he made a
[23:08] promise and and Noah just believed him
[23:11] and he got to work he didn't just sit
[23:12] there but he got to work and he started
[23:14] hammer and building on that Ark and it
[23:16] rained just the same and Moses Moses
[23:19] down there for 40 years in the
[23:21] wilderness and got all uh maybe
[23:24] downtrodden downhearted lost all hopes
[23:27] of freedom but yet in the light of God
[23:30] when he got in front of that burning
[23:31] bush it made all the promises of God
[23:34] just bring to life and he a was able to
[23:36] step forth from that burning bush and go
[23:38] down to Egypt knowing that God was with
[23:41] him knowing that God is a present tense
[23:44] God a present tense living reality all
[23:47] the stories that Moses had heard his
[23:49] mama tell him about when he sat sat at
[23:51] her feet and to all the little bible
[23:53] stories and things about how they they
[23:56] had prayed for a deliverer and all those
[23:57] things where most mes couldn't fulfill
[23:59] it on his own but when he got in front
[24:01] of that burning bush and he heard from
[24:03] God himself that it made it changed
[24:06] everything in the light of God standing
[24:09] by by that burning bush everything in
[24:12] him
[24:13] changed now our prophet in this day
[24:16] would say why brother if we' ever come
[24:17] in the presence of God like Moses did
[24:19] why it was revolutionary to him and the
[24:22] light of that angel of God standing
[24:24] there on that mountain that day
[24:26] everything that he once had or thought
[24:29] never would happen come to be a reality
[24:33] and I think if men and women today would
[24:35] ever step into the light of the Holy
[24:37] Spirit under the unction of God's spirit
[24:40] and the light of God's word everything
[24:42] that God has promised will illuminate to
[24:45] you and be real again oh that's what we
[24:48] need brothers and sisters as a real
[24:49] experience with god well that makes us
[24:52] makes our heart change that makes us
[24:54] love to be in church that makes us love
[24:56] God and love one another and live this
[24:58] real Christian Life in a way that's not
[25:01] fake it it will illuminate the word to
[25:03] you and make it real again it will make
[25:06] it real just like it did for Moses when
[25:08] he stood there in that burning bush and
[25:10] he realized that God was God oh you see
[25:13] that's what the new birth does that new
[25:14] birth gives you brother Brandon would
[25:16] say that it takes your mental faith that
[25:18] you come to church with and maybe try to
[25:20] work things out on your own and have an
[25:22] intellectual Faith but the new birth
[25:24] will take your mental faith and elevate
[25:25] it to a supernatural faith I'm talking
[25:28] about a supernatural God living in a
[25:30] people that are just maybe carnal but
[25:32] he'll change them change them to to
[25:35] match the super a supernat a
[25:37] supernatural experience where you can
[25:39] believe God's word when it seems past
[25:42] understanding that Noah could that rain
[25:44] would fall and carry that Ark away that
[25:46] that one man and his little family could
[25:49] go down and deliver Israel out of the
[25:51] hand of the Egyptians we're believing in
[25:53] a supernatural God the reason Moses
[25:57] failed in the first place was the lack
[25:58] of having what that burning bush had you
[26:00] think Moses standing there looking at
[26:02] that bush burning and there was
[26:03] something Supernatural that was making
[26:05] that bush burn without it burning away
[26:08] something Supernatural there and Moses
[26:11] recognized I I need that oh well when we
[26:14] come to church and we get around other
[26:16] believers if we could just recognize if
[26:18] there's something lacking in our life
[26:20] that that's what we need to make us to
[26:22] make us live a real Christian Life and
[26:24] and and do the things that the Bible
[26:26] said a real Christian is going to be
[26:28] able I do what our failure today is lack
[26:31] having what the Holy Spirit has and the
[26:33] Holy Spirit has all good things for us
[26:35] and if we receive the Holy Spirit then
[26:37] all things are possible and not only
[26:40] possible but promised to us you ought to
[26:43] think about that to think about that
[26:45] that all these things written of here in
[26:47] the Bible that that that you can be
[26:49] delivered of those complexes you can be
[26:51] delivered of those depressive thoughts
[26:53] you can be delivered of things that
[26:54] plague you when the Devil comes and
[26:56] barrages you with all kind of thoughts
[26:58] in the night time that you can be
[26:59] delivered and you don't have to deal you
[27:00] don't have to deal with that you can
[27:03] give it back to the devil and all God
[27:05] requires of us is just to believe his
[27:07] word all God requires of you is just to
[27:10] open up your heart and let the word sink
[27:12] down into the good ground of your heart
[27:13] and hang on to it and you watch and it
[27:15] will produce it's going to produce
[27:17] something he sends the Holy Spirit to
[27:20] energize that word when he falls into it
[27:22] I think think to tonight that that's
[27:24] what the Holy Spirit does the Holy Ghost
[27:26] takes the word that's laying there on
[27:28] the page and energizes it to make it
[27:31] come to life just like just like the
[27:34] spirit of any speaker will take the
[27:37] words and give meaning to them we'll
[27:39] take the words and give a life to it
[27:41] it's the spirit that gives life it's the
[27:44] spirit that makes it live and takes this
[27:46] this dead letter laying here on the page
[27:48] that maybe can be questioned about and
[27:50] maybe can be probed at and say well I
[27:52] don't know if that's true or not but
[27:54] when the Holy Spirit comes it takes all
[27:56] the doubt away it takes all the reason
[27:59] away because God is on the scene the
[28:02] holy spirit is what gives meaning to the
[28:04] words that we're reading
[28:05] here when the word's being preached and
[28:08] the Holy Spirit brings the word he
[28:10] energizes that and flashes the same
[28:13] light of God's blessed promise and we
[28:15] know of course that God always keeps his
[28:18] promise God always keeps his promise if
[28:20] he can just find somebody to believe it
[28:23] that's the requirement he's looking for
[28:25] somebody that he can get a hold of some
[28:27] little boy Bo or girl or some man or
[28:29] woman that can it doesn't matter if
[28:31] nobody else believes it doesn't matter
[28:33] if the whole rest of the world believes
[28:34] all he needs is just one person to get a
[28:36] hold of and maybe sitting here tonight
[28:37] maybe you're that person maybe you're
[28:40] that person like like Jonah when when
[28:42] God was looking for somebody to go to
[28:44] Nineveh and preach and he looked and he
[28:46] searched all around and he found Jonah
[28:48] and he wanted Jonah to go to preach so
[28:50] bad that he followed him on that boat
[28:52] brother random would say that when Jonah
[28:54] was on that boat he everywhere he looked
[28:56] God was and he couldn't get away from it
[28:58] because God was after him and maybe
[29:01] tonight you're the one that God is after
[29:04] maybe you're the one that you're the
[29:05] only one that can do it you're the only
[29:07] one that tonight you're the one that God
[29:09] wants to get a hold of and and and he
[29:12] wants to see you respond to him to
[29:14] fulfill his promises in you to do
[29:17] something in you and to think about the
[29:18] promise the promise of the Holy Ghost to
[29:20] make somebody live for him and believe
[29:24] for him and believe his word and live a
[29:27] holy SE separated life now tonight
[29:29] aren't you so glad that you can be a
[29:31] real Christian and live a life that the
[29:33] world can't live many people would love
[29:36] to be able to live a really Holy Ghost
[29:38] filled life to be able to dress holy and
[29:41] walk holy and be kind to one another and
[29:44] speak good words speak kind words maybe
[29:47] when somebody pulls out in front of you
[29:49] or or or says something harsh in the in
[29:51] the line at the grocery store to always
[29:53] respond with love and kind and and and
[29:55] many people try to do it and they just
[29:57] fail because they they're lacking
[29:59] something like Moses realized he needed
[30:01] what was in that burning bush and you
[30:03] can't do it without the holy ghost in
[30:05] your life to make the word come up off
[30:07] the page and live and you you can't do
[30:09] it you got to have the Holy Ghost God
[30:13] always keeps his promise oh if tonight
[30:15] he's looking for somebody that he can
[30:17] fulfill his promise in somebody that he
[30:19] can get a hold of and maybe that's
[30:21] somebody as you now they had a great
[30:24] line of Kings in this story that we're
[30:26] reading of all the way back from from
[30:28] Ahab now you think about how Ahab lived
[30:30] such a horrible life he he he got yolked
[30:33] up with Jezebel who was was not you know
[30:37] not at all a holy person it was an
[30:39] unbeliever and halfway in halfway out
[30:42] and and Elijah had told Ahab how he was
[30:45] going to die that he'd go out in the
[30:46] battlefield and the arrow be shot up and
[30:48] it' just randomly fall in between his
[30:51] armor and he'd fall out on the
[30:52] battlefield think about that that God
[30:54] just got allowed that era to strike him
[30:57] right between the armor where where
[30:59] there was a little Gap and the AA struck
[31:01] him down in the middle of the
[31:02] battlefield and Elijah had prophesied
[31:05] that how Jezabel was going to be fed to
[31:07] the dogs because she did Evil all the
[31:09] evil that she had done and you think
[31:11] about in life how that how that things
[31:14] that you do there there are consequences
[31:16] to your actions just like there were
[31:18] consequences in ahab's life and
[31:20] consequences to the way that Jezebel
[31:22] lived the things that they did in life
[31:24] it just built up built up and built up
[31:27] until at the end Jezebel's life ended up
[31:29] where there wasn't nothing left but the
[31:30] palms of her feet and the her her Palms
[31:33] of her hands and her and her feet
[31:34] because that's all the dogs the dogs ate
[31:37] everything else all they left was a pool
[31:38] of blood and a little bit little tidbits
[31:40] left because all the evil in her life
[31:43] had just accumulated and accumulated
[31:46] until that's what happened and and you
[31:48] see the lesson to here that we can get
[31:49] is remember that you will reap what you
[31:52] sow you will reap what you sow and
[31:55] that's that's actually God's law that
[31:56] God's law is that That's the Law of
[31:58] nature that whatever sewn into the
[32:00] ground Spring's coming up and you go out
[32:02] into the field and you plant some corn
[32:04] in the ground and you wait long enough
[32:06] and Corn's going to come up but you PL
[32:09] plant a Brier and and before long a
[32:11] Brier's going to come up you plant some
[32:13] Poison Ivy and after a while poison ivy
[32:15] is going to come up and the same thing
[32:17] in your life if you sow hateful words to
[32:19] your children after a while your
[32:21] children are going to hate you and
[32:22] they're not going to want to be around
[32:23] you you s loving words to your wife and
[32:26] your family and you watch it will SE it
[32:28] you will reap peace why because you reap
[32:31] what you sow and what you say and what
[32:34] you do after a while it will accumulate
[32:36] accumulate until maybe at the end of
[32:38] your life your life will be crowned
[32:40] either with a crown of the devil it'll
[32:42] be crowned with a crown of life and your
[32:45] whole life you'll reap you'll reap the
[32:47] things that you sow through your life
[32:49] that's God's nature that's God's law
[32:52] that's that that law that you reap what
[32:54] you sow now even think about today
[32:57] tonight that that if you if if the word
[33:00] of God if the promise of God is sown in
[33:03] your heart then you will reap what is
[33:05] sown in your heart if sitting here
[33:07] tonight if you open up your heart to the
[33:09] word of God that's being preached and
[33:11] sown and you say you know what that
[33:14] that's the thing that I've been looking
[33:15] for my whole life I've been searching
[33:18] for truth I've been going maybe from
[33:20] denomination to denomination from Pillar
[33:22] To Post and I've been looking for
[33:24] something that's real and maybe tonight
[33:26] this is the first time when you really
[33:28] found something that even sounds
[33:30] remotely real but you hang on to that
[33:32] and let it be sewn down in your heart
[33:34] and you watch and see if it doesn't come
[33:36] up and produce because it's a law of
[33:38] nature it's got to produce because the
[33:41] law says that whatever is sown that is
[33:44] what will be reaped Galatians 6: 78
[33:48] sayso not be deceived God cannot be
[33:51] mocked a man reaps what he SWS who
[33:55] whosoever SWS to please their flesh from
[33:58] the flesh will reap destruction
[34:00] whosoever sows to please the spirit from
[34:03] the spirit will reap eternal life so
[34:06] tonight we're not sewing we're not
[34:09] trying to please the flesh are we are
[34:11] you sew to re the FL if you spend all of
[34:14] your time like I was saying earlier Doom
[34:16] scrolling on Facebook or trying to to
[34:18] see on the message threads on the
[34:21] internet what's the greatest movie
[34:23] that's been released and that's all your
[34:25] focus is the things that can satisfy the
[34:27] flesh and make you happy in your idle
[34:30] time oh that's what you'll reap you'll
[34:32] reap something that will help your flesh
[34:34] but I don't want something that'll help
[34:36] my flesh I I want to die to myself I
[34:38] want to die so that the spirit Within Me
[34:40] can be loosed and live I want to live to
[34:43] the spirit and that's what I want to
[34:44] show how how do you satisfy the spirit a
[34:47] real Born Again child of God the only
[34:50] way that they can be satisfied is by
[34:52] that thing that nourishes the spirit the
[34:55] word of God and that's why real Born
[34:58] Again child of God they can't wait to
[35:00] come to church they can't wait to open
[35:02] their Bible they can't wait to get down
[35:05] on their knees early in the morning time
[35:06] and spend some a long time with God
[35:08] because they want to feed the thing
[35:11] that's on the inside they want to feed
[35:13] their soul oh if we could just get rid
[35:15] of let let our will just die so we we're
[35:18] not so concerned with our flesh and with
[35:20] the things that make us happy in this
[35:22] life and the our own will and and all
[35:25] those things and just lay our lay that
[35:27] down on the altar of sacrifice so that
[35:30] God can do something with us your
[35:33] actions your actions have consequences
[35:35] so so good do good speak good oh that's
[35:40] what I want my life to be it's just a
[35:43] trail of good he's so he he said good
[35:46] things no matter if somebody hated him
[35:48] or whatever he said good things he did
[35:51] good things even if it was hard he did
[35:53] good
[35:54] things and how do we do good things
[35:58] brother Brandon would say the best thing
[36:00] for you to do is keep an oldfashioned
[36:03] prayer meeting going and keep the unity
[36:05] of the spirit keep looking up and
[36:07] watching for the coming of the Lord keep
[36:09] the oldfashioned Holy Spirit falling
[36:11] among you keep the world out seal Christ
[36:15] in and he would say you're letting down
[36:18] in prayer some way just remember as you
[36:21] seow you'll reap just remember that oh
[36:26] think about these things that maybe
[36:27] maybe we've begun to let slide these
[36:29] things that were so important to the
[36:31] early church those little old brush aror
[36:34] meetings where they'd pray all night and
[36:37] and you know you you just had such a
[36:38] burden on your heart to really get along
[36:40] with god oh it wasn't maybe a battle
[36:43] back in them days to stay away from the
[36:45] TV because there was something in their
[36:47] heart a stirring it was the Revival days
[36:50] back then now we know the Revival Days
[36:52] Are Over the Revival the general Revival
[36:56] is where it just seems like all around
[36:58] there's a Revival fire burning but now
[36:59] there's a bride Revival a personal
[37:02] Revival that you might not see in the
[37:04] person next to you or just generally all
[37:06] around everywhere you go but down in
[37:09] your heart there's something stirring as
[37:11] the word is received in you and it it
[37:13] something something's lit on fire with
[37:15] you a personal a personal individual
[37:18] Revival with you and don't let that
[37:21] Revival die you keep that oldfashioned
[37:24] prayer meeting going keep the unity of
[37:26] the Holy Spirit keep looking up and
[37:28] watching for the coming of the Lord keep
[37:30] the oldfashioned Holy Spirit falling
[37:32] among you I I like the oldfashioned Holy
[37:34] Spirit I like the same kind of Holy
[37:37] Spirit I that's what I'm looking for the
[37:39] same kind of holy spirit that manifested
[37:41] in the book of Acts when they when they
[37:43] just laid in the shadow of people that
[37:46] they had confidence in and they received
[37:48] their healing where they could
[37:51] take clothes from off of the body of
[37:53] Paul and they had such confidence that
[37:55] the Holy Spirit was working that they
[37:57] belied that God will move all because
[37:59] they took a cloth from the body of Paul
[38:03] and they grabbed it and believed it and
[38:04] wherever they went they people believed
[38:06] that believed the word that was being
[38:08] preached were there at the gate
[38:10] beautiful they they were walking by and
[38:13] and Peter and John just said look on us
[38:15] and believe and and you know they didn't
[38:17] have any popularity to bring they didn't
[38:19] have any kind of any kind of money or
[38:21] something to offer that man that lay
[38:23] there at the gate beautiful but they
[38:24] said look on us and such as we have we
[38:26] give unto you and what they had were the
[38:28] words of eternal life what they had was
[38:31] something real and something genuine to
[38:33] give him that caused them to have
[38:35] confidence in them and he he leaped up
[38:37] from the ground and began to walk
[38:38] because why because God is real and that
[38:41] same God that caused that man to walk
[38:43] there 2,000 years ago that same God is
[38:46] still on the S today if we can believe
[38:48] it because God keeps his promises he
[38:51] keeps his promises his promises are true
[38:55] Satan Satan has a lot of empty promises
[38:58] you know that's all all Satan has to
[39:00] offer he has nothing to offer but a
[39:02] bunch of empty promises he can't do
[39:05] nothing but take away and say it's not
[39:07] yours you can't have it and he all he'll
[39:10] give you is a bunch of complexes in your
[39:13] mind and horrible thoughts and things
[39:15] you're trying to get away of and
[39:17] nervousness and and and and just
[39:20] constantly looking behind your back and
[39:22] wondering if somebody's out to get you
[39:24] oh I I want to get away from all that
[39:26] and just have confidence that God is on
[39:28] the scene and God is still able to lead
[39:31] and guide and direct our paths it
[39:33] doesn't matter what all all the all the
[39:35] obstacles all around us but yet I know
[39:37] that God is still on the scene oh if we
[39:40] can just don't let the world reach into
[39:42] you John 14:30 said the prince of this
[39:45] world cometh and hath nothing in me and
[39:47] I don't want nothing I don't want
[39:48] nothing the devil has to has to offer I
[39:50] don't want nothing the devil has to give
[39:53] just don't let the world creep into you
[39:55] amen how do we get it out pray it out
[39:58] fasted out until God comes down and
[40:00] takes a hold that's right and what
[40:03] what's happening when you pray it's a
[40:05] sacrifice there in that Holy place in
[40:08] the outer Court inner Court holy of
[40:10] holies and the Old Testament Tabernacle
[40:11] in that Holy place was that little altar
[40:13] of incense and in the Book of Revelation
[40:16] it says that that altar the prayers of
[40:19] the Saints go up as incense like the
[40:21] incense that was offered on that altar
[40:23] your prayers are like a sacrifice that's
[40:26] made to God's and what are you doing
[40:28] you're sacrificing yourself you're
[40:30] saying God take away take away all my
[40:32] enmity with my brother God take away the
[40:35] way that I think and the way that I am
[40:37] and I'm offering it up to you and I want
[40:39] you to change me and speak back to me
[40:41] and reveal to me things that are come
[40:43] reveal to me what your word says and as
[40:45] I lay myself down on the altar of
[40:48] sacrifice oh brother R's saying pray it
[40:51] out fast it out what what are you doing
[40:53] getting rid of yourself pray it out fast
[40:56] it out until God comes down and takes a
[40:59] hold like when he was there praying with
[41:02] with uh sister Rosella that time that
[41:05] the the little he he could he said she
[41:06] was a prostitute somebody that lived in
[41:09] the world and and done so many things a
[41:11] you could unroll the LA list of the
[41:14] things that she had done wrong but yet
[41:16] he told her let's pray and she got to
[41:18] praying and she prayed a little bit and
[41:20] she said well I think I'm good no pray a
[41:23] little bit longer oh you got to
[41:25] sacrifice sacrif ice sacrifice yourself
[41:30] lay yourself down on the altar of
[41:32] sacrifice until God can come and do
[41:34] something with you and brother Ram would
[41:36] say if Noah seen a little leak in his
[41:38] ark why he put some pitch in it and so
[41:40] that's about the best thing I know to
[41:42] keep the leak out the world out is to
[41:43] stop up the leak stop up the leak is the
[41:46] best thing that I know to do put some
[41:49] pitch in it let the Holy Spirit grab a
[41:52] hold of your life and begin to plug up
[41:54] all those leaks so if you got a a leaky
[41:57] spot if you got imagine Noah in that Ark
[42:01] going around inspecting looking for
[42:03] leaks and all of a sudden there'd be a
[42:05] little gush of water coming in the ark
[42:06] you know to Noah with no land in sight
[42:10] that would be a scary thing now what
[42:12] about you and I when we find a leak in
[42:14] our life something that ain't right it
[42:17] should scare us it should make us it
[42:19] should make us just be on top of things
[42:21] just like Noah was and Noah would take
[42:23] that hot pitch you got you can't you
[42:25] can't just cram it in there you got to
[42:27] heat it up first that's the only way
[42:29] it'll work you take that hot pitch and
[42:31] you pour it over that wood and just let
[42:32] it soak into that wood real good and
[42:35] that'll stop the leak up now how you
[42:37] going to get pitch in your life you got
[42:38] to die out to yourself you got to die
[42:41] out to yourself where you you think oh
[42:43] I'm sure I'm sure I know the right way
[42:45] that it should go you know there's a lot
[42:47] of people in the Bible that were like
[42:48] that like Cain it's going to be my way
[42:51] my way or no way at all oh but if we can
[42:54] just die to ourself and just allow God
[42:56] to come and move on the scene in their
[42:58] lives die to our own way of thinking and
[43:01] die to oh you remember that story of of
[43:03] of when Elijah come down and he found
[43:05] that little widow woman and he he and he
[43:08] told her you need to go make me first
[43:10] make me a little cake and she took the
[43:12] meal and the oil but we always forget
[43:15] that third ingredient the two sticks the
[43:18] two sticks which represent the cross of
[43:20] self-sacrifice that you've got to die to
[43:23] yourself die to yourself and then you'll
[43:25] have a cake that you can live off of of
[43:27] then you have something real and
[43:29] something genuine that will nourish you
[43:31] and and and and and replenish you that
[43:33] will never run out that was Elijah's
[43:36] promise to that little widow woman the
[43:38] meal and the oil will never run out only
[43:42] one way to do it that's prayer prayer
[43:45] stops the leak Prayer Changes Things and
[43:48] the and the Ark the message the ark
[43:50] brother Brown will say now this soft
[43:52] goer wood when they poured this hot
[43:53] pitch over it they soaked it up right
[43:56] quick inside and out and made it a
[43:58] sealed amen oh you see it a seal soft
[44:01] soaking in the word of God Christ
[44:03] pouring the holy spirit head up it won't
[44:07] run when it's cold it's got to get hot
[44:10] what we need today is an oldfashioned
[44:13] Holy Ghost meeting head up pour down
[44:16] they took that soft goer wood the big
[44:19] Ladle and poured it on and the goer wood
[44:21] real soft ready then from the inside and
[44:24] out that pitch went through and CED it
[44:27] over like steel no water could seep in
[44:30] it at all it was a protection oh if we
[44:34] just get our lives all pitched up and
[44:37] you you know the illustration there is
[44:39] you take Pine that Pine pitch and put it
[44:41] in the gopher wood and when it soaks in
[44:43] real good it's not gopher anymore it's
[44:46] Pine cuz it's been changed oh you think
[44:49] about what the the effect of the Holy
[44:51] Ghost in your life can do it can take
[44:52] your broken messed up character and
[44:55] change you and change you what's it
[44:57] doing changing you to be like God oh
[45:00] that's the power of the Holy Ghost In
[45:01] Our Lives to change us to where we can
[45:04] walk and talk and act like Jesus and
[45:06] respond like Jesus respond to where when
[45:08] somebody smites us on the face we can
[45:11] turn the other cheek respond to where
[45:13] when somebody crucifies our influence we
[45:15] can say father forgive them oh that's
[45:17] the kind of life that I want to live I
[45:19] want to live the kind of life like
[45:21] Steven did when they stoned him and he
[45:22] was laying there dying and he said
[45:24] father forgive them to think of that
[45:26] father forgive them that's a really Holy
[45:29] Ghost fi real Holy Ghost fi life where
[45:31] you can't tell who your enemy is where
[45:33] you can't tell who you like and who you
[45:36] don't like who you agree with and who
[45:38] you don't agree with that's that's not
[45:40] hypocrisy my friends that's a holy ghost
[45:43] fre life where you can't tell whether
[45:45] somebody likes somebody or where they
[45:47] don't like somebody but where you stand
[45:50] for the truth no matter what where you
[45:52] stand for the truth and you believe God
[45:55] no matter what no matter whether you're
[45:57] friends do or don't or what the
[45:59] situation is oh if we can just shun the
[46:02] very appearance of evil brother I would
[46:04] say the whole Pentacost the world if
[46:05] they do let down don't you do it you
[46:09] stay true to God pray up live right
[46:12] associate yourself with God and his
[46:14] people and come out from among the
[46:15] worldly ungodly things that the Bible
[46:19] says you got to get the world out oh we
[46:22] got to get the world out you get the
[46:24] isn't that a principle of getting born
[46:26] again you got to get the world out first
[46:29] you got to be Sanctified you take that
[46:32] take that vessel and you wipe all the
[46:34] mud and everything out and you clean it
[46:36] out first you got to get the world out
[46:38] before Christ can come in he just won't
[46:41] associate with unbelief and things of
[46:44] the world now King joash was king during
[46:47] this
[46:48] time and he was a lukewarm borderline
[46:52] believer King
[46:54] joash he you know you read I I think
[46:56] it's interesting look at some of these
[46:58] Kings how they they come out and they
[47:00] hit the ground running they get real
[47:01] excited and they're going to go tear
[47:03] down the olive Groves and tear down tear
[47:05] down all the the the temples to bail and
[47:07] things and they go doing real good and
[47:10] then they get to listening to the people
[47:12] then they get to listening to Jezebel or
[47:14] whatever get to listening to somebody
[47:15] and they start compromising now see God
[47:18] don't want compromisers he wants
[47:20] somebody that'll have a backbone and
[47:22] stand for what's real and what's truth
[47:24] now King joash was a lukewarm border
[47:27] believer brother R will say he'd take
[47:28] out a few of the high places and where
[47:31] the Heathen worship was and he done a
[47:32] few of those things but yet he departed
[47:34] not from the sins of his father and like
[47:37] that just any way the people wanted to
[47:39] go that's the way he wanted to go God
[47:43] don't like compromisers God don't want
[47:46] his church to look like the world oh
[47:49] that's why I'm thank thank God that you
[47:51] can be a real Holy Ghost filled
[47:53] Christian that don't have nothing to do
[47:55] with the world that you can look look
[47:57] different and act different what a
[47:59] blessing that is that that that God gave
[48:01] you all these these requirements of
[48:04] things laying here of how to dress holy
[48:06] and how to look holy and live holy and
[48:09] you you can live a way that the world
[48:11] cannot live oh I I thank God when I go
[48:14] home at night and and I you know we're
[48:17] we're not we're not looking we don't
[48:19] have all the things maybe that the world
[48:20] does all the popularity and Fashions and
[48:23] everything but I look over at my little
[48:24] wife crochet in there and we got a
[48:26] little playing and we got the Bible over
[48:28] on the side you know on the table and
[48:31] and the home is peaceful you know and
[48:33] you you just you you you know it is what
[48:37] it is and I thank I thank God I thank
[48:41] God for those things thank God you
[48:43] should be proud and you should be
[48:44] thankful to be a Christian don't don't
[48:47] look at the world and think well I wish
[48:49] I could if you look at the world and
[48:50] think I wish I wish I could be like that
[48:52] there something's wrong something's
[48:54] wrong in your heart I'm so glad to be a
[48:56] Chris where I I I don't have to live
[48:58] like they do live live this hound dog
[49:01] life where you're just running around
[49:04] anyway I'll leave that but and brother
[49:07] Brown will say isn't that just exactly
[49:09] like preachers today the way the
[49:11] congregation wants to do that's the way
[49:13] the preacher PR preaches to them I want
[49:16] to tell you a God sent holy ghostborn
[49:18] preacher won't compromise with any
[49:21] congregation oh could you imagine John
[49:23] the Baptist coming out there and looking
[49:24] at the king come by that had married his
[49:26] brother's wife that wasn't even lawful
[49:28] according to the Bible and John didn't
[49:30] hold back he just preached it because
[49:32] what's a preacher's obligation is the
[49:34] truth it's not people's feelings not
[49:36] people how people feel but it's the
[49:38] truth Our obligation is the truth and
[49:40] did you know the Bible actually says
[49:42] that one day a preacher will be held
[49:44] accountable for the word that he
[49:45] preaches because if he's if he's over a
[49:47] congregation if he's over a group of
[49:49] people and he holds back and doesn't
[49:51] tell them the truth and they continue
[49:53] living in sin that it's the preacher's
[49:54] fault it's the preacher's fault he's the
[49:57] one that's going to be held accountable
[49:58] and he'll he'll stand a greater
[50:00] condemnation for not giving the truth oh
[50:02] so we can't hold back you got to just
[50:05] like John didn't hold back John had a
[50:07] backbone he had Integrity he stood for
[50:10] something you know what Integrity is
[50:12] when you stand for something that
[50:14] doesn't matter when whether somebody
[50:15] agrees with you or disagrees with you
[50:18] you going to preach it just the same and
[50:21] he preached it to a
[50:23] King he preached it he preached it if
[50:26] you ever want to make a
[50:28] stand now is the time to make a
[50:31] stand this is the time and brother R
[50:34] will say today is a compromising
[50:38] time everybody wants to look like
[50:40] everybody else everybody wants to look
[50:42] like the world you go into the
[50:44] supermarket and you see all the
[50:45] Hollywood actresses and stuff in the
[50:47] supermarket stand and women want to look
[50:49] like that you see all the Tommy rot in
[50:51] Hollywood and men want to look like that
[50:53] and live like that people getting thrown
[50:57] in jail and doing all kinds of things in
[50:59] Hollywood and just a long list of the
[51:00] horrible lives that they live and yet
[51:02] people want to live like that people
[51:04] want to look like that but they don't
[51:05] want to match up their life with with
[51:07] the Bible you know if I was going to
[51:09] match my life up with anything I want to
[51:11] match my life up with with the saints
[51:13] that lived in the early church I don't
[51:15] want to match my my life up with what
[51:17] Paul said a real Christian should be and
[51:20] I believe that a real Christian should
[51:22] be a real Christian shouldn't be halfway
[51:24] in and halfway out like King Jo
[51:27] but if you're a saint act like a saint
[51:29] act like a saint that means not not if
[51:32] you if you slip out with a cuss word
[51:34] ever now and then then you you should
[51:36] repent and act real sorry for it and not
[51:39] just be like oh well oh well you just
[51:41] got a pile on the grace cuz that's just
[51:43] how I am no God has a requirement for a
[51:46] Christian a Christian a Christian should
[51:47] be a real genuine Christian and not just
[51:50] if you're going to slip up in things
[51:52] let's go back to the Altar and make sure
[51:54] that well what really what we say we are
[51:57] instead of something that we just got to
[51:58] keep throwing this blanket of greasy
[52:00] Grace on top of until it's just so
[52:02] greasy we can't hardly live let's walk
[52:05] like a saint dress like a saint talk
[52:07] like a saint pray like a saint live like
[52:10] a saint shout like a saint be like a
[52:12] saint live a saint die like a saint and
[52:14] go to heaven like a saint if I'm going
[52:16] to be a saint I might as well do what
[52:18] the Bible says I'm going to be a
[52:20] saint in other words let's be a real be
[52:23] a real Christian I want to I want I want
[52:26] I want the devil to know what side I'm
[52:28] on I want God to know what side I'm on I
[52:31] want my fellow Believers to know what
[52:33] side I'm on I don't want to have one fit
[52:35] AC foot foot across the other side of
[52:37] the fence and and straddling everything
[52:39] and and everybody look at me well I
[52:41] wonder I wonder if they're fixing to
[52:43] leave the message any minute I wonder if
[52:45] they're fixing to lose their faith I I
[52:47] don't want people to look at me like
[52:48] that but I want to be a real genuine
[52:51] real Holy Ghost filled Christian and if
[52:53] you're not like that why don't you make
[52:55] that decision because you you might be
[52:58] the one tonight that God is looking for
[53:00] to fulfill his promises in maybe you're
[53:03] the one that God has drawing this
[53:05] borderline believer in this halfway
[53:07] lukewarm do you know the Bible said that
[53:09] this day would come it says that in the
[53:12] lay out of SE in church age they'd be
[53:13] half that lukewarm a lukewarm lukewarm
[53:16] means it's they're not hot and they're
[53:18] not cold what are they that's the
[53:22] condition of what is it is is it a duck
[53:26] it don't walk like a duck is it a
[53:29] Christian it I wonder is
[53:32] it the lean Church age would be lukewarm
[53:35] and make God sick at his stomach till he
[53:37] says in in the Book of Revelation that
[53:39] he'd SPO it from his
[53:40] mouth oh how the old saints of God used
[53:43] to sit around and sing the Redemption
[53:45] Song and sing of the blood and the power
[53:47] of God and today these are brother
[53:50] rand's words it's say cold as zero
[53:52] nearly why cuz it's it's the it's the
[53:55] spirit of the age
[53:57] the spirit of the age is to be just
[53:59] halfway
[54:00] just well right not not really he said
[54:05] you don't see their faces light up no
[54:07] more and sing and clap their hands and
[54:09] raise their hands to God and praise God
[54:11] and pray all night and lay out in the
[54:13] corn fields and things people Canon said
[54:15] in church 30 minutes without grumbling
[54:18] and growling now ain't that the truth we
[54:21] start making jokes if the service goes
[54:23] longer than 30 minutes why what is it
[54:26] because our heart's just not in it we
[54:29] just get bored with church and we just
[54:31] get tired it's it's it's I'm telling you
[54:33] it's a spiritual Condition it's the
[54:35] spirit of the age you know you can get
[54:37] the spirit of America on you you can get
[54:40] the spirit of North Georgia on you
[54:43] there's a North Georgia Spirit you can
[54:45] get the spirit of others brother said
[54:48] you go to a church and you can get the
[54:50] pastor Spirit on you you can get the
[54:52] spirit of people that are around you but
[54:54] I want that Holy Ghost spirit
[54:57] that'll be real and genuine no matter
[54:59] how how the people in North Georgia act
[55:02] how the people in America act I don't
[55:05] want to act like other people I want to
[55:07] act like God said we're going to act
[55:09] that's right oh what a day that we're
[55:11] living in like the day of joash
[55:12] borderline halfway lukewarm blowing
[55:15] blowing away tossed about wind clouds
[55:19] Without Rain tossed about never learning
[55:21] able to come to the knowledge of the
[55:22] truth that's how joash was blown blown
[55:25] around by every wi the people would say
[55:28] you need to go this way the people would
[55:30] say you need to go that way and that's
[55:32] how joash would live his life this Old
[55:35] King he thought he would just go any way
[55:36] the winds blowed tossed about by
[55:39] everything never
[55:41] stable I don't want to be like that you
[55:44] don't know what you believe maybe this
[55:47] like I was I was sharing that little
[55:48] anecdote the other day about somebody in
[55:50] another church that was saying this
[55:53] Sunday is the last Sunday of the month I
[55:55] thought I was going to going to stay
[55:57] home but then I thought no I got the day
[56:01] wrong it's not the last Sunday of the
[56:03] month so I can go now come on now God
[56:06] don't want us to be like that he wants
[56:08] you to be stable and to desire the
[56:10] sincal milk of the word of God and to
[56:13] love God and to love being around his
[56:15] people and not just be wishy-washy well
[56:17] well this is have some kind of rule that
[56:19] you make every other Sunday I'll go to
[56:22] church every other Sunday I won't
[56:27] oh if the Holy Ghost is in you he feeds
[56:29] on the word of God and not on television
[56:32] and not on true story magazines and love
[56:35] books and all that that's what people
[56:36] that just call themselves Christians
[56:38] wrap themselves up in cuz that's what
[56:40] they're feeding on their whole life is
[56:42] wrapped up in things that ain't going to
[56:44] give them any benefit and then then then
[56:47] maybe at the end of their life maybe
[56:49] they can squeeze in a death bed
[56:50] confession if the doctor don't dose them
[56:52] up with a good shot of morphine oh my
[56:54] brother and sister don't wait until then
[56:57] you might as well you might as well give
[56:59] in God now while you got time a s stable
[57:02] sound mind to think about things and
[57:05] respond in a way where you can have a
[57:07] real good repentance and lay things on
[57:10] the altar rather than wait until you're
[57:12] so drugged up at the end of the life
[57:13] that you can't even think straight oh
[57:16] don't wait my friends oh you think in
[57:20] the face of all that now to show you
[57:23] there's a hope this Old King joash heard
[57:25] that the the prophet was
[57:28] sick and he went down to visit him this
[57:32] old backslid joash halfway in halfway
[57:35] out blown around by The Winds of
[57:37] everything he went down cuz he heard
[57:39] that Elisha was sick Elisha was sick and
[57:42] the Bible says he was fixing to die and
[57:45] he didn't come irreverent he would come
[57:47] with respect he had enough God about him
[57:49] to know that he must visit this Prophet
[57:51] with respect so he walked up and wept
[57:54] over him and said my father my father
[57:57] the Chariots of Israel and the horsemen
[58:01] thereof now that's how you get something
[58:03] from God he come to that prophet and he
[58:06] said I know what you are to this
[58:09] nation that you are the very thing
[58:11] that's holding us up that your words are
[58:15] your words are like the Chariots of
[58:17] Israel your words and your prophecies
[58:20] are like the horsemen that battle for
[58:24] Israel you are you you are actually like
[58:27] the Oracle of God when I stand here at
[58:30] at your bedside I I come expecting to
[58:32] hear something that will benefit my life
[58:35] and that's the way you want to get
[58:36] something from God not just come to
[58:38] criticize not come to with jokes and and
[58:42] just making fun of things but you come
[58:44] oh you see you don't read the Bible to
[58:45] fuss about it but you read the Bible to
[58:48] live it well that's how you read the
[58:50] Bible don't read the Bible to argue with
[58:52] it and say well I think it's wrong over
[58:54] here and wrong over there and you don't
[58:55] come to church like that you won't get
[58:57] nothing from the service but you come
[58:59] ready to live it ready for it to take
[59:02] effect in your life read the Bible to
[59:05] live it and he walked down with respect
[59:08] and he wept over him because he come and
[59:10] approached it reverently God had respect
[59:13] to him and you know if God had respect
[59:16] for him because he come reverently he'll
[59:18] have respect to you if you come
[59:20] reverently that's why God said God told
[59:23] Elijah rise up I think he's on his
[59:27] deathbed and God said rise up and Elijah
[59:31] rose up oh you think about those words
[59:35] Elijah rose up and they was just about
[59:38] ready in their backslid and condition to
[59:40] be besieged by another country the
[59:42] syrians all the enemy was all around and
[59:44] you think tonight that all the enemy
[59:46] might be around you and maybe the
[59:48] devil's just got your mind and the tizzy
[59:50] and you're all frazzled and you're blown
[59:52] around by every wind of Doctrine and
[59:55] every wind of any kind of an influence
[59:57] and you don't know which is up and which
[59:59] way's down and which way is North and
[1:00:01] which way's South but because this one
[1:00:03] man humbled himself and come down before
[1:00:05] God and said oh my father how we need
[1:00:07] you God respected it and if you'll come
[1:00:11] that way God will respect your approach
[1:00:13] too and he respected Elijah and God
[1:00:16] respected him and if you'll respect
[1:00:18] God's Bible and God's holy spirit he
[1:00:21] will respect
[1:00:22] you and Elijah said go get your bow and
[1:00:26] he put an arrow in it said open the
[1:00:28] window towards the east the East is the
[1:00:30] way that Jesus will come and he said now
[1:00:33] watch now I want you to put the era in
[1:00:35] the place and draw back just as far as
[1:00:39] you can and he did he said shoot and
[1:00:44] when he shot what happened the era went
[1:00:47] out he said Get the Era and like I was
[1:00:51] saying earlier he ran out there and
[1:00:53] hunted and maybe it took him an hour
[1:00:55] maybe it took him 2 hours while Elijah's
[1:00:57] laying up there Elisha is laying up
[1:00:59] there in the bed on his on his deathbed
[1:01:02] hunting in the weeds and the overgrown
[1:01:05] grass looking for that air now that's
[1:01:08] what anybody any sensible person would
[1:01:10] do if a prophet tells you to do
[1:01:11] something you're going to go hunting for
[1:01:13] that promise if there's a promise laying
[1:01:16] in that air you're going to get that air
[1:01:18] oh if we can get desperate sometime I
[1:01:20] wonder out there looking in all those
[1:01:22] weeds if he just got desperate began to
[1:01:24] get real desperate I got to find find
[1:01:26] this because the prophet told me there's
[1:01:28] a promise laying here I got to find it
[1:01:31] and he went back and he said strike the
[1:01:33] ground and he struck the ground three
[1:01:35] times he grabbed that a and he went bang
[1:01:38] bang bang and the prophet was wroth with
[1:01:41] him he said why' you strike it why
[1:01:44] didn't you strike it more times than
[1:01:45] that why didn't you do something else
[1:01:48] about it strike it more times now that's
[1:01:51] that's an example that's a lesson for
[1:01:53] all of us we see a promise of God laying
[1:01:55] there
[1:01:56] and we go out and grab a hold of the A
[1:01:58] and we'll just barely give it any effort
[1:02:00] at all
[1:02:02] well that's good enough that's all right
[1:02:06] I went I went to church every other
[1:02:08] Sunday I read my Bible like two times
[1:02:11] this last
[1:02:12] year he said you Struck it three times
[1:02:16] you'll only have three victories and the
[1:02:18] prophet got so upset with him he said
[1:02:20] why' you why didn't you strike it more
[1:02:22] times than that the same thing has
[1:02:25] happened to tonight in the Christian
[1:02:26] church we struck the era of God's
[1:02:28] Deliverance he said it was God sent the
[1:02:31] era of Deliverance to us the era of
[1:02:34] Deliverance is the holy spirit that's
[1:02:36] been sent shot from the bow of God's
[1:02:38] love when the eternity I love the cence
[1:02:42] when the eternity to Eternity was pulled
[1:02:46] together by the cord of love God shot
[1:02:50] the era of Deliverance into the church
[1:02:52] on the day of Pentecost and the church
[1:02:56] was given in her hand what what was
[1:02:57] given in her hand she had in her hand on
[1:02:59] the day of Pentecost the promise of God
[1:03:02] that arrow that was shot through the
[1:03:04] Eastern window that the Bible says
[1:03:07] Christ is going to come from the East
[1:03:09] the church was going to given into her
[1:03:11] hand the era of God's deliverance and
[1:03:14] that Holy Spirit would deliver the
[1:03:16] church out of any kind of a chaos it
[1:03:18] could get into why cuz God doesn't
[1:03:20] forget his promises he's going to
[1:03:22] deliver you out of whatever your
[1:03:24] situation is but what we do with it we
[1:03:27] pick up the era and strike three times
[1:03:29] that's just a backsliding king strike
[1:03:32] the era once well we'll build a church
[1:03:35] we'll teach theology we'll teach
[1:03:37] psychology and have an organization oh
[1:03:39] but that's not what God wants God wants
[1:03:41] to have a holy ghost filled group of
[1:03:43] people a holy ghost filled church that's
[1:03:46] gone all the way until that Syrian Army
[1:03:48] is completely Desto destroy that's what
[1:03:51] God wanted to do is completely destroy
[1:03:53] the enemy completely destroy the en in
[1:03:56] your life not just a little halfhazard
[1:03:57] well this will be good enough God don't
[1:04:01] want us to strike short the church world
[1:04:04] tonight is still striking short God sent
[1:04:07] the baptism of the Holy Ghost and put it
[1:04:08] into the hands of the church the era of
[1:04:10] God's Deliverance to deliver from
[1:04:13] sickness from sin from worry from
[1:04:17] trouble oh if you got worry tonight
[1:04:20] that's what that era of Deliverance is
[1:04:21] for to take all that worry away cast it
[1:04:25] on him and he'll take care of it cast
[1:04:28] that worry on him all that
[1:04:31] worldliness oh if you get a hold of God
[1:04:34] he'll take that worldliness out of you
[1:04:36] from everything else but he said we've
[1:04:38] struck short of it oh to think that
[1:04:41] every promise in the book is mine that's
[1:04:43] what Elijah Elisha was telling King
[1:04:46] joash every promise is yours don't hold
[1:04:49] back don't just have a little half
[1:04:51] hearted well I'll just knock three times
[1:04:53] on the ground and that'll be enough but
[1:04:56] all come with confidence believing that
[1:04:58] there is a God on the scene to guide us
[1:05:00] and to lead us and every promise in the
[1:05:03] book is mine because a God that made the
[1:05:06] promise is on the scene to fulfill his
[1:05:08] word and make these words come off the
[1:05:10] page God made a way for you to be
[1:05:12] delivered from everything from complexes
[1:05:15] from sin sickness oh we don't have to
[1:05:18] deal with I think comp listen I think
[1:05:20] complexes are some of the worst things
[1:05:23] you talk to somebody with a complex and
[1:05:25] they're always looking behind them to
[1:05:27] searching out to find somebody that's
[1:05:29] going to be against them looking for
[1:05:31] somebody looking for a reason to find
[1:05:33] fault because they're coming with that
[1:05:35] negative Viewpoint that somebody's going
[1:05:38] to do something somebody's going to what
[1:05:40] all these complexes and complexes we
[1:05:43] know they come from all these life
[1:05:44] experiences and scars and everything but
[1:05:47] nevertheless God can get rid of it for
[1:05:50] you God can take it away if we'll just
[1:05:53] give it to him oh look at what God has
[1:05:55] given to us don't come up short we go
[1:05:58] over to the church and we join the
[1:06:00] church and we think that's all right but
[1:06:02] it ain't all right don't strike short of
[1:06:04] nothing of God's blessings if God
[1:06:07] promised the blessing of the Holy Ghost
[1:06:09] you can have it if God promised tonight
[1:06:11] healing in your body you can have it if
[1:06:14] he promised deliverance from the devil
[1:06:16] from all those fiery darts of the devil
[1:06:18] you can have it why because the Bible
[1:06:21] said that Jesus Christ is the same
[1:06:24] yesterday today and forever
[1:06:26] that's it Strike It Don't Be Afraid God
[1:06:30] said so I'm the Lord that Health thee
[1:06:33] strike it God said so it's the era of
[1:06:37] Deliverance it's brought into the church
[1:06:40] tonight but the church has been taught
[1:06:43] it's some historical thing and not put
[1:06:45] it down to a present day you remember
[1:06:47] when Elisha come over that River of the
[1:06:49] River Jordan and he got to the River
[1:06:50] Jordan after Elijah had gone up and he
[1:06:53] grabbed the mantle that had been given
[1:06:54] to him typ and the holy ghost that had
[1:06:57] fallen from Elijah and he said he struck
[1:06:59] the water and he said where is the god
[1:07:02] of Elijah come I remember somebody
[1:07:04] telling me a testimony of a little
[1:07:06] missionary down in I think it was South
[1:07:07] America they they had a need and they
[1:07:09] got to the river they got to a river
[1:07:11] that they had to get across to deliver a
[1:07:13] message because they were called to
[1:07:14] preach and they made that same
[1:07:16] declaration and the water parted and
[1:07:18] they came across why because God is
[1:07:20] still he's still the same yesterday
[1:07:22] today and forever we've heard the
[1:07:24] stories that brother Louise told of how
[1:07:26] they pour water or whatever in the gas
[1:07:28] tank and and drive because they had a
[1:07:30] need and and and story after story
[1:07:32] because God is still a god cancer being
[1:07:35] delivered from people and and and all so
[1:07:38] many miracles that how could we doubt to
[1:07:40] see that God is still on the scene he's
[1:07:43] just looking for somebody to believe
[1:07:45] where is the god of Elijah I think we
[1:07:47] know tonight we know the answer of where
[1:07:49] where the god of Elijah is he's still on
[1:07:51] the scene he's still that same God that
[1:07:54] came walking to to Abraham and and
[1:07:56] Abraham broke bread with him and and and
[1:07:59] and he began to reveal things to him and
[1:08:01] show him the things that would come he's
[1:08:02] still that same God that's still able
[1:08:05] what good what good tonight is a God in
[1:08:07] a history if isn't the same God tonight
[1:08:10] what good is a God that we can just read
[1:08:12] about what good is it if he's not still
[1:08:15] the same God of Miracles today if he
[1:08:17] isn't the same God tonight what good is
[1:08:19] he oh if I I want to challenge you
[1:08:21] tonight to take God at his word and
[1:08:23] believe him that's the kind of God that
[1:08:25] I'm preaching tonight what good would he
[1:08:27] be if he's not the same yesterday today
[1:08:30] and forever but the Bible says he is so
[1:08:32] if he's still the same that he was in
[1:08:34] the first church age all down through
[1:08:36] the 2,000 years that we've been living
[1:08:38] through he's still the same tonight
[1:08:41] because God remembers his promises so
[1:08:44] you might as well strike out you might
[1:08:47] as well strike out as a musicians come
[1:08:50] the era of Deliverance is filled with
[1:08:52] Mercy tonight given to the church what
[1:08:54] we ought to do is is pick it up and
[1:08:56] strike for the glory of God that's right
[1:08:58] and every divine blessing that God
[1:08:59] promised is yours by faith if you'll
[1:09:02] receive
[1:09:03] it he said I'll tell you my brother and
[1:09:05] sister tonight you might have thought
[1:09:07] this might be fanaticism or something
[1:09:09] but if you want step with God and take
