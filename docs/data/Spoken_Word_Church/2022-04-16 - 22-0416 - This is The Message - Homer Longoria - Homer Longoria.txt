with me if you would this more this evening in mark chapter 10 mark chapter 10 we want to look at a few verses of scripture and i'll take a thought tonight if i could just real quickly or missing your opportunity missing your opportunity amen amen you know now we know that the bride won't amen we know the bride's not but there's people can miss their opportunity can you say amen amen so the bible says amen in verse number uh excuse me verse number 17 and when he had gone forth into the way there came one running and he knelt down and he asked him good master what shall i do that i may inherit eternal life and jesus said unto him why call us down me good there's there's none good but one that's god thus thou knowest the commandment so he'd been he'd been in church all his life thou knowest the commandment do not commit adultery do not kill do not still do not bear fall witness defraud not father nor thy mother excuse me thy father and our mother and he answered and said unto him master i've got a testimony i've done this i've done this amen he said he said master all these have i observed from my youth then jesus behold him loved him so the love of god don't put you in heaven because god can't break his own word that's right amen so jesus loved him amen you know we we hear this story all the time how that jesus loves you and all of the amen and he does right yeah amen but he can't break his word for you can you say amen amen jesus loved him amen and he said one thing thou likest go thy way sell whatsoever thy has and give to the poor and thou shalt have treasures in heaven come take up thy cross and follow me heavenly father i want to thank you tonight god for being able to be here and bless your bless your word tonight father bless your people father get glory out of the service in jesus name amen you may be seated tonight amen and i want to look at that tonight by the help of the lord and amen and missing your opportunity and you say amen amen now this man amen he had every opportunity in the world to receive life amen now i understand he was not bright amen because he was not elected amen because he couldn't have missed it amen but you have an opportunity and and i want you to know brother tim we're looking at it in this hour that how many people is leaving the message amen but they had an opportunity to make it right amen because god's not a respectable person amen so he gives you an opportunity because he said he would that all come to repentance he would that all amen amen would make his transition right is that all right amen but while we see in this hour amen that there's many fallen by the wayside they had the same opportunity amen they probably kept all the commandments they probably kept all the holiness they tried to live right for year after year amen but something began to happen yeah right amen amen as this young man amen the bible said amen he said all this i've observed amen i took care of this amen and jesus said thy life is one thing right i wonder what it's going to be like brother mike when we get to the end and we see so many lacketh one thing god ain't gonna let you go in above his word god's not gonna amend faith favoritism to us right amen can i go on amen so the prophet of god says he said the rich young ruler as we call him in the bible he passed a great opportunity he passed a great opportunity amen amen why he was right at the foot of the cross he was right at the foot of christ he was right in the one that could give him life amen amen amen and i thought isn't it amazing that even jesus cannot amen change you amen if you break the word right that's true this word is so important amen right your bible tells you that heaven and earth will pass away but it's never his word never will amen amen and so therefore amen just reading this book it doesn't do it that's right it doesn't do it amen amen so it takes something as obedience yes to the word of god amen and you know we find out that the bible tells us in luke chapter 16 amen maybe the bible readers did not know this until the prophet come that this wrong man lifted up his eyes in hell right yes and he remembered right he remembered where he missed it brother madam says it like this he said herod is out in the regions of the lost remember when he missed it right amen god help us we can't just follow something we've got to be a part of something this word must mean more to you than your very necessary meat it's got to be you absolute that's the reason god rich in mercy has sent a message that you wouldn't miss it he's give every one of us he give he give the world an opportunity he traveled the world amen seven times right he amen gave the world an opportunity yes to receive god they thought they had god they thought they knew god they had observed all the laws amen that's the reason jesus said amen that day he said there's one accuses you i don't have to i don't have to accuse you there's one that you followed there's going to be one standing that day that's going to accuse us and that was the one that delivered this message amen are y'all helping me today don't you see my voice is bad praise the lord amen there's one that accuses you amen we've got to stand amen with that message of the hour i'm not giving a count for luther i'm not giving a count for wesley i'm not even giving an account for pentecost but i will give account what god has done in this hour can you say amen brother madam said this young man missed his opportunity he give it up and standing right in the presence i couldn't help but think in this hour amen how many people has walked out they get on youtube and they start expressing how wrong amen how wrong amen you got to be a part of something before you can say it's wrong [Music] are y'all with me amen amen they never was a part of it right amen it never was made real to him is that what the prophet said brother brown said it never was he said we have the bible we have the truths of it right but it was not made real the biggest part of the people you can follow something because it's good it seems right it looks right amen but when it comes right down to it you miss your opportunity and you say amen amen the prophet of god says amen so this young man was like the great rich layout of sia amen well what god did he sent a word in laodicea amen amen and you know what it was predicted to come and lay out a seal amen but the thing about it was they were so invested in the church entity they were so invested in their own creatures and they missed what god did amen and when it was presented to us chicago 1961 look what brother battle looked hey man they had an opportunity we'll come we'll be baptized are y'all with me brother brother said that they come not a one right brother said they asked for their tapes did they get them not a one but they had an opportunity they had an opportunity think about a church amen here we stand amen tonight with an opportunity that a lot of the world don't have a lot of church people don't have but you got an opportunity why because the word of god has come right to you and has failed right at your feet and brother it's what you do with it it's your opportunity trying to help the young people you can't hardly help young people when the old people's falling away look at the old people falling away yeah why would a young person want something that the old people came out right is that all right yes richly out of seal they amen they're rich they have neither nothing but they don't know that they're blind blind to what truth my bible said you shall know the truth and the truth will make you free it don't just set you free it makes you free there's a difference in making you free and setting you free yes yes yes i've been made to longoria all right huh amen so you've been made free by the word of god can you say amen amen so we have an opportunity tonight amen it don't take much it didn't take him no time amen he could have received an opportunity to change his whole life amen all of his goodness as the scripture says it's never to be remembered right amen can you say amen right about all this goodness it's not to be remembered now why he cast it to the side amen look brother adam says and the scripture says he lifted up his eyes we found him in hell right yes oh his time he has a remembrance right yes brother said you'll remember right oh yeah somebody said you quote brother branham i don't know nothing else hey i was born to catholic i was raised a protestant baptist i was baptized united pentecost i went to the osteen move and then i got saved amen amen so don't tell me about church i cut my teeth on a church pew and i wear dentures today amen each one has an opportunity amen amen amen so he says a prophet of god and the scripture says amen we find him begging trying to reach out to his kin folks amen once you've been there amen once you get a taste of that other side right you want to tell somebody else so the prophet of god tells us and the bible tells us amen he said look tell my brothers not to come here amen he looks and he sees amen what if some of our ancestors that went out lost could look back wonder what they tell you right yes yes don't miss your opportunity like we did that's right don't miss your opportunity can you say amen prophet of god says amen he said that young man was like the great like this great year lay out a cnh that we live in amen it's seen a great opportunity to invest in something but it's not popular amen oh my we're making all kinds of signs all kind of crosses everywhere amen the church hey man they're not a part of that that's right right amen to be a part amen it's not something on the cross now we don't have a jesus on the cross we can't keep jesus on a cross if you've got jesus on the cross amen he's never been alive to you can you say man he's not in the tomb today he's not in the manger where is he at he's in you tonight if he's not in you you need to get there because you've got an opportunity to get there tonight he's not in all of those other vents amen he's in a living creature tonight yes yes he is you say amen amen he's not in literally rich layout of seal he's not in this amen this young ruler yes that's right we lost him amen the prophet of god said amen if you would brother man said look he was put out of the denominations they didn't want him the rich young ruler went away sad right went away sad right yes amen and he came amen looking for life he came looking for life and he went away sad because of the that's right price it's true and amazing in it thank god hey look when my folks started following this message my wife spoke i didn't want no part of it i thought this was all crazy well you know how you are you know about your in-laws in there but you know what i didn't want that because you know why i was letting the flesh work i wouldn't let the seed of god work amen amen amen but one day something began to happen amen i had an opportunity i had an opportunity to change amen praise the lord amen i can sit back and i am and i knew i knew the baptist doctor i could tell him amen what we believed right amen i could tell you about speaking in tongues amen you know people you know people's bad enough you know you ought to know there was something wrong when they had to slap you move your jaw wiggle your jaw to get your stamina lips and who everybody knows you'd have a stamina lift there's somebody wiggling in your jaw amen brother but she wasn't smart you thought that's what happened to you we got to go and we're willing to go that avenue amen they say say a word say a word say a word say it faster faster faster well you know you say after fall you faster your teeth is going to get crossed away this is what we come up under yeah i can imagine a young ruler come up under some of it and he was tired of it you got to get tired of some of that stuff at the wall yes there's no life in it amen amen we got tired of hearing the same thing every service yeah is that all right said all right what's the truth anyhow amen but you know what amen and all of that we've been you can join up with that any time but you couldn't be birthed that's right amen you can never get birthed in it because brother brahma said you never were satisfied amen brother brown says it like this he said we staggered in one place into another right until we found this place until we found this situation yes and then man we found an anchor yeah we didn't care about the criticism we didn't care what caught people called us right amen we didn't care i mean why all we know we had found a pearl of great price amen can you say amen amen amen and so the prophet of god says the prophet of god said they amen the rich young ruler went away sad although you notice that it says here amen jesus loved him right yes huh jesus loved him right amen why he would not should perish amen everybody come to eternal life yes jesus loved him amen but why it was him turned down his opportunity that's right what jesus jesus amen could have said i can't do nothing for you that's kind of like going to a doctor amen he can't do something for you he don't just keep leading you on right i can't help you said if you don't come under the word i can't help you amen watch what he said jesus said i amen brother man said jesus behold him he loved him and he loved those he loves these people in his organization amen the people of god they love him they offer amen but the thing about it is amen when he calls them they miss your opportunity what is an opportunity the word opportunity means it's amen it's a set of circumstances that makes it possible to do something right it made it possible for this young man to have life he made it possible but he turned it down amen and tonight church amen what are we doing are we going to turn it down or we're going to say okay brother ben says it like this amen mothers and fathers expecting this young man amen his ambitions to be a great enough money to carry on amen no doubt this young man this lad he gets an opportunity right to have life amen and he turns it down yeah what kind of deal and brother batman says he said don't please don't miss your opportunity please amen every one of us is faced with an opportunity yes that's right something like brother bram said there's a little something amen speaks at your heart tricks your heart yes because you can't come to judgment amen and say god you didn't tell me that was a warning in everybody yes yes every young person there's a warning amen amen amen amen amen amen but you're faced with that opportunity do i want it or do i not right do i want it or do it not right very true amen amen you don't have to he's not going to make you but he gives you an opportunity to yeah and brother batman says don't be like the young ruler don't miss out that opportunity you love him tonight please amen like i told a church the other day i said you have a choice but you realize your choice determines your predestination yes right that's right all right amen oh y'all with me amen that's the reason amen the bible said amen in joshua he said choose you this day choose you this day whom you serve amen by him choose and show that he is predestinated right right everybody said well he's predestinated we're going to make it amen your choice it's going to fix your predestination amen amen esau's choice yes proved his predestination cain's choice
