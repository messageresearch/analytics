[8:03] in the house of the Lord if you'd like
[8:04] turning your scriptures turn back where
[8:06] we was reading this morning from Hebrews
[8:10] 13 and we'll try to continue our thought
[8:14] to try to get a point to you about
[8:15] something that I've been preaching for I
[8:18] said this morning 45 years trying to
[8:20] preach one thing and I I believe it
[8:23] remember now the uh Bible study will be
[8:26] this coming uh Saturday remember brother
[8:28] Gibby preaching this coming Wednesday
[8:31] bible study this coming Saturday
[8:33] ministers meeting second Saturday to the
[8:36] ministers fellowship meeting third
[8:38] Saturday for here and brother Ernie
[8:41] Ville and no will be with us you know
[8:43] that's all in May and we coming down to
[8:47] getting the year out of the way time is
[8:49] moving on fast so I still think they're
[8:52] trying to some way to take some time out
[8:54] of the day for us and you know and do
[8:56] that but it'll you know I know they can
[8:59] can't but I guess it's just getting
[9:02] faster maybe the older you get the
[9:04] faster everything gets I don't cuz you
[9:06] do stumble a whole lot quicker you know
[9:08] and do that Hebrews 138 yeah this
[9:11] morning I made a comment and some of the
[9:13] sisters said it I got a little bit too
[9:15] far out on what I was saying about the
[9:18] the women going and having the
[9:20] operations you know to stick theirself
[9:21] out well I could have spent an hour
[9:24] preaching quotes from Brother brandom
[9:26] about weing high heels and stretched out
[9:29] and strut it and all like that and it
[9:31] wouldn't have got to point across as
[9:33] quick so forgive me for saying things
[9:36] sometimes that are crazy just remember
[9:38] is the old man but
[9:41] remember is the
[9:43] truth if a dumb donkey said it is still
[9:46] the truth so you know maybe sometimes
[9:49] you say something and it'll it'll hit to
[9:51] people because you know it's just not
[9:53] something natural that's right right
[9:56] it's supposed to be that the sisters are
[9:58] to be humble sweet and everything but
[10:00] what are they doing now everything's
[10:02] going to the women they're going the
[10:03] whole thing is that true now that's not
[10:06] that's not we're just human beings you
[10:09] know we're just we're just people but
[10:11] remember that so you forgive me for that
[10:13] that's all right let's pray father we
[10:15] thank you Lord Jesus for your love and
[10:17] your grace unto us thank you for all
[10:20] things and we pray that you would just
[10:22] bless us with your presence and your
[10:24] love Lord that you'd forgive us of our
[10:26] human elements and phrases and thought
[10:29] thought a lot of times it's maybe it's
[10:31] not radical according to you but we just
[10:34] got one thing in mind Lord and that's to
[10:35] try to get a people to a place that we
[10:39] can see you made manifest among the
[10:41] people and we're seeing that and we
[10:43] believe it and that's why we're not
[10:45] giving up on anything Lord in this day
[10:48] we're pressing forward to the mark of
[10:49] the prize of the high calling and Lord
[10:52] just moving on in you we love you and we
[10:54] thank you just come Among Us and speak
[10:57] to our hearts and lives Lord that we may
[10:59] they see you and be guided in your grace
[11:02] forgive our sins and lead us in jesus'
[11:04] name
[11:06] amen Hebrews
[11:09] 13 5
[11:11] says let your conversation see what
[11:14] manner of Life your whole thing now
[11:16] whole thing talking workings doings and
[11:19] everything be without covetousness and
[11:23] be content with such things as ye have
[11:26] for he has said I will never leave thee
[11:29] nor forsake thee so that we may boldly
[11:32] say the Lord is my helper and I will not
[11:34] fear what men what man shall do unto me
[11:39] remember them which have the rule over
[11:40] you remember that now that's not rule of
[11:43] of lordship like we're going around the
[11:45] pastor you know it's Lord you know
[11:47] spiritual husband doctrines went around
[11:49] years ago and all kind of things but
[11:53] what is it remember them which have the
[11:56] rule over you who now who's going to
[11:59] rule over you who have spoken unto you
[12:02] the word of God that's the only rule
[12:05] that can rule over
[12:06] you outside of that it's man's rule over
[12:09] rule right it's doing thing what what's
[12:12] now whose Faith
[12:14] follow considering to Ender their
[12:17] conversation Jesus Christ the same
[12:19] yesterday today and
[12:21] forever see that's supposed to be the
[12:23] end of the
[12:25] conversation the end of all things and
[12:28] be not carried about with divers and
[12:29] strange doctrines now remember we'll get
[12:32] to it Eve's problem right couldn't
[12:35] believe Hebrews 138 see the reason
[12:38] people get carried away I'll read in a
[12:39] minute where it's just a an old
[12:41] mule that wants to do those things all
[12:44] right be not carried about with divers
[12:46] and strange doctrines for it is a good
[12:49] thing that the heart be established with
[12:50] Grace not with meats and have not pro
[12:54] profited them and have have been
[12:57] occupied them that have been occupied
[13:00] therein you may be seated the Lord add
[13:02] his Blessing to the reading of the
[13:04] word now I just want to review just a
[13:08] second and I know that what I was saying
[13:10] this morning is kind of a maybe I didn't
[13:12] get my point across but but listen
[13:16] church God is a good God Amen and he
[13:20] judges us according to our
[13:24] hearts you know and and he judges
[13:27] everybody that way
[13:29] and then you know you can't argue with
[13:32] what the prophet had to say about that
[13:35] the Heathen would even be judged by the
[13:37] how they kept their laws and lived by
[13:39] them and that they were a whole lot
[13:41] cleaner and more straight and line than
[13:44] we are you know as so-called Christian
[13:48] religious world and uh you know but
[13:52] they'll be judged by that now that's
[13:54] wonderful you know to me it is what what
[13:57] it means to you no they they got to be
[14:00] born again well okay that's
[14:04] fine but they're
[14:06] not and now you think about
[14:10] it brother Brandon said you come up to a
[14:13] place of
[14:14] repentance and you know chop off your P
[14:17] sins and and things and you're really
[14:19] believing he said sure if you die right
[14:21] there I said you're going to heaven
[14:24] y now that's you
[14:27] know but now he didn't say they were
[14:29] bride that's right he didn't say they
[14:32] had eternal life right there right you
[14:36] know he'll even relate eternal life to
[14:38] just the fact of you believing and
[14:42] repenting all right but my point is that
[14:46] I believe
[14:48] in growth
[14:50] development all right and and and then
[14:54] talking about preaching 45 years on one
[14:56] thing uh I I believe growth development
[14:59] of what we're talking about you know and
[15:03] even though I'm preach a lot of times
[15:04] the same thing I did series 10 years ago
[15:07] 15 years ago 20 years ago I know myself
[15:11] that it's always in a growth development
[15:14] going up and a little more added to it
[15:17] and a little more thoughts and a little
[15:18] more understanding to to be brought out
[15:21] of it because that's the way it's
[15:22] supposed to be all right and see even
[15:25] brother brandom now we'll get to this in
[15:28] a little bit brother randam after
[15:30] preaching 30 something
[15:32] years the Lord spoke to him and said
[15:34] Jehovah the old and Jesus of the
[15:38] new now what had he preached before
[15:42] then you
[15:44] know he had preached one true and living
[15:47] God hadn't
[15:49] he all right but my point is he didn't
[15:53] he wasn't born with full
[15:57] understanding even the Bible says about
[16:00] Jesus that he grew in Grace and
[16:03] knowledge all right so I believe that we
[16:07] need to settle down and think about it
[16:09] and that way we don't dechristianize
[16:11] somebody that don't believe the way we
[16:13] believe that's right allow that to be
[16:15] between them and
[16:17] God no matter what it is over here
[16:20] Baptist Methodist or anything around it
[16:22] let that be what it
[16:25] is no matter whether it be people of the
[16:27] message
[16:29] groups you know that argue and fuss with
[16:31] each other if you're not in our group
[16:32] you're not going to make
[16:35] it leave them alone just forget it we're
[16:39] against the doctrines that those people
[16:41] bring but not the people they're human
[16:44] beings just like you and
[16:45] I and you
[16:47] know if you haven't heard the
[16:50] truth could you be judged by the
[16:55] truth now you haven't heard it right you
[16:58] can't be judged by something that you're
[17:00] not have it heard that's right you know
[17:04] and see whatever God didn't reveals
[17:06] himself to be down Through the Ages and
[17:10] time that's what you'll be judged by
[17:12] that's right am it won't be required of
[17:15] those in the Old Testament that they
[17:17] have to have the new birth because it
[17:20] was not for them that's
[17:22] right so then you come down to the ages
[17:25] and you have like Luther preaching the J
[17:27] you live by faith
[17:29] that was the new birth of his age but
[17:32] that was not the requirement that was
[17:33] made for the next
[17:35] age the next age was required more the
[17:39] next age was required more that that's
[17:42] what I'm trying to get you to
[17:45] see I I've went through it in every form
[17:48] from former latter rain to all kind of
[17:50] ways we saying it that say I believe
[17:54] former rign teaching rign latter rain
[17:57] Rapture Harvest that you know quickening
[17:59] of it but you know what the next day
[18:02] you're standing with former rain again
[18:05] maybe you don't see that away I'm sorry
[18:08] I I don't have the ability to express
[18:10] myself but I just try to make the point
[18:13] where you can think about it I believe
[18:16] in God that deals with everybody
[18:18] individually Amen in the Gentile
[18:21] dispensation it is not a collective
[18:24] form but even in the Old Testament when
[18:27] he was dealing with Israel you still see
[18:30] him dealing with one person different
[18:32] than another one that's
[18:34] right he he's not just related to
[18:37] everything you know everybody right on
[18:39] one level and one thought
[18:43] okay children they're not required what
[18:46] adults are required right because they
[18:49] don't have the understanding that's
[18:51] right but yet who can determine what
[18:54] they are we were talking the other day
[18:56] about somebody you know I
[18:59] think little boy you know I think was
[19:03] four years
[19:04] old had a great
[19:07] understanding
[19:08] well Anna came along at about 5: and she
[19:12] wanted to be baptized I question first I
[19:15] let it
[19:16] go she asked me and I just kind of I
[19:19] didn't tell her no I didn't tell her yes
[19:21] I just kind of Let It Go he kept coming
[19:23] back to me and then I got to question to
[19:26] her about what she believed right and I
[19:28] went ahead and baptized her about 5
[19:31] years old you said I went and baptized
[19:33] well now you tell me what the age of
[19:34] accountability
[19:36] is but I tell you that it's like I said
[19:39] you don't feed a baby steak that's right
[19:42] it's got to have milk right and then one
[19:45] day it becomes
[19:47] steak right all
[19:49] right that you can't just leave them on
[19:52] milk and that's what I see about the
[19:54] people of this message
[19:56] especially we've got it right here we're
[19:58] not going to move any further we're just
[20:00] going to stay with this little Doctrine
[20:02] apart we're going to we're going to do
[20:04] this we're going to do that we're going
[20:06] to stay right here and we're not going
[20:07] to venture out
[20:09] anywhere and they're scared to death to
[20:11] hear
[20:13] any deeper
[20:16] depth now the pastors is the one that's
[20:18] going to answer for that that's that
[20:20] will be their problem because that's
[20:22] what the Bible says you stand in the
[20:24] door won't go in and won't let others go
[20:26] in they're going to have to answer that
[20:28] well what are you going to do about
[20:29] those people where you going to put
[20:33] them you know that's all I'm trying to
[20:36] get you to see I believe in a God that
[20:39] can come down irregardless of our beings
[20:44] and speak to us
[20:47] individually and direct us
[20:50] individually and lead us yes and but you
[20:54] know
[20:56] what this is a natural story story of a
[20:59] of a child that's enters kindergarten
[21:01] you know kindergarten with a small
[21:03] amount of understanding compared to
[21:06] somebody in the third grade you know or
[21:09] something a lot of difference in
[21:11] understanding but you know what it is
[21:12] all the same
[21:13] wording right it's just better
[21:17] understanding that's what I believe in
[21:19] in
[21:22] salvation Salvation then is not made on
[21:25] the basis of everybody on one
[21:29] level I I've never believed that right I
[21:33] believe that it's an individual Affair
[21:36] yes with you and God Alone amen all
[21:40] right and what he is to you he might not
[21:43] be to the next
[21:45] person but then the point is when we try
[21:48] to make
[21:50] everybody come to our level okay that's
[21:54] right then I believe we're wrong that's
[21:57] right amen right
[21:59] because that's that's not the way of
[22:00] doing
[22:02] it the prophet would
[22:04] preach 30 something years he said before
[22:07] he could preach the stature of a perfect
[22:12] man well you go listen to the message he
[22:15] said I just got this the other
[22:20] day well everybody thinks oh he was born
[22:23] with it he had everything no uhuh
[22:29] than I don't believe the Lord Jesus at
[22:32] three years old understood he was going
[22:33] to die on Calvary do
[22:38] you do he have even really full
[22:40] comprehension of
[22:42] it when he was 12 13 whatever talking to
[22:46] the lawyers
[22:48] no maybe when he entered his ministry
[22:50] did he
[22:53] no but one day it dawned on
[22:56] him
[22:59] it had become a reality to him yes
[23:02] that's all I've tried to preach to
[23:05] you for 45 years is a reality to realize
[23:09] who you
[23:10] are to realize brother brandom is
[23:13] wonderful you got to do that that's
[23:15] right but at the same time of realizing
[23:18] brother Randon brought a message I
[23:20] believe Luther brought a
[23:23] message I believe Wesley brought a
[23:25] message I believe the Baptist was a move
[23:28] of God the Methodist the Presbyterian
[23:31] the Pentecost I believe all that was a
[23:33] move of God for the time yes all right
[23:38] and I believe in that that each one of
[23:39] those can be
[23:44] bride you know you're going to say
[23:46] Luther wasn't
[23:48] bride Wesley wasn't bride Pentecost
[23:51] wouldn't ride you're in bad
[23:54] shape but I'm I'm trying to illustrate
[23:56] it what does it mean
[24:00] then Hebrews
[24:03] 13:8 is Jesus Christ the same yesterday
[24:07] today and forever yes
[24:09] amen you know that Luther I believe God
[24:13] was pleased to dwell in Luther's message
[24:17] right don't
[24:19] you it brought people from works and and
[24:23] all things you know idol worship Etc to
[24:27] reality of a living
[24:30] God that's all I'm trying to talk to you
[24:33] and and I
[24:35] about this message must become a
[24:39] reality now you would agree maybe in
[24:42] what I said this
[24:43] morning that we wondered at one time how
[24:47] is we going to get the virtues of the
[24:49] Statue of a perfect man right you know
[24:52] did we just fall air to it or did we
[24:54] just halfhazard Le or was it through
[24:57] growth develop Vel M by the opening of
[24:59] the word right all right now if you
[25:02] agree with that then you can
[25:05] see that when you first got
[25:09] converted maybe a Baptist or Methodist
[25:12] what when you was born
[25:14] again you know what he was to you in
[25:16] that new
[25:18] birth he was Hebrews
[25:21] 138 that's right you might have been as
[25:24] trinitarian as could be that's right
[25:28] but that moment of that new birth
[25:32] brought a reality of Christ to you there
[25:35] was something real I believe every age
[25:38] has to have that I believe every person
[25:41] has to have that and then put us all
[25:44] together around the world and you got
[25:46] the ministry of Jesus Christ amen
[25:49] dwelling in the bride of Christ around
[25:51] the world not not us all over it at Lula
[25:55] huhuh right I've never believed nothing
[25:58] like that never taught nothing like
[26:00] that because what I saw to begin with I
[26:04] still see God wants to live in
[26:08] individual people
[26:10] right but our biggest problem is
[26:13] doubting what he's trying to
[26:16] do
[26:19] right in
[26:22] ourselves brother random when he saw
[26:25] we'll get to it in a minute about the
[26:26] Hebrews 13:8
[26:29] it's about
[26:30] 1961 on a message on the message of
[26:33] Grace is the first time he mentions
[26:36] ining the rainbow coming down the three
[26:38] thing coming
[26:39] down and it's on a message of the
[26:42] message of Grace and he called out Lord
[26:44] what would you have your servant to do
[26:46] go ahead and pull that up brother Joe
[26:47] and let him
[26:51] read he said what would you have for
[26:53] your servant to do just then the spirit
[26:56] of the Lord came in in and said Jesus of
[26:59] the New Testament is Jehovah the
[27:05] old that wasn't in 47 or
[27:11] 33 and that's what he
[27:14] said now what did Brother random preach
[27:17] before
[27:21] then you realize if he hadn't preached
[27:24] it
[27:26] correctly God could not have spoken to
[27:29] him about the Jehovah the old and Jesus
[27:31] of the new that's right right that's
[27:34] right was he ever a trinitarian
[27:41] no he said I used to think a prophet now
[27:45] that believes in one God I used to think
[27:48] that Jesus loved me and God hated
[27:53] me he said until I found out it was a
[27:56] selfs sameed person that's right
[28:00] well do you understand what I'm getting
[28:02] at yes is it the only change his MK from
[28:06] Spirit to man that was confirming of
[28:09] course my message of
[28:14] him letting me know assured that these
[28:18] 31 years hasn't been in
[28:21] vain amen
[28:26] now but that was the first time that I
[28:28] find now you find other just don't worry
[28:31] about it read
[28:33] it that where he
[28:37] mentions Hebrews 138 in that
[28:41] way but you want to click on Hebrews 138
[28:44] and see
[28:45] about I think it's a thousand something
[28:48] times maybe that he says it you know
[28:51] what he preached Hebrews 138 before then
[28:55] yeah before 61
[29:00] right why is it then that God would so
[29:04] emphasize the point to
[29:08] him that he would see the rainbows of
[29:10] things and be a confirmation of his
[29:14] message the message he was preaching was
[29:16] the
[29:18] truth and God was coming down to confirm
[29:22] that
[29:23] message to
[29:25] him right right see that that's my whole
[29:29] point of what I'm getting at going to
[29:31] number one
[29:32] now this is the next time coming over
[29:35] which is a little bit later which is let
[29:38] let your light so shine before men uh
[29:41] paragraph or
[29:42] E1 and look what he
[29:46] says because he's referring back to the
[29:48] the light of things rainbow said Jesus
[29:52] of the New Testament is jeah the old he
[29:54] just changed his
[29:56] Veil well I sat studying that I found
[30:00] out that same word where he changed his
[30:02] countenance in the Greek didn't mean
[30:04] changing his
[30:05] mask not exactly his Veil but his
[30:09] mask it come to the place that he was
[30:12] transformed that means he changed his he
[30:15] changed that means he changed his way he
[30:19] was god Jehovah and God Jehovah changed
[30:22] himself from a spirit and became a man
[30:26] he's a son name Jehovah God which that
[30:29] was the father and this is the son being
[30:33] the same
[30:36] person so we see brother brandham then
[30:41] had deeper depths of
[30:45] understanding but I ask you a simple
[30:48] question and the question is the point I
[30:52] told my wife I said I don't know how in
[30:53] the world to get this but how can
[30:56] we brother randam always
[30:59] preached that he was Hebrews
[31:01] 138 that was him
[31:04] campaign uh slogan on his Billboards and
[31:09] the things when he went out preaching
[31:14] right was Hebrews
[31:16] 138 but then one day something
[31:21] happened that opened up to
[31:23] him right right he preached to
[31:28] seals in 50s
[31:33] something he thought he preached
[31:36] him but then one day it was opened unto
[31:42] him all right see that's what I mean
[31:46] about a God that can and all of what I
[31:48] talking about today about how that he
[31:50] judges people according to what he has
[31:53] delivered unto us yes
[31:58] and if it was a heathen that had no
[32:00] concept of Jehovah God or Jesus Christ
[32:05] and but yet he's worshiping
[32:09] idols and see your thoughts is that well
[32:12] he ain't no h for
[32:15] them the Prophet come along and
[32:18] say they'll be judged according to
[32:22] their customs and laws and
[32:26] things
[32:29] but you see we think we have it all
[32:30] figured
[32:32] out and that's why that from the
[32:34] beginning I've I've
[32:37] tried to
[32:40] express I did I believe in progressive
[32:42] revelation brother Claud I said don't
[32:44] like that Progressive he
[32:47] said that's I just ain't you know I'm
[32:49] just too don't have another word to
[32:52] use the best thing is partial to real
[32:55] realization to perfect realiz our growth
[32:59] development understanding you know as it
[33:02] keeps opening to us that what we see
[33:05] today
[33:07] tomorrow is just a foundation for
[33:09] something else and see I've taught you
[33:11] from the beginning that I believe what
[33:13] we're getting here in this world is just
[33:16] a foundation that when we get into Glory
[33:20] that we can he can speak to us without
[33:23] all of this garbage that we've got and
[33:26] we'll have an
[33:27] understanding but you know what will he
[33:30] speak to Luther like he speaks to
[33:34] you no he'll speak to Luther of his day
[33:38] that's right and his time that's
[33:41] right all
[33:44] right see don't throw off on people and
[33:47] put them out of the message or put them
[33:48] out of the out of the the
[33:51] understanding you
[33:53] know you say well what about these
[33:56] people that's got these false
[33:58] doctrines you know that are in the
[34:02] message the ones I feel for and cry for
[34:06] is the Ley people that are sitting
[34:09] there that what can they
[34:14] do they're let known in a way that's not
[34:18] telling you you leave here you're going
[34:20] to die of course some of them's that
[34:23] strong and says that thing but they're
[34:25] letting on in a way of a
[34:28] fear that they can't exist without that
[34:32] person who brought them into the message
[34:34] who led them you
[34:38] know and they'll follow them right on
[34:40] down you say what hopes are they for
[34:46] them what hopes are there for me and
[34:53] you well what do you mean Brother D I'm
[34:55] trying my best well what was you when
[34:57] you wouldn't trying to do
[35:00] it you know
[35:04] what he said I'm just trying to be
[35:08] honest and looking at something from 45
[35:11] years or trying my best to preach
[35:14] it that's right that he wants to live in
[35:20] you and
[35:21] I the way he wants to
[35:25] live right one brother around preach
[35:28] message like doors indoors right and he
[35:31] said we had doors closed that's right
[35:34] now we didn't have doors closed with a
[35:35] whole lot of garbage over in there as
[35:38] the reason it was
[35:40] closed it's just that we didn't yield up
[35:42] to God that's right to where he could
[35:44] use it that's
[35:46] right it's not that you got adultery
[35:48] behind this door that's right no
[35:52] remember it's in the heart that's right
[35:55] that's where the Holy Ghost is at
[35:58] amen we see it's because we lack
[36:01] understanding that's
[36:05] true and you you go about the
[36:08] country and you listen to the
[36:12] Ley and they'd come to me and they said
[36:14] brother Dale can I get your
[36:18] tapes I said yeah if you'll get your
[36:22] pastor to
[36:24] okay well come on now
[36:27] we're going to be dogmatic and arrogant
[36:29] about everything else when he said bless
[36:31] God I don't care what my pastor said I
[36:34] want the
[36:36] tapes but instead I can't get them go my
[36:41] pastor won't let me listen nobody
[36:46] else now you tell me it's not fear that
[36:49] the people of this message you're living
[36:55] under right
[36:57] right you tell me that's not fear why
[36:59] wouldn't you just say I don't give a
[37:01] hoot what he says I want the tape that's
[37:05] right why didn't you say that about
[37:07] brother brandom
[37:09] right oh my pastor don't believe brother
[37:14] Bram hey come on I'm too
[37:18] old I know a brother used to preach down
[37:20] in Athens nobody can't feed my people
[37:23] but
[37:24] me at the same time
[37:27] old Don gin
[37:30] and F Billy Fowler was truck drivers
[37:34] going up through Jeffersonville and
[37:36] they'd come back with brother brandom's
[37:37] tapes and he'd be preaching his way and
[37:39] ain't nobody can feed my people but me
[37:41] and there's back there pic and
[37:43] tapes to each
[37:45] other getting the
[37:51] message if you wasn't afraid then why
[37:53] are you afraid now hey that's going out
[37:56] to Hur okay okay if you wasn't afraid to
[37:59] wrestle it out about brother brandom and
[38:01] get his message why not the truth
[38:05] now yeah but I believe if I leave this
[38:07] group I don't know what to do lady told
[38:10] my wife years ago said man over in India
[38:12] that claim to be God he said does he
[38:15] believe brother Brown's message said
[38:16] well he's a little off she said well
[38:18] then forget it he ain't
[38:21] God like I said this morning about the
[38:23] man that went in wanted a couple of
[38:25] weeks off
[38:27] his
[38:29] church he was out showing him brother
[38:31] around him was wrong they said why don't
[38:33] you just
[38:34] leave I said praise the Lord
[38:38] somebody let them raise up
[38:43] amen what's the
[38:45] matter well I'm afraid no it's not
[38:49] afraid you're like my
[38:52] sister my sister everybody thought she
[38:54] was afraid of her husband
[38:57] she'd drive to
[38:59] town and she'd put a
[39:02] rock and she'd dve to town she'd pull
[39:05] back and park exactly at that
[39:09] rock everybody said she does that cuz
[39:11] she's afraid of her husband no she just
[39:14] didn't want to listen to his
[39:18] mouth she'd steal the money off of out
[39:21] of his
[39:25] pocketbook you get what I
[39:29] mean but you
[39:32] see why are we afraid to listen to
[39:35] somebody that can preach things deeper
[39:37] than
[39:41] we
[39:43] why that's the person I want to listen
[39:46] to brother Mo and I learned years ago a
[39:48] little something you'd hear everybody
[39:51] telling you how long wrong his brother
[39:53] was you know oh he's off the message
[39:57] well you know what that was the guy we
[39:58] went and listened
[40:01] to CU we figured he must have something
[40:04] that others didn't have and they're
[40:05] scared of it that's
[40:09] right I don't care for you listening to
[40:11] other people's tapes I've always told
[40:14] you that amen but I said when you bring
[40:17] it back here that I don't agree with
[40:20] we'll deal with it from the pull pit
[40:22] that's
[40:23] right I think that's my right the God
[40:26] given right of Hebrews 13:6 that's right
[40:29] 7 and 8 that's
[40:31] right that if I'm going to watch over
[40:33] you in your soul then that's the way I
[40:36] have to do
[40:38] it and I believe it that way and that's
[40:41] all I've ever done but telling you not
[40:43] to listen to nobody else I never told
[40:44] you not to listen to nobody I have told
[40:47] you to be careful what you listen to
[40:49] that's
[40:51] right and I wish you would do me one
[40:54] thing that you know I wish you would
[40:57] listen with a pive what is that word
[41:00] pive good
[41:01] word an attitude that you would pick
[41:05] apart their message like you pick me
[41:12] apart maybe that's picky I'm going to
[41:15] cond a new word Webster get
[41:19] ready but I wish you would do that you
[41:22] pick me to Pieces brother Dale you
[41:25] said
[41:27] well listen to everybody outside
[41:31] way amen people come to you and say I've
[41:34] told people so and so was I well I've
[41:36] heard her takes and I didn't hear them
[41:38] say
[41:40] it but yet you always hear the mistakes
[41:43] I
[41:44] make
[41:46] right okay got that point
[41:49] across well
[41:53] listen
[41:55] Paul was a great man we know that yes I
[41:59] said this morning he wrote the basics of
[42:01] the New Testament you know more than
[42:03] anybody
[42:04] else and brother Brown said the Great
[42:06] Book of Hebrews the word that even the
[42:09] scholars argue whether or not he wrote
[42:11] it but he said Paul wrote it he said
[42:13] because his character is there he said
[42:16] because he'd take those Old Testament
[42:17] types and things and bring them into the
[42:19] New Testament right and like I said you
[42:23] know in the communion a man that never
[42:26] never had communion with the Lord Jesus
[42:30] right you know one right the others did
[42:34] but yet he was chosen to write about it
[42:37] when none of the others even were chosen
[42:40] that's
[42:42] right now why is that but get this
[42:49] thought brother ran him up until
[42:52] 61 go back and run how many times he
[42:55] preached on Hebrews
[42:58] 13:8 but yet all at once God speaks to
[43:02] him and says Jehovah the old is Jesus of
[43:05] the
[43:08] new now what kind of a God was he
[43:10] preaching before then
[43:15] right and when we read it in a minute
[43:18] that Paul had a greater understanding in
[43:20] all of the rest of them that's
[43:24] right Paul was the only one that
[43:27] understood Jehovah the old Jesus and you
[43:30] we read it well what the rest of them
[43:35] understand did Peter and him believe in
[43:37] a
[43:38] trinity come
[43:40] on Peter was the one that was chosen
[43:43] that's right to open the door amen
[43:46] that's right to the Jew and the Gentile
[43:48] that's right and what was it based on
[43:51] what it Matthew 16 or 13 what it Thou
[43:53] Art the Christ the son of the Living God
[43:58] he was declaring himself to be the Old
[44:01] Testament Jehovah right to
[44:06] Peter
[44:07] right are we you getting a new
[44:14] God
[44:16] no Paul had a deeper Revelation that's
[44:19] right amen that's all I'm trying to get
[44:21] you to
[44:24] see this prophet
[44:26] had the
[44:30] Revelation I've never tried to say oh
[44:32] I'm going to teach something deeper than
[44:35] he does there's doctrines of that out
[44:38] there we go beyond brother Brandon we do
[44:42] no the only thing we're going to go
[44:44] beyond brother Bram
[44:45] is we're going to take a change of the
[44:48] body and he didn't get to do that
[44:52] right but I'm asking
[44:54] you
[44:56] what do you
[44:58] believe what do you
[45:02] believe about
[45:08] God do you believe the new birth you
[45:11] have inside of
[45:13] you is the same
[45:17] God that spoke to Moses from the burning
[45:22] bush
[45:24] amen
[45:27] come on the same God that was leading
[45:32] the children of Israel across the Red
[45:33] Sea
[45:34] yes well now in a
[45:38] way I've got a good one in here brother
[45:40] R said the M when it said
[45:47] that yeah so you know what kind of
[45:50] Revelation the mule had yes but what
[45:54] about it
[45:58] to say why would God so emphasize to a
[46:03] prophet that had always preached him as
[46:06] the Eternal Jehovah Elohim self-existing
[46:10] go through the Hebrew
[46:12] series and read them of all the things
[46:16] that he spoke of this great
[46:18] one and then God would appear and say
[46:21] Jehovah the old Jesus the new well I'll
[46:25] have you you know that's what I've been
[46:27] preaching the whole
[46:29] time is that what we think
[46:32] happened well now Lord what are you
[46:35] doing that far ask you what you want me
[46:37] to do or preach
[46:40] and I've been doing that all my
[46:43] life no he come out of there happy
[46:46] right he come out of there with a fresh
[46:49] Revelation that's
[46:53] right something happened within the man
[46:56] that he never forgot
[47:01] it the rest of his life he put it into
[47:04] Hebrews 13:8 but yet he had always
[47:07] believed Jesus Christ the same yesterday
[47:10] today and forever
[47:12] amen that church is all I've tried to do
[47:16] 40 something years I've tried to get you
[47:17] and I to see that there's deeper
[47:20] understanding of this message that the
[47:22] prophet has brought unto us right amen
[47:25] amen there ain't nobody to come along
[47:26] straighten this message out it don't
[47:29] need straightening out it needs somebody
[47:31] to believe
[47:35] it well brother R was wrong here brother
[47:38] was wrong there well then I guess you're
[47:40] God for yesu let me kiss your
[47:44] toe come on you can straighten him out
[47:47] you got to be almighty
[47:51] God see no people oh they'll say brother
[47:56] he showed us where brother R was wrong
[47:57] here where brother wrong here where look
[48:00] what he said he said uh 7,000 instead of
[48:04] 700 and I remember a certain
[48:07] brother we were Jeffersonville Indiana
[48:11] and someone was saying well re that's a
[48:12] type brother R never said it was a
[48:15] type he said anybody ought to know what
[48:17] the Bible said and I don't even know
[48:19] where it said 700 7,000 cuz I ain't
[48:21] never worried about
[48:22] it whatever which one it was he said it
[48:25] the other way
[48:26] but this brother was up he said see
[48:29] there now that
[48:32] prophet he just winking
[48:35] away like there was some typ in
[48:40] it when the prophet said there was no
[48:42] typ he said I just made a
[48:46] mistake well there going to be 7,000
[48:49] instead of
[48:51] 700 where is that going to bring the
[48:54] rapture
[48:56] amen but the opening of the word
[48:59] something personal to you right amen the
[49:03] only thing we can stand on to think
[49:05] about any
[49:07] Rapture right right if not we're going
[49:11] to go by the grave amen that's
[49:15] right why because types and this and
[49:18] that and this what brother supposed to
[49:20] do this this brother seven Thunders were
[49:22] supposed to be seven certain brothers
[49:24] and you had to hear those
[49:28] Brothers
[49:32] right when I happened to know some of
[49:35] them and I
[49:37] didn't care too much for
[49:40] what their thoughts
[49:43] were well that's just being stubborn
[49:46] okay I'm stubborn I don't know my trou
[49:48] I'm admitting it but what's your
[49:52] problem you're just trying to be
[49:54] stubborn and I'm stubborn
[49:57] that just makes us all stubborn it don't
[49:58] put us in the Rapture that's right now
[50:01] come on church I'm just asking you and I
[50:03] know it's making it look like I'm
[50:04] exalted so you do what you want
[50:08] to 45 years to try to get a
[50:13] church to come to a realization of who
[50:17] you are
[50:21] amen 45 years of preaching yeses Jesus
[50:25] Christ the same yesterday today and
[50:28] forever to start the first message off
[50:31] the Bride of Jesus Christ would beat the
[50:33] son of man
[50:36] 1969 oh who do you think you are I'm me
[50:39] who are you if you'd stay out of Walmart

[50:44] message
[50:46] lord well why would you talk
[50:49] well I remember a brother we used to P
[50:51] go their church and he said I didn't
[50:54] have nothing till I got down to Walmart
[50:55] mark this
[50:56] evening well that's all
[50:59] right you know but then he preached on
[51:02] women's hair and dress and
[51:08] clothes but you see I'm the dirty old
[51:11] guy well I've been it 45 years ain't no
[51:14] even changeing
[51:16] now if you don't like it you got to vote
[51:19] any time you want to for a
[51:22] pastor I got one and I mean that that to
[51:25] be God's honest truth cuz I've tried one
[51:28] thing to get you and I to see Jesus
[51:32] Christ the same yest today today and
[51:35] forever and to see that he's the
[51:38] same not just in a
[51:42] way that's
[51:45] right you find me any other statements
[51:47] right around talks about leaving your
[51:50] pastor he makes one statement he said if
[51:53] he's off the truth right you leave him
[51:57] he made another statement and said if he
[51:58] Don't Preach Hebrews 13:8 as the
[52:03] same get away from
[52:08] him
[52:11] right yeah brother Dale you just you
[52:14] know you've always been hard-headed and
[52:15] wouldn't listen to me I tried to
[52:17] straighten you out oh I had a brother do
[52:19] that with me here one
[52:21] time and I told him I I'm sorry I didn't
[52:24] get that
[52:26] I never I didn't get it he preached a
[52:28] sermon feed my sheep feed my sheep feed
[52:31] my
[52:34] sheep that's good message I enjoyed
[52:37] it later on he said you remember that
[52:39] message of feed my sheep he I tried to
[52:41] straighten you out said you just so deep
[52:43] and everything said you wouldn't feed my
[52:45] family the simple
[52:48] things I thought I thought that's what
[52:51] you're supposed to
[52:54] do
[52:57] I I thought parents you're supposed to
[52:59] feed your kids the simple
[53:01] times you know and that would help me
[53:04] what you see that makes
[53:06] me a battle
[53:09] egg but I'll face God is being a battle
[53:13] EG for trying my best to get you to see
[53:16] Jesus
[53:19] Christ we went through the series of of
[53:22] the the uh word being restored you know
[53:25] the gr went of the ground and then come
[53:27] up to the son of man and come up to the
[53:29] r being the fullness of the godhead
[53:34] bodily but you see this one brother he
[53:37] said you said that she's the fullness of
[53:38] godhead body he
[53:40] said I won't quote the rest of it you
[53:42] know he was but he just blowed it off
[53:45] like he said that third pull is only for
[53:48] brother brandham and the Lord
[53:52] Jesus well I thought brother R said it
[53:54] was
[53:56] for the
[53:57] bride and I thought he said for the
[54:01] church and I thought he said to the
[54:04] totally
[54:06] lost sure did but yet who's going to
[54:11] listen to
[54:13] me
[54:14] well the ones that listen to me that are
[54:17] the ones that I'm responsible for their
[54:19] soul to try to
[54:21] happen if not you'll get up and leave
[54:23] and go somewhere else
[54:25] but it's like I said this morning then
[54:28] is it up to me to go beg people to come
[54:30] back to church that doesn't come
[54:32] here I didn't beg them to come here to
[54:34] start with that's right I don't feel I'm
[54:37] responsible you're at home sick it's not
[54:40] for me to call you that ain't Bible it's
[54:44] for you to call me that's
[54:50] true but listen
[54:52] church do you get the simple point I'm
[54:55] trying to explain yes brother brandham
[54:59] preached always that he was God
[55:04] yes but one day it
[55:07] unfolded as he said about the shooting
[55:09] of the the the what do you call it the
[55:12] Roman candles that they go up just keeps
[55:14] going out and out and out one day it
[55:16] just opened up and God spoke to him said
[55:19] Jehovah the old is Jesus of the
[55:23] new you know he had a wonderful time
[55:26] thinking about that right that meant it
[55:30] something open to
[55:32] him something became
[55:36] personal Church what is going to bring
[55:38] the
[55:39] Rapture something personal to be in
[55:45] you one of these days I'll preach to you
[55:47] what I really mean on
[55:51] that if it's something personal to me
[55:53] and you that then we're the only ones
[55:55] that's going to get it that's the ones
[55:58] who are playing around in the sugar tit
[56:01] message
[56:03] things are not going to get
[56:07] it but I still didn't say they wasn't
[56:10] going to make the change of the body so
[56:12] now don't go
[56:15] wrong but they without us cannot be made
[56:18] perfect still applies
[56:23] today see somebody's waiting on you and
[56:27] I that's
[56:31] right but you think about
[56:34] it he's the same yesterday today and
[56:38] forever look what he says go ahead
[56:40] number two I think we got part of it
[56:47] but in the Old Testament this is all we
[56:49] would see Jesus
[56:51] 62704 84 through 86 I guess in the Old
[56:57] Testament Christ the same Christ the
[56:59] same in the New Testament and Christ the
[57:02] same
[57:03] forever then if we can see what he
[57:07] was then what he had
[57:10] been and what he will
[57:15] be then we've got
[57:17] it if we can see what he was what he is
[57:21] and what he will be we got it right what
[57:23] you got the same God that's
[57:28] right what brother around say he said
[57:30] how many gods did Israel have one God he
[57:32] said how many gods does a bride have one
[57:35] God
[57:37] right then we got it Moses said now
[57:41] you'll be like me a prophet like unto me
[57:43] then when he come what Christ that was
[57:47] he had to be what then he had in he had
[57:51] to be what he was before then
[57:56] so now let's start from right d and then
[57:59] we'll see what he will be
[58:02] forever that's the only way to make
[58:05] it same yesterday now here he was we
[58:09] find the Hebrew writer is Paul saying
[58:12] Jesus Christ the same yesterday speaking
[58:14] to the
[58:15] Hebrews and we all know that Jehovah the
[58:18] Old Testament was Jesus of the
[58:21] new and it's the Holy Spirit of today
[58:26] it's just the same God just manifested
[58:28] in three different offices and so the
[58:30] same God and all that God was he poured
[58:34] into Christ all Christ was he poured
[58:37] into the church so you see you can find
[58:40] quickly what he is the same yesterday
[58:42] today and
[58:45] forever we quote all God we quote that
[58:47] all God into Christ all Christ in the
[58:49] church but do we see it's the same God
[58:52] that's right amen that's right
[58:56] but you see when our thoughts are our
[58:58] thoughts are locked until God reveals to
[59:02] us right right until he speaks to us our
[59:06] thoughts are
[59:08] locked and our thoughts might be right
[59:11] that's right
[59:13] don't was brother brandom's thoughts
[59:16] right right when he preached one God
[59:19] from the beginning and in 61 God spoke
[59:22] to him about Jehovah the old Jesus of
[59:25] the new if his thoughts hadn't have been
[59:28] right he wouldn't have spoke
[59:31] that right right
[59:35] Y what do you understand
[59:42] yes let's just drop down we go to number
[59:46] three the voice of the
[59:48] sign paragraph 131 to get right on down
[59:51] on now notice what did Paul have the
[59:54] rest of them didn't
[1:00:01] have we believe everything brother Brown
[1:00:03] says we'll read
[1:00:06] that he had the abundance of the
[1:00:08] revelation of the word of God because it
[1:00:11] was Paul who recognized that Jesus of
[1:00:15] the New Testament was Jehovah of the
[1:00:20] old now what did the other disciples
[1:00:23] have
[1:00:27] what did they
[1:00:29] have when Peter opened the
[1:00:33] door and said Upon This Rock I'll build
[1:00:35] my church Thou Art the Christ the son of
[1:00:39] the Living
[1:00:40] God right did Peter have that
[1:00:44] Revelation did the disciples have the
[1:00:46] revelation of one true and living
[1:00:50] God come on get over in Timothy where he
[1:00:53] talks about Immortal
[1:00:58] Eternal but Paul what did he
[1:01:02] have a
[1:01:04] deeper
[1:01:07] Revelation
[1:01:09] right Hallelujah I could say that
[1:01:11] something here but he had the revelation
[1:01:13] of it he wrote it and re and revealed it
[1:01:16] because God permitted it to be added to
[1:01:18] the Bible listen to him and the word
[1:01:22] comes only by the Bible by the prophet
[1:01:25] and so then God revealed to Paul and he
[1:01:28] wrote the letters inspired and God put
[1:01:32] them in the Bible oh my revealed that he
[1:01:35] is Christ of the Old Testament because
[1:01:39] he met
[1:01:42] him well all the others met
[1:01:44] him now what does it
[1:01:47] mean Peter them ate with him fished with
[1:01:50] him what does he
[1:01:53] mean
[1:01:59] going on to the next one we'll get back
[1:02:01] to that quote in a minute to where you
[1:02:03] get a point well let me do it now yeah
[1:02:05] let's go drop 38 you there're ahead of
[1:02:07] me today where's my other
[1:02:12] notes yeah when
[1:02:14] somewhere all
[1:02:16] right this is taken from a true sign
[1:02:19] that's overlooked 1961 236 look what he
[1:02:22] says he's coming down in Paul and
[1:02:25] explaining the way in the Lord then he
[1:02:28] said except I would have be exalted
[1:02:30] above the abundance of the Revelation he
[1:02:33] had more of a revelation than Peter
[1:02:36] James John or any of
[1:02:43] them he seen him after he had been gone
[1:02:47] for maybe two years or
[1:02:49] more you remember what I said there what
[1:02:52] the thought was
[1:02:54] all of them seen him all of them hunted
[1:02:57] and fished with him
[1:03:00] you
[1:03:02] right what's he getting at look at
[1:03:05] that after he's been gone for maybe two
[1:03:08] years or
[1:03:11] more standing in a pillar of fire
[1:03:14] talking to him how much greater today
[1:03:18] 2,000 years and he still
[1:03:22] lives he had a deeper revelation look at
[1:03:24] the next one but it was greater than
[1:03:26] Peter James John I said this morning
[1:03:28] John Peter said Paul says things hard to
[1:03:31] be
[1:03:35] understood right now brother random said
[1:03:38] what he said John Peter and John Paul
[1:03:42] were not different in What
[1:03:46] doctrine am I right he said it was a
[1:03:49] difference with Peter and his actions
[1:03:51] you remember when he rebuked Peter well
[1:03:53] no Doctrine look Christ is the mystery
[1:03:56] God revealed paragraph 244 through 246
[1:04:00] Paul had something greater than even the
[1:04:02] Apostle did
[1:04:03] see they said well now what they
[1:04:09] said well I've got more of a revelation
[1:04:13] than you
[1:04:16] Paul because you know I walked with him
[1:04:21] I went fishing with
[1:04:22] him when the
[1:04:25] I heard him I sat in the boat but Paul
[1:04:28] saw him after he was dead buried rose
[1:04:32] again and expressed himself in the
[1:04:35] pillar of fire that led the children of
[1:04:39] Israel knowing Paul being a Jew would
[1:04:43] have never called that Lord unless he
[1:04:45] had seen the expression he was back the
[1:04:48] same
[1:04:50] yesterday and forever he said Paul in
[1:04:53] other words
[1:04:54] I'm the same God today that I was
[1:04:57] yesterday here I am in the same light
[1:05:01] the pillar fire that Moses talked to in
[1:05:04] the burning bush no wonder he could
[1:05:06] separate the law From Grace over in the
[1:05:09] book of Hebrews he met the same Pillar
[1:05:12] of Fire he said I am Jesus whom thou
[1:05:17] persecutest now I'm not saying that
[1:05:19] James John all of them John went that
[1:05:21] Baptist a lot of things right right but
[1:05:25] yet nobody touched Paul's
[1:05:32] Revelation there no record
[1:05:36] that just go on and forget it leave it
[1:05:39] alone look what we need go ahead to
[1:05:43] number four
[1:05:44] now this is revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:05:47] Church age book page
[1:05:49] 26 now that is the
[1:05:51] Revelation Jesus Christ is God the
[1:05:54] Jehovah the old is the Jesus of the new
[1:05:56] no matter hard how hard you try you
[1:05:58] can't prove there are three Gods but it
[1:06:01] also takes a revelation by the Holy
[1:06:03] Spirit to make you understand the truth
[1:06:07] that he is
[1:06:09] one it takes a revelation to see that
[1:06:14] the Jehovah the Old Testament is the
[1:06:16] Jesus of the new amen that's
[1:06:20] right watch what he
[1:06:23] said Satan crept into the
[1:06:27] church and blinded the people to this
[1:06:30] truth what Jehovah the old Jesus of the
[1:06:33] new and when they were blinded to it it
[1:06:37] wasn't long until the Church of Rome
[1:06:39] stopped baptizing in the name of the
[1:06:41] Lord Jesus
[1:06:43] Christ we need a revelation of Jehovah
[1:06:46] the old is Jesus of the
[1:06:49] new right we need a deeper understanding
[1:06:53] amen
[1:06:57] Paul had a deeper
[1:07:02] understanding Paul had the understanding
[1:07:04] that it was the same Pillar of Fire he
[1:07:07] metant the same Pillar of
[1:07:11] Fire that Moses
[1:07:16] met do you understand what I'm getting
[1:07:18] at
[1:07:21] yes but what Revelation did Peter
[1:07:24] John and them
[1:07:26] have when John went on to patmas and saw
[1:07:29] him as the Alpha and Omega the beginning
[1:07:32] and the ending Etc come back and wrote
[1:07:35] about the
[1:07:38] things but yet he couldn't touch Paul's
[1:07:44] Revelation but was Paul's Revelation any
[1:07:48] different than Peter's or
[1:07:51] John's and one of them reveal a trinity
[1:07:53] other revealed one God
[1:07:56] no it was just deeper understanding
[1:08:01] right now I make my statement again 45
[1:08:05] years I've tried to get you to
[1:08:08] see that this bride has got to have
[1:08:10] something
[1:08:12] personal for
[1:08:14] now Luther's age is pass Wesley's age is
[1:08:17] pass ausa street is passed brother
[1:08:20] random coming the ministry he had the
[1:08:22] things is passed
[1:08:26] now it's time for the bride to realize
[1:08:29] who she
[1:08:30] is and what did the prophet say when she
[1:08:33] realizes who she is and what she's here
[1:08:36] for what did he say said she'd be an
[1:08:39] invincible
[1:08:40] Army so what should we
[1:08:44] want well brother Dale just tell us how
[1:08:46] good we are tell us how wonderful it is
[1:08:49] tell us how sweet we all are call our
[1:08:52] names and tell everybody all the good
[1:08:54] things we've done this
[1:08:58] week what if I called all our names and
[1:09:00] told all the bad things we done this
[1:09:04] week I guarantee you you'd think I was
[1:09:07] more of a prophet for telling you the
[1:09:09] good things and I would if I told you
[1:09:11] the bad
[1:09:13] things
[1:09:16] right but do you get the point
[1:09:21] yes when a man is great as brother br
[1:09:25] him going down to number six by pass we
[1:09:28] know from the Mighty God unveiled that
[1:09:30] he's in the morph he means he changed
[1:09:32] his
[1:09:33] form right same God oh show us the
[1:09:36] father look what it he talks about God
[1:09:39] in his people everything was was put
[1:09:41] into Jesus Christ he was co-equal with
[1:09:43] the father is that right think it not
[1:09:45] work robbery but he was equal with the
[1:09:47] father I used to think God was mad at me
[1:09:50] but Jesus loved
[1:09:52] me
[1:09:56] but I come to find out that Jesus was
[1:09:58] the very Heart Of
[1:10:01] God well you know what if that's true
[1:10:04] then evidently he didn't know Jesus was
[1:10:07] the heart of
[1:10:09] God until that was made known to
[1:10:14] him right CU he said I used to
[1:10:22] than there's another one on identified
[1:10:25] Christ I used to think that you were cuz
[1:10:28] he's praying angry with me but Jesus
[1:10:31] love me but I find out now that Jesus is
[1:10:35] the very Heart Of God so I know that you
[1:10:38] loved me and suffered for
[1:10:40] me do you really believe in one
[1:10:48] God so we find that God never
[1:10:51] changes we've been through that
[1:10:54] right scanning down go on to number
[1:10:57] nine look what he says when their eyes
[1:10:59] were open and they knew him paragraph 70
[1:11:03] I say under the authority of God's word
[1:11:05] and the feeling of my own soul that same
[1:11:08] holy ghost spirits right here now in the
[1:11:11] midst of this
[1:11:15] people I claim that he's raised from the
[1:11:18] dead I claim he's alive alive forever
[1:11:21] more I claim he's the same yesterday
[1:11:25] today and forever the same in principle
[1:11:27] the same in power the same in
[1:11:31] everything oh but his Corporal
[1:11:37] body well now brother D I agree with he
[1:11:39] was assigned to brother
[1:11:42] brandom but what is it to
[1:11:47] you you don't realize you just trapped
[1:11:50] your own self by your
[1:11:51] smartness I believe he was the sign to
[1:11:54] brother brandom but what is it to
[1:11:58] you come
[1:12:00] on you mean there's another God
[1:12:04] somewhere according to
[1:12:07] Paul he said there's not another
[1:12:11] gospel
[1:12:15] right well well brother Dale I believe
[1:12:20] that in a
[1:12:22] way in a way he's the same God that was
[1:12:26] Jehovah the old as Jesus knew I I I
[1:12:28] believe in a way go ahead number 10
[1:12:32] Jesus Christ was same yesterday today
[1:12:34] and forever
[1:12:36] 63 627 paragraph 37 38 well then I'm
[1:12:41] asking this question then why can't we
[1:12:44] see him if the Bible said he is the same
[1:12:47] yesterday today and
[1:12:49] forever that doesn't mean just in a way
[1:12:57] the Bible said he's the same now to me
[1:12:59] the
[1:13:01] Bible it either is wrong or it's right
[1:13:05] now if that's not the inspired word of
[1:13:07] God then I don't know what to
[1:13:11] believe not in a
[1:13:13] way now to you that say he's not the
[1:13:18] same
[1:13:20] listen everybody open wake with me to
[1:13:23] you that say he was in brother brandom
[1:13:26] and we believe that the devil did too
[1:13:29] abely he knew that right he run from
[1:13:34] him right amen right but he's not the
[1:13:39] same
[1:13:45] today you're saying in a way he's
[1:13:48] different than he was with brother
[1:13:52] brandham no no I'm not saying he's
[1:13:56] different now you know what I preached
[1:13:58] about that he's the same yesterday today
[1:14:01] and forever and I'm talking about around
[1:14:03] the
[1:14:04] world he is the same Lord Jesus with the
[1:14:08] same Ministry the son of man the
[1:14:11] fullness of the godhead bodily dwelling
[1:14:13] in his bride around the world all
[1:14:18] right not just in Lula Georgia that's
[1:14:21] right amen true
[1:14:25] but see when you say in a way look what
[1:14:27] you're
[1:14:28] doing you know what that means you don't
[1:14:31] have a clear understanding of

[1:18:40] Christ in the days of grace and it'll be
[1:18:42] Christ forever Jesus Christ the same
[1:18:44] yesterday today and forever what a
[1:18:46] beautiful picture the Hebrew letter
[1:18:49] paints and I ask this morning or talk
[1:18:53] go to number
[1:18:56] 13 what's the biggest sin that we were
[1:18:59] talking about maybe starting the
[1:19:02] message all the great things that have
[1:19:08] happened the greatest sin that ever
[1:19:12] happened in the world that caused all
[1:19:14] the other things to
[1:19:16] happen remember Eve got confused before
[1:19:20] she had to act with the Beast right the
[1:19:24] act with the Beast was just a
[1:19:29] manifestation what sin are we against
[1:19:34] today oh we don't all these murders oh
[1:19:38] God I don't see how God to live and let
[1:19:40] this world live like this that's what we
[1:19:44] say you know
[1:19:46] what it could be my unbelief and it
[1:19:50] could be your
[1:19:51] unbelief and what I mean by that
[1:19:54] is is not the way you interpret it
[1:20:00] probably lack of understanding is one
[1:20:02] thing that's right you know lack not
[1:20:05] having to understand it not being
[1:20:07] available to understanding is one point
[1:20:11] but remember it's still
[1:20:15] sin you said well brother randman died
[1:20:17] went in the grave by sin I don't agree
[1:20:19] with that now I believe he died and went
[1:20:22] to the ground because he had to get out
[1:20:24] of
[1:20:25] here because he done said it no two of
[1:20:28] us can be here at the same
[1:20:29] time well then you're going to say Jesus
[1:20:32] went to the Grave because of unbelief
[1:20:34] now you really got a
[1:20:39] problem do you believe Jesus had any
[1:20:42] unbelief I don't believe brother random
[1:20:43] had any
[1:20:46] unbelief but he died and went by the
[1:20:49] grave abely now think about Eve then for
[1:20:52] a
[1:20:53] minute God of this evil age 65 paragraph
[1:20:58] 37 and Adam's bride believed every bit
[1:21:01] of the word all got
[1:21:04] confused on one
[1:21:08] promise that he's the same yesterday
[1:21:10] today and
[1:21:11] forever see today we failed on One
[1:21:14] Promise under the temptation of enemy
[1:21:17] face to face and now the people that's
[1:21:20] called for his name of of course is his
[1:21:24] bride she is to come in contact by the
[1:21:28] same thing not just denominational truth
[1:21:31] or something but every
[1:21:37] word now did Eve doubt any of the word
[1:21:41] God
[1:21:47] said she doubted he wouldn't keep his
[1:21:51] word
[1:21:54] now Hebrews 138 wouldn't written back
[1:21:56] there she didn't have it nailed on the
[1:21:58] walls of the Garden of Eden that she
[1:22:01] could look
[1:22:05] at so she thought he
[1:22:09] changed Satan convinced
[1:22:13] her because she done a good job remember
[1:22:16] she done a good job preaching to
[1:22:21] Satan right
[1:22:25] God has said the day you eat
[1:22:30] thereof don't take her this tree she's
[1:22:33] done a good job she had Hebrews 13:8 and
[1:22:36] a good line didn't
[1:22:41] she but
[1:22:43] remember when she began to contemplate
[1:22:46] or study upon what Satan brought to
[1:22:51] her and I've told you and I believe it
[1:22:55] we don't have it written out in verbatim
[1:22:57] words but paraphrase your thoughts or
[1:23:00] whatever you want to do the devil didn't
[1:23:02] come to Eve and say there's no
[1:23:04] God he knew better than
[1:23:08] that she had witnessed him she had seen
[1:23:10] him she knew she was a
[1:23:13] creation but you know what he convinced
[1:23:16] her he convinced her that God loved her
[1:23:19] so
[1:23:21] much that he wouldn't kill
[1:23:26] her you're not too bad what you're doing
[1:23:30] you know go God meant for you to do that
[1:23:33] and you know what God did mean for her
[1:23:35] to have children he made her yes may
[1:23:40] have been spoken word children but it
[1:23:41] would still been children and he made
[1:23:45] her and she had that longing within her
[1:23:47] as any mother why do you sisters why do
[1:23:50] you marry you you wait all of your life
[1:23:52] you struggl in life and you and then a
[1:23:55] Boy comes alone and then you just give
[1:23:57] him
[1:23:58] everything
[1:24:00] why it's the motherly
[1:24:04] Instinct that's within
[1:24:09] you and he convinced Eve
[1:24:12] that she was made for
[1:24:19] that right
[1:24:23] and the greatest sin was when
[1:24:25] she accepted him in her mind not the
[1:24:29] adulterous act on the ground with the
[1:24:33] Beast that is the attribute of
[1:24:37] unbelief the unbelief was when she
[1:24:40] doubted God keeping his
[1:24:44] word or when she thought about you know
[1:24:48] God does love
[1:24:51] me preacher one time he said to me been
[1:24:54] backslid for quite a
[1:24:56] while he said brother Dale I know I'm
[1:25:01] backslid he said but why do I still get
[1:25:05] messages just like I got them when I was
[1:25:08] serving the
[1:25:11] lord I said brother that's a
[1:25:14] gift the gift in you is drawing that and
[1:25:17] it will work he said even though I'm
[1:25:20] back lit I said yes sure
[1:25:24] will bm's a good example of it
[1:25:27] right his gift
[1:25:32] work but do you see what I'm trying to
[1:25:35] get you to say
[1:25:44] see do we really believe I got one more
[1:25:47] thought and then we'll
[1:25:49] quit well let's do 14 then we'll do 15
[1:25:52] I'll scan 14 we get down to where
[1:25:55] proving his word and I said I'd give to
[1:25:57] you paragraph 234 where brother randam
[1:25:59] says now if you belong to a church that
[1:26:01] don't believe that he's the same
[1:26:03] yesterday today and forever the same in
[1:26:06] every way that's the title on the
[1:26:08] computer of this message same in every
[1:26:11] way you get away from
[1:26:20] it but there's plenty of church she says
[1:26:22] and get up we believe in Hebrews
[1:26:25] 13:8 right well then that means then if
[1:26:29] you believe in Hebrews 138 that he's the
[1:26:31] same as he was in brother Brown's
[1:26:33] Ministry no I don't believe that
[1:26:37] now what I asked him man ofer Jeff he
[1:26:39] was talking about
[1:26:42] deity I said brother I'll go along with
[1:26:45] you on deity if you will agree with me
[1:26:47] on one point I said that brother right
[1:26:50] there he claims the baptism of the Holy
[1:26:54] Ghost laying aside all of brother
[1:26:56] brandom's gifts put him as an individual
[1:26:59] and stand him side by
[1:27:02] side I said brother Brandon got the Holy
[1:27:04] Ghost in him this man got the Holy Ghost
[1:27:05] in him I said I believe he's deity if
[1:27:08] you'll go that way with me he says oh
[1:27:14] no see he made brother brandham
[1:27:18] deity I'll agree with deity deity is a
[1:27:21] baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:27:26] amen but think of
[1:27:30] it one thing that
[1:27:34] we let's go to 15 and I'll quit let me
[1:27:37] hurry the uncertain
[1:27:40] sound John 14:12 he said and the works
[1:27:43] that I do shall you do also and Greater
[1:27:46] Works than this shall you do more of
[1:27:48] them we know the story not greater than
[1:27:51] Jesus can do because look what he done
[1:27:53] it's more right CU he's around the world
[1:27:57] right the word there absolutely look in
[1:28:00] the Greek it says more shall you do
[1:28:02] because why he was God was just in one
[1:28:05] man now God is in his whole church you
[1:28:08] see God was in one man then all men who
[1:28:11] would believe him
[1:28:13] now more than this shall you do where I
[1:28:17] go to my father and I'll return back to
[1:28:20] the light that I was that led the
[1:28:22] children of Israel through the
[1:28:24] Wilderness I will turn back to that and
[1:28:27] then in a little while and I will come
[1:28:30] again see John 14:12 The Works that I do
[1:28:34] shall you do
[1:28:35] also and now he said and more than
[1:28:41] this I'll cut the rest of
[1:28:44] them cuz Church
[1:28:47] listen we'll
[1:28:51] accept that he
[1:28:54] heals when he wants
[1:28:57] to or in a
[1:29:00] away well now I'm not throwing no Stones
[1:29:03] go across the
[1:29:04] street the man believes in Divine
[1:29:10] Healing but how do they believe it talk
[1:29:13] to chiropractor the other day he's a
[1:29:15] great wonderful
[1:29:17] guy and we were talking about he was
[1:29:20] about all the family gathered for
[1:29:22] wedding and they got up front and prayed
[1:29:23] around the people I said we had a
[1:29:25] similar thing to happen the other day I
[1:29:27] said we had a little baby that was
[1:29:29] dedicated Sunday and I said the families
[1:29:32] on both sides about 18 of them stood at
[1:29:35] the front around that baby and we prayed
[1:29:37] and dedicated that
[1:29:38] baby he said that's good I said the baby
[1:29:42] was a baby we call it the baby that
[1:29:45] Faith produced some R there in the study
[1:29:48] look it down at it you'll see it the
[1:29:50] pictures of the baby that that Faith
[1:29:52] produced I said her husband's sperm
[1:29:54] count was flat zero I said sure the
[1:29:57] doctor's done all they could
[1:30:01] do but I said one day the Lord spoke to
[1:30:04] me and says they're going to have a
[1:30:09] baby you say well why didn't you walk
[1:30:11] out and tell it because that's sometimes
[1:30:14] you can't do that everybody wants to do
[1:30:15] that because it makes it look good
[1:30:20] here but he spoke to them and said
[1:30:23] they're going to have a
[1:30:27] baby just as well as one day we were
[1:30:30] downstairs
[1:30:31] and somebody looked over at me and they
[1:30:35] said brother so and so's looking for a
[1:30:41] wife and I said yep he
[1:30:45] is and then he's got
[1:30:48] one to
[1:30:50] come
[1:30:53] I believe it was my wife she turned
[1:30:54] around and said who I said turn around
[1:30:57] and
[1:30:59] look she said you mean I said
[1:31:05] y he told me who there going brother
[1:31:08] later said why didn't you tell me about
[1:31:11] that I said didn't that's not right he
[1:31:15] told me way was going to come back to
[1:31:16] the
[1:31:19] Lord I believed it he told me later that
[1:31:23] Wade would not only do that but he would
[1:31:24] be in the ministry standing beside of me
[1:31:27] I believe
[1:31:30] that you know it come to
[1:31:36] pass he told me that the child was going
[1:31:39] to be born brother forny didn't know it
[1:31:42] I didn't tell him brother forny was
[1:31:44] preaching right here he goes walking
[1:31:46] down that aisle stops right in there
[1:31:49] somewhere about where sister Freda is
[1:31:50] sitting
[1:31:53] and he looked at the two and he said
[1:31:55] God's going to give y'all a
[1:31:57] baby I went in the office with him I
[1:32:01] said did you say what I thought he said
[1:32:04] yeah I said well now I'll tell you he's
[1:32:07] done told me they going to have a
[1:32:09] child well then they come to find out
[1:32:12] all this was the
[1:32:14] problems you know that they couldn't
[1:32:16] have a
[1:32:18] baby all the sperm count was so low this
[1:32:22] do you think that bothered me it didn't
[1:32:24] bother brother fory me and him would
[1:32:25] life and talk about
[1:32:27] it well you know what they got a baby in
[1:32:29] the pictures in there say the baby that
[1:32:31] Faith

[1:32:44] to
[1:32:47] you of things you've seen and we've been
[1:32:51] through
[1:32:53] when are we going to believe that he's
[1:32:55] the same yesterday today and
[1:32:57] forever and not be a and say in a
[1:33:01] way I say to you brother Gary asked me
[1:33:04] one time didn't mean to say that he
[1:33:07] don't care he asked me he said do you
[1:33:08] think we have the faith of the father I
[1:33:10] said yes without Reserve didn't back up
[1:33:13] a stitch you asked me today do you
[1:33:15] believe the ministry of Jesus Christ in
[1:33:18] its fullness is in the bride of Christ
[1:33:20] around the world I glor in shout
[1:33:22] hallelujah right cuz 45 years ago I
[1:33:28] looked at it and saw
[1:33:32] it I just want to be a
[1:33:34] part and if I die and go to hell I don't
[1:33:39] care cuz I've done what God give me to
[1:33:43] bring to
[1:33:45] you to preach to you Jesus
[1:33:49] Christ that you can make your own Choice
[1:33:52] that's
[1:33:53] right and be what God give
[1:33:58] you what do you think about Hebrews
[1:34:02] 13:8 what do you think about
[1:34:05] it I think he's the same yesterday today
[1:34:08] and forever in every
[1:34:13] way remember what again except he's not
[1:34:16] here in his Corporal body well that's
[1:34:19] scripture because he's not to be here in
[1:34:20] the Corporal body
[1:34:22] we're to meet him in the air and go to
[1:34:23] the Millennium with him right right but
[1:34:27] evidently the prophet must have seen him
[1:34:29] that
[1:34:31] way you know I believe when we see him
[1:34:33] that way we're going to walk off this
[1:34:37] Earth that's
[1:34:40] right you know but what everybody's
[1:34:42] wanting to do is looking at
[1:34:44] a they're spending a lot of time now
[1:34:46] talking come ahead musician they're
[1:34:48] spending a lot of time now in the
[1:34:49] newspaper talking about the big bang
[1:34:52] Theory and they've actually proven by
[1:34:54] their scientific equipments etc etc that
[1:34:58] something
[1:34:59] happened the Big Bang well brother Brown
[1:35:02] said it's a Big Bang Theory it's all
[1:35:07] right but now everybody talking about
[1:35:09] the big
[1:35:10] bang all
[1:35:16] right but you know
[1:35:18] what somebody's going to talk about one
[1:35:20] of these days days and say I'm
[1:35:26] changed and you know what it's going to
[1:35:27] take
[1:35:28] place now am I correct that you must
[1:35:32] confess your healing before you are
[1:35:35] healed is that
[1:35:36] right you must confess your salvation
[1:35:40] before you're saved that's right well
[1:35:42] what's wrong with a group of people
[1:35:44] beginning to
[1:35:46] say I'm redeemed give us that one
[1:35:49] brother dick okay I'm redeemed why can't
[1:35:52] we say that and say that we're changed
[1:35:55] yes but wait a minute we we're not

[1:35:59] the MU now here's the
[1:36:01] MU here's the big
[1:36:04] mu well we're
[1:36:06] changed he's trying to get airon to come

[1:36:12] get these big
[1:36:16] things when are we going to say it's
[1:36:19] here

[1:36:21] that's right now can I say this in one
[1:36:23] word while everybody's good and wide
[1:36:25] awake you see because I've always
[1:36:28] believed the change of these bodies the
[1:36:33] Rapture has been in process yes and I've
[1:36:37] always taught you that for 45 years the
[1:36:40] Rapture has been in process from the day
[1:36:42] you received the baptism of the Holy
[1:36:47] Ghost that day your soul was redeemed
[1:36:51] and brother randam said future home he
[1:36:53] laid claim on your
[1:36:56] body
[1:36:58] y the day you was born again started the
[1:37:03] Rapture that's right that's why ever
[1:37:06] born again believer is going to be in
[1:37:08] the
[1:37:11] Rapture oh come on you got the quote you
[1:37:13] say brother said everybody got the Holy
[1:37:15] Ghost don't go that's right he said you
[1:37:18] can have the Holy Ghost every day of
[1:37:19] your life die and go to hell too so go
[1:37:21] ahead and argue
[1:37:23] quotes but you
[1:37:28] see when are we going to
[1:37:32] save I and my father are
[1:37:34] one and the prophet said when you do the
[1:37:36] Shooks going to pull
[1:37:40] away well I think we said it long enough
[1:37:43] but I think what we need to do is start
[1:37:44] believing
[1:37:45] it and putting our whole life on
[1:37:50] it
[1:37:53] well I believe I'm redeemed I hope I'm
[1:37:54] redeemed maybe I'm redeemed so many days
[1:37:56] maybe somebody will come across the land
[1:37:58] and preach a great message and and I'll
[1:38:00] grab it that's why you see all these
[1:38:02] young preachers coming along right they
[1:38:05] get up boy they got that move we did
