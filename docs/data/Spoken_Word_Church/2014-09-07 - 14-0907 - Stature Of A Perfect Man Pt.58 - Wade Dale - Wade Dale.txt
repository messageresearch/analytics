========================================

like that's it what are we doing here we're we we're going around more of them we just keep continually going around and moving around it's like i tried to explain to them out there in oklahoma and let's just make this a total analogy of everybody if if if what we're doing produces red and red's not the body change then if we keep doing what we're doing remember what the definition of insanity is the definition of an insanity is doing the same thing over again expecting a different result everybody got that yes insanity is it doing like like drunk i've been living that for a while yeah like a drunk a drunk will get drunk let's just be honest some of you may have been there some of you not got drunk throw up say i'll never do this again i ain't never going through this no more till next friday night then they do the same thing over again expecting a different result yeah well that's what that's what i was trying to talk speak to them out there in oklahoma is chang we got to change something something's got to that we're getting the same result if red is not the body change and what we're doing is producing red then we need to change what we're doing to produce green my brother dale's always said if you start with a black dog in genesis you need to end with a white dog in revelation so then it's continuity we must keep continuity our continuity is not just believing that brother branham was a prophet he was he still is a prophet i correct people all the time brother brown was a prophet not was he still is but he's across current time he's a prophet right but that prophet is gone yes the real one he introduced was this one right here and that's christ when christ came down on sunset mountain threw william branham he introduced christ like like no one else had introduced him even john the baptist because remember the least in the kingdom is greater than john the baptist john was there to introduce jesus the first time and if you'll notice not taking away from anything of william brown on the person but remember the angel never said you will forerun the second coming of christ read your clothes the angel said your message will forerun the second coming of christ when i see the messenger is gone but the message is continuing on to get christ here amen and it's full form right which is the statue of a perfect man that's god that was jesus walking on the shores of galilee right that was the fullness of the godhead bodily from here down all right so now we're going to continue can anybody see that you know carefully okay i changed the fonts to make it as big as it could that's the biggest font they got right so let's read this right here now this is from blasphemous names now remember this is the end of the dream of sister shepard all right she kind of give you a background this is the end of her dream five streams is pouring up from here into that trough down here remember the man put honey in the box which was brotherly love see there's your keystone brotherly kindness that when he was pointed in that box remember the stuff was coming out but once he put that honey in which was brotherly kindness that held so that god could fill the person up completely because remember without brotherly kindness these kind of follow in line with each other these follow in line with each other and you keep having virtue but now once you get right up here you're getting right up to the top where everything's pushing up to the top and then there's a bar right there so that's where the faith of the father that's where peter james john paul all your new testament early church had the faith of the father so see the faith of the fathers and the virtues are not something new see brother brown didn't come to preach a new way to get the virtues peter showed us how to get them in ii peter it's been since 2000 years ago but it's been laying in the bible man's read over them but not been able to put them together to attain to that so we had a prophet come in the end time that's why brother brown had to come he had to take the loose ends he had to put this back together go into where is it where zerubbabel builds them builds them hey uh anyway zechariah zechariah right zerubbabel was a real man now what happened with zerubbabel jeruba was the one that they come in and beforehand that somebody had destroyed the temple i mean laid it to the foundation destroyed it zerubbabel's job was to build that fountain to start on the foundation that was already there and build the temple back up okay so what happened in type is down through the ages man has done away with the temple done away with the way this thing's supposed to live or the scriptures are supposed to be read so it was swept off and then zerubbabel the prophet come and starts putting the building back up all right watch elijah we know that brother branham was the what the fourth spirit of elijah right elijah elisha john the baptist brother brown and then one of the two witnesses going to jews that's the five comings of elijah now what did elijah do what did the original elijah do on mount carmel those priests tore the ark toward the sacrifice the oh thank you system throw the altar down right right they jumped on it beat on it cut themselves the bible says elijah put the altar back together well let's see that's what brother rem did he put that altar back the way the worship back together he didn't bring something new right he was just restoring back remember brother brown said this messenger of elijah does two things restore the faith of the fathers to the pentecostal babies faith of the fathers pentecostal babies through the street pentecost started with the holy ghost right here in faith down here right now original pentecost original pentecost paul p i'm not paul sorry james john peter the ones in the upper room when they were birthed into the body when god gave them the holy ghost they were right here had these virtues working in their life because they were tutored by god almighty himself for three and a half years they're the greatest preachers ever come on the face of the earth we had the second greatest preacher to come on the face of the earth brother brown to do what he had to do to bring everything back together and jesus was doing the same thing he was taking the old testament right tell him say hey temples are okay and buildings are okay sacrifices are okay but now that's all right here you know what jesus was doing so he was taking the old testament and bringing it into the new testament which is in my blood he said not the blood of bulls and goats that's the old testament right the new testament was a tech new testament in my blood so jesus was telling say hey this is the temple now then he goes out comes back on the day of pentecost and he says now you're the temple right right you're the temple no you're not you're the temple the holy ghost that's why we don't do the things that we did out in the world sure we have problems when we have problems we have tribulation but when you're a born-again christian you changed right you've changed and i ain't talking about just change one item that's right no you changed i drove by baptist church just a few minutes ago and they have an early church nine o'clock man gets out of his car with a pair of shorts on going into church with a pair of shorts on women with their pants on but you see what's happened man has rejected the word and once they've rejected the word i was reading it last night brother brown said they have become lodges so that's all they are they're just a meeting place for like the elves club or i'm sorry but that's what he said he said it's just a good fellows lodge a place to go to lodge and i don't want that to be here i don't want just to come together just to be a lodge or for us to just come and say well i gotta come to church you know i hate this it's something i hate i hate somebody say i gotta come to church so they won't say anything about me or i gotta go to church or brother wade's gonna preach on no if you don't have a desire to come to church yourself you're not born again period and it ain't me it's not me you're not what did peter say peter said you you're not lying against the holy ghost i mean you're not lying against me you're lying against the holy ghost right what do you think there's a song that we sing there are places where i can't go yeah i say where i won't go yeah because i can go with my life you can we're still free moral agents but we and you know what god and that's why i think about these virtues once you say god i know i need knowledge boy he's so happy with that i love it when deanna comes up and says papa i need you to help me in this mat with this math problem now boy you talking about making me feel good i wouldn't care if you handed me ten thousand dollars i'd give you the ten thousand back and took what she said because you know what that's part of me that's the virtue she's drawing from me the strength she's throwing for me and it may just be carnal and natural which that's okay but still the way it makes me feel well see that's the same way with god when you go to god and say god i can't understand what brother dale's saying but you said that even an illiterate person could understand this so you're gonna have to help me and you know what he's like greater than 10 billion worlds to him you know when you come to daddy and say daddy i need some help what are you going to say i'm just going to say brother said if god said i heard we can't wait i can't wait for the doors though that's right that's what i said many people in the scripture it says that much more as a day approaches i think people think we're going backwards and not approaching today because i guess one service fills you up now but you know what it's not a ritual though it should never be a ritual that's right it should never be that i'm going to come to church so that brother wade won't get onto me that's wrong you need to stay at home right but you know what if you stay at home you ain't got god in your heart right so you you can go here or there whatever you want to i told them out in oklahoma about brother ryan and sister gabby and uh we'll get to part with this one today but i told them about them their baby laying in the hospital in the intensive care unit and they are in you know what they're honoring god god said put me first that's right now you think that's something some people looked at me like they you know they were crazy i said listen a man walked out of the woods one day and there was a drought in the land he probably ain't had a bath in months hair down to here in the bible said he had camel hair around his waist he walks up to a widow woman that don't even have a husband am i okay i'm gonna preach this morning he walks up to a widow woman they don't have but one little handful of meal left they ain't got walmart to go to they don't have anywhere she's got one hand she said i'm gonna she probably got up that morning and said look son because she had a son she said son it's all we got i'm gonna bait this and feed it to you because i don't want you to die first because that's what it said right you know what the bible said a man a stranger walks up picks me some of that bread you know what he said he didn't yeah he said you made me one first now how many of you would have slammed the door in a man's face and said you go find your own when you've got a kid that's probably 50 pounds underweight having to eat and he's fixing to eat his last meal and a stranger walks up that looks like a bum off the street and goes you fix me one first that's what i thought about when i thought about them see we seek other things and you know jesus said he's even talking about funeral he said you should forsake father mother sister brother a lot of you and i'm gonna go and let it out a lot of you some of you kids will come to your house and you'll out of church that's wrong you're giving them an impression that they are more important now i'm going to tell you something my father-in-law he comes to my house on sunday he knows for a fact he's either going to sit there by himself or he's going to come to church with us there's not an option right because you know what you're presenting to them something wrong if you put them first sorry jesus said for say father mother sister brother and follow me but you know what seek ye first the kingdom of heaven then all these other things what we do is we we have fear that god's not going to do what he says that's why we're still here that's the bottom line we're afraid that god can't do and what was eve's problem eve's problem was she was afraid that god couldn't produce what he said he was going to produce that's what brother brown said right so she went ahead of god's program and produced well look at this this is what she produced evil you know all this stuff brother oh hey oh i got a message on my phone for my wife in the hospital he said we've got 20 angels in my life jillian's asleep the nylon is playing and one's reading before we went to the doctor's office i asked i said come sit down and i held a hand to pray i said don't let the day be a change for my life and by that night at four o'clock she was in there so y'all but you know what you've got to see a change in your life you're the head you're the head you're the head to be honest really we all we're the head we're talking about this last night remember we talked about them we always talk about homosexuality and everybody what's the first thing when somebody says homosexual what do you think of male 1 the bible doesn't say that the women became affected with each other first likewise the men because if the women turn against the men the men's going to do something is proven by the priest priests can't have wives so what do they do they know that's kids it's a spirit i mean it's a spirit that we get on it and it's a demon his own sister martha honestly it's the devil we don't need to pray for her as much as we need to pray that she'll be strong and we'll be strong with her to drive that unclean spirit out because it can do we can do that as a bride of jesus christ we are stronger than any demon that's right amen but now what we do is though we have fear and that's why i told ryan i said you take that fear into that room with that baby she has no defense against that that's right you understand what i'm saying they really enjoy that in oklahoma you got to think that because remember we'll do this next time remember a human doctor is only trying to keep your body alive so that your soul will stay in your body you got that because they cannot cure your soul they cannot cure your spirit they can only try to make that body function to keep that soul in that body now that's what a doctor's to do right so it doesn't matter then how many cubes are sticking in the child baby man whoever it doesn't matter what their you know the doctor says well she knows she needs this and he needs this they're just trying but see you and i though we're soul that's why i was telling ryan i said ryan you go in that room remember i said you go in that room with fear that baby's going to feel fear and it's gonna have a problem because it has nothing in that soul to combat that it's just a baby don't know any different but when you take a situation and you take the fear out and you walk in and say by his stripes they're healed and i'm not looking at how many cubes are stuck in that baby i'm not looking at how much this chart is remember brother branham with the man and the woman the the nurse says they're dying right they're dying that poor old man just put his arms around and says honey you're looking at your machines you're just looking at your machines well that's why i'm coming you're just looking at the machine the machine is trying to keep the body there go into the sole go into that soul of that person that's where this comes from virtue virtue came out of peter silver and gold have i none but such as i have he didn't have to go find it he didn't have to go call somebody he already had it so that's the same way with these virtues and as we start next sunday because we're going to have to head this thing up in christ and it's not that christ is coming he's already here okay he's here yes he was here and and let's not let's not think of this as because you go and this is from partial to perfect this is the same thing everybody understand that this is partial faith well listen if you gotta if you've got one teaspoon of ocean water brother around anybody told this this is real simple but very profound if you take one teaspoon now you've got every ingredient that's in the ocean that's billions and billions and billions of gallons you've got every element that's in that all over the world you've got in that one teaspoon everybody got that right so when you receive the new birth you get a dip you've got everything that the holy ghost includes right there in that teaspoon but now god wants to give you the whole ocean this is the whole ocean actually when we take a body change that's the whole ocean that's why brother dale's talking about the promise the prom the promise is the body change right that's our ultimate promise they couldn't receive that in the old testament they couldn't even receive the partial of the promise until they received the new birth but now see though paul says day without us but now paul become a day well now all those down do that they did receive part of the promise they received the dick but right here when we come to the end time jesus wasn't just a dip in the ocean he was the ocean he was the inexhaustible fountain he was the full ocean he wasn't a dip but now see when he come back on the day of pentecost he took little licks of fire and give it to 120 and then 3 000 and then we see the multiplication of god but now we've come down to the end time to where all those have gone on they're gone there's nothing you know paul can't help us anymore reading paul's writings can same way with brother branham he's gone but trusting what he's already said rapture and faith lays in the books and tape he didn't say oh he said in so it's not just writing it's not just reading what he said that's on the book but in the means inside inside there is a revelation that you're not going to have to come to and that's the same way with here that's why that this is one of the most ill-taught subjects in the message nobody talks about statue of perfect man they said oh you got it all when you believe well you do the teaspoon yeah of what all the elements you got right right but gordon's not satisfied with that or he just said okay now once you get that you're all ready to hear no he didn't waste space in second peter ii peter said add to your faith because brother brown said power without character we already been through this power you got the power power without these character virtues are satanic and you know what right here blasphemous names he said i'll read it in a little while i'll read it next sunday it says these virtues are a stumbling block to the unbeliever because if you're a christian and then you go out here and you throw a temper tantrum right in the middle of walmart now an unbeliever is going to look at you and go what are you what are you are you you're acting like me that's what i mean we gotta quit acting like the world we gotta try to act like god all right that's why these are godly virtues these are not man's virtues at all this has nothing to do with man once you enter into this kingdom once you enter into this kingdom the world shut out and god does this but now remember brother brown said you can stop them at any time you can stop these virtues at any time you say well i can't have temperance i just god just gets well you know what god can't help you so he's not going to override your free moral agency right up to the chains of the body he's still got to be a free moral agent or he can't judge righteously if he says that's why it's what you know a lot of these people say well i come here with eternal life that's okay in the mind of god absolutely but now when you come down here in your own body you're a sinner that's right on your way to hell right right god brings that representation down and burns out that old nature puts his soul in not brings you another one right he puts his soul in there and then you and him become vulcanized together and the only time brother around talks about vulcanizing is in the statue of a perfect man he said god vulcanizes what burns it together then you become a stature of a living god different act different talk different when i when you were talking about them what i say with them and and their baby in the situation they were in revelations 12. they overcame that fear and that demon that was trying to take their baby they didn't listen to those doctors they came right on the church and held their faith right just like a woman in in revelation 12 yet let me finish my story there's a brother out there his name is mark stiebert and he comes he came to church but his mother's like 90 years old there's nobody he has no siblings nothing to take nobody take care of his mother so he has to care he don't want to put he chooses not to put in a nursing home he's going to care for her until she dies wonderful brother he watches online and he may be watching this later on because he called me after that crying like a baby he said i feel so ashamed he said those two came to church and their baby was dying and i can't come to church and my mother's laying here i mean she's not an envelope but she just can't care for herself he's 90. right so that really put a a burden on his heart to do you know trying to do better and and you know pay attention to what's going on in the godly realm not just the human realm but in the godly realm but uh but that really touched his heart he said i feel so ashamed and you do need to be in church you need to be where you can get your fuel this is a fuel this is my refueling i have to get refueled i i get empty real quick and i get hungry real quick go ahead real quick well my problem i feel ashamed i wasn't getting my life here and then she winds up there so i feel the responsibility of the team in the center and that thing that mental problem has got to go so i'm gonna go get what it takes to get rid of that watch what you got to do you got to present yourself a living sacrifice so that people will that's what i said about an example how are you going to be you're a stumbling block if you consider yourself a christian and then you don't act like it right right you don't act like it not only people around you did you know god sees it but the people around you see it it becomes a stumbling block that's what's happened in the past because i'm a christian i'm a christian i'm a christian then we act the way we do let's go
