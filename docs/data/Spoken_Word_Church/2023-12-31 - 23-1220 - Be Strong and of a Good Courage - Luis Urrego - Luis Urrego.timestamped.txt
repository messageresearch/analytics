[26:02] praise the Lord Jesus let's go to Joshua
[26:04] chapter 1 Joshua chapter 1 and uh very
[26:09] familiar scripture but I want to I want
[26:11] to and I did not give him these
[26:13] scriptures so I do apologize back there
[26:16] but that's why we should have our Bibles
[26:18] that's
[26:19] right always have your Bibles don't
[26:21] depend on that thing all the
[26:23] time it's like brother Chris Long says I
[26:26] want to hear Pages turn
[26:28] what happened to that sound because we
[26:30] two2 dependent on those
[26:32] screens sorry it starts with a rebuke
[26:35] [Laughter]
[26:40] already um so let's Joshua chapter 1
[26:46] says now after the death of Moses the
[26:48] servant of the Lord it came to pass that
[26:51] the Lord spake unto Joshua the son of
[26:53] nun Moses's Minister saying Moses my
[26:57] servant is dead now therefore arise go
[27:00] over this Jordan thou and thou and all
[27:04] this people unto the land which I do
[27:06] give to them even to the children of
[27:09] Israel every place that the soul of your
[27:12] foot shall tread upon that have I given
[27:15] unto you as I said unto Moses from the
[27:18] Wilderness and this Lebanon even unto
[27:21] the Great River the river Euphrates all
[27:24] the land of the Hittites and unto the
[27:26] great sea toward the going down of the
[27:28] sun shall be your Coast there shall not
[27:32] any man be able to stand before thee all
[27:35] the days of thy life as I was with Moses
[27:39] so I will be with thee I will not fail
[27:42] thee nor forsake Thee I want you to just
[27:46] put your name in that in that scripture
[27:49] right there I will not forsake sister
[27:52] June I will not forsake brother Wade I
[27:54] will not forsake Brother Don I will not
[27:56] forsake sister Susan I will not forsake
[27:58] brother George put yourself in that
[28:00] scripture amen cuz that wasn't just for
[28:02] Joshua it was for you personally amen do
[28:04] you believe that the all the word of God
[28:06] is for you amen it's not wasn't just for
[28:10] the Israelites or for or or some sort of
[28:12] historical thing that we just oh look at
[28:14] it's you know something history but it's
[28:17] something personal to you and then when
[28:20] you put yourself in that scripture amen
[28:23] it it it it brings new life to it you
[28:26] see because God is an everpresent God
[28:29] Amen he's a god of now not just the god
[28:31] of yesterday and not just a god of the
[28:34] future but he's a god of now amen and he
[28:37] wants he's an everpresent help in the
[28:39] time of trouble amen praise God and then
[28:42] I I want to finish here with this
[28:44] scripture and then you you can have your
[28:45] seats it says be strong and of good
[28:48] courage verse 6 For unto this people
[28:51] shalt thou divide for an inheritance the
[28:54] land which I swear unto their fathers to
[28:57] to give them amen may God add a blessing
[28:59] to the reading of his word you may be
[29:01] seated this evening
[29:03] amen continuing here on verse seven only
[29:07] be thou strong and very courageous he
[29:10] tells him again only be thou strong and
[29:14] very courageous amen that thou mayest
[29:17] observe to do according to all the law
[29:21] which Moses my servant commanded thee
[29:24] turn not from it to the right hand or to
[29:27] the left that thou mayest Prosper
[29:30] whether soever thou goest this book of
[29:32] the law shall not depart out of thy
[29:35] mouth amen but Thou shalt meditate
[29:38] therein day and night that thou mayest
[29:42] observe to do according to all that is
[29:45] written therein for even Thou shalt make
[29:48] thy way prosperous and then Thou shalt
[29:51] have good success verse n have I not
[29:55] commanded thee so he he's he's telling
[29:57] them again and I think this is about the
[29:59] third time he said have I not commanded
[30:01] thee be strong and of good courage amen
[30:06] Be not Afraid neither be thou dismayed
[30:10] for the Lord thy God is with thee
[30:13] whether soever thou goest amen so then
[30:16] that's the that's the key verse I wanted
[30:17] to finish off there with so have not I
[30:21] commanded thee be strong and of good
[30:23] couragement amen amen yeah I believe
[30:25] it's what God wants us to have amen amen
[30:28] and this this applies to not just only
[30:30] in Good Times amen but it applies in the
[30:34] bad times as well that's when courage
[30:37] really shines amen that's when it really
[30:40] pays to Have Courage amen and so if I
[30:43] want if I just wanted to give it a
[30:45] little title tonight is be strong and of
[30:47] good courage amen be strong and of good
[30:50] courage amen we want to welcome our
[30:51] visitors here tonight God bless you
[30:53] brother good to have you with us amen um
[30:57] and so we just appreciate uh appreciate
[31:00] what the Lord gives us amen through his
[31:02] word amen amen so we notice here that in
[31:07] in Joshua Joshua was already an older
[31:09] man when God told him to do this amen he
[31:12] he he we know that he he was with Moses
[31:15] walking with Moses and following Moses
[31:18] following his message amen and he came
[31:21] to a point amen that it was time for him
[31:24] to lead the children of Israel forward
[31:27] amen and and and so I'm sure that for
[31:31] Joshua it was a scary task but he had
[31:34] seen what God did through Moses amen and
[31:37] so as as as as God was with Moses Joshua
[31:41] knew that he had to be with with him as
[31:43] well if he was to take the children of
[31:46] Israel over to the promised land right
[31:48] because why God had already made the
[31:51] promise and so the promise was for them
[31:55] and God he knew that God was one that
[31:57] cannot lie right so if God made the
[31:59] promise to them many years ago then God
[32:02] was going to fulfill that promise and it
[32:04] was about that time it was it was that
[32:07] promise was about to be fulfilled and
[32:09] Joshua didn't have any any doubt
[32:12] whatsoever that God was able to fulfill
[32:14] his promise amen it's just like us Amen
[32:17] in this hour I believe that we're we're
[32:19] we're in the end time in this I I don't
[32:21] know how you feel about it I I I you
[32:23] know the world is is going insane amen
[32:26] amen and and and and and we are in it we
[32:29] we feel the the the the the the uh it's
[32:33] it's an anointing that's upon it's
[32:35] that's upon the hour that if you don't
[32:38] know that we are living in those times
[32:41] amen then you're not seeing things the
[32:44] way right you love this world too much
[32:47] amen we should be preparing to go out
[32:50] get out of here amen and it's just like
[32:52] Joshua right here he he was preparing
[32:55] himself and the people were preparing in
[32:57] himself themselves for something because
[32:59] it was time for God's promise to be
[33:01] fulfilled just like it's time for his
[33:03] promise to be fulfilled in your life
[33:05] amen he promised us a body change we're
[33:08] on the we're on the verge of seeing that
[33:10] amen he promised us that he we would see
[33:13] our loved ones amen resurrected those
[33:15] that have gone before us amen we know
[33:18] that that's in the scripture that's got
[33:20] to be
[33:21] fulfilled cuz it hasn't been fulfilled
[33:23] yet amen we're on the cusp of that amen
[33:27] things are shaping up around the world
[33:29] things are things are are shaping up
[33:31] Amen to get you to the point amen where
[33:34] you're going to see your loved ones amen
[33:36] and from then on we we're going to be
[33:38] changed in a moment in a twinkling and
[33:39] eye and meet him in the air praise the
[33:41] Lord that's not a story that's in the
[33:43] word and if you believe the word amen
[33:45] God can't lie he's going to fulfill his
[33:48] word amen because he as he promised
[33:52] Abraham many years back amen the he he
[33:55] was going to be with Joshua amen as they
[33:57] crossed over to the to the to the
[33:59] promised land so is it going to be for
[34:01] us when we cross over into that into
[34:03] that Promised Land we know that we're in
[34:05] the promised land amen the promised land
[34:07] is this word the life in the Holy Ghost
[34:09] amen this message that we believe amen
[34:12] praise God but Joshua was an older man
[34:16] know they say that that that that uh the
[34:19] you know Colonel Sanders was the he
[34:21] built KFC when he was an when he was an
[34:24] older man and look at the empire that it
[34:27] is now and some and some will fight you
[34:30] if you know I I prefer KFC over Popeyes
[34:32] and Popeyes over KFC you know but when
[34:35] the man is whatever you want you know
[34:37] chicken is chicken to
[34:40] me it's just depends on how it's fried
[34:43] that's that's that's what I'm more
[34:44] concerned
[34:45] about what kind of oil is being used but
[34:48] anyways
[34:51] um but that that that that man built
[34:55] that that restaurant when he was an
[34:56] older man you see and so now sometimes
[34:59] we think that that Lord the Lord can't
[35:01] use us now that we're older but but you
[35:03] know what God God likes for there to be
[35:06] some maturity there amen God likes for
[35:09] there to be some some some maturity but
[35:11] we know that in the scriptures there's
[35:13] also young people that were used as well
[35:17] look at little David and and and and and
[35:19] Mary when she had God used her as a
[35:22] teenager to uh uh to give her the
[35:25] promise to fulfill something that was
[35:28] not
[35:29] even what had not even happened in the
[35:32] world before for a virgin to
[35:35] conceive that had never happened before
[35:37] and it was strange but it happened in
[35:39] Mary's life and she was only about 16 or
[35:41] 17 years old so you see God can use
[35:45] whatever he wants to use or whoever how
[35:48] how old they are it's just if they're if
[35:51] they're willing vessels am amen and
[35:54] Joshua was a willing vessel amen and
[35:57] that's what we want to be just willing
[35:58] vessels now the word courage this is
[36:02] what it means it means it's the ability
[36:04] to act on what we know is right and good
[36:09] amen and also to dare to do what we
[36:13] should or
[36:14] must all right in the hour that we're
[36:17] living in many people um we know that
[36:21] there's a lot of people that show and
[36:24] they act like they're showing courage
[36:26] right but in reality many don't even
[36:29] know what they
[36:30] believe they don't understand what they
[36:33] stand for therefore they fall for
[36:37] anything and when you don't have a goal
[36:39] when when you don't understand what you
[36:41] believe in this hour amen you are
[36:44] susceptible to fall for whatever comes
[36:46] at you it's a sad situation amen because
[36:51] there our young people and and even us
[36:53] adults if we're not careful we're
[36:55] bombarded by every angle
[36:57] Satan has got extra guns pointed at at
[37:01] the believer in this hour more than any
[37:03] other time amen because we have access
[37:07] to all kinds of information now and so
[37:11] one day we feel good with this
[37:13] particular type of information and and
[37:14] we get to binging on that right oh man
[37:18] oh this is this is good this is this is
[37:20] new and then finally we just get bored
[37:22] of
[37:23] that and and we go to the next thing to
[37:26] B joh
[37:27] oh man yeah I love like oh man this is
[37:30] this is great this is awesome no nothing
[37:32] can can beat this but again that that
[37:34] eventually gets old so then you go to
[37:36] the next thing and you're not getting
[37:40] satisfaction because it has if
[37:42] definitely if it has nothing to do with
[37:44] the word of God it does not bring you
[37:47] satisfaction it brings you temporal
[37:49] pleasure yeah and it brings you
[37:52] information but it doesn't give you that
[37:55] full satisfaction that you really desire
[37:57] that every man is really Desiring see
[38:00] each and every one of us was born with a
[38:03] thirst how many believe that you were
[38:06] born with a thirst for
[38:09] God right but Satan has come in and
[38:12] perverted that in your life and he'll
[38:14] pervert it with basketball and he'll
[38:16] pervert it with video games and he'll
[38:17] pervert it with with hentai and Anime
[38:20] he'll pervert it with with with uh
[38:23] anything right and it doesn't and it
[38:26] doesn't fulfill your your life brother
[38:30] he'll he'll he'll he'll he'll he'll come
[38:32] in with you with
[38:35] cars but Brother Don you know that
[38:37] doesn't fulfill that's right actually
[38:41] actually probably makes you frustrated
[38:42] more
[38:43] [Laughter]
[38:45] sometimes he'll he'll try to give you
[38:48] anything and I'm not saying anything is
[38:49] wrong with that but but do not allow
[38:52] those things to replace God in your life
[38:55] because God you were you were made to
[38:57] worship God and here comes Satan he
[39:00] wants to be worshiped as well so he'll
[39:02] pervert that worship and you're not
[39:05] praising you're not you're not bowing at
[39:06] the altar of a of a of a hoofed horn uh
[39:10] uh Beast like they portray Satan that's
[39:12] not what Satan does he'll just allow
[39:15] things in your life to take the place of
[39:17] what of God yes sir all right he'll
[39:19] allow things in your life to take the
[39:21] place of God Amen now what is the
[39:24] opposite of courage
[39:30] it's fear amen right that's the opposite
[39:33] of Courage amen so if you if if you
[39:36] don't have courage amen then the only
[39:38] thing that's there is fear and then and
[39:41] fear is a Tormentor abolutely amen fear
[39:44] amen will make you have bite your nails
[39:47] down all the way down to the skin and
[39:49] then you're wondering why why is it
[39:52] stinging it's because you're you're
[39:54] you're you have bitten your neck nails
[39:56] down you're so afraid of things that
[39:58] have not even happened
[40:00] yet right I've been there amen but when
[40:04] we put our confidence in the word of God
[40:06] and just encourage ourself through the
[40:09] word let God speak to you and let him
[40:12] let him say let him uh uh give you uh
[40:16] that courage Amen to move forward amen
[40:18] then things then things are different
[40:20] amen praise the Lord because fear
[40:22] paralyzes you amen fear paralyzes you
[40:26] but courage amen helps us move ahead
[40:30] amen fear fear is a paralyzer fear fear
[40:34] that's and that's what Satan wants to do
[40:36] he wants to paralyze your walk with
[40:38] Christ amen he wants to paralyze you to
[40:42] just sit there and and and soak in in
[40:45] your situation or in your or in your or
[40:48] in the way or in the way you
[40:50] feel when there's more out there here
[40:53] for you amen but he wants you to just
[40:55] sit right there in your bubble and Suk
[40:58] in your
[41:00] situation and he knows he knows that
[41:02] there's more out there for you and that
[41:03] you're capable of more therefore that's
[41:06] the reason why he has you paralyzed
[41:09] paralyzes you with fear amen
[41:12] amen fear makes you ineffective as well
[41:15] absolutely amen amen fear causes you to
[41:19] be ineffective amen when sometimes when
[41:22] you know that you're capable of doing
[41:23] something you know I I remember one time
[41:26] and this is a this is a strange uh uh uh
[41:29] uh example but I remember when I was 11
[41:32] I was about 10 years old we had gone to
[41:35] Six Flags for the first time and I had
[41:38] never been to Six Flags before and I had
[41:40] just been to the states for maybe 3
[41:43] years we went to Six Flags and I saw the
[41:46] the rids down there in at in Atlanta I
[41:48] don't even know how we even got there
[41:49] either we were living in South Carolina
[41:51] at the time uh because my dad didn't
[41:54] know the roads and the highways that
[41:56] well or anything but we got there so no
[41:59] GPS or anything and from Greenville
[42:02] South Carolina to to Six Flags I think
[42:04] is about 2 and a half hours so we got
[42:08] there and and and and there was this one
[42:10] ride do you remember the ride where the
[42:12] it's a boat that goes down like this and
[42:15] splashes
[42:16] everybody so my parents and uh my dad
[42:20] and my sisters they were trying to get
[42:22] me to get on that and I was like I ain't
[42:24] getting on that
[42:26] no and they tried to get me on there and
[42:30] I saw that they were just happy you know
[42:32] just getting it they got in the line and
[42:35] and they had a good time all I got was
[42:38] wet not from writing on the thing but
[42:41] from the splash I said I'm never getting
[42:44] on that thing well about 3 years later
[42:47] we went back to Six Flags and I grew up
[42:51] a little bit more and I said you know
[42:53] what I'm going to get on that thing
[42:56] and and and it wasn't as bad as I had
[42:59] made it out to be three years prior you
[43:02] see I made it and I actually went on it
[43:05] multiple times came out really soaked
[43:09] yeah but it was fun amen so so so it is
[43:13] it is how it is in life as well you see
[43:16] sometimes we're fearful about what what
[43:18] should we do if I should really go that
[43:20] route but if sometimes we don't know
[43:24] what the will of God is for our life
[43:25] unless we go ahead and take the
[43:28] plunge right because we're sometimes
[43:30] we're waiting for God to give us an
[43:32] audible an audible yes do it and he
[43:35] doesn't do that all the time he may he
[43:38] can and he and he and he may do that but
[43:42] he doesn't do that for the majority of
[43:44] us that doesn't happen so what it is is
[43:48] that you have to if it's scriptural all
[43:51] right there's a test if it's scriptural
[43:53] that's that's that passes that that test
[43:55] okay
[43:56] and then if if if if if you continue to
[43:59] feel that pull then plunge
[44:02] forward as you're doing that as as then
[44:06] the Lord will show you if you fail then
[44:09] we know it wasn't the will of the Lord
[44:11] if it fails if we know it wasn't the
[44:13] will of the Lord for you but if it
[44:16] succeeds then keep moving
[44:18] forward but sometimes we have to take
[44:21] but it takes courage to do that courage
[44:23] in the word right you know it it I I I
[44:27] remember I I remember one time in in in
[44:30] um in Honduras and and I I'll pull it
[44:33] the brothers can can bring up the uh the
[44:36] uh my phone here I'm going to show a
[44:39] quick video real quick being that I'm
[44:40] going to give a little a little report
[44:43] on on on our missions trip but I wanted
[44:46] to show this real
[44:50] quick this right
[44:52] here this was 2 years ago when we had
[44:55] treed up up in the mountain and I was on
[44:59] Horseback about 4 hours trekking up on
[45:02] that mountain to just go preach to some
[45:04] Believers up
[45:05] there and
[45:08] uh and this is just one part of of the
[45:12] of of the let me just go
[45:17] back one part of of of what we were
[45:20] trying to Trek some of it was even
[45:21] steeper than
[45:23] that and they told me they said you want
[45:26] to ride on Horseback or you want to walk
[45:29] I said well let me try riding on
[45:31] Horseback cuz I riding horses isn't an
[45:33] everyday thing for me so let me just go
[45:35] ahead and get on the horse well that's
[45:37] that's the majority of the road right
[45:38] there on the edge of a mountain as we're
[45:41] going up the whole
[45:43] time and I said how is this horse going
[45:45] to get through all these rocks and
[45:48] stuff but that horse has had been
[45:52] through that route many many many many
[45:54] times up and down that mountain Y and
[45:58] that's Brother Juan right
[46:01] there and we'll go ahead and pause
[46:05] it they to so what I did I said I had to
[46:08] just take courage and just get on that
[46:11] horse and just and just and just and
[46:14] just say Lord It's like that horse was
[46:17] God and the rains I'm holding on to the
[46:19] rains it's like the
[46:21] word right and I'll just let that horse
[46:24] just take me where it needs to
[46:27] and that horse got me up there I threw
[46:30] that thing I was riding on that horse
[46:31] for about 45 minutes until I had to get
[46:33] up because it was really hurting my
[46:35] legs I walked the rest of the way but I
[46:39] did not know there was many times where
[46:41] that horse was like how he would just
[46:43] jerk me back like that and I would just
[46:45] hold on but he knew how to get up there
[46:48] he did all right and it's just how it's
[46:50] just how God is God God's been this way
[46:52] before God's been you amen he
[46:56] understands being a teenager he
[46:58] understands
[46:59] being you as a human being and he's
[47:03] given us his word so all we got to do is
[47:05] just hold on to that word the word says
[47:08] it amen I believe it amen and just let
[47:11] the word guide us and lead us to the top
[47:14] amen praise the Lord Jesus because he
[47:17] has the answers he knows the way but you
[47:19] know what it takes courage to do that it
[47:22] takes courage for you to have faith in
[47:24] his word amen you can cut that off for
[47:28] now Brothers amen so uh uh that was what
[47:33] I had to do to to conquer that fear is
[47:36] just get on the horse and let the horse
[47:37] do its thing amen praise God now Isaiah
[47:41] 41 says this 41:10 says don't be afraid
[47:45] for I Am with You amen don't be
[47:48] discouraged for I am your God amen amen
[47:52] I will strengthen you and help you I
[47:55] will hold hold you up with my Victorious
[47:57] right hand amen and how many know that
[48:00] Jesus Christ is Victorious amen he
[48:02] conquered death hell and the grave he
[48:06] conquered it all and if you're part of
[48:09] him if you're in Christ amen and he's in
[48:11] you then all that's been conquered for
[48:14] you already you have the mighty
[48:16] conqueror within you praise God so why
[48:19] fear death that's right why fear the
[48:21] grave why fear all these things why why
[48:23] fear the things that are coming a ahead
[48:26] uh uh you know because I don't know
[48:28] what's coming ahead but why fear it when
[48:32] when he's already conquered
[48:34] everything otherwise you know his death
[48:37] and the burial and his resurrection and
[48:38] all of that was in vain if he didn't
[48:41] conquer death hell and the grave and he
[48:43] stood up Victorious and he said all
[48:45] power is given unto me both in heaven
[48:48] and on earth right amen and you're part
[48:51] of that amen right exactly you're part
[48:52] of that praise God amen amen so let me
[48:55] me ask you all a question where do we
[48:57] get this courage to go
[49:00] on Amen when life seems so hard and
[49:03] problems come to your life where do we
[49:06] get disc
[49:07] courage not where do we get discouraged
[49:10] yeah right but where do we get the
[49:13] courage to move on Amen and it's the
[49:17] only place to get it is the word I'm
[49:20] telling you Mom and Dad can only do so
[49:24] much your your brother can only do so
[49:27] much the pastor at the church can only
[49:29] do so much amen David said I had to
[49:32] encourage myself in the Lord when he was
[49:35] being chased by SE by Saul the King King
[49:39] Saul amen after d after David when David
[49:42] all he was trying to do was help him
[49:44] would play the would play music for him
[49:46] because Saul was demon-possessed right
[49:49] and then when he would play the music he
[49:51] was he was there at rest and then all of
[49:53] a sudden that that that left saw and Ne
[49:56] he next thing you knowah there's a
[49:58] javelin thrown at thrown at
[50:00] him and all David could do was say the
[50:04] only I can only encourage myself in the
[50:06] Lord I don't know what's going on I
[50:08] don't know what's happening to the king
[50:10] but the only thing I can do is encourage
[50:12] myself in God Amen same thing when his
[50:15] when his son amen uh Absalon raised up
[50:18] against him and he was running from his
[50:20] own son amen taking the throne from from
[50:24] David the only thing he could do is
[50:25] encourage himself in God and that's all
[50:28] we can do in this hour amen you know
[50:31] that was that was one of the things that
[50:32] helped me uh a lot during the time you
[50:35] know when when Co hit and all that you
[50:38] know because I I I I I look at the big
[50:41] picture of things and and I don't I
[50:43] didn't know what was going on and and so
[50:45] the only thing I could do was just look
[50:47] to the word and say Lord you're the one
[50:50] who has you're the one who has control
[50:52] of what's going on in the world I don't
[50:55] and I I don't have anybody to give me
[50:57] answers but you have the answer and you
[51:01] have Amen in you have exactly because
[51:04] you know the beginning from the end and
[51:06] you know that get that lifts something
[51:08] from you it lifts it it lifts that
[51:11] burden off of you it lifts that fear
[51:13] from you that lets you know everything's
[51:15] going to be okay because even if I have
[51:18] to go by the grave I'm still a winner
[51:20] that's
[51:21] right even if I have to if even if I
[51:25] have to uh you know go to the other side
[51:27] I'm still a winner amen because I'm in
[51:31] Christ Jesus amen amen see true courage
[51:34] comes from from God's word and courage
[51:37] courage is not confidence in your own
[51:39] strength but confidence in God's
[51:41] strength which is his word amen that is
[51:44] the strength Giver amen that is the
[51:47] strength Giver praise the Lord sometimes
[51:49] God will remove things from our life
[51:52] automatically right you know but but
[51:55] sometimes he
[51:57] doesn't sometimes he knows that that's
[51:59] what you need to keep you
[52:00] humble all right Paul had a a little
[52:04] thorn in his flesh that that he asked
[52:07] God multiple times to take it away from
[52:10] him and God said no my grace is
[52:12] sufficient right right just trust in my
[52:15] grace amen and where do we find his
[52:17] grace in his word amen trust in God's
[52:20] grace not that that that'll help you
[52:23] through amen but I he won't take things
[52:25] away from us when he knows that that
[52:27] thing is keeping us humble Amen in your
[52:31] life amen praise God Amen and and and so
[52:36] you know the Holy Spirit it gives us the
[52:39] boldness Amen to to to move forward you
[52:42] see the the disciples amen they went to
[52:45] the upper room they were scared after
[52:48] Jesus died right they were scared of the
[52:51] Jews they they knew that the they that
[52:53] the Jews knew that they had been with
[52:55] Jesus and and they were scared they
[52:57] didn't even want to go out amen but when
[52:59] they got the Holy Ghost amen they threw
[53:03] open the windows flung open the the the
[53:05] the the doors and preach the word amen
[53:08] amen they got boldness yes amen right
[53:12] they got courage to do that amen so
[53:14] courage comes from the word and what the
[53:16] what is the word the word is life amen
[53:18] amen the word gives you life amen to
[53:21] move forward to plunge ahead when you
[53:23] don't want to right or when you feel
[53:26] like you can't amen it gives you that Mo
[53:28] it's a it's a motivator and and and and
[53:31] and and so that's what Peter had to had
[53:34] to have and because of his sermon amen
[53:36] 3,000 were added to the kingdom that day
[53:40] amen few days before that he wouldn't do
[53:43] that he wouldn't dare do that right he
[53:46] was still he was still there uh uh with
[53:48] the fear of of of of of having denied
[53:53] Jesus and all of that still probably
[53:56] Satan still using that bombarding him in
[53:58] his head even though Jesus had already
[54:00] appeared to them in the shore and cooked
[54:02] the and and and cooked fish with them
[54:04] and ate fish and and did all of that
[54:07] with them and but Satan's probably still
[54:09] bombarding them with with fear and
[54:11] torment and condemnation but when that
[54:14] Holy Ghost came in it was different then
[54:17] amen when you have an experience with
[54:19] God Amen it's different then you're not
[54:21] afraid what the world says you're not
[54:23] afraid what your friends say You're Not
[54:25] Afraid what whoever whoever what
[54:27] whatever may think amen you go in amen
[54:30] because the word is backing you up yes
[54:32] am amen and when the word backs you up
[54:34] amen then no devil in hell amen can come
[54:37] against you they can come against you
[54:39] but you're you they can't defeat you
[54:42] because they've been defeated praise God
[54:45] praise the Lord Jesus
[54:48] amen so this one's here for our young
[54:50] people amen how how do you find the
[54:53] courage to stand to stand firm on your
[54:56] convictions amen you know it was one of
[54:59] the things that we were dealing with and
[55:01] brother Aaron shared it uh this on
[55:04] Sunday that um we were trying to at the
[55:08] Youth Camp there in Honduras we were
[55:09] trying to help uh their our young people
[55:12] to understand and to know what they
[55:16] believe right uh some of us do not
[55:20] understand what we
[55:21] believe and and and if you don't
[55:24] understand what we believe then Satan
[55:26] will just pull all kinds of things
[55:28] around you and and so we were trying to
[55:31] say why do we believe that that God sent
[55:33] a prophet why do we believe that baptism
[55:36] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ is
[55:38] scriptural why give us a reason amen
[55:41] what does Malachi 4 amen verses 5 4 5
[55:45] and 6 what is that what is that what is
[55:47] Revelations 10:7 all those foundational
[55:50] message things
[55:53] amen and some of them you know you would
[55:55] ask the questions and they they did not
[55:57] know the answers foundational message
[56:00] things they did not know the answers so
[56:04] there's still a lot of work to
[56:06] do but you know what we can't all do it
[56:10] I can't give you all the answers and I
[56:12] can't I can't go over there and pump
[56:14] them in your head and it takes a
[56:15] relationship between you and God it
[56:18] takes a desire for you to want to know
[56:20] more about the word then you will be
[56:23] able to understand what the word is
[56:26] about amen but in Esther chapter 3: 2 it
[56:30] says but Mori refused to bow down or
[56:34] show hmon respect amen I like that story
[56:39] amen he defied hmon because hmon hmon uh
[56:43] uh he uh he the way he disrespected or
[56:47] the he he just didn't like Hon's
[56:50] uh what what his his his intentions you
[56:54] see and so uh Mori wasn't afraid of what
[56:58] hmon could do to him or what he was
[57:01] defying amen what he was what he was
[57:03] because he was against God you see so it
[57:07] takes it takes courage Amen to stand
[57:09] firm on what you believe if somebody
[57:12] asks you what do you believe why do you
[57:14] believe it amen have courage to tell
[57:16] them why if you know why right but then
[57:19] also have courage to tell them if you
[57:21] don't know then I don't know but I could
[57:23] take you to someone that can that can
[57:25] that might know tell them that amen give
[57:29] him my phone number brother Wade would
[57:31] love to have his phone number passed out
[57:33] you know same thing with brother
[57:35] [Laughter]
[57:37] Bob because you know what there's
[57:40] there's people that that really want to
[57:42] know and and if you don't know if you
[57:45] don't feel like comfortable about about
[57:47] about explaining your faith to people
[57:50] well you first of all you have to work
[57:52] on
[57:53] that you need to know what you believe
[57:56] all right I encourage each one of us not
[57:59] just our young people each one of you to
[58:01] know what you stand for but then if you
[58:04] don't really know then say okay I know
[58:06] someone that can help you here here's
[58:09] their phone number and if they really
[58:10] interested they'll call right and we
[58:12] will do whatever we can to help you see
[58:16] sometimes you know we get busy in things
[58:18] and and and we just try to do what we
[58:20] can you see but we if somebody wants to
[58:23] know about the Lord amen that's that's
[58:25] missionary work within within America
[58:28] amen praise God amen amen you're you're
[58:31] not I I if if you're more concerned
[58:34] about what others think than than about
[58:36] what God thinks then you're going to
[58:39] lack courage y that's right you're going
[58:41] to lack courage and you're going to be
[58:42] wishy-washy right you're going to be
[58:44] wishy-washy in what in what you're
[58:46] standing for and some and imagine if if
[58:49] Joshua was
[58:51] wishy-washy they would have never
[58:53] crossed over to that to that Promised
[58:55] Land right right amen but Joshua had to
[58:57] know that he know that he knew that God
[58:59] was with him amen amen then he was able
[59:03] to he was able to forge ah head
[59:05] amen now there the question too are
[59:07] there consequences with having courage
[59:11] and the answer is
[59:13] yes there's good consequences but there
[59:16] sometimes there's bad consequences as
[59:18] well amen we could take for example in
[59:20] Daniel Amen the three Hebrew the three
[59:23] Hebrew children that were delivered
[59:26] right they had courage to stand against
[59:28] the proclamation of the king who said if
[59:30] you don't bow down to my image amen then
[59:33] you're going to be sent into a into a
[59:36] burning oven that's that's burning seven
[59:39] times
[59:40] harder but they defied that Proclamation
[59:42] said we're not we're not bowing down to
[59:44] you we only bow down to
[59:46] God and God stood for that courage God
[59:50] stood for them for standing amen for him
[59:53] amen so don't be afraid to stand stand
[59:54] for him because he'll stand for you at
[59:56] the at the day of judgment amen he'll
[59:58] stand for you when you stand for him
[1:00:01] he's already stood for you that's
[1:00:03] righten he was hanging naked on a cross
[1:00:06] spit upon uh beard half all yanked out
[1:00:10] blood dripping down he looked like
[1:00:11] hamburger meat stood stand on the cross
[1:00:14] for you and he wasn't the way the
[1:00:17] Catholics portray him on the cross he
[1:00:19] didn't have a clout over him he was
[1:00:21] fully
[1:00:22] naked what a shameful thing
[1:00:25] that our Lord the god of Heaven creator
[1:00:28] of Heaven and Earth amen stood that for
[1:00:30] you and you can't stand for him Amen in
[1:00:34] front of this world out
[1:00:36] here amen you're afraid and and and and
[1:00:39] and you put other things ahead of God
[1:00:41] because you think those things are more
[1:00:43] important whatever it is boys or or or
[1:00:46] or or things in in your life amen God is
[1:00:49] more important amen football whatever it
[1:00:52] is amen that's not going to save you in
[1:00:55] the long run that's right amen but
[1:00:57] standing for God's word will amen
[1:01:00] standing for his word will amen it's it
[1:01:03] worked for the three Hebrew children
[1:01:05] it'll work for you in this day and hour
[1:01:07] that we're living in amen but you now
[1:01:10] Jesus he stood for what's
[1:01:13] right but it caused him his death he had
[1:01:16] courage to do so but it caused him his
[1:01:18] death amen the disciples they stood for
[1:01:21] what was right and you can see each one
[1:01:23] of them got got heads chopped off and
[1:01:27] and and they got they got martyred for
[1:01:29] standing for the
[1:01:31] word amen but were they losers in the
[1:01:34] end they were not losers in the End Amen
[1:01:38] praise God the Christian Martyrs that we
[1:01:40] read about in the fox's book of Martyrs
[1:01:42] amen they stood it for what's right they
[1:01:45] had courage to stand amen when there was
[1:01:47] Lions there were there were there was uh
[1:01:50] loosed upon them in their Arena and
[1:01:52] people were watching and them and
[1:01:53] laughing and making SP making sport of
[1:01:56] them and they're sitting there with
[1:01:58] their children you've seen the pictures
[1:02:01] with their children and just hugging
[1:02:02] them and just and just just looking up
[1:02:04] to God and say Lord you can you if you
[1:02:08] can you can watch you can uh Deliver Us
[1:02:12] from this but if you don't I'm not going
[1:02:14] to
[1:02:14] Bow I'm not going to bow to that Co the
[1:02:17] Catholic
[1:02:18] proclamations amen amen do we have that
[1:02:21] boldness in this hour amen do we have
[1:02:24] that courage amen but that courage comes
[1:02:26] from the word right amen standing up for
[1:02:29] what's right can get you in trouble with
[1:02:32] with corrupt
[1:02:33] people it can get you in trouble with
[1:02:35] the
[1:02:37] government it can get you in trouble on
[1:02:39] YouTube yeah if you have a YouTube
[1:02:42] channel it can get you in trouble with
[1:02:44] with with on social media it can get you

[1:02:48] trouble amen standing up for what's
[1:02:49] right amen but I I'd rather amen get in
[1:02:53] trouble amen with man for standing up
[1:02:55] what's right than be in trouble with God
[1:02:57] in the L at the end time amen I'd rather
[1:03:01] that 10 times hundred times over because
[1:03:05] the Bible says Jesus said don't be
[1:03:06] afraid of man that can destroy just the
[1:03:08] body but be AF but fear God that can
[1:03:11] destroy the body and the
[1:03:13] soulen and the soul is what's supposed
[1:03:16] to live eternally amen amen and so when
[1:03:20] you stand for God he stands for you amen
[1:03:23] amen praise the Lord Joshua 1 n again

[1:03:54] age amen where that wher soever thou
[1:03:58] goest amen God is with you because he
[1:04:00] promised that he would amen he said he
[1:04:03] will never leave us nor forsake us he
[1:04:06] didn't give us the the the trials that
[1:04:07] we were going to be in he didn't he

[1:04:12] this is what's going to happen to you no
[1:04:13] he just said I'll be with you that's all
[1:04:16] he said and so that's all that matters
[1:04:19] to me that's all that counts amen

[1:04:23] absolutely and that settles it amen you

[1:04:56] Miracles we want to hear about miracles
[1:04:58] we got some miracles to amen praise the
[1:05:01] Lord and it was it was God God did amen
[1:05:04] and actually it was things that even the
[1:05:06] Lord has been doing in the last two
[1:05:08] years that we didn't even even know
[1:05:09] about so we'll we'll we'll we'll explain
[1:05:12] that here in just a moment but uh
[1:05:16] um but yall can see
[1:05:23] this
[1:05:28] okay we'll just do the best here that we
[1:05:30] can
[1:05:32] um this is uh in in and I'm not going to
[1:05:36] give everything the brother brother Aon
[1:05:38] did a great job on Sunday and explaining
[1:05:41] what we did when I was with him and uh
[1:05:45] and I appreciate his his accolades
[1:05:47] because I wasn't expecting none of that
[1:05:49] but I appreciate that brother Aaron if
[1:05:51] you're listening um it's it's just the
[1:05:54] Lord you know the Lord's the one that's
[1:05:56] on on time and I I give him the glory
[1:05:59] you see but but if it blessed him then
[1:06:03] I'm I'm thankful that my brother was
[1:06:04] blessed and it was really it was a
[1:06:06] privilege to work with brother Aaron as
[1:06:08] well amen um he's not a
[1:06:12] complainer and I could take him to
[1:06:14] Honduras again any time he won't he'll
[1:06:17] eat what's been front of him at least
[1:06:18] he'll try he'll try it and uh and if he
[1:06:22] if he doesn't like it he'll at least eat
[1:06:24] a little portion of it and say brother
[1:06:26] you don't want to no it's fine
[1:06:28] I okay well I give you props because you
[1:06:31] tried some people don't even try what's
[1:06:34] giv given them and they realize they
[1:06:36] don't realize what's what's that that
[1:06:38] it's good they don't even want to try it
[1:06:42] but I give him the props to do so
[1:06:43] brother Bob did the same thing as well
[1:06:45] in Nicaragua so so that's good that's
[1:06:49] good I was always told is I'm not going
[1:06:51] to say something's bad if I've never
[1:06:53] tried it right there you go I don't care
[1:06:55] what it looks like I can't say that you
[1:06:57] can't you really can't you have to try
[1:07:00] it then you realize man that's better
[1:07:02] than the cheeseburgers I eat here in
[1:07:05] America all right anyways this is um so
[1:07:09] when when we in altoo the mountain range
[1:07:12] where we were at where we were about
[1:07:14] over 5,000 ft in
[1:07:16] elevation um um and the church that we
[1:07:19] were visiting at over there um we had to
[1:07:23] walk you Drive about 10 minutes to a
[1:07:25] specific point and then from there you
[1:07:28] there's no way to get into the church
[1:07:30] and you have to walk about 15 minutes to
[1:07:34] and you're like on the edge of the
[1:07:35] mountain walking walking uh the the
[1:07:40] the throughout throughout the uh to get
[1:07:43] to church so here we are and there's
[1:07:46] Michael right there we're carrying
[1:07:48] equipment uh for for their for for the
[1:07:51] sound um and so there's some some
[1:07:54] there's some uh little treacherous areas
[1:07:57] but that's how they get to
[1:07:59] church and I was I was surprised because
[1:08:02] older ladies are walking this road this
[1:08:04] route uh older older man and and and uh
[1:08:08] and and that that's how they get to
[1:08:10] church now the reason why I'm showing
[1:08:11] this is because when we got
[1:08:14] there this was a sister that was there
[1:08:16] at the church how old is she
[1:08:20] sweetheart 76
[1:08:22] sister nicolasa is her
[1:08:26] name the the night
[1:08:29] before I had I had preached at at her
[1:08:32] house we had a uh we had a uh a service
[1:08:35] at her house and I had ministered in her
[1:08:38] house and um I did not know I preached a
[1:08:42] faith building message to them but I did
[1:08:45] not know that she had two years prior
[1:08:48] she had she had a problem with her hip
[1:08:52] and uh and her leg leg of it it broke
[1:08:57] her hip had broken but then in that
[1:08:59] transition of her hip had being broken
[1:09:01] she also had gotten a uh it was an ulcer
[1:09:05] down on the same
[1:09:08] leg and so um she was battling with that
[1:09:11] but then one day when when she got
[1:09:13] diagnosed with that at the doctor's
[1:09:15] office this is the testimony she was
[1:09:17] telling me um she said that um the
[1:09:20] doctor said that you're going to you
[1:09:22] have this and she told the doctor she
[1:09:23] said I I refuse to have that I refuse it
[1:09:27] and so she went home and she just have
[1:09:30] faith in God trusting in God well uh
[1:09:32] sometime later she went back to the
[1:09:34] doctor and the doctor told her she was
[1:09:37] much better like you know she had gotten
[1:09:39] much better everything was healing up
[1:09:42] faster than than what the doctor was
[1:09:44] expecting it for the doctor wasn't even
[1:09:46] giving her hopes about that leg he told
[1:09:48] her that you're not going to be able to
[1:09:50] walk you're not going to be able to walk
[1:09:52] at all on that leg anymore so you're
[1:09:54] just going to have to use either
[1:09:56] crutches or be pushed on a wheelchair
[1:09:58] but she refused that and so the doctor
[1:10:01] the doctor was so impressed with her
[1:10:03] with her uh with what she um she had
[1:10:07] um you know how how good she had gotten
[1:10:11] that the doctor said well well I don't
[1:10:12] know what had happened but if it's
[1:10:14] something that has to do with the Lord
[1:10:16] why don't you pray for
[1:10:19] me I need for you to pray for me and so
[1:10:22] she the doctor asked her to pray for him
[1:10:25] and I thought that that was incredible
[1:10:27] well two years had passed that she could
[1:10:31] not have she could not walk that that
[1:10:34] path to go to church uh 15 minutes but
[1:10:38] when we got there that morning she was
[1:10:40] the first one there that was the first
[1:10:43] time that she had gone to church in two
[1:10:46] years
[1:10:48] hey and she went by herself there was a
[1:10:51] little boy there was I think it was one
[1:10:52] of her nephews that was that helped her
[1:10:55] I think he was like 10 11 years old
[1:10:57] maybe he was there with her but she
[1:11:00] walked she was the first one there we
[1:11:03] weren't expecting for her to be there
[1:11:04] even her her her her her um her grandson
[1:11:07] which is brother hoel right here right
[1:11:10] here was didn't even know that she was
[1:11:12] going to be there and but it surprised
[1:11:14] all of them because that was the first
[1:11:16] time in two years that she had gone to
[1:11:18] church so I believe whatever whatever
[1:11:21] God did that that that just said you
[1:11:23] know what whatever this brother preached
[1:11:24] in my house I'm going to church the next
[1:11:27] day and so I just thank God for
[1:11:31] that so y'all remember Sister nicolasa
[1:11:34] in prayer she's very a precious sister
[1:11:37] and and uh really encourag that's not
[1:11:40] that day after we
[1:11:42] uh after we uh we uh preached there at
[1:11:45] the church um this young brother came up
[1:11:48] to us and uh he said that he was having
[1:11:51] trouble with his eyesight and he was
[1:11:53] only he's only about 14 years old and uh
[1:11:57] we thought we thought maybe uh you know
[1:12:00] it was just that he needs glasses or
[1:12:03] something like that but um apparently
[1:12:05] this young man around when he was 2
[1:12:07] years old he almost died um and uh he
[1:12:12] had he had he had a lot of uh seizures
[1:12:15] and there was a point where where the
[1:12:17] parents almost lost him but the Lord
[1:12:19] took him took him out of that and uh but
[1:12:22] he's been having problems with his
[1:12:23] Vision so we prayed for the brother the
[1:12:25] Young Brother well they they they we we
[1:12:28] gave him prayer cloths as well they told
[1:12:31] us a couple of days later that he was
[1:12:33] there U his dad had a had a little
[1:12:36] splint splinter in his hand and so uh he
[1:12:40] was there trying to help his dad take
[1:12:42] the splinter out of his hand and so his
[1:12:45] dad couldn't even see the Splinter but
[1:12:48] the boy was looking at the Splinter and
[1:12:51] he said Dad I see it right there
[1:12:54] and he said that they could he couldn't
[1:12:56] see that that he wasn't capable of even
[1:12:59] seeing anything like that his dad
[1:13:01] couldn't see the Splinter but he could
[1:13:02] see it he helped him take it out so I
[1:13:05] believe God's doing something in that
[1:13:06] young boy's Vision y' yall just remember
[1:13:09] continue to remember him in prayer amen
[1:13:11] that God that God would U just fully
[1:13:14] restore his vision we know that God can
[1:13:17] now these are some of the some of the uh
[1:13:20] food that that that we used at the Youth
[1:13:22] Camp
[1:13:23] uh these are bags of beans and uh that
[1:13:28] some of you all helped uh uh pay for
[1:13:32] this is one of our brothers the brothers
[1:13:34] that we work with there Minister brother
[1:13:36] uh this is his son uh this is some of
[1:13:39] the beans so what they did is some some
[1:13:42] of the brothers from another part of
[1:13:44] region of Honduras they took care of the
[1:13:46] be the beans another Brothers took care
[1:13:48] of the beef another they all just

[1:13:53] the the youth camp and so um there's
[1:13:57] some of the sisters uh this is Brother
[1:13:59] Eric's mom uh sister Nidia and she's
[1:14:03] there helping prepare some of that meat
[1:14:05] in her kitchen there's some of the meat
[1:14:08] right there that's pork uh
[1:14:13] beef I
[1:14:15] don't oh yes flour and and other and
[1:14:18] some toilet paper there at the top that
[1:14:21] was going to be used there's there's
[1:14:22] some of that right
[1:14:25] there what is this
[1:14:28] sweetheart okay this part of the meat
[1:14:32] okay I got to have my help
[1:14:36] meat to help me with this meat
[1:14:41] here amen this is some of the toilet
[1:14:44] paper and and some of the things that
[1:14:45] were going to be used there at the camp
[1:14:48] this is flour right amen
[1:14:51] see uh and rice
[1:14:55] and there's there it is at the camp and
[1:14:58] there's some of it being
[1:15:01] cooked
[1:15:04] um and there here some of the sisters uh
[1:15:12] cooking uh this is Brother
[1:15:17] Eric he's carrying some bananas or
[1:15:20] plantains
[1:15:22] yeah
[1:15:24] we we we had a little joke with him
[1:15:26] because we were calling him
[1:15:28] Arthur Arthur the little cartoon
[1:15:31] [Laughter]
[1:15:33] character the sweater that that was a a
[1:15:37] joke we had going on with them actually
[1:15:39] Zoe came up with
[1:15:41] that this is a sister uh she's using a
[1:15:45] um I believe they had a little generator
[1:15:47] out there and so she needed to blend
[1:15:50] something on the blender so that's what
[1:15:52] she's doing right there
[1:15:55] um and then here's I think this is a
[1:15:59] video
[1:16:01] um and get an idea of of them serving uh
[1:16:05] some of the plates that they would
[1:16:08] serve yes
[1:16:10] manyal how many meals sweetheart were
[1:16:14] served oh three times a day there was
[1:16:16] three meals Ser three times a day there
[1:16:18] was a 207 about 275 280 campers that
[1:16:22] went
[1:16:24] but that that's just for kids and that
[1:16:26] doesn't count the adults that were there
[1:16:28] that they ate two to three times a day
[1:16:30] as well and so there was actually more
[1:16:35] more that because we were just counting
[1:16:38] just for the kids but even adults were
[1:16:41] able to eat as well and so we just thank
[1:16:44] God you know what
[1:16:46] $3,000 goes a long way in those places
[1:16:49] you see for for four days four days of
[1:16:53] camp or three three days of
[1:16:55] camp and here's some of the here's some
[1:16:58] of the sisters already have some some of
[1:17:00] the plates served um ready uh they would
[1:17:04] just serve them as they know that that
[1:17:06] that the service is about to end they
[1:17:09] have them ready served so that the kids
[1:17:11] can just go up there and grab start
[1:17:13] grabbing
[1:17:16] plates here's some of the plates
[1:17:19] everything that they eat is always has a
[1:17:22] tortilla to go with it and
[1:17:26] uh did somebody say
[1:17:32] something yeah amen especially if
[1:17:36] they're corn
[1:17:38] tortillas yeah this is a frier right
[1:17:42] yeah and so they they use that I think
[1:17:44] this is what the brother um brother
[1:17:47] Heraldo he has a restaurant there in the
[1:17:49] city and so he brought some of his
[1:17:51] equipment from his restaurant and he
[1:17:53] goes to brother Eric's church and so he
[1:17:55] helped with with that cooking lot I'm
[1:17:57] going to tell you what brother head
[1:18:00] Ado H you talking about some chicken now
[1:18:03] there was one
[1:18:05] day there was one day where he cooked
[1:18:07] some chicken let me tell you that was
[1:18:09] some of the best chicken I've ever had I
[1:18:11] don't know how he seasoned it or what
[1:18:14] but man Popeyes KFC none of them
[1:18:17] churches ain't got nothing on what this
[1:18:18] brother's chicken was this chicken was
[1:18:20] good it was some good chicken
[1:18:23] I wish we had a picture of brother Hadad
[1:18:25] though
[1:18:28] um brother Jewel would probably want to
[1:18:30] stay in Honduras if he tried that
[1:18:32] [Laughter]
[1:18:34] chicken uh that's uh some of the food
[1:18:37] prep there uh there's some of the
[1:18:39] sisters prepping um yeah grating some
[1:18:43] cheese right right
[1:18:45] sweetheart and then there's there's some
[1:18:48] some of them cutting some vegetables now
[1:18:50] while we were
[1:18:51] there Christine before we left we bought
[1:18:54] some some equipment on on Amazon to to
[1:18:58] help them uh cut things faster and so
[1:19:02] when we got there and we showed them
[1:19:04] that the sisters were they were about to
[1:19:06] dance for before the
[1:19:09] Lord when they saw that that there was
[1:19:12] like chopping onions and tomatoes so
[1:19:15] fast so uh we ended up getting another
[1:19:18] one uh or another sister s brother
[1:19:21] Eric's mom had something similar like
[1:19:23] that already and they took that there to
[1:19:25] also help speed things up we also got
[1:19:29] them while we were there some some
[1:19:31] juicers to help juice because they would
[1:19:33] make lemonade for the for the kids and
[1:19:36] they would send their hand squeezing all
[1:19:37] the lemons in this big old in this big
[1:19:39] old I don't know how many gallons bucket
[1:19:43] and but so we got them some of that with
[1:19:45] that money as well some of the funds
[1:19:47] that you all had given as well and it
[1:19:49] helped them uh there's brother H Ido
[1:19:52] right there the brother that that has
[1:19:53] the restaurant he probably there cooking
[1:19:56] that chicken right
[1:19:59] there all right now I wanted to show
[1:20:02] show you all this picture that we had
[1:20:05] there was two or three days where we had
[1:20:06] to rent a
[1:20:08] vehicle and uh renting a vehicle over
[1:20:11] there isn't like renting a vehicle here
[1:20:13] you know when normally when you rent a
[1:20:15] vehicle here you get either the previous
[1:20:17] year model of something or maybe the
[1:20:19] latest year model not there you get
[1:20:21] about 15 years uh earlier you're going
[1:20:24] to drive a 2008 to
[1:20:26] 2010 and you're going to drive it with
[1:20:29] with with all the lights on the
[1:20:33] dashboard all lit up but as long as as
[1:20:37] long as it runs that's a rented vehicle
[1:20:40] that's a rented vehicle as long as it
[1:20:42] runs as long as it breaks so uh we had
[1:20:47] to do that about two or three times and
[1:20:48] it was I think it was a 2010 for escape
[1:20:52] that we were riding
[1:20:53] but uh that's just normal for them you
[1:20:56] know that's that's their I think this is
[1:20:59] another video
[1:21:00] here this is Christine help him wash
[1:21:03] dishes yeah as they were as they were um
[1:21:06] sometimes they would run out of dishes
[1:21:07] to serve the the the the the the the
[1:21:09] kids so the sisters they they had to
[1:21:12] have a specific station to wash dishes
[1:21:15] constantly and So Christine was there
[1:21:17] helping with that and there here some of
[1:21:20] the drinks being served with more
[1:21:24] meals and um all right so that is that
[1:21:30] now let me I'll tell tell you tell you
[1:21:33] these things the those brothers and
[1:21:35] those sisters down there they really
[1:21:38] really believe in the power of prayer
[1:21:40] cloths right they believe that so when
[1:21:43] we take them prayer cloths they really
[1:21:45] believe that and two years ago when we
[1:21:49] had went to Honduras and I had
[1:21:50] ministered in a specific place called
[1:21:52] San Loreno which we were at this time
[1:21:54] again this year Under the Tent that's
[1:21:57] where they had the ministers meetings um
[1:22:00] the brother there who's in charge of the
[1:22:02] church because their Pastor is sick
[1:22:04] right now and and and everything and uh
[1:22:07] brother hoel told me he said brother
[1:22:09] Luis do you remember when we when you
[1:22:11] gave prayer Clause here two years ago he
[1:22:13] said he said I want to tell you what
[1:22:15] happened and so he gave me a one of the
[1:22:18] testimonies it was a sister a young
[1:22:20] sister a single mom who had gotten a
[1:22:23] prayer CLA she had I don't know what she
[1:22:25] had but she was unable to move uh like
[1:22:28] she couldn't get up and walk properly um
[1:22:31] she was having trouble with mobility and
[1:22:34] she had to take care of her little child
[1:22:36] so she was having trouble even holding
[1:22:38] him and things like that well they went
[1:22:40] to pray for her at the church and they
[1:22:42] told her and they gave her a prayer
[1:22:44] cloth um and that sister recovered
[1:22:47] completely after
[1:22:49] that she's she was able to help raise
[1:22:51] her her her little kid and and um he
[1:22:55] said that she recovered miraculously and
[1:22:57] she's moving around now am like normal
[1:22:59] so we just thank God for that amen and
[1:23:03] when I give them prayer CLA I
[1:23:04] specifically tell them it's what we tell
[1:23:06] them what we tell you all here you know
[1:23:08] the power is not in the prayer cloth
[1:23:09] amen it's first of all it's scriptural
[1:23:13] they took in the book of Acts from from
[1:23:16] Paul his his his his his cloths and and
[1:23:20] his and his uh handkerchiefs that he had
[1:23:23] that he would wipe his sweat off because
[1:23:25] he could he couldn't stop and pray for
[1:23:27] everybody so people with so much Faith
[1:23:29] would just grab and just grab whatever
[1:23:31] they could from him and they would
[1:23:34] receive the Bible says that they
[1:23:35] received healing and demons were cast
[1:23:37] out of people all right so Paul didn't
[1:23:40] do that amen neither did the prayer
[1:23:42] cloth it was the faith of the people
[1:23:45] that God was in that man you see and
[1:23:48] that if God was was could could heal
[1:23:50] someone by by him laying hands upon the
[1:23:53] people then I believe that even even his
[1:23:56] prayer cloth amen or was able to to to
[1:23:59] do the miracle for me it's and it was
[1:24:01] faith in in God and so and so many of
[1:24:06] the prayer cloths many of them that we
[1:24:08] took we this time around we took a
[1:24:10] Ziploc bag full of them all of them are
[1:24:12] gone all of them are gone and um when we
[1:24:16] were there in altoo where we were where
[1:24:18] we were uh uh walking the 15minute route
[1:24:22] there on to the church there the night
[1:24:24] before when I had preached at the sis uh
[1:24:26] at the sister's house there was a a
[1:24:29] Pentecostal Pastor that was there and
[1:24:32] and he had taken some of his
[1:24:33] congregation to the uh to to to to the
[1:24:36] service well we gave him prayer cloths
[1:24:39] as well he said he said that a couple of
[1:24:41] days later his wife started having a
[1:24:44] pain on her
[1:24:45] side uh one of the nights and it was
[1:24:48] really really bad that it was actually
[1:24:50] he was being he was worried about about
[1:24:52] it and they thought that they had to
[1:24:54] take her to the hospital he did not know
[1:24:55] what it was he remembered that he had
[1:24:57] gotten the prayer cloth and so he took
[1:25:00] the prayer cloth he said in the name of
[1:25:01] the Lord Jesus Christ put it on the
[1:25:03] sister on on his wife she just went to
[1:25:06] sleep and the day after that pain was
[1:25:08] completely gone was completely gone and
[1:25:13] so maybe that will that will help him
[1:25:16] you know to to uh draw you know maybe
[1:25:19] even know more about this message you
[1:25:21] see they God still God still heals and
[1:25:25] and so and then
[1:25:27] um
[1:25:30] um the last the last one that I thought
[1:25:32] and then with this we'll we'll finish
[1:25:34] but the brother there in San Loreno the
[1:25:36] one that told me about the sister that
[1:25:38] was could not move he said that um there
[1:25:41] was a 18-year-old boy who had to have
[1:25:45] dialysis so his kidneys were were
[1:25:48] shutting down was really really bad 18
[1:25:50] years old imagine that
[1:25:53] and um he asked for prayer and they went
[1:25:56] to pray for him and they and and so
[1:25:59] brother hoel gave him a prayer cloth one
[1:26:01] of the prayer cloths that we had given
[1:26:03] him there two years before he said that
[1:26:07] the boy this is what he tells me now you
[1:26:09] know that's that's what he told me he
[1:26:11] said the boy would put it on his side on
[1:26:14] on his on his and he said that that
[1:26:16] prayer cloth would just stick to
[1:26:19] him and I don't know how that happened
[1:26:21] but God God's the one who does it he
[1:26:23] said that that thing would he it was
[1:26:26] hard for him to remove that prayer cloth
[1:26:28] so what he told he told that to brother
[1:26:30] hoel and so brother hoel said just leave
[1:26:33] it on there said God is doing something
[1:26:36] leave it on there so he left it on there
[1:26:39] slept with it everything and he went to
[1:26:43] have the the the the appointment to
[1:26:45] start the dialysis but when he got to
[1:26:48] the appointment and start the dialysis
[1:26:50] the doctors couldn't even start cuz they
[1:26:53] said young man something is going on
[1:26:55] here your kidneys look
[1:26:58] fine I don't know if we made a
[1:27:01] mistake or what I don't know what's
[1:27:04] going on but the boy didn't end up
[1:27:05] having to have dialysis I believe God
[1:27:07] gave him you
[1:27:08] kidneys that's what I believe and uh and
[1:27:12] and he to this day this boy is fine and
[1:27:15] they're at the church and uh so um
[1:27:20] that's uh God still got
[1:27:23] amen and uh and he said the boy he says
[1:27:25] afterwards after the the Lord healed him
[1:27:28] he said now that prayer cloth wouldn't
[1:27:30] stick to him
[1:27:31] anymore he said the prayer cloth
[1:27:33] wouldn't stick to him anymore so brother
[1:27:34] hoel told him he said just keep the
[1:27:36] prayer cloth for other other times you
[1:27:39] see you might need it again so so he he
[1:27:43] from as far as I know he still has the
[1:27:45] pray CL those were things that were that
[1:27:47] were per Claus given out two years
[1:27:49] before right and I didn't know anything
[1:27:52] about these things until this this trip
[1:27:55] so who knows Lord we might be expecting
[1:27:58] new Miracles and stuff you know on our
[1:28:01] next trip from from these prayer clocks
[1:28:03] that we gave out because we gave a lot
[1:28:06] so God still God Amen and if he can do
[1:28:10] it for them he can do it for you amen
[1:28:13] and so God he's still in the healing
[1:28:15] business you love the Lord am amen let's
[1:28:18] send to our feet this we're going to
[1:28:20] have the musicians come and let's just
[1:28:22] sing something
