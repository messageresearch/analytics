========================================

good to be in the house of the Lord we're on uh I I know I took a step back and some of the scriptures we were almost to Hebrews 12 and I I I backtracked to just to kind of cover Perfection a little bit more and uh so we'll start reading from verse 39 and 40 this morning Lord come on in [Applause] Sister amen well that's a nice surprise this morning let's just go to the Lord in prayer before we read our scripture Lord we're so grateful this morning to you for all your many blessings and and Lord we just ask your blessing as we study these things out this morning Lord certainly we lord we relying on you for Spiritual Perfection Lord and to bring us to a place Lord where we can have confidence in your word and I pray God that you'll just bless brother Wade as he's preparing and studying Lord bless our our ears to hear Lord we ask in your name so in verse 39 it says and these all having obtained a good report through faith receive not the promise all the ones that um uh it that that was very timely yesterday that that sermon that brother Luke was preaching he's he's basically preaching what we've been studying on it I I was telling brother Wade yesterday pretty much everything he said was actually in my in my slides and so forth uh many many of the main points that he covered so that's it's it's just amazing to see the spirit move and just line everything up just like that but we've been talking about the the cloud of witnesses in Hebrews 11 that U that Paul mentions in Hebrews 12 the cloud of witnesses that we've got all these examples of our of of people that instead of looking at the circumstances they just looked straight at Christ but yet they never attained the promise that was promised to us the promise of the Holy Ghost filled life and uh in Hebrews 12 you know Paul would go on to say we we've come to those thing we've come to the to what they were just looking at and in verse 40 it says God having provided some better thing for us that they without us should not be made perfect and so just kind of meditate on that what is perfection and to think this morning that they're they're waiting on us that they're relying on us that they need us to come to a place of perfection and you know it where you how you going to get perfect it's not by like brother Luke was even preaching last night where you we can't put Works before faith we put faiths before works because it's not our works that brings Perfection but it's our faith in him the finished work in Jesus Christ that brings Perfection it's ch it's all about Christ it's not what I am brother BR would say in the unconditional Covenant that God made with the people it's not what I am who I am it's the Perfection of Jesus Christ and God that died in my place to make me what I am it isn't whether I can stand I can't it's whether he stood in my place and he said that would make a Baptist shout there's something about it that's real why is it something that is real because it's Christ that's doing the work it's Christ that uh as we were uh the last time I spoke uh just on a topic as we were studying things out that message that inter Veil it's Christ that takes you from a place of struggle to a place of rest because when you're resting in Christ it's him doing the work not you brother R said the law having a shadow God requires perfection no one could ever come to Heaven outside of being perfect you must be perfect and yet the scripture says None is perfect so if you must be perfect to come to heaven then and the scripture says None is perfect and we've all sinned and come short of the glory of God how are we ever going to enter God's living place and Dwelling Place when he requires Perfection Jesus said I Believe In The Sermon on the Mount he said be therefore perfect even as your father in Heaven is perfect think of the Perfection that God requires of the Perfection of the person a Perfection and that's what Hebrews 11:40 says that they without us should not be made perfect Hebrews 10 said for the law having a shadow of good things to come and not the very image of the things can never with those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually make the comers there un to perfect so those Believers in that great cloud of witness Witnesses in Hebrews 11 they could never come to this Perfection the law can never bring you to a perfect what Perfection Perfection of Christ where he's not looking at you anymore he's looking at himself he's looking at what he's done in you he's looking at his life he's looking at his blood he's looking at the the Perfection per well when God looks at himself how can you find F like like Paul said how can you hold anything to the charge of God's elect if God has filled your heart with the Holy Ghost and God is residing there how can you how can you hold anything to the charge of somebody that's been made perfect for then would they not have ceased to be offered because that the worshippers once per should have no more conscience of sins that's what the Holy Ghost does it changes you changes the way that you think it changes the way you you are to make you like Christ and the message identification it said his sinless nature expressed God's word and the only way that you will ever be able to express God's word that you believe it and watch it act behind you you will have to have that sinless nature that come from God before the foundation of the world you was recognized with him before the word can ever express itself through you it takes a sin nature to do that what kind of what kind of nature the nature of Christ that God can give you his nature so that you you become from somebody that wants to fight and stew and and rail to a Meek little lamb nature and what in the message identification he said that don't mean perfection in yourself you can't be that but you see even our people are getting away from the practice of Holiness we begin to let down so many bars see we come to we got to come to that place of our profession he is our example and he is our sin Bearer and then if we profess that he is our Peacemaker he is our propitiation then if we profess that then that is supposed to reflect him back in us oh you see why the the word that you hear is actually accomplishing something in your life as you you're you're born by the word and that produces the Life of Christ in your soul but as you continue to eat the word it's like looking in a mirror till you become more and more and more like Christ and what is it doing it's not you it's not your Perfection it's Christ Perfection the way you look in the mirror and and and it's it's Christ per Perfection being reflected back because now where you used to act like the world you're behaving and thinking and walking like Christ it's Christ that's on this place so where is your Perfection come from Christ not from your own works not from the from the lies of the devil or the things of this world but from Christ yes the word is actually bringing you to a place of perfection yes and just some little thoughts that I just pulled some nuggets that I pulled out of different things that brother R said he said it's a perfect place calling you to that Perfection and you have to be perfect to get there and he said Perfection come by Jesus Christ and another place he said he has perfected forever those that are Sanctified or cleaned by the Holy Spirit then we are imperfection now you can see from that previous slide that Perfection is tied to Holiness cuz somebody that's uh Jesus ain't going to have nothing to do with an Unholy life you got to be Sanctified before just a little baby form sanc sanctification before God can even Tabernacle himself in in your soul because God will not dwell in an unclean vessel so Perfection is tied to Holiness and that's what this stature of a perfect man is about holy godliness and brotherly kindness and these things are a holy life and you see even that that last slide if we go back to that real quick he said people people start get they Dro in the bar away from Holiness God has called us to a holy life a separated life a life that looks different from the world he has perfected forever those that are Sanctified or cleaned by the Holy Spirit then we are imperfection God's Great Holy Spirit he said in another place moving in the hearts of the people bringing that Eve and Adam together again in their perfection God's holiness God's Perfection bringing us back together again where we're not thinking different we're not walking different we're not living a different way than Christ would live and as we get through some of the slides here what we're seeing what brother Amma is trying to express to us through the scriptures that Perfection is a Oneness where God where where where you can look at the bride and see Christ manifested again not something different but Christ actually veiled in your flesh again he said and and then you be therefore perfect even as your heavenly father is perfect how can you be when it's not my perfection it's not your Perfection it's his Perfection of his word that he chose you you never chose him and he brought you into Christ and you are secure with Christ and just as perfect as Christ was before God for you're not standing with your own you're standing in him with one thing I believe God is his Perfection of his word and Christ is the mystery of God revealed brother R would say Hebrews 11 said they cannot be perfect without us hands and feet cannot be perfect without the brains the knowledge the head and so forth see and we're all perfected in him like brother Luke was preaching last night by one Spirit we're all baptized into one body free from judgment it's his spirit it's his life it's the life that was in the blood that makes us perfect and I'll just read through some of these quotes pretty quickly Matthew 5:48 says be perfect therefore as your heavenly father is perfect in Philippians 3:12 it says not that I have already obtained this or have already arrived at my my goal but I press on to take hold of that for which Christ Jesus Took hold of me and there's Paul talking again about that race we've got a goal there's a finish line that we're racing to and what's what's the Finish Line Perfection Oneness with Christ where we oh oh you you think about how brother R would Express that sin uh the things that people do are attributes of sin and the the re and the reason why you do things misbehave is because you you disbelieve God's word but think about the effect that could happen if you just believed all of God's word it will change your life it will change the way that you are that's what's happening as you as you Feast on the word it's making you like Christ in 1 Thessalonians 5:23 may your whole Spirit now this is we talk a lot about the scripture that that Martin Luther preached on the just shall live by faith this is the the scripture that John Wesley preached on May your whole Spirit soul and body be kept blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ because what was John Wesley preaching on we'll get to it in just a moment he was preaching the stature of a perfect man that God can sanctify your spirit and make you holy make you make you live a life that's that's been purged by the word that that's been cleaned up so that your thinking is different and Hebrews chapter 6:1 said therefore let us move beyond the elementary teachings about Christ and be taken forward to maturity in 1 John 4:18 says there is no fear in love but perfect love drives out fear perfect love in Colossians 1:28 says he is the one we Proclaim admonishing and teaching everyone with all wisdom so that we pres may present everyone fully mature in Christ and Ephesians 4:13 what we all know till we all come in the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God unto a perfect man unto the measure of the stature of the of fullness of Christ and that word perfect means full grown adult of full measure a full age mature so brother Ram in one place he said it's a living seed it's a word of God it'll grow to its Perfection so when you hear when that word has been planted in your heart it will grow and grow and grow until finally you see the bark come on it you see the leaves come out you'll see the fruit it's bearing something and that's what we're we're doing now I I want to take a just quick look at some what some of these denominations believed about pedest what about uh about perfection because I think it'll it'll be helpful reformed calvinist View believes that you you just can't come to Perfection that there's you just you're you're born again and and you can't come to it so I'm just going to summarize these notes now Martin Martin Luther finished he he just centered on Christ's finished work on the cross and they don't view sanctification as a second work of Grace so he was just focused on you're just you're Justified you're you're what what was Martin Luther preaching on the Born Again experience that we're not born again you're not justified by faith in what the Roman Catholic Church teaches or by by uh confessing your sins to a priest or uh things like that but he was preaching a new birth the right way to be born again rather than seeking to Achieve Personal Perfection lutherans rely on Christ's perfect righteousness and Purity to Believers through faith now John Wesley took it up a second stage he taught the doctrine of Christian Perfection also known as entire sanctification and this view emphasizes a second work of Grace in other words after you're born again there's more to it there's more to it that that that God can clean up your life and and and change things I'm I'm not talking about cleaning up like dirty living I'm talking about cleaning up the way you think so that you can love your brother so that this these things so that you can live a a clean holy life what what's Perfection again we're talking about we're talking about AO holy living holy living toward one another where you can forgive one another and really love one another this view emphasizes a second work of Grace after conversion where Believers can attain a state of perfect love and Purity enabling them to live a life free from willful sin now let's see what brother Ram talk about this he said who is this and who is this me mkis DEC he said now we see here plainly the complete secret of our lives in Journey and death and where we go after we die also predestination is in plain view here now listen as we teach this closely the stages of the Eternal purpose he had in his secret has now been revealed there is th still three stages to Perfection just like he redeems the world same way he redeems his church and and the reason let's not lose focus of what we're talking about we're talking about that they the Hebrews 11 folks are waiting on us and so it's prudent for us to understand these things because we've got to come to Perfection they are waiting on us to come to Perfection there are still three stages to Perfection just like he redeems the world same way he redeems his church he redeems the people in three stages first is justification like Luther priest now it's helpful to us for us to understand what Luther was preaching when he preached justification he wasn't just preaching about a baby form justification Luther was born again he was born again he was preaching the right way to be born again second sanctification like Wesley preached third baptism of the Holy Ghost then comes the Rapture and the third Exodus brother Brown would say God always goes in threes he's perfect in threes you all notice my preaching it's always Threes And Sevens threes is his Perfection first second and third pull and know all everything see justification sanctification the baptism of the Holy Ghost now we've got three stages here now brother BR when he preached um uh future home the future home message I've got kind of an outline of the three stages as we're just studying these things out um so that we can try to be plain and the and the and the first quote I've got here he said now the first step of justification is repentance toward God and he he goes on to explain you got your sins have been chopped off what you did that your past has been chopped off but you keep going up you keep going higher you now the second stage you are completely Justified as though you never did it at the beginning as though you never did it at the beginning this is a quote from the invisible Union and the third you're standing completely you never sinned at the first place God don't even know it's in the sea of forgetfulness you never did it now so this first this first quote here is from the message um future home of the Heavenly bride and the second and third quotes are from the invisible Union brother R would say in God's provided place of worship he said this church will come through justification through Luther through sanctification through Wesley through the baptism of the Holy Ghost to the Pentecostal and go right on into the Perfection of the son of man that when husband and wife will be not different but the same person God will be so manifested into his bride his church till they will both be the same they are one now you see where we're at that's why we keep going back to this chart that brother brother Wade's been preaching on that I'll just touch on just for a moment and you can see those three stages of perfection and what what's bringing Perfection as you eat the word it's uniting like just looking in the mirror the mirror of God's word as Paul will say you're feasting on the word it's becoming more and more like Christ and the first stage will be your new birth that you're born again and the second stage will be God is sanctifying you as you move up the stature of perfect that's what the stature of perfect man is he's cleaning you up cleansing you until finally finally you come to adoption where you get to a place where God really the place where God really wanted you and that is what is necessary to bring the Saints from the ground he said three is perfection the ministry come to us Perfection when it reproduce Christ again in natural amongst human beings as was predicted as it was in the days of lot and another quote he said in the sea do not air with a shook he said now we understand also that God is perfected in threes God is per perfected in three grace is five seven is completion like The World God is perfected in father son Holy Ghost that's the Perfection of the godhead now there's also in paragraph 49 there's also three imperfection of the steps of Grace to the church justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost that consists of the new birth just like a natural birth is tiped by it which a woman three three steps three steps to come into Perfection with Christ and that's why Paul was saying God God having provided some better thing for us that they without us should not be made perfect and in Hebrews chapter 6 Paul said therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ let us go on unto Perfection not laying again the foundation of repentance not laying again this Foundation here at the bottom but let's keep going on to perfection in Christ and first Thessalonians it said for this we say unto you by the word of the Lord that that uh we which alive and remain and the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep for the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of the Archangel and with the Trump of God and the dead in Christ shall rise first and that ties back perfectly with what Paul is saying that we've got to be made perfect so the dead in Christ will come forth from the ground this is a promise that the Lord himself will come with a message to unite us with him so to bring the Dead from the ground that because they without us shall not be made shall not be made perfect brother Ram said in the statute of a perfect man he said you get it these people who died in here are depending and waiting on us so this church has got to come to perfection in order to bring the resurrection and they're under Souls under the altar waiting for this church to come to his Perfection that when Christ does come and this church you see is coming smaller smaller in the minority he said let's get the message to the dying that's what he's waiting on us to do now you think does this really drive a home to make it personal you think about all your loved ones many of us many of the ones sitting here have lost spouses or loved ones and and to think that they are actually waiting on you I I think that really maybe light of fire under us that if they're waiting on us and it's prudent on us to do these things that he's encour like Paul Paul Paul was so encouraging if you really read Hebrews 11 and 12 and Hebrews 12 he's telling you don't give up let's run this race with with everything that's in us because and and even brother Bram would say what are we what are we doing at church for we're here for a purpose to to to unite to to unite with Christ to to see his word made manifest in us and he he was brother R would see it in the in the sudden secret going away of the church he said oh what we need today is a calling together a getting ready and not depending on the preacher but you as an individual before God make yourself ready for the coming of the Lord no matter what they call you and what action they take that doesn't change God one bit God will do it just the same he's depending and waiting on us oh if we could be like those Saints in Hebrews 11 and not look at circumstances not look at other people that are maybe preaching wrong or doing wrong or living wrong but just keep our eyes right on Christ because there's he is the goal Christ is the goal to bring us to Perfection to one to be one with him and the message I knoweth it not he said and what are we coming here for what are we doing are we coming here playing a game are we coming here meeting as a logist Christ can't come until that church is perfectly right right he's waiting on us what's he waiting on he's waiting on a church without a spot or or wrinkle he's coming back like that story that brother Ram told of a little girl that got married to the to the to the meat company man that when he come she was already waiting for him with her wedding clothes on and that's how Christ is going to come he's going to come back for a bride that has been Sanctified and cleansed and made perfect that has gone through those three stages of perfection not not because somebody made her or coached her into it but because individually individually you got yourself ready individually if you go back and study out that message in Oneness brother Ram said God wanted to deal with us each individually and would draw us back into Oneness with himself individually we all have our own individual walk that we're doing it's up to you and I individually and he said and not one word or one iot to that will ever fail the church will be in that shape when Jesus comes now to to think about that sometimes you look around and I I I know ministers do get discouraged sometimes you look around and and see the shape that it seems like things are in but like brother Luke was preaching people leaving it doesn't seem like they have a real stake in the they they don't have a stake in the ground if they're leaving I I I was telling brother Wade I just last Sunday I preached at a church that their Pastor just a year ago left the message and we come back and I stayed overnight in Kentucky with Monica's family and they were telling me another pastor there that's 80 years old just left the message and what is it they they just they don't they don't have they're not rooted and grounded they're not they don't have a real experience in the word because if Christ comes in your heart right oh now isn't that what brother Ram taught us in the inter Veil justification you're living by your faith and that faith can Faith Can can go away you you'll lose it sanctification you you might believe for a little bit but then you'll stop believing but now when he gives you his his faith that's permanent and if he's really giving you his faith you you're not going to stop and turn around his faith is permanent and brother R said in the statute of a perfect man he said you get it these people who died in here are depending and waiting on us so this church has got to come to perfection in order to bring the resurrection and there under Souls under the altar waiting altar waiting for this church to come to his Perfection that when Christ does come oh I think that should be encouraging to us this morning as we're getting ready to close now if you just if you're if you're if you just been born again you're wondering what comes next oh there's more there's plenty more oh you can you can even discern when when you hear people preaching things oh God has called us not to just preach like a little baby form like just repentance and things there's so much more when you're born again oh it just opens up the whole world of things and that's that's why that's why one of the greatest evidences that you've been born again is do you see do you see what the message message is really about maybe if you're questioning if you're born again this morning I one of the greatest evidences that you're born again is that the spirit of truth will lead and guide you into all truth or look back in your life and see do you really see do you really see these things that seem complex and and difficult to understand or are you are you looking at like these people that are leaving the message all do you all you see is just uh whether or not brother Brandon said there were 10,000 people when he uh when the light came to him on on the when he as he was baptizing on the Ohio River and just all the little little little things that just a human is going to do is that all you see or do you see Christ because the revelation of Jesus Christ is the evidence of the new birth to you and we'll stop on that God bless you the [Applause] musicians
