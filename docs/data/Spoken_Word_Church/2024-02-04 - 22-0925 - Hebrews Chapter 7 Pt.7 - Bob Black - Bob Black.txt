strengthen them and help them Lord and we just we just ask this blessing upon these knees in your name amen you can be seated sure appreciate the brothers and sisters in the back for getting uh all this in working order I think I think it helps to have it on the screen a little bit so so we made it uh we we made it through Hebrews chapter 7 and we're on Hebrews chapter 8 which just kind of continues that same thought but we want to kind of Jump Ahead like what like we've been doing to kind of set the theme of what we're talking talking about that that the that where Paul says the law having a shadow of good things to come the law that Old Testament law all those things that you see you read about in the Old Testament where shadow of the coming of eternal life that God put could put his life into the heart of the believer and not the very image of the things can ever with those sacrifices which they offered yearby year continually make the comers there unto perfect but now we've got something that can make us perfect that can change our life change our way of thinking change everything about us so just to kind of summarize some of those things that we talked about last time that the shadow many things that were shadowed in the Old Testament Jonah in the Jonah in the belly of the whale the bronze serpent the Mana that fell in the wilderness the rock that the Israelites drank from the Tabernacle in the wilderness all all these things were a shadow of Christ coming and dying for us that a shadow of Jesus Christ the the first Adam compared to the second Adam the Passover Lamb the Cities of Refuge the temple veil torn compared to Jesus's body Isaac the promised son and on and on I mean you could list out uh probably take take a whole day to just list out all the the types and shadows in the Old Testament that were that were speaking of the coming of Christ so it's a shadow of good things to come the law the law shows what God demanded and Calvary shows what God provided to meet that demand so you know we kind of set set and you're thinking last time we were speaking of what what if you could just take all of those take those Ten Commandments that Moses brought down from the from the uh from the mountain and and if you could put those into the believer's heart so now it wasn't something that you can read off a page and and say well I got to do this and I got to do that but put it into a believer's heart where it could just be lived um if you know the the Torah is is a the Jews call it the Torah it's a list of all the 613 Comm Commandments if you go reading those I I got to reading those the other day and it's um it's really good to just kind of meditate on all of the things that God wants us to do about how to conduct ourselves with one another and how to make good judgments and be uh make good uh decisions about uh you know when something somebody comes to court what's right and wrong and you you put all of that put all of those things into a believer's heart so that it just becomes natural that you treat one another right and so that's that's what I'm going to maybe we'll we'll take a brief uh aide go on a rabbit Trail this morning and kind of look at what how the law is fulfilled in you so in Hebrews chapter 8 Paul begins to speak about he said now the things we have spoken this is the son now he's going to sum sum everything up we've got an high priest who is set on the right hand of the throne in the ma of the Majesty in the heavens a minister of the sanctuary and of the true Tabernacle which the Lord pitched and not man so what's he what's he setting in our mind mind he's said in the Old Testament you could see that Tabernacle that you could walk through that only the high priest could go into the holy of holies and all the different Furnitures and things that went into it but that was a shadow of something that's real so now we've got access to the real what what is the real that God could come and dwell in the heart of the believer in Hebrews 9 chapter 9 he said for Christ has not entered into the holy places made with hands so we're not talking about something that just you can touch anymore but now God has entered into the of the believer which are the figures of the true but into heaven itself now to appear in the presence of God for us and doesn't doesn't the bible say that you're seated in Heavenly places with Christ if you're filled with the Holy Ghost you're seated in Heavenly places because now you're United with that eternal life so in Exodus chapter 25 it says and the tongue and the tongues are speaking of the how the temple was made cuz Paul's he's is about to start talking about the pattern in the mountain he said and the tongues thereof and the snuff dishes thereof shall be of pure gold of a Talon of pure gold shall he make it with all these vessels and look that thou uh God's instructions to Moses look that thou make them after their pattern which will show thee in the mount what's the pattern that God doesn't want to just dwell in in a a building made with hands or a building Made of Stone but God wants to dwell in your heart he wants to dwell in you so in Hebrews 8:3 says for every high priest is ordained to offer gifts and sacrifices whereof it is of necessity that this man have somewhat also to offer for if he were on Earth he should not be a priest seeing that there are priests that offer gifts according to the law who serve unto the example and Shadow of heavenly things as Moses was admonished of God when he was about to make the Tabernacle for see saith he that thou make all things according to the pattern showed to thee in the mount so he's he's comparing the the natural things that the Old Testament priests did where they would they would kill animals and and they would offer gifts for the people but now he's taking it over to a spiritual form that this this is spir something spiritual is happening what's the spiritual gift is the gift of the Holy Ghost the gift of the Holy Ghost in your life and now this is something spiritual happening in verse six he says but now hath he obtained a more excellent Ministry by how much also he is the mediator of a better Covenant which was established upon better promises for if that first Covenant had been faultless there then should no place have been sought for the second if that first Covenant was fine then you wouldn't need a you wouldn't need a second Covenant you wouldn't need a a different kind of priesthood an eternal priesthood you wouldn't need you wouldn't need the gift of the Holy Ghost you wouldn't need eternal life if that first Covenant was not lacking for finding fault with him he saith behold the days come sayith the Lord when I will make a New Covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah and what's that new Covenant that Jeremiah talked about that that God's life that he would he would break just like melkisedek did he he broke bread and and and and served wine and Jesus was a which was a type of Jesus his flesh being torn and his life being poured out so that life could come back into the believer for this is the my blood of the new testament which is shed for many of the remission of sins is what Jesus said there in the upper room so in Jeremiah if we if we go back and read what that that prophecy of that new covenant is he said in in Jeremiah verse 31 of chapter 31 behold the days come sayth the Lord that I will make a New Covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah not according to the Covenant that I made with their fathers in the day that I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt which my Covenant they break although I was in husband unto them sayith the Lord but this shall be the Covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days sayith the Lord I I will put my law in their inward parts and write it in their hearts and will be their God and they shall be my people now that's a covenant now when God can take all of those 613 Commandments all those law all that Torah all the things that God came down off the mountain with and put it into your heart so that you can love your neighbor so that now you've got power to forgive somebody when they do something wrong to you because you've got the love of God in your heart that now you're actually fulfilling the essence of what the law is because the lawgiver is in your heart and it's not a book of rules but God is living it out in your life and they shall teach no more every man his neighbor and every man is brother saying know the Lord for they shall all know me from the least of them un the greatest of them sayith the Lord for I will forgive their iniquity and I will remember their sin no more you think about what a blessing it is that you can turn to your neighbor in church and when you walk out the doors that every holy ghost filled believer has got those Commandments in their heart and got the ability the power of God in their life to live those live those things out to to where the rest of the world can't love their neighbor but you can love your neighbor you can love somebody that smites you on your cheek and spits in your face because that's what the life of God gives you the power of God in the heart of the believer to fulfill the essence of the Commandment so in verse 8 and of of Hebrews 8 he says for finding fault with him he saith behold the days come sayith the Lord Lord when I will make a New Covenant with the house of Israel and and with the house of Judah not according to the Covenant that I made with their fathers in the day when I took them uh I I I I put this slide in here because I want to compare how Paul Paul what's he doing he's actually quoting what we just read in Jeremiah but I I I wanted to kind of call out cu you know sometimes people get a little bit critical and say well we're not quoting exactly but look how look how uh Paul he adds so he interpolates a little bit he adds his own little thought into his reading of Jeremiah and this is what I was talking about I was listening to to a rabbi and he really blasted Paul for doing this and saying he he said all kinds of but you know what Paul's doing is he's bringing forth the essence of what Jeremiah's saying he he's he's he's he's a he's he's elaborate he's putting his own words and things but the essence is the same as he quotes and he says not according to the so and right there in yell is is some of the things that Paul kind of he he throws in there as he's quoting Jeremiah not according to the Covenant that I made with their fathers in the day when I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt because they continue not in my Covenant and I regard them not sayith the Lord for this is the Covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days sayith the Lord I will put my laws into their mind and write them in their hearts and I will be to them a God and they shall be to me a people and they shall not teach every man his neighbor and every man his brother saying know the Lord For All Shall know me from the least to the greatest for I will be merciful to their unrighteousness and their sins and their iniquities will I remember no more now if you really study out the way that that the the uh New Testament preachers quot of the Old Testament they do this a lot when they're when they're preaching they'll take a scripture over here and scripture over there and they'll put it together and they'll add they'll add and they'll what what are they doing they're preaching now they're preaching from a revelation that it's not just something that just like uh they they're understanding the the meaning of what is needs to be communicated amen so brother Ram said you can't no matter what you do you quit drinking quit smoking quit telling lies go to church and try to do this and try to do that you're still carnal that's just law the law makes nothing perfect but what makes perfect Christ I might quit stealing quit quit lying quit stealing quit committing adultery quit chewing quit all the things and I'm still carnal God don't receive it because I have nothing to offer him in propitiation but the minute that I lay my hands upon the Blessed head of the Lord Jesus and say Lord I'm no good will you take me as your servant and God kisses away my sin I stand perfect in the sight of God that's right I'm not standing on my own Merit I'm standing on his and he has perfected us through his suffering and his blood you you think about now I got this picture of the cross the shadow of the Cross Laying across the scripture all of that that the that the Old Testament required all of that was fulfilled Christ that when he died on the cross if you're in Christ then the then the requirement has been met that the requirement has been satisfied because his blood paid the price for that but now I want to kind of get into something that's a little bit difficult to express is that is that there is no requirement to come to the Cross but after you come to the cross and you're in him then it changes your life there's a before and after before there's no requirement to come to the Cross but after you come to the cross and get it him it will change your life so Paul in in verse 13 He says in that he saith a New Covenant he hath made the first old now that which decayeth and waxeth old is ready to vanish away so I got these bullet points here Christ sacrifice met every requirement of the law if you are in Christ every requirement has already been met there's no requirement for you to do anything it's not how much you pray or how much you push a penny with your nose or all you have to do is believe on the Lord Jesus Christ to receive your salvation but the Life of Christ and the believer will become a living manifestation of the essence of the law and it begins to express outward in you so there's no way there's no requirement for you to come to Christ but when you come to Christ you become the the word manifest on two feet now now so so Jesus said and in chap Mark 12 he said and Jesus answered in the first of all the Commandments says here oh Israel the Lord our God is one Lord he's he's kind of summon everything up all the Ten Commandments all the law everything the Lord here oh Israel the Lord our God is one Lord and thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart and with all thy soul and with all thy mind and with all thy strength this is the first commandment you put the you put the life of God into a Believer and now they can fulfill that because they love God in the way that they should the way that the Old Testament was was laid out now it's not a commandment anymore now you love God and the second is like namely this Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself there is none other commandment greater than these now after after you're born again now you can love you're fulfilling that that law the law becomes manifest in you so that's why Romans chapter 8 says what for what the law could not do and that it was weak through the flesh God sending his own son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin condemn sin in the flesh that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit you're not walking after the dos and don'ts anymore but you're walking after after a new law a law of love for they that are after The Flesh do mind the things of the flesh but they that are after the spirit the things of the spirit for to be carnally minded is death but to be spiritually minded is life and peace peace because the carnal mind is enmity against God for it is not subject to the law of God so if you're spiritually minded you become subject to the law of God neither and inde can be so then they that are in the flesh cannot please God but ye are not in the flesh but in the spirit if so be that the spirit of God dwell in you now if any man have not the spirit of Christ he is none of his now also in Romans chapter 13 it says owe no man anything but what to love one another for he that loveth another hath fulfilled the law you get the eternal life that life of God in you and you're able to express the love of God then you actually are fulfilling the law that's what the Bible says for this Thou shalt not commit adulter Thou shalt not kill Thou shalt not steal Thou shalt not bear false witness Thou shalt not covet and if there be any other commandment is briefly comprehended in this saying it's all summed up and this Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself see the reason people commit adultery is because they don't love they don't love the the person that they're that they're they're talking to they don't love that girl that they're lusting after they don't I mean I don't mean like love like you want to get married to them they don't they they don't love them and as as part of like wanting to see them saved want to want to see their soul want them to see salvation the reason people kill is because they don't love love the reason people steal is because they don't love the the reason you know you talk about that sometimes the kids will go to camps and stuff and that somebody will steal their iPhone or steal something that was in their pocketbook the reason somebody does that is because they don't love they don't as a person as a Humanity they don't want to see them save they don't want the good for them they they they they don't uh you know they don't value them as in their Humanity Thou shalt not bear false witness that's the reason people lie is because they don't love thou shalt not covet covet to compare you know people say there's that saying that uh comparison is the is the thief of Joy when you covet something somebody else has got then your your joy is actually robbed and the the reason that people covet the reason you want the car that the neighbor's driving or something that somebody else has is because you don't love that's what I'm talking about that's what the the new birth gives you is love love to be able to love somebody else and when you love the the way that that that Paul is talking about here in Romans moments you are fulfilling the essence of the law love worketh no ill to his neighbor therefore love is the fulfilling of the law so in Galatians he says for Brethren ye have been called un Liberty only use not Liberty for an occasion to the flesh but by love serve one another for all the law all the law all that essence of the Old Testament law is fulfilled in this new covenant when Christ's life is put into the heart of the believer and you can love the way that God wanted you to from the beginning all the law is fulfilled in one word even in this Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself you know you know when you really think if you meditate on what that means that when somebody's going through a trial and maybe they slip up and fall you look at them with different eyes because you know I'm a human too and I'm going through stuff and I want somebody to give me Grace amen when you look at somebody and you because you love them you give them you give them a little more grace you give them you treat them a little bit differently because you realize we're we're all humans and we're all trying to get to the same goal if you fulfill the Royal law James said according to the scripture Thou shalt if you fulfill the Royal law Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself ye do well oh you see you see how so that's difficult to express there's no requirement to come to Christ there's nothing you have to do to work yourself up or something to come to Christ but after you come to Christ after you get in him it's going there's going to be something work out from your members it's going what's what's put on display love the love of God and first John said hereby perceive we the love of God because he laid down his life for us and we ought to lay down our lives for the Brethren but who so hath this world's good and seeth his brother have need and shutteth up his bowels of compassion from him how dwelleth the love of God in him my little children let us not love in word neither in tongue but in deed and Truth in first John again John so many so much of what he talked about was about based on love because he loved Jesus Christ whosoever believeth that Jesus is the Christ is born of God and everyone that loveth him that begat loveth him also that is begotten so if you love The Giver you going to love those that received eternal life if you love Jesus Christ you can't help but love me and you can't help but love one another because if you love Jesus you can't help but love those that have received him oh by that should change our our attitudes this morning when you think about you know know everybody in this building and maybe streaming it online loves God loves Jesus Christ and if you've received him you can't help but love one another amen by this we know that we love the children of God when we love God and keep his Commandments for this is the love of God that we keep his Commandments and his Commandments are not Grievous what what Commandments the 613 Commandments in the Old Testament that if you go back and read They're talking about how to be just to one another how to make good decisions they're not Grievous there they things that that uh you know just naturally we should just do to one another and when you got the eternal life of God living in you it will become natural because as you eat the word you become the word and you you're actually becoming what God wanted you to be love is the fulfilling of the law brother brand said in the brass serpent he said God has a law and that law is love God can't work against himself then if I love God correctly then I'm going to testify the truth about God if I'm in in love with him I've got a wife here's in the building God knows I love her well you know everything good and everything is going to be for my wife you know that sure just like your husband would be to you well now if we love God then my confidence becomes perfect in him as I love him now he can't break that law of Love see because it's in my heart now you think about on the left there I got what what is love in 1 Corinthians uh 13 will tell you so you know right there at the top of the list we of course we know brother R said love is corrective love is corrective because when you're doing wrong love will what love will straighten you out but love suffers long it's longsuffering maybe sometimes you got children out in the world and and you realize what long suffering is cu but you're patient love love love will wait a while cuz it's love love is kind love is not always putting somebody down and saying well you ain't worth nothing see I don't I don't like bullying and and putting down CU love love will lift you up love envieth not vth not itself is not puffed up CU love what's love trying to do prefer your brother does not behave itself unseemly seeketh not her own is not easily provoked you can poke somebody with love but they won't slap you back because they love you thinketh no evil rejoiceth not in iniquity but rejoiceth in the truth beareth all things believeth all things hopeth all things endureth all things and never fails love will never fail that brother man said what love cast out Devils love what CU love is the light I'm talking about real love agapy love love is the life of God that Zoey life that life will cast out Devils when you come in come home and your your kids are all running around act uh uh you know your wife's in a tizzy and and everything brother BR said you just come home and you just start straightening things up and and showing a little bit love and and that's I think that's a lesson for all of us uh myself included because love uh a hand slapped up against the face or strong words many times fail but love will always win the day amen so Paul said in Hebrews chapter 9 what are we talking about we talking about the law take that Old Testament law and putting it into the heart of the believer in a New Covenant that that law can be lived out in you and verily the first Covenant had also ordinances of divine service in a worldly Sanctuary for there was a tabernacle made the first wherein was the Candlestick and the table and the showbread which is called The Sanctuary he he's he's he making a point you could see all these things in the natural but now we're talking about something spiritual and after the second Veil The Tabernacle which is called the holiest of all which had the golden censor and the Ark of the Covenant overlaid roundabout with gold wherein was the golden pot that had mana and Aaron's raw that budded in the tables of the Covenant and over it the cherums of gold shouted on The Mercy Seat of which we cannot now speak particularly all of those things represented something what do they represent like like brother Louise and brother Wade have been breaking down the the rod that budded all all these things are speaking of the life of God and the believer that now you can eat of that Mana that they that they that only the high priest can eat of now now you can you can enter in and eat of that now now you can have that eternal life with that rod budded and and and you now those tables of stone are in the believer's heart now all of those things that we're just Shadows of now we've got the reality of it in our lives in Hebrews chapter 9 now when these things were thus ordained in verse 6 he said now the priest went always into the first Tabernacle accomplishing the service of God but into the second went the high priest alone once every year not without blood which he offered for himself and for The Heirs of the people the Holy Ghost is signifying it's about the Holy Ghost that the way into the holiest of all was not yet made manifest while as the first Tabernacle was yet standing which was a figure for the time then present in which we were offered both gifts and sacrifices that could not make him that did the service perfect as pertaining to the conscience if the musicians will go ahead and come forward which stood only in meats and drinks and diverse Washings and carnal ordinances imposed on them until the time of reformation but we've got something that can change our conscience change our thinking but Christ being coming high priest of good things to come by a greater and more perfect Tabernacle not made with hands that is to say not of this building neither by the blood of goats and calves calves but by his own blood he entered in once into the holy place having obtained Eternal Redemption for us what holy Place into your heart and we'll stop right there God bless you let's meditate on these things as we prepare for the [Applause] service
