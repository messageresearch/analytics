The Cry of the heart of the believer this morning amen is to see him amen we've not come together today to be seen or to be heard but we've come to see him Amen in the power amen of his resurrection and I believe the prophet of God told us over and over he said preaching the sermon sir we would see Jesus amen and he said now there's four ways you can see him he said you can see him in nature you can see him in the universe you can see him in his son see him in his word he said but then amen he brings it right down and you can see him in his people amen and this morning as we look across the

their walk with the Lord and amen it is a real special time here amen a first time to be ministering for brother Wade as Pastor here and so we sure um appreciate what the Lord is doing there in his ministry and life and amen we sure appreciate the Lord for amen continuing the work of God right here in the assembly amen I'm thankful that the Lord has uh has placed somebody here Amen to just carry on and to keep preaching the message and amen you know it's a it's a it's a beautiful thing to see such a work as brother uh Sam has established here in the years of Labor and all the effort and thing that's gone into it to see the message held high Amen in this community but then what a blessing it is to see it continuing on Amen it's not it's not falling to the ground it's not falling apart but God Amen is moving the work forward and amen I believe the next change will will be the Rapture amen and so we say God bless you brother Wade sister Junior amen we we sure love and appreciate you all and this morning if you have your Bibles we want to go to the word we're going to turn to the book of St John the 20th chapter the book of St John the 20th chapter we want to look here in the 18th verse of John chapter 20 we just have a few things here today to share with you on our heart and we just pray it'll be a blessing to you in the book of St John the 20th chapter and in the 18th verse the Bible here says that Mary Magdalene came and told the disciples that she had seen the Lord and that he had spoken these things unto her then the same day at evening being the first day of the week when the doors were shut where the disciples were assembled for the fear of the Jews Jesus came and stood in the midst now I love that came Jesus and stood in the midst now we know that in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and the Word was made flesh in Jesus so we could say that the word came and stood in the midst and saith unto them peace be unto you so now we have the word speaking peace be unto you and when he had so said he showed un them his hands and his side and then were the disciples glad when they saw the Lord then said Jesus to them again peace be unto you as my father hath sent me even even so send I you and when he had said this he breathed on them somebody say breathed on them bre he breathed on them and saith unto them receive ye the Holy Ghost now watch he breathes the word breathes on them and says receive ye the Holy Ghost then the very next verse speaks of the authority of the church and says whosoever sins ye remit they are remitted unto them and whosoever sins you retain they are retained amen let's just bow our hearts together this morning Heavenly Father we thank you for the opportunity to serve you today we thank you for the anointing that we F in your word Lord knowing that you are the same yesterday today and forever and Lord we know that you're in our midst today to minister to the needs of your children so father as we Endeavor to look into your word we invite the spirit of wisdom and Revelation to come into the building and to move in the power lord of the spirit Lord may you break every stronghold of the enemy oh God lord may you bring inspiration Lord may you bring change to hearts and lives and father I pray a special blessing upon our brother Wade upon his family oh God upon this assembly father Upon Our Brother Sam sister Peggy Lord I pray that your anointing oh God would rest upon them Father Lord may you bless this church Lord may you continue to use them Lord as a lighthouse in this community for the word that you've revealed in this generation now father we invite you have your way among us today God we love you Lord we thank you for your blessings in Jesus Christ's name we pray and all the Believers says amen and amen God Rich you bless you today amen I want you by the help of the Lord you can have your seats here for a moment amen I want you by the help of the Lord for just a moment today to speak to here and if I would title this today I want to talk to you about freshly inspired by the Breath of God Amen freshly inspired by the Breath of God you know I believe if there ever was a time amen that we could use a refreshing or a freshness amen I believe that time is right now and you know uh as we look at that word refresh of course you know the root word of refresh is fresh and that word fresh means having its original qualities unimpaired amen having its original qualities unimpaired full of or renewed in Vigor it's not stale it's not sour it's not decayed it's not faded amen and it's not all altered by processing so when something is original or something is fresh amen it's not altered there's nothing added to it there's nothing taken away from it amen it still has its original qualities now when you look at that word qualities it is the standard of something amen as measured against other things of a similar kind it is the degree of Excellence of something it is a distinctive attribute amen or characteristic that is possessed amen by someone or something so when something amen is original it has an original quality amen and it's still packing the the the characteristic or the distinctive attribute amen that has been given to be manifested in that now says it very beautiful he said Jesus amen was possessed with all the fine qualities of God and you all know in Matthew chapter 4 the Bible said that Jesus met Satan amen and there the devil tempted him three times amen and here is Jes Jesus with all of these qualities because all that was in God he poured into Christ and all that was in Christ he has poured into to the church right amen then here is Jesus with the fine qualities of God but when he meets the devil he does not use one of those qualities but rather he uses this the word amen and says it is written brother said what was he doing he was bringing the power and the authority of the word amen into the reach of the weakest of Christian now amen I believe that there's power in the word of God I believe there is Authority in the word of God now maybe just for a moment to read here something to lay a foundation to draw our thought from brother says here speaking on hear ye himm in 1956 from Matthew 17 he's speaking of Jesus on Mount Transfiguration and he says you know God's word is so Eternal it's so inspired he said it's not just for one occasion or for one generation he said but the word of God is so Eternal it's the same it's the truth amen the word of God is eternal the word of God is the same and the word of God is the truth he said now this same word inspired the disciples it inspired the first row of disciples and then the next is they follow amen down to the Lutheran age down to the Methodist age and every age amen and is just as sufficient and inspiring today to us amen as it was the first day it was given and if the world should stand a million years amen that word would still be just as inspired to the generations that will follow amen us as it is to us because it's perfect it's always given for the time he said one great way we could approach it this afternoon as the coming of the Lord see the first as Moses then Elijah then Jesus he said but then we noticed that Peter while he was there he had just been freshly inspired amen because he had just given a witness to who Jesus was amen and he was was inspired now when a man is inspired and he reads the inspired word amen then the two Inspirations gives a result no matter how well you study the word amen it'll never do you no good till you are inspired yourself amen it takes your inspiration the word is already inspired so what we need today here's a prophet now what we need today is an inspiration over us amen God sweeping down with a new inspiration and breathing over us his power amen his love and himself that it might Inspire us to Quicken us amen and to awaken us through his word when the word being brought in the spirit of inspiration then you'll see miracles happen and things take place because the two amen just comes together so what we need today amen is not a new chart we don't need a new book or we don't need a new doctrine amen but we need the inspiration amen of the word of God to breathe over the Church of God Amen and when those two Inspirations comes together amen there is where you will see Miracles take place now I want to say this the word of God Amen is not like the word of a man amen the word of a man has a certain meaning amen or an expression for a Time amen but the word of God has an eternal meaning amen down Through the Ages Amen in other words if there was healing in the beginning there will be healing in the end if there was salvation in the beginning there will be salvation in the end whatever was in the alpha amen will be in the Omega come on church amen there will be a bride who will not be stale she will not be sour she will not be decayed she will not be diluted amen she will still have the same qualities manifested in her that was manifested in the groom every generation can pick up the same word because it is inspired it is eternal it is Everlasting lasting it is a nonfading declaration from God no matter if the apostles read it in their age it meant something for them if Wesley read it in his age and Luther in his age and Calvin in his age amen but yet today it's just as brilliant and bright and got just as much of an effect amen as it did for them on the very day it was spoken amen because it's God's word now you say our words St John you come over to my house I'll be glad to see you that's our words it just means John come over to our house amen but when God speaks somebody say when God speaks amen when God speaks it's Eternal amen it's breathed from the very breath of the immortal Everlasting Creator himself amen so when God speaks it's not coming amen from the ideas of a temporary mind when God speaks it's not coming from a finite mind but when God speaks it's coming from an infinite mind amen and it is the very Breath of God amen speaking the Creator himself I'll say this to you I believe that the message of the hour amen has brought the word of God Amen back to the Church of God Amen by the Breath of God and that word has come unto us unaltered oh come on church amen it's come unaltered it's not processed it's not hybridized amen it's a pure original word with the same qualities that it had Amen in the beginning and I believe if that word is has come to us that word amen must have the preeminence the word of God must have first place in the service it must have first place in our life it must be first place in our thoughts amen for it is eternal and it shall never pass away my word has to be altered like another man's word time has to be altered or altered rather to meet time but Thy word never changes there's no altering to God's word it's forever the same and now holy spirit author of this word word will you come and open it for us tonight and may the speaker be so submissive until you'll be able to come in and take the word of God and place it right out into every Hungry Heart and may there at lodge and find its Abiding Place and may it bring forth fruit 100-fold amen salvation healing joy and peace listen I want to say this God forbid amen we ever water this message down Amen to just some teaching or just some intellectual Gathering amen God forbid we ever take the authority and the power to produce joy and peace and salvation out of the word of God Amen I love what the Bible says there Amen in job 32:8 it says but there is a spirit in man amen and the inspiration of the almighty amen giveth them understanding now when you look at that word inspiration the word inspiration there actually means breath amen I love that it means breath it means Spirit it is the Breath of God Amen now watch this amen every breathing thing Spirit of man now I'll say it like this in other words amen the breath of the almighty amen giveth them understanding in other words when God begins to breathe understanding begins to come in the church in job 33:4 the spirit of God hath made me and the breath of the almighty amen hath given me life brother said oh God who formed the heavens and the Earth you just let your breath go forth with his word and everything Tak in its right position the Earth the moon the stars they all swung into place just as God breathed on his word he said oh God today we ask amen that you'll breathe on your word as we are trying to bring it to the people may it take its position this morning its place and be rooted and grounded in every heart amen that every person here amen might receive your blessings so let me say this there's a connection amen between when God breathed and things taken their position when God breathed the moon took its position when God breathed the Stars took their position when God breathed the Earth took its position listen if God can breathe over the natural creation and it come into its position I believe he can breathe over the spiritual creation and he can move every believer into their position in the body of Jesus Christ amen every breath that we breathe amen comes from God every breath that we breathe it comes from God now in Genesis chapter 2 as you study your Bible you will find amen that Genesis 2 is the first time amen that the word breath is mentioned in the Bible in Genesis 2:7 the Bible said the Lord God Amen form man of the Dust of the earth of the ground and he breathed into his nostrils the breath of life amen and Man became a living Soul so there is a connection between the Breath of God Amen and man coming into his position brother said I can see Adam standing let's take it this way see him standing there like a tree God had made him he was dead as he could be his toes like the root sticking in the ground amen but God said let there be Amen brother said let there be or breathe the breath oh God or breathe the breath of life into him and he jumped and came to himself amen the same thing that he said in Genesis 1 let there be the moon Let There Be The Stars let there be the firmament amen and God God said let there be amen and there was by the Breath of God I'll say this to you amen if you go to the Book of Luke 15 you will see that there was a prodal amen who was in the pig pin amen he was out of his position as a son in his father's house amen but I believe that the same breath amen that breathed upon Adam amen and caused him to come to himself and realize he's not a tree amen but he's a creation of the Mighty God is the same breath that went to the pigs pin and breathed over the prodal sign and said you do not belong here amen but you got a father's house and you got a position in that house and Church of the Living God Amen that's the same breath that has breathed across this church in the last days amen come out of the world come out of confusion come out of Babylon and come into your position by the word of God Amen I believe it I believe the Breath of God has the ability to move things into their position when you start talking about this Breath of God you will realize that the Breath of God is connected to Creation amen and creation is connected to the Breath of God in Psalms 33:6 by the word of the Lord were the heavens made and all the host of them amen by the breath of his mouth in Isaiah 42:5 amen thus sayith the Lord thus sayith God the Lord he that created the heavens and stretched them out he that spread forth the Earth and that which cometh out of it now watch this he that giveth breath unto the people upon it amen and spirit to them that walk therein so he's the creator of the heavens he's the creator of the earth he's the Creator amen of the things that is inhabiting the earth amen but that same Creator amen turns around and gives breath to his creation and spirit to his creation Amen to walk in what he has created he said you are The God Who breaths the forth amen the first breath of life ever come in the earth and has control of every life amen until this present time and shall forever more control for thou art the creator of all mankind and all things that breathe he said I think of you when you walked here in Galilee up on the mountains at night time amen watching the great planations and so forth amen great planets of the heavens and the solar system knowing that you made them now watch this you spun them out with your hand and you blow your breath in the palm of your hand and every Star come into existence amen when you see the stars in the sky they didn't come into existence by some manufacturing of some Factory somewhere they come into existence amen by the breath of almighty God come on Sir amen is it okay to preach or y'all ready go home Amen in Isaiah 14 you know what the Bible said the Bible said that the devil would exalt himself amen above the stars of God he would try to exalt himself above the stars of God Amen but he would be brought low you know what the prophet of God said he said the stars of God Amen are the sons of God you know the prophet of God said that God reserved Isaiah 14 for the last day amen when the son of predition would be revealed what was the son of predition doing he was trying to disposition amen the sons of God Amen as the Messiah EDS of this generation but the same breath amen that put the devil in his place back there has returned to the church in the last days and it'll put the devil in his place here today I want to tell that devil this morning he will never disposition this bride he will never pull us out of our position because a devil didn't give it to us and a devil can't take it away a man didn't give it to us and a man can't take it away our position has been revealed by the breath of almighty God and there ain't no devil can take it there ain't no Spirit can bind you from positionally placing in the word of God Amen the Breath of God has breathed upon this generation I love what the prophet says he said God wants to be God Amen how many agree with there amen God wants to be God and if he ain't God he ain't going to be second place he don't have to let bail and some man-made dogma and some theory of some man or some idea of a Creed or some idea a denomination standing his way he's God look at somebody next to you and say he's God he's God and he's able these stones to rise children to Abraham he don't have to have your denomination he don't have to have your big societies and schools he takes what he can get in his hand he takes what he can get in his hand that is nothing amen and breathes the breath of life into it and it becomes something that'll serve him amen that's what makes him God amen what makes him God is he takes something in his hand that is nothing amen and he breathes upon it and causes it to be something and when he does that amen that gives him the position as The God Who can do anything any time anywhere any place under any condition listen if God saved you he didn't save you to put you on a Pew and make you just a church member if God redeemed you he didn't redeem you just to put you in a Pew and make you some cold formal intellectual but he redeemed you for a purpose he saved you for a purpose and if God is able these stones to rise children unto Abraham my God can come in this building this morning and he can take a bunch of nobodies amen and save them by his grace and fill them with his spirit and breathe upon them with his word and Inspire them amen renew them reveal to him amen who he is in the power of his resurrection listen I believe our God is God and he's able to do anything he's able to open the Red Sea he's able to set the mouths of lines he's able to raise the dead he's able to heal the sick he's able to save the Lost he's able to break addictions he's able to send Revival he's able to send to refreshing he's able to send to renewing listen have we forgot our God is able He's Able amen he's able let me say this if he's able amen then we ought to be be willing to be able come on you say preacher amen I don't know about that our God is able and if he is able we ought to be willing to be able Amen to move with the spirit of God when the spirit of God begins to move amen I love this breath amen amen breath is a sign of life you know that you know that that breath is a sign of life amen and let me say this if there is no breath amen there is no life amen if somebody fell over and you called 911 and you called them up and they said hey hey we need some we need an ambulance down here you know what's the first thing they're going to say are they breathing amen are they breathing now watch what the prophet says he said now the baby is born with live muscles a beaten heart but there's no Breath of Life in it its muscles are twitching see but then see if there was something different from that if there wasn't a spirit that had come into it later then our breath could leave us and we would Breathe No More and still be alive remember he is the Creator and he giveth breath to the creation and spirit to walk therein amen now watch but when this body doesn't receive oxygen or breath watch a prophet the intake Amen in the outtake of our lungs he says then we are dead if the body does not intake oxygen and outtake then we are dead you know what the intake and outtake of your lungs is they work together Amen to bring oxygen into the body and take out carbon dioxide which is a waste product out so in other words there's some things that's got to come in but there's some things that's got to go out are you hearing me there's some things that's got to come in but then there's some things that's got to go out in other words you got to breathe in oxygen but you got to breathe out carbon dioxide can I say this to you if you only breathe in and don't breathe out you'll die are are you with me now now I'm going to bring it in the church okay because a church has got to breathe in and a church has got to breathe out if a church just breathes in breathes in breathes in amen that church will die amen because as you're breathing in some things are going to come in that don't belong amen and the only way to get them out is to breathe them out and the only one that can breathe them out amen is the word of God and when you begin to preach the message of the hour the Breath of God begins to blow across the church and it'll blow out sin it'll blow out bad ad udes it'll blow out little funny feelings it'll blow out little oh we might as well preach we're here it'll blow out all kinds of things and that's what makes a church strongl are you hearing me there's some things got to come in and there's some things got to go out can I say this we've got to inhale the promises and we got to Exhale the problems we've got to inhale the word and we got to Exhale Traditions we've got to inhale the blessings and we got to Exhale the curses we got to inhale the anointing and we got to Exhale the spirit of confusion come on church we got to inhale fellowship and we got to Exhale division we got to inhale vision and we got to Exhale wondering in the wilderness are you hearing me as the Church of the Living God we got to breathe in some things but we got to breathe out some things amen come on spoken word are you want to be a strong church are you wanting to keep on moving forward are you wanting to still believe the promises of God then start breathing again come on start breathing again amen breathe out all the confusion breathe out all that he didn't shake my hand and I don't agree with that and I don't like that breathe all that out and let the wind of God come back in the church again until our young people can breathe until our musicians can breathe until our preachers can breathe until our singers can breathe we need the power of the Holy Ghost to come in the Dynamics of the resurrection and breathe over the church again until we can see God in the power of His word I'm talking about breathing I'm talking about breathing I'm talking about breathing I'm I might as well preach I'm here amen if you're going to breathe you know what the next thing breath is connected to it's connected to praise breath is connected to praise my Bible says amen let everything that ha breath praise ye the Lord you know what the prophet of God said in think of man's filter he said Grant Lord that we may know how that we should give you praise it's beyond our understanding to know how to give you praise listen but when the spirit of insiration comes when God begins to breathe amen there will be an understanding that will come in the church I say this let everything that hath breath amen praise ye the Lord David again says praise ye the Lord now let's just say praise the Lord that's a direct quote let's just say praise the Lord amen amen let's let's just go ahead let's just go ahead and put that no praising God devil out of the building praise the Lord Lord praise the Lord but I don't feel like it Praise Him anyhow well I don't sense Him Praise Him anyhow well I'm broke Praise Him anyhow well I don't feel good Praise Him anyhow David said let everything that hath breath praise ye the Lord well brother Andrew one day I'm going to get good enough to praise him you are not praising him because of how good you are you are not praising him because of how much you know you are praising him because of who he is come on well one day when I get saved enough I'll praise him well when one day I get righteous enough I'll praise him you're not praising him based on how you are based on your condition come on hey let me say this he deserves praise no matter what you're going through because he's God he's the way maker he's The Miracle Worker he's the soul saer he's the problem fixer he's the devil defeating God I say we ought to open up the praise of God in the Church of God and let every nervous devil get more nervous we ought to praise God we ought to worship him we ought to bless his name I'm talking about opening up the house of God for some praise again well we might as well preach for here amen whatever happened to just getting together and having Church y'all remember we used to just get together we didn't care who was there and who wasn't there and who was preaching and who wasn't preaching and who was singing amen we were just happy Amen to be in the number one more time we would sing till the glory fail we would preach till the anointing broke out I tell you what happened amen some problems come in and some situations come in and we let those things shut up our praise and up our worship but you know what I say today I say it's time to let a stick of the Holy Ghost Dynamite amen droing the church again and blow all the channels out until a praise can arise from the seat of God I'm talking about praising God I'm going to say this to you there's some things amen that the only thing going to get you through is praise there's some situations the only thing going to get you back in the house of God on Wednesday night is Just letting go and praising God you know what the devil wants us to do the devil wants to throw everything he can against us and then he wants us to back up and quit but you know what I believe it's time to do I believe it's time to praise God like we've never praised him before I think it's time to bless his name I think it's time to love his word I think it's time to love his people I think it's time to serve the anointing I think it's time church amen to let the praise of the almighty God arise in the soul of the believer listen ain't a bunch of Pentecostals amen worshiping and praising a bunch of air no we know who we're praising we know who we're worshiping we know who we're shouting about we're shouting about Jesus we're preaching about the message we're praising The God Who was the god who is and the god which shall forever be hallelujah hallelujah amen don't you just love that amen he says that sweet mellow Holy Spirit just breath in upon us like see it's so simple then all the starts we got back in it again brother there and then all the starch and all the intellectuals of the world has been taken away he said then the spirit's just worshiping he said worshiping God through us the holy spirit is making intercessions and breathing out worship think about that church the Holy Ghost is in you making intercessions but at the same time it is breathing out worship listen God has come into His creation and through his creation he is returning praise back to himself are you hearing me he has come into you he is breathing you brother Nate and through you he is returning praise back to himself in other words there ain't nobody can praise him like his creation there ain't nobody can worship him like his creation there ain't nobody that can give him what is due his name like his creation let me say this when the inspired word is preached amen I'll say this it will inspire a Believer and it will cause a praise I remember told that story about out there in Tucson you know he said we went down there that Baptist Church he said we didn't have nowhere else to go he said so we went in that Baptist Church he said we went in there he said we all sat down and he said the guy got up started preaching he said after a while he said something about Israel leaving Egypt you know he said they were all he said they left Egypt they were eating the garlic and the and the and she said you know he said well that's something like a lot of people today you know brother said we all turned around and said amen you know he said I never seen a bunch amen the whole church lost sight of the preacher and looked back to see who it was and said amen it like to scared them to death they didn't know what it was he said but David said Make a Joyful Noise unto the Lord and praise Him upon the harps Praise Him upon the Sury let everything that hath breath praise ye the Lord are you ready for this God rejoice es in his people hallelujah amen God rejoices in his people amen I don't mean to pick on you sis amen but just a few minutes ago when that anointing got on you and you stood up and was rejoicing amen that wasn't our sister amen but that was God Amen rejoicing in his word come on when the anointing Moves In You amen that's not a feeling that's not a sensation that's not a bad thing to respond to the word amen hallelujah glory to God Amen sometime or another if don't let it out you'll hurt yourself amen so you just got to let it out hallelujah praise the Lord amen that's the truth preacher what are you doing it's God rejoicing in his people to his word I love what brother says here he said God rejoices in his people he said let them of the learn say Amen only a Kentucky Prophet can say that let them of the Learned Say Amen when anything is said right now don't get mad at me but when Hatty R heard the word she didn't nod and she didn't wink come on church and she didn't give a thumbs up come on Sir she didn't she didn't bow her head or raise her hand or clap her she said that ain't nothing but the truth are you hearing me in other words there was something on the inside of her that responded to the word and the amen come out and there was an agreement between what she was hearing amen and the manifestation of the miracle listen can I say this amens are a powerful thing in the house of God you you want to change the atmosphere of a church amen just get you about two good amen or and let one say amen and another say amen and before long somebody else will say amen and then somebody else will say are you hearing me amen be a whole church amen of amens you know what that means that means so be it come on church when the word Goes Forth and you say amen amen stands for finality amen stands for so be it amen stands for the way it's been spoken is the way it shall be and this word is being preached to you unaltered amen not decayed not sour you ought to say Amen when the preacher says the seven seal is open you ought to say Amen when he says our God is a redeemer you ought to say Amen when he says our God Is A Healer you ought to say Amen when he says our God is a deliver you ought to say Amen I'm talking about bring back amens to the house of God I was preaching over Jason Watkins one time I made a statement I said make Holiness great again you know brother Jason said we going to make some hats like that you know what I say this morning I say make amen's great again are you hearing me amen and bring back amens to the house of God they belong in the house of God well brother andw we got to be real quiet and we can't say much well well where else are you going to say Amen well brother Andy you know the house of God ain't a place to cut up well where else are you going to cut up glory to God brother you know the house of God we got to you know we just got to we just got to stay real bound is that what you're trying to tell me no no Liberation has come the word is The Liberation listen when you hear the word agree with it now you say brother you're getting the way out there well brother brand preaches a beautiful sermon and calls it Blasphemous names brother begins to teach on this thought of breath and when he opens this thought he says now I'm going to correct the Jehovah Witness teaching he said because they believe that the breath you breathe is the soul he said that's not right he said now the breath is wind and wind is what you breathe into your nostrils then he goes to Genesis 2 speaking of Adam he said but what God did was he breathed the breath of eternal life amen then he became a living Soul see a soul that cannot die now watch notice breathe the breath of eternal life into his nostrils and he became an eternal Soul cuse God breathed not what nature done but what God did see breathed the breath of life into his nostrils and he become a living Soul well then you say to me Adam died brother brandom but remember before Adam died he had a lamb that redeemed him Hallelujah those he forne he is called he got a lamb to redeem them he was a type amen Adam failed and the lamb was provided for Adam because already in his nostrils I love this already in his nostrils had be come on now had become the breath of the Eternal God and he become a living Soul he was a Son of God he said not his breath as the African word which is amoia he said now see that means the wind or the Unseen Force he said animals breathe them Oya and sinners breathe them Oya he said but God especially upon Adam he breathe the breath of eternal life and he become an eternal person with God he had power like God he was an amateur God he was God of the earth not God Of Heaven now God of the earth and so here it is and someday amen the sons of God will again become Gods that's why the devil hates amen the preaching of this message is because it is the breathing of the Eternal God coming over the Church of God listen and as he breathes you're becoming gods of the earth Jesus said is it not written in your law ye are Gods then if you can call those who he called God who God visited how can you condemn me see when I say I am the Son of God then may I announce to you this morning amen that you are the true church amen the sons of God Amen and you are born amen by the Breath of God the church is the mystical Body of Christ born amen of the Breath of God the Church of God is born of the Breath of God God Brea in the nostril spiritually of Adam he become a living Soul did you know the Pentecostals or the true Pentecostal church is born amen of the Breath of God remember read St John 20 and then he says now watch the father that sent him went in him the father that sent him went in him and Jesus when he sends a disciple he goes in him he said now the church born of the Breath of God when this stature has molded itself up there in condition God's breath breathe upon them receive you the Holy Ghost then you are a son of God you can join anything you want to but you are born into the Church of the Living God you are born by the Breath of God God breathed upon them now can I preach to you God breathed upon them and said receive ye the Holy Ghost he breathed upon them and said receive ye the Holy Ghost there you are not come and join put your name on there with your soup suppers and all that goes with you join a lodge you join a Methodist Lodge a Baptist Lodge a presbyterian Lodge a Catholic or Pentecostal Lodge anything you want to join but you join a lodge but when you become a a child of God you are born amen by the Breath of God can I say this the Church of the Living God did not join the church amen you were born in the church by the word brother said that's how we have eternal life it's because we were spoken into existence by God not joined into a church but born by the word the original seed that God said let there be and there was then the same breath that said let there be to Adam and he come to his position is the same breath that is breathing through this adoption message and is saying let there be a bride let there be a Rapture let there be a resurrection let there be a victory let there be a miracle and as he begins to breathe things begin to happen listen I believe it I believe God watches over his word I believe God watches over his word and I believe God Reveals His word now can I say this the revelation of the word is the INSP eration of the age when you see the church getting worly like it was in the days of Sodom you see the church going in the worship the God of this evil age and seeing that amen but then seeing a little minority group gathered out under the inspiration of God producing again amen the life of Jesus Christ by the scriptures that's supposed to happen you know what hour you're living in did not Jesus say no man come to me except my father draws him remember said what is it amen can can we say this together it's the word joining with the word it's the word joining with the word it can't do nothing else the word cannot join a feeling the word cannot join an emotion the word cannot join a denomination it cannot join an organization the only thing the word can join is the word in other words we are called by the word we are called by the word can I say it like this the written word amen called out to the predestinated word and there was a union between the word now can I can I can I just ask you a very a very blunt question will that be okay are we sufficiently impressed with the word are we sufficiently impressed with the word said now Jesus knew there was going to be a Terri drift away from the word of the pergam church age which was yet 200 years off from the Patmos fishion he knew that drift would cause them to go into the Dark Ages he knew that way man would originally get away from God was by first leaving the word now watch can I say what a prophet said if you leave that word you have left God thus he has presented himself to the church at pergamus and indeed to all Church ages I oh God I am the word it's if you want deity in your midst then welcome and receive the word don't never let anyone or anything get between you and the word this which I am giving you the word is a revelation of myself I am the word remember that then he says I wonder if we are sufficiently impressed with the word in our midst let me give you a thought here how do we pray we pray in Jesus name don't we every prayer is in his name or there isn't any answer 1 John 5:14 this is the confidence we have in him that if we ask anything according to his will he heareth us and if we know that he hear us who soever we ask whatsoever we ask we know that we have the petitions that we desired of him he said now we ask what is the will of God there is only one way to know his will and that is by the word of God let me just let me just preach here for a second amen don't you take this bride amen back into following gifted men with gifts and feelings and Sensations and well brother so and so saw this brother so and so had this visitation brother so and so had this word amen we have got the Vindicated absolute authority of the word of God Amen it's an absolute and we ought to tie Our Lives to it come on we might as well preach here come on a we ought to tie Our Lives to it and stand on the word of God and let the devil back up but don't you ever back off of this message well brother Andrew it's brother so H God we will preach well we're here hadn't we well brother Andrew brother so and so but but listen amen if a prophet taught something amen either say what he said come on say what he said or just tell us you don't believe what he said so we can move on is that okay well brother Andrew we believe the message but we're going to do something different here talk this but we're going to let this well come on church amen I've done come through too many trials somebody day they spender you ought to back up a little bit you know amen preaching that message so strong is the absolute I said if I back up now I owe Brothers phone calls to apologize amen for standing with this message against their ideas and against their Traditions but I will never apologize for standing with what the seventh angel taught it's the Vindicated absolute of this generation and I will not back off of it for nobody nowhere no time under any circumstances because I want to see real Miracles I want to see real gifts I want to see real manifestation but the only way it's going to come is by the word well we might as well preach for here are we sufficiently impressed with the word in our midst who is he that saith and it come to pass when the Lord commandeth it not there it is if it isn't in the word then you cannot have it so we cannot ask unless it's in the word and we cannot petition or ask unless it's in his name there it is is again Jesus the name is the word the will and you cannot separate God and the word they are one now then this word he is Left Behind on the printed page is a part of him so when you accept it by faith into a Spirit-filled life he said his word was life John 663 there it is he is spirit and he is life that is exactly what the word is that is exactly what Jesus is he is the word so when a spirit born Spirit-filled man in faith takes that word into his heart places it up on his lips while that is the same as deity speaking Every Mountain has to go amen Satan cannot stand before that man if the church way back there in that third age had only held on to the revelation of the Living Word in their midst the power of God would not have faded as it did in those Dark Ages but right today when the church right today right today when the church returns to the word and faith we can say without doubt that the glory of God and the wonderful acts of God will be in her midst again come on church he did not say are we sufficiently impressed with signs he said are we sufficiently impressed with the word but although we believe in signs right we don't dismiss there signs we believe in signs but we don't follow signs you say preacher why because signs can be impersonated but the word cannot be impersonated somebody say well brother Andrew we just need some gifted brother to come speak over us or or just see something or prophesy or discern us amen amen come on Church we're not a bunch of Pentecostal babies amen wondering through Pentecost trying to find the direction we have had a messiah sign that is coming this generation and it spoke the word of God and it didn't miss one time can I preach brother Wade it didn't miss one time you could put it under any kind of pressure you wanted to but it never missed you can listen to 8,000 sermons rather 8,000 discernments and never hear one time where somebody said that's wrong or you missed it there and I'll say this without any hesitation any man that claims to have the discernment of the Messiah side is a false prophet and he ought to sit down and of the thing because there was one gift to an age there was one Messiah signed to an age and I refused to follow any carnal impersonation of the Vindicated manifestation of the return of the Messiah to this generation you say preacher you're getting way out there I'm passionate about these things we've had enough confusion it's time for some direction it's time for some clarity it's time to move [Music] forward brother Ander brother you don't understand no I do understand there's one thing the devil cannot impersonate and that's the word right now you know why people back off the word and go back to gifts don't you it's because they're really not in love with the word because there sometimes you just got to go to church and preach and you don't get a shout meeting you can clean it up when I leave wait there's sometimes you don't have a shout meeting but you just got to stand there and lay the H him but do you see where Pentecost failed is they couldn't take a good word service they couldn't satisfy oh God honey go start the van they couldn't satisfy and then they could not be satisfied with the word of God so they said well he's he's here somebody get on the drums he's here let's dance the devil out he's here let's shout the devil out amen but listen Jesus didn't shout the devil down he didn't dance the devil down he put the word against that devil and defeated the devil on the word Hallelujah and if we're going to defeat the Devil we got to come back to the word you say preacher you don't believe in shouting yes I believe in shouting yes I believe in dancing amen but let the word have the preeminence of our shout and let the word have the preeminence of our dance and let the word be the reason why that we shake for singles off the roof because the word has come into our midst and there's deity in our midst there's Mountain Moving faith in our midst come on church I'm I'm I'm trying to tell you something anchor yourself to to the [Music] word can I share something say well brother we need a prophec here we need a we need a gift we need somebody to prophesy over us I remember one time I was I was in a service and there was a situation in the church you know a guy got up and there was there was a musician in the church he had left the church backslid this guy gets up there and oh yeah I say unto thee you know I see thou my servant he shall return and play this instrument he called the instrument went through all these things he said he shall turn that's thus sayith the Lord you know I said well all I can say is what the prophet said if it's thus sayith the Lord it'll be thus and if it's not the man's got a Lon Spirit on him see brother Bob I may be young but I remember when we gave than the word test I remember when we used to check things by the message and not by the person saying [Applause] it I remember when we used to take it back to the tapes and say that's right or that's wrong but now we say well it's brother so and so so it's right or it's sister so and so so it's right amen let me say this on record brother so and so's wrong and sister so and so's wrong and the message of the hour is right I don't care who it is the message of the hour is right come on somebody get something says I have church say amen and some says well that's say for you know I cut it off amen amen amen now watch I lost it my ear he said like this he says now that's thus sayith the Lord he said now watch he said he'll come back okay we're just going to believe him take him you know that's that say the Lord so so somebody comes along you know and they say well brother we want to play this instrument they said no you can't play that instrument there's a prophecy over it you know said you can't play that there was a prophecy over that so they said well well well why not and they said well this been prophesied this brother's coming back to play so the brother was living in one state and about two weeks later the people hear that the brother's moving to about three states away they get up and they say you know brother so ando's moving out of state I think we ought to have a meeting about selling this instrument hold it I thought you had thus sayith the Lord I don't care if he moves to 10 Buck two I don't care if he moves to Outer Space if you have the sayith the Lord you leave it there and the boy's going to come back and play it but what you have is somebody's impression and not thus sayith the Lord but thank God in the last days we have come back to thus sayith the Lord without Impressions without feelings we have a clear thus sayith the Lord from the message we have it is written now brother said like this he said we believe in signs amen but are we sufficiently impressed with the word in our midst now let me say this to you remember said the thousands he said I with thousands of sign workers in this last day has created are you hearing me has created a generation of sign Seekers so whatever you're creating is what you're responsible to keep alive he created the earth and the things therein and he breathed into the creation and give a spirit to walk in it God is responsible for this message but can I say this he's not responsible for anything outside of this message so if you start a direction I don't know why I'm here but I'm preaching if you start a direction apart from the message you better make sure you got enough to keep it alive 20 years down the road because God will not sustain it but this message has been here for years and it still as fresh today as it was when it was put on tape you know why because God backs this message yes amen now how can you tell them give them the word test how can you know it speak the word see what they say about it if they don't believe the word they have no seed germ in them they are of the evil one and deceive you and the first bride was deceived the second bride was deceived they are deceivers of the third bride by high breing the word or trying to do so listen God never placed signs ahead of his word he said that's a scorcher God never plac sign ahead of his word they oh they were added for the proof of the word ready for this but the word was first to prove that Elijah said the woman make me a cake first then watch the miracle happened see come to the word first and then watch the miracle the seed word itself is what the Holy Spirit energizes see then the pr of God said where does the miracle take place you begin to believe God's word and then the miracle takes place on the word because the word is the seed that brings forth a miracle you got to take the word first the holy spirit gives it life like water falling from Heaven I I never can talk about signs and wonders without thinking about Danny steon one time brother Danny was preaching a youth camp I was in it probably last year I was a camper there and he got two boys on the front row and he said now I'm going to rename you he said your signs and your wonders that's right he said I'm the believer he said now follow me Mark 16 says signs and wonders shall follow them that believe brother Danny took off walking and here was signs and wonders they took off walking you know what he never did Brother Wade he never stopped and looked back to see if they was there he never got down and had a prayer meeting to make sure signs and wonders was there he just took off walking as a Believer and signs and wonders followed him hallu I love it he said if I speak speed up they speed up if I slow down they slow down I love this one he walked off the platform into a dark room and he said if I go in dark places they go with me are you hearing me we are word Believers we're not following signs and wonders signs and wonders are following the word can I give you another illustration amen and listen we don't F we don't follow signs of wonders because they don't have the direction the word sets the direction now I'll say this to you what we got to do is unclog the channel and let the word move in and when the word moves in then the devil can't move us watch this when you know you've done exactly what God told you to do then wait for the channel of inspiration to open up to you and now I'm Healed when it drops in there then it's all over see you don't need no prayer lines or nothing else it's over it's been revealed to you why do we follow the word because the word cannot be impersonated in other words look at Simeon now Simeon received a revelation I will not die until I have seen the Lord's Christ you know what the prod of God said he said nothing could shake him it was revealed to him Simeon come to the temple at the T at the minute walked over and give praise to God now what did he say let thy servant amen depart in peace when he picked up the baby mine eyes have seen my salvation see he knowed he was going to see it can I show you why we don't follow signs and wonders we don't follow anything but the word brother said no matter how many babies he would visit each day he knew that God had revealed to him he was going to see the Christ before he died hallelujah amen so you could have put a baby in simeon's arm and he knew it wasn't the one you could have put a baby in simeon's arm and said here Simeon you're getting old buddy you you just need to just accept this and go on but Simeon had a revelation by the word and he knew that when the Revelation come into manifestation there would be a direct Revelation in his heart and would say that's it are you hearing me listen friends said job he had I'm coming down now he had a way of moving himself out and let the word of God move in remember said I've often said the greatest enemy I've got is William Brandon he's the one that gets in God's way he's the one that gets lazy he's the one that gets to a place sometimes he can thinks he can do something about it and when he does that shes God right out of the picture but when I can get rid of that guy when I can get to a place that he's out of the way then God can come over and do things that will Willam brandom knows nothing about that's when God can use you when he can use any of us he can use somebody when we get out of the way when we listen when we get ourselves out of the way then the inspired word moves in and does things proba to God said now listen oh it's a great thing to come up here and preach a gospel that can make people actually that was once bootleggers and gamblers and prostitutes and everything else had don't the street amen sit in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus are you ready for this and can feel the inspiration of the spirit amen rise you to a place Till You Lose Yourself amen till you lose yourself and scream out amen hallelujah praises to God that's a wonderful thing can I ask youall something if that's a wonderful thing why have we made it such a negative thing why have we made it such a embarrassing thing why they made it such a bad thing we need to lose ourselves church until the spirit of God can find a right away in the church and can raise us to a place Hallelujah come on we need to lose ourselves we need to lose our ideas we need to lose our feelings we need to lose oursel until the word can move in and let the word move you up somebody said one time said well preacher amen you're just preaching that message and working everybody up I said no you got it wrong ain't working it up God sent it down there's a big difference in working something up and God sending something downall well Glory Glory Glory come on Lose Yourself one time just try it just try it one time just forget about who sitting next to you and forget about who's looking at you and forget about what somebody thinks about you and just Lose Yourself one time and say amen hallelujah praise God that's good preacher that's the message of that Lose Yourself until you break out of Earthly places and you get back in Heavenly places you're not a chicken you're an eagle Hallelujah you don't belong in the Barnard you belong in the heavenlies you belong Where Eagles Fly come on sometimes oh sometimes you might have to get some Elbow Room I know it's a little hard this morning with a church full but you might have to say give me some Elbow Room I'm going to enjoy church I'm going to enjoy the word I'm going to enjoy the blessings I'm going to enjoy the anointing I'm going to enjoy the singing I'm going to quit looking at the clock well Glory Glory Glory I'm going to quit wondering how many pages the preacher God I'm going to enjoy myself in the house of God hallu Lose Yourself he said identified word is back in our midst listen Lose Yourself and enjoy the inspiration of the word of God Amen the word of God is inspired all of it's inspired now I'm G to say this to you R tells a story about a woman fell sick her son was away in Cemetery I mean Seminary so they send a note to the boy and say you better get home your mom is going to die well he can't get there in time now watch this remember said his mother was going to die he said he was trying to get home he said but he couldn't get there in time he said now watch he said but when he come home she was sitting there well he said he walked in he said Mom they told me you was going to die she said well honey there was some Believers come down here from the local Full Gospel Church and they prayed according to Mark 16 now brother B said this he said the son looked at him and said well you see in the Seminary we learned that Mark 16 from the ninth verse on is uninspired she said Glory Hallelujah she lost herself she didn't care what her son thought about her she didn't care what Society thought about listen if you ever get as low as she was and God does something for you like he did for her you'll forget about who's looking at you you'll forget about your position in the church you'll forget about what Society thinks about you you'll lose all your prestige you know what I found I'm just going to say it I'm just going to let it out you know what I found I found sometimes that some of the greatest praisers you got in the church are the most Warrior people you got in the church they've been through more than you could calculate in your mind they've been through more troubles and disappointments and let downs and here's the miracle after everything they've been through they still got their praise after every situation they still got their praise after every bad day they still got their praise I was over I was over in England one time preaching for brother Crosby brother brother brother uh brother Crosby there in Lester England and there was a couple sitting on the front row brother sister Taffy is their name brother brother sister Taffy Elders in the church sister Taffy she probably I don't know she's probably 75 80 I don't know how old she is she's she's just a pillar in the house of God just a a prayer Warrior well I was preaching while I preach amen it' be real quiet you know and I'd say something she'd stand up she'd say hallelujah and then she'd do this little walk brother Wade you know up the pull pit and she'd put her hand up and she'd shake my hand you know and she' turn around she'd go back and sit down she' get her Bible back out she'd sit there for a few minutes and I'd get to preach and you know and the church be on fire and I'd hit a point and she'd stand up right against you go Hallelujah walk up there and shake my hand so after service I said brother brother Crosby I got to know her story he said brother Andrew he said she used to never act like like that he said she used to come to church and just sit there in a in that quiet formal mode he said but one day she got in a car wreck and she about died and he said God come on the scene and healed her and brought her back to life he said now we cannot contain her in the house of God come on Church listen if you won't praise him he'll get the rocks to praise him if you won't bless his name he'll get the rocks to bless his name but God forbid there ever come a time that a rock has to take our place may we lose ourselves and say God I thank you for everything that you brought me through I thank you for every trial I thank you for every Victory I thank you Lord she said Glory Hallelujah he said mother you're beginning to act like those people said now listen son looked at his mother and said mama said Mark 16's not inspired he said mother why you begin to act like that she saidwell son I just got to thinking if God could heal me with that which is uninspired he said then what could he do with that which is really [Music] inspiring I'm talking about see and a prophet comes along and says Mark 16 is just as inspired as John 3:16 sir amen see what I'm getting at church is this in the last days Satan is going to begin to blow his foul and P poisonous breath I don't have time to read it to you but I'm going to say this and I'm going to tie this together whenever Satan blows on something he's trying to sink it he blew on the disciples he blew on the ship he was trying to sink it but can I turn that and say whenever God breathes or blows up on something he's trying to raise it now what happens in the natural happens in the spiritual you ever heard of something called the Clean Air Act yeah the Clean Air Act you know before the Clean Air Act nobody cared anything about how long your exhaust was on your truck you know what I'm talking about brother you go in a building and you weren't worried about the smoke and the smell and but after the Clean Air Act what it was was United States primary Federal air quality law intended to reduce and control air population Nationwide now This Clean Air Act because you got to breathe right you got to breathe so the Act was to improve and to strengthen and to accelerate programs for the prevention and the abandonment of air pollution so the whole reason they come up with this Clean Air Act was to improve the air quality so when you went in a place or you were somewhere you had a right by the Clean Air Act to breathe clean air without pollution I got to think about that brother Wade and I looked it up do you know when that act was initially enacted in 1963 Amen in 1963 in the natural they're already thinking if People's going to survive if they're going to live we got to clean up the air we got to get all the pollution out can I say this at the same time the America government is establishing a Clean Air Act amen a prophet is standing on the earth and he's opening up the word in the church at the same time they're cleaning the air up in the restaurants they're cleaning the air up in Airplane they're cleaning the air up everywhere a prophet is standing in the pull pit and he's opened the word and you know what he's doing by the opening of the word he's improving the air quality in the church in other words we now have a filter listen for years it was full of pollution it was full of three gods and woman preachers and tongues is the evidence and false gifts and false interpretation but when a prophet stood there and begin to preach the open of the word it brought a filter in the church and the message removed the pollution from the church listen friends Amen in the days of the son of man being revealed it would be a day of pollution it would be moral immoral amen pollution just the same way but listen the message would seem to be the world of fanaticism but the Holy Ghost would come down in the church and the pollution would go out and there would be clean air returned among the church where the bride could breathe clean air again so now you don't have to intake and just intake pollution intake pollution intake pollution but now there's a filter in the house of God the church can breathe again come on Church you know what I'm talking about I'm talking about you can come to church and you don't have to worry about not saying amen or should I agree with that or should I agree with this amen if they're preaching the message amen it's an air filter in the church and if it's the message you got a right to breathe it in if it's the message you got a right to agree with it I may say well brother andyw you're getting a little strong on that message you're exactly right because it's the filter of the church now let me say this to you when God breathes on something he's going to raise it John 20:22 the Bible said when he had said this he breathed on them and said receive ye the holy ghost look at this breathe it is to blow or breathe upon where Jesus after the manner of the Hebrew prophets expressed by the symbolic Act of breathing upon the apostles the communication of the power of the Holy Spirit to them this word used only once by the translators in Genesis 2:7 where God breathed on Adam and he became a living Soul now can I can I close on this point just as the original creation was completed right by an act of God so the new creation was complete completed by an act from the head of the New Creation in other words in the first creation he completed it by breathing upon Adam and he became a living soul but here the Bible says in the new creation the head of the new creation will once again breathe upon that creation and that will be the completion of that creation but said listen he's creating his own bride justification of Luther sanctification of Wesley see the evolution of a spirit being given more and more because the body is building amen coming to the head which is Christ the body of Christ another place then a new creation not to denomination but to the word you are a creation of the word remember said see in the church age book what is it it's the creation of God can I say this to you and I'm done now the breath and the spirit has become the same in The Bride come on church when God breathed upon Adam he put Authority Adam and Adam could say son stand still he could say tree uproot and go here he could say line calm down he could say wind calm down he can say when pick up are you hearing me in the last days there will be a second Eve who is married to the second Adam and the part of God said now the breath and the spirit has become the same she is uniting together bringing forth that same powerful blow of the Holy Ghost like he did back there and is manifesting the same works that it back there is being manifested right here today in you somebody's got to breathe again somebody's got to breathe again can these bones live again there's a valley of dry bones can they live again Lord can they live against son of man now knowest what are you going to do he said prophesy son of man he said so I prophesied as I was commanded and as I prophesied there was a noise and behold a shaking and the bones came together now watch this if you got a valley of dry bones and they've been there for all these years right now listen you got Jim's bones and John's bones right you got Jim and John's bones amen and now Jim's got a leg bone and John's got a backbone the Bible does not say when the Ezekiel blew across the bones that the bone come to Bone but this was a this was an original restoration the Bible says that bone came to his bone so Jim didn't get John's backbone and John didn't get Jim's leg bone but Jim got Jim's backbone and John got John's leg bone thisen what the prop of God said he said prophesy can these bones live amen now watch what's the four stage of that coming forth of the church what's the four stages of ezekiel's dry bones coming forth but the life only not when the sen you was on them but when the wind blowed upon them that's when it come back the fourth message of life I love what he says the pyramid will stand again the house of God will live again what are you saying preacher I'm saying the restoration is the appearing of the Lord yes preparing the church for the Rapture look at somebody say you got to stay alive got to stay alive sister Jun we got to stay alive no matter what the future holds we got to stay alive no matter what comes we got to stay alive brother wait no matter what tomorrow holds we got to stay alive Nate hey are you hearing me spoken word you got to stay alive and there's only one way to stay alive and that's God's provided way and that is to breathe let our musicians come this morning 1 Thessalonians 4:17 then we which are alive and remain shall be called up together with him in the in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air now watch this so shall we ever be with the Lord look at this word alive to be in full Vigor yes right to be fresh come on to be strong yes to be efficient to be active to be powerful Amen in other words on the morning of the Rapture there will not be a St bride she will not be sour she will not be decayed she will not be diluted she will not be powerless she will not be inactive she will not be sleeping in church should not be wondering how many more services we're going to have a year in a month brother I tell you one thing I think just I just think three services a week's okay we going to have all these meetings and all this oh he might as well preach for here come on Church amazing me people complain about having meetings but they

ever hear the word of budget go ahead so because you don't want to oh God so because you don't want to spend the money and it very well may be you don't have it and there's no problem with that but

what you can go to support what you can love God enjoy the message get rid of the stress said like this he said this preacher came to himself speaking of Jonah now God had to provide a way for him to stay alive he said now here's what he done he said some oxygen came into that well and he just breathed normally for three days and took a nice little rest and ride so he could take this 40 days journey across the wicked City down there to preach the gospel and got all freshened up with some new oxygen Out of Heaven it couldn't come out whale it couldn't come out of the sea so it had to come

thing that fixes a misunderstanding is an understanding can I share this with you y'all remember brother Brandon we we quote it brother way we quote it by heart House of Hell give way to the name of Jesus y'all remember that remember that you know what brother BR said he said now them people was in prison right they were in they were in bars and he said they they said they come to him and said brother help these people you know what he said they misunderstood you they misunderstood him and the misunderstanding had put them in a prison and the only one that could break the prison was the one they misunderstood now in other words if me and Nate has a misunderstanding and it puts me in a prison I don't want to fellowship with Nate I don't want to talk to him I don't want to see him listen I cannot go to Wade and get the misunder understanding fixed I've got to go to the one that I misunderstood and I've got to let there come a humility and an agreement and an understanding come and then brother BR said now look he turned and said House of Hell give away and the one that they misunderstood was the one that spoke the word that tore the prison walls down brother Andrew why' you say that because there's going to be times that somebody's going to say or do something or act a certain way and you're going to misunderstand them and if you're not careful it'll put you in prison and you'll let that prison enable them rather hinder them from helping you but if you can go to the person and say brother sister I want to get this fixed maybe getting a little house cleaning here today but I

some flu clogged up and he didn't lose a Salvation the prophet said he just lost the joy of it right and I was thinking while our brother was preaching there's there's a wonderful air conditioner it's blowing air through here and you're breathing but there's got to be something called a return right there's a return over there there's a return over there it's returning all that bad air it's taking it up so we need as as we were singing this song I was thinking well that's what that's what David was doing he said return amen refreshing my air make me fresh Lord amen cuz without listen without those returns it would have got so stale in here after about 30 minutes brother Aaron know that a returns as important as a as when you where you put them as it is uh as it is the air conditioner cuz it keeps the air flowing well return unto us Lord the joy of our Salvation we believe in a return Ministry I believe it's going on right now and brother Ram's going to step right back into it amen amen I believe in return Ministry I believe brother Brown's going to come back but I believe so is Paul so is irenius so is Martin so is Luther and all the people underneath them they're all coming back brother Tatum all the ones that have passed on in this church they're all coming back I believe in that return Ministry I sure do amen but I don't believe we need him to come back here to tell us how to get there he's already told us and what he's already told us is going to bring him here and then we can enjoy that for 30 40 days ever how long I it don't matter to me and then we're going home and you know what we're going to breathe some air that that's just going to you not be able to you there's no way there's no way that you can explain it there's no way you can explain Heaven there's no way you can explain right now we have aches and pains we have things we got to do and we got Wayward loved ones think about a day when all that just sheds away think about when all that you can't think of it cuz we're still human but we we do as brother Andrew said we believe that God's already said it put it in the word the word's already said it we which are alive and remain so as I was telling you y'all the other day we're not looking for a [Music] Rapture no we got to have a body change first we which are alive in remain shall not prevent those which are asleep for the Trumpet Of God shall sound and they're going to come back here and take a body change then we're going to go in Resurrection cuz we're all going to go so I'm looking for God to change this vile body amen and it gets more vile as the years get longer and I promise you if God brother Andrew would be 28 and about another month God teares another 10 years he won't be preaching like that he'll be paining himself a little bit more let's give our brother a big hand thank God for these young on they can stand that and do it and he's got a uh brother Nate's got to get out of here so they he's going to back go back and preach at his church in in rton and and brother Andrew's got a head to Alabama for some unknown reason why would you go to Alabama but he's going to go with brother Homer and preach for him
