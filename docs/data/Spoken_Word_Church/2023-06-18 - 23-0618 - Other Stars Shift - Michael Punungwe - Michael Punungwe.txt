========================================

verse 13. let's pull it up all right all right so our heads for Louis thank you for all your presence here Lord thank you for allowing us to come to the house with Believers Lord to just join our faith together Lord and to Worship You Lord learn more about your word Lord just honor our faith Lord as we know you will as you're your good father take care of us Lord and reveal things to us Lord and help us in our daily lives Lord forgive us of all things Lord and pray for the service going forward and your personality Jesus Christ that prayer amen amen so downstairs I've just been talking about the absolute so I think I'll just continue to talk about that here in Matthew chapter 16 verse 13. it says when Jesus came into the coast of caesarea Philippi he asked his disciples saying whom do men say that I the son of man am and they said some say thou art John the Baptist some Elias others Jeremiah's or one of the prophets and he saith unto them but whom say ye that I am Simon Peter answered and said Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God now he asks he asked them who who are people saying what are people saying and of course today we know people have many opinions and many things to say and but then he asked who do you say that I am and then Peter says Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God and and that distinction is so important because Peter didn't just say well I believe everything you say Lord or I believe what you say or or certain thing because there's many people who believe what Jesus says even um the Muslims believe and things used as preachers they believe he's a prophet you know like it says here right here the John John the Baptist Elias Jeremiah is one of the prophets the Muslim belief he's a prophet the Muslim even believe in the miracle birth the Virgin birth but they do not believe that he was God in flesh and and that's the distinction where that's where all the power is lost they've missed that distinction they believe all they believe so far they don't have the Revelation and that's why in verse 17 says Jesus answered and said unto him blessed art thousand and brought join them for Flesh and Blood hath not revealed it unto thee but thy father which is in heaven and then verse 18 says and I say also unto thee like Thou Art Peter and Upon This Rock I will build my church and the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against it so that is why the distinction of who he is is so important because flesh and blood cannot reveal this unto us that's why the Muslims you know they believe what Jesus says but they don't believe he was the Christ because they they just look at him and they see flesh and blood they don't see God in flesh so they just need to they don't make that distinction and that's why Jesus is this is that's the rock the revelation of who he is is the rock that the church is built upon because that that's where all the power is that's how we that's where our healing is our Salvation every all the benefits that we need to get out of the word that's where those things are is knowing that he came down God himself came down the Flesh and died for our sins because if he's not God and he didn't die for our sins then we have no hope that's why the Muslims they believe that that's why they're so religious in their works you know Muslims they pray like five times five seven times a day they need they say you have to go to the mecca you have to walk around the mecca you have to go here you have to do this you have to have a prayer mat and you have to there's all this whole setup because they don't believe he was the Christ they don't believe there was a sacrifice and that's the problem because they believe he was just a man and he was a good prophet and a good teacher and all he said a lot of good things and you know love your neighbor don't steal be kind but they don't see that he was God and flesh and that's where the power is it's knowing who he is it's knowing that he is the Christ the son of the Living God as the scripture says and as the Revelation that Peter received and I'll read some quotes here from the absolute or brother Brandon was saying he's also like the North Star to a man that is lost he says now I hunt worldwide and I've been in the wilderness and sometimes one of the best if you look if you can look up you know the direction of the North Star he guide you out and the man that see man at Sea when he was lost and he can only find the North Star he can direct himself then the way he's going now that's when he's lost he looks for the North Star now other stars shift but that North Star sits right in the center of the Earth now I've been teaching on my Sunday school that you know we all need to have a compass and and even talks about here how accomplish is going to point to the North Star because the North Star is the the stable star the star that doesn't move other stars shift as brother Branham says the North Star stays where it is so if your compass is aligned to the North Star then you know where to go you're not going to be lost now the compass for us is our Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost is our Compass so it's going to lead us it's always going to lead us to the North Star if you're not leading to the North Star then you're going to be lost your compass is off there's many people in the world who have very many different compasses who like like say a businessman his Compass might be how much money can you make and and that Compass is going to lead him to make a certain deal or or an athlete might say well how can I get better at the game and then the sport I'm playing well then their Compass is going to lead them to be in the gym three times a day or or whatever your compass is you know it's going to lead you that way so if your compass is the Holy Ghost it's always going to point to the North Star which is God's word and that's what you're never going to get lost you're not going to deviate off the path you're going to know where you're going yeah and the North Star the interesting thing about um the North Star is that as as a as an indicator you know it's not just that the North Star points to the North Star but once you find North then you can see east west south so you can see all the different ways that your life could have gone you can see you know you see the North Star and that's where you're going but you can see the west and you can see that path or that path I could have went on you know if I had stayed in school and maybe let me become this and or maybe if I you know got that scholarship and went to the league or whatever whatever uh you know whatever your path could have been whatever you were doing and see the other path and you don't know where you and you can see the north path you can see the other paths and and you can see kind of see where they start out and you don't know where they go to but you can see you can wonder what what would happen if I went down that path and the truth is you don't know it would happen but all you know is that you'd be lost and you wouldn't be going the right way so thankfully we have a North star pointing us to the right direction and and that's where the branch says other stars shift so we need to keep our eyes in the North Star because it's not going to shift it's not going to you know it's a reliable if I point maybe to Jupiter or to the to a different star or whatever the case can be different constellation you know the next night it might be it might be here and then the next night it's over here but the North Star is going to be there and no the next night's going to be there if not or that's going to be there and yesterday today forever so it's just going to be right there it's going to be straight it's going to be narrow it's not going to move and brother Brandon goes on to say no matter where the Earth is turning the North Star Remains the Same it points towards the north that's the only true star I understand that we have that we have is that extremely North Star now it gives you your direction and that's what Christ is is to you if you want to go to heaven you want to be saved you want to be filled with the spirit you want to be Christ like Christ is your North Star if you're lost don't try to take a Creed here's your North Star here's your way here's your direction then if you take him as your North Star then that absolutely places the Holy Spirit your compass amen the holy spirit is accomplished and the compass will only point to the north star and if you got the baptism of the Holy Ghost it can only point to Christ and Christ is the word that's the way you find your way back so new Compass if it's aligned correctly it'll always point to the North Star everything you need is in the scriptures you know God's word is perfect and and you need to know who he is and that Revelation is so important it's who he is and I even talked to a Sunday school about how you know sometimes we look for all these signs and wonders and speaking in tongues and shouting and rejoicing and all those things are great but truly what is Supernatural is the fact that you've come to a revelation of who Jesus Christ is because that's what the whole Bible is is based on you know because many people like the Muslims they have there you know there's plenty nice people and and they're very sincere and they worship and they do what they're supposed to do but they don't know who he is you know and they're doing all these works but it's in vain because they don't know they don't know who he is like there was a sacrifice that you know these works this could do this works but we had a sacrifice that you know if we if we fail to these words which we will uh you know we have Grace there's a sacrifice for us made so that you know when we we come to the Judgment we come to these things when God is looking at us he doesn't see us he sees the sacrifice he sees the lamb slain she's our sacrifice so it doesn't matter what we look like it doesn't matter what you know we do what we've done in our lives what we think but if we hold on to that sacrifice then everything else is in the clear and brother Brown says this is a long way getting around what I want to say but you'll understand it maybe what I'm trying to get to you there must be an absolute in your life you've got to have it somewhere every one of you has got one you can't go on without one you've got to have an absolute so you're absolute you know we're put on this Earth to have relationship with God and and to worship and to serve him but if your absolute is turned a different way then it's going to lead you to serve that thing or whatever the absolute may be and that's when that's why you need to have the compass the compass is the Holy Ghost and and you know if you have the revelation of who he is and then you can personally get to know him then that comment is always going to point you to the North Star you're never going to have to um you know wonder what's going on or why things happen but you just know that God's got it all in control and that you can just trust him and and keep following him in that way so yeah but if your absolute isn't Christ and that's why people sometimes they get caught up in these different denominations different ideas you know different principles because they don't have the compass in their life to tell them that well this brother you know brother Branham would say um he was being kind but he would he would go places and he knew that didn't agree with everything he said would you say you know if you don't agree with everything I say just sit listen and it's like eating a cherry pie you know you get to a seed you just spit it out but you keep eating the rest of the pie and uh sometimes you go to other churches and sometimes there's things they might not teach right but if you're the Holy Ghost you know you can you can have that discernment of the Holy Ghost and say well no this thing might be not be right you just you just kind of spot you know spit out the seed and then just keep eating the pie so you can you can have your own discernment but if you don't have the Holy Ghost you don't have that discernment you may go somewhere and you may be deceived and not even know it and thankfully we're elected so we have that promise that you know if we cannot be deceived that way and brother Brown was going to say there was a time there was a time when a woman her word about table manners that was the absolute in America I think her name was Emily post if I'm not mistaken and whatever she said about table manners if she said you should be with your you know eat with a pass or a knife or that was it that was it and why if she said to eat the chicken you just picked it up in your hands and eat it no matter how anybody looked at you you were exactly in line see because that was the absolute she was the absolute of table manners that's right whatever the woman said that was it so so the similar to God you know we God is our absolute so whatever our whatever our mannerisms are to be whatever our our demeanors are to be whatever our lives are to be um it is to be tailored by God it is to be you know checked out and filtered through the Holy Spirit so so similar like you know even if things itself this woman just said you know you know we're supposed to eat uh supposed to eat I'm a pudding with a fork then those and then you might seem odd to you but that's what she said so that that's what that's how what it goes and um not similar to God you know there might be things that you know when you read the scriptures you think man like that just seems so so hard for for God to do that or maybe it seems like oh well you know I wish these type of people get into heaven or these other people were like you know or whatever happens or even if say maybe you think oh drinking's not that bad or this isn't that bad but you have to have a a compass a holy spirit that will tell you well you know what even if I don't think it's that bad even if I think having a little fun on the weekend isn't bad thing the word says something differently so I need to follow that even if I disagree with the word and always stick to the truth no matter what so that's why we need to follow our absolute and whatever he says goes and the scripture is on to say but you see all those with the wrong kind of real absolutes they failed every one of them standing in Egypt not long ago I was thinking about the time that Pharaoh set on the throne and you know you have to dig down 20 feet in the ground to find where their Throne was oh my oh an absolute that would be it's perished and gone and the people that relied upon that kind of an absolute they're perished with it so where your absolute goals that's where you go you know if you're absolute is to perish then you are to perish but if your absolute is eternal and everlasting then you are to be Eternal and everlasting so you must follow your absolute and he says why it was man-made anything that's man-made will perish with man but there is an absolute that cannot perish there's the Eternal Word of God it can never perish and you must stay with it we have an absolute at a ball game you know that we have a ball game can operate without an absolute and that's the Umpire see now sometimes we don't like his decisions but it's absolute she's the absolute anyhow no matter if we if we want to say other than that you know or there was a strike there was a ball he says strike that's what it is don't argue with him he's there he's the absolute in the ball game because if he said strike you can fuss you can throw your hat out there and protest it but it's a strike anyhow amen now let's just take a minute what what if there was no umpire in the game what kind of a fuss it would be it would be chaos you couldn't play the game without having an absolute in it games have got to happen absolute so every every game you play has a rule book it's a rule set and and you could consider Life a game and if that's the case then then God has the rule book and we need to follow that the Bible is the rule book it lays out the the laws for us what we need to do and how do we we come to you know Salvation and New Birth and having experience and we can't just can't just be you know playing our own game and trying to play our own rules because then we're not gonna be able to play at all yeah he just goes on to say you know talk about how and that's why the the revelation of who he is is so important because like I said the Muslims believe but they don't know who he is and knowing who he is and knowing that okay this is this is real something about this is real because you know Flesh and Blood can't reveal this to us you know it's it's not it's not uh any man can tell you anything but it's it's it's the Revelation that you get you know it's it's the man being used through through God so you can go to Revelation even the Bible says you know you can't even say that the Lord is Christ without even you know the Holy Ghost being a part of that and truthfully believe that in your heart you can't even confess that out loud truly and truly believe it without it being you know the revelation of the Holy Ghost and that's why you know if he's so adamant on Jesus is so adamant on you know that's why you bless Simon because flesh and blood is not flesh and blood that reveal this to you my Father in Heaven revealed this to you and similar to that you know there's just so many things where where even just in our personal lives we need to to yield to God more because you know things will be will come out the right way even in the way we treat each other even the way we raise our kids even the way we we talk to people even talk to people who aren't Christian and people talk to people we disagree with you know it's just a labor of love and knowing that you know what would you like even asking the question what would Jesus do or what would you know what would my absolute do in this situation you know what what am I to do because we're supposed to model ourselves after him and he's perfect so what are we supposed to be right exactly and and just to be sincere but also to know that you know to go back to the word every time because there's many people who they'll be very sincere but they won't they don't have the the new birth they don't have the revelation of who he is you know and they'll have their own experience and they'll think oh I have this this gift or this that and they'll think they're being led of God but but they go in the Bible and it's completely contrary so it's like what is their absolute you know what what what is leading them to this conclusion so these types of things is why just to get to to know the person as a as a person and even how the Bible talks about just getting to know his face and to see his face and to truly you know just to get closer to him and then even you know David always talks about how he wants to inquiring the Temple of the Lord or behold his face and just to and to just to be in the presence of the Lord because that's how you see someone's face you know like we have to we have to get closer because there's no when these things are being explained in the Bible there's no face time there's no Skype we can't you know but so see someone's face you have to be in their presence you have to go where they are and be there you know and truly be in their atmosphere and to be in the right atmosphere so it's all those things and um as the musicians come and said there is no scripture in the Bible that say there's no promise that says the Bible said God God is in the word right God is in the word God the word is true and I've seen in there the Bible where it said whosoever shall add one word to it or take one word from it shall be taken his part out of The Book of Life now I know that was an absolute that word could not change so I accepted that I said now Lord let me hide let me hide it into my heart that it'll keep it and be reverent with it and whatever it is I'll walk with you guide me and that's and it's been my absolute so just to know you know for a fact that the word is right and that we need to always follow the word and be with us because you can't add one word or take take a word away because that's how we get in trouble so it has to be it has to be absolute every word every line and we have to you know have the Holy Spirit to discern these things the people can read the Bible and there's many people who have read the Bible more than us multiple times over and they still haven't caught the Revelation really of what it's saying they haven't caught the Revelation that a man came and God came and a man and died for us and to catch that Revelation and to have that in your life and then you know and they try to follow the word but it's it's always odd because they'll you know and even the way talks about the splits and the Methodist Church and the women preaching and homosexuals preaching and all those things and it's because they're they've taken they've taken the words away and they've added words to it and that's how we get off is when we're not just following what God has provided for us so let's all all of God provided for us and God bless you [Applause] [Music] [Applause]
