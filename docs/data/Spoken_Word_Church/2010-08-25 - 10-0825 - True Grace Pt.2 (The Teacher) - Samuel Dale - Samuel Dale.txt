because we want to stand complete in you and just guide us as we read your word have your way in jesus name amen titus 2 let's start with verse 1. but speak now the things which become sound doctrine now that's what i'm trying to do because now remember i told you that i was not dropping back after preaching the series of the second coming i was not dropping back i hope you'll understand these are the things that we're climbing higher into of the things that you know have already been spoken but yet we need a revelation all right but speak to other things which becomes sound doctrine that the aids men be sober grave temperate sound and faith and charity and patience the age women likewise that they be in behavior has become holiness not false accusers not given to much wine teachers of good things that they may teach the young women to be sober to love their husbands to love their children to be discreet chaste keepers at home good obedient to their own husbands that the word of god be not blasphemed young men likewise exhort to be sober minded and in all things show thyself a pattern of good works in doctrine showing uncorruptedness gravity sincerity sound speech that cannot be condemned and he that is of the contrary part may be ashamed having no evil thing to say of you cena this is getting down to speaking to somebody that's getting anchored real good right exhort servants to be obedient unto their own masters and to please them well in all things not answering again not for prolonging which is meaning really to steal or to divide you know like something like that or to be to embezzle is a word for prolonging so not prolonging but showing all good fidelity that they may adore all may adorn the doctrine of god our savior in all things now for the grace of god that bring us salvation hath appeared to all men true grace now true understanding teaching us that denying ungodliness and worldly lust we should live soberly righteously and godly in this present world looking for that blessed hope in the gracious appearing of the great god in our savior jesus christ who gave himself for us that he might redeem us from all iniquity and purify unto himself a peculiar people zealous of good works these things speak and exhort and rebuke with all authority let no man despise thee you may be seated the lord add his blessing to the reading of the word now we're going to try to speak on we're still on the subject that we were sunday afternoon and i just titled it there uh true grace you know to where we would have a title for the message and uh we're trying to go through a part and i want to carry that on tonight but we were covering now that true grace all right now grace is the hardest thing to preach to hold in the line of being correct throughout the word of god throughout the prophet's message throughout time throughout uh doings because uh grace i guess is one of the most uh talked about uh doctrines all right but it's also one of the most um used wrong you know and and all as to uh people use it to to you know um back up their own site things and doings and and uh you know but still that doesn't change it because we found out there in the scripture that you're saved by grace but there's more to go with it there in ephesians two right it says we're saved by grace through faith you say oh we're just saved by grace will everybody in the world now i hope you understood that sunday if you didn't hear it please listen to it the everybody in the world is saved today when jesus christ died at calvary brother brown said every person that was in the world was saved right now are you going to say he was wrong no no he was right because the scripture said i gave them to you that's what was preaching on sunday romans 6 and 10. that he died once for all he didn't die two times so there's not a grace that's for the bride a grace for the foolish virgins so we'd say you know just making categories you know a grace for the jews it was all done at calvary you know he didn't do a little extra for you and i he done it all account for it he paid the price and everybody in the world was saved that day but they wouldn't accept it right so we're going on what is true grace so what's the problem well brother dale i just don't understand how you could say everybody would say i didn't the bible says it and the prophet said it you argue with god about it he died once for all all right now if we if we don't accept it it can't be applied right right right now and we don't accept it right it's not for us so we're the one that determines it right yeah but i want to illustrate something to you but what i want to do is i want to read what i wrote down to you to work that let's get your mind into what i'm talking about so make sure you understand what i'm saying all right right now the bible says the prophet says that we're saved by grace amen and everybody in the world was saved at calvary amen but it cannot be applied because it won't accept it a pardon is not a pardon unless received is one we'll get to that in a minute right if you don't accept it it's not for you but see it's not a situation that you say well i didn't accept it but one of these days i want to accept it are you saying that he's going to have to go back to calvary pay the price for you to be able to send you grace no there's something wrong with your men lexi it's it's not that away but now listen well brother adam brother you ought to say it for myself make the statement but brother dale then if grace is unmerited favor and that's what it is right grace is not something that if you do anything and you think that that merits you anything then jesus christ didn't die for you if you think that you were so good what about the rich young ruler amen what about the rich young ruler standing there with the lord jesus have you done this have you done that he said i've done all these things i kept everything from my youth and you know what the bible said jesus loved him why because he knew he told the truth right he could look down through and see that he told the truth he loved him but see none of that saved him so he knew where his problem was so what'd he say and once if he said come follow me maybe the rich young ruler would have put all his money into the work and they would have had millions of dollars for great campaigns you know he might have done it but jesus knew where to hit him he didn't ask him to give him all of his money he would have probably gave him a great offering because he knew to do those times he said go say what you got and give it to the poor didn't come and follow me so he knew exactly where he was at right he knew he wouldn't follow him because of that situation but now think about it do we really believe that grace is unmerited favor and if it is then why is not everybody in the world safe right i'm trying to get you to think it graces unmerited favor and you cannot do anything to merit it or it would not be grace why is it that everybody's not saved why is it that you know well the price is paid everything's done finished jesus died it's for everybody we just all go into heaven because we won't accept it right now that's hard to think it right i remember reading one time about a guy standing out on the street corner trying to and it's not this new fancy five dollar bill you got it's because it don't even look like play money to me but they still use it but i remember reading about a guy standing on the street corner trying to give away five dollar bills and he was just you know handling i want to give them to you you know what nobody wouldn't take one they thought there was some gimmick some thing you know that was trying to take place oh no we don't want to take that that might be counterfeit if i wind up with counterfeit you know but now think of the situation if grace is unmerited favor then why is it that all are not saved the price is paid everything was done but you see everybody won't accept it because of some reason some problems from something they won't accept it it's hard to tell the truth because there's so many perversions of truth until it's hard to really tell truth and get people to believe it right i'll get on to it in a few weeks or wherever when i can but the bible says we're just as perfect as god is but do we believe it oh yeah we can explain it but has it been revealed to us what that means i was asking terrence something coming down going down the road there the other day i asked my wife about it you know you you hear a lot of people preach about it that's fine i know it i know it's right but what does it mean when you say that if you think your brother has ought against you to go lay down your offering and don't try to offer it and go get it right what does that mean everybody's got a definition then but when brother branham was preaching to 300 ministers about the baptism in the name of the lord jesus christ and the biggest portion got up and walked out and those that didn't turn around and wouldn't even ever come and get baptized did he go to every one of them to try to get them all straightened out when he preached at the tabernacle or anywhere don't you know that there was a lot of people was offended at him a lot of people had ought against him did he go to them to straighten it i out i'm just serious i i like to see things you know to where i can understand it what does that scripture mean is it that if you tell somebody the truth and they get offended at you are you supposed to hunt them all over the world or try to straighten it up what does that mean well brought it to me no so you got your own self-interpreted answer and see i just gave you two or three illustrations and a lot more could be given to cover the point of do we know what that means or is it whatever our eyes see and we look at now i want to try to illustrate great sweetie i gave you a little picture then later on the picture they can see up there i'll hold it hoping it comes in those that are on internet we have a piece of paper with the letter g-o-d-i-s-n-o-w h-e-r-e all together okay dick put it up there we're gonna do it thank you okay now what does that mean see if you do it this way that's right it says god is nowhere i'll hold that up a little closer what i said that's just the way it looks you know which one are we looking at according to where you put the lines on the word well now brother dale it's not god is no where it's god is now here right you know i didn't change the letter that's right bring it over here where they see it all right he said god is now here right he said well what's that got to do with grace that's what i just asked you a simple question if grace is unmerited favor why is it that every person in the world will not be saved when the price was paid amen for it to be done right now we all baptist we had it figured out that it was called once saved always saved right once saved always saved right right huh we look down and say no that's not right but you tell me it's not right because if you're once saved you're always saved right right amen right now i didn't change the words right you see we think we know what we're talking about and then we condemn a lot of people for what they're saying when they come find out they're saying the same thing he says according to where they put in the line they have to divide the but if you're truly born again right and that's the only way you can ever be saved is to be born again right then you're always born again that's right but now then if you turn around and you say well then was the baptist right when they said once saved always saved okay now what do you mean that's right i heard your words i got the letters on the page i got it all figured out right but now what did you mean all right brother asked brother dick one night time like that i got some tickles cause he said i heard you but now what are you what are you saying that's right i know hey good point that's right see when you go to the end of the statement of once saved always saved and you say that i have received the baptism of the holy ghost and you birthed into my heart and i now have eternal life right and i can never be lost that's right well you know that's true that's right right but another person gets up and says but what i'm saying is once saved always saved it don't matter what i do i'm saved yeah you know they're quoting scriptures you know they're telling truth not the truth but they're telling truth because they're you say what well i'll just say the same thing you're saying no because you said it didn't make no difference what i'd done because now you've got from genesis to revelation to come back at you like i was trying to bring about sunday afternoon there on the message of grace but you can take it you can make it disgrace or you can make it true christ and it's all the only difference is a revelation right the only difference is the letters amen and where you know the divide to say god is now here right now you come to an understanding right why would god condemn a man if god was the one that said you're saved by grace right how can he be a just god and condemn someone when he said they're saved now are you thinking see true grace lord william we'll get that sunday and say well just little simple thoughts cause i'm trying to take them just a little you know alone and uh i want to ask you sunday just what he's saying well i got a blackboard coach but what he's seeing brother branham do you ever see him he said sin every day amen but then he could could have easily turned around and said show me where i've ever disbelieved the word right but you see i'm trying to get you to think about something do we understand grace we just understand the quotes the scriptures the the things how can it be that grace would be unmerited favor but yet you can grow in grace because that's what scripture says you can grow in grace and knowledge all right you see people will not accept the true understanding of grace because of the way they've been taught you know former background of teachings or maybe even because of a certain person saying it come on you know you've heard the story about the guy overseas his wife wrote him a letter sonny tell him honey i need some money send it to me now i'll tell you what so we finally decided i need to maybe let somebody else read the letter somebody else read the letter and what to say he said honey it's bad shape i need some money now he said she's changed her mind now i'll send it to him no same words it was his mind amen that's right now how many times have you read and swore that the bible says the correct way to baptize is the name of father son and holy ghost matthew 28 19 right baptized in the name of the father and of son of the holy cups right but then you come along and you finally catch the truth about it and you find out that nobody's ever baptized that away in the bible right right and it was never baptized that away until the catholic church come along and picked it up right and turned it there about 325 along in there and they begin to baptize in the name of the father and of the son of the holy ghost when nobody in the bible's ever baptized except in the name of the lord jesus christ we're going to have a baptism a couple of weekends so from now not this coming weekend probably the next one so if anybody wants to get baptized we're going to have a baptismal service now but you see people will say i'm saying just what the bible says it says repent every one of you and be baptized in the name of the father and the son and the holy god and you know we're saying verbatim what the word says but then we find out that nobody in the bible was ever baptized father son and holy god and until the catholic church come along and change it and we got documents right out of your own encyclopedias that you got in your home to show you where they changed it at and things like that but i'm not arguing with nobody about that i'm just trying to make a point right you see when you see it and you know the truth then and you get baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ because that's where they baptize in the name of the lord jesus or the name of jesus christ in the bible and you baptize in the name of the lord jesus christ what are you doing you're full of fulfilling exactly what matthew said that's right baptized in the name of the father and of the son of the holy ghost right father son holy god lord jesus christ right now you got it but if you got it like i heard some people one day talking and as a matter of fact it was a preacher preaching about it he said we take acts 2 38 for our baptism he said with them denominations they take matthew 28 19 for the urge and i sat there and thought how spiritually ignorant man are you matthew 28 19 is bible right acts 2 38 is bible right and you're saying that one of them is good and the other one ain't one's right nothing's wrong all right you get the background enough to know what i'm saying about grace amen what is grace well it's just american favor yeah and everybody in the world was saved at calvary if they'll accept it because a pardon is not a pardon and i didn't give these to you because anybody knows these but just a few goes with it that i want to read that what the prophet had to say about it this is off with a message here you him 1956 11. pardon is not a pardon if it's not received as a pardon and god's pardon and grace divine healing is the property of every believer if it's received is that but if it's turned down then it's of no effect god is not guilty because he offered it to you behold it greater than solomon is here 62 612. pardon is not a pardon unless it's accepted as a pardon so that's the way god's word is it's the word of god to all those who will accept it as the word of god if it's not well then it isn't right so if you accept it to be the word of god it's the word of god but if you think it was a man that wrote that and man did right right man pinned it down but he couldn't say anything other than what god said pardon in 1963 10 28 he talked about it god gives us all things and he gives us a pardon it's a pardon to those who want to accept god's word as a pardon put it on it just to read it just to read it it doesn't mean that you're pardoned it means that you've got to accept it as your pardon that god gave his son to die in your stead and then it's a pardon see so it's not a part yet the paper says pardoned you know but it's not unless you accept it release from guilt is what we wish to place on this or pardon from god is a release from guilt not that turning away by a psychological doctrine of some sort that might in some way give you a little feeling that you have done what's right by joining church or taking up some creed but it's a release from your guilt by the power of calvary something has released you there's no more guilt the bible said i believe in romans 5 1 there is therefore now no condemnation in them there and in christ jesus who walk after not after the flesh but after the spirit but you see then sunday i was trying to explain it that if you do get born again because you're saved by grace through faith the salvations of the lord jonah 2 and 9 oblivion but when you get saved that statements that i made will automatically do away with but it don't matter what i do right one when you get born again your christian journey is based upon you walking in god's word right now all right let's keep it straight if you're truly born again yes you are going to be saved right but if you're truly saved then why would you want to live like anything else other than being saved listening the other night brother brown said luther and talked about wesleyan all the images he said they all had a pentecostal experience they did sure did neutral spoken tongues i've done everything they ever born again believer that's ever been born again had a pentecostal experience right amen don't mess me a pentecostal i'll have you to know i'm right bless him well if you ever are what and will be can be someday will be whatever if you are five you are you have had a pentecostal experience that's right by the new birth amen because there's only one new birth right and that's the birth of the word amen so then if we don't accept the pardon what have we done we've turned the grace of god the scripture says into lasciviousness to believe a lie and be damned by it now that's scripture you see a pardon is not a pardon unless received is one now what i want you to see is one thing the only way that i can tie grace together i've got a lot of scriptures in here about grace and the things that it says you know but um the only way i tie all the bible together about grace is is one way grace is not a doctrine right he said well it's the oldest one has ever preached right because it wasn't started for the foundation world yes we know that but it's not a doctrine it's a person see that way it can fit all the bible grace is a person the person of the lord jesus christ that's why when you're born again you receive the new birth which is the life of christ and by receiving that new birth then is christ living in you but you see we think that we just get you know like the people said to run around we'll run around if i believed it that way i i just i just lived like that he said i live like i want to right now said i do people don't like you to make statements sometimes because they don't a lot of those out there don't understand you but you know i drink all the liquor i want you know what's so amazing i've been drinking when i was a sinner i don't want to drink it well you just never did drink it i'll agree with you i'm glad i did thank god for that point don't make me any different because it took just as much grace to save me as it does to save the dirty stinkiness person in the world that has ever been amen because we've got to go back to grace but if grace is a person that's revealed to you then how could we ever have any thought or concept in our mind why would we even in any mental form ever think of i can just go do what i want to any reason for that to be in your mind i'll tell you up front it sure ain't god all right so then there's one other guy talking and that's the devil so it's certainly not god telling you that all right see but we we get the idea and we can't straighten it out in our minds and that's where our trouble comes it we we we we get it all messed up and and and then the devil comes along says well what about this what about that well what about this and what about that and then you just you just your brain's gone why because you can't talk to the devil about a revelation that's right you got a whole lot more quotes than you got and a lot more talking to you you make it sound more beautiful but when you try to tell the devil that a grace is a person it's not a concept or a thought see he doesn't know what in the world you're talking about because he's built upon the fact like the pharisees paul said that he lived a perfect life under the law he did under the law paul was living a perfect life he didn't do what he's supposed to didn't do and he done what he's supposed to do and there was no condemnation but one day a person came present isn't that what paul says he said the things i've done i thought was right right he said i thought it was right because i followed what the word said he said one day the word came to me and i found out the things that i thought was right i count them down he's seen what was happening to mankind and try to explain it to us and show us what real true grace is well i got this quote here i got this quote sir okay amen but what about the rest of the message what about the rest of the bible you bring anything to me on grace while i'm into this you bring anything to me and show me where that i'm not bringing it correctly and if you can't then you need to shut your mouth and believe it and start practicing it you say well you shouldn't be that way why not i ain't mean you if you said that because if you're saying it right i ain't mean but now listen see then if it's unmerited favor why would the prophet talk about if you send us in as a christian you're going to rip the washed up for if it's just a license to do anything we want to do you know living life and we call it grace then what does the scripture say and it's over in the uh what where my notes really find it where is it i lost it somewhere somebody signed it for me where was it peter that said no no that's that's not what i'm getting at the one i'm getting is is worth you whatever you sow you're gonna reap right i'll find it turn a minute in the scripture but you know it's true and it was in the new testament under the disciples writings you said well brother dale that's what i understand you're explaining them perfectly explained i'm not perfect no i didn't say that where'd you get the idea i said that because the bible says that i'm perfect well i just can't believe i'm not perfect i'm forgiven well then we found out that if you're forgiven that means you was totally wiped out what you've done so you're not guilty you see have we been released from guilt by the revelation of grace or is it give us a book of rules to have to live by that's why i don't preach like these other preachers do and i'm sorry i know i'm just not a i'm not a good old-fashioned pastor i don't preach every service on women's dress and hiring clothes and men's hiring shorts and all this thing why because if you can't have a if you're a born-again christian you tell me where you can live any life outside of the life of christ with a born-again christian i'm going to tell you you're not born again now is that as blunt as i can be that's right if you think that it's anything you've done or didn't do that saves you you're lost because you're still in the trap of the devil right you turn the grace of god into lasciviousness when god has god revealed to you that you've been pardoned right hey man well then is he happening you're not pardoned right you mean i'm lost i didn't say it right why did you amen that's what people do you know you're talking to them about about the lord and the message of the hour or something they say you mean my mama wouldn't say well i don't doubt your mama she was a good person you must doubt it why don't you bring it up you got something a little click in your mind that maybe she wasn't saved because i didn't say she wouldn't because she was in a different time than what you're in that's right but has he revealed to you that you've been pardoned from your past sins but just remember don't ever think see and watch me going one way going right back the other one in a hurry oh but don't you ever think that you're pardoned from anything you could ever do right or ever will do now don't make god's grace a blanket that has thrown over something because it's what mankind does grace is a person and must be revealed listen to these you've heard the prophet say these things god keeps his word 57 407. he says you're going out and he said and you say lord i'm sorry said you're going to get a whipping fart in other words you've done something wrong and then you say well lord i'm sorry you see that's what we do with our kids though you know the kids go do something and you you know they learn real quickly say please or i'm sorry that's right they learn it because they know they're gonna use it and they go do something and you start to word them and they say i'm sorry right and you know they'll even get smart enough to be able to quote brother dale they'll say brother dale said if you ask for forgiveness you've got to forgive them and i ask you to forgive me i'm sorry now why you gonna do it because the next time they do it they're gonna say what i'm sorry and after a while they're gonna learn to say i wrote a note while ago i know i was gonna go do wrong and i wrote a note saying i'm sorry you said you can't do that now the catholics do it all the time come on i'm not throwing off on them because that's no difference but they do right they give you a right to go down and pay the priest for your sin you're going to commit before you commit them that's right what's that big old word for me but listen are we pardoned from what we do after we become a christian you know as i'm just asking this question after you become a christian are you pardoned does that pardon me and you can go out let's do whatever no supposing that the guy you know that brought random referred to that was the one you know where the the courts of supreme court said you know pardon not apart unless you receive this one so let's change the situation just a little bit and and the guy goes in and gives the man the pardon and he says hey that ain't official letterheads and papers but is it real yeah you can go you don't have to be shocked right i'm gonna carry this piece of paper with me and if i ever do that again i'm gonna pull the paper on you see he pardoned me now you know that wouldn't be right right you know that wouldn't do no good might get by the first time he's gonna get shot second time you know because you see being a christian don't give you a license to steal being a christian gives you a strict condemnation in your own heart and life for anything you would even think about doing amen do you think about it see here's where the true revelation comes in here's what i'm trying to talk to you about tonight because in titus 2 there we was reading and we got down to titus 2 and 12 and it says 11 and 12 says grace is a teacher now if it's a book of rules how can it be a teacher if it's a concept or a doctor or an idea how can it be a teacher is that what title said let's read it make sure nobody out there won't miss it what does he say for the grace of god that bringeth salvation has appeared to all men teaching us that denying ungodliness and worldly lust we should live soberly righteously and godly in this present world can you show me any word in the bible show it to me now and don't dare come up with some thought just put it out there i'm sorry maybe i shouldn't say that but show me anybody in the bible that ever got by with what they've done that's right well look what david done yeah and he faced it all of his life and was told that he could not even build god a house to dwell in because of the murder and the blood he had on his hands but did that lose him no he never lost his salvation no way because if you're truly born again you can't lose your salvation but why would the bible say that we're going to have to give an account of the deeds done in the body whether good or bad now that's not to watch on judgment that's the judgment indeed building the body where they're good or bad why would he put that there because we are but you know what you're doing you're like and i know a man sits up one time and i clicked and i knew it was a doctor and i went back and checked it and it's like i said i'm not throwing off on people now i'm just making statements and you go ask them i'll tell you the catholic church teaches you if you'll come to them we've got one sitting here among us that was formally that and should tell you in a hurry what i'm fixing to say is right that they'd teach you that all you've got to do is come and confess to them and you've done been out living in adultery you've been doing all kind of things but yet all you've got to do is go pay so much money and get to the right priest and that priest will take and he'll do certain things and he'll wave things over you and he'll turn around and he'll send you back out of there not only forgiven but he'll restore your virginity now that's not no hocus pocus ask them go very fine brother get you one thank you they think they have the right to restore the virginity that's how much power they think they have no girls boys you go out you live in adultery you get boys you get a girl pregnant you're gonna have to take care of that the rest your life girls you go out you get pregnant and things were and you have a baby you're gonna have to take care of the baby the rest of your life and every time you look at it the devil is gonna tell you you was told not to do that you was told not to do that you're gonna be tormented oh or we'll just go have it aborted then you'll be like brother random was dealing with that woman that time and that lady said she'd lay in her bed at night and hear that baby screaming screaming she what what brought him down i thought i'd forgive him there's where we use it for what we want man right here used to go to church here priest and said that if you've got the new birth that covers your marriage and divorce problem i differ publicly privately and all and don't agree with it because if that was true why would you have to have the grace of marriage and divorce to be given the last date by the prophet right right amen now if he was saying this that when your new birth is complete in christ and we walk out of here in a rapture there's not going to be any problems right but that evidently wasn't what he's talking about but that's just what i'm telling you people have an idea brother i thought you said for me to get the new birth did he just wipe off my slate clean he will and god but it won't clean the dirty garments that you and i live in we'll carry those things all over life we've got to pray out for forgiveness oh but god forgive me when i need to pray all right you know for sure then if you're lost if you don't think you need to pray i've made the statement and always misunderstood about it but i say it and i still believe it i drove a search guard all of my life and get down to the end of my life and him tell me he said you had it all the way down then to not search god and take somebody's idea or concept or a thought and think that i'm saved and never seek god again and wind up at the end of the road and find out i'm lost right i said well i just don't understand what you mean by that i don't understand why you can't understand what i mean that's right amen it's plain amen don't ever you don't you know brother dale don't play around with words you see grace is what's called us out of the world of sin and grace is what liberates us so it's got to be a person and it's got to be the holy ghost within you if the only teacher i know that we need is the holy ghost teacher well now what we don't we got to fight for i didn't say that because the holy ghost is the only teacher in the word right god put in a body a fifo ministry to help that and let the holy ghost have something to use see grace becomes a teacher to us to word it will deny ungodliness because grace is the baptism of the holy ghost made manifest in you and i as the person of jesus christ living in us right then i know he's not guilty right so the holy ghost then the scripture said is the teacher teaching us to deny godliness well it don't condemn me to go do that but then my brother brown said snakes don't have no hips either he said don't condemn me do that not cause you're lost amen if you can go out as a christian and do things and not be condemned you are lost is there anything else i can say amen well that's for everybody else listen the prophet said would you go out and everything like that even though you say i'm sorry he said you're going to get a weapon for it just remember that yes indeed you'll reap what you sow you read what you sow out either way they could put to come on yes sir but whatever you do take your whipping here take you with me what did the scripture say now if we won't suffer a chastisement we're what bastard and not children get right up and straighten up and say father here i am whip me just as thou seest fit lord here i am that's right and walk right back with a hallelujah on your heart god lets the whip down on you and what do you say god lets the whip down on you just say yes lord i deserve every bit of it just keep on going god will take you through all right it'll be over one of these days amen you mean you go do something wrong you can't run to god real quick and ask him to forgive you if you don't go to god and ask him to forgive you real quick you're lost it don't make no difference what you're doing if you're lost because the sinners condemned on a different level right general ain't going to hell because he sins you know some adulterous acts or something that's not even counted to a sinner we'll get to it right hebrews chapter 6 57 908 the evening service you say well can't we backslide absolutely and when you backslide you're going to get it don't you worry abraham got it and the rest of them got it and you will get it don't you think it gives you a right to sin it doesn't you'll pay for everything that you do you reap what you sow you do one little sin and you'll reap a whole worship fool that's right but brother don't don't listen but brother don't mean to say that you're lost that's exactly right abraham reaped what he sowed that's right but he was still saved if you're truly born again and you do something wrong immediately repent of it why wouldn't you but you're not lost you got caught in the devil's trap right and then one of us in here didn't get hadn't got caught in the devil trout and brother brandon was one admitted to him to start with he did listen what he said in hebrews chapter 7 59 9-15 now they get whippings for doing wrong you reap what you sow you get that don't think now you can't you can just go on out and sin get by with it if you do and got that attitude it shows you've never been you've never been born again say well brother dale i didn't believe you want to go now that he said but you get it if you've still got the desire in you to do the wrong then you're still wrong now i'm honest as a human being and i thought your prophet and i believe he was you mean the devil is not going to try to bring up what you've done and try to tempt you with the things you mean that even your prophet would say that the lord jesus could be tempted of women but yet he didn't see him right because you didn't fall into the temptation see for you to have a dirty thought it's not wrong because you cannot help what you think but for you to entertain that thought is where the wrong comes you get out here on the streets walk down the highway you go out here on the road or somewhere why did your prophet have a cross in his car now he said he did i didn't right he said he's seen women on the road he looked at the cross there's a man the devil contempting but it's not the problem of being tempted is when you yield to the temptation in other words you entertain it position in christ 1965 22 the morning service you might do things wrong and every time you do anything wrong you're going to get paid for it yes sir you'll reap what you sow but it has not one thing to do with your salvation when you're born to the spirit of god you've got eternal life and can no more die then god can die you're a part of god you're a son of god i was born to branham you might make me some other name some of the name but won't make me one less i'm still brown i was born branham always will be branham i may be so disfigured someday drawed with arthritis have a wreck and all torn up till i look an animal and i'm still grounded why brown's bloods inside are you listening why would we even consider that salvation as i said was like some form of a blanket it just falls over you that it just covers you you immediately start talking about sin what is the first thing you come to the human mind that's in this message the prophet said we're living under a bumper blood well i agree i agree we live it under a bumper bud i agree we finally found out which one of these batteries is running out toss that one you'll have to we knew one of them was going out but we didn't know which one so are we on that okay we got it all right but why would we even consider anything contrary than the fact of true repentance and a life lived in christ that'll do away with all of her hateful attitudes and arrogance and things and then you'll say i can't help it i'm born on that side you know what i started to do the other day i'm going to do it one day i thought about this i told parents about it going down the road you know one of these days i was born under nares and an aries does not like to tell people what to do if you think they do you're wrong you've missed the areas you're over on some of the side cause like i told rachel she said she's born under aries and i said yeah but i think you were born about a month early she don't get mad at she didn't know what all i was thinking about all this thing not about her about myself but you see well an aries is a person that tries to instruct not demand instruct a leo isn't one who demands or instructs by force i mean both of them are leaders and one will demand you do it the other one will say i'll just go show you how to do it and if you get out of the way i'll do it myself that's a true aries because you got to put that in there with christ and what all he was huh but you know what i thought i'd do one of these days i'm going to find out which is the worst of all the 12 signs and for one month i'm going to preach out of that sign i'm going to be exaggerating and hateful america you see where you already are i guess i'm you're right maybe i've been under them other 11 signs and you didn't know it but see don't blame it on signs well the devil made me do it he didn't do it you volunteered all right well i just can't help it that's what my brother said he's a methodist preacher he said he can't condemn me for being a sinner he made me a sinner i said no but you missed that one right because he didn't make you a center this is a 12th grade college graduate from a seminary i said you didn't do it you made yourself a sinner right god didn't have nothing to do with it he gave you a choice look what you've done but listen let me get on don't consider grace as a covering like a blanket that you'd think but we're we just all don't matter because we're under the bumper blood you know it's just all over everybody you know what you're doing you're turning the grace of god into lasciviousness because what you're doing is you're taking a truth and using it for your own benefit right you're using it for your own benefit sure we believe in a bumper blood we believe that if god was not looking down through the blood of jesus christ he'd have to destroy all of us right now yes sir really we believe it and who wouldn't want to be right but you know there's people i know one brother i won't call his name but he gave me a brand new pair of boots and two brand new shirts it cost about initially 30 years ago and then shirts cost me pr cost him about 50 space and you know what kind of shirts they wear but you know you know why give it to me because i proved he was wrong and he was in no way gonna say i'm sorry i should have asked him for a new cadillac all right listen i hope you're getting what i'm talking about right sure god does not see our sin as a christian or he would have to destroy us that's why we have to have the bible says an advocate now if you're not going to do wrong why have you got an advocate right right if you're not going to make mistakes in life why is there an advocate see then grace teaches us that we need to be called out of sin did you catch that grace teaches us that we need to be called out of sin grace teaches us we need to live right see then if we have any idea then it don't matter what i do i'm covered why would you want to live like that right why would you want to live that way you're gambling and brandon said i don't live true to my wife because she would divorce me he should be called i believe that if i told her that i'd done something wrong she would forgive me but he said how would i do it and what's what i wrote now this is the husband and wife so what's both of them heaven help the person who would think whether you are a wife or your husband and would think that your wife or your husband would forgive you for doing something and then you go do it don't tell me how dirty um david was but getting you rock killed to take a wife don't talk to me about that because that ain't half as dirty is to think that you can do something and get by with it why would you even think about it sure we all will slip and fall yes and we'll all make mistakes sure but we must ask for forgiveness if not we're going to answer for that well i've never heard anybody preach christ brother i always heard grace which is old and so wonderful to me no matter what i do everything's all right he's just a dodio granddaddy he's a god and savior just remember one thing for sure see i know it like this and this is the way i think why would you have such a bad ego that would make you think that you could do it something and get by with it now you tell me what else that'd be beside a bad ego and lost person you know you know a lot of you think i know i write funny notes okay and sometimes i get funny tickle about my own notes but you know what some of you think that you're so great at honcho macho this el chancho or what kind of a beautiful woman or what you are or what you do that you that your husband or wife can't live without you right just remember we can't live without god but he can live without us amen keep that in mind salvation does not give a right to sin salvation covers sin you know takes it away eradicates see the pardons only for what you have done it does not give you the right to go do it again i explained that a while ago now but brother dale that's not the way i see grace i think it's just a covering progress oh wonderful i just read what i wrote down and i say with all due respect to the fact that you can believe anything like that that you want to that would make grace not a teacher on the inside of you but the devil in you making you reject the truth so i want all the records clean folks i want all the record clean what about you come on brothers remember reap what you saw we used to teach that that didn't mean a christian you know that was somebody else well sorry we come to find out that that is about a christian and that we will reap what we saw all right if you don't think that we're ripping what was sold look what adam and eve sewed in the garden even with the beast and then with adam and look at what's taking place now there's nobody healthy nobody's in anymore everybody's dying it's all just just everything's just falling apart they're getting things now they don't even know what you got nothing for it why because we broke down the bloodline that's hard to think to tell a christian see that's what you people want you to tell them that you just get saved and everything's gonna be so wonderful oh it is it is so wonderful as a christian because you realize you have a savior but brother dale you mean i got to quit doing this i thought salvation was to take me to heaven i gotta quit cutting my hair wearing pants and paint my face and me with old lonely string hair you know my old garden you may not no no you don't have to quit nothing god ain't never asked nobody to quit anything i like that little thing that the little kids wear around their arm what would jesus do well what would he do if he's inside of you the same thing he done when he was here would jesus act like we do what is it then what is grace just unmerited favor but see then i do know that what i do or don't do don't have anything to do with it because he saved me because he promised him i took him at his word and accepted what he said so he saved me but now there's a condition in my heart to realize that i don't want to sin against my maker you remember the story was told who was it was it told of peter to where that he was going out of the city i believe that's right you know it's a story but was going out and as he was going out he met someone come walking back in who was it it was the lord jesus going back to die for him peter was going to run away but instead of that he just turned around went right back told them said don't even hang me the way they hung my master and hang me upside down because he knew what grace was grace is a person it's not a doctrine it's the person of jesus christ 174 174 in a red book anybody have a need now let us tell them all about is tell them all about our living in condemnation inside of us will you have problems and do something wrong yes siree call we're human but we won't justify them do you believe it true grace is not disgrace that's right the truth and all at once you are amen just think about him think about what he's done for you how he saved you how he's given us the truth you don't ever thank him for the truth don't ever just say lord thank you thank you for the truth and know how to live a man's ideas i don't have to worry about being up today and down tomorrow because of what somebody told me i'd go straight to you lord pour out my heart and say lord i'm sorry that i won't even think about what things so where he's broken is think about it talking about the lord thousands of yours we praise god praise god praise god praise god he's the only one that can make us perfect praise god god praise god praise god praise god praise god you know i remember when we was a kid that they taught us in school that they could travel into outer space and they would travel so fast you know when it's now taking place that you would be gone for hundreds of millions of light years you know and you're just way out you go way out and stay gone and hundreds of millions of light years and that's just light years that's not days and times he said when you come back to earth it's only just a few years older it's whatever time you travel well you know i was reading the other day something you know man with his technology he has been able to advance to go to that and travel way out and go and they got those things up there in space where they can just go up there and live and some of them stay up there six months and live there do you know what they're finding out now they say after you're in outer space for so long that the body begins to get to a place that it begins to age the muscle mass of things deteriorates and they're afraid now that those that have been out there for six months or something and they said as much as four months would do it that they're afraid if they came back to earth and they christ landed and the plane was on the rock it was on fire that they would not have enough energy you read about it they wouldn't have enough energy to walk away from the crash because their body had aged so much okay now i know the rest of the story they say after you're back here about three four days that your body begins to get back right but they're afraid if they christ landed they wouldn't be able to walk away from the plane because they've aged aged more than what you would be in here here you wouldn't have any trouble right but see we're not meant to be out there that's what i was thinking we wouldn't meant to be out there we're not going out there when it's all over god's coming right here we ain't got to travel all these things he's coming right here that's what i like about that little card god is now here he's down here father just be with the people on the way home give us all a safe journey that we may all be home safely and everything be taken care of we love you and we commit everything to you we pray that what we said tonight was worthy of being said about your grace because lord you are grace you are the person you're the only one that can keep off all of these kinds you shed the blood that would be able to cover us but one day that blood lord will be removed from that mercy seat and when it does only those who have the life of the mercy the blood inside of them will be protected we thank you father for your truth we love you we committed into your hands in jesus name amen you dismissed and when this battle's over
