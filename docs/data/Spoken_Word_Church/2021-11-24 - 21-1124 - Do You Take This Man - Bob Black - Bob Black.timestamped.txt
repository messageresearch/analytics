[6:47] [Music]
[6:51] amen
[6:53] you want to see him tonight you come
[6:54] expecting
[6:57] tonight i want to take a little topic
[6:59] from romans chapter 7.
[7:02] of verses 1 to 6.
[7:04] it's good to be in the house of the lord
[7:06] in the almost the middle of the week
[7:13] and
[7:15] since we're almost
[7:16] i we're almost at a thanksgiving i i've
[7:19] been meditating on a little a little uh
[7:21] sermon that brother brown preached and
[7:23] and then realized that he preached it at
[7:25] thanksgiving
[7:26] so it all it all kind of fits in
[7:28] together
[7:29] we've got a lot to be thankful for and i
[7:31] think one of the one of the most things
[7:33] that we've got to be thankful for is
[7:34] that we've heard a message that takes us
[7:36] straight to christ that we can look into
[7:38] the bible know what we're reading about
[7:41] right
[7:42] so let's read well before we read let's
[7:44] go to the author in prayer lord god
[7:46] we're so grateful to be able to gather
[7:48] around and and look into your word lord
[7:50] and and read the the things that have
[7:52] been written about you lord jesus and i
[7:54] pray god that lord that you'll just give
[7:56] our give our open our eyes of
[7:58] understanding tonight lord jesus and
[8:00] give us something to fight this battle
[8:01] with lord something to strengthen us
[8:03] with lord god that when we leave this
[8:04] place
[8:05] lord we'll we'll we'll know a little bit
[8:08] more about what we're doing here and
[8:09] where we're going and and and what our
[8:11] purpose is lord jesus and granted lord
[8:14] jesus said you'll just bless your people
[8:15] now as we read read your word be with us
[8:18] this after this tonight or we pray in
[8:20] the name of the lord jesus
[8:23] so romans chapter 7 says
[8:26] now now
[8:27] this is maybe a strange topic but i'm
[8:29] going to preach on do you take this man
[8:32] and you can continue the phrase do you
[8:34] take this man to be your lawfully wedded
[8:36] husband
[8:37] do you take this man
[8:39] and maybe just uh you know every every
[8:41] uh
[8:42] when there's a wedding ceremony
[8:43] conducted there's there's always a
[8:45] minister doing the the wedding and and
[8:48] maybe just kind of setting your mind uh
[8:50] thinking about a wedding ceremony
[8:52] tonight and romans chapter 7 verses 1 to
[8:55] 6 says know ye not brethren
[8:57] for i speak to them that know the law
[9:00] how that the law
[9:01] hath dominion over a man as long as he
[9:03] liveth as long as he lives
[9:06] but if he's dead then he's the law
[9:08] doesn't have dominion over him anymore
[9:11] for the woman which hath and husband is
[9:13] bound by the law to her husband so long
[9:15] as he liveth
[9:17] but if the husband be dead
[9:19] she's loosed from the law of her husband
[9:22] so then if while her husband liveth
[9:24] should be married to another man
[9:26] she shall be called an adulteress
[9:28] but if her husband be dead
[9:31] she's free from that law
[9:33] so that she is no adulteress though
[9:35] she'd be married
[9:36] to another man
[9:38] wherefore my brethren ye also are become
[9:42] dead
[9:42] to the law
[9:44] by the body of christ
[9:46] that ye should be married to another
[9:49] even to him who is raised from the dead
[9:53] that we should bring forth fruit unto
[9:55] god
[9:56] so who we're getting married to
[9:58] we're getting married to christ
[10:01] for when we were in the flesh the
[10:04] motions of sins
[10:06] which were by the law
[10:08] did work in our members to bring forth
[10:10] fruit unto death
[10:12] but now
[10:14] we are delivered from the law
[10:17] that being dead wherein we were held
[10:20] that we should serve in newness of
[10:22] spirit
[10:23] and not
[10:24] in the oldness of the letter you may be
[10:27] said to see to the lord that is blessing
[10:29] to the reading of the word
[10:33] now
[10:35] thinking of about thanksgiving and
[10:38] everything and you know thanksgiving
[10:39] started off with it
[10:42] it was kind of an institution that began
[10:44] with the pilgrim fathers coming over
[10:46] from the new world
[10:48] and
[10:49] the reason they came over was because
[10:51] they
[10:52] they they came from a front came from
[10:54] another land where that was restricting
[10:57] the way that they worshipped the
[10:59] the king of england would put in
[11:00] restrictions about how they could do
[11:02] things and and they were they began to
[11:04] be held accountable for treason and
[11:05] began to be accused of not worshiping
[11:08] right because of they didn't worship
[11:10] according to the way that the government
[11:11] wanted them to worship and so
[11:13] they got on some ships and they set sail
[11:15] for a new world
[11:17] and then you could think about all of
[11:18] the the travel and all of the
[11:21] seasickness and
[11:23] coming over to a new world and looking
[11:25] back and thinking i'm never going back
[11:28] and to them that world that they left
[11:30] was dead and they were they were never
[11:33] going back the people that they left the
[11:36] families that they left even if you if
[11:38] you wrote a letter you might never hear
[11:40] from the people again it might not even
[11:41] be a way to write a letter you couldn't
[11:43] make a phone call back then or get on
[11:45] the internet and send an email and so it
[11:48] was it was it was gone to them they were
[11:50] going to a new world
[11:54] and now brother branham said he said the
[11:55] pilgrim fathers were very thankful
[11:58] for their newfound way of life being
[12:01] separated from the old english
[12:03] denominations and creed
[12:05] and they could marry now think about
[12:07] this now
[12:08] the topic do you take this man they
[12:11] could marry
[12:12] to the new anointed word for their age
[12:15] because when they came over
[12:17] now they had liberty to worship in
[12:20] whatever way god wanted him to worship
[12:22] they could they were free you think
[12:24] think about the liberty that we have
[12:26] with the message that that there's no
[12:28] governing body over us there's no
[12:30] there's no somebody that we have to
[12:32] report to there's no gov there's nothing
[12:34] that dictates how we worship the only
[12:37] thing that dictates how we worship in
[12:39] the message is the guidance of the holy
[12:42] spirit we're under the freedom to
[12:44] worship and the way that god wants us to
[12:46] worship we don't have to report to
[12:48] nobody we don't have to give a report of
[12:50] this or that but we're under freedom we
[12:52] have the freedom like the pilgrims did
[12:54] when they left everything their old man
[12:57] was dead and they came to a new land
[13:00] to worship in the way that god wanted
[13:02] them to
[13:03] he said they can marry to the new
[13:05] anointed word for their age that's right
[13:07] the new anointed word of their age for
[13:10] their day so can we be thankful as
[13:13] pilgrims like abraham separated ourself
[13:16] from the things of the world all of our
[13:19] associates we've left it all behind it's
[13:22] all become dead to us everything our old
[13:25] way of life our old nature it's gone and
[13:29] now we can become married to christ and
[13:32] he said abraham was a pilgrim he said
[13:34] god has separated us all from the dead
[13:37] religions i'm speaking across the nation
[13:40] now all the dead creeds and to what
[13:43] separated us and opened to us a new land
[13:46] a new message for this day and he said
[13:49] they could marry that new anointed word
[13:52] and now we are at that same place where
[13:55] we can become united with that word now
[13:57] you think about a marriage ceremony you
[13:59] think about now when the minister's up
[14:01] there
[14:02] mary and the couple and the couple the
[14:04] groom and the the bride and the
[14:06] bridegroom they're up there and they're
[14:07] they're in a little doing the ceremony
[14:09] but there's a lot of things that
[14:11] happened to bring them to that place
[14:13] there was that was the first time that
[14:15] that couple met that was the first time
[14:16] that that man met that woman and he said
[14:19] and and they they began to start a
[14:20] relationship
[14:22] you want to go on a date with me you
[14:24] want to go out and and and get some food
[14:26] or whatever and they begin to the
[14:28] relationship began to evolve and there
[14:30] might have been some disagreements and
[14:32] things and but you see it was a process
[14:34] something something happened until one
[14:36] day it came to a place where the man got
[14:39] down on his knees and says will you
[14:41] marry me and she said she'd say yes she
[14:44] had she had the opportunity to either
[14:46] say yes or no and if she said yes then
[14:50] that started a process that wound up
[14:52] with them two there standing before the
[14:55] minister and the minister will well as
[14:58] over the course of the ceremony he'll
[15:00] ask for all these different things is
[15:02] your old do you have any living husband
[15:04] do you and if all the requirements are
[15:07] met if every requirement is met then
[15:09] he'll ask for a token and he'll slip it
[15:11] on her finger and then pronounce him
[15:13] married and he all these things all
[15:15] these requirements of the marriage
[15:17] ceremony brother branham outlined that
[15:19] those things the marriage certificate
[15:21] and the token and the ring and the
[15:23] requirements of the old man being dead
[15:26] all of those things are being played out
[15:28] in your life
[15:31] you see it now a marriage a marriage is
[15:34] a union
[15:35] now i'm talking about a real marriage we
[15:37] know that there's a lot of times in the
[15:38] natural when a man and a wife will come
[15:41] up and they'll want to be married and
[15:42] everybody's looking at that marriage
[15:44] ceremony thinking people in the
[15:45] congregation think well i know he he's
[15:48] cheating around on her and i know all
[15:50] kinds of things and that's not the kind
[15:52] of marriage that i'm talking about i'm
[15:53] talking about where where they're where
[15:55] they come and and they're standing
[15:57] before the minister and they're they
[15:59] have confidence in one another now see
[16:01] there's there's where you got a real
[16:04] marriage union a real union where the
[16:06] wife can look with the husband and she's
[16:08] got trust in him she believes that he's
[16:11] going to provide for her that he's going
[16:12] to be a good provider that he's going to
[16:15] take care of her and he's looking at her
[16:17] with confidence that she's going to have
[16:18] a character of a good christian woman
[16:21] and know that that she's going to raise
[16:23] up the right kind of a children then
[16:25] you've got a real union now a real union
[16:28] in the spiritual though a real union and
[16:31] talking about the spiritual is where the
[16:33] bride and the groom are not they're so
[16:36] united that they're not even one word
[16:38] off they're so united that he can look
[16:41] at her with trust and she can look at
[16:42] him with trusts because they're so
[16:45] united that they believe the same thing
[16:47] they're thinking the same thing they're
[16:49] doing the same thing they have become so
[16:51] united until they're one there's not one
[16:55] word off that's the kind of union that
[16:58] is an invisible union a union that you
[17:00] can't see with your natural eyes but
[17:03] something invisible has taken place
[17:05] where god is uniting himself with his
[17:07] bride
[17:09] that's why
[17:11] jesus said brother brown said jesus
[17:13] answered him saying it is written
[17:15] in luke chapter four it is written that
[17:17] man shall not live by bread alone but by
[17:20] every word of god every word of god is
[17:24] where we get our life from our
[17:25] sustenance from and that's where the
[17:27] bride will get her life from us from by
[17:30] every word of god every word of god and
[17:33] brother random said
[17:35] i hope you don't mind that i'd like to
[17:36] quote brother brown i believe that god
[17:38] has given us the gift of a man in this
[17:41] last stage that god could speak through
[17:43] and i'm not ashamed to quote things from
[17:45] what he said because everything that he
[17:47] spoke to us you could take it straight
[17:50] back to the bible and identify it with
[17:51] the bible we're not we're not quoting
[17:54] from a man that just made up stuff but
[17:56] the things that he spoke of you could
[17:58] take it back to ii peter and first peter
[18:00] and ephesians 4 and revelation 10 and
[18:02] mark malachi 4 and take it out run it
[18:05] all the way through the bible because we
[18:07] haven't heard a message from
[18:08] jeffersonville we've heard a message
[18:10] straight from the throne of god and i'm
[18:12] not ashamed to quote from the bible from
[18:14] the message tonight
[18:18] and he said there will be a bride there
[18:21] will be a bride to prove to satan that
[18:24] she is not like eve there's going to be
[18:26] a bride to prove to satan that that
[18:30] eve was not able to go
[18:32] she was not able to just stand on every
[18:34] word but she doubted it
[18:36] where did she fall she doubted hebrews
[18:38] 13 8 that jesus is the same yesterday
[18:41] today and forever but brother brahma
[18:43] said that there's going to be a bride
[18:44] that's going to prove that she is not
[18:47] y'all excuse me she is not that type of
[18:49] a woman
[18:51] he said she will be tried by his word
[18:54] the bride is adam's bride was tried by
[18:56] the word and adam's bride believed every
[18:59] bit of the word
[19:00] all but confused on one promise that
[19:02] he's the same yesterday today and
[19:04] forever today see but failed on one
[19:07] promise under the temptation of the
[19:10] enemy face to face and now the people
[19:12] that's called for his name of course is
[19:16] his bride
[19:17] do you realize why we're called the
[19:19] bride because the bride
[19:22] the bride is going to be married to the
[19:24] groom it's it's going to be a a union
[19:26] together that you it's a wedding that's
[19:29] being performed a wedding where the
[19:31] bride and the groom are coming together
[19:33] you're being married to christ how are
[19:35] you being married because you fulfill
[19:37] all the requirements the old man is dead
[19:40] it's all is
[19:42] every requirement has been met and
[19:44] brother said she has come in contact
[19:46] again by the same thing
[19:48] not by just denominational truth or
[19:50] something but every word
[19:54] not just denominational truth not just
[19:56] part truth
[19:58] not just not just some man's idea some
[20:01] man that you got to go report back to
[20:02] the to the to the overseer of the
[20:04] methodist church of the overseer of the
[20:06] presbyterian church to find out what you
[20:08] believe or the pope or some some man to
[20:10] find out what you believe but we get our
[20:13] word direct from the bible that's what
[20:15] we believe every word straight from the
[20:17] bible
[20:19] in the beginning of the bible man was
[20:21] given the word of god to live by
[20:23] one word misinterpreted by a man called
[20:26] satan and a person of an animal called
[20:27] the serpent satan and this person could
[20:30] talk to eve and miss it that's that's
[20:32] straight out of the bible that that
[20:33] beast came and talked to eve satan in
[20:36] this person could talk to eve and
[20:38] misinterpreted the word to her was lost
[20:40] see it must be every word and christ is
[20:44] going to have a bride
[20:45] he's going to have a bride that takes
[20:48] the word over the world takes the word
[20:51] over everything else takes the word over
[20:53] her own ideas takes the word over
[20:56] everything that you can throw at her now
[20:58] see paul here in romans chapter 7 has
[21:01] given an illustration in our scripture
[21:03] brother brown said about the law
[21:05] about law and grace
[21:07] and illustrating it like marriage and
[21:09] divorce
[21:10] now he said now i'm not don't get
[21:12] nervous here i'm not preaching on
[21:13] marriage and divorce but he said it
[21:15] pertains to like marriage and divorce
[21:17] but it also pertains to a greater
[21:19] portion of marriage and divorce
[21:21] that we
[21:22] as a church
[21:24] cannot can no more be married to the
[21:27] world
[21:28] and to christ
[21:29] we can no more be married to the world
[21:32] and to christ
[21:33] at the same time
[21:35] and be legal and lawful about it
[21:37] than it can be for a woman to be living
[21:39] with a husband while she's got a living
[21:41] husband
[21:42] if you want to be completely united with
[21:44] christ it's time for all that to die
[21:47] away listen all of the hollywood all of
[21:49] your all of your old desires your own
[21:52] nature all of the things that you used
[21:53] to believe all of the denominational
[21:55] idea all the things that you used to
[21:57] think in your own mind as you study the
[21:59] message all of that thing that was wrong
[22:02] has got to be dead that you can be
[22:04] united with christ
[22:08] he said it's given an illustration
[22:10] but i believe brother branham said i
[22:12] believe also is to my belief that it
[22:14] unfolds one of the great mysteries
[22:17] of prophecy
[22:18] what mystery could that be as paul was
[22:21] preaching here in romans 7 7 about being
[22:24] married what mystery could it be
[22:27] now you know you know when a normal
[22:29] wedding
[22:30] when when everything's set in a ray
[22:32] nobody sees the bride until it's time
[22:35] it's time for the marriage to to take
[22:37] place
[22:38] and the minister's standing up there and
[22:40] the and the and the bridegroom stands
[22:42] there and and everybody all the
[22:44] congregation is laid out and then they
[22:46] begin to play look we'll say a trumpet
[22:48] blows a trumpet blows and here comes the
[22:51] bride to be presented
[22:52] now you could take that back to joel in
[22:54] joel chapter 2 verse 15 and 16. it says
[22:57] blow the trumpet in zion we quote that
[22:59] scripture a lot do do you remember why
[23:02] it says blow the trumpet in zion
[23:04] blow the trumpet in zion sanctify a fast
[23:07] call a solemn assembly now now again i'm
[23:10] talking about this mystery he said it
[23:12] unfolds one of the great mysteries of
[23:14] prophecy
[23:15] in joel chapter 2 it says blow the
[23:17] trumpet in zion sanctify a fast call a
[23:20] solemn assembly gather the people gather
[23:23] the people to the wedding sanctify the
[23:26] congregation assemble the elders gather
[23:28] the children and those that suck the
[23:30] breasts everybody's come to see
[23:33] something happen and what's happening he
[23:34] said let the bridegroom go forth of his
[23:37] chamber and the bride out of her claws
[23:40] it it's time for the mystery to be
[23:41] revealed it's time for the bride to come
[23:44] forth out of her closet we know that
[23:46] maybe nobody knew what was happening
[23:48] something secret something mysterious
[23:50] but then all of a sudden the bride
[23:52] begins to come marching down the aisle
[23:54] why because the trumpet has been blown
[23:57] the trumpet has been blown that
[23:58] something's taken place what is it it's
[24:00] the union of the pride of the bridegroom
[24:05] now but when brother branham was
[24:06] preaching this sermon the invisible
[24:08] union of the bride of christ
[24:10] he began to he began to he shifts gears
[24:13] in his spots and he begins to talk about
[24:15] he begins to talk about dwight moody
[24:17] going and he's talking about he was
[24:19] reading about romans 7 the same verse
[24:22] the same chapter that i just read about
[24:24] and he began to read about law and grace
[24:27] and he ran down in the street and the
[24:29] first man he met he said do you know
[24:31] grace that why was brother branham
[24:33] saying that do you know grace because
[24:35] he's talking about a person he's talking
[24:38] about the bride he said do you know
[24:40] grace he said the man replied grace who
[24:43] and he said the grace of god the grace
[24:45] of god applied do you make what does
[24:47] that make you it makes you mrs grace and
[24:50] he starts talking about do you know mrs
[24:52] grace the elect lady there's a lady that
[24:55] grace has been applied to a lady that
[24:57] didn't do it by our own works but the
[24:59] grace of god has been applied to her and
[25:01] here she comes walking down the aisle to
[25:04] be united with her husband he said it's
[25:06] so thrilled and when he's seen what how
[25:08] grace had separated from us from the law
[25:11] and what part grace played for us by
[25:14] grace we are saved not by what we can do
[25:17] what we can whatever we do is not
[25:20] counted to us grace is what saves us by
[25:23] grace are you saved through faith it was
[25:26] grace grace crack
[25:28] the word of the lord and his room will
[25:30] grace grace to the headstone it's been
[25:32] graced all the way grace is going to
[25:34] unite you grace is what saved you and he
[25:37] said
[25:38] may i add to this woman grace may i
[25:41] place her in the bible also is called
[25:43] the elect lady this misgrace i'm going
[25:46] to talk about
[25:47] no the bible declares said to the elect
[25:49] lady that if you notice elect come from
[25:52] the word elected lady one lady amongst
[25:56] all the other ladies was elected
[25:59] like the virgin was to bring forth the
[26:00] body of god on the earth she was an
[26:03] elected woman
[26:04] god chose mary and also god has chose an
[26:08] elected lady which is his bride we're
[26:10] talking about us do you know grace and
[26:13] i'm looking at grace now i'm looking at
[26:15] the effect that grace has had on
[26:17] people's lives i'm looking at something
[26:19] that you didn't do by yourself you
[26:20] didn't deliver yourself from all that
[26:22] stuff of your old life all that that's
[26:25] now dead but it was grace the grace of
[26:27] god applied to your life
[26:30] and romans 7 takes an illustration of
[26:33] how she was brought to him and where she
[26:35] would come from how she was brought to
[26:37] him how she wound up at the platform how
[26:40] she wound up the altar there before the
[26:42] minister in the marriage ceremony where
[26:45] she come from
[26:49] you think you think about where she come
[26:51] from matters you think about that story
[26:53] of isaac and rebecca there where she
[26:55] finally met him but she came from
[26:58] somewhere she came from a place where
[26:59] she heard the messenger the messenger
[27:01] gave her a word and said will you follow
[27:03] me and she watered the camels she
[27:05] watered the thing that was going to take
[27:07] her to her isaac and she got on the
[27:09] camels and she rode and rose through the
[27:11] desert where you come from and how you
[27:13] were brought to it matters you've come
[27:15] through a journey just like any bride
[27:17] and any bridegroom you've come through a
[27:19] journey and now it's the uniting time
[27:22] and invisible unions something taking
[27:24] place
[27:26] rebecca had listened to the messenger
[27:28] she watered the camels and she left
[27:31] everything behind it was dead to her she
[27:34] left everything behind just like the
[27:36] pilgrims when they landed on plymouth
[27:38] rock she left everything behind just
[27:40] like every other type in the bible
[27:42] ruth in the bible
[27:45] all the types that you could go through
[27:47] leaving everything behind and you left
[27:49] everything behind the only way that you
[27:51] can be united to christ as if you leave
[27:53] everything behind leave it all day and
[27:56] bury it in the ground bury it so it when
[27:58] you poke at it and pry it it ain't
[28:00] coming up again it's got to be dead
[28:04] romans 7 let's read it again wherefore
[28:06] my brother and you also become dead to
[28:08] the law by the body of christ
[28:10] that you should be married to another
[28:13] even to him who was raised from the dead
[28:15] that we should bring forth fruit unto
[28:17] god for when we were in the flesh the
[28:19] moses of sin which were by the law did
[28:21] work in our members to bring forth fruit
[28:23] unto death but now we are delivered from
[28:25] the law that being dead wherein we were
[28:28] held that we should serve a newness of
[28:29] spirit and not an oldness
[28:32] of the letter
[28:33] do you know what it means to be
[28:34] delivered from the law the law is the
[28:37] judge you're judged constantly the
[28:39] finger pointer saying you broke it you
[28:41] broke it here you messed up you broke it
[28:43] but you've been delivered by the law
[28:45] because the by the new birth by the
[28:47] grace of god you've been made perfect
[28:49] you've been made perfect that nobody can
[28:51] point a finger at you because if they do
[28:53] he's looking at you through the blood
[28:55] and you've been made perfect by his
[28:56] grace his grace is what makes you
[28:59] perfect
[29:02] and she went on a voyage
[29:04] rebecca went on a forge and she didn't
[29:07] give up she didn't give up she didn't
[29:09] surrender she stayed on that voice she
[29:10] stayed on that cam and camel that she
[29:12] had watered until she got to the end of
[29:14] the journey where she met isaac and by
[29:17] the time rebecca met isaac
[29:20] she knew him she knew who she was going
[29:22] to meet she knew him but by the time she
[29:25] got to him she knew about his
[29:26] characteristics about his makeup what he
[29:29] liked and what he didn't like but she
[29:30] like knew whether he liked coffee or tea
[29:33] what she what he liked in his drink what
[29:35] all the things about him she knew
[29:37] because she knew he she had been taught
[29:39] and she had been instructed and this
[29:41] bride the spiritual bride will be no
[29:43] different by the time we see him in the
[29:45] air we'll know him so perfectly we'll
[29:47] know him because we've we've learned
[29:49] about him it's been revealed to us we've
[29:51] heard about it we've heard by a
[29:52] messenger and we know who we're going to
[29:54] be joined to we know our god like
[29:57] rebecca knew isaac we are not worshiping
[30:00] in the altar of
[30:01] some unknown mysterious god but we know
[30:04] our god we know in whom we have believed
[30:06] we know who we serve
[30:11] you know if god wants you to worship him
[30:14] if god wants you to worship him he'll
[30:16] make known to you where you've got to
[30:17] worship him at
[30:19] he'll tell you how to worship him what's
[30:21] your worship and he'll make himself
[30:22] known to you if you'll let him and
[30:24] brother i'm in the feast of trumpets he
[30:26] said and how the people that's believing
[30:28] in them know it unless they're
[30:29] constantly in the words how in the word
[30:32] how will you know him unless you're
[30:34] constantly in the word to know what he
[30:36] is to know what he is
[30:39] daniel said the wise shall know but the
[30:41] foolish the unwise wouldn't know
[30:44] they shall know their god
[30:46] now now how he shall appear in the last
[30:48] days is to bring the people back to the
[30:50] word so that the bride will know her
[30:53] husband the bride will know her husband
[30:56] know her mate the revealed husband the
[30:58] revealed word
[31:00] that's why this has to happen
[31:04] now he said the church here in
[31:05] illustration that we got in view
[31:08] is illustrated by a woman
[31:11] which a woman is always the type of the
[31:12] church
[31:14] because the church is considered a bride
[31:19] and god will have a bride that is in
[31:21] subjection
[31:23] to his headship
[31:26] could you imagine
[31:28] could you imagine i know there's a lot
[31:30] of cases where this is true could you
[31:31] imagine a woman that was not in
[31:32] agreement with her husband there's a lot
[31:34] of cases in the in the world where that
[31:36] this is true that
[31:37] we know just observing your friends and
[31:39] the family and and people at work and
[31:41] think we know that there's
[31:43] what a sad thing for a man and a woman
[31:45] to get married and constantly be
[31:47] fighting every decision that has to be
[31:49] made you're constantly constantly at
[31:51] odds whether or not to have one bank
[31:53] account or have separate many times
[31:55] people have divide up their bank
[31:56] accounts because they just can't become
[31:58] they just can't be become in agreement
[32:02] i'm i'm speaking spiritual now i know
[32:04] this kind of hits it in in the natural
[32:06] realm a little bit but i'm talking about
[32:07] spiritual how can how can christ and his
[32:10] bride they can't be in union if they're
[32:12] a disagreement if they're in disrespect
[32:14] you've got to be in agreement with the
[32:16] word when you look into the bible and
[32:18] you wonder i i i wonder if this is true
[32:21] that how can god be united with you if
[32:23] you wonder if his word is true if you
[32:24] wonder if the message is true if you
[32:26] wonder if what the preacher is preaching
[32:28] about if you're if you're not in
[32:29] subjection to the word
[32:31] a woman a
[32:32] a man that's trying to set a standard
[32:35] for his home and he says that we've
[32:36] we've got to dress like this we're going
[32:38] to church on sunday and his wife is
[32:40] constantly well i'm not going to church
[32:42] they're not in union they're not in
[32:43] unity and why because she's not in
[32:45] subjection to the word
[32:47] a real christian woman is going to be in
[32:49] subjection to a real christian husband
[32:52] because she's going to be in subjection
[32:54] to the word to the word now
[32:58] a man tries to set a standard and
[33:01] you see what that's what exactly what
[33:03] happened in the garden of eden the
[33:04] serpent came around and it began to
[33:06] betray eve began to slip away from the
[33:09] trust that she had in her husband and
[33:11] she began to think that maybe her
[33:12] husband wasn't telling her everything
[33:14] maybe he wasn't telling her the whole
[33:16] story and the serpent said unto the
[33:18] woman ye shall not surely die for god
[33:20] nothing no then the day ye thereof then
[33:23] your eyes shall be opened and ye shall
[33:24] be as gods knowing good and evil wow i'm
[33:27] gonna know more i'm gonna know more than
[33:29] everybody else that sounds like a great
[33:32] plan a great idea to know more than
[33:34] everybody else to not be in subjection
[33:36] look at look at the characteristics of
[33:38] that woman brother branham said look at
[33:40] the characteristics she thought she was
[33:42] right
[33:44] she thought she was right how many
[33:46] people in the world today think they're
[33:48] right and they're going around into
[33:49] delusion and he said he began to explain
[33:52] how you can't tell people you can't tell
[33:54] anybody anymore because they think
[33:56] they're right
[33:57] a woman that thinks she's right well i
[33:59] know i know i'm right i'm not going to
[34:01] church i'm not i'm not doing i'm not
[34:04] submitting to the standard that god's
[34:06] word requires i'm not going to do that
[34:08] she's not in subjection to the word and
[34:11] if you're not in subjection to your
[34:12] husband you're not in subjection to the
[34:15] word i said i'm talking about godly
[34:17] husband i'm not talking about a bunch of
[34:19] trash like driving home driving home one
[34:21] night
[34:22] do i do i have permission to get a drink
[34:25] do i have permission to get a bag of
[34:27] doritos i'm hungry that's a bunch of
[34:29] tommy rod i'm talking about the truth
[34:30] i'm talking about real real christian
[34:33] submission and subjection where you're
[34:35] in subjection because you love one
[34:37] another because you have trust in one
[34:39] another because you trust your husband
[34:41] that's the kind of subjection i'm
[34:42] talking about
[34:46] when the woman saw that the tree was
[34:47] good for food and it was pleasant to the
[34:49] eyes and a tree to be desired to make
[34:51] one wise tree to be desired to make one
[34:54] know something more more than everybody
[34:56] else she took of the fruit thereof and
[34:58] then eaten gave also to under her
[34:59] husband with her and he did eat how many
[35:01] times have we seen that kind of that
[35:03] played out a woman that wants to tell
[35:06] tell her husband how he should be
[35:07] running in his affairs and tell her tell
[35:09] him tell him how he should be how she
[35:11] should be conducting his spiritual life
[35:13] well i don't believe we should go to
[35:14] church over there i think we should go
[35:15] to church over there and he runs along
[35:17] with her like a like a little dog on a
[35:19] leash because she's not in subjection to
[35:22] the word
[35:23] let a man be have a rulership over his
[35:25] house listen this ain't politically
[35:27] correct but it's biblical biblically
[35:29] correct and i believe in the truth of
[35:31] the gospel
[35:32] if we know the truth we are obligated to
[35:35] preach the truth we're obligated to
[35:36] speak the truth we have the truth and
[35:38] let's live the truth how can you be
[35:40] united to your husband if you're not
[35:42] united every word one word often
[35:44] sometimes it might hurt and scald a
[35:46] little bit but it's still the truth and
[35:48] it'll do you good it's still good
[35:50] medicine even if it hurts going down
[35:53] he said she stepped out this is what eve
[35:55] did she stepped out from behind the
[35:57] protection of the word she was no longer
[36:00] in subjection to the word
[36:04] first peter chapter 3 says for after
[36:06] this manner in the old time the holy
[36:08] women also who trusted in god adorned
[36:10] themselves being in subjection unto
[36:12] their own husbands and subject that's
[36:15] how they adorn themselves you see a good
[36:17] christian lady in subjection to her
[36:18] husband she's not even really in
[36:20] subjection to his maybe maybe strange
[36:23] ideas and the strange political views
[36:25] and all that but a godly woman is going
[36:27] to be in subjection to the word the
[36:29] standard of the word that her husband is
[36:31] trying to set forth he said even as
[36:33] sarah obeyed abraham calling them lord
[36:35] whose daughters you are as long as you
[36:37] do well and are not afraid with any
[36:39] amazement
[36:41] subjection what how how do we subject
[36:44] yourself what are we subjecting
[36:45] ourselves to we're subjecting ourselves
[36:47] to the word to this bible when the bible
[36:51] says something we it might hurt it might
[36:52] scald us a little bit but we yield
[36:54] ourselves to it and we lay our own will
[36:57] down at the altar like like christ
[36:59] himself did in the garden of gethsemane
[37:01] and said father not my will be done
[37:03] father not my will but thine be done thy
[37:06] will be done we're looking for his will
[37:08] we're looking to lay down our own will
[37:10] and obey what he said that's what
[37:12] subjection is there at the altar of the
[37:15] marriage union the woman is in
[37:17] subjection to the husband subject
[37:19] subject to us to subject oneself to obey
[37:23] to submit to one's control to yield to
[37:26] one's admonition or advice to obey to be
[37:29] subject
[37:33] subject to a godly man that's what i'm
[37:34] talking about i'm not talking about a
[37:36] man that's like a neanderthal with a
[37:37] great big old forehead going around i
[37:39] bless god i i know what i'm doing and
[37:41] doing all sorts of sorts of strange
[37:43] things bless god i i know we need i know
[37:45] we need to put the kids through school
[37:47] but i'm going to spend everything every
[37:48] bit of money we got on a big old giant
[37:50] truck bless god making all sorts of
[37:52] strange decisions listen we're talking
[37:53] about the word being said is subject to
[37:55] the word
[37:57] subject where the wife can say
[38:00] well if a woman says i i don't
[38:01] understand why she go why we should go
[38:03] to church i don't understand why what
[38:05] i'm wearing matters i don't see the
[38:07] problem with that i don't understand why
[38:09] this and i don't understand why that you
[38:11] see that's not being unders in
[38:12] subjection
[38:14] you see what's happening to us as we've
[38:16] received the word at first we didn't
[38:18] understand and maybe we pushed back it a
[38:20] little bit maybe we argued with it a
[38:22] little bit i don't i don't understand
[38:23] why this i don't understand why we need
[38:25] to understand the statue of a perfect
[38:26] man how about this i don't understand
[38:29] why we need to know daniel two weeks i
[38:31] don't understand why all these things
[38:33] are important i don't understand what
[38:35] adoption is about i don't understand but
[38:37] one day as you kept feeding you begin to
[38:39] understand why because the word is
[38:41] claiming your life it's taking you over
[38:43] it's uniting him with yourself it's
[38:45] uniting it's uniting you with christ
[38:48] subjection what is subjection subjection
[38:51] is understanding it's understanding
[38:55] and when you don't understand
[38:58] subjection is trust when you can trust
[39:01] your husband knowing i'm talking
[39:03] spiritually now when you can trust your
[39:05] husband knowing that even if you take
[39:07] somebody out of your life and they die
[39:09] to go in the grave before their time
[39:11] you're trusting him even if you don't
[39:12] understand even when you get sick and
[39:14] you don't understand why you got those
[39:16] problems in your and your
[39:18] in your belly and in your feet and your
[39:20] hips you're trusting him even if you
[39:22] don't understand that's what subjection
[39:24] is subjection
[39:28] and eve stepped out from subjection to
[39:31] the word
[39:32] eve stepped out
[39:34] what is subjection my husband is my
[39:35] protector he means what he says i've got
[39:38] confidence in him he's reliable and
[39:40] faithful to do all that he promised i
[39:43] know that his word is true i believe
[39:45] that whatever god says is true and i'm
[39:48] clinging to his promises even if i don't
[39:50] yet see them manifested that's what
[39:53] subjection is abraham was in subjection
[39:56] when he was promised a child and he
[39:58] walked and he walked and he didn't see
[39:59] that child but yet he had trust in god
[40:02] that god was going to bring it to pass
[40:04] he was in subjection to the word he was
[40:06] in subjection when he took isaac up on
[40:08] the mountain and he offered him he was
[40:10] ready to bring that knife down because
[40:12] he was a subjection to the word subject
[40:15] you see we're not in we're not
[40:18] we're not preaching something where
[40:19] you've got to be you you've got to be
[40:21] like some kind of a prisoner or
[40:22] something
[40:23] it's a it's a prison of love
[40:25] we're we're changeable just like a man
[40:28] and a woman there at the altar she's in
[40:30] subjection to him because she loves him
[40:32] because she believes him because she
[40:35] trusts him because she understands him
[40:37] that's what brings subjection i'm
[40:39] talking about a real godly subjection
[40:41] not all this tommy rock that's been
[40:43] preached for years but a godly loving
[40:46] subjection
[40:49] he stepped out from subjection to the
[40:51] word and what did it do it threw her
[40:52] into nakedness and debauchery and
[40:55] carnality it threw the whole earth into
[40:57] sin and all the while the whole while
[41:01] she believed that she was right
[41:03] she believed she was right and genesis 4
[41:07] 1 says i and adam knew eve his wife and
[41:08] she conceived and bear cain and said i
[41:10] have gotten
[41:11] i have gotten a man from the lord and we
[41:13] know that all life comes from god but i
[41:15] believe that there's an underlying
[41:17] meaning there she was preached he was
[41:18] preaching something she was crowing a
[41:20] little bit you see all this has happened
[41:22] y'all thought i was wrong but really
[41:25] really now i have gotten a man from the
[41:27] lord see
[41:28] all this time y'all thought that it
[41:30] wouldn't work out right but it did
[41:32] didn't noah did she even even even in
[41:35] that sinful condition that she was
[41:37] living in were hurt now she recognized
[41:39] she knew she was naked which before she
[41:41] had been covered by
[41:43] covered by a veil of god and all that
[41:45] look look at the world today where
[41:47] people living in nakedness and living in
[41:48] debaltry and they don't recognize that
[41:51] they don't recognize that there's
[41:53] something wrong and they think that
[41:55] they're right
[41:59] we've got to be in submission to our
[42:00] husbands
[42:02] a woman
[42:03] that's not in submission to her husband
[42:06] i'm gonna read this
[42:08] this is scalding
[42:10] hey
[42:11] thank you brother louise
[42:13] is your life worthy of the gospel
[42:14] brother braham said i was preaching the
[42:16] other night somewhere about women to
[42:17] obey their husband
[42:19] that went out of the marriage ritual a
[42:20] long time ago but they ain't going to do
[42:22] that no sir
[42:23] it's went out of the marriage ritual
[42:25] because people have gotten so wound up
[42:26] in what's politically right what's
[42:28] what's modern what's correct what's
[42:31] correct and what's correct now is nobody
[42:32] needs to be offended
[42:34] everybody's right nobody will be
[42:36] offended and
[42:38] he said they live in america and they
[42:40] let you know so they're not going to
[42:42] obey they ain't gonna obey
[42:44] but as long as you don't do it don't
[42:46] never
[42:48] try to call yourself a christian
[42:50] because you're not right now you think
[42:52] about that a woman that will not be in
[42:54] subjection to her husband i'm talking
[42:56] about the the word the word over her
[42:58] house that won't be in subjection to her
[43:00] husband is not
[43:01] a christian he said i don't care how
[43:03] much you dance and speak with tongues if
[43:05] you don't obey your husband you're out
[43:07] of the will of god
[43:08] out of the will of god
[43:11] i hope i hope i'm preaching this with a
[43:13] balance tonight i i'm not preaching some
[43:15] kind of tommy right where your husband's
[43:17] gotta like hold an anvil over your head
[43:18] constantly threatening to drop it if you
[43:20] don't do everything he says but i'm
[43:22] talking i'm talking about
[43:23] i'm talking about holding the word of
[43:25] god the word of god over your home
[43:28] you've got to be in subject to that when
[43:30] the man says we're going to church when
[43:32] the man says let's pray when the man
[43:34] says we're going to we're going to have
[43:35] we're going to put god first in
[43:37] everything we do when the man says let's
[43:38] turn the tv off when the man says let's
[43:40] kick the tv out and the woman's not in
[43:42] subjection there's something wrong the
[43:45] man
[43:46] this is this is a preaching to the men
[43:47] too what where is the man in the message
[43:50] where is a man that'll set a standard
[43:51] for your home set a standard where
[43:53] you're gonna put god first over
[43:55] everything else that's that's the way to
[43:57] have a real christian home is to put god
[44:00] first over your children over your ch of
[44:02] your wife to love god more than you even
[44:04] love your wife to love god more than
[44:06] everything else put him over
[44:09] you you even think about us ministers
[44:11] when we go to study we've got to devote
[44:13] ourselves to the word of god and prayer
[44:15] we can't we don't have time to be to be
[44:17] attending to every need and every
[44:19] everything that maybe our wife wants us
[44:20] to do because we're laboring to bring
[44:23] something to the church we're putting
[44:24] god first you've got to put god first to
[44:31] this might bore you and put you to sleep
[44:32] a little bit but it's still the truth
[44:35] now he said he said watch the conditions
[44:37] and the conduct of women and you'll see
[44:39] where the church is watch the conditions
[44:41] of the conduct of women and you'll see
[44:43] where the church is you watch everything
[44:45] in the natural how it's happening in
[44:47] nature and watch it it sure runs with
[44:48] the spiritual also now if you'll see the
[44:51] conduct of women in the world today
[44:53] watch the conduct of the worldly church
[44:54] today just watch
[44:57] of course now there's
[44:58] the conduct of the spiritual bride the
[45:00] church see watch that also
[45:03] they see watch the character the
[45:05] character when you see women going on
[45:07] the rampage just doing anything they
[45:08] want to do watch the churches doing the
[45:10] same thing and you can look out on the
[45:13] in the world and see women women are
[45:14] just dressing anyway thinking anything
[45:16] doing whatever and the church the church
[45:18] is doing the same thing the church world
[45:21] has begun to do the same thing where
[45:22] they preach whatever they don't they're
[45:24] not concerned with truth they're just
[45:26] concerned whatever whatever matches up
[45:27] with their denominational idea they
[45:30] don't and you can't tell them he said
[45:31] you can't tell a woman of the world you
[45:33] can't tell the religious church world we
[45:36] see the church natural in your
[45:37] intellectual gospel going further and
[45:39] further away from the word we find that
[45:41] the women of the world on the streets
[45:43] members of such is carrying themselves
[45:45] in the same atmosphere and you can't
[45:47] tell them they've lost all sense of
[45:49] common decency that people have do you
[45:52] realize what a great gift it is to even
[45:54] to be able to receive any any kind of
[45:56] correction because the world can't
[45:58] receive correction anymore you tell
[46:00] somebody
[46:01] why don't you go to church what don't
[46:02] you don't you need know that you need to
[46:04] you need jesus nobody wants correction
[46:07] anymore nobody even wants correction in
[46:08] the natural
[46:13] he said it's got plenty to eat plenty to
[46:14] wear fine churches big places find
[46:17] educated ministers and so they don't
[46:19] need nothing else
[46:20] but you don't know the scripture said
[46:22] you are naked miserable blind and don't
[46:24] know it don't know it and you can't tell
[46:27] them no different
[46:28] he said in investments what if you met
[46:30] such a person as that and they would
[46:31] turn around to you and tell you to tend
[46:33] to your own business they don't even
[46:35] know that they're in that condition now
[46:37] if you're that way and know it it's not
[46:40] too bad if you know you're in that
[46:41] condition you can do something about it
[46:43] but when you are that way and don't know
[46:45] it that's the bad part
[46:47] you can't tell them
[46:49] people that you can't tell
[46:51] the church world that you can't tell
[46:52] women that you can't tell but the
[46:54] spiritual church the spiritual church is
[46:57] somebody that can be told told by the
[47:00] word told by a minister preaching the
[47:02] truth told by the word because the real
[47:04] bride is going to line up with the word
[47:06] the lamb's wife is going to be lined up
[47:08] with the word he said watch when the
[47:10] spiritual bride when she begins to have
[47:12] a revival when she begins to come back
[47:14] and line herself up with the word what
[47:16] kind of a revival people were looking
[47:18] for a revival or ever the whole building
[47:20] is in it just in a great uproar and
[47:22] people running down the aisles but this
[47:24] kind of revival is a different kind of
[47:26] revival it's a revival where the
[47:28] individual is lining up with the word in
[47:31] an invisible union something invisible
[47:34] taking place a revival a personal
[47:35] revival
[47:37] think about that a personal revival
[47:39] where you could be having a revival and
[47:41] the person next to you don't even know
[47:42] what's taking place the word begin to
[47:45] quicken in somebody's heart and
[47:46] something something something's
[47:48] happening a personal what is it you're
[47:50] getting under headship subjection to the
[47:52] word a word revival which is why joel in
[47:55] joel chapter 2 said the floor shall be
[47:57] full of wheat and the fat shall overflow
[48:00] with wine and oil and i will restore to
[48:02] you the years that the locusts hath
[48:04] eaten the
[48:05] i'm going to restore you shall eat
[48:06] plenty and be satisfied you're going to
[48:08] eat in plenty because it's a word
[48:10] revival everything that you have need of
[48:12] you can just eat and eat and eat and
[48:14] what what happens what's the effect of
[48:16] that revival you begin to line up with
[48:18] the word
[48:19] you begin to line up
[48:21] why does brother brown say all this kind
[48:23] of stuff let me just pause so so you
[48:25] don't get tired on me
[48:27] why was he talking about lining up
[48:28] because as you line up
[48:30] things are dying
[48:32] things are leaving
[48:33] and when things are dying right when
[48:35] things are leaving your your life then
[48:38] you're you're uniting more and more with
[48:40] him he said you notice when the people
[48:41] begin to try line with the word there
[48:44] comes a fresh message from the word of
[48:46] the word of god right straight to the
[48:48] people and they catch that message they
[48:50] catch that word and they line up
[48:53] in luther's day they lined up with this
[48:55] message and wesley
[48:56] he preached a message of sanctification
[48:58] and they lined up with that and
[49:00] pentecost come with the restoration of
[49:01] the gifts and they lined up with that
[49:03] well what when the message the message
[49:05] that reveals the full bible from end to
[49:07] end the fullness the headship what are
[49:10] we going to do with that we're going to
[49:11] line up with it we're going to receive
[49:13] it we believe it and we're going to line
[49:14] up with it the elect of that day and
[49:16] then faded away went right back off into
[49:18] nominationalism and went right out with
[49:20] the rest of them all of them right down
[49:22] the line but the church lined up with it
[49:24] the bride lined up with it god has sent
[49:27] us a message of full restoration to give
[49:29] us power
[49:30] what power is his word he's given us his
[49:33] word the power to line up to line up
[49:36] totally and completely with his word so
[49:38] that we can be united with
[49:42] him because if her old husband if a
[49:45] woman's old husband if her old husband
[49:47] is dead
[49:48] her old life
[49:50] her old nature
[49:51] her old desires
[49:53] her old beliefs all that is gone
[49:56] if all if she's in total subjection
[49:59] and all that old life is dead there's
[50:01] nothing there's no impediment to a
[50:03] lawful marriage
[50:06] the bride and the bridegroom standing
[50:08] there ready to be married and the
[50:09] minister says
[50:11] in this holy state these two persons
[50:13] come to be joined
[50:15] if there is anyone here
[50:17] that can show a just cause while they
[50:19] should not be lawfully joined together
[50:21] in this holy matrimony
[50:23] do you now speak or from here for here
[50:25] after forever hold your peace
[50:27] is there any reason why these two cannot
[50:29] be joined together is there a living
[50:31] spouse is there
[50:32] in other words if there's anything
[50:34] that's still alive in that person's life
[50:37] they can't be joined together the old
[50:39] nature's got to be dead
[50:42] the prophet paul here saying that a
[50:43] woman can't remarry until her first
[50:45] husband is dead she cannot remarry as
[50:48] long as her first husband is living she
[50:49] by no circumstances at all she must
[50:52] remain single as long as her husband is
[50:55] living
[50:56] she can't be married to a denomination
[50:58] and be the bride of christ at the same
[50:59] time
[51:00] she's got to be dead to one or the other
[51:03] the law says so here
[51:05] he said there's plenty of laws in god's
[51:07] word and that's his law paul's speaking
[51:09] the same thing here she cannot be
[51:11] married to a church of worldly creed
[51:13] and be the bride of christ
[51:15] because one is contrary to the other
[51:18] she can't be married to her old idea she
[51:21] can't be married she said say well we
[51:23] believe this but we don't believe that
[51:25] if you're married to christ christ is
[51:27] the word of god i hope tonight that this
[51:29] brings you confidence that something's
[51:31] taken place in your life that you can
[51:33] look back and see parts and pieces
[51:36] falling away dead in your life and
[51:37] you're as you're going along like maybe
[51:39] rebecca looking back and
[51:41] as she was riding those camels and
[51:42] realizing that there's a change taking
[51:44] place in her life until when she finally
[51:46] met isaac she was in harmony with him
[51:49] she was in unity with him he said if
[51:51] you're married to christ christ is the
[51:53] word christ was the living word he
[51:55] always was the word he is still the word
[51:58] and you can be joined with that word
[52:00] you've got to be dead
[52:03] you say it's fine for me to come to
[52:05] party on saturday go to party on
[52:06] saturday and come to church on sunday
[52:08] oh something's something's not dead
[52:11] something's not as long as i as long as
[52:13] this feel as long as i can feel his
[52:14] presence i'm all right now well now
[52:17] there's something quite not right there
[52:19] that oh the doctrine of one god isn't so
[52:21] important it is not so important well
[52:23] something's not dead yet it's important
[52:26] it matters what you believe oh the
[52:28] doctrine of baptism in jesus name isn't
[52:30] so important
[52:31] or how about this i i went fishing with
[52:33] brother branham so i know i'm all right
[52:35] see all these old ideas you got to lay
[52:38] down those old that's got to be dead
[52:40] i went fishing i know i know people that
[52:42] hung out with brother branham well
[52:43] that's got to be dead because you've got
[52:45] to know christ there's no there's no
[52:47] other absolute outside of christ you
[52:49] can't even have and you're absolutely
[52:51] not even the things that you read off
[52:53] the page it's got to be revealed to you
[52:55] unders you say understand i understand
[52:57] why revelation ain't so important i
[52:58] don't why do i need a revelation
[53:00] something's not dead yet
[53:02] something not and you see you come to
[53:04] church and you get poked out a little
[53:05] bit by the preaching of the gospel and
[53:06] something rises up that shows that it's
[53:08] not dead yet when you poke at it and it
[53:11] rises up and flares up well you can't
[53:13] tell me you're not in subjection yet
[53:16] you're not in subjection to your husband
[53:18] you got to come to a place where you're
[53:19] not saying you can't tell me what i can
[53:21] believe you can't tell me what i got to
[53:23] do you got to be in subjection and then
[53:25] you can be united with your husband you
[53:27] say it don't matter what i do as long as
[53:30] i say i believe but it does matter you
[53:32] see there's something that ain't quite
[53:34] dead yet you got to be dead you got to
[53:37] lay that old man in the ground cause you
[53:39] got to be dead because it can't meet you
[53:42] can't mix the old man and the new man it
[53:45] won't mix you can't hybridize it you
[53:47] can't mix denomination creed with the
[53:49] word because they're too contrary one to
[53:51] the other
[53:53] that's why
[53:54] jesus taught that parable he said the
[53:56] lord said if you had faith as a mustard
[53:58] grain of mustard seed
[54:00] a grain of mustard seed and brother ryan
[54:02] said mustard seed cannot be hybridized
[54:05] it can't be hybridized it's faith that
[54:08] ain't mixed with nothing else let's sit
[54:10] on that for a little bit
[54:12] now that's what believed the signs said
[54:14] they they did all their research in the
[54:15] on believe the sign website they said
[54:17] they said well that brother ram was
[54:19] wrong there because we found a type of
[54:21] mustard seed that can be hybridized well
[54:24] i was reading online this brother that
[54:26] was on facebook he got and he did some
[54:28] research on it and come to find out that
[54:30] that mustard seed that they found out
[54:33] could be hybridized was a genetically
[54:35] modified mustard seed that they got in
[54:38] there and tweaked the jeans a little bit
[54:40] so that it could be hybridized but real
[54:43] original mustard seed cannot be
[54:46] hybridized now you see that's what the
[54:48] website's like i'm gonna hit that a
[54:50] little bit the website's like that like
[54:51] believe the sign are like that because
[54:53] they put a bunch of nonsense out there
[54:55] that that if you just really sit down if
[54:58] you've got the time and the common sense
[55:00] and
[55:01] and the effort and you want to put the
[55:02] effort into it you can easily prove out
[55:05] point by point i i got to read i sat
[55:07] down one one day and i just began to
[55:09] read through all the stuff on believe
[55:11] the sign and i went through i said well
[55:13] that's easy to say to disprove that's
[55:15] easy because if you know what you're
[55:18] talking if you understand if you know
[55:20] you're god then that stuff ain't going
[55:22] to shake you i'm sorry it's not going to
[55:25] shake you if you know you're god you
[55:27] remember when jesus asked the question
[55:28] of his disciples he said who do you say
[55:30] that i the son of man and and they all i
[55:34] well some say this and some say that but
[55:36] then he turned to peter and peter knew
[55:38] so you see sometimes if you want to get
[55:40] the right answer you need to find
[55:42] somebody that knows what they're talking
[55:44] about and maybe this sounds a little bit
[55:46] arrogant and boastful but i believe
[55:48] there's people in the message today that
[55:49] know what they're talking about and if
[55:51] you want to find out the truth hold one
[55:53] of these people out go to ask them some
[55:55] questions and some of the tomfoolery
[55:56] that you'll find out on facebook and
[55:58] you'll get a real answer you'll get a
[56:00] real answer like jesus got back from
[56:01] peter when he said thou the christ the
[56:04] son of the living god if you ask
[56:05] somebody that knows what they're talking
[56:07] about you get an answer
[56:13] he said that's what creed has done
[56:14] tonight
[56:15] denominations separated the people from
[56:17] the word of god
[56:18] didn't jesus say when he said when he
[56:20] come you through your tradition have
[56:21] made the commandments of god of no
[56:23] effect to the people we have separated
[56:25] the people so by denomination that they
[56:27] cannot have a chance to see it
[56:29] that's what exactly what satan tried to
[56:31] do with his intellectual concepted eve
[56:33] he said see we said we so many times we
[56:35] try to figure it out with our
[56:36] intellectual conception we try to reason
[56:38] it out and that's exactly what believe
[56:41] the sign is trying to target in that
[56:43] ironic that it's called believe the sign
[56:45] we believe the sign and then we go we go
[56:47] stumble across that website and it says
[56:49] believe the sign and we think well they
[56:51] believe the sign but what they're
[56:53] hypocrites they don't even represent the
[56:55] very thing that their their domain name
[56:57] says about them they say they believe
[56:59] the sign but they don't believe nothing
[57:00] they become a faithless and a perverse
[57:02] generation given over to their carnal
[57:04] lust and their carnal desires they don't
[57:06] even know what they stand for their stan
[57:08] they know what they stand against but
[57:10] they don't know
[57:14] they don't know nothing
[57:16] he said now she is a woman if she is
[57:17] married to christ the word she cannot be
[57:19] married to a church denomination at the
[57:21] same time for she's bound by it for she
[57:23] cannot live with both husbands at the
[57:25] same time
[57:26] one's got to be dead to have the other
[57:28] and if she tries to mix them she shall
[57:30] be called an adulteress if you mix it up
[57:32] you're an adulteress what adulteress can
[57:34] enter heaven and brother brown said what
[57:36] adulteress can enter heaven
[57:38] would god marry an adulteress
[57:41] would god marry an adulteress somebody
[57:43] that's this
[57:44] that doesn't want to believe all his
[57:45] word
[57:46] somebody that well i don't know if i can
[57:48] trust you i don't know about that
[57:51] you say the word is what's going to
[57:52] change me i don't know about that i i i
[57:55] i'd rather have a good feeling than sit
[57:57] and listen to the word clean me out and
[57:59] the word sanctify me i'd i'd rather just
[58:01] have a good feeling than to go home and
[58:04] and and roll around in the muck and the
[58:05] wire of the word
[58:08] marriage is the oldest institution in
[58:09] the world brotherhood said marriage was
[58:11] performed first and instituted in the
[58:13] garden of eden right
[58:15] and marriage requires certain things
[58:19] y'all doing all right i i feel like
[58:24] he said a woman is entrusted with sir i
[58:26] know i know this is a little bit we're
[58:27] waiting on deep water for a wednesday
[58:29] night uh or tuesday night
[58:33] but it's all right
[58:36] a woman he said a woman is entrusted
[58:38] with certain characters that she must
[58:40] not defile
[58:41] and you know he lines them out he
[58:43] outlines them all she got to have
[58:44] character
[58:45] she's got to be a subjection to her
[58:47] husband i'm gonna just kind of skim
[58:49] through these requirements she's got to
[58:50] have character that she protects
[58:52] she protects her character what what
[58:54] kind of we're talking about we're
[58:56] talking about character the statue of a
[58:58] perfect man is character so when you
[59:00] come to be married you got to have
[59:01] character and not our own character but
[59:03] his character and you got to have
[59:06] what matters is your children what kind
[59:07] of children is a godly woman we're going
[59:09] to raise what kind of a
[59:11] child is this kind of woman going to
[59:13] raise children that's born out there in
[59:15] the denomination of quagmire are
[59:17] children that come forth screaming and
[59:19] shouting born of a new birth born by the
[59:21] word that's the kind of a children that
[59:23] the bride of christ produces children
[59:25] that are born real born again children
[59:28] that's the kind of children that she
[59:29] produces and a woman that's in
[59:31] subjection to her husband trusted him
[59:33] and believing in him he said a woman a
[59:35] woman's got to protect that virtue
[59:37] because she's a betting ground for life
[59:39] and that's why you've got to protect
[59:41] your christian ver i'm talking about
[59:43] spiritually now spiritually you don't go
[59:45] listening to every every every every
[59:47] kind of strange doctrine because you're
[59:49] protecting that betting ground the
[59:51] bettinger the word the seeds got to come
[59:54] through the body and that's how life
[59:55] comes forth that's why a preacher that's
[59:58] not preaching the truth how can life
[59:59] come forth but when the but when the
[1:00:01] word of god
[1:00:03] when that character is protected that
[1:00:05] virtue is protected you haven't been
[1:00:06] listening to a bunch of nonsense and
[1:00:08] tomfoolery then life can come forth life
[1:00:11] will come forth through the body
[1:00:13] believers the character of a woman the
[1:00:15] character of a christian woman the
[1:00:17] strength of this christian woman
[1:00:19] somebody that will be in subjection to
[1:00:21] her to her to her husband
[1:00:23] and bring forth children bring forth
[1:00:25] real children he said in the spoken word
[1:00:27] as the original seed the seed of christ
[1:00:29] must come through his body not through
[1:00:32] the nomination but through a born-again
[1:00:34] seed of the word must come through how
[1:00:36] does my seed come through through my
[1:00:38] body how does the apple tree seed come
[1:00:40] through through the body seed is through
[1:00:42] the body and the church is the body of
[1:00:44] christ which is why it's got to be
[1:00:46] protected
[1:00:48] it matters what you believe
[1:00:53] and when that woman that bride comes
[1:00:54] before comes before the minister to be
[1:00:56] married she's got before if she's all
[1:00:58] that stuff in her life all that past
[1:01:00] that she's done she's got to confess any
[1:01:02] wrong she's got to confess otherwise
[1:01:05] you can't be joined in matrimony you
[1:01:07] can't be joined together she's got a
[1:01:09] sacred trust of virtue committed to her
[1:01:11] by her lord a certain virtue the same as
[1:01:14] the church that was married to the law
[1:01:16] has to come also before christ before
[1:01:17] the second marriage she's got to confess
[1:01:20] that
[1:01:21] how are we going to be married to christ
[1:01:22] if we don't confess all of the things
[1:01:24] that we believed that was wrong all of
[1:01:26] the things i i i think that should throw
[1:01:28] us all to to to desire to repent desire
[1:01:31] to make things right because it's got to
[1:01:33] be confessed he said that's committed to
[1:01:35] her sacred virtue
[1:01:37] sacred womanhood and then sacred
[1:01:39] motherhood honor her husband husband
[1:01:42] she's been given this sacred trust that
[1:01:44] she must not break
[1:01:46] of womanhood
[1:01:47] have her character
[1:01:49] her character
[1:01:51] raise her children
[1:01:53] her children's got to be born right and
[1:01:55] raised up right that's the kind of bride
[1:01:57] that christ is going to have the bride
[1:02:00] that's going to preach the gospel
[1:02:01] children are going to be born right
[1:02:02] raised up right ephesians 4 11 and 12
[1:02:05] fulfilled that in that body
[1:02:07] five full ministry is going to be
[1:02:09] preaching the word so that the children
[1:02:10] are raised upright
[1:02:14] be honorable to her husband
[1:02:16] and how are you honorable to your
[1:02:17] husband you don't you don't go standing
[1:02:19] up there at that altar in front of in
[1:02:20] front of the minister uh a woman think
[1:02:22] about a woman thinking about one the the
[1:02:25] best man or
[1:02:26] or you know thinking about somebody in
[1:02:28] the congregation or something like
[1:02:29] casting their eyes hither and yawn
[1:02:32] you see brother brandon said look look
[1:02:34] at what hollywood has done it's turned
[1:02:36] the whole thing into just a big
[1:02:38] adulterous mess where where girls don't
[1:02:40] even know how to act right because their
[1:02:41] their parents have got the hollywood on
[1:02:43] the tv with all that kissing and
[1:02:44] slopping and all that stuff going around
[1:02:46] and and what does that produce it
[1:02:48] produces an adulterous generation where
[1:02:50] there's no there's no confidence between
[1:02:52] one another there's
[1:02:54] he said the church is just as bad right
[1:02:56] committing adultery with everything and
[1:02:58] she's no business to be going into she
[1:03:00] should stay with the word
[1:03:02] because you've got a sacred trust
[1:03:04] a sacred trust to your husband what a
[1:03:06] sacred trust what a responsibility to a
[1:03:09] woman now see why she's the type of the
[1:03:11] church
[1:03:13] how you how you know
[1:03:15] how can you identify the bride he said
[1:03:17] look at her love her
[1:03:18] watch her love her
[1:03:21] watch what she's in love with
[1:03:23] watch what kind of children she's
[1:03:24] bearing
[1:03:26] watch whether her children are wanting
[1:03:28] to stay away from the world and and live
[1:03:30] right and do right and actually be born
[1:03:31] right born by the word what kind of a
[1:03:34] children what kind of children is she
[1:03:35] born at bearing is she bearing children
[1:03:37] like galatians 4 6 that says you come
[1:03:40] forth crying out by father crying after
[1:03:42] your father crying knowing your father
[1:03:45] and crying after him
[1:03:47] we we need to have a wedding ceremony we
[1:03:50] need to be married to christ but you got
[1:03:52] to separate yourself by death from your
[1:03:54] first denominational husband
[1:03:56] you must be dead to your first husband
[1:03:58] now you go you go back and listen to
[1:04:00] that sermon and find out how many times
[1:04:02] brother brown repeats that over and over
[1:04:04] it almost sounds like a broken record
[1:04:06] you got to be dead
[1:04:08] you got to be dead to your first tusman
[1:04:09] what does dead mean jesus you know jesus
[1:04:11] actually let lazarus die
[1:04:14] he didn't go back so that he could die
[1:04:16] why did he let him die so that his
[1:04:18] resurrection power could be made
[1:04:19] manifest in his life he let him die and
[1:04:21] that's what we've got to do we've got to
[1:04:23] die to our first husband we've got to
[1:04:25] die to everything that we used to be he
[1:04:28] said if you're united to christ and
[1:04:29] still married to a denomination you're
[1:04:31] an adulteress you are laodicea
[1:04:34] we're following jesus christ the word
[1:04:37] to be in the bride you have to be
[1:04:38] remarried to the word of god
[1:04:41] and as long as you hold a man's
[1:04:42] tradition of denominations you are
[1:04:44] called and god's word
[1:04:46] and adulterous
[1:04:48] as long as you're a denominational creed
[1:04:50] seeker belonging to a denominational
[1:04:52] church that denies the word you are an
[1:04:55] adulteress
[1:04:56] what the bible says
[1:04:58] why would that make you an adulteress
[1:04:59] because you're not staying with what the
[1:05:01] bible said the bible said you need to be
[1:05:04] baptized in the name of jesus in acts 2
[1:05:06] 38.
[1:05:07] the bible said that there will be
[1:05:09] malacca in malachi 4 5 6 that god would
[1:05:11] send somebody to turn our hearts back
[1:05:13] in this last day he said you can't be a
[1:05:15] virtuous bible believing christian and
[1:05:17] so you associate yourself and the
[1:05:19] denominational affair you just can't do
[1:05:22] it at the same time one has got to be
[1:05:24] dead and let the other one live
[1:05:28] how could a preacher look at acts 2 38
[1:05:30] and see that there's not a person in the
[1:05:32] bible ever baptizing those titles and
[1:05:34] then still say he's pregnant with the
[1:05:36] word of god
[1:05:37] telling you a lie he sold his birthright
[1:05:40] he's committed adultery against the very
[1:05:42] thing that he said he's put away in
[1:05:44] divorce
[1:05:45] god is going to have a virtuous church
[1:05:47] just exactly a bride
[1:05:49] now that's if that's an adulterous
[1:05:51] church what would it be to be preaching
[1:05:52] the truth saying exactly what brother
[1:05:55] branham said a a a preacher a ministry
[1:05:58] that will preach exactly what brother
[1:05:59] brahma said god is going to have a
[1:06:01] virtuous bride
[1:06:03] you look at how you go back and read
[1:06:04] this message and brother brown he brings
[1:06:06] it down holds it down so so narrow he
[1:06:09] says in one place there's going to be
[1:06:11] very very very
[1:06:13] very few saved very few that will
[1:06:17] actually go all the way so it's
[1:06:19] examining time time to examine yourself
[1:06:21] he said now take a look at a good look
[1:06:23] for a moment with your own spiritual
[1:06:25] insight at your soul
[1:06:27] look at yourself for a few minutes
[1:06:30] you say that message you're preaching
[1:06:31] brother branham is wrong
[1:06:33] look at yourself a little bit let the
[1:06:34] holy spirit search your minds with the
[1:06:36] word
[1:06:37] you'll agree with the message
[1:06:40] if you'll just listen to the holy spirit
[1:06:41] you'll agree with the message
[1:06:43] let christ the anointed word search out
[1:06:46] your own conscience
[1:06:48] let him get in let him get into you see
[1:06:50] if that's right or not
[1:06:52] amen you can't preach luther's message
[1:06:54] today
[1:06:55] you can't preach wesley's message you
[1:06:57] can't peace to preach the pentecostal
[1:06:59] message there's a message today that's
[1:07:01] being preached that is the true
[1:07:03] unadulterated word of god that will
[1:07:05] unite the bride and christ together
[1:07:09] it proves that we're the end times
[1:07:15] i'm skipping again i'm i'm trying to
[1:07:17] trying to find a place to close
[1:07:21] look in this that in this hour and i'll
[1:07:22] close in just a minute here the bride
[1:07:24] the bride knows where she stands
[1:07:28] now now you know in a marriage ceremony
[1:07:30] there's all these things that go into it
[1:07:32] there's there's there's the the marriage
[1:07:34] certificate
[1:07:35] there's the token that has to be given
[1:07:37] there's the the minister doing his part
[1:07:39] there's all through the bible the the
[1:07:42] minister was the one that introduced the
[1:07:44] bride to the groom the eliezer
[1:07:46] introducing uh rebecca to isaac and and
[1:07:49] you've got all these parts that are
[1:07:50] played and so you know when all these
[1:07:52] parts come together it builds up your
[1:07:55] confidence and your faith that something
[1:07:57] is actually taking place in your life
[1:07:59] and you can look at that evidence that
[1:08:01] there's a union taking place like for
[1:08:03] example after the marriage ceremony you
[1:08:06] can you can wave that marriage
[1:08:07] certificate around you take it you look
[1:08:09] at it it's got it's got the signature of
[1:08:11] the signat of the efficient it's got
[1:08:13] your signature it's got the bride
[1:08:15] signature everybody's signed it it's got
[1:08:17] the stamp it's got the seal and you can
[1:08:18] take that and you can look at it and say
[1:08:21] yup
[1:08:22] we're married
[1:08:23] and you can see with confidence that
[1:08:25] you're married and you see you can't get
[1:08:26] that marriage certificate though until
[1:08:28] all the requirements have been met that
[1:08:30] minister standing up there ain't going
[1:08:31] to marry nobody if you've still got a
[1:08:33] living husband he's not going to go
[1:08:35] through all that but when you get that
[1:08:36] marriage certificate that proves
[1:08:38] that the old man is dead
[1:08:40] now see and the marriage certificate is
[1:08:42] the book and so that's why the bible in
[1:08:44] the revelation it talks about the open
[1:08:46] the book is opened up so you open up
[1:08:48] that book and you can see that it's the
[1:08:50] proof that you've been married when you
[1:08:52] when the book is opened up and you look
[1:08:54] into it and now he said brother ram said
[1:08:56] now your name is now in the new book
[1:08:58] not the book of life but the lamb's book
[1:09:01] of life
[1:09:02] with the lamb redeemed
[1:09:04] not the old book of your natural union
[1:09:06] but your new bride hallelujah your new
[1:09:09] life is in the lamb's book of life your
[1:09:11] marriage certificate so the marriage
[1:09:13] certificate is the book that you look in
[1:09:16] the lamb's book of life it's opened up
[1:09:19] why did john take the book because he's
[1:09:20] taken his marriage certificate he's
[1:09:22] taken it and he ate it up and he know
[1:09:25] it's revealed to him it's not something
[1:09:27] that we can physically hold in our hand
[1:09:29] necessarily but we we
[1:09:31] we believe it and by faith we can see
[1:09:34] our name in the book we can see that
[1:09:36] we're actually just like you look at the
[1:09:38] marriage certificate there's my name
[1:09:40] there's the groom's name there's the
[1:09:42] stamp there's the seal it's all been
[1:09:44] sealed and you can look with confidence
[1:09:45] and recognize that the marriage has been
[1:09:48] completed
[1:09:49] you look in the book and that book
[1:09:51] brother adam in one place he said it's
[1:09:53] like your natural life grew up grew up
[1:09:55] until it came to a place where it could
[1:09:57] be joined with eternal life and that
[1:09:59] eternal life is your book and you're
[1:10:00] looking at eternal life and you
[1:10:02] recognize that you always were eternal
[1:10:04] not your natural life but that that
[1:10:07] eternal life that now you're connected
[1:10:09] to so you the book opens up and you look
[1:10:11] back to genesis 1 26 27 that says so god
[1:10:15] created a man in his own image and the
[1:10:16] image of god created him male and female
[1:10:18] created to them and there's your
[1:10:20] marriage certificate now now you see you
[1:10:23] grew up you grew up through your natural
[1:10:25] life and then you came to a place where
[1:10:26] you could be knighted with that and even
[1:10:28] then you grow and grow until you become
[1:10:31] one and then you can look you recognize
[1:10:34] that's why you got to be birthed into
[1:10:36] these you're you're you're even birthed
[1:10:38] into understanding of predestination
[1:10:41] when that final birth that i recognize
[1:10:43] that i always was eternal you're birthed
[1:10:46] into that now you can see where you come
[1:10:49] from and you recognize you recognize
[1:10:51] you're married you recognize that the
[1:10:53] marriage certificate has been opened up
[1:10:55] and you can see now now what does that
[1:10:58] marriage certificate say
[1:11:00] he said now he said it says
[1:11:03] where your true eternal germ from the
[1:11:05] beginning takes hold he said now
[1:11:08] you're not only forgiven
[1:11:10] but you're justified glory just you see
[1:11:12] what justification i mean you grew up
[1:11:14] that natural all growing up until you
[1:11:16] come you join together with that eternal
[1:11:18] life and then you can really say not
[1:11:20] that you're forgiven but you never did
[1:11:22] it to begin with you're justified
[1:11:26] yeah romans 5 1 said therefore being
[1:11:28] justified by faith
[1:11:30] look up the word the word don't mean
[1:11:32] forgiven the word means justified it
[1:11:34] don't mean you're forgiven what is
[1:11:36] justified
[1:11:37] now this is this is not no little baby
[1:11:39] justification we're talking about where
[1:11:40] your sins are chopped off and this is
[1:11:42] not even a little maybe step above that
[1:11:44] but
[1:11:45] you it says though you never did it but
[1:11:47] the real you never did it and that kind
[1:11:50] of justification means the real you
[1:11:53] never disbelieved god's word
[1:11:55] the real you never struggled with the
[1:11:57] word the real you never told a lie
[1:12:00] the real you never stole
[1:12:02] you never spoke against your brother you
[1:12:04] never murdered you you never were
[1:12:06] jealous you never disbelieved the real
[1:12:09] you never did why because the real you
[1:12:12] always was going back to genesis 1 26
[1:12:15] the real union and the old union that
[1:12:17] old man that's what paul was talking
[1:12:19] about in romans chapter 7 the old man is
[1:12:22] dead the old union is in the sea of god
[1:12:25] for god's forgetfulness you weren't
[1:12:27] married to it to begin with
[1:12:29] he bore your shame himself for you and
[1:12:31] your place
[1:12:33] he took your place for you we're
[1:12:35] predestinated for you were predestinated
[1:12:37] for him to be in his bride before the
[1:12:40] foundation
[1:12:42] of the world
[1:12:43] brother bob this is a little bit deep
[1:12:45] but i i think it's time for a wedding
[1:12:48] it's time for marriage
[1:12:53] now now listen he said how did you how
[1:12:55] did you come to this how did you how did
[1:12:57] you come how how did you get here before
[1:12:59] the minister with the bride and the
[1:13:01] bridegroom how did you come to this you
[1:13:04] were deceived into it by your first
[1:13:05] marriage to your adulterous parent eve
[1:13:07] it's no fault of your own
[1:13:09] by your natural birth you come after eve
[1:13:12] who committed adultery that's the reason
[1:13:14] he was born an adulteress but but he
[1:13:16] redeemed you he took you from being an
[1:13:19] adulteress to being somebody that he was
[1:13:21] willing to be married to well you talk
[1:13:24] about grace that's why you're mrs grace
[1:13:26] because the grace of god has been given
[1:13:29] to you that he
[1:13:30] he took you from plucked you up from the
[1:13:32] ditch and and put you in the king's
[1:13:34] palace he said you was deceived into it
[1:13:37] you never did it
[1:13:39] because that little germ that was in you
[1:13:42] was to be you before the foundation of
[1:13:44] the world god put your name in the
[1:13:46] lamb's book of life
[1:13:49] your marriage certificate you look at
[1:13:50] that marriage certificate and you
[1:13:52] recognize
[1:13:53] well here's what he said you are
[1:13:55] standing completely justified as though
[1:13:57] you never did it at the beginning he
[1:13:59] said this is my message to the church
[1:14:01] now you are standing if you're standing
[1:14:03] on god's word and with god's word every
[1:14:06] amen every jot every tittle where you're
[1:14:08] standing
[1:14:10] you're standing complete
[1:14:12] justified
[1:14:13] like you never did it in the first place
[1:14:17] talk about a thanksgiving
[1:14:19] talk about a thanksgiving that's
[1:14:21] something to be thankful for
[1:14:24] he said i'm more thankful for that than
[1:14:26] any i know of you are the pure
[1:14:28] virtuous sinless bride of the son of the
[1:14:31] living god
[1:14:33] every man and woman that's born of the
[1:14:34] spirit of god and washed in the blood of
[1:14:36] jesus christ and believes every word of
[1:14:39] god stands as though you never sinned at
[1:14:42] the first place he said you
[1:14:46] are
[1:14:47] perfect i i think that that that'll
[1:14:49] knock down all this idea like how can we
[1:14:52] be perfect how can we i've i've heard
[1:14:54] that so much it just might makes me want
[1:14:56] to vomit how can we perfect god gave us
[1:14:58] a way to be perfect god gave us the the
[1:15:01] recipe he gave us the the avenue he gave
[1:15:04] us the power to be perfect his power is
[1:15:07] his word
[1:15:09] why because he took my place
[1:15:11] he took my place and he made a way
[1:15:14] you see there's a marriage taking place
[1:15:15] there's an invisible union taking place
[1:15:18] where where christ and his bride are
[1:15:20] being united with the word how can she
[1:15:22] be united because all the requirements
[1:15:24] have been met that old man
[1:15:27] he said god let it die
[1:15:29] you know what that means god let it die
[1:15:31] it means it means when
[1:15:33] you know when abraham first started on
[1:15:34] his journey
[1:15:35] god told him to go this way and he
[1:15:37] started going in that direction and
[1:15:39] before long he looked back
[1:15:42] and all the idols and stuff he used to
[1:15:44] make
[1:15:45] it was gone
[1:15:46] it was dead
[1:15:47] what did that god let it die
[1:15:50] he let it die how he he took you on a
[1:15:53] journey you went on a journey and you
[1:15:54] began to put one foot in front of the
[1:15:56] other and god let it die it wasn't you
[1:15:58] that took away all that all that all
[1:16:00] that natural desire the things of the
[1:16:02] world it was it was god god's word claim
[1:16:05] in your life and as he claimed you and
[1:16:07] moved you from point a to point b
[1:16:09] god let it die
[1:16:11] [Applause]
[1:16:13] which means your first wedding
[1:16:15] that abraham down there in in the in the
[1:16:18] fertile crescent uh making all them
[1:16:20] idols that first wedding was a knoll
[1:16:23] he said you never done it in the first
[1:16:25] place there's only one thing to do it
[1:16:27] that would be god come down himself and
[1:16:29] took your place in the form of son of
[1:16:31] god jesus christ and washed you by the
[1:16:33] water of the washing of the water of the
[1:16:35] word
[1:16:36] the word
[1:16:37] not the denomination the word washed you
[1:16:41] but if you won't stand in the water of
[1:16:42] the word how are you going to be washed
[1:16:44] you're still as spotted as eve was what
[1:16:48] made eve spotted she wouldn't stand and
[1:16:50] let the word cleaner she wouldn't
[1:16:53] believe she wouldn't put all be in
[1:16:54] complete subjection to the word but if
[1:16:57] you're in complete subjection of the
[1:16:58] word you're standing completely
[1:17:01] you never sinned in the first place
[1:17:04] god don't even know
[1:17:06] it's in the sea of forgetfulness you
[1:17:08] never did it you were accused of it by
[1:17:10] the accuser but really from the
[1:17:12] beginning you were predestined to be a
[1:17:13] son and daughter of god
[1:17:15] you're standing there washed and your
[1:17:18] old book of divorcement is put away and
[1:17:20] is dead
[1:17:22] absolutely out of existence
[1:17:24] even in the mind of god
[1:17:27] why because the bride has met the
[1:17:29] requirements all the requirements have
[1:17:30] been met her old husband is dead she's
[1:17:32] clothed herself in the wedding garments
[1:17:35] she's made herself ready
[1:17:37] she is in subjection
[1:17:39] and she's got the marriage license as
[1:17:41] proof
[1:17:43] now what's the next thing in the
[1:17:44] marriage
[1:17:45] i
[1:17:45] don't don't get all hung up on the order
[1:17:47] here i know after the wedding then you
[1:17:49] sign the marriage license and everything
[1:17:50] but now when when at the end of the
[1:17:53] marriage ceremony
[1:17:55] the marriage
[1:17:56] ceremony the minister will say i require
[1:17:59] a token
[1:18:00] i got to have a token to show
[1:18:02] something's something's been done
[1:18:04] the man takes that token and he slips it
[1:18:06] on he slips that token on her on her
[1:18:09] hand
[1:18:09] to show that they're married so so she
[1:18:12] can show it's actually on display so
[1:18:14] that everybody can see it she can when
[1:18:16] she's going to buy groceries at the
[1:18:18] store she can show that token that she's
[1:18:20] married
[1:18:21] so if you're going to a wedding in the
[1:18:23] sky you're wearing the wedding band
[1:18:25] brother brown said
[1:18:26] of predestinated
[1:18:29] unmerited grace
[1:18:31] a wedding band of grace unmerited of
[1:18:33] your own amen god did it himself
[1:18:36] he give you the holy ghost he's to the
[1:18:39] true baptism of the holy ghost the token
[1:18:41] that you did you didn't do anything to
[1:18:43] get it all you did was be in subjection
[1:18:46] to him all you did was say i believe
[1:18:48] what you say
[1:18:50] in subjection and that in fact full
[1:18:52] obedience to the word of god entitles
[1:18:54] you to the token full of beingness
[1:18:56] what's full obedience the bible says you
[1:18:58] need to be born again and you were born
[1:19:00] again
[1:19:01] the bible says you need to climb the
[1:19:02] statue of perfect man and you did it
[1:19:05] the bible says you need to believe god's
[1:19:07] word and you did it that's obedience
[1:19:09] obedience is subjection not doing
[1:19:10] something that you work up with your own
[1:19:12] self but you god did it himself he knew
[1:19:15] before the foundation of the world so he
[1:19:17] slipped the wedding band on you there
[1:19:20] put your name on the book
[1:19:22] the musicians can come forward i'm going
[1:19:24] to close on that what a thanksgiving
[1:19:26] he said hallelujah praise our god amen
[1:19:29] amen
[1:19:31] when you fully obey the word in full
[1:19:34] surrender to her
[1:19:35] you're entitled to the token
[1:19:40] what grace that god has given to us in
[1:19:42] this hour isn't he wonderful
[1:19:49] to be separated from all
[1:19:51] all the old of the old man denomination
[1:19:54] all the fields and things of this world
[1:19:55] and all those things that kept you in
[1:19:57] man-made creeds and to be joined to
[1:19:59] christ
[1:20:00] that's something to be thankful for
[1:20:01] tonight

[1:29:42] going fast for thanksgiving and stuff
[1:29:45] um
[1:29:46] just so y'all know i'm not a bad driver
[1:29:48] or anything some i disagree
[1:29:50] but
[1:29:53] i was at a stop sign
[1:29:55] on my way to work this morning and i was
[1:29:58] gonna
[1:29:58] turn left i looked both ways there were
[1:30:01] no cars
[1:30:02] i looked both ways like five times okay
[1:30:04] no cars i did not see a single car
[1:30:07] so i was like okay
[1:30:09] coast is clear i'm just gonna go
[1:30:11] so
[1:30:12] um as i was going
[1:30:15] uh
[1:30:16] there was some in my head that said stop
[1:30:18] and it was so sudden i just like slammed
[1:30:19] on my brakes
[1:30:21] and it was in the middle i was in the
[1:30:23] middle of this
[1:30:24] first lane before you go in the second
[1:30:25] lane
[1:30:26] and there was a car that came out of
[1:30:28] nowhere
[1:30:29] and i didn't see it at all
[1:30:31] it just came out of nowhere and if i
[1:30:34] wouldn't have heard that voice i would
[1:30:35] have hit it or it would have hit me and
[1:30:37] it was going like really fast i probably
[1:30:39] would have died or been ended up in the
[1:30:40] hospital so i just
[1:30:43] thank god that he was watching over me
[1:30:50] sometimes we don't know where them cars
[1:30:51] come from they just come out of nowhere
[1:30:54] how many of that happened to all of us
[1:30:56] where you have a time though where you
[1:30:58] pull up to a place though and
[1:31:00] and something says don't go right now
[1:31:02] that's right stop
[1:31:05] had it happen several several times and
[1:31:07] then all of a sudden you see that car go
[1:31:08] by that you didn't see when you look
[1:31:10] five times you're right you know so it's
[1:31:13] the grace of god
[1:31:15] it's like brother bob said this thing
[1:31:17] all this is built on grace
[1:31:20] by the grace of god we get up in the
[1:31:21] morning by the grace of god we live
[1:31:24] by the grace of god we have our being is
[1:31:25] what the bible says then we're going to
[1:31:26] end this thing up with grace
[1:31:28] statue your perfect man
[1:31:31] you have something sis alicia okay
[1:31:34] okay you were just praising the lord
[1:31:35] okay jim we do need to know
