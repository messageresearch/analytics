========================================

I figured you could i we're on the steak seal this will be the last part we do for them for the time being and since I got two of the people in here what I've decided to do let's think about yesterday yes the next two Sundays Ryan's going to do Sunday school class the next two Sundays after that bottom of this let's go claim that way we're going to get to the sixth seal and I'm gonna take a little break down here we're gonna have to back up and start upstairs so I don't want to keep trudging along here but the 6-2 is a good place to stop does that seal is the tribulation seal that's the the seal of redemption redemption is over after the sixth seal is open that we know of here because it's a little tricky to say that all redemption is over on the sixth seal which it is because the sixth seal carries us all the way through to the micron judgment but the sixth seal opens here on earth to put we're in a rapture the church is going through the tribulation 144,000 is being called out and then the Battle of Armageddon and all nature is to be done away with all right that we know because remember we're going to come back into millennium and it's still going to be days times not dark I mean that day okay am i understand i might listening now nobody knows what they're talking about all right so this sixth seal and you know if we do which we won't if we do because remember remember Brethren says in the future home he says the Millennium in the sea drones to different things some things will fit in the Millennium they won't fit in a future home something to fit Blin cause remember and amylum there is still time Satan is bound the Devils are still alive they just can't work through the bride thereby all right with that one okay but he's still there but now I'll promise you if anything was to happen they would be enough sons and daughters of God there to stop it before happening okay just like eating because that's what programs that an eating condition has begun in the Millennium it doesn't end until the future huh because remember there still is time in the Millennium we still have time there I got that but this sixth seal finishes the redemption of man finishes the redemption of the earth and eventually the redemption 144,000 finishes the redemption for the well I guess you say the force I'm sorry the foolish virgin because they died with a testimony but they have to stay dead for a thousand years foolish person dies in them and you're an accumulation they have to stay there that then the Dead lived not a thousand years that's right it is blending into that time hmm because the 70 weeks of Daniel X why it's so important to bring down incorrectly the 70 weeks of Daniel is that when that dream has your message gets finished that's all there is to the Jews but now the world has got to be renovated that sixth seal continues because it's the tribulation seal it continues into where everything is destroyed everything is destroyed but now like I said before when we come back here in the Millennium they're still going to be building you don't say once and it's a nuclear war that's gonna kill everybody but the buildings will not be annihilated now that the Battle of Gog and Magog to go into the future home this is going to be wiped completely off you'll never see one speck of any of this but I believe in you see if you you see how the devil works in the mind of man all these movies of this post-apocalyptic world well that's basically what you're going to see but the evil is not going to carry open to the light we're just going to step back onto this earth and this is going to be just a wasteland but what because remember we have to build houses Tamil says we build house now wait up but whoever is left here 144,000 they got a built in temple gotta build it with something okay Ezekiel 42 44 gives yous dimensions gives you what they build it with and all that stuff okay so so we're not looking at and just walking into you and I listen you and I walk into a utopia on this side when we get a body thing okay so we're way ahead because we've got to be ahead we fell first so we've got to come back to the condition because we caused this to happen we cost the six elope the sixth seal can't open until we're gone like I said we're holding this whole thing up but this nature cleansing of you and I has to come before any of that okay Kalista see this frame stuff you have to watch this now because we have to put this we have to overlap because right here is a body change if that this is the rapture seal but we take a a body change but this right here tells us how it's gonna happen go back into the sixth seal it'll tell you how it happened and remember too that we're gonna read it here but I was reading a little bit what the Prophet said we may really have time that the sixth seal opens in a three-fold matter just like the seventh seal up which number one is what they're calling out of the 144,000 all right then it's something else and then something else all right got there so if it opens in a three-fold matter and the trumpets that's why this thing is so layered on top of each other the trumpets all the trumpet sound under the sixteenth okay that's how mysterious it's not just it's like I was telling you all the other day you gotta be you gotta watch what's going on it's the seals been broken off but it's that unwritten part that you and I have to read because what we have to do is about completing together there's nowhere in the Bible it says that the fifth seal Jew is where the ones killed under Ivan the hill because most other commentaries tell you this this is the bride or the chosen right so that's what brother Brennan thought crying how long how long but then when he comes to the fifth seal and it opens he sees that but he doesn't just see that he's if you open we're gonna get into this why need to stop hearing that fifth seal you see the word grace about a hundred times in that sermon grace grace grace well that's the grace seal the grace given so the grace of marriage and divorce was given under the fifth seal opening to me and you you hear that opening to me and you doesn't give Israel a right to have a marriage and divorce okay because you and I have to have the grace of marriage and divorce for the body change so you see how this how this comes back and gets us the Seventh Seal brings him to the earth so when it's a one seal brings him to the earth all these seals open to me and you first we get that's why I say we get the we have been chosen to get the spiritual part of this whole salmon sea okay but it's good it's open naturally but what that's the single part the one I showed you didn't want the seal but now that part that was rolled up that's the thunder when that thing opens then I was reading last night brother Graham said one seal will tire do you copy tie the entire Bible together well you can see that more now than ever okay how that this afternoon we're gonna we're gonna blend in to just even on the foundation we got to go back to the messenger coming to the end of the age what we've been preaching for years how that there's eight manifestations of doctor the church ages brother round had coming the age he couldn't come at the beginning to the end but now his message came at the beginning of the earth but not but not his message he came on the scene and then his message began we'll talk about the offenders well if those you just got here starting next Sunday I'm gonna take a break for a month or so so I can fall back if I keep talking about this y'all gonna know more than everybody else knows and I'm just gonna stop right here this is a good place to stop on this thing Steele just stop right here called everywhere you see remember I told you there was one two three four five six and there's an arrow six the the sixth chapter revelations is six seals then it goes into the what revelation 7 which is two calling out of Israel right then revelations 8 breaks the seventh seal right then you got the trumpets in Revelations 9 stop these revelation 10 comes in and then the seventh trumpet breaks the chapter after so there's always an arable there and watch how brother branham even preached six seals had questions and answers and then the seven preach six church ages and then you come in with ten virgins and you know there's a break there there's a rest time because remember God created the earth it's hot in here God created the earth in six days and then what he rested there was an arable thanksfully erased it so what we're gonna do is we're gonna riff back up and do the and trying to get it upstairs so next two Sundays Ryan is going to ditch things two and then the two Sundays after that Bob's going to do and then the two Sundays after that the Lisa's going to okay then we'll get Bella showing them some here I'm gonna give them two in a row that way if you get on Ceres and you know we might do great things so we'll see alright so but I'll be right here cheering them on but see I'm saying I'm having to think six seal down here and the foundation up there and it's okay but I don't think you get the full I want to be at my best so I want to do you know the most impactful is that and I want to give these guys some times but y'all hear me all the times that maybe one time now I'm going to kind of give you a month or two them to listen to them because we are even lluís bringing wings do not lend them and you know that just I told my brother clothing okay then we should we truly have a five fold ministry you need all five oh okay to some teaching is boring okay just tell them I saying teaching is boring but what happens is you bring in some violet Louise her Bob they're growing but they bring in a little spark in it kind of like the you need a little what is he doing I guarantee you popular kids are Aryan his eyes first they happen to that I pop open doing like this okay so maybe we need a little you know what do you feel Jonah wake up we're in the end time we're in time we have a message that way I hope y'all got that I mean Louise brought that out well so take the underlying take the onion peel oh that was for Joan we have a message that we remember brother Graham freaks running that's what brought my attention running from the presence of the Lord yeah are trying to do how to service ended up being as well you be out of these will you have a message and it just perfect but you can be out a little good but he took what Louise was talking about even on the ship never thought about that my life smart as I am like brother don't say that him being on that ship he witness to that group of people and they went home to Joppa and said look what happened to us there's a prophet among us here and that's what happened because you watch brother Branham preaching these different places he went to spending on North Carolina a little hole in the wall place weapon 2,000 people in the in the whole community and got Henry green one man all right right he goes to this when he gets one who does the making the Palmers and the one you know you have to see that that God's leaving because of these places because their seed there that's right there's children there that needs to be talked to now maybe 50 years until somebody sees it but still it's like Jonah Jonah planted to see God planted the seed through Jonah Jonah was a witness even when he listened even when he was in his error he was a witness they there was a profit on the same because you know they've gotta think off man if God thinks too much of this guy even though he may be out of the will of God if we three motor board and now the wind just quits and the storm just quits they some powerful going on there so I really enjoyed that because it it brings another layer just like these seals brings another layer of what God has for us then I don't think we're seeing but I think there's something happening in the church I don't I just Archer got my all around people talking we're talking about things that they've never talked about before and people coming in and listening and getting a blessing from it so but let's finish this seal so Ryan has got next Sunday on the next the eighth and the 15th it'll be on the calendar up here boxed up at 22nd and 29th and then Lewis well I'm gonna I'm gonna be at immune on Saturday the 4th of November and I'm staying over to that Sunday and being serviced with them somebody have to do them if I thought the least about later now I'm will be at my goal due to week of Thanksgiving so our Sunday after Thanksgiving we'll look we'll get it all straight now yeah we get it all straight down so now we have not read this but I want to read this where brother branham brings in the sixth seal in Matthew 24 it says immediately after the tribulation of those days now brother Brown makes a comment on the sixth seal he says that's the minor tribulation this is not this is not going to happen after the major population this is going to happen triple-eight tribulation of those days all right which is 144,000 to do I can't ever remember the the book is first this burden is going to be in a tribulation big time they're gonna be hunted down til millions of them's gonna be killed for the gospel of Jesus Christ okay so being you got 144,000 is going to be persecuted during that time so that is more of a pre-tribulation a brother Brown called it a minor tribulation period so this is not the tribulation that's going to destroy everything this is the tribute after the tribulation of those days shall the Sun be darkened and the moon shall don't give her life it stars shall fall from heaven and the powers of the heavens shall be shaken then we'll read revelation 6 and then shall appear the sign of the Son of man in heaven then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn and they shall see the Son of man coming in the clouds of heaven with power and great glory he shall send His angels with a great sound of a trumpet and they shall gather together his elect from the four winds from one end of heaven to the other now that's not us we're already gone okay but now remember there's a remnant called the foolish virgin and 144,000 that's still going to be here now the sign of the Son of Man was what resurrection son beside of the Son of Man is the resurrection son if I got a brother they'll taught it for years son of man is it is a science son of man is their sign that the resurrection is back but brother Bryan would be preaching and people would be raised from the dead same way we've seen people here do to prophets they're gonna see the sign of the Son of Man what 144,000 gonna take a resurrection two prophets you're gonna take a resurrection in front of the whole world right because he said all the tribes of the earth mourn and they shall see the Son of man coming in clouds cause he's gonna come and get them because remember your denominational world thinks this is their rapture okay see you see how the Satan has has diluted the word but we had a prophet come and put the cow down eating grass I mean they got the guy right they got the cow they got the grass and they got the tree but they've got it all convoluted to where the cows up in the not a pretty picture but we see where brother Adam brings all this ice wine through the Prophet took the Prophet not to rearrange the work man rearranges the work right brother man never rearranged the word to fit what he thought that's right that's what man has done they rearranged the word to what they think when our brother rounded he rearranged the word by the mind of God he didn't rearrange the word he took the revelation the true revelation and brought it back to where you and I can see for sure until there was a man told me one time he's I'll be glad when I see the Son of man coming he's quote a district with power and great glory I said it says after the tribulation of those days shall the Sun be darkened I said when did your God coming because remember all denominations believe that we have the good loot emulation all denominations believe that the bride the bride not just to church that the bride goes through tribulation which was like I said before that to me that's a great revelation to know that brother man told us that the bride if you're warning doesn't matter if you go by the grave them after they burn your body standing in the street you are going in the rapture and you will not have to go through any of that tribulations alright so that to me that's a great thing because because see that scare tactic that the denomination is used Jen's been there so everybody's been there oh you don't want to go you know we got to go through this tribulation we gotta give her a life and we're good no we're done we're protected to me that's what this seal shows this seal shows that I get my cleansing here and then efficient tribulation seal I'll call out of that the seal has done hey listen this we are going through tribulation right now all right your old nature is fighting you v me last night at one o'clock in the morning fighting me her kicking me but but you see it's the warring in my members Paul said and that's something that we've got to it's kind of settle down to where it doesn't matter what kind of thought comes in your mind that you just turn it away because Jesus was the same way hey the thought would come to his mind and he just turned off that's so simple but he hit it so hard I don't know if are a few but heart mate because you know what that thing follows me you trying to get away from that thought the best thing that there is is my brother Ram said just start singing a hymn or just you won't read the body and sometimes I don't and I apologize but sometimes autograph allow them to start reading but then sometimes I've drowned in my own pity so not a lot of oil everything's fine Tom's 37 I will read that but a stone accommodate folks when this nature cleansing will happen to a group of people and they will take a body change their body will be so perfect so pure so like the way there won't be one smell of sin and that's before all this happened naturally so we get that revelation of these seals really they're really not listening there really is only six seals that has something attached to them right I read the quote last night brother man he said really because 60 look talks about all this stuff this is gonna happen this is gonna happen this going to happen this don't happen revelations that one said they silence in heaven for how about then there's nothing else programs we don't have anything else to go on but text said what ceilings him he's running ties all this together if that mighty angel in Kimber one doesn't come down and reveal this just like he did with the property whatever cool look good just like you did for the Prophet then we're gonna miss it the seals were not just for William Brennan the seals were broke so that you and I can get it all right all right so that we can be caught up in Emily well reading this afternoon every way we were having a Bible study at my sister's house on Friday and there was a lady there that's her friend she's denominational we were talking about that why some some will go in the restaurant some won't but will they be lost you know so I was telling them I said well you know even in the nominations they they're probably they're gonna get eternal life at them but they're gonna have to go through this cleansing that's right I said but now the bride she's already went through judgment because Jesus Christ was to involve the judge and then and all that and I said but see because we have our trust in Christ and and but now you take a Catholic for example their trust is in the Pope or in Mary and use a technology of purgatory night but you and I play right so they're still thinking judgment I still think that you know and in the girls I've never seen it like that you know that but the denominational people are hungry yeah just talk to him a little bit because there's something listen so long they've been into this go to church same three hymns preacher preaches 30 minutes they don't like him two months later they kick him out get them a new one you see one come on very unsettling you brother Brown said that's what would happen and very black and white for example exactly you either go to hell or you get you're doomed or your glorious one of the table but we see the sea is so simple is always less five wise and five foolish virgins virgins this right there in the word they're virgins to the Word of God they're not manhandled the virgins been men him yelling that one coming a virgin a virgin is a virgin until she's been handled by something about by someone else then she's not a virgin anymore but these were five wise and five foolish they had kept ourselves from something but they never went all the ways to get the oil then we're blinded by false shepherds so they just are listening you're free moral agency will kick in any time and you think well I got it and that's what a lot of people you you look at their life and you don't see an experience in their life and and you think wow you just sending a message Church good you can quote you know but when God comes down and shows you something and put something together for you and it just thrills your heart that's never the devil devil will never give you joy in the Word of God he'll give you doing everything else but he'll never give you joy in the Word of God that's the one place that Satan takes it to that's why you know brother I'm saying you know he said if you keeping your mark he said Satan won't be able to get to it he said but if you speak it that's why I said what still silent silence and devil for space well half an hour and we'll get into that later down the road but we're still on the foundation we got to get a few more things on the foundation upstairs before we get to this but now let's go through this real quick and we've read that now let's read revelation six and you'll see we're seeing is actually the same thing now the hill we had opened the sixth seal though there was a great earthquake Sun became black we were indirectly just read that South o'clock tea though nothing like I stand before upstairs the Steel's have already been preached man has sealed it up and staple something else brother Branham was breaking the seal off of that that the devil had put on it that's why you see that that white horse rider is Antichrist but he's going away from you can't stand revelation that's what program said Satan cannot stand Revelation so when that seal was being broke there but that little prophet was tearing that seagull off the Christ oh I got one quote I'm gonna save but he's talking he said my message and he stopped immediately he said it's not my message it's his mess he stopped right there he said he's the people believe my message that's what he said believe my message and he stopped and he said no it's not my message is his mess you see how probably you know you and I were just four feet we broke this our head would be this big we'd be it had to come to brother and it had to come that man they had to fit his character it would have fit no one else or getting one do you want to come through that like this amen same thing with you and I you we must see all of us you messed it everybody we must see that we're called for a duty and a job and it's not to wander off here there everywhere is to stay in your job do your job and do it to the best of your ability when you see that then what when you see who you are then your people gonna see you later right cuz there's army if you're wandering around like most people in the message they wander over there and then wander over there brother round called wandering stars they wonder whether this is right they wonder whether the damage their new lease is right they all the seals and bro bro bro 19:53 because some years ago he told the sail off so that you and I can get something out of this Yeah right amen it was a great earthquake some became black as sackcloth of hair and the moon became blood and the stars of heaven fell unto the earth even as a fig tree casteth her untimely figs when she is shaken of a mighty wind and the heaven departed as a scroll when he rolled together and every mountain and Island were moved out of the places and the kings of the earth and the great men see I parallel in with Matthew 24:24 give me and the kings of the earth and the great man the rich man the chief captains and the mighty men and every bondman and every free this is everybody hid themselves in the dens and in the rocks of the mountain said to the mountains and rocks fall on us and hide us from the face of him that sitteth on the throne and from the wrath of the Lamb now who is the son of man but something God's not the Lamb of God he is but he's not in that position it said you can see the Son of man coming in the clouds of heaven well the Son of Man is the land that's me the Son of God is the father figure the father the one sitting on the throne that the Lamb the son of man took the book of Proverbs had to be a human thought they would bleed and he took the book a lamb can't take a book so they're symbolic here so you see it hide us from what exactly when it said in Matthew 24 Jesus told the son of man will be coming in cloud with great glory and they're gonna see him in right there it's exactly right behold the lamb of God who takes away saying the world now he wasn't looking at the Son of God he was looking at the Son of man it's time physically you understand physically the Son of God was inside there but he was in the manifestation of the Son of man that's why the manifestation of the Son of man has to come back in the end time God brother branham has to say behold the Lamb of God that takes once in the world just like that John did he stood and said the same thing here all right that's my revelations v is so important and see there's your gap watch this there's your seven Church ages right revelation 1 two and three are interchanging right that's why we got to come out of the church agent John for one what we're caught up right revelations five comes immediately in once revelation 6 the only of the sale so there's the interval or the gap for that breach that's modeling brother Graham preached the breach it was Revelation chapter 5 it was a breach between the church ages and the seven seals we'll talk about this effort again a little more for the ones you see something man if you you know where do you know I really don't care what you believe about breach and breach because I see something out of it cuz I went back in the birthday and I started reading the birth pains and I thought man I ain't never read this before never read that book I read it a hundred times by never not really but see that's where it's supposed to be that's like brother William that comma is two thousand that that one's not but what his illustration was that comma was two thousand years something happened that comma in two thousand years is that comma see didn't mean I see eternal Word of God because everything is put in there exactly the way we need yes all right that is great that is great right the Son of God is spirit dog okay you're back out there that is the whole ego misread son of God son of man son of David wish that we went just went through that you know right about a year ago the Son of God is what the creator that wasn't Jesus in human flesh back there but that was Jesus Christ oh the Bible says it was just right when he was in the Son of God form a spirit man okay but then that spirit God comes down to the church I mean down yeah well they had Church ages in the Old Testament you know that don't you okay then they did they had turned ages in the Old Testament brother man said they did he pulled him he put him round one Anita to me and watch John the Baptist coming in the settlement church age so that was still the Old Testament John the Baptist coming in the sandwich earth alive just showing up again - what introduced the head that'll be on the lines of ministry back on the earth to introduce the headstone same way right here same thing happen down here same thing happened up here all right everybody got that yes okay listen God's word has a continuity good if you'll just get in it get away from all this other stuff just get in it he does things and it's a pattern right that pattern just keeps going and keeps going because the first Elijah couldn't be different from the last Elijah because they're going to introduce the head the heads Christ will read it this afternoon well no I saved that from that sentence but because we got to come up to where brother Browns message is in two parts just like I showed you on the time but right in here is that revelations five that's not another Holy Spirit that's the that's the total sealing of the person because remember the revelation is five that carries us all the way do the body change because they sing a new song redemptions over when the lamb tastes above brother brown super dancing over that's why people can't understand that he's not saying redemptions over for the whole world he said Redemption over for you right nobody got that mm-hmm that's why say you got that's why I won't take it slower because there's the layers that you just keep peeling it I love onions and now let you just sit there and peel them off there but you know watch the same onion you hold it up look through it and you see the next layer you know take that layer off all right all right everybody all right so this is your state like this is the sixth seal but this has to happen to you this has to happen in a spiritual form it is to me it is a tribulation and it's going to get worse for us not better but it's gonna get better no worse thank you it's gonna get worse because the devil listen easy got everything else brother branham I was reading last night he says Satan's our serpent seed is taking over the world that was 1962 he said circle is in spoken words written see he said son this serpent see is taking over the world there's not much more of God's seed level that was 1964 because remember it's all gonna be in the minority we're gonna be a little bit of grip the darkness dealing with but guess what as God's dealing with us guess who else is gonna be there Satan's gonna be nice and he's going try because listen this is his great last this is his this is his Waterloo for here but remember he said he's very persistent and consistent because he's gonna watch us take a body change yes he's gonna watch a step-over another dimension and then he himself is going to make sure all this comes back comes remember during the two prophets that Satan is incarnate in a man called the pub and he's going to save that Eve just like when he incarnated the beast in the garden and deceived that one but see he's incarnated in that beast and he's not going to save us but we don't God's protecting this second Eve because you know what the second Adam didn't make a mistake there's not gonna add them did not sell us out he actually bought us back came in that's actually you that's where you revelation that's where you Redemption come from my husband bought us back so we're like you said we're mrs. Jesus Christ or whatever he gets if he has sustained judgment so do i but if you don't have to stand judgment we're allowing our husband on our headship which is Christ that's my brother Brown said you have a head which is your husband he said but if your husband don't follow Jesus Christ he said you follow Jesus Christ right and that's what he said you follow Jesus Christ that's your ultimate if you're a Christian now don't be foolish you know Christian everything goes out to go you know how imagine divorce coverage you don't have no coverage at all you're not a Christian you're out from under the blood you just standing there you're just like this that's why the new person most important thing because it covers you it covers everything and then you decide by your free one way to see how far you go that's right but you're definitely going to be you're sold already in that divine love because when you receive a new birth that is very love all right but the outside man because when he took that book he didn't take that book just of our soul that was the person that was the person that he bought you and I he bought us that same person no by saying I mean he bought your body at Calvary your not your literal body was Baltic Albertina right the sanctification under that seal right there was when Jesus was hanging on that cross and he said remember brother Brent said his blood be old on the earth your body was in the earth mm-hmm those who he has justified he has already in God's mind you're already glorified actually in God's mind you never fail yes what Sam do you talk no I'm in the flesh but not the one God saw a man run my life Genesis 1:26 man is so important I must look to that as McKnight's me whether you say if you or not it's me that one man that he made there was in a multiple form that was me that was me you had to worry about you but that was me that he for created form to be what come form now you go over to Polly's is conformed to his image will never look like Jesus Christ but now you don't look exactly like your mom and day yeah you have great but you're an individual so we all are an individual but we have the DNA of God running through it not to our natural veins that's no no we don't have right no but we will when we talk about it it won't be mom and daddy blood normal it'll be God Almighty in another form called the bride now how can he judge his self that's right you can't he cannot judge yourself he hears our voice remember through the blood we'll get into that a little bit later on Redemption he hears our voice even a Christian because in these bodies the Bible says Fleck this flesh and blood will not inherit the kingdom that's right okay this is dead stuff that's right this will be have to be what changed even though if you go by the grave it's gonna have to be changed into his image which is just to me it's just more and more of we got to go through this you and I gotta go through tribulation right now because the sinner did anything Bobby I'm not worried about right now I'm worried about everything I did anything but there's gotta come a time before you settled some things some things you you know you got to kick him out old nature has to die that's right like I was telling you the other day I was talking to a Christian man bless his heart he just didn't get it he's in the message but he said he said I divorced my old husband and I took on Jesus Christ I said no he's gonna be dead start preaching listo yeah they died me damn he played me the war do you paint the war
