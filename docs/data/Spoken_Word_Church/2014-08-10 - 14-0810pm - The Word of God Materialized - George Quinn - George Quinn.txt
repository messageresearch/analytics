here they live a bit far away and so we do record the messages put them on the tape for them and CDs and that's all you know but I usually stand in front of my uh my pull but you know when it's kind of comes over like this so so I can't really get you know maybe that's just as well you know and uh and it's good to remember you know I'll tell you what it's not brother Donnie Reagan preaching here today it's not brother Ronald Spencer you know it's not even brother Samuel deal it's me I am what the Lord made me and that's why I don't you know I don't want to be anybody else I really don't God bless you remember I appreciate I appreciate that praise the Lord so uh it's good that we can get right into the word of God today and uh certainly I do believe it will be a blessing to you amen yes I really believe that praise the Lord brother uh brother we had talked about you know taking off the coat you know you're going to fight but I didn't want to take it off in case he took it on me because he said that's a nice suit you know but waiting for them praise the Lord will we know that the Lord has got a sense of humor certainly we know that amen I just want to read from Isaiah you can stand with me please and uh Isaiah 55 the brothers can put it up there for you and he has such a beautiful scripture and we'll just read from verse 7 here we may and says let the wicked forsake his way and the unrighteous man his thoughts and let him return unto the Lord and He will have mercy upon him and to our God for he will abundantly pardon for my thoughts are not your thoughts neither are your ways my ways saith the Lord for as the heavens are higher than the earth so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts for as the rain come a town and the snow from heaven and return it nothing but water the Earth and make that bring forth and put that it may give seed to the sower and prayer to the eater so shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth it shall not return unto me void for it shall accomplish that which I please and it shall prosper and the thing whereto I sent it for ye shall go it with joy and be led forth with peace the mountains and the hills shall Break Forth before you and the singing and all the trees of the field shall clap their hands instead of the thorn shall come up the fir tree and instead of the prayer I shall come up the Myrtle tree and it shall be to the Lord for a name for an everlasting sign that shall not be cut off amen I would just like to quote it's John 1 and John John chapter 1 and verse 12 1 in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God Amen and the Word was God and the same was the beginning amen with God so we know that and then it says in verse 12 and the word became flesh and dwelt among us thank God when we looked at the kinman this morning he met all their credentials have he hadn't been human folks he couldn't have been working man but he was human Hallelujah and we'll say a few things about it amen this evening amen praise the Lord let us just pray gracious heavenly father when we thank you Lord for this day Lord that prophet of God taught us that said on a Sunday Lord when we come to church we honor the resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ and we're so glad that we can honor your great and glorious resurrection and Lord we just come this afternoon Lord for another helping of your word Lord you have the table spread you know what we need Lord and I just feel that some would be saying Lord let that man speak to me God may you grant that today Lord may you Quicken your word to every heart and Lord may you blessed anointed Lord let there be an unction from the Holy One today Lord and father God inspired to us for we ask it all in the precious name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen praise the Lord so we're certainly glad you may be seated certainly glad to come this afternoon amen and um what the what the thought was was the word of God materialized the word of God materialized amen and uh you you know you don't need me to tell you you should uh most of a lot of you people have been on the road a long time is not right and you've been on the road a long time and so you don't need me to tell you really but that that words are thoughts expressed praise the Lord uh they're spoken and words are things words are very meaningful meaningful and Powerful uh you know I I there will be nobody here of any age that has never been hurt by what someone said to them words have the fact they can you know if someone cuts into your sister Peggy it can hurt you amen you can really and you didn't probably even deserve it you know our words can be very uh meaningful very powerful things amen and no doubt I'm sure you'd have been loved to be not the tomb of Lazarus that day amen when uh with the tears rolling down his face he said to Marie I I am the resurrection Murray amen I am that Resurrection Hallelujah and when he said to roll the stone away people must have been my God what's he going to do here I mean what's going on here amen and he just wouldn't uh you know father I thank you you've always heard me amen and speak that word hallelujah and something materialized Lazarus who was dead came back to life again and that word that had been spoken Lazarus come forth was fulfilled amen it's a wonderful thing amen and so you know that words um come through the voice box your voice is your word spoken and you know I I I heard it that the the the gene in your DNA for your voice box as in no other animal so we were talking about Parts last night so I don't know if they have it or not I doubt it because you can teach them to speak little words can't you but you see here's where the pirate falls down amen because uh to the human language is intelligent sounds with grammar that's separates it all amen Anonymous sounds but intelligence in Words with grammar Hallelujah that's your thoughts Express his words amen today and I'm just going to run you through a little couple of things here won't take too long I'm sure Anna could do it better than I could but you know the English language amen no other animal has got that no other animal can speak with grammar no no amen and someone said well the the the the the you know when the the Beast was there in the field we know that amen but it certainly could speak because he was the next two human brother Branham said so that that was that because then he was cursed but as we know it today nigh the lion the tiger the chimpanzee are nothing no we describe our English language this is just to get you built up in a little bit we describe our English language as having 25 letters of the alphabet they're formed to make words and sentences now I believe it or not maybe if you're listening to me preaching but believe it or not a sentence is a group of words that make complete sense that's why that's why when you're talking to some young people today you having the foggiest clue what they're talking about you know hey man you know I really cool it down I mean what does that mean you know what what does that mean okay so it doesn't doesn't mean very much to me you know I think if I was really cool I'd be nice and cool you know but that mightn't be what it is you know okay you know a group of words that make complete sense and as I say language is intelligent signs brother Aaron with grammar Hallelujah grammar no I just uh no more than 30 seconds or 40 seconds see a known as a person pleaser thing okay we start off with that this is a Pulpit that is a nine because it is a thing amen I am a person I'm annoying amen okay uh George amen and I've even got it Matthias somebody was you know just in case I get lost you know or somebody asked me money amen no that's what they call the big people that make the make the ties you know okay and of course you know I come from Donegal Ireland and and that's the place so a nine is a person place or thing now a pronoun is used in a place of a known like when you would say he she or them that way and uh excuse us a conjunction also as us amen and a verb a verb a word that describes an action okay so if you say Iran well I'm sure you didn't run the church but Iran well that's a verb it's a doing word it's an action word you see I claimed or whatever that's a two in word amen no I'm a verb it's an action word and an adverb is a word that gives information about the verb so if you run that's a verb but if you're on quickly that's an adverb okay now I'm not I'm not a this is not an English lesson it's just to build you up into something you know okay amen and of course an objective a describing word it describes it you see so if you've got a house it could be a large house it could be pinned and white so that's their objectives they're explaining your verbum okay here Anna hey okay and then of course this is the last of it as I said the definite article you know used before and own amen so if you see say the door you see uh or else you can use the indefinite article and you say uh there's a a door downstairs or whatever so that's your definite article in your indefinite article amen now I wanna I wanna show you something here and I want you know brother he's looked after as well today um brother we had I want him to just come up here a second would you just come up here a second please well well just you know a couple of seconds but you know nobody will tell you believe me okay I'm sure all right that's what I want to do okay I just want to sit down well I'll do that God bless you okay thank you okay you know that that's a very simple thing to do isn't it what happened I had a thought okay my thought became a word reached over his brother wait he heard it and he responded to it in other words my thought brother Samuel materialized okay so it's not a wonderful thing praise the Lord at materialized and you know something uh the material is what it's made out of okay so when the Lord materialized to Abraham it's just brother Brahman just said he's God he can just and the the the the the the the 16 elements of a body appear he steps into it Hallelujah and he's talking to Abraham okay that's the material but when it materializes it actually happens amen so therefore when brother Branham was talking to Perry green many many years ago and he was talking about having shot the squirrel he was trying to show him how he shot this girl and brother green being brother Greenly he said either this man is a prophet of God or he's deceiving me amen and brother Branham turns around and says brother green it actually happened it actually happened well when it materializes it actually happens Hallelujah it actually happens amen and I want you to keep I want you to keep that in mind today amen so if something materializes it actually happens and the material is what it is made out of Amen now the Eternal thoughts of God you know we know that it was The Lonesome spirit amen the Eternal Hallelujah that's the way he was he was in the beginning by himself he dwelt alone with his thoughts he'll never do that again that's a wonderful thing he'll never do that again amen when you're a young mind I remember very very quickly when I was a young man we used to go to the playing fields and I was a little boy I'd be down there playing soccer and you know for the school and all that there and I didn't realize I did not realize that one day I would take my daughter down to that very Park amen and we would go brother Gary after the little Walker in the park we would go for ice cream but when I was a little boy that says I'd never realized that one day I would do that but you see the word became materialized hallelujah amen that promise of God to give us children he said and the promise he gave me I blessed your children within you so that's what he said that came to me is a promise and I knew that that was going to happen and then when it happened all them years later without realizing that that she was already in me just willing to be materialized to walk in the park so that is a wonderful thing and God was like God I know he said he'll never do that again because he's caused his thoughts to be manifest so actually which is wonderful that you and I today are the thoughts of God materialized that's exactly who we are that's exactly what we are and it's a wonderful thing amen and and why is it because God is he's fellowshipping with his thoughts Hallelujah and his thoughts as I say uh have become material and he's fellowshipping with that today and uh praise the Lord Brother Branham says here that before God could say it had to be a thought and he says and God thought the whole thing through praise God even even the way he would materialize himself down to where he could be touched hallelujah amen you know if it had been a spirit who would that little woman with a blood issue have touched have it had been a spirit floating by she wouldn't have known what to do but he'd materialized and she could touch him wonderful Hallelujah and so here he was Sunday I I were there and God thought the whole thing through well I'm glad that we haven't I looked at any man somebody great PhD or something that the smartest ever there was probably sitting would put up his hand you know because he'd been around the block a bit but you know something God himself thought it all true so what you've got is his thoughts right here what he's thought through and he's working right on schedule Hallelujah working right on schedule there ain't nothing unfulfilled that he doesn't want to be fulfilled has to be fulfilled Hallelujah and so uh there it was and I'm glad about that the Universe the creation and I don't care oh my folks you know it's just NASA NASA the other week later they were telling us that the feel that some kind of a germ or something came down from Mars and a bit of rock and here you are I mean I'll tell you what to do scratch credulity to the Limit amen you know I think in mine's filter you know that's all I am a bit of a germ or something that can done from Mars but that's they'll do that amen but God thought the whole thing through the universe creation the cherubims the Angels the planets the Sun the moon stars and you know brother Branham was asked about that and you know he said well I mean the Earth broke off the Sun and so he said but who created the Earth who created the sun where did that come from you gotta all go back there folks and when you go back brother Terence you end up with the same question who created that wherever you want to stop somebody had to make it somewhere so praise the Lord amen and you know we look at that and God thought the whole thing through he taught Redemption true he knew it would have to be a blood atonement because life was in the blood Hallelujah he knew all that and he made provision for it and that's a glorious thing you know I but the prophet says that when a a brother and sister are married and they have a little child before it's born what do they do they get a little room for it they pinned it up they put in the little cribs and all and I started to get Bibby clothes and whatever not they prepare for it and God's prepared it all for us that that you know and it's all there and it's all in this thought and it materializes as we need it amen and believe me he can he can be thinking you know Psalm Stephen said oh God I think it's on me that God you can walk into something in your lifetime and see that God was thinking about that and he made the way for you hallelujah it's so wonderful night okay right on darn and the new birth salvation the church the last things amen the Rapture of the wedding sober he started all true amen and of course as the prophet said the greatest revelation of all as the Supreme deity of Jesus Christ that he thought through Hallelujah that wow Harley was going to do it and that's wonderful because even when brother Brahman was up in Chicago and he explained that God had some of them guys came and said I never actually seen it like that amen that God the Lord God said amen that he would take that form and it would just keep coming down hallelujah amen that that's what Isaiah would have saw that's what Ezekiel Saw all these men saw that form Hallelujah because God had chosen to be in that form of the logos and then the logos became a flesh and that was his desire his purpose and he did it according to his own mind Hallelujah so that's wonderful nigh and you know even when we look at the the material substance and and it actually happens you know creation shows forth his godhead that's what it shows it shows forth his godhead amen the Eternal godhead amen and a word that is a thought may it manifest God had to think it before it could be made a word it has to be in here before I had to think that before that could become a word today see and so that's a that's just to to try and show you uh what it is he spoke the word and it materialized and isn't it wonderful that that you know when the the man in the Bible just to give you a little illustration quickly you know when they couldn't get in but because of the thong so they said well in them days you could uh it would straw roofs and stuff like that part of it and you could break that open and and so they did and they lured the man done amen and and the Lord looked at him there and he just says take up your bed and walk amen and there you have the thought of God hallelujah being manifested and materialized and the man just felt the strength and got up and walked away home with his bed under us as Matt under his his arm you see so it's wonderful the word of God always has to be materialized when it comes out of his mouth it has to be Hallelujah and uh amen the prophet goes on the center not longness every word in the Bible is God's thought letter and seed form Amen in seed form because we know we heard it this morning I think the word of God uh is the seed Hallelujah that the shepherd sold amen and so praise the Lord um amen the Potentials in the seed amen the seat is in your heart the potential is there as wonderful amen that to think that you could take a little seed out of a an apple amen and think if you plant that and it grows into a tree every last Apple it's going to be a nut tree's in there right in there hallelujah it's it's it's it's it's awesome hallelujah amen on it it means uh naturally and it also spiritually of that seed in you the word of God hallelujah gets into the good ground it will bring forth 60 and 100 fold amen and it's wonderful Hallelujah and every word of God is a seed and brother Branham says it will materialize if you let it Hallelujah if you believe it that's what he says I've got it right here amen and Christ taught us that parable of the sower and the spoken word of God is the original Saint amen so take God to this word and God's spoken word will be materialized and produced exactly what he says it will it'll materialize and bring exactly what God said it would do every seed will bring forth after its kind it's not true Hallelujah when my wife plaster of potatoes and I help her this year amen and I'll tell you what we don't expect to go back to Ireland and see a feel of wheat I mean I don't like you know and I'm just being humble and simple you don't expect to feel a weight you plant the potatoes Hallelujah and if they're going to bring up to their kind it's going to have to be batavas and we're going to have to eat them over the winter time when we love them amen because there's no there's no chemicals in them and so that's what I'm trying to say every seed so of the seed of the word of God is in you it will bring forth the word of God hallelujah it has to do it every every last time you know and of course uh you know and that's the secret folks of of a perfect faith amen I remember I was just thinking about it but the couple and you want to see the little boy he is a beautiful little boy you call him Stephen because I give him that name Stephen they still that's his name in India and I know this is a fact I know them people could not have a baby there was trouble on his side trouble on her side and I know they couldn't have a baby and so they asked me to pray well I mean anybody can pray you know if you brought me in and said look uh somebody's just died in my house would you pray I'll pray I will pray I'll tell you I'll pray but could I guarantee that they're going to raise up again I could not maybe they will maybe they won't God knows that but what I will tell you this this morning is this the next day that uh I was reading the scripture quiet times in the morning and I was reading the scripture and just right there in the Psalms it said I have heard your prayer boy that was different that changes the whole ball game as I say Amen that that prayer that you'd prayed I have heard it hallelujah sister prepare the little baby is coming and within a year she had her little baby boy and I called him Stephen and he's a lovely little fella he'll go right and lay on hands on you and all and you know I'll tell you what it's marvelous but you see that's the secret of perfect Faith you've got to get God to speak on the promise that you're looking for amen like if you were looking for a new car amen and God says I've heard your prayer you'll get your new car you know that's but that's perfect Faith there's no spots or doubts you know God said I'm gonna get it I'm going to get it Hallelujah and that's what you got to get fixed in your mind Hallelujah did God give me a promise for this particular thing and if he does hallelujah and certainly amen faith will produce exactly what God says it will produce amen so praise the Lord does the Mustard Seed Faith make me very very little but brother Branham says you stay with it and it will materialize no if I may say this folks there's two things I believe that the devil doesn't want you to do he doesn't want you to have faith and he does not want you to pray that's the two things I'm telling you he does not want it and you say oh brother what do you mean by that the devil will come and tell you that you're no good that God hardly loves you you're going to hardly make it in and maybe you mightn't even make it in and he's just going to bombard you with that kind of stuff and then you wouldn't think a Praying would you who's going to hear your prayer who are you you know and it so tries to belittle you amen until you say well maybe that's that's right but I'll tell you what if you can tell him to step back hallelujah amen and that you believe the word of God what he says hallelujah then you've got a case against him and you can press the button amen and you can say I do have faith because God says I have faith Hallelujah he said I've give you every man a Measure of Faith and even if it's the smallest faith in the world I'm going to use that Faith what I've got Hallelujah and I am going to pray Mr devil how do you like that and he don't like it he don't like it because brother Branham said even the weakest sin here today yeah there's the strongest sin there's also the weakest sin whoever that would be if you can get on your knees and pray and believe it Hallelujah God will hear your prayer absolutely and I say unto you keep praying keep praying amen never lose you know I've been prayed for my husband for 19 years listen keep praying don't give up Hallelujah under the token you can claim your loved ones I was myself it's wonderful Hallelujah and so uh let's just uh Mustard Seed let it be let there be the word materialize it's true uh where did you get the dirt Amen Let It Be me in the dirt Hallelujah every item he called him and the beaned that's what he got it and then he made it and he started the foreman hallelujah amen and so that's wonderful praise the Lord and He formed the dirt of nothing amen he just spoke it into existence because he's God that's why because he's God hallelujah he's spoken into existence amen and the Word was made by the word was made by the word of God hallelujah Let There Be begin to materialize on the very groin you stand on the night he said it's God word materialized did you know that God just said let there be he believed his own word then he the Mighty God if his American he can do all things that's why it's the third pull if he says to that uh looking for the leaves and looking for a little fake maybe to feed on if he says be cursed and he walks away you can be sure Hallelujah now if Peter holler went up an examinantly he could have said well I don't see much closer about this you know he can say that sister you know I don't see much closer by that but the next day oh he said Lord that trade you cursed yesterday look at it it's watered up see because the word of God must be manifested must be materialized when he speaks it praise the Lord so it is wonderful amen and uh praise the Lord no what is Christ The Mystery of God what is Christ The Mystery of God it's the revealed word of God materialized amen that's exactly what he heard in his mind if you read the Bible you'll see that he wanted to dwell and not form I'm not form became flesh and he's still dwelling in it the father is in me I'm in the father do you believe that yes we do hallelujahs are two or three Gods no there's not there's one God hallelujah I tell you what I heard over here I'm not even mentioning any names I heard some people are starting to preach two Lords amen I'm at that sod not sad Hallelujah that you could baptize someone who's already baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ could come back and baptize them again in the name of two Lords where is that going folks Hallelujah one Lord One Faith hallelujah or the very the very scripture that they use Hallelujah why don't they read the message and see what brother Branham said he said it's the Lord Jesus Christ in psalm 110. absolutely is we believe it amen that's who he is he's the reveal word materialized where you can touch them hallelujah amen The theophany Becoming flesh amen nine you look at his birth and that I heard it was announced and all these things you know and and you know maybe that morning when when Mary woke up I she didn't maybe just like an ordinary day but all of a sudden you know a light began to materialize Hallelujah a light began to materialize and and just as she was standing there there Step the green heart again shall Gabriel certainly we have no problem with that have you any problems with brother Branham up there in the cabin or in the cave Hallelujah where where uh he saw the light first and then he kind of felt the footsteps and just out of it stops the angel of the Lord hallelujah do you believe that would have been the same on the boat with Paul when Paul says sirs amen be of good cheer last night an angel of God stood by me Hallelujah and he said we must all be saved Hallelujah because of me amen oh it's wonderful it's awesome and I'll mention something else if I thought just in a while amen we could pack it up but anyway so that that's what it was and we knew that uh amen uh with Murray heart materialized it actually happened it actually happened amen uh we I was in one Church uh uh at the beginning of the tour and I'll tell you what I looked over and the Angels were right all around us right all around us I'll have no doubt about that today as well that the angels of God are around about their camper but those who said love God and so sometimes you can just get a little look in and sometimes not and sometimes I can see that Milky Way Cloud coming down and when that comes down I'll tell you really it's great things happen when you see that amen yes I look forward to my own congregation amen when you see that something's going to happen I'll just say this by by matter of fact just like here if anyone has a need to probably the pastor will come up with you pray for you anoint you with oil and that's correct procedure amen and the thing is that a brother came out he said brother George uh we do it this way like you say before the service he'd come up and say would you pray for me today after after the word say yes sir I need to say uh the doctor says I've got great and my this is what it is in my thumb and it's awful painful he says I've got it in my toe as well so I don't know anything about that but but I knew that away years ago they had too much meat or something you know King Henry the ethanol I'd always eat these big big legs alarm and all that chucking it away and drinking or drinking their Grog you know no wonder they were sick amen no wonder Hallelujah and you know the brother uh just you see see people really just at the close of that service not brother came out you know invaded them out he came over and you just feel the presence of God hallelujah and you know when you really feel it like a little baby this morning when you really feel the presence of God you know it's possible hallelujah it's very possible and so uh we prayed for the boy and uh amen oh that was it Hallelujah and we we went outside and we were talking to him I was just talking about something or other and he said you know brother George I knew when the prayer was made I knew I was healed that's right and he said you know I just come out here and I was wagging my thumb and I couldn't feel a thing wrong with it amen and he said and there's no pain in my toe no pain in my thumb and I said and brother I'll tell you what if I was you that's it Hallelujah if it tries to come back I don't want you I'm refusing you go to somebody else amen and you know a couple of weeks later we had a visitor in and she come out for a prayer and I'll tell you what I said you know sister this will do you good and so brother Andre sits close to the front and I said to him uh Andrew have you still got the same testimony but five weeks later he said yes sir Hallelujah still got the same testimony still holding the healing amen and that's a wonderful thing amen that's a wonderful thing amen so praise the Lord amen I would say Paul would enjoy this today because he preached amen uh the I said I preached the mystery of Christ amen that's what it all is that God the whole plan of Calvary everything and God's mind was materialized in Christ and therefore he's given him a name above every name hallelujah amen and that that all all the promises would dwell in the sun because it pleased the father and it was the son that created everything like that and he said without him and Colossians was nothing made that was made Hallelujah so I know that to be the truth praise God I'm sure you do too as well amen hallelujah amen I and they're a real word of God always materialize manifests itself and even if you could just say this at this point amen the bride had made herself ready Hallelujah well there had to be a bride to make herself ready as I've told you I don't know about often but you know if you were passing a church and and you saw a bride already you think oh there's a wedding going on but if you got closer and said oh I know that girl who's shimarian and they said we don't know you know and you say what you don't know yeah well she's only hoping that somebody's going to come and right you know you don't go into marriage like that you know that I know that okay so the bride has made herself ready because there is a wedding to go to Hallelujah she'd made herself ready hallelujah what is it it's the revealed word of God materialized lovely to go wrong as I've been a honor and privilege to me to go around the world and meet this woman that's a lack lady called The Bride of Jesus Christ Hallelujah that is so wonderful amen well let me just go on a little bit more amen not actually sure we'll start it but I'll not keep you too long today hallelujah amen because this morning a little bit older amen okay so he talks about Elohim Amen in the beginning was Elohim and Elohim became the word and the Word was Elohim this is what he says it's the same thing unfolding like an attribute you see in God I'm not your British your thought and God in the beginning the Eternal he said it wasn't even God there was no angels to worship them then and I he's just Eternal and then when he created amen he wanted to become material and what did he do he spoke the word and the word materialized that's the whole picture from Genesis to Revelation and brother you can spin a whole time it'll drive you to the word of God I know lot when you think right through the scriptures Hallelujah like uh what about the Red Sea you know and it's it's closed it's there they're trapped Hallelujah a pharaoh I'm going to butcher you people that's what I'm going to do and and and poor Moses the people all weeping and willing and and and Moses you know crying under God and God says to him why cry Moses speak Hallelujah get on that rock there and you just talk to that sea and see what happens amen and what happened the word the reveal word for that hour materialized I've not seen one Pike is that right hallelujah amen Elijah on the mountain amen I'm not going to go in it but think about it yourself Hallelujah there's all the prophet cutting themselves and whatnots and he said Lord I built this altar according to your word you told me to do it and I've done it and he stood back and the fire fell Hallelujah that said the word of God materialized the promise that he got it materialized hallelujah amen and you know Alicia on the throat and all that there and the guy says he said uh tomorrow uh make the ditches like we heard I think someone said it about someone praying for food and only there was the plates I know certainly that uh that that great man that had the orphanages uh he did not he was thanking God all I'm not lorphins hungry for their breakfast coming up and he's thanking God for the food Hallelujah and right there in the end people were bringing the food they they got convicted and delivering the bread to the orphanage amen and he's already thanking God for something that wasn't there see that's the way God does things that's the way he Reveals His word amen and that's the whole picture and Alicia said there's no water there's no rain and Allah Alicia says Mick the valley is full of ditches he said you Chrissy sometimes it is like that with God are you crazy Hallelujah you really believe that yes we really do believe that Hallelujah you know we're in Believers today did Jesus really walk in the water or did he walk on a Sign by and came in amen I tell you he walked in the water the Bible says sister he walked on the water Hallelujah and that's what he walked why do you think it would be hard for him do you think Autumn walked in the water thank you for that one all right amen think of that one okay no I hold on so it's wonderful Mick there was no water but the ditches were full of water Hallelujah the next day amen they said if there was Windows In Heaven There the Detroit wouldn't finish like that but I'll tell you the rain came amen and the the ditches were filled you know and King David anointed them anointed uh King hallelujah boy what did he have to go through before he got me a king amen but I don't believe he ever dirted it Hallelujah even in his lowest star just where death was composite of a bite where they thought I'm nearly dead here but still that little spark that two percent Hallelujah of life that was endiven amen says you've been anointed king no lovely this this encourages me too here's Paul and Paul the words that he said the angel said every man if they listen to you they'll be saved on that boat well they were and then Paul goes over and they're trying to get dry and and they let a fire and Paul gets some wood puts it there all of a sudden a Viper comes out and and they stand back and say oh boy he must have been a bad boy he's a dead man and then they're looking and they're thinking well he ought to be actually dead you know I know they'll go a little bit longer I understand he's a god he's a god he's not the man you know and that's the way the Heathen will do it amen but listen you see the devil could not change God's program and God had said to Paul you must appear before Caesar so I don't care what the devil says what the devil does he cannot change God's word God's word must be materialized and Paul did appear before uh Caesar amen so it's wonderful and if you look at the Lord you know I go on and on you know the first miracle water in the wine Hallelujah the word materialized what have you got these big Firkins you know well just fill in the water and I well you know that's our skin a lot isn't it but you know something God is able to raise up the stones to be children of Israel Hallelujah I've never got that far brother Samuel where I prayed that and not only go I'll say Lord would you raise up a few stones to come to church with us you know but I'll tell you what amen that's the god of the Bible where the water can be changed in the wine the word materialized when he fed five thousand people I remember one time when we were young Christians we didn't have much money and and a number of people came to the house and I remember my wife saying she said she come into me she said George I haven't got enough here she says there's not enough I said what have you got she told me what she had a loaf and a couple of bits of harm and whatever not and I said I'll tell you what you do just make up the sandwich into bringing them in and that's what she did and do you know something at the end of that I forget how many people were in there every last one of them were fed I'd had just you butter just you keep buttering I you know let God do what he's going to do Hallelujah that's our God that's a supernatural God in our midst doing Supernatural things Hallelujah where we couldn't make the need he made it made it for us Amen brother Terence amen so praise the Lord and you know ah the Widow of Nair and her son being raised amen you see the the word of God materialized amen just touched them and come off like all Clarence Cleveland you know what this breaks up there and at Jeffersonville you know it's all right brother boy you'd be surprised can you imagine that man had to pour all the oil in just to get the Jeffersonville into his brakes and it was just leaking the brakes hardly working amen and then the sister got sick and brother brought him at the end of the service goes over and he said you folks were at the meeting yes sir and he says is everything okay well we have a bit of problem what would that be you know and he said well the bricks aren't working that's a good problem you know I've made that run over from Jeffersonville uh two two two uh to where they lived in North Carolina and I'll tell you what some of them rules I would not like to go down even in the interstate without breaks okay you know so anyway and and here's the prophet of God is he going to pray a big great big prayer brother Aaron no he just topped him on the shoulder and said it's all right brother did you hear what I said there that the bricks aren't working and we're all just running out the end but it hurt he'd hurt and you know Karen's capped that car for years and years and never needed to get the seals for the oil or whatever we had gone never needed it amen because God is able Hallelujah that boy was raised amen I praise the Lord we've seen that that dear lady that was uh I she's this is in great form over in India Hallelujah she's still living now folks she wouldn't have been living within 12 hours of that prayer she would have been dead and in the cemetery today and I mean this I'm serious because she was as cold as ice and it was 40 degrees she was red out in the open on a little Veranda on a little cot and she was as cold as ice Hallelujah and the brother told me the year later he said the minute you left the rubber hand he said I saw her jerking that's the first thing that happened to that woman and three days she was unconscious Lander out of the hospital to give her up a nurses land there fix me for the cemetery I'm ready to go my time's up a nurse is lying there and don't ask me why God spurred her but he spared her that is thus saith the Lord hallelujah he spurred her the word of God was literally materialized to bring her back to life and see it today and that's why when we pray for the children Hallelujah so many children over in India have got uh temperatures amen and and and things they got there either they're burning up but every time we've seen the little children settle down and be healed seen it all the time folks amen and the little girl of the Dell hopes is much much better hallelujah amen for that the word of God materialized amen my the seraphenician's daughter Lazarus you could pick out your own ones there's many of them where the word of God was materialized amen but I want to change it around a little bit just for a moment we're getting on fairly good two 12 year old boys okay one 12 year old boy he's very excited he's gone up to the temple the temple of God this house shall be a house of all Nations a hearts of prayer be my host it'll be the place where I'll put my name Hallelujah and he's going up to it and there he's with his mother after the custom amen and when many days were fulfilled and they returned the Child Jesus tarried behind in Jerusalem and of course they knew it not and verse 44 they supposed to come to being with other company went a Day's Journey and then they sought him among their Kinfolk and acquaintance when they phoned him not they had to go back to Jerusalem you know that and see they sought for him quite a time they never did think it'd be in the temple but maybe if they had a sat there and thought about it they say where would he where would he gravitate to you know you know because he was 12. and of course they came around to the temple at the end and that's where they found them talking to the doctors and the of the law amen and these great Scholars of the law and they were Marvel and not a 12 year old boy could ask them such questions how and it was wonderful and then of course the mother there's always a Humanity always a Humanity God knows it he knows as well as you do and as well as I do we are human beings we're subject to the things that befall mine amen and so maybe she did scold them I don't know but she said she'd been worried and she said uh I wish you not he said to our that your father and me were looking for you and he corrected that right away he said I must be about my father's business amen see the spoken word of God and Messiah had materialized Miriam the spoken word of God I'm material and I Hallelujah I gotta do this I got to be here this is my father's house and I'll come back to it Hallelujah when my Ministry starts up amen it was wonderful praise the Lord now I Mock You it okay praise the Lord you can go into so many things but listen let me just get you right into here amen praise the Lord see brother Branham said this he said God is in all inspiration he said Do you believe God is in all inspiration and his congregation says amen so you don't be afraid to say Amen if you believe that amen because God is in all inspiration amen praise the Lord you see all scripture is inspired by God or God breathed and that's what I want today that's what I want for myself that God will breathe over me today Hallelujah nigh so the scriptures inspired hymns of inspiration past Me Not O gentles you know no matter what else you can say it's inspired praise God it blesses your heart amen and the things we were singing today like that first song if I can help anybody you know just one of them old songs inspired Hallelujah wonderful amen and and listen about sermons inspired folks if you really want Holmen give yourself even a half a day to write down what brother Brahma has brought to you that you would never know before I tell you you would Marvel at what he has actually brought to us you would Marvel at it Hallelujah from from Faith the substance amen faith is the substance the substances I believe it Hallelujah I believe it hallelujah amen and I'll tell you what right down to the communion the last message all them beautiful things and and between the ages and the seals Hallelujah we believe that that's to accept the Lord yes we certainly do amen and I'll tell you when it comes to the cloud and all these things we believe it stuff saith the Lord that's what a prophet said he saw and that's what I believe he did see Hallelujah if he was here this morning he'd be something he'd be saying Amen brother I saw it Hallelujah I saw it because he was a prophet he could go forward in time he could go back in time he did it both ways Hallelujah because that's what he was a Seer a prophet amen all these things nine it was inspired Hallelujah and you know if I said something today to inspire you that you're going home happy tonight Brother Gary sin wow I like that that just got the red in here you know that's a blessing to me do you know something it wasn't the little Irish guy that inspired you it was God because you see it's God is in all inspiration just that he used his lips Hallelujah to do it amen now praise the Lord he certainly is amen listen to this I talked about 12 year old boy now I'm going to talk about another 12 year old boy Hallelujah when was it written 1932 no sir it was written in 1965. when all these things that he was supposed to have done all the lies he's supposed to have tell and all the immortal life you're supposed to have lived and yet of all he wrote this 40 years before 65. and it's going to be fulfilled that year no all friends just look at Abraham and you will say that no matter how many mistakes you make praise God God will always protect the gift that's in you amen and so he said I wrote a little poem something like this I just think about I was 12 year old standing there up there the other day looking up the canyon thinking see and he says you know God has to read a song do you believe that God's an inspiration and he certainly is amen and in this poetry watch see come to pass sitting there a little kid with a borrowed sheet of paper and he was about he says I was about only 12 years of old say two 12 year old boys amen and here he is and he writes these beautiful words now I know I don't believe that that boy actually in his own uh ability could have done it but I believe God give it to him Lane by Lane and you know why but returns I believe that because God was going to every land that God gave her that he wrote God was going to fulfill it 40 years later every line hallelujah amen and he's you know that even even the the woman on the bus told them that he was uh you know you you've got a gift amen I can tell you when you were born in a ring and he said oh lady how I'm not into that you know yes and he told me he's born in April amen he said that she said that to him and and so and she said also she said you you'll never succeed in the East like the West you'll bring success and that's the way it was that that God dealt with with Moses in the desert and that God dealt with Paul 13 years or whatever it was uh three years and one place and whatever to get the Revelation I mean you really the book of Hebrews and there's no human being could write it down that's written down there it is perfection hallelujah it's uh scripture compared with scripture and shown you what it really means a wonderful wonderful book and Paul the Apostle wrote it by Revelation he got it all revealed to him amen and so here he is and he says I'm Lonesome oh so lonesome for the far away Southwest do you know when he's about 19 that's where he got over to he got over to Arizona he worked on the runs he loved it Hallelujah and he said that's what I'm not so far he's only 12. he's only a kid and yet of all he's lonesome for this to happen amen he said where the Shadows Fall the deepest or the Mountain Crest say 10 o'clock in the morning there would be no real Shadows falling over the London Crest you know the sun would have been up Hallelujah we've all been light and bright amen see so he's telling you something here it's going to be in the evening when this happens okay Hallelujah and he said uh you know I mean the brother of you read the book there but the supernatural labor brother Branham you know he said he could hear the coyote but he said he wasn't hunting coyote that day he got his eyes on something else Hallelujah and he said that I can see the lurkan coyote around it was you know in the evening time the Grand Canyon had the privilege to be in the Grand Canyon and uh it was we got right through into the evening time and to see the Shadows falling and the colors all changing right before your eyes it's a beautiful sight it's a very beautiful sight amen and here is the the the the colors coming down amen the Shadow's fallen and then the Purple Haze he can see a coyote over there but I'm not hunting coyote darne he can listen and he'll hear a little ball whoa you can hear the Lobo amen where the long horns of grazing see and he's going along here but he ain't looking for amen the Lobos he's looking for something else all day they've been trapping a lion all day and folks this ought to be scary to you you know if God doesn't know what you're going to do this week he's not God okay you know what I mean and he's layered out many things for you Hallelujah and if he's let out something for you you'll not miss it don't you worry about that that's why you say oh brother would I be in the Rapture really and he's LED that out for you you're going to be there Hallelujah don't you worry about that amen that's his Department no and so here he comes up and just as he's gone up you know uh old Dawson really and they went out that day and uh you know Dawson he's he takes the dogs up this way and brother Brahman goes into this Canyon and he's gone along and then he hears what he wanted to hear all day they've been tracking it brother uh Samuel and all of a sudden oh he heard the lion Wayne why am I and look what he says here he says I'm sitting right there on that Canyon and that lion is looking at me straight in the face 40 years after God gave him that Vision that little poor and here it is being fulfilled word for word letter for letter hallelujah praise God you know they say Annie Oakley was a great shot she could put with a murderer and you know what I got there and you could later match in somebody's hand and she could shoot it at 50 yards or something she was that good a shot but I'll tell you what see see right there brother Branham could have stood with his back leg got and put that rifle over and shot that land you know why I say that because God had given them that land they could give him the bear they could give him that big animal with the 42-inch it's the same thing but what I want you to notice is that that as God in charge it's what what God promised him is fulfilling it Hallelujah in other words the word of God has been materialized Hallelujah and it's wonderful Hallelujah and you know if you listen to the tip of mine running from the presence of God that's where he speaks about it amen and you know uh here he is 40 years later I'm sitting there right at that Canyon looking at that mountain in the face he said oh God he said there has to be a line beyond the river Hallelujah somewhere friends he said it's just got to be there there's too much speaking of it amen too much speaking on so what's so wonderful praise the Lord are these things myths are they just a myth you know the Irish I've got a lot of myths you know and they do and and you know are they myths praise God they're not they're realities they're real Hallelujah but materialize it really happens Hallelujah it really happens and when you look at our when you look at Moses 40 years in the desert Hallelujah thinking well it's all over I'm just going to be an old man here brother dick I'm going to die and that that said be buried up here that's the word I'll never hear of the last of me but you see God had different plans amen God said to Moses and you remember this God said look where are you standing he said well this is horrible I'm up here he said you'll bring the people right back to this one I tell you I'm God loses and you'll do it all them captives Lord all the capitals you'll bleed the murder of Egypt and you'll bring them right back here and you'll know what I said is the truth and did he do it he's certainly that hallelujah praise the lord well amen it's wonderful amen praise God yes and he says amen he says uh wow he said over there he said there'll be no more separations no more sickness will live forever amen our death or none of these things and trouble will be nothing to us you know it's it's a wonderful thing when I just wrote this message out that that man has always wanted to fly you know even some of them have killed themselves as you well know trying to strap on wings and all and Dave off the the cleft and that was goodbye to them you know you know man has always wanted to fly he certainly has you can still see it today you know man if they could just get mine flying out there you know oh my my mind has always wanted to do that praise God and man has always wanted to walk on the water you know could do something that I could actually walk over the water you know and science is a great thing but they've never done anything they got yet amen and man has always wanted to live forever you know no matter what kind of rascally is he finds it very hard to think that one day I'm going to die you know what I mean and that's why I feel so sorry for these people saying well a little bit of a germ came down from Mars and a bit of rock and here we are the human race where does he go when he dies he goes under the grave hallelujah amen and I'll tell you what as the brother Branham said it's easy to get in it's a bit harder to get out amen but amen that's why we've got to have the Blessed assurance Jesus is mine because we know what we get in hallelujah it's thus death the Lord he never changes word we'll get out of it for the dead in Christ will rise wonderful Hallelujah well we will fly you know people and then and this is why I'm brother where I'm serious here you know that you're coming to Ireland you know I wish I could everybody that wants to come say come come we'd never be able to look after you all you know it's number one but wouldn't it be wonderful Hallelujah that when you get into the Millennium brother Terence you'll say I think I'll go over and visit brother George today Hallelujah and you'll travel on a thought that's what the prophet said amen I believe it with all my heart oh my heart Hallelujah you'll travel in a thought and you'll be there Hallelujah it's going to be wonderful and I'll tell you what when you can do that brother and sister Walking In The Water it won't be so hard you know what he taught us you know I mean this is only a message today when you know what he taught us Adam and even and you know uh dear could you move that tree a little bit closer or whatever a little bit more certainly honey you know what right there was done hallelujah what a time it's going to be when that spoken word is in your mouth hallelujah what you say it'll actually be accomplished wonderful and you will live forever amen it's not going to be like this you know what brother Branham said if if God said to you look I'll tell you what I'll do I'll give you as much money as you want as much gold as you want you can be the richest man in the world if you want and you can live for ten thousand years and do whatever you want he said wow that's a good deal but I'll tell you what happens when you get to the 900th and 99th year and the 12th month and the last day of the 12th month if you're going to die at the end of it Hallelujah that was a bad deal amen but I'll tell you what when you say I'm going to live forever oh brother and the same God that showed that Prophet that lion that's the same God I'm talking about today he ain't not dead Hallelujah it doesn't matter what critics may come and go the devil's a liar he's always been a liar he's come to kill he's come to steal he's come to destroy but Jesus said I am come that you might have life and have it more abundantly and I believe in Abundant Life amen I really do okay nine Hallelujah oh yes the visions of brother problem you know Brothers spoke about Visions I'll not give you too much longer but he did speak about visions and he said you know he had division the vision would materialize in front of you just like the radio just like the television you know you see some guy in a studio and he's getting his photograph for her there's a camera right on him and he's talking and you could be a thousand miles away and you're listening to him right as he says it Hallelujah you say is that him it is him it is him amen but he's over there wait that's still him and it says voice say so it is wonderful amen and he said the Visions just like that he said God if God uh calls you to do it he'll prove it and so amen and hustle materialize he says Visions materialize in front of you just like God and he said I may be at home walking through the house thinking of anything and and maybe sit down in a room and then there'll come a vision amen thank God for that thank God for that and you know uh I remember we brought her away we'd met brother away before he died and this dear little sister wife and the nice thing about it was we had them in our home and not there and uh he'd been raised from the dead as you know in in Jeffersonville but you know one day Broadway presented himself in the prayer line and you know something this this is just like the little woman that's asked for the daughter you see she wasn't going to take no for an answer that's just the bottom line she wasn't going to take no she was going to get her she knew this man could heal my daughter and I ain't leaving till he's done it that's about to say to it he could call me a dog he can say whatever he wants I don't care I'm gonna wait until he says the right thing so brother brother weighs in the line and brother Branham is praying for the people and whatever not was there there may be more praying but it comes up the broad away he says I want you to have a vision well you know something brother brought him of course that that catches you you know as I always said that faith in God you know if you want to bring a reaction from God you believe sometime and I'll tell you if he doesn't react yeah he's not God he'll always react to Faith who touched me he'll always react to it always with that kid you never know way that he will not react to Faith and so here's brother away I want to have a vision and that caught brother run him so he turned on he went under the microphone and he said you know people put away here's he says just asked me to have a vision he said you know people he said I just can't do that he said I just can't say oh y'all have a vision for brother we're here you know oh there you are he said I can't do that you know it has to be from God and he says I can't do it and then he just turned around he says but wait a minute I don't know right away and he says you will go to Israel but not yet that's exactly what he wanted to know what the man wanted to know that day when he was going to go to Israel would it open up would it be God's Will and there's the prophet giving them the answer but he said I can't you know I just can't have a vision of you going to Israel but you see because the man was persistent he expected something and he got it Hallelujah and that's what it was so the Visions are like that amen and you know when brother Branham saw the vision it had to be materialized to be fulfilled exactly amen the way he saw it in the vision and there's that story it's a great story I I more than one time it happened where he was praying with Denver to a house a young couple a little child lying in the bed dying amen blue in the face can hardly breathe and brother branham's just marching over and praying for it you know and it gets worse I mean if it's one flick away from Death that's it right there and he packs off and thinking and the people say oh brother economies got worse you know is he going to die and I don't know and hold on there's something not right here and he just quiets himself in another room or whatever and you know then God just reminds him what was the vision and he looks at the vision again and he sees an old man come in with overalls and a straw hat and he sees a woman with a coat on and a little hat on and they come in it was the grandparents and they had to be standing in an exact place Hallelujah and he wit it and the door knocked and they come in Hallelujah and when they stood in that place that prevalent all that child I'm praying Hallelujah and I was healed right there screaming right there and then hallelujah give me something to eat and they said give her something to eat or give him something to eat you know this is not fallacy folks this is reality Hallelujah this really happened and it really happens amen when you see all the things that are going on learned all about us amen and so thank God for that amen see the vision had to be materialized just as it was shown amen and that's what we're told though the vision taree yet shall it be brought to pass amen it has to it has to materialize everything that God spoke his word has to materialize amen and praise the Lord I'm just gonna start winding down for you now amen praise the Lord can you imagine can you imagine if you'd have been there with Jesus that day just like today see and here's the Lord preparing for the Passover and he says to two of his disciples let's say James and John just for the sake of it James and Johnny says okay boys we're giving the the we want we need we need this Passover house tonight this room and he said so I want you to go and get it okay Lord sure give us a list of uh motels or whatever not we'll get your room you know no problem no no don't work like that he said I'll tell you what I want you boys to do so you go into the city that's it anybody can walk into the city you can walk down the road so okay he said what do we do then Lord he said okay you'll come to a place and all of a sudden a man will walk in front of you and he'll have a pitcher of water follow him amen and when you follow him you'll see the cult tied hallelujah amen at this real loosen and bring it to me on if the master comes and says what are you doing with a coach just tell him the master has needs of them and he'll give you that go ahead and you bring him here and that was when he was going to go into Jerusalem okay can you imagine that I mean there's not one of us here that that don't believe that we do believe it you see we believe it exactly but it's not wonderful that God comes under the realm of the materialized the word that he's speaking you go this model come there he is and he's materialized that man probably where the picture didn't realize he was fulfilling God's word but he was Hallelujah and the Lord has seen his sister and here he comes and you go well you know but I brought him talking to Dawson he loved Dawson really because I'll tell you why because Dawson never credited him out he come tired after the meetings you know just wanted to relax a daughter someone meet him at the house pick him up take him away and that night brother Branham would be there make him the coffee make him a supper good night brother Brown and God bless you good night brother Dawson sleep on and he'd be let out for a day or two and then it started coming right and he'd start telling about the meetings but Dawson never crowded him never asked him until he was ready to talk about it and so when he got his new Dan I was over there in Tucson and the Dan as a matter of fact there's a if you ever go over there there's a book on Columba and we don't need it that many years to that uh over there and brother brought him stand in Tucson Arizona I believe it's still there okay brother George give me that lovely big painting of the the cabin and an exchange so that was wonderful and so here we were amen and he's talking about Dawson and um they were asking Dawson you've got so many guns what ones will I put up Dawson what do you think and you know they were looking at this and the next thing is he says um let's go he said no before they went to it he said you know brother Dawson he said ah did you ever hear of a a certain type of gun or whatever and thought she said yeah yeah he says uh I think it's a chat gun or something I got her Belgium or whatever whatever country he said yeah that's straight brother Dawson not not you know exhale 45 that's where it comes from whatever the name was you know and Dawson's all you know that's wonderful you know and he says to him well you know brother Dawson now this is only dance before he he's departed only this before brother brought himself the sea and he said you know brother Dawson he said you know people send me gifts and he says sometimes they make it Anonymous he says in other words they don't think I know who they are I tell you what I remember and I'm only saying this but I'll tell you what folks and I I'm glad I can say it because I had a dream of brother Branham and he was in the Stream I'll not tell you at all but he's going around shaking hands you know so I had kind of notes like this or whatever and I kind of spill them just as he was coming up to me and when I got left in the notes he had gone past and I said oh my I said I can't have that you know you know so anyway I'm wearing and he turned around again he's coming back I said I'm not going to miss it this time and and so brother combine his shaking hands and and shaking hands with him he locked onto my hand oh dear and I knew right away and he's there and I knew right away brother brother we had I said this man's gone through my life just like get up and he's going through my life Hallelujah and he was he was and I'm standing there brother Samuel what's he going to say to me you know and he's got to lock tight here and he turned around and he committed that and he says brother there's nothing wrong with your character wonderful and I've seen say the same to you today if you can lock onto your hand and he said brother Dawson he said they don't think I know but I do and you know so here they're going to turn to a Mexican restaurant lunch came back up brother was out somewhere like in another room and then knock him the door this is the what is it they call it up or whatever it is the express or Federal Express whatever and the guy hands over a package and Dawson's got the package he says I think I know what this is you know it's exactly the same gun that he talked to him about two hours before here it was a raven here it was materializing hallelujah amen and all that Dawson really could do maybe you do to see him today when you see that brother deck right in front of you hopping all you can do is go what was that amen what was that and that was Dez before he departed folks he never lost it Hallelujah I don't know if you've ever seen it I don't see it you know too often today but I know they've got it still up in Jeff years and years ago you'd open one of the books and you'd see where brother branham's casket was just before they loaded into the ground after their lord and then actually someone was just taking a photograph of say that and you can see where the puller of fire the ship of the casket all around that casket was but I don't see that picture anymore I did see it up on Jeff but I don't see it in any other books anymore but I'll tell you what there it was amen and it was wonderful hallelujah praise the lord well Amen Let me just uh finish off you know praise the Lord when you look at the Lord talking to them the disciples to find that man and he'll lead them to the cult amen but what about the squirrels I mean what about the squirrels hallelujah it's given to you how many do you want amen God's God I you know you know the story I don't have to linger on an amen you see but but see God prove all things I said Lord if that be you and this is your sign that you're fixing to change my Ministry amen uh let it come to pass amen and I stood there a little bit what did he say he didn't say pray he said if you say with your words it will materialize say to this mountain and it'll just do as you say well this little bride's marching on in the light of God and every day we're getting closer and closer to these things they're getting more real to us where we're speaking the word hallelujah and we see it materialized see something happen because you said something praise the Lord and I'd love to think that even today that some way I'd say something that it will materialize real in your lane is real in your life amen praise God it's wonderful amen and and I praise the Lord you know the believer he's in you now he's in unite you are his underbridge if you've got eternal life your life always was and you was God's thinking the color of your hair whatever you are you was God's thinking and you just materialized that's all even the color of your eyes you know uh we know all about that about they talk about DNA's of us the new God Amen but you know something ahumid the DNA amen just a simple question brother who made the DNA I know the words okay brother brought him experience it in other places but chemicals how the color of your eyes is and maybe he says this a plus B minus uh zelders only God that together will give you blue eyes amen well who put that formula into your DNA who put that formula into your DNA say hallelujah it just didn't happen you just didn't happen you are you you're the way God Made You Hallelujah the way God wanted you to be absolutely so it is wonderful and I'm just going to learn as quick as I can here I've got very little more yeah just a little bit Hallelujah okay brother Samuel just for five more minutes or so okay thank you praise the Lord amen that's all there amen and it's just God's seed materializing in you amen that's all it is amen no I praise the Lord and we are that predestinated a seed of God Amen like like the prophet said Nathaniel when he came face to face with us the way we can fish to visit when brother brought him amen and and the Lord says Ah an Israelite and whom this new girl and you know uh I want to tell you a little story here if I may but you know it that that completely wrong for it nathania he didn't expect that you know how do you know me Lord and he said I saw you when you're amen you're the king of Israel it's just because I said that well what is it if you see the son of man or standing in the descending amen you see and I tell you what it's so true ah I was over in Indonesia and we went into a had a meal together with the assistant pastor and one of the deacons and uh so we went he said to the to me would you like to come around to my house and have some coffee well I didn't turn that down you know sister I didn't turn nothing so amen and I said sure I'm even running to his house and you know I I'm sure he would appreciate this like but his little boy maybe about 11 or so he was a very unruly little boy he was lapping over all the furniture and he was he must have thought he was the Lone Ranger or whatever because he was shooting everybody amen he was shooting me and he was shooting his mother and father and I think that movie was shooting it you know so uh you know he wouldn't he was really jumping over the furniture and knocking stuff over and bang bang bang you know so I was looking at him and I said tell me I said that what's your name my name's Paul or whatever it was bang bang bang you know I said is that right so I never even thought about this you know so until it all happened so I said hey come a minute he said yeah what do you want you know I said have you got a girlfriend and right from that moment there he was right in the middle of my mind all the all the buying and stuff he altered the guns yes oh yes I said tell me that's a little girlfriend you've got what's her name Sylvia you know oh so you got a name I said tell me you're saying he's right here now he said tell me I said does she know that you can a sweet on her you know no do you not think I knew he was going to say that because I was mean to you I see one of our young Brothers up there and he's probably the same as kid you know you say it whatever amen you know and and uh I said have you got a best friend yes and what's his name oh Bell or whatever it would be you know is that right I said tell me do you think he would tell her I never thought of that you know if you're asking me just like a 12 year old boy you know and here he is as quiet as a church promotionally yeah and and his mom come in and she was flabbergasted and she doesn't go to church either so this is what it was all about and so uh she brought in the coffee and I said to him you know we'll call him Paul at met nabin Paul I said hey Paul can I ask you a question yes I said would you mind if I prayed for this coffee and for your mom and dad could I pray for you he says yes it was all over you see Hallelujah God's given you the right word at the right time amen and I was able to pray for him and pray for his mom that she'll get right here's the Deacon that she'll come to church with him I'll tell you what a wonderful thing and you know the nice part of that story is the next day on the last day I was there the next day that Beacon I met him and you know he had a lovely home brother I'm in a real nice home he really had and I tell you what he said to me on the tears streaming down his eyes he's just grabbed me by the hand brother away and he says he said thank you for coming to my home Hallelujah just a little coffee break but I'll tell you what what you can do on a coffee break what you can do in a coffee break Hallelujah wonderful you know when that word was waved over Nathaniel Hallelujah at give him life amen okay let me just finish it all up I can say a little more but but you know I I I just finish it off that word materialize because this is just a little important part you know if he abide in me and my word abide in you then you have God and the word is in you brother Brown I'm all quotes from him and you believe the word you just believe what God's because it is God it's Inseparable and if you have God's word in you you have God's life in you and you've gotten you whatever God's word speaks forth out of you it'll come to pass like it was spoke from God if you say to that mountain amen you see uh that it'll happen just like Paul when the snake bit him you're a dead man no sir I got a stand before Caesar what a matter of another snake how to beat him on the other hand that would have been the same thing Hallelujah God said you've got to stand before Caesar Hallelujah well let me just get up into this and this is the close I've got about two more paragraphs amen and I'll finish up amen night so praise the Lord anybody that ever got anything with God took God at his word and acted as though it was already finished he is here for when God speaks a word it's already finished that's right God's word is ever forever confirmed in heaven oh my I like that and so do I Hallelujah I like that and so do I already finished as soon as it leaves the lips of God it's a word that has to materialize so is there a city Abraham look for it Ezra said Brother Gary it has to be a city because he said there's a city Hallelujah and we are going to that City amen and you know it's real enthusiasm it's not worked up I didn't give myself a couple of tablets today to get worked up I've got the Holy Ghost tablet amen and you know that's wonderful Hallelujah it throws my heart amen and it has to materialize when he said let there be light it doesn't matter if it looks like nothing's happening but it was already materializing Hallelujah well well what's in you today as a believer the word of God is in you have you obeyed me in my word about it we've routed out and rounded out to one every angle out of the day the word is in you brother Branham says the word that is in you will materialize is that right brother Samuel that's the quote it will quote see potentially it's there the word promised before the foundation of the world and around here that only reflects the negatives that reflects the positive the word see and the same thing or the translation of the Bride see the word a new materializing every time you come to church this is the place to be because the word is materializing in you hallelujah amen until maybe just like the Enoch you know we get to the place where that's it Hallelujah we've reached it and amen and he says the word that's in you now watch this is what he says the body will materialize around that word wow so we've got something wonderful in us today Hallelujah we've got the word of God and did it with Sarah he says and it will materialize like that with us amen now so this is this is all finished up amen now listen praise the Lord when Jesus said if that's a little bit rough for you you might have something with it but I hope not but when Jesus said I'll put it this way and this is it closing up amen God bless you've been very kind he says where I am there's shall ye be also if you want it that way if the other one's a bit too much for you the word in you and all the material if that's the way but okay that's fine but I'll tell you what where I go there shall you be offered what about that would that be the same thing amen you've been changed Hallelujah you'll be like I'm what do you want to look like brother George I look like myself I know that but I'll tell you I want a body like his forget that as David said when I wake up with your women's happy happy amen hallelujah the guy said Hey Brother Terence he sold a lot of ice cream and and he made a fortune actually doing it and he was talking to one of the old employees you know what had worked with him for 30 years or something he said you know what was what was the secret of our success he said boss you don't know I'll tell you he said yeah what was it he said it was a happy food and people needed to be made Happy ice cream you take off at home and work and bring your ice cream because it's a happy food you know the calories made me happy feet you know we all love the ice cream you know okay where I am there ye may be also it's not wonderful folks if that materializes what are we we're in the glory and we're in the glory we're with him amen it doesn't matter what else happens you know where Jesus is does Heaven There praise God yes there was an old preacher a very famous preacher he's going through Dublin or not Dublin London all the mist and the disease and I'll tell you what he was walking along there one day on his nice suit dressed and marching along probably with his Cane and his nice hat on and he walked into this poor area and he walked past this this few houses and he heard him coming from a little hush he said I recognize that him I don't know what it was I don't know what it was it might have been Amazing Grace and he backed up and he knocked the door someone opened the door there's this little poor little woman Pearl woman and she was there singing this song and he looked at this hovel they couldn't believe it and you know he said you man of a prayer with you and she said yes and that's where he got it from where Jesus is it's Heaven There hallelujah amen where he is and not mine went Earth Hallelujah thinking that she was living in a better place than he was living Hallelujah it doesn't matter what it's like down here whatever you've got it doesn't matter folks God bless you in it amen but as long as Jesus is there and I know he is it should be Heaven There hallelujah amen where I am and this is the very last thing listen to this he said when we see all these things materializing and we can't see them can we not we can see the the devil say the satanic said materializing we can see the bright side materialism amen and he says when we see this materialism he said harsincere ought we to be and I'll tell you what I think if we're guilty of anything it's in sincerity it's not feeling we we read it and we say it about you know trying to feel for the other person it's hard but I'll tell you what if you can just get into their position then you'd be maybe feeling what they feel amen and let us be like people like God but sincere amen no wax no covers up no Spirit no getting the old cracks all filled in with wax and saying oh I'm a dove when really it's still a black bird you know no you want the real thing you want to you want amen uh the the when you see these things materializing we want to be sincere we've got one goal in our mind to be in that body change to be in that Rapture Hallelujah I tell you what brother brought him at one time said he said have I wasted my whole life preaching to this this church here rock and roll half dressed and all that dirt until he's seen the bride coming again Hallelujah he said no though I haven't
