[11:57] so
[12:01] i appreciate each one of you
[12:03] and good to be in the house the lord and
[12:05] um
[12:07] and
[12:09] just have a
[12:11] couple of
[12:12] uh
[12:14] i had a couple of prairie quests and
[12:17] um
[12:17] i didn't want to
[12:19] make mention
[12:20] i didn't i didn't do this
[12:22] sunday but uh it's just something that's
[12:25] i just want to share with you it's a
[12:27] something good's a testimony our brother
[12:30] from nepal brother ted she calls
[12:32] and talks to me and texts me all the
[12:34] time and asks about everybody and he
[12:36] watches the services so he knows when
[12:39] everybody's sick
[12:41] he knows more about what's going on in
[12:42] the church than we do sometimes he's
[12:44] he's very
[12:45] but he's very mindful and he and he does
[12:47] a lot of praying and
[12:48] uh
[12:50] he always he always asked me about
[12:52] brother dale sister peggy always wants
[12:54] to know how they're doing and and the
[12:56] different ones and
[12:58] but uh
[13:00] this past weekend for the first time in
[13:03] in three years they had church
[13:05] they've not had they've not had to have
[13:07] zoom
[13:08] meetings they actually got together in
[13:10] in church building and so he was so he
[13:13] was so happy
[13:14] to be able to you know because
[13:16] you know we take it for granted
[13:18] sometimes
[13:19] when you know we all get together
[13:21] but you imagine three years
[13:24] of zoom meetings the most people that
[13:26] they could have together at one time was
[13:27] five people
[13:30] and that was church
[13:32] and they would go from one house to
[13:34] another house to another house and
[13:36] and so it may take you know it may take
[13:38] you weeks
[13:40] or months to see everybody
[13:43] and all you get to see is just that
[13:44] little zoom screen you know that your
[13:46] internet connection and that was
[13:48] fellowship
[13:50] and so i just wanted to share that with
[13:51] you that
[13:52] appreciate that because he was he was
[13:54] very excited and i just
[13:56] want to share that with you thank the
[13:57] lord that they are able so
[13:59] maybe one of these days if the lord
[14:02] tarries and makes away maybe we'll get
[14:04] to go over there
[14:05] and see them
[14:06] and fellowship with them over there
[14:09] and he just he's just a real precious
[14:11] brother and
[14:14] just tries to help out you know and kind
[14:17] of goes along with what i uh
[14:19] want to speak about tonight but uh if
[14:21] you have your bibles we'll just go right
[14:23] into the scripture and then i have uh
[14:26] some
[14:26] just like we all do we just got some
[14:28] prayer requests and
[14:31] a lady that
[14:33] she requested prayer
[14:35] for her brother it's been several years
[14:37] ago
[14:38] the lord touched him he had cancer he
[14:40] had
[14:41] he had to go through the treatment
[14:42] everything but the doctors were amazed
[14:44] at how well he had done
[14:46] and so uh she told me the other day that
[14:49] they sent him back to the doctor it's
[14:51] been several years since he's been i
[14:52] guess in remission
[14:54] and they're saying the cancer has come
[14:55] back or they're they're running tests
[14:57] but that's that's what the doctors are
[14:58] thinking so i said well the lord done it
[15:01] the first time i said he'll do it again
[15:03] so i said well definitely mention it to
[15:05] the church that we'll just put him on
[15:07] the list and we'll continue to pray his
[15:08] name is leonard
[15:10] and then and you know he knows that the
[15:12] lord touched him the first time because
[15:15] doctors can only do so much but it takes
[15:17] it takes the lord to do the rest of it
[15:18] and so
[15:19] so we're definitely going to hold him up
[15:21] in prayer i said well
[15:23] we've seen this battle before and the
[15:24] devil was defeated so
[15:26] we just believe that so if you have your
[15:29] bibles we're going to go to romans
[15:30] chapter 12
[15:32] and then we're going to go to
[15:34] ephesians 4
[15:37] and
[15:40] just very familiar scripture and i don't
[15:44] may not
[15:45] want to try to hold you along tonight
[15:46] but just want to share a few things with
[15:49] you and then
[15:52] encourage you be a blessing amen
[15:56] amen so let's just all bow our heads and
[15:58] we'll speak to the author before we read
[16:00] the scripture tonight
[16:01] our heavenly father
[16:03] lord jesus we're just so thankful lord
[16:05] to be in your house again tonight

[16:32] and lord we're just so thankful lord
[16:34] that even if we never felt your presence
[16:35] lord we know that you'd honor your word

[16:55] your preeminence lord that you can have
[16:57] your way with us tonight
[17:00] lord let us just not just be another
[17:02] gathering lord but we just want to see
[17:03] you
[17:04] high and lifted up
[17:06] and father we commit all things lord for
[17:08] all the needs that are
[17:10] represented in this building lord of
[17:12] many ones that have the hands that have
[17:14] been raised lord the ones that have been
[17:15] read lord
[17:17] lord there's so many
[17:18] we sometimes we fail to remember them
[17:20] all lord but we know that you're mindful
[17:22] of every one of them lord you said
[17:24] before we even ask lord that you would
[17:26] answer
[17:27] and lord we know that you have all the
[17:28] answers lord and we know that
[17:31] lord that we just committed to you
[17:33] and we just thank you for it lord
[17:34] because we know it's a finished work
[17:37] lord we just commit all things to you in
[17:38] the name of jesus christ tonight amen
[17:42] yeah romans chapter 12
[17:44] again at verse 1
[17:47] and very familiar scripture and it says
[17:49] i beseech you therefore
[17:52] brethren by the mercies of god that you
[17:54] present your bodies a living sacrifice
[17:56] holy acceptable unto god which is your
[17:58] reasonable service and be not conformed
[18:01] to this world but be transformed by the
[18:03] renewing of your mind that you may prove
[18:05] that
[18:06] what is that good and acceptable and
[18:08] perfect will of god for i say through
[18:11] the grace given unto me to every man
[18:14] that is among you not to think of
[18:16] himself more highly than he ought to
[18:18] think but to think soberly according as
[18:22] god hath dealt to every man the measure
[18:24] of faith
[18:26] for as we have many members in one body
[18:29] and all members
[18:31] have not the same office
[18:34] so we being many are one body in christ
[18:37] and everyone remembers one of another
[18:40] having then gifts differing according to
[18:43] the grace that is given to us whether
[18:46] prophecy
[18:47] let us prophesy according to the
[18:49] propitiation of faith
[18:52] a proportion of faith or ministry let us
[18:54] wait
[18:55] on our ministering or he that teacheth
[18:58] on teaching
[18:59] or he that exalt
[19:03] exhorted
[19:04] on exhortation
[19:06] he that giveth let him do it with
[19:08] simplicity he that ruleth with diligence
[19:11] he that showeth mercy
[19:13] with cheerfulness amen
[19:16] and so we'll go to uh
[19:18] ephesians chapter four
[19:23] and read another very
[19:26] very familiar scripture
[19:28] you almost almost quote this but
[19:35] and it says
[19:37] verse 11 says and he gave some apostles
[19:39] and some prophets and some evangelists
[19:42] and some pastors and teachers for the
[19:43] perfecting of the saints for the work of
[19:45] the ministry for the edifying of the
[19:47] body of christ till we all come in the
[19:50] unity of the faith and of the knowledge
[19:52] of the son of god unto a perfect man
[19:54] unto the measure of the stature of the
[19:56] fullness of christ that we henceforth be
[19:59] no more children tossed to and fro and
[20:02] carried about with every wind of
[20:03] doctrine by the sleight of men and
[20:05] cunning craftiness whereby they lie and
[20:08] wait to deceive but speaking the truth
[20:10] and love may grow up into him and all
[20:13] things which is the head even christ
[20:17] for for whom from whom the whole body
[20:20] fitly joined
[20:21] together and compacted by that which
[20:24] every joint supply according to the
[20:26] effectual working in the measure of
[20:29] every part maketh increase of the body
[20:32] unto the edifying of itself in love
[20:35] amen god bless you tonight you can be
[20:37] seated
[20:39] and
[20:41] tonight i wanna
[20:44] very
[20:45] very simple title
[20:47] the the body ministry
[20:51] and
[20:57] you know
[21:00] here
[21:02] paul's speaking and
[21:04] you know
[21:07] you know he says that every man that has
[21:10] been given a
[21:11] a portion
[21:13] and and brother branham
[21:15] you know we'll we'll see later on where
[21:17] brother i'm talking about you know every
[21:18] person has a has a ministry
[21:21] amen
[21:22] and here's paul saying you know we
[21:23] shouldn't think uh any higher of
[21:25] ourselves and we all think but we all
[21:26] think soberly
[21:28] and and that's the and
[21:30] that's the one thing that
[21:32] that kind of caught my attention in in
[21:34] reading this scripture
[21:36] he said
[21:37] but to think soberly according as god
[21:40] hath dealt to every man the measure of
[21:42] faith
[21:43] they said for we have we have many
[21:45] members in one body and all the members
[21:48] don't have the same office but we all
[21:50] work together
[21:52] and we all have a have a ministry
[21:56] and the scripture tells us
[21:58] that each one of these positions
[22:01] is for the edifying of the body
[22:04] and so if we all have a position
[22:09] then we ought to we ought to think
[22:14] about what our position is
[22:17] and what god has called us to
[22:20] and to be and to think about it
[22:23] what god
[22:24] has given us and to think soberly about
[22:27] that position
[22:29] because if if god give us called us to
[22:32] this place god didn't call us into the
[22:34] body of christ just to be part of the
[22:36] body
[22:38] but there's a position and everything
[22:40] has to work together just like in a
[22:42] natural body there all has to work
[22:45] together and there's everything is has
[22:48] to work in harmony
[22:50] and so there's a total function in the
[22:52] body that has to take place and when you
[22:54] have this it all has to work together
[22:58] and you know so when when we we think
[23:00] about these things you know
[23:02] you know many times
[23:04] and i want to read ephesians because
[23:06] most of the time when people talk about
[23:08] ministry everybody goes to the fivefold
[23:10] ministry and they look and say this is
[23:12] the fivefold you know because they put
[23:14] this is the ministry
[23:15] and we failed to
[23:17] and sometimes it's not that
[23:20] you know we look at somebody else and we
[23:22] think about their ministry
[23:24] but sometimes
[23:25] what what paul was reading about in
[23:29] when what paul was quoting here in
[23:30] romans the first part is to be a living
[23:34] sacrifice you know to to think of
[23:36] ourselves
[23:37] but but i want you to see that to see
[23:40] what you know because i can point out
[23:42] that that brother danny has has a
[23:45] ministry or i can see that sister monica
[23:47] has a ministry or i can point somebody
[23:50] else has a ministry but then i then i
[23:52] put myself in a position where it's like
[23:54] well what do i'm supposed to do
[23:57] because you know what because the the
[23:59] and the problem and the problem is this
[24:01] is if we don't take an account of who we
[24:03] are
[24:04] and it's not and it's not well you know
[24:06] we're part of the five-fold ministry
[24:08] whatever your position is whatever your
[24:10] part is
[24:11] it's important
[24:13] and god called you to that and you
[24:15] shouldn't think any less of yourself
[24:18] than anybody else
[24:20] because you have a part in the body and
[24:22] the part that you play
[24:24] is important
[24:27] and not only is it important to do your
[24:29] job to find out what your position is
[24:31] but to fulfill that position
[24:35] because i i later on i want to maybe
[24:38] look at some things and you know when
[24:40] you see things in the scripture when
[24:42] they when they start to stand out to you
[24:43] then you know what it it it makes it
[24:45] makes
[24:46] the things that god has called us to do
[24:50] it gives it it gives it a a greater
[24:53] importance
[24:55] because because it becomes a more a more
[24:59] uh a cherished thing in your life
[25:03] to to uphold these things and you know
[25:06] and you know because many times we we
[25:08] have people and and and they can look
[25:10] into the scripture and they'll go to
[25:12] hebrews and then they say you know
[25:14] forsake not the assembling of yourselves
[25:16] together
[25:17] as the sun as this as the manner of some
[25:20] is and he said and so much more as the
[25:22] day approaches
[25:24] well the thing is is it's not that we're
[25:26] that you know that
[25:28] something's going to happen
[25:30] that you know it's but the problem is is
[25:33] you know you don't realize what when you
[25:35] come together it's all of those licks of
[25:38] fire coming together
[25:42] and so you know as as as it talks about
[25:44] you know each one of us have our has a
[25:47] ministry each one of us has a place
[25:50] and and so when you when you look at
[25:52] these things
[25:54] we look here in the in the scripture you
[25:56] know i want to get into some things but
[25:58] you know when you see when you look into
[25:59] the scripture and you see these things
[26:01] you see the position that god called
[26:03] people to do
[26:04] and when you see these things
[26:07] you know when you look at them it may
[26:08] not look much to you but in the long run
[26:11] it became very important
[26:15] because even later on even when when
[26:18] paul gets into reading and talking of
[26:21] the scripture talking about the body you
[26:23] know he said that you know you you can't
[26:24] say because you know you're one part of
[26:26] the body that you know i don't have no
[26:28] need of another part because you know
[26:31] you're the you're because you're the
[26:32] eyes he said well i don't need i don't
[26:33] need the ears or i don't need this other
[26:36] part because i have no need of you
[26:38] but he said every part had had a
[26:40] position
[26:41] because there's a because it's a where
[26:44] you know it's not all just sight or or
[26:47] hearing or speaking but it's a whole
[26:49] body
[26:51] and it's it's a whole body ministry
[26:55] and sometimes we you know and when that
[26:57] starts when we start this out it starts
[26:59] here in the local assembly it starts
[27:01] really it starts in the family
[27:04] that's where that's where this the
[27:05] ministry starts in your family
[27:08] because you know you as men being the
[27:11] head of the household and overseeing the
[27:13] spiritual life of the family
[27:16] and then then a mother being the fifth
[27:18] gospel then raising the children
[27:22] and then everything that they do
[27:24] everything that we say and do
[27:27] is is an example
[27:29] of of christ in the church
[27:32] or christ in the bride so the way we
[27:34] handle each situation
[27:37] as paul instructs men he said he said to
[27:40] love love your wife as your own flesh
[27:44] and and to le and to love your wife as
[27:46] christ loved the church
[27:49] and then sometimes when we began to see
[27:51] these things then you know what we we
[27:53] realize that we we are way below our
[27:55] stand below the standard
[27:58] we we live because sometimes you know we
[28:00] life gets in the way and we allow things
[28:02] to get in the way that hampers our walk
[28:05] with god
[28:06] and so when when the the life that we
[28:08] live affects the people around us
[28:12] and when we've seen the uh
[28:16] the the example that that has been given
[28:19] to us in this day
[28:22] you know i was thinking about where
[28:24] where you know brother billy paul always
[28:26] told the told the uh
[28:28] testimony about brother branham and he
[28:30] said you know he said he never you never
[28:32] could tell who brother branham's friends
[28:34] and enemies were because he treated them
[28:35] all the same
[28:39] when you know when he knew that people
[28:40] were there and they hated him and they
[28:43] done everything behind his back that
[28:45] they could undermine him and you know
[28:46] what he still loved them and still
[28:48] fellowshipped with them
[28:51] and he knew and he knew what was going
[28:53] on and
[28:54] and brother perry green tells the tells
[28:57] the uh story one time and and he was up
[29:00] and they were out in the uh
[29:03] i guess they were in the woods or the
[29:05] wilderness on the mountain wherever you
[29:07] know they were out hunting or whatever
[29:09] and uh
[29:11] brother brandon began to share with some
[29:13] things about things that were going on
[29:14] with some brothers and the things that
[29:16] had happened well you know
[29:18] you know big brother perry green he got
[29:19] up there and he was just like he was
[29:21] just like well i'm gonna go give them a
[29:23] double anointing of texas
[29:25] you know he was just ready he was ready
[29:27] because you know brother perry green he
[29:29] wasn't no little fella
[29:30] but you know he was ready and and
[29:32] brother branham later on they were going
[29:34] down through they said you know he said
[29:36] if we had time he said we should just go
[29:37] over this way so those brothers over
[29:39] there he said we ought to go fellowship
[29:40] with them
[29:43] and brother perry had to pick his jaw up
[29:45] off the ground
[29:47] he's like
[29:48] ghost fellowship with them after that
[29:50] what they've done
[29:52] and he rebuked brother perry for his
[29:54] attitude
[29:56] he said brother that's the wrong
[29:57] attitude to have
[29:59] you shouldn't approach things like that
[30:05] because if they the way they act the way
[30:07] they do things
[30:08] shouldn't affect the way we handle them
[30:13] we should we should be able to hand
[30:15] because that's that's the work of god in
[30:17] our lives
[30:19] that we should
[30:20] handle them the way god would
[30:25] that when you know when as brother brown
[30:27] was talking about in the in the statue
[30:28] of a perfect man when you when you're
[30:30] dealing with your brother and you see
[30:31] the things that goes on and the things
[30:33] that he's he's had to battle and and the
[30:36] the battle of the different things he's
[30:37] going through and knowing how to handle
[30:39] it and understanding where your
[30:40] brother's coming from
[30:43] and under and so knowing how those are
[30:45] different
[30:48] you know to have brotherly kindness and
[30:51] and and patience and the different
[30:53] things with with your brothers and your
[30:55] sisters
[31:00] you know this is from the
[31:01] this is from the message
[31:05] the smyrna church age
[31:07] 1960
[31:09] brother brown said god never intended
[31:11] the church to be run by men
[31:13] god runs his church and he runs it
[31:16] through gifts of the spirit
[31:19] the gifts of the spirit is in the church
[31:21] to correct the spirit
[31:23] he's got five ministerial offices in his
[31:25] church
[31:28] and i i
[31:30] wanted to emphasize that because you
[31:31] know some people some people think well
[31:33] it's just the spirit
[31:35] we know the the spirit and the gifts are
[31:38] in a man
[31:41] so you know and and as i've said many
[31:44] times and
[31:45] as as long as i i can't i'm i'm going to
[31:47] still say the same thing
[31:49] but you know i thank god for our pastor
[31:52] i thank god for the ministry and and i
[31:54] think what i think god what he's done
[31:56] for me
[31:58] through
[31:58] them and so when we talk about you know
[32:02] the the spirit
[32:04] yet there's a divine order how the
[32:06] spirit works
[32:09] so you know it's not it's not just
[32:11] floating here and there and running all
[32:13] over the countryside or whatever and and
[32:15] you know but but god has a divine order
[32:17] on how these things work
[32:20] and so when he says
[32:21] that he never intended to be run by man
[32:24] it was by the spirit of god well then
[32:25] the spirit of god is what's working in
[32:27] the man
[32:29] if you have if you have a real ordained
[32:31] god called man then it's the spirit
[32:36] you know because then the spirit is
[32:38] what's leading it's not the man that's
[32:40] leading so when when we see that you
[32:43] know so when he talks about it's the
[32:45] spirit that's running the church then
[32:47] yes
[32:48] it's the spirit of god in the man it's
[32:50] it's working through the he said
[32:52] through these offices he says first of
[32:54] them is apostles or missionaries
[32:58] and he says a missionary is one who's is
[33:00] the highest there is apostle the one
[33:01] that's
[33:02] the word missionary who means one sin
[33:04] apostle means one cent
[33:07] and he said why they ever
[33:09] chose to be called missionaries i don't
[33:10] know but their apostles are not apostles
[33:12] prophets
[33:13] teachers evangelist pastors now that's
[33:15] the elected offices of god in his church
[33:18] then in each local church there's nine
[33:20] spiritual gifts that come
[33:22] come among the people that is knowledge
[33:24] wisdom he gifts of healing working of
[33:26] miracles tongue speaking with tons
[33:28] interpretation
[33:31] and
[33:33] i think the one that brother branham
[33:35] doesn't quote here i think is
[33:37] discernment of spirit i think is the
[33:38] other one and all these things go in
[33:41] each local body and each person in the
[33:44] church has an individual ministry and
[33:47] that individual ministry goes together
[33:49] with the rest of the ministry to edify
[33:52] the body of jesus christ
[33:56] so i wonder i want to read that because
[33:58] you know when we see
[34:01] when we talk about the the ministry
[34:04] and what god has for each one of us then
[34:07] you know we have to see that god called
[34:10] us to do something
[34:14] whether whether it's to sit on sit on
[34:16] the church pew and that's
[34:18] okay because you know there's some
[34:21] people that sit behind the scenes and
[34:22] you'll never see
[34:24] them
[34:25] they don't get up and sing because they
[34:27] couldn't carry a tone in a bucket
[34:30] i was talking to i was talking to a lady
[34:32] the other day and you know talking about
[34:34] people singing in church and i was like
[34:35] yeah you know asked me about me singing
[34:38] i told her i said yeah they like for me
[34:40] to sing the dismissal song
[34:42] and she's like what do you mean i said
[34:43] well that's how they get everybody out
[34:44] of the church quick you know i start
[34:46] singing they just run them out you know
[34:48] she started laughing i was like no it's
[34:49] not true but anyway
[34:50] uh but you know you know some people you
[34:52] know they could they could clear the
[34:54] building i mean if you know
[34:56] they would have that gift to be able to
[34:57] do that
[35:00] but you know everybody has has a gift
[35:06] and one of the things i want i want to
[35:08] say
[35:10] you know
[35:11] we don't try to push people into doing
[35:15] something
[35:17] but you know we want you that have a
[35:19] gift
[35:21] that god has given you a talent to do
[35:24] something then use it for the honor and
[35:25] glory of god
[35:28] that is a ministry
[35:31] you know i mean some people are very
[35:33] musically inclined and you know that
[35:35] that would be a great thing to use
[35:36] that's a great asset to have
[35:40] you know i mean you know some people
[35:41] couldn't find middle c on a piano to
[35:44] save their life and some people couldn't
[35:45] even tell you that there was a middle c
[35:47] on the piano
[35:49] because they never heard of that
[35:52] but you know god but see the thing is if
[35:54] if you know that god has blessed you
[35:56] with a talent
[35:59] and then then you know then if you will
[36:01] put that before god then god will
[36:03] cultivate that
[36:06] i've seen i've seen people that you know
[36:08] they they have they have a gift
[36:11] and then i said well you know they have
[36:12] to they have to practice something
[36:14] they have to work at something
[36:17] i was like well you know i have never
[36:19] ever seen anybody that does any kind of
[36:23] you know it doesn't matter what it is in
[36:25] this world that they ain't never
[36:26] practiced at it
[36:31] you know i mean
[36:33] let's take for instance
[36:36] uh
[36:37] michael jordan
[36:38] you know the great michael jordan you
[36:40] know and everybody talks about you know
[36:42] him being the the one of the greatest
[36:45] you know the basket that's ever played
[36:47] basketball
[36:48] i mean he he is like the standard that
[36:51] everybody looks at when they talk about
[36:52] basketball
[36:55] this is the same same young man that
[36:57] many years ago back in north carolina
[36:59] did not make his high school basketball
[37:01] team
[37:04] would stand outside in the pouring rain
[37:07] and shoot baskets making free throws
[37:12] now it wasn't that you know that he
[37:14] didn't have talent but it was something
[37:16] that he put in that he cultivated that
[37:18] to get to that place
[37:21] so it was it wasn't something that you
[37:23] know he was just automatically just born
[37:24] into that it just automatically just you
[37:27] know he just he just automatically done
[37:28] it but there was pride there was
[37:30] practice
[37:32] and you know it's just it's just like
[37:34] you know you look at some of the great
[37:36] composers of the world bach and
[37:38] beethoven and and the different ones you
[37:39] know somebody had to show them how to
[37:42] hold a violin
[37:45] somebody had to teach them the basics
[37:49] and they started them on the journey
[37:50] well then guess what it didn't take some
[37:52] of those composers very long and the
[37:54] teachers were like i can't teach them
[37:56] anything else
[37:57] but somebody had to start them on that
[37:59] journey they had to show them
[38:02] and so there was that was something that
[38:03] was they were blessed with but something
[38:06] had to take place and and you go back
[38:08] and look at the great men of this world
[38:10] somebody had to had to see that there
[38:12] was a gift that was inside of them and
[38:14] it had to be cultivated something had to
[38:16] take place
[38:19] when when abraham lincoln was was a was
[38:22] a small child and his mother passed away
[38:26] you know his dad all his dad thought of
[38:29] him was somebody that could go out and
[38:31] hold rows of corn and split logs for
[38:34] fencing
[38:36] and that's all he'd ever amounted to
[38:38] was a backwoods farmer
[38:42] but his stepmother when his stepmother
[38:44] came along his stepmother saw that god
[38:47] had a gift in that boy's life
[38:50] now she didn't know what he was going to
[38:51] do but she knew god was going to use him
[38:55] and she continued to tell him all the
[38:58] time that he needed to study and read
[39:01] and wanted him to have an education when
[39:03] his daddy wanted to have him in the
[39:04] fields all the time she kept telling him
[39:07] and that's the reason that one of the
[39:08] things that he talks about even brother
[39:09] i'm talking about him you know he had
[39:11] such a desire to study and he fed on the
[39:14] word of god
[39:16] and reading and reading fox's book of
[39:18] martyrs and pilgrims progress and he
[39:20] began to cultivate and you know he was
[39:23] he was one of the most amazing men that
[39:25] because of somebody that come from the
[39:26] backwoods of kentucky and yet when he
[39:29] wrote and he spoke he had such a
[39:31] biblical influence in his writing they
[39:33] said that there's never been another
[39:35] writer in the whole history that they
[39:37] can see of writings that was so
[39:39] influenced by the bible
[39:42] and here and here this man was that
[39:44] never went to college had you know just
[39:46] a few years of schooling but on his own
[39:48] he became a lawyer
[39:50] that god called him into this place and
[39:52] you know god he began to study and under
[39:55] grow
[39:56] and you know he had a lot of hardships
[39:58] and difficulties and different things
[40:00] that happened in his life but he
[40:01] overcame all of that to become what god
[40:03] wanted him to be and here's brother
[40:05] branham saying the greatest president
[40:07] that we ever had
[40:09] yet yet he had a gift in his life but
[40:11] you know what he had to go through
[40:12] hardships and he had to cultivate what
[40:14] god give him
[40:16] and you and i are the same way god gives
[40:18] us gifts but you know what they have to
[40:20] be cultivated they have to be worked at
[40:23] there has to be a struggle there has to
[40:25] be an overcoming through that you know
[40:27] just because you know god calls you to
[40:30] to be a minister you know well it just
[40:32] god just don't drop everything in your
[40:34] lap
[40:36] and then everybody thinks well god
[40:37] called brother branham and god gave
[40:39] brother branham the word and it just
[40:40] fell in his lap
[40:43] and i you know always point people back
[40:45] well let's let's go back and we'll read
[40:46] what brother ram said he read all the
[40:48] commentaries and he said he appreciated
[40:50] all the things that scofield wrote and
[40:52] all the different ones throughout the
[40:54] history and that he read everything that
[40:56] they had to say
[40:59] and so he began to study all of these
[41:01] things been reading so it wasn't like
[41:03] you know that he didn't read the
[41:04] scripture he didn't study he didn't pray
[41:08] he had a he had a great understanding of
[41:10] things but so then god when god and then
[41:13] when when he was preaching on the i
[41:14] think it was the 70 weeks of daniel and
[41:16] he was talking about those encyclopedias
[41:18] that was given to him
[41:21] he said you know that brother gave him
[41:22] he said well see brother he said i found
[41:23] this information i was looking for in
[41:25] those encyclopedias
[41:28] well see then the encyclo that was god
[41:31] working that he gave brother branham
[41:32] those encyclopedias for him to use them
[41:35] but you know what the book just didn't
[41:37] fall open and the page is scurrying and
[41:38] it's like
[41:39] in the
[41:40] light shown on this one section read
[41:42] this brother branham
[41:46] but you know that's what but sometimes
[41:47] you know we want to have some kind of
[41:49] supernatural thing to take place
[41:52] but you know the bible tells us he said
[41:54] to study to show thyself approved
[41:58] so it's not it's not you know
[42:00] you think about all the times that
[42:01] brother dale always talked about you
[42:02] know uh
[42:04] reading all those books and listening to
[42:06] two tapes and every single day doing the
[42:08] exact same thing reading all those books
[42:10] all listen all those tapes and just
[42:12] feeding on the word of god
[42:15] well you know what it wasn't like
[42:16] brother brandon or brother dale got
[42:18] something the lord just opened up every
[42:19] time that he read something he just
[42:21] opened up
[42:23] he just wasn't quick into him every
[42:24] single time but you know what he fed on
[42:26] that and he had something and that he
[42:28] held onto that for the lord to quicken
[42:31] that and so it's the same way with you
[42:33] and i if we can feed on the word then we
[42:35] have to have something there that has to
[42:37] be sown for it to be quickened
[42:47] so
[42:48] you know when
[42:49] we have
[42:51] when god calls us
[42:52] in the end of this ministry god calls us
[42:55] to a place then you know it takes a it
[42:58] takes work
[43:00] and it takes it takes time to and
[43:02] brother i'm talking about you know you
[43:04] yield yourself into that
[43:07] you know that you yield yourself to that
[43:10] position and find out what god calls you
[43:12] to
[43:13] and when we then we can find what god
[43:15] then we can exercise in that
[43:19] because you know if if god calls us in
[43:22] into the body
[43:24] and then as as we are as we come to
[43:27] faith
[43:29] then then there's a there's a growth
[43:30] development
[43:33] then they said add to add to your faith
[43:35] virtue and to virtue knowledge and to
[43:37] knowledge temperance well as you're
[43:39] growing then you're becoming more but
[43:41] see that's
[43:43] all of that is taking place to bring you
[43:45] to a place
[43:46] that god can use you
[43:50] because you know you know it's it's good
[43:52] that when you have little children
[43:55] when your kids are little that you can
[43:57] teach them to do certain things
[44:00] that they that you know they can pick up
[44:02] after themselves
[44:04] and you know they they can they can put
[44:06] their plates away they can pick up their
[44:08] toys they can do certain things you know
[44:10] you don't have to get to a certain age
[44:12] you know you hopefully that that you
[44:14] don't have to tell them to blow their
[44:15] nose that they can figure out how to do
[44:17] that on their own
[44:20] you know there's as is you know because
[44:22] you you train a child and they learn how
[44:24] to go to the bathroom and do different
[44:26] things and you know you don't have to
[44:27] tell them to go wash their hands because
[44:29] they figure out how to do that
[44:32] because as as the child grows
[44:36] and then it becomes more things for them
[44:38] to do
[44:41] and then you know because you get to a
[44:43] place where you know what you don't have
[44:44] to tell your children
[44:46] all the time
[44:48] to when the trash can can's full to take
[44:50] it out
[44:52] praise the lord we're going to get there
[44:54] one day
[44:56] i know it i just believe it
[45:00] but you know there's a there's a growth
[45:02] where those things they take place but
[45:04] you know what they're there there's a
[45:06] greater time that's coming
[45:11] when when a child gets old enough to
[45:12] drive then guess what they can do things
[45:14] for
[45:16] you you know because you know it's like
[45:19] well you know when
[45:20] you know they you you buy all the
[45:22] groceries and they decide to they they
[45:24] have this uh unction of the spirit to
[45:26] eat everything in the house it's like
[45:28] well good now you can go to the store
[45:29] and get some more
[45:30] instead of me having to go get it then
[45:32] you can you can go get the groceries
[45:34] yourself
[45:36] and so you know as as time progresses as
[45:38] things go along
[45:40] as they grow up then there's other
[45:42] things for them to do
[45:44] and so as they can as they
[45:46] grow and become more mature then they
[45:48] they can have more responsibilities they
[45:50] can do more things and there's and
[45:52] there's more opportunities for them
[45:54] and so it's the same way in the gospel
[45:56] god gives us more as we become more
[45:58] mature christians then god is calling us
[46:01] up from being just just babes but coming
[46:04] up in the stature of the fullness of
[46:06] christ that we can become more like him
[46:08] that the world can see that we can be
[46:10] more of a ministry to the body
[46:14] not just not just being babes
[46:18] but as as as as we grow up in christ
[46:21] then then god can use us in the place
[46:23] that he wants us to where he wants us to
[46:26] what he wants us to do what he's called
[46:28] us to do
[46:30] and so you know we don't all we don't
[46:31] always get there right off the bat and
[46:33] it may be a slow process but you know
[46:35] what we if we keep our eye on the goal
[46:39] and not and that we see that god has
[46:41] called us to a place and god called us
[46:43] to minister
[46:45] to each other it's one of the things
[46:47] that that caught my attention about
[46:48] brother
[46:49] richard this weekend talking about the
[46:51] the four living creatures and he was
[46:52] speaking of you know being the
[46:55] with having the spirit of the ox and and
[46:57] being being a
[46:59] a burden bearer and you know going
[47:01] through all these things you know that's
[47:02] that's what we're called to do is be a
[47:04] minister
[47:06] to to be a servant
[47:08] as jesus as jesus said the time there
[47:11] and i believe it said mark you know he
[47:13] said that you know whoever is going to
[47:15] be the greatest among you he said let
[47:17] him be the servant of all
[47:20] you know if you want to be great then
[47:22] learn how to then learn how to be humble
[47:24] learn how to be small
[47:26] that's what god wants
[47:29] and so if we cannot learn how to be
[47:31] humble as as you know as a scripture
[47:34] what speaks of you know jesus he made no
[47:37] reputation of himself but but he humbled
[47:39] himself into the death of the cross and
[47:42] you know so he just became humble and
[47:44] and realized who he was and what god had
[47:46] called him to do
[47:48] you know as as many times you know the
[47:51] we spoke of before
[47:52] you know the old testament when the when
[47:54] you go back and look in the old
[47:56] testament when they saw what the mighty
[47:58] conqueror was coming to do the messiah
[48:00] was coming to conquer and yet they
[48:02] didn't realize that there was a whole
[48:04] other side of the ministry that was
[48:05] going to come that he was going to
[48:07] become of a humble birth
[48:09] be born of obey you know be born of a
[48:12] virgin that became a babe into the world
[48:16] and then that he would that he would
[48:18] suffer these things and you know come
[48:20] not not the way that they expected him
[48:22] but he become humble
[48:25] one because if it wasn't for spiritual
[48:28] eyesight that the lord had spoke to them
[48:30] they would have never saw him
[48:33] well because it was only to the elect
[48:35] that he came
[48:40] it wasn't to the rest of them
[48:42] and so they missed him
[48:46] because they didn't they weren't looking
[48:49] at it the way that god wanted them to
[48:52] the great the great
[48:54] leaders of the day
[48:57] the ones that had such great
[48:59] understanding and looking into the word
[49:03] but yet they lack the the revelation of
[49:05] the word they lack the leading of the
[49:07] spirit to show them the word
[49:12] they had created their own denominations
[49:15] brother branham said
[49:18] so they had their own ideas their own
[49:20] thoughts
[49:21] and when he came they missed him
[49:25] excuse me
[49:27] so
[49:30] i want to look at
[49:33] something here
[49:34] and
[49:36] when you look in
[49:38] the old testament
[49:40] and looking at the children of
[49:42] israel and
[49:45] this this may look
[49:47] a little a little bit off
[49:49] uh just bear just bear with me is this
[49:51] not a rabbit trail
[49:53] i don't think anyway
[49:54] uh but you know when you look in the old
[49:56] testament and you see the the um
[50:01] the children of israel go back to when
[50:03] uh jacob
[50:05] when he
[50:06] was in come out of you know come out of
[50:08] egypt
[50:11] uh when he was in egypt and um
[50:14] he
[50:14] had the
[50:16] all the all of his sons and you know he
[50:18] began to
[50:21] you know he's living in in egypt and all
[50:23] around the
[50:24] all of the
[50:26] the all the ites that were there that
[50:28] you know kind of
[50:31] tried to intermingle with them and
[50:34] and you know when we see how
[50:37] jacob was was there and
[50:42] when one of his uh
[50:44] daughters
[50:47] donna's in the scripture you know
[50:50] one of the princes of one of the cities
[50:52] uh took advantage of her
[50:55] and you know what when he when he took
[50:57] advantage of her
[50:59] you know
[51:00] had had two sons levi and simeon
[51:05] and you know
[51:06] they the the the prince wanted wanted
[51:10] their dog their their sister wanted
[51:11] jacob's daughter for his wife and you
[51:14] know he he wouldn't have that
[51:17] now he had done his
[51:19] uh i guess you'd call it um
[51:23] deceit this deceitfulness there but you
[51:25] know he pulled it he pulled and told him
[51:27] you know that that if you're going to go
[51:29] through this then you have to go through
[51:30] circumcision which they did and you know
[51:33] simmy and levi went in there and killed
[51:34] the whole you know they went and cleaned
[51:36] the house and and killed the whole city
[51:38] and you know
[51:39] and it it made jacob mad
[51:43] jacob jacob told him
[51:45] he said he said why have you done this
[51:48] and and we're we're in this location
[51:50] where we have all these heights around
[51:51] us
[51:53] and here here we are we're in this
[51:54] location he said you know they could
[51:56] come up and double up on us and then you
[51:58] know he said they could destroy us
[52:01] and
[52:02] and levi says you know he says he said
[52:05] but why would you allow your daughter to
[52:08] be treated as a harlot
[52:12] and then later on we see in the
[52:14] scripture in genesis
[52:16] 49 when when jacob
[52:19] and what's so amazing is he was so
[52:21] afraid but you know he was anointed he
[52:23] was anointed of god
[52:25] that he's that that he his seed because
[52:27] he was he was the seed of abraham and so
[52:30] that their seed would be innumerable so
[52:33] he couldn't be destroyed if he wanted to
[52:35] no matter what come against him because
[52:36] they couldn't be destroyed because he
[52:38] was the seed of abraham and they were
[52:39] supposed to still fulfill the
[52:41] the law
[52:42] the word of god but uh and and when
[52:46] jacob is is blessing the sons before he
[52:49] passes away he comes and he speaks of
[52:51] simeon and levi
[52:53] and he speaks and he says
[52:55] simeon and levi are brethren instruments
[52:57] of cruelty are in their habitations
[53:00] he says o my soul come not bow into
[53:03] their secret unto their assembly mine
[53:05] honor
[53:06] be not thou united
[53:08] for in their anger they slew a man and
[53:10] in their willful their self will they
[53:12] dig down a whale cursed be their anger
[53:14] for it is fierce and their wrath for it
[53:17] is cruel i will divide them in jacob and
[53:20] scatter them in israel
[53:22] so the one thing that that you find in
[53:25] when he blesses the the sons and he
[53:28] places them in the promised land and he
[53:31] tells them what their what their
[53:32] possessions are he did not give a
[53:34] possession to simeon and he didn't give
[53:36] one to levi
[53:38] so that was the two that were left out
[53:41] now we know later on in the scripture
[53:43] that in joshua we find out that
[53:47] judah
[53:48] i'm sorry simeon gets a portion of
[53:51] judah's possession because he was giving
[53:53] it to him because they said our portion
[53:55] is too large he said so simeon will have
[53:57] this portion so the one that got left
[54:00] out was levi
[54:03] but you know it's it's an interesting
[54:05] thing when you when you begin to read
[54:07] this and and you and you see that
[54:09] when when they
[54:10] we see what happened
[54:14] but you know it was something that that
[54:16] struck levi that what levi was going to
[54:19] do was he was going to stand where
[54:21] nobody else was going to stand
[54:24] and then we see later on that in in the
[54:27] scripture that the levites
[54:30] were the ones that
[54:33] when they when they had their
[54:35] gathering with the golden calf and and
[54:38] the different things and god rose up to
[54:40] rebuke them the levites were the ones
[54:42] that rose up to destroy the children of
[54:44] israel
[54:47] and so they were they were the ones and
[54:49] then brother branham here and this is
[54:50] from questions and answers
[54:52] 1954 brother branham says he said now
[54:55] one day there was sin in israel and
[54:57] there was a man by the tribe of the name
[55:00] of levi
[55:02] he said they pulled their swords and
[55:03] they went they went with moses to the
[55:06] camp and they destroyed everything that
[55:08] was seen is that right
[55:11] god looked down and said because you did
[55:13] this and stood for me
[55:16] your all these others will serve you
[55:21] you go right into the temple as priest
[55:23] is that right you stay right in the
[55:26] temple and the rest of them will work
[55:27] and bring you in a tent and take care of
[55:29] you is that right
[55:31] oh hallelujah if you can see what the
[55:33] temple was
[55:34] that the levites was the bride
[55:37] now when sin
[55:38] is awakening on every hand the levites
[55:41] is pulling their sword the holy ghost
[55:43] born bride is standing out saying jesus
[55:46] christ in the positive is jesus christ
[55:48] in the negative just the same sin is
[55:50] still sin god says come you now blessed
[55:53] of my father that is the bride
[55:57] so when and and so i i wanted to i want
[56:00] to to show these things because when
[56:03] when he begins to speak of of levi and
[56:05] levi was the one that didn't have a
[56:07] portion in the land
[56:09] they were they were cut out
[56:12] but we say that brother uh
[56:15] in in deuteronomy chapter 10 he says he
[56:19] said at that time the lord separated the
[56:21] tribe of levi
[56:23] to bear the ark of the covenant of the
[56:25] lord to stand before the the lord to
[56:28] minister unto him and to bless his name
[56:31] unto this day
[56:33] wherefore levi have no part nor
[56:35] inheritance with his brethren
[56:38] the lord is his inheritance as according
[56:40] as the lord thy god promised him so then
[56:44] then we see that the rest of them had a
[56:46] portion in the land but god
[56:49] because of what they done what they
[56:51] stood up for
[56:53] god became their portion
[56:56] and god separated the levites out from
[56:59] the rest of the children of israel to be
[57:02] unto thee unto him
[57:05] numbers
[57:06] chapter 3 and and it says and the lord
[57:09] spake unto moses saying bring the tribe
[57:11] of levi near and present them before
[57:14] aaron the priest that they may minister
[57:16] unto him
[57:18] and they shall
[57:19] keep his charge
[57:21] and the charge of the whole congregation
[57:23] before the tabernacle the congregation
[57:26] to do the service of the tabernacle
[57:29] and they shall keep all the instruments
[57:31] of the tabernacle of the congregation
[57:33] and the charge of the children of israel
[57:36] to do the service of the tabernacle
[57:40] we've got there
[57:42] and thou shalt give the levites unto
[57:44] aaron and to his sons they are holy
[57:47] given unto him out of the children of
[57:49] israel
[57:50] and thou shalt appoint aaron and his
[57:52] sons and they shall wait on their
[57:54] priest's office
[57:56] and the stranger that cometh nigh shall
[57:58] be put to death
[58:01] so when he begins to speak of them being
[58:03] cut off
[58:05] because jacob was so upset with them
[58:08] that he said you're not going to have a
[58:09] portion in the land
[58:11] but you know what that's exactly what
[58:13] god wanted
[58:14] because god realized that you know what
[58:17] that's all right because i'm going to be
[58:19] your portion
[58:21] and of all the rest of them had a
[58:23] portion but god had his portion for levi
[58:27] in the land the levites were going to be
[58:29] he is
[58:30] and brother branham says and and this is
[58:32] this is from uh who do you say this is
[58:36] uh from 1964
[58:38] and and brother branham says now it it
[58:41] was then hallelujah when moses stepped
[58:43] forth and said who's for me and god amen
[58:46] he said it was the levite pulled his
[58:48] sword and went through the camp and
[58:50] utterly stray slayed everything that was
[58:52] connected with it
[58:54] amen everything every man that had a
[58:57] moabite woman they killed him right
[58:59] there together killed them right
[59:00] together
[59:02] now the hour has come he said where is
[59:04] that man
[59:05] where is aaron's sons come of the
[59:07] priesthood that's willing to pull the so
[59:10] the word of god this sharp two-edged
[59:12] sword said now who stands for me and god
[59:15] where is he at can invite invite but
[59:18] nobody answers see what i mean
[59:20] we don't get it
[59:22] he said there's something wrong notice
[59:24] there they was it was then that moses
[59:26] stood and said these things
[59:29] he said notice their sin that they did
[59:31] there when they denominated themselves
[59:33] with moabite and made them one body
[59:35] their sin was never forgiven them
[59:38] i'm just going to coast on that a minute
[59:40] he said it's late but just a minute
[59:42] their sin was never forgiven them not
[59:44] one of them ever made it the promised
[59:46] land ever made the promised land jesus
[59:48] said excuse me saint john 6 he said
[59:51] in saint john 6 when they said our
[59:53] fathers ate manna in the wilderness they
[59:57] were pentecostal brothers they eat manna
[59:59] they had the real thing
[1:00:00] jesus said and they're everyone dead
[1:00:04] they perished they're eternally gone
[1:00:07] their sin was never forgiven then what
[1:00:08] did they do they broke the covenant with
[1:00:11] god and organized with balaam the hiring
[1:00:13] prof the hireling prophet that wouldn't
[1:00:15] take the warning of god wouldn't take
[1:00:17] the take the word of god wouldn't take
[1:00:19] nothing of god but he was determined to
[1:00:22] get them all one
[1:00:24] can you see the folly i can stay on that
[1:00:26] for a long time
[1:00:28] but i think you get it's either their
[1:00:30] sin never was forgiven not one of them
[1:00:32] that lived under those blessings and eat
[1:00:34] that manna and everything
[1:00:39] so there was one group that stood up
[1:00:42] that god called
[1:00:43] and they
[1:00:44] they didn't have a portion
[1:00:47] but god gave them a portion
[1:00:49] and they were the ones that stood up and
[1:00:51] when nobody else did they were the ones
[1:00:53] that stood and took charge and because
[1:00:57] of what they done
[1:00:59] that god honored them and set them aside
[1:01:01] and said them to himself and said they
[1:01:04] will serve aaron
[1:01:06] see in the original when god called them
[1:01:08] into the building of the tabernacle and
[1:01:10] setting the priesthood the only ones
[1:01:11] that could serve in the portion of the
[1:01:14] tabernacle and the priesthood and the
[1:01:16] sacrifices everything was aaron and his
[1:01:18] sons
[1:01:20] but the levites were set aside now they
[1:01:23] were called out people that were set
[1:01:24] aside and they were to minister to aaron
[1:01:29] and his sons
[1:01:32] and so there was a portion that was
[1:01:33] given to them but they were a set aside
[1:01:35] people but they was given a ministry
[1:01:37] that was set aside from the priesthood
[1:01:40] but they were still called of god and
[1:01:42] was given a portion
[1:01:46] and so when brother branham goes back
[1:01:47] and and he says and said if you
[1:01:49] understand the temple he said you see
[1:01:50] that the levites are the bride
[1:01:53] so then then we understand that when the
[1:01:55] bride the bride everybody the bride has
[1:01:58] a ministry will the bride have a
[1:01:59] ministry yes
[1:02:01] and brother ryan says yes the maid of
[1:02:03] apostles provide a preacher evangelist
[1:02:05] and pastors but you know what that
[1:02:07] didn't do away with the other portion of
[1:02:09] the of the levites
[1:02:12] you know there was a portion that was
[1:02:14] called to do one thing and you know they
[1:02:16] were called they were singers
[1:02:18] there was a portion of the levites and
[1:02:20] they were musicians
[1:02:22] and there was and there was a portion of
[1:02:24] the levites that never served never
[1:02:26] served in the office of the priest but
[1:02:29] you know what you couldn't be you
[1:02:30] couldn't be a priest without being a
[1:02:32] levite but you could be a levite without
[1:02:34] being a priest
[1:02:36] now lots of times when you go into the
[1:02:37] scripture and you read them it's an
[1:02:38] interchangeable word but when you begin
[1:02:40] to read the scripture and you see that
[1:02:42] there is a distinction made between
[1:02:45] the levites and the priests
[1:02:47] but see god called them a separated
[1:02:50] people anointed people
[1:02:53] god that give them and they gave them he
[1:02:56] was their inheritance he gave them an
[1:02:57] inheritance and they were called to a
[1:02:59] position
[1:03:02] but see the thing is is they didn't they
[1:03:03] didn't do this other part but they had
[1:03:06] their own part to do
[1:03:09] so when you see when we when you speak
[1:03:11] of
[1:03:12] having a ministry understanding that you
[1:03:15] know that we're all called of god and
[1:03:18] we're all anointed of god and we all
[1:03:19] have the same inheritance but you know
[1:03:21] what god has called us to a different
[1:03:23] portion
[1:03:24] so that we all have to find our part to
[1:03:27] find out what god wants us to do
[1:03:31] so god didn't call us all to be the
[1:03:33] exact same thing but there's parts that
[1:03:35] we have to do
[1:03:38] now when we go into the scripture here
[1:03:40] in numbers
[1:03:42] i want to i want to read a
[1:03:45] few scriptures here from numbers chapter
[1:03:47] 3 and when brother when moses began to
[1:03:50] to lay this out and he began to speak to
[1:03:52] the children of israel and he begins to
[1:03:54] talk to aaron
[1:03:56] about what was to take place and how
[1:03:58] everything because the one thing that
[1:04:00] they had to learn though in the first
[1:04:02] part of the of the of the book
[1:04:05] you know moses are writing and these and
[1:04:06] he's telling them hey listen when you
[1:04:08] build when you build the tabernacle the
[1:04:10] tabernacle has to be you know
[1:04:12] each each pole has to be a certain
[1:04:14] length and it has to be made of this and
[1:04:16] you and you and you and the altar has to
[1:04:18] be made of this and you know it has to
[1:04:20] be this much gold and everything has to
[1:04:22] be a certain way and the length of the
[1:04:24] curtains have to be so long and the
[1:04:26] cords have to be a certain color and all
[1:04:28] these caps and all these different
[1:04:29] things there's a different part that
[1:04:31] everything lays out
[1:04:33] and they all built all these parts that
[1:04:36] they built a tabernacle
[1:04:39] and then he said he said then the the
[1:04:41] cloud of day was the the pillar of fire
[1:04:43] at night and the cloud by day was there
[1:04:46] and he said you know what he said the
[1:04:47] presence of the lord would come down and
[1:04:49] he said well he would stay there and he
[1:04:51] said while he was there
[1:04:53] when the cloud was there he said they
[1:04:54] stayed
[1:04:56] but you know there was a there's an
[1:04:58] interesting part of what had to take
[1:04:59] place
[1:05:01] they had to move
[1:05:03] when the when the cloud began to move or
[1:05:05] the pillar fire began to move whether it
[1:05:06] was day or night you know what they had
[1:05:08] to pick up and move they followed the
[1:05:10] cloud
[1:05:11] wherever the cloud was going they were
[1:05:13] going so the thing is that you have to
[1:05:14] low
[1:05:16] not only have to put everything together
[1:05:17] and know where all the portions go there
[1:05:19] was an interesting part that had to be
[1:05:21] taken that had to take place is
[1:05:23] everybody had to know how to take this
[1:05:24] thing down and load it up
[1:05:28] everybody had to have their part
[1:05:31] now in numbers chapter 3 we see
[1:05:34] and it says and he and he takes
[1:05:37] moses uh god calls moses and he tells
[1:05:40] him to take the three of the sons
[1:05:44] and he says and the charge of verse 25
[1:05:46] he says and the charge of the sons of
[1:05:48] gershon and the tabernacle of the
[1:05:51] congregation
[1:05:52] shall be the tabernacle
[1:05:58] and the tent and the covering thereof
[1:06:01] and the hang of the door of the
[1:06:02] tabernacle of the congregation
[1:06:05] and the hangs of the court
[1:06:07] and the curtain of the door of the court
[1:06:10] which is by the tabernacle and by the
[1:06:12] altar roundabout and the cords of it and
[1:06:15] all the service thereof
[1:06:18] and then
[1:06:19] we go to verse 29
[1:06:22] and it says
[1:06:24] and the families of the sons of cough
[1:06:27] shall pitch on the side of the
[1:06:28] tabernacle southward
[1:06:30] and so that's another thing that you
[1:06:32] find out is
[1:06:33] the children of israel had to lay had to
[1:06:35] be in divine order around the tabernacle
[1:06:37] where the the
[1:06:39] the levites had to do the same thing
[1:06:42] because you know aaron and moses and
[1:06:44] they were on the east side
[1:06:46] of the tabernacle but you know they even
[1:06:48] had to be laid out in in their divine
[1:06:50] order also that and it says and the
[1:06:52] chief of the house of the father of the
[1:06:54] families of kohites
[1:06:55] shall be elephant the son of uzio and
[1:06:58] their charge shall be the ark
[1:07:01] the table the candlestick and the altars
[1:07:04] and the vessels of the sanctuary
[1:07:06] wherewith they minister and the hanging
[1:07:08] and all the service thereof and eliezer
[1:07:11] the son of aaron the priest shall be
[1:07:13] chief over the chief of the levites and
[1:07:16] have the oversight of them to keep the
[1:07:18] charge of the sanctuary
[1:07:21] and then and then we see if we drop down
[1:07:24] in verse 36 it says and under the
[1:07:27] custody in charge of the sons of mirari
[1:07:30] shall be the boards of the tabernacle
[1:07:32] and the bars thereof
[1:07:34] and the pillars thereof and the sockets
[1:07:37] thereof and all the vessels thereof and
[1:07:39] all that serveth thereto and the pillars
[1:07:42] of the court round about and their
[1:07:43] sockets and their pens and their cords
[1:07:48] so not only was it was they given a
[1:07:50] portion that each one of them had to do
[1:07:53] when it was when the tabernacle was
[1:07:55] broke down they just all didn't pitch in
[1:07:57] and do their own thing
[1:07:59] but god called them each even in that
[1:08:02] portion that they had to do their own
[1:08:04] part of breaking down the tabernacle and
[1:08:07] it was given each one of them that each
[1:08:09] one of them had to follow their own part
[1:08:13] and what what i thought was so
[1:08:15] interesting about this is you know when
[1:08:17] when david decides hey we're going to
[1:08:19] bring we're going to bring the ark of
[1:08:20] the covenant down
[1:08:23] and he says you know here we are we're
[1:08:25] going to put them on we're going to put
[1:08:26] on an ox cart because you know this is
[1:08:27] the new modern way of doing things
[1:08:29] and then brother brown says you know it
[1:08:31] was supposed to be carried on the
[1:08:32] shoulder of the levites but you know
[1:08:34] what was so amazing according to the
[1:08:36] scripture it didn't have you couldn't
[1:08:38] just have any levite touch the ark of
[1:08:40] the covenant because god called those
[1:08:43] the only certain ones that could have
[1:08:45] that
[1:08:52] sound like a condenser fan is going
[1:08:54] something's out there
[1:08:56] anyway
[1:08:58] praise the lord
[1:08:59] but you know each but he said he said
[1:09:01] when they come he said he said when the
[1:09:03] the
[1:09:04] brother ham said that when when the ark
[1:09:06] began to slide and he said the levite
[1:09:08] could only touch it but only one only a
[1:09:10] certain part of the levites could do
[1:09:11] that because only certain ones of them
[1:09:13] and yeah it was carried on the shoulder
[1:09:15] of the levites but you know what not
[1:09:16] every levite was called to carry the ark
[1:09:20] not every not every part of not all the
[1:09:22] levites were called to do every certain
[1:09:24] part they were all given a certain
[1:09:26] portion to do
[1:09:27] and so then when you see the god has
[1:09:30] called each one to do their part then
[1:09:32] when it when there's a part to be done
[1:09:34] then what god called you to that's your
[1:09:37] part
[1:09:39] and then you know it's important to do
[1:09:41] your part to understand what your part
[1:09:43] is
[1:09:47] so
[1:09:50] and and so from uh reading uh
[1:09:53] this is from uh first corinthians here
[1:09:56] when when
[1:09:57] peter
[1:09:58] paul's speaking of the
[1:10:00] gifts and he says now he said now there
[1:10:03] are diversities of gift but the same
[1:10:06] spirit
[1:10:07] he said there are differences of
[1:10:08] administrations but the same lord
[1:10:11] he said there are diversities of
[1:10:13] operations but is the same god which
[1:10:15] worketh all in all
[1:10:17] he said but the manifestation of the
[1:10:19] spirit is given to every man to prophet
[1:10:21] with all
[1:10:23] so we understand that there are
[1:10:24] diversities of gifts and all these
[1:10:26] things it's the same spirit
[1:10:29] that works through all these gifts
[1:10:31] and different
[1:10:32] the same lord
[1:10:35] but he said that the manifestation
[1:10:37] of the spirit is given to every man
[1:10:41] to profit the whole body
[1:10:44] so that it's
[1:10:46] too so you know you know when you see
[1:10:51] you know
[1:10:52] so when you see
[1:10:53] that
[1:10:55] god called you to do some you know to be
[1:10:57] a a part of this body whatever it is
[1:11:01] then you know what you know
[1:11:03] we're going to be incomplete without you
[1:11:07] whatever whatever part that you do
[1:11:10] it's incomplete
[1:11:13] because you know god's not complete
[1:11:15] without you
[1:11:17] whatever whatever little part you think
[1:11:18] that that you think is is is so
[1:11:21] insignificant but god called you and
[1:11:23] it's it's still to god it has a part
[1:11:27] so there's a portion
[1:11:30] for each one
[1:11:32] and it says and for one he said it's
[1:11:34] given the spirit of the word of wisdom
[1:11:37] to the word of
[1:11:38] knowledge and to another the faith and
[1:11:41] so
[1:11:42] he said to another working of miracles
[1:11:45] to another prophecy to another
[1:11:46] discerning of spirits another kind
[1:11:50] another diverse kinds of tongues another
[1:11:53] the interpretation of tongues but all
[1:11:55] these work if that one and the same self
[1:11:58] spirit dividing to every man severally
[1:12:01] as he will
[1:12:02] so then you know everybody has a part
[1:12:05] but you know you can be you can be used
[1:12:07] in more than one office
[1:12:10] and one have more than one gift
[1:12:12] operating
[1:12:14] because you know the spirit of the lord
[1:12:16] because you know
[1:12:17] god get
[1:12:20] god's in control and he does how however
[1:12:22] he wants to do it
[1:12:24] and so if if he wants to if he wants
[1:12:27] more than one person to have more than
[1:12:28] one gift and that's then that's the way
[1:12:30] he has it's his uh
[1:12:33] prerogative or you know that's his
[1:12:35] divine will of how these things will go
[1:12:40] they said for as the body is one and
[1:12:41] half many members all the members of
[1:12:43] that one body being many are one body
[1:12:46] all so also is christ
[1:12:49] he said for by one spirit we're all
[1:12:50] baptized into one body whether it be
[1:12:52] jews or gentiles whether we be bond or
[1:12:55] free and have been all made to drink
[1:12:58] into one spirit
[1:13:00] he said for the body is not one member
[1:13:02] but many
[1:13:04] he said if the foot shall say because i
[1:13:06] am not the hand am i not the body
[1:13:08] is it therefore not the body
[1:13:10] if the ear shall say because i am not
[1:13:12] the i am i not the body
[1:13:15] is it therefore not of the body if the
[1:13:17] whole uh the whole body where i
[1:13:20] where were the hearing if the whole
[1:13:22] we're hearing where were the smelling
[1:13:25] but now have god set the members every
[1:13:28] one of them in the body as it hath
[1:13:30] pleased him
[1:13:33] so you know
[1:13:34] you know god doesn't have doesn't make
[1:13:36] accidents y'all don't have accidents and
[1:13:39] things just don't happen by
[1:13:41] happenstance
[1:13:43] but you know what god has called each
[1:13:46] one of you
[1:13:47] and each one of us to a place
[1:13:50] at his own pleasure
[1:13:52] at his own divine will
[1:13:54] and he said if if they were all one
[1:13:56] member where were the body
[1:13:59] now
[1:14:00] are there many members yet but one body
[1:14:04] they said in the eye cannot say unto
[1:14:06] hand i have no need of thee
[1:14:08] nor again the hand of the foot i have no
[1:14:10] need of you
[1:14:11] name much more those members of the body
[1:14:14] which seem to be more feeble are
[1:14:16] necessary and those members of the body
[1:14:19] which we think to be less honorable upon
[1:14:22] these we bestow more abundant honor and
[1:14:25] our own calmly parts have more abundant
[1:14:28] comeliness
[1:14:29] for our commonly for our commonly parts
[1:14:32] have no need but god have tempered the
[1:14:34] body together having given more abundant
[1:14:37] order to that part which lacked
[1:14:40] that there should be no schism in the
[1:14:42] body but that the members should have
[1:14:44] the same care one for another
[1:14:47] so when you look at your body even even
[1:14:50] the smallest parts that you think are
[1:14:52] not
[1:14:53] significant
[1:14:55] and yet yet they are more significant
[1:14:58] and they are having given more honor
[1:15:01] because you know when you you know
[1:15:03] because even even a child
[1:15:06] when when they're young you know they
[1:15:08] have they have modesty
[1:15:13] because you know what they have a they
[1:15:14] have a reaction
[1:15:17] because you know what they'll cover
[1:15:18] themselves up
[1:15:20] and so there's certain parts that you
[1:15:22] know that that we we give honor to
[1:15:26] and other ones that we don't have to you
[1:15:27] know
[1:15:28] you don't have to wear a hat
[1:15:32] but there are certain parts that do have
[1:15:33] to be
[1:15:35] covered
[1:15:37] and you know you have to
[1:15:39] look over these these ones you care
[1:15:41] about
[1:15:43] so there's care that's given to these
[1:15:45] other parts that so you know
[1:15:47] even even though they may look
[1:15:49] insignificant
[1:15:52] even even the smallest part of your body
[1:15:55] you know you all you all you gotta do is
[1:15:57] get a paper cut or a splinter
[1:16:00] and you know what
[1:16:02] they you know they talk about you know
[1:16:03] having having
[1:16:05] you know gunshot wounds and a lot of
[1:16:07] pain it's like well sometimes one of the
[1:16:08] worst aggravating pains you can have is
[1:16:10] a is a splinter
[1:16:13] it'll drive you up the wall
[1:16:15] but so you know and so when we see these
[1:16:18] things we think you know these may not
[1:16:20] have a a a function that that is like
[1:16:23] any other one but yet they're still a
[1:16:25] part of the body
[1:16:26] and you know it says can you can you say
[1:16:28] well because you're not this i got no
[1:16:30] need of you
[1:16:33] well you got to do is wait to wait till
[1:16:34] it gets cut one time find out if you if
[1:16:37] you need it or not
[1:16:38] if if
[1:16:39] you if you miss it or not
[1:16:43] you know i i cut my finger washing
[1:16:46] dishes when i was a kid and uh i had my
[1:16:49] hand
[1:16:50] telling brother luis i think was i had
[1:16:52] my hand down in the glass and i was
[1:16:53] washing and thing broke the whole side
[1:16:56] of it just popped off and i cut my hand
[1:16:58] and i sliced that thing right there back
[1:17:00] and it just
[1:17:01] laid open
[1:17:03] and let me tell you what i thought i was
[1:17:04] going through the ceiling
[1:17:06] but you know i still got the scar right
[1:17:08] there and you know it ain't never it's
[1:17:09] always been odd looking because it and
[1:17:12] you know what you know it's like well
[1:17:13] that's kind of insignificant but you
[1:17:15] know what it was significant that day
[1:17:18] it was significant for a while
[1:17:21] i didn't i didn't i i only speak english
[1:17:24] but i think i could have spoken other
[1:17:25] languages that day
[1:17:28] but you know what it's it's it may be
[1:17:30] insignificant but you know what it still
[1:17:32] has has an importance
[1:17:35] and because he says you know
[1:17:39] he said so much more these members of
[1:17:41] the body which seem to be more feeble or
[1:17:43] more necessary
[1:17:44] and those those members of the body
[1:17:46] which think less honorable upon these we
[1:17:48] bestow more honor and our uncommonly
[1:17:50] parts we have more abundant calmlyness
[1:17:53] for our calmly parts have no have no
[1:17:55] need but god have timbered the body
[1:17:57] together having given more abundant
[1:17:59] honor to that part which lacked that
[1:18:01] there should be no schism in the body
[1:18:06] so then all all the parts no matter how
[1:18:08] small or insignificant or whatever they
[1:18:10] all have a part and they have to all
[1:18:13] work together
[1:18:14] but that the members should have the
[1:18:16] same care one for another
[1:18:19] and whether one member suffer all the
[1:18:21] members suffer with it or one member be
[1:18:24] honored all the members rejoice with it
[1:18:26] and ye are the body of christ and
[1:18:28] members in particular and god has set
[1:18:31] some in the church first apostles
[1:18:33] secondarily prophets third teachers
[1:18:36] after that miracles then the gifts of
[1:18:39] healings helps governments diversities
[1:18:41] of tongues he said are all apostles
[1:18:44] are all prophets are all teachers are
[1:18:46] all workers of miracles have all the
[1:18:49] gifts of healing do all speak with
[1:18:51] tongues do all interpret
[1:18:53] he said but covet earnestly the best
[1:18:55] gifts and yet shew i unto you a more
[1:18:59] excellent way
[1:19:02] so then all of those things and you know
[1:19:05] every part has it has its part
[1:19:08] and it all has to work together so he
[1:19:10] you know so we're not all doing the
[1:19:12] exact same part but we all have to work
[1:19:13] together it all works together and so
[1:19:16] there's a part that each one of us have
[1:19:18] to do for it to for it to work right
[1:19:22] you know because you know
[1:19:23] you know if you if you've ever have have
[1:19:26] a problem in your in your body the one
[1:19:29] little part then you know other parts of
[1:19:31] the body have to compensate for that
[1:19:35] you know you know because
[1:19:37] and you know when you when you
[1:19:39] um
[1:19:42] like me when you when you when you break
[1:19:43] your elbow and you can't move your arm
[1:19:45] you know it um you don't you don't do a
[1:19:47] lot
[1:19:48] you know because you know it's like they
[1:19:51] said well move your move your arms like
[1:19:52] listen we ain't moving this arm
[1:19:55] i was black and blue and everything else
[1:19:57] and you know it was like i couldn't you
[1:20:00] know i was like i kept my arm right
[1:20:01] there that's all i wanted i didn't want
[1:20:02] to move it
[1:20:04] you know and sarah had to help him take
[1:20:06] a shower and then you know they want you
[1:20:07] to move it they want to look at he's
[1:20:08] like no we ain't moving this
[1:20:10] it hurt too bad to move it
[1:20:12] and you know because you know i could i
[1:20:14] couldn't hardly move this thing out and
[1:20:15] it was like i was trying to hold it
[1:20:16] sarah was trying to hold it was trying
[1:20:18] to move it so i know you know you know i
[1:20:20] want some pain medicine y'all gonna plan
[1:20:22] on moving this thing if y'all plan on
[1:20:23] doing anything we're gonna we're gonna
[1:20:25] have to make some accommodations because
[1:20:26] this ain't working
[1:20:29] and so you know when you see people when
[1:20:31] they when they go through things and and
[1:20:33] i think it's sister monica you know when
[1:20:35] you when you when you have a
[1:20:36] you go through your you know a problem
[1:20:38] with you like with your hip you know and
[1:20:40] then everything has to compensate
[1:20:43] and that affects every other part of
[1:20:44] your body
[1:20:47] and so you know everything so you know
[1:20:49] the god doesn't doesn't have you know
[1:20:51] you know what we're we're just going to
[1:20:52] you know because
[1:20:54] you know it's like you know you know
[1:20:56] here's a body with missing feet
[1:20:59] or here you got one that you know you
[1:21:01] got one foot that works and one that
[1:21:02] don't
[1:21:04] or even even if it's a finger or
[1:21:06] whatever little part it all has to work
[1:21:08] together
[1:21:09] it all has to function together
[1:21:12] and so you know when we begin to see
[1:21:14] these things you know all of these
[1:21:15] things have to work and all of us have
[1:21:18] to be an integral part of this
[1:21:21] and so when we see that what god has
[1:21:23] called us and and because
[1:21:26] you know because it's part of the of
[1:21:27] your family your your family
[1:21:31] and then you know the families make up
[1:21:33] the local assembly
[1:21:35] and so we make up this body of believers
[1:21:38] here which which is a family
[1:21:41] and so each one has a portion but you
[1:21:43] know each one of these that god has
[1:21:45] called us to you know god has called you
[1:21:47] here to be a part of this family
[1:21:49] of this body to do what god has called
[1:21:52] you to do
[1:21:54] and so you know what we can't we can't
[1:21:55] be a whole body without you and you
[1:22:00] without you doing your part
[1:22:03] and so you know when we see how how the
[1:22:05] ministry that you know what we do here
[1:22:08] is a ministry whether whether you get up
[1:22:10] and and all you do is take up the
[1:22:12] offering well then praise god you know
[1:22:13] you have a ministry that you're
[1:22:15] important
[1:22:17] that you function as a part of this
[1:22:18] family as a part of this body and then
[1:22:21] when we see that we all come together we
[1:22:23] all bring our licks of fire together and
[1:22:25] we all work together and we all edify
[1:22:27] one another and we all uplift one
[1:22:30] another and we all do that as a body
[1:22:32] then
[1:22:33] the others think that when you step up
[1:22:36] just a little bit higher than when you
[1:22:37] see then you know then we see that the
[1:22:39] bride at this age then we see that all
[1:22:42] the body the believers that you know we
[1:22:45] work as this body here this church but
[1:22:47] you know what we're connected with every
[1:22:49] other believer in this age all the
[1:22:52] believers around so that we're all still
[1:22:54] the body of christ
[1:22:55] so you know what then when the when the
[1:22:58] when the
[1:22:59] the ones in in central america when they
[1:23:01] hurt and when they have needs then you
[1:23:03] know what do we minister to them well
[1:23:06] because that's part of the body
[1:23:08] when they're on the other side of the
[1:23:09] world and you know they don't have
[1:23:12] modern conveniences and they don't have
[1:23:14] a lot of things and you know then you
[1:23:16] know what then we minister to them
[1:23:18] in the way that we that we can
[1:23:21] when you know i think about when one
[1:23:23] brother biscuit years ago he was uh i
[1:23:25] believe he went to india
[1:23:27] i believe it was where it was but you
[1:23:28] know he went and he was talking to the
[1:23:30] to the brothers over there
[1:23:32] and uh and uh
[1:23:34] when he went over there and he was uh
[1:23:36] talking to the uh might have been the
[1:23:37] philippines but anyway uh
[1:23:40] when he was talking to the brothers
[1:23:41] about how many many books that they had
[1:23:44] and he was talking about all the
[1:23:45] ministers over the years people had went
[1:23:47] over there and ministered and then
[1:23:48] brother biscuit was like how many books
[1:23:50] do you have brother and he was talking
[1:23:51] about you know he had
[1:23:53] they had ministers that had been
[1:23:55] preaching the message they had been
[1:23:57] following and they only had three
[1:23:58] message books
[1:24:01] and you know and some some of them only
[1:24:03] had one some of it somebody didn't have
[1:24:04] any soil just had a few and that's all
[1:24:07] the message that they had
[1:24:10] and it really stirred something brother
[1:24:11] biscuit you know what to get them the
[1:24:13] message what do we have to do to get
[1:24:16] them the message
[1:24:17] and so you know then it became a part of
[1:24:19] the body to help minister well because
[1:24:21] that was that was a commission that was
[1:24:23] given to
[1:24:25] to spread the gospel to preach the
[1:24:27] gospel to get them because we have to
[1:24:29] get this and i thank god for what god
[1:24:32] has done over the years that he's taken
[1:24:34] and we have all these modern
[1:24:35] conveniences now that we have all the
[1:24:37] technology to do that but for years you
[1:24:39] know there was brothers that that
[1:24:41] labored
[1:24:42] they labored in the word to get what
[1:24:45] they had
[1:24:48] when you when you talk about the this
[1:24:50] night back in the 60s when when when
[1:24:52] brother dale and them you know waiting
[1:24:53] on books out of jeffersonville and you
[1:24:55] know they were they were jacobs because
[1:24:57] they were going to get their books
[1:25:00] when you think about brothers they went
[1:25:02] and had to travel overseas you know some
[1:25:04] of these brothers they would travel to
[1:25:06] other places and sit down and listen to
[1:25:08] brother branham and they would write
[1:25:09] their own notes
[1:25:11] they would write their own message books
[1:25:15] to have the word they would write their
[1:25:17] own
[1:25:18] they would listen to other tapes and
[1:25:20] they would write the whole message and
[1:25:21] that would be copies of the message that
[1:25:23] they had
[1:25:26] see sometimes sometimes we think about
[1:25:27] that you know we don't we don't put into
[1:25:30] it what god what other people have
[1:25:33] we have not we have not because you know
[1:25:35] what when we have it in in every every
[1:25:38] kind of format that you can think of and
[1:25:40] we allow other things to hold us back
[1:25:42] when other people have to travel and
[1:25:44] they have walked and traveled and paid
[1:25:47] to ride on buses to go find and listen
[1:25:49] to the voice of the prophet when we can
[1:25:51] listen to it 24 hours a day seven days a
[1:25:54] week and sometimes you know what we
[1:25:56] don't have time to listen to it we ain't
[1:25:58] got time to read we ain't got time to
[1:26:00] pray when other people have done
[1:26:02] everything under the sun and because you
[1:26:04] know what they would give up their last
[1:26:06] breath they would give up their food to
[1:26:08] go and listen to something or be able to
[1:26:10] listen and read something from the
[1:26:12] scripture or read something from the
[1:26:14] message and how how weak are we
[1:26:17] when we don't do the exact same thing
[1:26:20] when we don't when we have come to
[1:26:22] church and you know what we don't take
[1:26:23] the time to pray before we come when
[1:26:26] we've not spent time before god and you
[1:26:29] know i'm not you know i'm preaching on
[1:26:31] myself because i'm i'm in that category
[1:26:34] i'm guilty just like anybody else but
[1:26:36] you know what it it's it's for us
[1:26:40] to put the time in god called us to
[1:26:42] administer if we plan on coming getting
[1:26:45] closer to god and coming and getting to
[1:26:47] a place and realizing that today the day
[1:26:50] that we live in when we see the the hour
[1:26:53] in which we live is such a late hour and
[1:26:55] we don't have time to play
[1:26:57] we don't have time to play
[1:27:01] that we have that we need to you know
[1:27:04] lord help me
[1:27:06] that i can be more and i have more zeal
[1:27:09] that i have that i have more concern
[1:27:11] about what needs to be done because you
[1:27:13] know what because that's what it's going
[1:27:15] to take to get out of here
[1:27:17] it's going it's going to take
[1:27:19] us to draw a little closer uh uh us to
[1:27:22] shed off the things that hold us back to
[1:27:25] move up a little closer in god because
[1:27:27] that's what god wants us because you
[1:27:29] know he's there drawing us that it's us
[1:27:31] to answer that to that drawing and then
[1:27:33] walk in that
[1:27:35] that we can become more because you know
[1:27:37] if it's if it's our day that god what
[1:27:39] god has called us in this day and i'm
[1:27:42] gonna try to i'm gonna try to close but
[1:27:44] what god has called us in this hour is
[1:27:46] to take a body change then you know what
[1:27:48] then we've got the only way that you're
[1:27:50] going to get a body change is not
[1:27:51] talking about it but you're going to
[1:27:53] have to get in the word until the word
[1:27:55] gets in you and then the word becomes
[1:27:56] quick and then you become the word
[1:28:02] then we have to we have to lay aside
[1:28:04] every weight and every and every sin
[1:28:06] that so easily besets us and run the
[1:28:08] race that god's called us to why because
[1:28:11] god's given us a ministry was like well
[1:28:13] what kind of ministry within that's what
[1:28:14] we have to find out to find out what god
[1:28:16] has called you to
[1:28:20] and so we see that this what god has
[1:28:22] called us to this age
[1:28:26] and then we see that that hebrews 11 40
[1:28:29] says they without us cannot be made
[1:28:31] perfect well then you know what if if if
[1:28:34] paul run his race and irenaeus run his
[1:28:36] race and all the ones down through time
[1:28:38] all these other ones these great men
[1:28:40] have run their race and done their part
[1:28:42] then you know what then we have to meet
[1:28:44] them
[1:28:45] with the same conviction with the same
[1:28:47] zeal with the same desire to do the
[1:28:49] exact same thing that they've done
[1:28:51] that we have to now we have to run the
[1:28:53] race the way they did
[1:28:56] then we have to then we have to lay
[1:28:57] aside everything that that we could that
[1:28:59] we can bring because you know what
[1:29:01] they're waiting on us
[1:29:02] they're waiting on us we have been it's
[1:29:05] our day that's been given this challenge
[1:29:08] to come to this place and but they
[1:29:10] realize realize god has called you to
[1:29:12] this
[1:29:13] god just like the levites god you're a
[1:29:15] separated people that god has separated
[1:29:18] to this god has given us an inheritance
[1:29:20] god has given us a portion god has
[1:29:22] anointed us to this that god has called
[1:29:25] us to this to operate in this way
[1:29:27] then get into our job is to come when we
[1:29:30] come to the house of god then you know
[1:29:32] what we should we shouldn't have you
[1:29:34] know all the things we should be able to
[1:29:36] shed all the things of the world and
[1:29:38] come in and worship god
[1:29:40] you know we should be able to get behind
[1:29:42] the pastor we should get behind the
[1:29:44] preacher you know what we should be able
[1:29:46] to pull on the gift we we should operate
[1:29:49] in a different realm
[1:29:52] you know i i think sometimes you know
[1:29:55] some of the when you go back and read
[1:29:56] some of the uh old uh stories of of
[1:29:59] those men
[1:30:01] that you know all the things that just
[1:30:03] like john wesley all the all the years
[1:30:05] that he had to travel and you know and
[1:30:07] go on horseback and all those different
[1:30:09] things and and all the things that
[1:30:11] people had to suffer through
[1:30:15] you know peter cartwright you know going
[1:30:17] in there i always always liked that
[1:30:19] story you know when he went in that bar
[1:30:21] and he told that man he was going to
[1:30:22] have church and that man come in there
[1:30:23] and told him said listen if you plan on
[1:30:25] having church in here said you got to
[1:30:26] whip me and he said well that's just the
[1:30:28] next thing i'll do then
[1:30:31] just like cleaning the floor and mopping
[1:30:33] the way you know cleaning the windows
[1:30:34] and everything like that well just
[1:30:35] whipping this other guy didn't matter to
[1:30:37] him
[1:30:39] it's the same thing
[1:30:42] if we come to the house of god then we
[1:30:44] should come in in the right
[1:30:47] attitude we should come with the right
[1:30:48] thought
[1:30:51] in the right spirit
[1:30:53] what god has called us to
[1:30:55] you know not to not allow the devil to
[1:30:57] hold us
[1:31:00] back but god has called us and every one
[1:31:03] of us have a ministry
[1:31:05] i want everybody to understand it's a
[1:31:06] body ministry it's not just one person

[1:37:47] i didn't know how to handle it i didn't
[1:37:48] know how to operate in love because i
[1:37:50] was angry with this situation and i felt
[1:37:52] like i don't have that love just yet you
[1:37:54] know like i was praying lord give me
[1:37:55] that love because i don't i don't have
[1:37:56] it and i don't want to be phony i know
[1:37:58] um
[1:37:58] the prophet says they know when you
[1:38:00] acting so you can't just put on that
[1:38:02] like you love somebody and they they can
[1:38:03] feel when you don't know when you got
[1:38:04] some tension there
[1:38:06] so i'm just being honest with the lord
[1:38:07] like god i just don't have it yet to
[1:38:09] respond to this right now so
[1:38:11] give me give me something you know give
[1:38:13] me give me something give me a crumb
[1:38:14] give me a give me the right attitude at
[1:38:16] least before i respond like give me the
[1:38:18] right attitude and i was serious with
[1:38:20] him and um i always believed like when
[1:38:22] you keep it real with god he he honors
[1:38:24] that you know i feel that way that's how
[1:38:26] he's dealt with me i just keep it real i
[1:38:28] ain't got it yet
[1:38:29] i'm gonna need you to help me to get it
[1:38:30] till i get there
[1:38:32] so um i was like lord just give me the
[1:38:33] right attitude before i respond because
[1:38:35] you know how that little flesh want to
[1:38:37] react right away without even thinking
[1:38:39] first well that's all i get sometimes to
[1:38:40] be honest so um i was like lord give me
[1:38:43] the right attitude to
[1:38:44] just respond in the right way so that
[1:38:46] this thing don't just
[1:38:48] turn into something they don't have to
[1:38:50] turn into so anyway um he did that he
[1:38:52] gave me the right attitude
[1:38:54] and he he was able to just calm me down
[1:38:56] and just answer the situation um
[1:39:00] with humility and i appreciated that he
[1:39:01] gave me a crumb and that's what i asked
[1:39:03] for just a little bit of
[1:39:05] something with the right attitude
[1:39:07] and that whole situation
[1:39:09] turned out to be some so different and
[1:39:11] so better
[1:39:13] than if i would have handled it wrong it
[1:39:15] would it would have it would have just
[1:39:17] satan would have had an open door to
[1:39:18] come in and just mess things up
[1:39:20] and uh right now my my youngest son need
[1:39:23] me to get along with that side of the
[1:39:24] family because he's he's only three
[1:39:26] years old and i need things to go right
[1:39:28] because i'm trying to get him but satan
[1:39:30] wants to come in and just destroy things
[1:39:32] you know what i'm saying so i just want
[1:39:33] to thank god for giving me the
[1:39:35] uh strength i need through his strength
[1:39:37] when i'm weak all right so um it's one
[1:39:40] more testimony but i hold off on that i
[1:39:41] know it's kind of late um but it was it
[1:39:44] was about me and isaac he might not want
[1:39:45] me to share that but he's smiling so i
[1:39:47] guess he do
[1:39:48] and um
[1:39:49] the other day ain't gonna lie
[1:39:51] the test has come
[1:39:53] the testes are easy when it's dealing
[1:39:54] with outsiders you know you can go on
[1:39:56] your way and okay bye and go on your way
[1:39:57] whatever my test has come when i'm with
[1:39:59] my family sometimes i don't know about
[1:40:01] nobody else so um it was between me and
[1:40:04] my son one day was in the house and uh
[1:40:07] it was kind of late so i just told them
[1:40:09] early on that okay we're gonna kind of
[1:40:10] do the dishes and clean up a little bit
[1:40:12] before it get too late and we heading
[1:40:14] back to sleep or whatever so
[1:40:16] he knew that so anyway it was about
[1:40:17] seven o'clock and um a little bit after
[1:40:20] seven and i came in this room i was like
[1:40:21] okay let's let's go ahead and knock out
[1:40:22] a few things so we can get ready for bed
[1:40:24] so um he came out or whatever
[1:40:26] and um he had like a little attitude
[1:40:28] first you know he had a little attitude
[1:40:29] why you wait so late so in my mind i'm
[1:40:31] like okay well i already tell you was
[1:40:33] gonna clean up you know why you wait so
[1:40:35] late you know you could have did it
[1:40:36] earlier and getting all into that so i'm
[1:40:38] feeling myself boiling up like okay my
[1:40:40] mind going into everything i do for you
[1:40:42] and uh
[1:40:43] the past the future oh when your coach
[1:40:45] tell you do something you do it for him
[1:40:46] why you got to argue me my mind going
[1:40:48] into the whole future the past
[1:40:50] everything right so i'm getting upset
[1:40:52] based on what i'm thinking about you
[1:40:54] know it's all in the head i'm getting
[1:40:55] upset more and more he upset so um by
[1:40:59] this time you know how the scriptures
[1:41:01] say a soft word turn away wrath well i
[1:41:02] might it i wasn't being soft either you
[1:41:05] know so i'm getting all upset with him
[1:41:07] we're talking back and um back and forth
[1:41:09] each other
[1:41:10] and um it's escalating because i'm
[1:41:12] getting more and more upset he's getting
[1:41:14] more upset so um at this point i tell
[1:41:18] him you know god said just just go
[1:41:19] outside the door and stand out there
[1:41:21] whatever just get out you know what i'm
[1:41:22] saying i'm getting like that just get
[1:41:23] outside the door and just stand out
[1:41:25] there because both of us are getting
[1:41:26] together ain't helping
[1:41:27] so um he go outside and i'm i can't keep
[1:41:29] quiet because i'm still upset he's
[1:41:32] outside the door and he hear me upset
[1:41:34] still talking so he's talking now my
[1:41:36] mind's thinking about the neighbor and
[1:41:37] then all this stuff so i'm like well
[1:41:38] come back in the house he come back in
[1:41:40] the house we're both still yelling or
[1:41:41] whatever at each other and
[1:41:43] in my spirit i feel myself wanting to
[1:41:45] calm down but i can't cause i'm just
[1:41:47] already giving it out i'm giving out the
[1:41:49] wrath already so i'm like man you know
[1:41:51] so he's upset and um
[1:41:53] you know i'm getting warm up saying more
[1:41:55] and more things i'm thinking i'm all in
[1:41:57] my emotions so i'm saying more and more
[1:41:58] stuff and uh
[1:42:02] he's upset the dishes are not getting
[1:42:04] done by now he he's um
[1:42:06] he you know i'm saying i don't know if
[1:42:07] he won't be terribly supportive i'm just
[1:42:08] keeping it real so um i'm getting him
[1:42:10] upset and i'm not helping because i'm
[1:42:12] not calming down myself and um so he he
[1:42:15] walks off and he punches two holes in
[1:42:17] the wall and while i'm talking i'm
[1:42:19] seeing this and it's like everything
[1:42:20] happening in slow motion you know what i
[1:42:22] mean
[1:42:23] so two big holes in the wall and i'm
[1:42:25] like at this point you gotta get up out
[1:42:26] of here you got to go you got to get out
[1:42:28] the house i can't think no more so i'm
[1:42:30] not in a calm state of mind where i'm
[1:42:32] like you know um well you know let's sit
[1:42:33] there and talk about it i'm heated you
[1:42:35] know he heated
[1:42:37] so um he got his little book bag and
[1:42:39] left out the door
[1:42:40] and um
[1:42:43] since there's nobody to argue with you
[1:42:45] you kind of calming down now you know
[1:42:46] like okay ain't nobody to fuss with i'm
[1:42:48] talking to myself like man i gotta find
[1:42:50] him somewhere to go boot camp something
[1:42:51] you know because your mind is in the
[1:42:53] future you thinking this gonna be a
[1:42:54] young man one day you know how in the
[1:42:56] world we'll handle this so
[1:42:58] all these thoughts are in my mind boot
[1:43:00] camp army everything you know you're
[1:43:02] trying to figure out the future in five
[1:43:04] seconds or five minutes right so i'm
[1:43:06] like man you know so anyway i go in my
[1:43:08] room
[1:43:09] and uh some something happens to me
[1:43:12] while i'm in the heat of my moment
[1:43:13] something just stops me and say pray for
[1:43:14] him because you just put him out you
[1:43:16] know
[1:43:17] so i started praying oh my god i'm so
[1:43:18] mad right now and i
[1:43:20] i'm so mad i don't want to calm down but
[1:43:22] lord
[1:43:23] he's out there lord jesus and i i'm i'm
[1:43:25] sorry but please just do something for
[1:43:27] him lord do something for me because i'm
[1:43:28] really upset and um you know i i don't
[1:43:31] feel right about this whole thing you
[1:43:33] know so
[1:43:34] uh while i'm praying
[1:43:36] i get a phone call and i thought it was
[1:43:39] him because it was an unknown number so
[1:43:40] i pick it up and it's actually uh
[1:43:42] another sister
[1:43:44] and she asked me you know how i'm doing
[1:43:45] so i just kept it real when i'm like you
[1:43:47] know right now i'm just really upset man
[1:43:48] my son got into and i just told him to
[1:43:49] get out
[1:43:50] and um she said sister you know um i'm
[1:43:53] gonna tell you something
[1:43:55] and she said i know you're upset right
[1:43:56] now but um
[1:43:58] you know he's 14 years old and for him
[1:44:01] to be out there
[1:44:03] that can be a domino effect because i
[1:44:05] used to she said she used to work for
[1:44:06] the authorities or whatever she said if
[1:44:07] something happened to him while he's out
[1:44:09] there they're gonna come to you
[1:44:10] she said um i know you're upset right
[1:44:12] now but
[1:44:13] just calm down and she told me a few
[1:44:15] testimonies about her and her kids she
[1:44:16] got some older kids too she said just
[1:44:18] just love on him when he called just
[1:44:20] love on him forgive him he need a place
[1:44:22] to feel safe right now you know he's a
[1:44:23] teenager he might be going through stuff
[1:44:25] and he's just not communicating with you
[1:44:27] and you just don't understand everything
[1:44:28] because you know they don't always share
[1:44:29] everything and she said just love on him
[1:44:31] don't even worry about the hole in the
[1:44:32] wall tell him something like you know
[1:44:33] you needed him walls knocked down anyway
[1:44:35] he can probably knock down the rest of
[1:44:36] the wall so you're going to make it
[1:44:38] bigger than that so she just gave me
[1:44:39] like a sense of humor with it and um
[1:44:41] should i just love on him for giving
[1:44:42] don't even worry about it you know sis
[1:44:44] just forgive him and and let him know
[1:44:46] you're here for him if he need you and
[1:44:48] you can talk to him and just let him
[1:44:49] feel safe where he can come to you and
[1:44:51] talk to you if he needs to you know
[1:44:52] because you never know what they're
[1:44:53] going through
[1:44:54] and i'm listening to her and i know
[1:44:56] she's ministering to me and in my spirit
[1:44:58] i feel like it is so true you know it's
[1:45:00] so true and i'm calming down more and
[1:45:02] more and i'm like yeah you know man you
[1:45:03] know
[1:45:04] so i get another phone call while she's
[1:45:06] talking and it's isaac and isaac's like
[1:45:08] mom i'm so sorry i love you and i
[1:45:10] apologize and um i'm so sorry you know i
[1:45:13] i'm sorry about the hole in the wall and
[1:45:15] everything so by this time i'm calm so
[1:45:17] i'm like you know i was like i'm i'm so
[1:45:18] sorry too forgive me forgive me for
[1:45:20] getting like that and um and i love you
[1:45:22] so much and don't worry about the hole
[1:45:23] in the wall you know and where you at
[1:45:25] right now anyway he's like well i'm at
[1:45:26] my friend house i know their little
[1:45:27] friend was at he said well i'm over
[1:45:28] there right now so i can come get get

[1:45:33] okay just let me know and i can come get
[1:45:35] you if you're ready or whatever if you
[1:45:36] want to walk back so
[1:45:38] um he came home
[1:45:40] first of all i think the sister like
[1:45:41] sister thank you so much that was god
[1:45:43] that had you called just now you know
[1:45:45] and uh she
[1:45:47] isaac came home
[1:45:49] i love my son but we never loved on each
[1:45:52] other the way we did when he came home i
[1:45:54] mean we were just
[1:45:55] so
[1:45:56] i don't know how many times we hugged
[1:45:57] that night and just apologized to each
[1:45:59] other that night
[1:46:00] and it was god grace that stepped in
[1:46:02] when i was weak he's strong
[1:46:04] and he stepped in and he saved that
[1:46:06] situation when
[1:46:09] you know you just don't know what to do
[1:46:10] sometimes things just happen off track
[1:46:11] sometimes you're tired you're worried
[1:46:12] for the day you're just not handling
[1:46:14] things right i don't always handle it
[1:46:15] right but when god steps in his grace
[1:46:17] covers that whole thing
[1:46:19] and
[1:46:20] i don't remember man isaac ever really
[1:46:22] loving it on each other like that i know
[1:46:23] we love each other but god grace came in
[1:46:25] and just
[1:46:26] it was a whole difference it was it made
[1:46:28] me humble myself like you know i was
[1:46:29] isaac whenever i get upset i'll go for a
[1:46:31] ride i won't put you out like that
[1:46:33] anymore that's crazy you know what i'm
[1:46:34] worried i'm thinking about you know so
[1:46:36] um it's just got grace and i just wanted
[1:46:38] to share those things just just some
[1:46:40] everyday real life stuff you know while
[1:46:41] god helping me to grow and helping us to
[1:46:43] grow and showing grace when um
[1:46:46] when i don't know how to do it you know
