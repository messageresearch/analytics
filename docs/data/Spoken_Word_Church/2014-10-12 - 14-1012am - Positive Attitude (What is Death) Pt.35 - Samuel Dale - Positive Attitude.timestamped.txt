[8:44] amen 1
[8:46] Corinthians 15 we'll start reading in
[8:50] verse
[8:57] 51 behold I I show you a
[9:01] mystery we shall not all sleep we shall
[9:04] but we shall all be chained in a moment
[9:07] in a twinkling of an eye the last
[9:09] trunk for the trumpet shall sound and
[9:12] the dead shall be raised Incorruptible
[9:15] and we shall be changed for this
[9:17] corruptible must put on incorruption and
[9:20] this Mortal must put on
[9:23] immortality so when this corruptible
[9:25] shall have put on incorruption now watch
[9:28] when this
[9:30] and this Mortal when this Mortal shall
[9:32] have put on
[9:33] immortality then at that time not before
[9:37] after whatever right there shall be
[9:40] brought to P the saying that is written
[9:43] death is swallowed up in Victory oh
[9:46] death where is thy sting oh grave where
[9:48] is thy Victory The Sting of death is sin
[9:51] and the strength of sin is the law but
[9:54] thanks be to God which giv us us the
[9:56] victory through our Lord Jesus Christ
[9:59] you may be seated the Lord add his
[10:01] Blessing to the reading of the word
[10:04] amen
[10:06] now we have been talking
[10:12] about you
[10:14] know The Last
[10:18] Enemy that we see is to be destroyed is
[10:20] death
[10:23] right two
[10:25] babies oh okay
[10:28] a yeah oh yeah that is right hey we got
[10:31] a new visitor stand up and let us see
[10:34] the little
[10:37] visitor Sophia Rose Sophia Rose amen
[10:42] we're always glad to have our visitors
[10:44] with us you know even no matter how
[10:47] little they are they're still one of us
[10:50] and then they become a part of us all
[10:52] right amen just remember that uh
[10:54] remember Josiah you know he went out to
[10:57] I hope he's out there showing those
[10:59] brother how a elk hunt in Colorado so
[11:01] maybe we'll get a good report when he
[11:04] gets back
[11:05] amen but we've been talking about the
[11:07] life enemy to be destroyed is
[11:11] death now we tried to cover this last
[11:15] service on one thing for
[11:18] certainty the prophet says death is my
[11:24] victory amen now you never heard a man
[11:27] talk like that you know until the end
[11:30] time because he knew what it was but he
[11:33] said death can only pull me into the
[11:36] presence of God right well we shouldn't
[11:39] fear death amen because fear had torment
[11:43] see and that's the problem we get afraid
[11:46] and we do and and even scientifically
[11:49] speaking they'll tell you the doctors
[11:51] and the things will tell you that you
[11:53] know if you fear something then that
[11:56] will that will conquer you you're
[11:58] already conquered when you have that
[12:01] fear all right but see that Last Enemy
[12:04] to be destroyed is death all right
[12:07] then we know for a certainty that the
[12:11] Lord Jesus Christ conquered death hell
[12:15] the grave all things all right and then
[12:19] and when he did
[12:22] that he brought life and immortality to
[12:26] light through the gospel to word that we
[12:29] could understand all right but we know
[12:32] also that we're still
[12:34] dying so then there's something wrong
[12:38] somewhere right all right so the point
[12:41] is
[12:42] what by the new birth we are in the
[12:46] kingdom of God our soul is
[12:49] eternal all right it's already
[12:53] redeemed all right and we're page 45 or
[12:57] 49 if future WR waiting the the
[12:59] Redemption of the
[13:01] body all right now that was paid for at
[13:05] Calvary you remember we're not talking
[13:07] about something that's not done or a
[13:10] finished
[13:11] product we're talking about a finished
[13:14] product that's done but yet not totally
[13:16] been
[13:17] applied unto
[13:19] mankind I try to illustrate it always
[13:22] where you can think about it the
[13:24] salvation of
[13:25] Israel that will be on after we leave
[13:28] out of here the 100
[13:30] 144,000 but yet that salvation is
[13:33] already finished at
[13:35] Calvary but it wasn't
[13:38] applied all right now so then the body
[13:42] was redeemed Jesus Christ doesn't have
[13:44] to come back and die again the body is
[13:48] redeemed but it was not
[13:51] applied all right it's it's not been
[13:54] applied to mankind down through
[13:57] time of that L Redemption all right and
[14:03] you know I know for I know you think me
[14:06] wrong a lot of times to say things over
[14:09] and over but
[14:11] uh see you and I have got to come to a
[14:15] place that we
[14:19] can look death in the
[14:23] face and not let it be our
[14:28] conqueror
[14:30] let it be the point that if we die so
[14:33] what that's right that only takes me
[14:36] into the presence of the Lord is that
[14:37] what Paul was explaining you know he
[14:40] said for me now it's good for me to go
[14:43] on he said but for you it's needful that
[14:48] I stay here all right see then that you
[14:52] know we should get to the point you say
[14:54] but but we you know I'm I'm still afraid
[14:57] of dying well then there's something
[14:59] wrong with your spiritually
[15:02] speaking because you should not be
[15:05] allowing now and I try to make it plain
[15:07] and blunt we're not stupid idiots to
[15:10] walk out in front of a train and say I'm
[15:13] not afraid of dying no you
[15:15] stupid that's what you are that's as
[15:18] blunt as it can be all right that's
[15:21] tempting
[15:23] God it's not something happened that
[15:26] you're in a wreck or something just goes
[15:28] wrong and you get killed or you know
[15:31] that's not tempting God but when you're
[15:34] doing things like that see you're
[15:35] tempting him and and we're not supposed
[15:37] to do that that's right all right but
[15:40] see death is not to be it's not supposed
[15:44] to be
[15:47] um our
[15:50] uh what the things we're afraid
[15:53] of yeah we're
[15:56] human we're human beings
[15:59] we think of dying you know that even the
[16:02] Lord Jesus hanging or in the garden that
[16:06] the the thoughts of dying was prevalent
[16:09] in his
[16:12] mind and he
[16:14] prayed because he didn't understand it
[16:17] him being God in human flesh he prayed
[16:20] for it to be removed from
[16:22] him all
[16:25] right but yet still he turned around and
[16:28] looked back at it and said all right so
[16:31] be it all right well see then we
[16:35] shouldn't have that fear because that's
[16:38] what's got torment in
[16:40] it that was what I was trying to get
[16:42] across there Wednesday and trying to get
[16:45] it to the point that death can only take
[16:48] me into the presence of
[16:50] God all I I don't
[16:54] think any of us would like to live to be
[16:57] a couple of hundred years old
[16:59] if you do you sure are thinking kind of
[17:04] you know
[17:05] I it would be all right if we could uh
[17:09] remain uh
[17:12] healthy you know and keep the mind
[17:14] that's the one thing I want to keep all
[17:18] right but yet we know that won't
[17:21] happen so we don't want to live that
[17:23] long that's
[17:25] right you know we we we want to we want
[17:28] to do what we doing but my point has
[17:30] been what for 45 or 50 years that I've
[17:34] been trying to get this point across
[17:37] this end time people has a word to
[17:42] fulfill just as every other age had a
[17:44] word to
[17:46] fulfill all right then what is the word
[17:49] to be fulfilled in this
[17:50] age
[17:53] death to be destroyed
[17:55] am
[17:57] right you said said no Rapture Rapture
[18:01] is going
[18:03] away you see that's what we've got our
[18:05] mind on I I'll be glad one of days when
[18:07] we're raptured up well that's all right
[18:11] but remember there's got to be a change
[18:13] before Rapture all right and there's got
[18:16] to be a change in you and I
[18:19] amen see we're going to be changed as we
[18:22] read in a moment the twinkle of an eye
[18:26] when see then at that time
[18:30] it's brought to P death where your sting
[18:34] grave where your Victory you know
[18:36] because is still doing it it's still
[18:38] holding us it still has effect on you
[18:41] and I but it doesn't have any effect
[18:43] upon our
[18:45] soul that's one thing I want you to see
[18:48] you know it it doesn't have any effect
[18:51] upon the spiritual part of
[18:53] mankind right you know the New Birth has
[18:56] taken that
[18:57] away all right
[19:00] but yet it has the effect upon this part
[19:02] of us and that's the part of us that is
[19:06] to
[19:07] be has to come into Redemption all right
[19:11] now in that then we know the day and the
[19:15] hour that we're living and we know the
[19:17] word we must
[19:20] fulfill okay
[19:23] right or else we're going to go by the
[19:26] grave and somebody else is going to do
[19:29] it so why not us do it that's right why
[19:33] can't we believe that we are that part
[19:37] and to do it but now it's like I said
[19:39] you say well now brother D you've been
[19:41] preaching this all yeah because when I
[19:43] saw this message I saw that's what it is
[19:47] right this message is to destroy
[19:51] death all right but we got to find out
[19:54] what it
[19:57] is before it can be
[19:59] destroyed all right the great Apostle
[20:02] Paul would say this corruptible must put
[20:06] on
[20:07] incorruption all right now listen
[20:10] church this shouldn't be something hard
[20:13] to comprehend because you know we as
[20:17] coming out of organized religion and
[20:19] churches and things you know we believed
[20:23] that something was going to happen that
[20:26] we would be redeemed now we might have
[20:29] believed it in the form of of uh going
[20:32] to get a new one you know we might have
[20:36] had all of that involved but we still
[20:38] was thinking about
[20:40] it you know and still to the point of
[20:44] trying to talk about
[20:47] it and and you know you would hear
[20:50] people preach about and and believe that
[20:53] the soul was
[20:56] redeemed so this is not a something
[20:58] something that's a new
[21:02] doctrine it goes all the way back amen
[21:06] all right and see in that
[21:08] then we shouldn't be trying to I think
[21:12] what we're trying to do is we're trying
[21:14] to find a rabbit in a hat right or a bus
[21:18] pulling up or a some form to bring us to
[21:23] a
[21:25] change instead of just going day by day
[21:29] and walking right into
[21:32] it you
[21:33] know as we'll get to it tomorrow this
[21:36] afternoon through the revealed word
[21:38] right right right all right and see then
[21:40] you'll see why that I haven't been like
[21:42] the other most ministers are that just
[21:45] try to tantalize the people satisfy them
[21:47] keep them happy or beat them over the
[21:48] head to make them feel good you know
[21:50] preach CL hire dress clothes Etc you
[21:56] know and look back and see Sister
[21:59] Barbara I told her we're glad to have
[22:01] her back she's been gone for about
[22:04] nearly a month now so she we glad to
[22:07] have her back with us all right now but
[22:10] look what we're looking at after Paul is
[22:14] trying to explain something let's back
[22:17] up and just read the
[22:19] scriptures and just come right down
[22:22] through to a place to look at something
[22:26] that I want us to talk about I want us
[22:28] to talk talk about what is
[22:31] death I remember brother Mo years ago
[22:33] that was probably a
[22:36] 1960 uh I mean
[22:38] 6869 event he said if we don't find out
[22:42] what death is how are we going to know
[22:45] when it's destroyed
[22:47] right and I said amen so that's held on
[22:51] to me ever since then you know to think
[22:53] about but go ahead let's just read some
[22:55] scriptures thank God for the rain that
[22:58] we're getting
[22:59] it's y'all may not need it where you're
[23:01] at but we certainly do around
[23:04] Gillsville but let's read some
[23:06] scriptures and just follow the line and
[23:09] think about now this is what I want you
[23:11] to think
[23:12] about I want you to think about that
[23:15] they back there especially say Paul
[23:18] because of his his great you know
[23:21] prophetic abilities that he would see
[23:26] things and he would speak of it
[23:30] and as I've told you maybe sometimes he
[23:32] would speak of it and and you would
[23:35] think well he surely didn't see it
[23:37] really clear right there well I believe
[23:40] that cuz I believe that's the way God
[23:42] reveals things to you and I all right
[23:45] he'll open a door or a light comes on as
[23:47] we call it and you begin to see things
[23:49] but then after a while it that we find
[23:53] out that's just a
[23:55] background you know and that's why I've
[23:57] always tried to preach to you about
[23:58] former latter rain you realize you you
[24:01] you your former Reign is your teaching
[24:03] rign your latter rain is the quickening
[24:05] but you know as quick as that's
[24:06] quickening to you you know the next day
[24:08] that becomes
[24:10] former because it's just a background
[24:12] for whatever's coming
[24:14] next all right amen so now look at these
[24:17] look at what especially Paul would
[24:20] say and then think about what he is
[24:24] saying
[24:26] right all right so let's read it look
[24:30] all flesh is not the same
[24:34] flesh but there's one kind of Flesh of
[24:36] man another kind of Flesh of Beast and
[24:38] other fishes and other birds there are
[24:41] celestial bodies and there's bodies
[24:43] terrestrial but the glory of celestial
[24:46] is one and the glory of terrestrial is
[24:47] another you have you know you have
[24:50] theophanies you have literal bodies you
[24:53] have things you have um out in the world
[24:56] you have heavenly
[24:59] uh Celestial forms and natural forms and
[25:02] and all kind of things all right there's
[25:05] one glory of the sun another glory of
[25:07] the Moon and another glory of the stars
[25:09] for one different from another star in
[25:11] glory for one star different so also is
[25:14] the resurrection of the dead
[25:18] now why is he talking about moon
[25:23] stars um
[25:26] atmospheres uh flesh
[25:29] uh you
[25:31] know I mean we we all know that the
[25:35] animals are
[25:36] different right and and we know that if
[25:40] you just take the natural of it that
[25:42] there's heavenly bodies celestials and
[25:45] there's Earthly or terrestrial type of
[25:49] forms down here you know there's moons
[25:52] or
[25:54] Stars why would he tie that
[25:57] to and make his outstanding statement
[26:01] and so is the resurrection of the
[26:08] dead
[26:10] now he said it's sown in
[26:14] corruption is raised in
[26:16] incorruption all right that's sensible
[26:20] enough for us to understand what goes
[26:22] down is going to come back up that was
[26:25] one of the Mysteries that we needed
[26:28] because to us in organized religion we
[26:30] had it going down one thing and coming
[26:32] up another right so now it should be
[26:35] turning the light on as to see really
[26:38] what he's dealing with he's dealing with
[26:40] a great thing that in just a minute
[26:42] he'll
[26:43] say I speak to you of a
[26:48] mystery something that has not been made
[26:50] known and remember in the days when Paul
[26:53] was writing these things you had the
[26:56] Pharisees that believed in a
[27:00] Resurrection you had the Sadducees that
[27:02] didn't believe in the resurrection but
[27:04] did believe probably in a final day
[27:09] Resurrection because you know I mean
[27:12] basically all man believes in at least
[27:13] something happens all right but now
[27:17] think about what he's
[27:18] saying describing all of these things
[27:21] then he simply seems to drop to a great
[27:25] understanding so on so is the res
[27:28] resurrection of the dead right amen you
[27:31] know a lot of people back there
[27:33] probably uh talk to him about it but
[27:37] like I said there was the argument among
[27:39] this or among that and and by this time
[27:41] he already knew about you know Paul I
[27:44] mean Jesus saying I am the resurrection
[27:47] and the life he already knew about those
[27:50] things so he was not only speaking to
[27:52] Pharisees and Sadducees about their
[27:54] doctrinal issues he was speaking of
[27:57] things of the bride of Christ as we'd
[28:00] call her and by the time Paul comes
[28:02] along there was probably already
[28:05] doctrines in there because you remember
[28:07] who was it philetus and hus that was uh
[28:11] teaching that the resurrection had
[28:14] passed over in the book of Acts right
[28:18] and he had to deal with that so there
[28:20] was already a lot of things going
[28:22] on so he I guess one day he simply gets
[28:26] the idea and he says says wait a
[28:29] minute these
[28:31] Corinthians and that means correction
[28:34] you know he said they they need a lot of
[28:37] help so I better break this down so then
[28:39] he starts saying so is also the
[28:41] resurrection of the dead it is sown in
[28:44] corruption it is raised in
[28:47] incorruption simple
[28:49] matters now what I want you to think
[28:52] about you know maybe sometimes I need to
[28:55] preach a little bit on that simple
[28:57] matters
[28:59] in the Bible there's a lot of things
[29:01] that are very
[29:03] simple but yet we make them so
[29:09] deep to me an amazement of brother
[29:11] brandham talking and they ask him uh
[29:14] what is it let's see what was that one U
[29:17] please explain the translation of the
[29:20] Bri you remember that and the questions
[29:22] and answered you know what he said it's
[29:25] just a change y he started talking about
[29:29] it as a simple matter it's just a
[29:34] change all right a great
[29:38] mystery just a
[29:41] change I believe it's going to be so
[29:43] simple until the major part of people is
[29:47] going to miss it because of the
[29:49] Simplicity that's what I believe amen CU
[29:54] it's just simple but look it's SE a
[29:56] natural body is raised as spiritual body
[29:59] there is a natural body and there is a
[30:00] spiritual
[30:02] body all right so he's
[30:05] expressing about human you know the dead
[30:08] it goes down it comes back up whatever
[30:11] it is going down is whatever is coming
[30:13] back he's not explaining we're going to
[30:15] get a new one all right and look what
[30:18] then he goes to and so what is it
[30:20] written the first man Adam and you're
[30:23] talking about Resurrection do do you
[30:26] understand me he's talking about
[30:28] resurrection and he's done been through
[30:30] the moon the stars the the celestials
[30:33] and terrestrials
[30:35] and yeah
[30:38] right now he's talking about the
[30:40] resurrection and he said s and dishonor
[30:44] raised in honor you know shown in in and
[30:47] uh dishonor raised in you know shown in
[30:49] weakness raised in
[30:51] power so a natural body raised a
[30:54] spiritual
[30:56] body look what he drops back
[30:59] too so it is
[31:01] written the first man Adam was made a
[31:05] living
[31:07] Soul the last Adam was made a quickening
[31:16] spirit now he's got to explain
[31:21] something how be it that was not first
[31:25] which is
[31:26] spiritual
[31:28] now he's not saying that Jesus Christ
[31:30] didn't come first he's talking about
[31:34] creation
[31:36] right
[31:41] right not first how be it that was not
[31:44] first which is spiritual but that which
[31:46] is natural and afterward that which is
[31:49] spiritual Adam came
[31:52] first there was no need of the second
[31:55] Adam to come
[31:58] Jesus Christ unless the first Adam had
[32:02] fallen right all right and look the
[32:07] first man is of the earth earthy the
[32:09] second man is the Lord From
[32:15] Heaven now think about what he's he's
[32:18] explaining
[32:23] Resurrection see we could stop right
[32:25] there and and just preach for a long
[32:28] time on that basis
[32:30] that the first man Adam
[32:35] fell and would require
[32:38] Resurrection all right but the second
[32:42] man
[32:44] Adam is the god of
[32:48] Heaven he just went through those things
[32:50] as an example for you and I the first
[32:53] man is of the earth earthy the second
[32:55] man is the Lord From Heaven
[32:58] as is the
[33:00] Earthly such are they also that are
[33:03] Earthly and as is the Heavenly such are
[33:06] they also that are
[33:07] Heavenly and what and as we have borne
[33:11] the image of the
[33:14] Earthly we shall also bear the image of
[33:18] the
[33:19] Heavenly explaining
[33:23] Resurrection because without a
[33:26] resurrection
[33:30] you couldn't
[33:32] say corruptible but on
[33:37] incorruption if you think you're going
[33:39] to get you a new body see and don't
[33:43] think much about
[33:44] it there's a big portion of the people
[33:47] of this message still believe that after
[33:49] all the prophet has said about
[33:51] it all right
[33:53] amen a man quotes more than a brother
[33:56] random than I do and yet he believes
[33:58] we're going to get a new body and one of
[34:00] these days some way I tried to listen to
[34:02] it and he brought it around and he done
[34:05] it around this way and it went over that
[34:06] way and it turned back that way and
[34:08] finally after a while it got back
[34:10] together I I I just couldn't follow it
[34:14] it was too spiritual for
[34:16] me I was still too carnal I
[34:19] guess but now
[34:22] look explaining the
[34:26] resurrection yeah is that what he's
[34:29] explaining come on are you with
[34:32] me we're just taking scriptures I like
[34:34] to do this maybe I'll get back to this
[34:37] style one of these days I like to just
[34:39] take scriptures we do that on the on the
[34:42] uh Bible study I love to do that and
[34:45] just read scripture and just talk about
[34:48] it I like to read the scripture and just
[34:50] think about
[34:52] it i' like to just think now
[34:56] Paul you've gone through heavenlies
[34:59] you've gone through everything you've
[35:01] gone through animals you've gone through
[35:03] all of these
[35:05] beings to show us that there's a natural
[35:09] problem then you speak of a
[35:13] resurrection and then you tell us that
[35:15] it's sown and
[35:20] dishonor it's
[35:23] raised
[35:24] in
[35:26] Incorruptible y
[35:29] why Paul are you being so emphatic about
[35:33] it then he explains how that the
[35:36] resurrection can come because that first
[35:40] man Adam went down right
[35:44] amen all right it would do no good to
[35:46] raise him back up
[35:50] right
[35:52] right unless something takes place right
[35:56] so then it would require that the second
[35:59] Adam would come into
[36:01] being and that second Adam the first man
[36:04] would be
[36:08] Earthly but the second Adam would be
[36:11] Heavenly the god of Glory all right we
[36:15] can understand Earthly
[36:17] things but what about Heavenly things
[36:20] amen all right and as we have borne the
[36:24] image of the
[36:26] earthy we shall also bear the image of
[36:29] the Heavenly look where he's gone
[36:32] from you could go back into Abraham and
[36:36] talk about the stars and the and the
[36:38] things all to go with it but
[36:44] think once he gets that settled look
[36:48] what he says now this I say
[36:51] Brethren that flesh and blood cannot
[36:54] inherit the kingdom of God
[36:59] neither does corruption inherit
[37:03] incorruption if you had to put that life
[37:05] part on there look where you would be
[37:07] facing
[37:08] it you don't you don't read that away
[37:12] read it without the last part I'll get
[37:13] to that in a
[37:15] second flesh and bl blood shall not
[37:18] inherit the kingdom of
[37:24] God we
[37:26] know
[37:28] that one
[37:30] day flesh and blood will set in the
[37:34] Kingdom amen right we know spiritually
[37:42] speaking by the new
[37:45] birth you're not talking about this
[37:47] outward man right and spiritually
[37:52] speaking it's not blood in the
[37:55] Kingdom right it's a new birth amen
[37:58] right to bring us into the
[38:01] Kingdom
[38:03] right all right but Naturally Speaking
[38:07] there will be a
[38:12] day there will be a day
[38:17] come the Flesh and
[38:21] Blood you say Flesh and Blood said wait
[38:23] a minute now I got you because of this
[38:25] well just remember
[38:29] Jesus mentioned flesh and Bone when he
[38:32] raised so don't go that there ain't no
[38:34] blood there i' done been through all of
[38:36] that I've done heard all of that and
[38:37] organized we thought we thought boy
[38:39] that's a great Revelation look at
[38:42] there the blood is gone away and Jesus
[38:45] said touch me cuz the spirit hath not
[38:48] flesh and Bone said see there his blood
[38:50] was done
[38:53] gone Bo that's a great
[38:56] Revelation now
[38:58] that was carnality of mine trying to
[39:00] take scriptures but
[39:04] look flesh and blood cannot inherit the
[39:07] kingdom of
[39:09] God all right so now here we
[39:12] are but I I thought we believe that we
[39:16] that this body is going to be redeemed
[39:18] right come on all
[39:22] right so then he says I'll show you a
[39:26] mystery
[39:29] we're going to be
[39:31] changed this kind this human
[39:35] element 16
[39:38] elements is not going to be what we're
[39:42] talking
[39:43] about it's this body
[39:46] redeemed that we will live in we'll have
[39:49] a body like un to his own glorious body
[39:52] amen yes sir
[39:55] amen you see we think we got got it all
[39:57] figured
[39:58] out cuz look what he's
[40:01] saying he's saying flesh and blood
[40:04] cannot inherit the
[40:05] Kingdom wait a minute we going to get a
[40:08] new body no he's just
[40:12] explained
[40:14] right come on he's just
[40:17] explained corruptible Incorruptible
[40:20] right the same thing going from
[40:24] corruption to
[40:26] incorruption
[40:28] amen all right this Mortal is going to
[40:32] put on
[40:33] immortality
[40:36] right so it's this
[40:38] body
[40:40] redeemed and once it's redeemed it can
[40:43] walk in the
[40:44] Kingdom CU there's not going to be any
[40:47] literal thing in the Kingdom it's going
[40:50] to be this body made
[40:52] Eternal are you with
[40:55] me you said that will still be no that
[40:58] won't be natural that will be a
[41:01] supernatural
[41:03] being right Jesus Christ when he
[41:07] raised was a supernatural being not a
[41:11] natural being right amen all right and
[41:14] we're going to have a body like under
[41:15] his own glor all right amen just
[41:18] thinking about the
[41:20] scriptures and how that we missed
[41:26] it you know you said well now brother
[41:28] there we we believe that we we don't
[41:31] believe in getting a new
[41:32] body we believe in getting this body you
[41:36] know made Eternal
[41:40] okay but see then once this body is
[41:45] resurrected now are we back to where the
[41:47] Paul was on his message when this body
[41:50] is that we die and go by the grave the
[41:53] body will be resurrected right
[41:56] amen well now if the body is
[42:02] resurrected see that's why I love what
[42:04] he
[42:07] says look at the next one 51 behold I
[42:10] show you a mystery we shall not all
[42:14] sleep but we shall all be
[42:18] changed so when the dead is raised if he
[42:22] was raised back into a mortal
[42:25] body and stayed that it was hey what
[42:27] good would it
[42:30] be you
[42:33] know all of us are going to be changed
[42:36] right right all right now I've told you
[42:39] and I believe it I don't believe that
[42:41] the Dead's going to be raised in
[42:44] corrupted formed bodies I don't believe
[42:46] that now if you do that's all right you
[42:48] do what you want to I believe there
[42:51] resurrection and change will be together
[42:53] that's right I'm talking about those
[42:54] who've died and gone on there's no need
[42:57] bringing them up into uh corruptible
[43:00] because that wouldn't be
[43:02] right see Paul wouldn't be right that
[43:05] you know it goes down corruptible and
[43:07] comes up Incorruptible it's all right
[43:10] amen so now when the dead raise they
[43:13] will
[43:14] raise in a form that is not like death
[43:22] amen they're raised in the form of
[43:26] coming forth like he did
[43:28] amen when he said don't touch me and I'm
[43:31] not yet ascended there was something
[43:33] right in
[43:34] there but in just a little while they
[43:36] could touch him right amen all right but
[43:39] think about
[43:42] it flesh and blood cannot inherit the
[43:44] Kingdom well we got a
[43:46] scripture yeah you got a scripture
[43:48] staring you in the face it's got to be
[43:49] made known right what if it's
[43:53] not did you
[43:55] see neither does corruption inherit
[43:58] incorruption then he makes a statement
[44:01] behold I show you a
[44:03] mystery
[44:05] right a mystery
[44:09] about the resurrection in the
[44:14] things he just described we're not going
[44:16] to get a new one
[44:19] right he just went through this one is
[44:21] going to go down come up Incorruptible
[44:24] right all right but even though it comes
[44:27] up
[44:30] Incorruptible are you following me the
[44:33] dead will rais
[44:35] Incorruptible but they'll have to be
[44:38] changed right you said well why is the
[44:41] purpose of the change well
[44:46] evidently we're going to be a
[44:49] supernatural people
[44:52] right we're not going to be dealing with
[44:54] natural things anymore right amen
[44:57] right a supernatural
[45:01] people like him right a body like unto
[45:05] his own glorious body that we can stand
[45:08] there in that day but you see what I'm
[45:10] talking about look where we'd be if he
[45:12] had have made the
[45:14] statement but we
[45:17] shall be
[45:19] changed all right now once he makes his
[45:24] statement I didn't mean to go this way I
[45:27] just brought the scriptures cuz I wanted
[45:28] to get over the notes but bear with
[45:32] me once he makes his
[45:36] statement that you be changed in a
[45:38] moment of M the
[45:40] mystery in a moment of twinkling of an
[45:43] eye now he describes how it's going to
[45:45] take place when it's going to take place
[45:47] what Etc all
[45:49] right and the dead shall be raised
[45:52] Incorruptible and we shall be changed he
[45:56] just said in verse 51 that we'll all be
[45:59] changed right shall all be changed now
[46:02] he's double stating to make sure we
[46:05] don't miss it he's stating that we shall
[46:07] be
[46:09] changed all right CU we're not going to
[46:12] have to die
[46:15] right right amen we're going from
[46:18] corruptible to Incorruptible while we're
[46:20] standing here without a death burial
[46:22] Resurrection
[46:24] things right all right
[46:28] right now watch what he sums it up with
[46:30] and I love this for this corruptible
[46:34] must put on
[46:38] incorruption and this Mortal must put on
[46:43] immortality
[46:45] now do you realize what Paul has just
[46:50] done you see I know that everybody don't
[46:52] think the way I think and I'm glad of
[46:55] that but
[46:58] as I said I love to just sit down and
[47:00] look at those
[47:02] scriptures with all of the background of
[47:04] the prophet's message that will keep me
[47:07] straight in my line you know and I won't
[47:11] run off into something looking for a
[47:14] great
[47:16] mystery that nobody else ain't never
[47:22] seen I just look at the
[47:25] scripture
[47:27] Paul says behold I show you a
[47:31] mystery we shall not all sleep but we
[47:34] shall all be
[47:37] changed now
[47:39] watch in a moment in the twinkling of an
[47:44] eye at the LI Trump for the trumpet
[47:46] shall sound and the dead shall be raised
[47:48] Incorruptible and we shall be
[47:52] changed now he drops back
[47:55] down
[48:00] come on read your scripture he drops
[48:02] back down from the great height that he
[48:05] just
[48:06] went because the height he just went is
[48:09] Rapture and everything
[48:11] right CU we're going to be
[48:15] changed now I tried to explain something
[48:18] one
[48:19] time and uh I thought people would
[48:22] understand it
[48:25] and
[48:28] you call
[48:31] interpolating maybe it means nothing to
[48:33] M of you but it means a lot to
[48:37] me a lot of things are interpolated or
[48:40] brought into
[48:42] clarification is a better way of saying
[48:44] it for us to have a better
[48:47] understanding now look at the height
[48:49] Paul has taken us
[48:51] to changed the next thing would be the
[48:55] Rapture right right are you with me come
[48:59] on the next thing for the change is the
[49:02] rapture right we all changed so
[49:05] everything be standing here and Paul
[49:08] looks at that and he
[49:10] says oh they're not going to understand
[49:15] that and look what he
[49:18] says for this corruptible must put on
[49:24] incorruption this Mortal must put on
[49:29] immortality now I'm going to say
[49:31] something in a minute that you're going
[49:32] to you know a lot of you going to go hey
[49:34] wi so go
[49:36] ahead so
[49:39] when this corruptible shall I put on
[49:43] incorruption
[49:46] when now he's already brought you to a
[49:54] change I don't know where the Brothers
[49:56] can do it back there or not but I'll get
[49:58] to it in a minute and this Mortal shall
[50:00] I put on immortality then shall be
[50:03] brought to Pisces saying it is written
[50:06] death is swallowed up in
[50:08] Victory
[50:12] y now you say well okay you realize if
[50:17] you took verse
[50:20] 52 bring it put 53 and 54 and
[50:31] 52 are you with
[50:34] me well what does that mean it don't
[50:37] mean nothing to you if you don't
[50:38] understand
[50:40] it but you see he just went to the
[50:43] change then he drop
[50:46] back to tell us how to come to a change
[50:50] hey they done it all
[50:53] right and brother's getting sharp look
[50:56] what you'd be reading behold I show you
[50:59] mystery we shall not all sleep but we
[51:01] shall all be changed so you just kind of
[51:02] hold that point for this corruptible
[51:04] must foot on incorrupt there Mor foot on
[51:06] so when this happens that there Mor foot
[51:09] on then shall be brought to P the saying
[51:11] death is swallowed up in Victory in a
[51:14] moment a twinkle of an eye at the life
[51:16] Trump where the trumpet shall sound and
[51:17] the dead shall be raised in and we shall
[51:19] be
[51:25] changed
[51:27] but you see it had to be left the other
[51:28] way so flick it back where nobody won't
[51:31] think we're trying to change things to
[51:33] make it different it has to be left to
[51:36] where it's hidden from the eyes of the
[51:38] wise and
[51:39] prudent but reveal to them that are to
[51:44] receive it in the last days CU we know
[51:47] that this Mortal must put on immortality
[51:50] and we know this corruptible must put on
[51:52] incorruption we know the dead has to
[51:55] raise we know that we all and then we're
[51:58] changed then we go meet the Lord in the
[52:01] air all
[52:03] right see then you can
[52:12] say see when the dead stand
[52:15] here that are raised
[52:20] up when the Mortal puts on
[52:23] immortality the dead are
[52:25] raised
[52:28] brother said if we see him amen we know
[52:31] we're
[52:32] going so we know we're not looking for a
[52:34] resurrection in us because really that
[52:37] Resurrection has brought that to P in us
[52:40] we get to that this
[52:43] evening but we're standing
[52:47] here
[52:55] changed we're going to stand here on
[52:57] this Earth change sister
[53:00] Gil maybe it Split Second who
[53:04] worries the dead can be among us 30 40
[53:07] days proving the resurrection has
[53:10] come all right I explained the best I
[53:13] could a moment ago that they're not
[53:15] going to raise in some kind of a body
[53:18] that's incorrupt you know corruptible
[53:20] they're going to raise Incorruptible
[53:23] right amen but there's something about
[53:25] that we need to change right
[53:30] amen CU Paul emphatically stated it
[53:32] twice
[53:34] there that we're going to all be
[53:39] changed all right when the dead appears
[53:41] among
[53:45] us we can look at that and say as Paul
[53:49] would say when this
[53:52] corruptible the Resurrection comes so
[53:56] shall have put on incorruption mhm right
[53:59] and this Mortal shall have put on
[54:01] immortality brought up not brought up in
[54:05] an old
[54:07] body come
[54:10] on then at that
[54:15] time shall be brought to P the saying
[54:17] that is written death is swallowed up in
[54:20] Victory
[54:22] amen if the dead don't
[54:25] raise
[54:28] is that further in the
[54:30] scripture and Paul said if the dead
[54:32] don't raise then where are we and who
[54:33] are we and look what trouble we're in
[54:37] amen right if the dead don't
[54:41] raise I thought we believe that this end
[54:43] time bride I thought we believe that
[54:46] shout voice of an archangel and the
[54:49] trumpet it goes into
[54:54] Thessalonians was to be in our day
[54:58] and that the bride would be the final
[55:00] voice to the final age amen and the
[55:04] voice of the Resurrection would be in
[55:06] the bride
[55:08] believe see that's the resurrection we
[55:12] need
[55:14] okay we don't have to stand here as a
[55:17] resurrection we don't die and jump right
[55:19] back
[55:22] up
[55:24] no but I'm going to make a statement now
[55:28] that I never made so
[55:31] okay when they raise and we see
[55:37] it we're going to be the closest youve
[55:40] ever
[55:42] come to
[55:45] Eternal
[55:47] position they could ever
[55:52] be ain't going to be no dying then you
[55:55] tell me when the dead raise you're going
[55:57] to keep on dying not in Bride form now
[56:00] forget it you can take this for what you
[56:02] want to the bride form there's not going
[56:05] to be any dying when the raise the
[56:08] Resurrection comes amen cuz that is the
[56:11] point to prove Paul says that death is
[56:15] swallowed up in
[56:21] Victory death where's you sting did he
[56:23] go on and say it grave where's you
[56:25] victory that's
[56:28] right would you understand what I'm
[56:30] saying
[56:31] yes you understand what I've been
[56:33] pointing at for 40 something years when
[56:36] that dead
[56:38] raises we going to be there still old
[56:44] yeah right CU remember 30 40
[56:48] days it's not 30 40 days that we're
[56:50] changed and then we walk
[56:52] off you got to get that in a moment the
[56:54] twinkle of an eye
[56:58] they're
[56:59] raised they appear Among
[57:02] Us the prophet said when you see them
[57:04] said you know you're going yep
[57:07] amen cuz you go tell somebody else you
[57:10] know I go somebody goes and tell Mark
[57:12] said Mark I've seen the dead raise if he
[57:15] ain't born again he can't see
[57:19] it you see the importance of the new
[57:21] birth right amen if we don't have that
[57:24] then we're not going to see it no that's
[57:26] right it'll be another dimension and we
[57:28] can't follow
[57:30] it all right but the dead in Christ you
[57:36] rise be here for a period of
[57:40] time and that 340 days you going to say
[57:43] brother Dale yep we're going to still be
[57:45] getting up and we still going to be
[57:47] eating and we still going to be getting
[57:55] older
[57:58] that stopped you hard is
[58:00] it still going to be getting
[58:04] older but something's going to happen
[58:06] then and we'll be
[58:10] changed but that's after the
[58:15] resurrection see we're not changing in
[58:17] the dead race get in the right
[58:21] order the dead in Christ you rise
[58:25] first and we which are alive and
[58:28] remain are going to be changed and then
[58:31] caught up we talk about the Rapture why
[58:33] we're about the Rapture why not stay on
[58:35] the
[58:36] resurrection that's it cuz they got to
[58:39] be here before we can go any
[58:41] further so the importance is whether or
[58:44] not the bride can become the word that's
[58:48] right
[58:51] right he said but my problem is brother
[58:54] Dale I've got you our problem
[58:57] is the rest of the
[58:59] scripture all right pick it on back up
[59:02] there in
[59:06] Corinthians pull back up to
[59:10] Corinthians now watch so when this
[59:13] corruptible shall I put on
[59:15] incorruption and this Mortal shall I put
[59:18] on
[59:20] immortality then shall be brought to
[59:23] pass the saying that is written death is
[59:26] swallowed up in Victory have you ever
[59:28] read that in the
[59:32] Bible roll it up Brothers is the next
[59:37] quote one
[59:40] C which is Isaiah
[59:43] 2589 he will swallow up death in
[59:48] Victory now watch it get right here with
[59:53] us all
[59:55] right
[59:56] right
[1:00:00] here he will swallow up death in Victory
[1:00:04] and the Lord God will wipe away tears
[1:00:06] from all faces amen and the rebuke of
[1:00:09] his people shall he take away from off
[1:00:13] the Earth for the Lord has spoken
[1:00:16] it and it shall be said in that
[1:00:19] day Lo This Is Our
[1:00:24] God we have waited for
[1:00:27] him and he will save us redeemed
[1:00:32] right this is the Lord we have waited
[1:00:35] for him we be glad and rejoice in his
[1:00:37] salvation amen
[1:00:40] right Paul said it's
[1:00:43] written death would be swallowed up in
[1:00:46] Victory Isaiah speaking of an end time
[1:00:53] bride a group of people
[1:00:58] they can say this is my
[1:01:02] God this is what we waited
[1:01:07] for
[1:01:09] right all right
[1:01:15] now so he
[1:01:17] says when death is
[1:01:21] destroyed you
[1:01:24] know and remember
[1:01:27] death is not destroyed until the
[1:01:28] Resurrection comes right amen right so
[1:01:33] now you're tying it to the flesh
[1:01:37] right Last Enemy to be destroyed is
[1:01:39] death the death to be
[1:01:42] destroyed is this flesh here but when
[1:01:47] they
[1:01:49] raise if you just went with us and some
[1:01:52] change look where you'd be you'd leave
[1:01:55] everything out so they come first that's
[1:01:59] right and when they raise 30 40 days
[1:02:03] right you remember what I said while ago
[1:02:06] that'd be the closest you ever got to
[1:02:07] Eternity y cuz you realize when you see
[1:02:12] them
[1:02:12] raised death is
[1:02:19] defeated only when the Resurrection
[1:02:23] comes only when that Resurrection ction
[1:02:26] comes into being would Death be
[1:02:31] destroyed come on it's not just you and
[1:02:33] I that no but you see we are the ones
[1:02:37] who has to bring forth the message so
[1:02:40] now let's get to
[1:02:43] that so what is
[1:02:49] death remember we're not talking about
[1:02:51] us
[1:02:54] dying we're talking about when the dead
[1:02:59] raises death where you sting grave where
[1:03:02] you Victory it's annihilated in the
[1:03:05] resurrection of the Bride of Jesus
[1:03:08] Christ let me put it this way it's
[1:03:10] proved that it's done it was done back
[1:03:12] there we know that we know what he done
[1:03:15] but he's going to apply it in the end
[1:03:17] time he's going to raise the
[1:03:21] dead amen now I could spend about three
[1:03:24] hours
[1:03:26] talking about the son of
[1:03:30] man because remember the reason he's
[1:03:34] called son of man he had the
[1:03:36] resurrection message right
[1:03:40] amen Lazarus was proof of it
[1:03:45] right the son of man hath
[1:03:48] power on
[1:03:50] Earth to raise the
[1:03:53] dead amen so then I thought we believed
[1:03:58] at least I
[1:03:59] do that in the end time the bride must
[1:04:02] be the son of man that's right amen the
[1:04:07] word made flesh that's
[1:04:09] right it's going to be her that will
[1:04:12] call the Dead from the grave I
[1:04:17] believe when she becomes what she's
[1:04:19] supposed to
[1:04:21] be Amen Let me put it a little deeper
[1:04:23] more when she really really realizes who
[1:04:26] she is that's it
[1:04:29] amen that's why everything's waiting on
[1:04:31] you and I amen yes sir
[1:04:34] absolutely amen all
[1:04:37] right so what is
[1:04:42] death brother brandom says that there's
[1:04:45] a great big dark
[1:04:47] hole that's out in front of all of
[1:04:51] us and said every man is walking into
[1:04:54] that hole and said it's called
[1:04:59] Death he said because death is taking
[1:05:03] us and no matter what we think it took
[1:05:07] him is taking
[1:05:10] Mankind through that dark hole of death
[1:05:18] right he said I want to be like a hero
[1:05:20] when it comes my
[1:05:23] time he said I want to say like Paul
[1:05:26] I know him in the power of his
[1:05:31] resurrection was that what Paul said a't
[1:05:34] that kind of an odd statement to be
[1:05:35] fitting where we're talking about a
[1:05:38] resurrection every one of us is headed
[1:05:40] to
[1:05:46] death what is
[1:05:49] death
[1:05:50] life
[1:05:53] perverted all right we're good at that
[1:05:55] one
[1:05:58] we're good on that one
[1:06:02] right but just
[1:06:06] remember Revelation go ahead let's read
[1:06:09] that one number seven brother I'm trying
[1:06:11] to cut some things out where we can get
[1:06:15] through and when he had opened the
[1:06:17] fourth seal I heard the voice of the
[1:06:18] fourth Beast say come and see and I
[1:06:21] looked and behold a Pale Horse and his
[1:06:24] name that set on him him was death and
[1:06:27] Hell Followed With Him said hell always
[1:06:31] followed death power is given over him
[1:06:34] the part would look at
[1:06:39] him in his name that set on him was
[1:06:44] death why would brother
[1:06:46] brandham State these
[1:06:51] things look number
[1:06:54] eight
[1:06:56] paragraph 117 of the fourth
[1:06:58] seal none of the other horses or no time
[1:07:02] that this rider ever rode they didn't
[1:07:05] have that man had no name there was no
[1:07:08] name down Through the
[1:07:10] Ages but now he is called death it's not
[1:07:15] mentioned see it's revealed now what he
[1:07:19] is is
[1:07:23] death going to number nine
[1:07:26] it's not mentioned in the other times of
[1:07:28] this writer but said it's mentioned that
[1:07:30] he's called
[1:07:32] death but under the Revelation see under
[1:07:34] the revelation of the line you have to
[1:07:36] follow get down to the next part it's
[1:07:39] not under the revelation of the line
[1:07:40] it's not under the revelation of the man
[1:07:42] not under the revelation of the ox not
[1:07:45] under the Revelation come on I'm
[1:07:47] reading First Age early age this wasn't
[1:07:52] revealed the next age was the age of the
[1:07:54] ox which is a Dark Age the middle age it
[1:07:57] wasn't revealed so as what it
[1:08:01] was nor the manlike Beast of wisdom
[1:08:05] representing the reformers Luther and
[1:08:07] Wesley and so forth it wasn't revealed
[1:08:10] but in the eagle age the last age the
[1:08:13] prophetic age when there is to rise
[1:08:16] prophetic utterance to whom the secrets
[1:08:19] always come that's right amen going down
[1:08:22] to the fifth seal number 10 and it says
[1:08:26] changing these three
[1:08:28] times and made a Pale Horse and then
[1:08:30] given a name called
[1:08:34] death
[1:08:36] death why would he state so much about
[1:08:39] it
[1:08:40] being the fourth the
[1:08:43] eagle the others didn't call him
[1:08:46] death now you know they knew what dying
[1:08:50] was right right you know Paul had spoke
[1:08:53] of the things that he said when why
[1:08:55] would it brother random talk about in
[1:08:57] his
[1:09:00] message that that eagle would know what
[1:09:02] death
[1:09:04] is you remember I've always told you we
[1:09:08] call death you know well so and so died
[1:09:10] we took them to the Undertaker and we go
[1:09:12] to see him and visit him oh he died
[1:09:15] that's not death because the soul of
[1:09:17] that individual can't
[1:09:19] die no matter if he's a sinner his soul
[1:09:23] doesn't die it goes to another
[1:09:25] Dimension another place and
[1:09:30] waits that's
[1:09:32] right we'll get to that this
[1:09:35] evening but what is death what killed
[1:09:44] Eve
[1:09:49] unbelief see brother brandom was the
[1:09:51] only one who really caught what death
[1:09:54] was
[1:09:56] that's why he'd say he'd say
[1:09:59] look death is my
[1:10:03] victory it just carries me into the
[1:10:06] presence of
[1:10:07] God I shouldn't fear it it's my helper
[1:10:12] you remember
[1:10:16] Wednesday I'm not he said his
[1:10:20] slave that's what we said Wednesday we
[1:10:23] read he said he's my
[1:10:26] slave you know that death can't touch
[1:10:29] you until God gets to with you it don't
[1:10:31] make no difference what you could be in
[1:10:34] the middle of where an atam bomb fell on
[1:10:36] top of your head and blowed the world
[1:10:40] apart it can't kill you until God gets
[1:10:43] true with you so why are you afraid of
[1:10:46] if he's true with you why you why don't
[1:10:48] you want to go on to be with him that's
[1:10:50] what Paul was
[1:10:51] saying oh no no none of us ain't the
[1:10:53] only reason I live is for you you my
[1:10:56] family where's the other it doesn't
[1:10:59] matter to
[1:11:00] me why because it was settled a long
[1:11:02] time ago right at least I know what
[1:11:05] death to the soul
[1:11:07] was we were all born in
[1:11:10] unbelief he that believeth not is
[1:11:13] condemned already he's dead already if
[1:11:16] you're not born again you're dead in sin
[1:11:19] and
[1:11:20] trespasses
[1:11:23] right but then
[1:11:26] see what is death
[1:11:31] unbelief
[1:11:33] unbelief that's
[1:11:35] right now there's two points to cover on
[1:11:39] that
[1:11:41] one the reason we have
[1:11:44] unbelief is because we have not a lot of
[1:11:48] times been made uh the truth has not
[1:11:52] been made known that's right all right
[1:11:54] right now God Winks at
[1:11:59] that right but one day he commands all
[1:12:02] to repent all right lack of
[1:12:08] understanding is still death right amen
[1:12:11] but yet there's an excuse there that we
[1:12:13] don't
[1:12:15] understand and that's where the biggest
[1:12:17] portion of people of this message are
[1:12:19] setting right that's why I said 40 years
[1:12:22] ago the biggest portion of people in
[1:12:24] message going to die go by the
[1:12:27] grave you've probably heard that 15 20
[1:12:30] times if you've been around here 5
[1:12:34] years so if I said it 5 years ago that'd
[1:12:38] still be well enough but I said it about
[1:12:43] 40 Sister Christine could probably give
[1:12:45] you the page number out of the seal
[1:12:52] book I KN is your name in it Christine
[1:12:54] okay boy I got that
[1:12:58] right but
[1:13:02] listen there's only one death what
[1:13:05] killed Eve brother around said
[1:13:08] unbelief now it first killed her
[1:13:11] spiritually
[1:13:14] right it first killed her spiritually
[1:13:17] she went into
[1:13:19] unbelief but then because of that
[1:13:21] unbelief she eventually died
[1:13:26] the first murder was because of unbelief
[1:13:28] and that was Cain and Abel the first
[1:13:31] death as we want to call it that way
[1:13:34] physical so what brother R said what
[1:13:37] killed Eve he said
[1:13:44] unbelief he said the life's plague to
[1:13:46] strike this lady o seean age would be
[1:13:50] spiritual
[1:13:52] death be glad to give you that quote
[1:13:56] spiritual death would strike the lady of
[1:13:58] see and age and you can pretty well see
[1:14:01] that
[1:14:05] amen it's not that we're going to say
[1:14:09] death being destroyed is to do away with
[1:14:11] unbelief I don't have no unbelief no
[1:14:12] more so I can't
[1:14:14] die now we just been through the whole
[1:14:17] message explaining that even
[1:14:20] after we get in this message and all the
[1:14:23] great things are made known to us until
[1:14:26] that dead raises
[1:14:29] right we're going to be
[1:14:31] dying right all right your Prophet had
[1:14:36] to
[1:14:38] die all
[1:14:41] right so it's not to say well boy bless
[1:14:44] God one of these days I don't have no
[1:14:46] unbelief I'm not going to die you're
[1:14:48] just bluffing
[1:14:52] it let them get a gun stick of your head
[1:14:54] you find out that wor Bluff or
[1:14:56] not that's right
[1:15:01] right sin is
[1:15:05] death and sin is unbelief
[1:15:11] right sin is unbelief lack of
[1:15:17] understanding is a sin but it's not a
[1:15:21] sin under
[1:15:23] death now listen
[1:15:26] lack of understanding other words we
[1:15:27] don't know we we haven't heard that's
[1:15:30] not the sin unto death the sin unto
[1:15:32] death is when truth is made known
[1:15:34] right when truth is made known and we
[1:15:38] face it then we've come to the
[1:15:41] possibility of death
[1:15:44] right
[1:15:46] right and we're going to get to it this
[1:15:48] afternoon that death in hell will even
[1:15:51] be cast into the Lake of Fire so you
[1:15:54] know death's going to be destroyed one
[1:15:59] day all
[1:16:01] right but you see unbelief is what's
[1:16:05] taking you and I
[1:16:07] down all
[1:16:10] right that's why I try to give you the
[1:16:13] quotes I try to help you as much as I
[1:16:14] can I try to keep preaching on something
[1:16:17] over and over to try to give you an
[1:16:19] opportunity to not face it as an
[1:16:22] unbeliever because I know and realize
[1:16:24] sometimes when I speak that a lot of
[1:16:26] people sitting in the congregation are
[1:16:28] listening are saying I don't believe
[1:16:33] that or let me put it in the word word I
[1:16:37] don't understand
[1:16:39] that that's too
[1:16:45] deep I mean we just went through the
[1:16:47] scriptures today reading the scripture
[1:16:49] but it's too
[1:16:51] deep this
[1:16:53] messenger
[1:16:55] was the one to tell us what death is is
[1:16:58] that
[1:17:02] deep you what you're saying is we didn't
[1:17:06] understand the thing that was killing
[1:17:12] us we called it
[1:17:17] denominations and we say but brother
[1:17:20] Dale don't throw off on them they are
[1:17:23] good people do not denominations are not
[1:17:25] good
[1:17:28] people people in denominations are good
[1:17:31] people denominations is
[1:17:35] death well that's all no it ain't all
[1:17:37] the same why the prophet said I'm not
[1:17:41] against you and your system you're doing
[1:17:44] but he said the system of organized
[1:17:48] religion is what I'm against why because
[1:17:51] he knew that it was
[1:17:53] death
[1:17:57] am maybe the seals had to open before he
[1:17:59] really seen what that
[1:18:02] was but he saw death as no man that's
[1:18:05] why the eagle tells us then what is
[1:18:09] death it's not dying going to the
[1:18:13] Undertaker
[1:18:15] uhuh that's my victory to get me out of
[1:18:17] here that's something to do away the old
[1:18:20] age and on my facings and doings
[1:18:23] and that's this thing to get me in the
[1:18:25] presence of
[1:18:30] God Brother D I didn't know we had to
[1:18:33] conquer
[1:18:35] death well now you
[1:18:40] do now you know
[1:18:43] that we going to have to conquer it now
[1:18:46] can I back up in the message just a
[1:18:49] second you was following me a while ago
[1:18:52] so let's see if you keep
[1:18:53] following
[1:18:56] when the dead
[1:18:58] raises when the dead is
[1:19:02] raised and appears Among Us I said
[1:19:05] you're the closest you'll ever be to
[1:19:08] Eternity without actually being there
[1:19:11] you kind of at least grinned about it
[1:19:14] whether you believed it or not I think
[1:19:16] most of you did all
[1:19:20] right so then for about 30 40 days
[1:19:23] somebody
[1:19:28] let me put it this way the dead is not
[1:19:29] going to raise until the Bride of Jesus
[1:19:31] Christ conquers death that's
[1:19:36] right the dead ain't going to raise
[1:19:38] until till the death is conquered here
[1:19:40] in the flesh that's why I said it like I
[1:19:43] did when the Resurrection comes there
[1:19:46] won't be no death after
[1:19:48] then to the Bride of Jesus
[1:19:51] Christ why because death will have
[1:19:54] already OT sting swallowed
[1:19:56] up you agreed with that a moment ago but
[1:19:59] can you agree that we are the ones that
[1:20:00] has to be
[1:20:02] that we have to know what death is for
[1:20:06] to be able to destroy it that's right
[1:20:09] and death is our
[1:20:12] unbelief
[1:20:15] doubting
[1:20:18] wondering if a dumb donkey tells you the
[1:20:21] truth you ought at least say Amen right
[1:20:24] amen
[1:20:26] that's
[1:20:28] right the truth is what you're talking
[1:20:31] about
[1:20:32] amen if I die and go to hell let it be
[1:20:35] said one thing for since I've been in
[1:20:37] this message and you know it the takes
[1:20:39] are there to prove it I have fought for
[1:20:41] one thing you and I have a message in
[1:20:44] this day of something that we've got to
[1:20:46] make
[1:20:47] manifest amen we have been delivered to
[1:20:51] message by the prophet that's right we
[1:20:54] have the holy spirit from God to reveal
[1:20:58] it
[1:21:02] am but it's up to you and I to take it
[1:21:06] amen and get away from our little
[1:21:08] unbelief or Petty
[1:21:11] ideas he said no I don't I don't well
[1:21:13] why did you think that hell was
[1:21:18] eternal where'd you get that at ain't in
[1:21:21] the
[1:21:23] Bible
[1:21:28] right but you know what a lot of people
[1:21:31] say the Bible
[1:21:33] says every tub was set on its own
[1:21:40] bottom mama told me that Grandpa told me
[1:21:42] that Uncle I know it's in
[1:21:48] there no ain't in
[1:21:52] there can't tell the difference in the
[1:21:55] season except the shedding of the trees
[1:21:56] but of the leaves that is a change in
[1:21:58] the
[1:21:59] season come
[1:22:01] on but we thought that was in the
[1:22:06] Bible better to put your seed in the
[1:22:08] belly of a than put it on the
[1:22:10] ground that ain't in the Bible but yet
[1:22:14] we swore by
[1:22:16] it there's the
[1:22:23] unbelief
[1:22:27] we'll pick up this afternoon and go a
[1:22:28] little further okay come ahead Brothers
[1:22:30] Let's
[1:22:32] stand what is
[1:22:34] death
[1:22:38] unbelief as long as there's
[1:22:41] unbelief there will be
[1:22:46] death but you know one day death it even
[1:22:48] itself will be
[1:22:53] destroyed
[1:22:55] it's not that we're sick because of
[1:22:57] unbelief we're sick because of the
[1:22:59] original unbelief in the
[1:23:02] garden it may be that God is using that
[1:23:06] to bring us into line
[1:23:11] right but I hope you take this message
[1:23:14] and think about
[1:23:15] it I wanted to go a little different way
[1:23:18] and had it wrote to go that way but
[1:23:19] that's all right I went the way of I
[1:23:22] believe
[1:23:23] it Paul was talking about a
[1:23:29] resurrection and he said when that
[1:23:31] Resurrection
[1:23:32] comes then is brought to P the saying
[1:23:37] death where you sting and Grave where is
[1:23:41] your
[1:23:44] Victory then he goes on down below there
[1:23:46] in what in the next verse or something
[1:23:48] we have all things through Jesus
[1:23:53] Christ you you and I our problem is see
[1:23:55] we know too
[1:23:59] much I didn't say revealed I said no too
[1:24:04] much I wish I had revealed what I
[1:24:08] know that's why I still have
[1:24:11] questions all right why because I don't
[1:24:14] know
[1:24:15] everything but I don't mind telling you

[1:33:02] head to toe so I told her I said you
[1:33:05] better check that urine specimen it
[1:33:07] looks suspect to me before you do that
[1:33:10] that urine specimen looked just like
[1:33:11] iced tea it was only then they had taken
[1:33:14] X-rays and they did blood work but it
[1:33:16] was only then that they did the CT scan
[1:33:19] which dis discovered the broken chest
[1:33:21] wall other than that they were getting
[1:33:23] ready to release him to go home the Lord
[1:33:26] all up in there um when I got to the
[1:33:28] scene of the accident the cop said ma'am
[1:33:30] calm down they all had their seat belts

[1:33:49] able to walk around Kendrick didn't
[1:33:51] understand why he was screaming but he
[1:33:53] un buckled his seat Bel and he fell out
[1:33:55] of the car he was on the ground and Zach
[1:33:57] went over to him Bible under this arm
[1:34:00] hand on Kendrick and praying just the
[1:34:03] Lord all up in there um Kendrick had to
[1:34:05] stay for a couple of days at Grady just

[1:34:10] in trauma and burn but God help us with
[1:34:14] Administration we have to go back down
[1:34:16] there to get Ruckers and ID who can go
[1:34:18] down there with a broken chest wall but
[1:34:20] anyway continue to pray for us it's a
[1:34:22] long road um there's no quick fix
[1:34:25] there's no medication for it except pain
[1:34:27] no brace no surgery and just to get up
[1:34:31] and out and down is just a hard thing
[1:34:33] the first morning I didn't I didn't
[1:34:35] realize he had to actually swing his
[1:34:37] legs up over his head to cause momentum
[1:34:39] to get out of the bed we have a bar now
[1:34:42] but just continue to remember us it's
[1:34:43] going to be a long road Kroger doesn't
[1:34:45] offer light
[1:34:46] work so that's what they're saying light
[1:34:49] work so he's going to be out of work for
[1:34:50] a while while that bone heals so just
[1:34:52] continue to remember
[1:34:54] make sure we make sure we we'll be much
