========================================

in this world they ReSound with God's Own Heart oh let the word of [Music] God word of God ever true changing me changing you we have come with open heart oh let the word of god let's sing that one more time word of God ever true changing me and changing you we have come with Open Hearts oh let the word of [Music] God praise the Lord Jesus what a wonderful thing it is to know that we have a word that that we not just read like a newspaper but we can receive life from it amen that can change us while we are reading it amen and it's not just a comic book it's not just a a newspaper or magazine amen or or a Blog article but it's a it's a lifegiving book amen what a wonderful thing it is to know that we have a word that like that and there is no other book like it many sold books you know in the world but there's only one book that can actually change that has actually changed people's lives that's actually transformed their soul amen because there's many books that have changed people's life you know you know some people have gotten wealthy through a book when they applied principles you know some people probably became better mechanics through a book or whatever better fishermen but no book has ever transformed a soul like this book and so that's the reason why we just appreciate the word of God and reverence it in such a way amen you love the Lord amen amen we just appreciate God and appreciate you coming out let's just uh let's just go ahead and have a word of prayer and then we'll go ahead and read the scriptures Lord Jesus we thank you Father for the opportunity that you have given us to come and worship you in spirit and in truth Lord and we appreciate Heavenly Father the the ones that were able to come out Lord God I pray this evening Lord for those that were not able to come out that you would bless them and that you would be with them and meet and Supply every need there according to your riches and glory Lord have your way here amongst us father God lord speak to our hearts Lord might be a little simple thought this evening but father God may you take the Simplicity from it and change father God lord our our the way we see father God our in in in our walk in this in this in this way Lord Jesus Grant it father God we just Commit This Time into your hands and we pray Lord that you just use this vessel Heavenly Father May the words that are being spoken Lord God may be of benefit to your people and you be the the the speaker here this evening father we commit ourselves now un you in Jesus Christ's name amen amen praise the Lord amen well let's go to um Matthew chapter 13 this evening amen I just want to take a little simple thought this evening and just speak about deeply rooted in Christ amen deeply rooted in Christ in Matthew Chapter 13 Verse three and it says and he spake many things unto them in Parables saying Behold a swer went forth to sow and when he sowed some seeds fell by their way Wayside and the fowls came and devoured them up some fell upon Stony places where they had not much Earth and forwith they sprung up because they had no deepness of Earth and when the sun was up they were scorched and because they had no root they withered away all right now let's go to verse verse 20 of the same chapter it says but he that received the seed in into Stony places the same as he that heareth the word and the none with joy receiveth it yet hath he not root in himself but dth for a while for when tribulation or persecution ariseth because of the word by and by He Is offended amen praise the Lord you may have your seats this evening praise God amen amen uh I just we we've been mentioning here uh in the last several Services uh a lot regarding uh uh you know us being the branches and we and him being the the vine and uh and I'm speaking a little slow so that way brother Manuel can can keep up he's back there interpreting because I understand [Laughter] him so um but um how important it is to to know amen that you are not just amen part of of the tree of life amen but that you are connected to the tree of life amen and you were connected by a new birth amen praise the Lord Jesus now I was um I was in my uh I was visiting my parents last weekend and um my dad and me we went for a walk it's a rare rare thing we we do he walks all the time he's 75 years old almost and he just thank God the Lord's really kept him he he he moves and and just handles himself like a 45y old but uh and then that's just the grace of God he all he just gives the thanks to the Lord for that but he walks every day just about and um but he and me we got we got to walk in and behind this house their house there's a there's some trails and uh and I had not been there probably in about a year this was the last time I was walking back there and as I was walking through those Trails which I have walked through before I was noticing that there was a lot of down trees and it was because of the last two storms that came through you know they were really strong you know the hurricane back in September and then they also had a very strong storm just right before that hurricane came through and uh there were some huge huge trees that I I had been there before never thought that those trees would go down and they were tumbled over they were tumbled over and um you know and I and I thought Within Myself you know uh you know sometimes we think you know that things may not happen and and then they they happen and they happen because you see you're not in control of all things things amen praise God but he's ultimately the one who has to say so in all things amen praise the Lord so and I was just thinking you know that these trees why are they down well I mean they were just as thick as all as some of the other trees that were still up uh they seemed like they had full my dad says yeah that one tree over there it had I it was it was beautiful it it it grow leaves beautifully and everything it seemed like he didn't think it would ever go down but it went down it was all and it was it's withering now you know because it's been several months now so I was just thinking you know those trees just could not withstand the element the elements around them were too strong for the foundation that they had you see and so it depends on the foundation that you have amen whether you're going to withstand the elements around you or not amen because let me tell you the bigger they are the harder they fall the bigger you might think somebody is in in in spiritually oh that Pastor just could never leave the message The Harder They Fall you see and that's just how it is amen and and and and it's because these trees did not have Deep Roots amen how come the other ones didn't fall I would they they were experiencing the same winds the same storm the same rain yet they still stayed up oh they might have been shaking a little bit here and there maybe some bark fell off maybe some some some some leaves fell off maybe a couple of branches came down but the tree within itself stayed up amen amen and then and and and so I want you to think of in your life amen uh uh what it what is it going to it I the devil's waiting for something to happen amen that'll cause you to just go ahead and just give it all up oh he's waiting he's always accusing you he's always accusing us before the father and saying how you did this how you did that yesterday and look what happened this day amen but I'm so thankful amen that if you're you're connected to that vine amen you're connected to the root and if your roots are grounded and they're deep amen there is nothing that can happen amen that will cause you to fall amen amen praise the Lord Jesus amen and and and and as I was there just walking through and all you could see left was just the memory of what was and and and and the how the root system that it did have it was it was you know tumbled over you know and um and it all you all you see is the memory there amen of something that that was great and it probably could have lasted a long a long time right but it didn't and so you're looking at you're looking at life and you're looking at Christian lives and and you think my that could that could have been something great he could have helped she could have helped a lot of people amen amen that testimony amen was just spotless until something just came through you know brother random preaches that message and says uh until that time I believe is what it was and uh until that time amen and that changed that changed things completely amen praise the Lord l so we we look here in in in this scripture in Matthew Chapter 13 and and Jesus is speaking it's a very familiar scripture to us and uh I'll do my best to not keep you all too long this evening but uh we're looking here at the parable of the SE and and uh Jesus Jesus mentions um in verse six he says and when the sun was up they they were scorched these seeds that that were that fell on Stony places where they had not much Earth and for with they sprung up because they had no deepness of Earth amen so they they they they started they they they started uh growing right what was in them started growing amen but because they had no where and no way to get to down to the soil there was no roots that they could attach into the soil so they could continue growing you see and Jesus says here in verse 6 and when the sun was up they were scorched because they had no root they withered away way notice that the elements on the outside was what destroyed the seed amen and it wasn't anything it was it had what it needed the seed was good because it it it made it was starting to grow but you see it did not take a it did not go into the soil and it allowed for the elements on the outside which was the sun to wither it and to make it dry now the sun is actually supposed to help it grow but it needs to be be connected with the soil amen amen and we'll speak about that soil here in just a moment amen and then in verse 21 uh verse 20 he he says but he that receiveth the seed into Stony places the same as he that heareth the word and a none with joy receives it yet hath he not root in himself amen how many people have you have have you known amen that they they're excited and they've received the word with excitement amen we've seen many come through and they got excited about the message and they get excited about the word but there is no root in there to Anchor them to hold them amen when hard times come when difficult times when things are pressing in sickness might come through amen a family member who doesn't want to come to church may be influencing them and then they eventually they just slip away amen but they were excited it seemed like they they got something you can't say that they did not get anything they got something but it wasn't enough to Anchor or Holden Amen in this word praise the Lord amen so here Jesus he's explaining about the the importance amen of being uh rooted in your faith amen praise God because the seeds that fall on these Rocky grounds amen they withered amen because the lack of of of of Deep Roots amen and so we need to have deep roots in our in our spiritual walk amen not just shallow roots amen but deep roots because you can make it through a little storm amen here and there you can make it through some storms amen but the Ultimate Storm will come that God knows amen that it it will come and and storms will come Temptations will come amen trials and tribulations will come amen and you must be you must be rooted deep Amen in order for you to stand Amen in the in this last day that we're living in cuz we're living in such perilous time Saints amen and we see that Jesus here he he also repeats the same uh Parable in Luke chapter8 verse 5 and six now I want you to look at something here real quick he says he if you want to go with me there but it says in Luke 8: 5 and 6 a swer went out to sew his seed and as he sowed some fell by the wayside and it was trotten down and the fowls of the air devoured it and some fell upon a rock and as soon as it was sprung up so we notice that it sprung up it withered away and watch what Jesus says here because it lacked moisture all right so if in one place he says because it withered away because it didn't have root and now here he's saying because it lacked uh moisture it must mean that root and moisture have to do something to to to with each other amen and so a root what it does is it it it takes up it takes up water Amen in order for the for the tree to be able to live so the reason why this seed here amen it Not only was it not taking up water because it didn't have enough roots to grab to the water amen it didn't also of course it didn't that didn't that did not allow for those roots to continue growing you see praise God so so that that's very interesting Saints because water and Roots amen the more you are connected to Christ the more you are feeding on this water of life amen the more those roots are supposed to be expanded amen though in order for you to live amen that's the reason why we say Washed by the Water of the word amen as the word is going forth It's washing you amen it's giving you life amen and it's intertwining and connecting and it should connect you to one another right to good truth trees that have good roots praise God because a good a good trees amen a whole wood of trees or or Forest full of trees they're just they're not just an island to themselves if you see the world under them amen it's a to it's a connected world Amen it's a world Amen that the world out here does not see it looks like they're separated on the outside but on the inside amen there is a full connction ction and I believe in this hour saints that we're going to need one another more than you think that we need one another especially in the time that we're living in Saints you're going to need amen your brother and your sister oh you might not like me but you're going to need me amen praise the Lord Jesus I'm going to need you why because if you are part of Christ and I'm part of Christ we're part of the same Vine amen we're part of the same root system amen praise God and we going to need one another in this hour amen oh my praise the Lord Jesus I believe that even in the days amen when when when when when the martyrs amen during that time amen it was it was during the times amen when when persecution was coming in that they were drawing closer to one another they may have may may not have agreed on some doctrines they may not have agreed on this here in there and maybe personality uh you know kind of clashed with each other amen but when person persecution amen come in and they're all fighting for the same cause amen that should cause you to to draw closer together and those trees amen they are they are knit tight to one another amen and that's the reason that's another reason why they don't fall they they have a good root system they have good nourishment from the water and they're also interconnected with each other amen and just think about that in the spiritual life amen how important that is praise the Lord to be connected to one another because the long the longer we live Saints the more uh Society Society the way it is it it it it it's causing us Amen to just be loners I don't know how how better way to say that and uh you're you're going to need somebody amen at some point praise God Amen first of all you need Christ amen amen and second of all if you you need your brother you need one another praise the Lord Jesus now let's talk about the nature of a seed for just a moment amen now brother brother brandom he he mentioned uh in several times in the message he would talk about the deratization that that that term isn't really in the dictionary but it's it is germinated seed amen germinated seed and that is that is seed that already has life in it all right so uh brother Wade when he's getting ready to plant uh uh his uh corn or and his his his vegetables and things he plants seed that he knows has life in it right or in other words it's been germinated because you can plant a seed that looks just like a regular seed that has been germinated that has life and it looks exactly like it but if it doesn't have a that germ that germanized uh uh uh life in it amen you can put all kinds of fertilizer on top of it you can put the sun you can put a lot of water I mean tons of water on it and nothing will happen nothing will happen amen so this germatize seed or germinated seed what it means is that it has undergone pollination and that it's now an an embryo amen praise the Lord Jesus Oh My amen praise God and I I'm just thinking amen that in God's mind this word amen is deratization amen amen and when you hear this word praise the Lord amen something amen that that strikes that amen and it causes amen a germination of effect to take place in your life amen praise God Amen so uh and so that's the difference between what happens that is a germatize seed and then germination is what occurs when the seed breaks open and begins to grow and that's where that's when you start seeing the little shoot coming through amen praise the Lord now all that in order for it to come through but that means that that that life has already had to have been there amen and from the beginning you see praise the Lord amen and so that life amen was in the mind of God before the foundation of the world Amen praise God you were in him before the foundation of the world but you had to come here to hear the word amen and therefore that word strikes that seed which the seed you're not Eternal the seed is which is the word amen and then it can spring forth you see but there has never been any one that has received a new birth without first hearing the word of God you have to be around or hear the word of God read the word of God in order for there to truly be a a there a new birth amen so how important it the word of God is amen and as I was saying there at the beginning amen the word is the only thing that can produce life in someone's Soul amen amen tell me if The Da Vinci Code can do that amen or or or or any of these secular books that are are out there amen none of them can they can entertain you for a little while and they can make you laugh or make you cry or make you depressed amen but they can never change a soul amen not like this word can amen and I'm so thankful amen and this hour that we have that praise God brother brandham says in the message uh seeking after Jesus in 1953 he says this and this is just not something that some mythical something that somebody has thought up it's the word of God now all man can't receive it all man can't receive it they can hear it but not all men can receive it the Bible said that they'd be blind and they'd just they'd just have to be the Bible said that they were for ordained to this condemnation they just can't believe it they've got nothing in there to believe with so they just like a grain of corn if it isn't gerti here he says that word again ger ized in other words pre-ordained or with the life amen well a good pollinated seed amen it'll never raise up no matter how much fertilizer you put on it it has no life to raise by but if it's got life you can just put in any kind of ground and it'll come forth amen amen praise God now we'll talk about that here in just a moment when we get to uh here in just a moment I'm going to speak about predestination for just a moment amen so uh so just as a plant thrives in fertile soil amen Faith also thrives in a spiritually prepared heart amen praise God faith amen is Faith cometh by hearing and hearing of the word of God so faith and hearing amen go go hand in hand praise the Lord and in order for that seed Amen to come amen into fruition or be or or or start germinating or start producing life you have to have faith in the word amen you have to have faith that what God Said Amen is for you praise the Lord Jesus you have to have faith amen that if the word says amen uh by your stripes he by your by his stripes you are healed amen you take that word for you amen and you are healed oh I don't feel anything amen but just take it by faith because the the word is already it's already gerz amen it's got life in it praise God and all it needs is to be embedded in the ground of Faith amen your faith and watch that and watch that word come to uh come to pass praise the Lord amen so the word the word can only take root in a faith prepared heart amen so we we know that Faith amen has to be there in order for the word to live in your life amen because let me just make it this way you're not going to follow anything that you don't believe right you're not going to uh follow uh or go after uh with your whole heart anything that that that really is not of importance to you amen so because you believe the word amen then the word can do something for you amen praise God now this seed amen it has to be planted in You by natural means now when I say natural means I mean like Romans 10:17 says faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of God Amen and as I said earlier amen no one has ever received a new birth experience without the word there being first amen because the word is the only one that can give a new birth amen because it is life amen it is and and and and and he is life and the word is Christ amen and so it's all the same thing praise the Lord so um so speaking about uh with predestined let's talk about that here for just a moment amen you look at the woman at the well amen praise God she had to hear the word at some point amen and when the word come to the word then it it it sprung to life amen praise God you see so it has to be amen that that that word has to already be gerti Amen in God's mind Amen brother brandham called it amen uh uh PR uh what is it the predestined ation of uh representation of predestination Amen in other words there had to be a representation already in God's mind in order for something to already to spring up amen praise God uh so if you were that's why the Pharisees they could not amen receive or accept that word amen because it wasn't in God's mind they had the opportunity just like the woman at the well but the representation wasn't there Amen in order for that to come to actually come to pass now if you think about representation a representation is like an image right right and image is just uh the picture of what really is right let's take brother Brandon would use for example uh you can't get warmed by a painted fire all right I could put here on these screens Brother Anderson could put here um pictures or a a video of a nice warm uh uh fire right in inside of inside of inside a uh a fireplace and you might be here cold maybe the the heat isn't working in here and uh right now we don't need the heat but what I'm saying maybe it's very cold in here sometimes I know I know some the ones that come and open the the the the church house and if it's cold outside it's very cold in here as well brother Terence I'm sure you you probably know that but but and you know if you put on a screen on the screen a a fireplace just Flames coming up very nice I mean there can even be stockings there and and it's just very nice and and you can even hear the crackling and and everything and you get up close to the screen well I'm not I'm not feeling anything you'll put your back in it why because it's a painted fire it's only a representation of what can be amen you see what I'm saying because it's not the real thing that's why when we say when Jesus when Jesus said that the lamb was slain before the foundation of the world but yet it needed to come here on Earth to actually come to pass because that was a representation of when Jesus really came and died for us on the cross of Calvary you see so that when they say that woman had representation it was because in God's mind he knew that down through time amen when Jesus was going to come and he was going to thirst there at the well and he told the disciples I must needs go about Samaria amen and then the woman was coming through with the water pot and and and maybe she was holding it here under her head and and and and then she's coming in and she sees that man sitting there and and and and he asks her give me a drink God is seeing this representation all this time amen and he could predestinate because he saw amen that she would amen want that word amen praise God therefore she had representation because the image right representation is the image or the or the thought amen because when you think things it's just a representation but it's not the reality yet amen but when you speak it or you go do it then that representation comes to life you see what I'm saying that might be a little a little hard to to to but I hope you understand amen for the kides here so it's very important amen that that that um so that woman amen she had representation but those Pharisees did not have representation because the same word came to them they heard the same word but yet they could not connect with it why cuz there was no representation amen they could not receive there was no gerti amen seed there or representing them you see praise God they had the same opportunity though and that's what I want you to realize amen that this world out here has the same opportunity that you and I have amen but yet you accept it amen aren't you thankful for that amen you received the word when it came to me you know I remember when uh I'm I'm you know I've told my testimony kind of it's been broken but I remember when when when this when when the brother there in Colombia South America he he was telling us about this message and and telling and and we had already been through several churches the Baptist Church we were at the Baptist Church during that time and and the brother said you know he he was telling us about a prophet you know that come in this day and uh and so my mom quickly because my mom was there in the room and and my dad was there and I was there and my mom quickly tells him and says uh but you know the Bible says that in the last day there' be false prophets now we're coming at it from a Baptist perspective right because a Baptist don't believe in prophets in this day doesn't believe in miracles doesn't believe in none of those things uh at least the fundamental Baptist that we came out of and so and so I remember the brother he says you know but but you know if there are false prophets amen then there must be true prophets in order for false prophets to come out of come out of oh that silenced us yes right and when he said that just something struck me right there amen and God just started working with me right there and then and because that that sounded that sounded so that that was like to me that was like woman give me a drink right yeah exactly there was something different that resonated different than what the pastor at the Baptist Church was preaching to me amen because it was truth amen and truth always sets you free amen amen it never confuses you more it never leaves you amen uh depressed or sad amen truth amen sets you free and he whom the sun set free and the Sun is truth is free indeed I'm so thankful for that the Lord Jesus amen amen so you have to know amen that that you you have to know amen that you're not just placed amen you're not just placed but rooted in Christ amen right praise God you're not just you're not just leaning on him amen but you are rooted in him amen is him in you and and and and I in him and him and you praise the Lord Jesus and so that's the reason why it's so important amen for us to be planted near near water amen amen wherever there's water and we know that water represents the word amen and the and the and the closer you are to the word amen the deeper amen the the the more green the more you can Thrive praise the Lord amen amen the further away you are from the word the more dry you'll get the more uh the more uh uh you know problems that you will have right if there's no tree that there's no plants no trees they get water amen then they they're going to have problems oh the sun will take care of it well Jesus said that the sun scorched that seed amen so it's not just enough the sun is not just enough and we know that Jesus represents the Sun as well amen praise God but you need both amen you need the Sun and you need water amen just like it just like in the fivefold ministry praise the Lord Jesus just like you are perfected amen by a fful Ministry you need the word right amen and the fful ministry is preaching the word amen so you need both praise the Lord but it's not just it's not the fful ministry that perfects you it's the Holy Ghost through that fful Ministry that perfects you and I I just want to make that clear amen because sometimes amen we could just say well you need the fful ministry and without me you can't get it amen you can't get it without the Holy Ghost that's why you can't get it amen you need the Holy Ghost to get it amen and the Holy Ghost preaching through the FF Ministry that's what gets it to you amen praise God that's what gets you perfected amen I can't perfect you I don't know what your problems are brother Wade can't perfect you amen the Holy Ghost has known you before the foundation of the world Amen he can perfect you amen praise God hallelujah and he does a great good Perfection amen I'm thankful for the Perfection that he does CU I can't my perfection is there no perfection in it amen praise the Lord amen I I I I I make a mess out of things amen I tell tell I tell people you know sometimes you know uh the other day we were at at a board meeting there at at Hall County and some some some technical things happened and I was up there trying to fix some things and uh and they said and they said something about a technician I said well yeah you know if we we computer guys if we can't fix it we just break it it's either we fix it or we break it more because there were trying to tr Tinker with it and mess with it and things like that and because you know we want to we want to see it's software wise as well and when they're tinkering with it so much amen if we're not fixing anything we just break it more amen might as well learn from it that you know praise God so I can't fix your your I can't do anything about your Perfection amen but Christ can Hallelujah but you got to stay amen uh uh connected to that Living Water amen and when we stay close to him amen we we don't need any artificial sources amen you don't need anything amen artificial to be placed amen around your life or or anything that that that seems like amen life amen you just need life amen that so that you can grow amen into him praise God now I want just want to talk for a moment about John the Baptist and I have some scriptures here you can read them in John chap 1: 22- 23 and uh in Matthew 11 11: 2-1 but in in John chap 1 uh when they came to to John the Baptist and they said who are you and he said I'm one the one crying in the wilderness make straight the way of the Lord as said the prophet Isaiah he knew where he was standing amen he knew what his calling was he knew where he was and and he connected himself in the word amen and that's why it's so important in this hour amen that you connect yourself back to the word amen that that you know amen what scpt scripture speaks to you where you are at in this word so that you can fulfill that word amen praise the Lord and so John the Baptist did that and when the Pharisees came and then when Jesus came he said amen Behold the Lamb of God who taketh away the sins of the world Amen he knew that it was him amen at that moment he was anointed amen and he knew exactly amen that that was the Lamb of God praise the Lord but then maybe several months later passed and and in Matthew 11: 2 amen uh it says now when John had heard in the prison The Works of Christ he sent two of his disciples and said unto him art thou he that should come or do we look for another so John now he's he's he's doubting or he's asking if if if what he said that here comes the Lamb of God Amen who takes away the sin of the world that is him amen now he's wondering is it really him because now he's in a prison now he's in a state of of where he's not you know he can't be influential anymore right he can't he can't maybe he's not receiving the feedback like he was be with outside of prison so probably he his mind is going into a depressed state oh my those are dangerous times Saints amen because it's in those depressed States amen where you start doubting what you once thought was reality was the truth amen and if you're not careful and if you're not grounded if you're not rooted amen isn't those times amen those are critical critical times and so he John introduced the the the Messiah and later and later he he struggled but then Jesus keeps uh in that same in that same scripture amen he he he starts he starts telling the disciples to go tell John that the lame walk the blind see the de hear and all these different things and then even though John was doubting him he starts praising John oh my I'm just wondering amen that even in our doubts amen God still for us amen when you are doubting amen praise God now doubting sometime I know we say doubting sometimes is a bad thing and and it is you we should should not doubt his word but doubting now listen to this real carefully doubting amen could help us actually ground ourselves more in the word because it makes you look further to see all right if if if you just see if we if you just take things for for for face value and and just take oh well because my pastor said it and and you know brother so and so preaches and that's it you know then I accept it but you don't know it for yourself that's a problem see you you believe the right thing but that doesn't mean that your roots are are are are are long and and and and healthy and and something comes across your life and boom you're down like those trees in the back of my mom and dad's house so it doesn't mean that you just you're you you know the truth amen you've been in the message church for 50 years and then you know oh my my roots they're grounded no let's give you the word test and the word test amen comes in by by experiences amen surprises amen situations things come in amen are will you stand for that word or will you just go ahead and just cleave on to the to to whatever situation you fall amen and you just give in give way to that so it's very important amen that we we be we be grounded and rooted amen Amen in the word that we live in amen and that we not just say Amen that I I believe this message amen but we know what this message is about we know what it's about amen so G so so doubts and questions uh those are healthy things really if you look at them because if God has really done a work in your heart amen you're going to go and look further in the word there's an answer to this because brother brandham said if there is a Bible question then there's a Bible answer if there's a question about anything right because listen Thomas even doubted and Jesus had so much mercy and so much grace he said I'm going to Thomas per I'm going in that room personally to minister to Thomas everybody in there all the disciples in there and he personally had Thomas look at my hands amen so he cares amen he he he knows and he knows what our struggles are and he knows what we're thinking our questions are so it's good now and then that's why we have questions and answers amen praise the lord it's good to have questions it's good to have doubts but not let the doubt amen hinder your walk with Christ let the doubt amen give you clo get you closer to the word because the doubt raises questions and the questions amen will will well it'll take a true Christian back to the word looking through the message amen and that's that and that's what studying is that's what studying is you know many there's many times many things that I learned amen that that by questions that I had and when you have questions amen then it makes you go into the word get in the word further and then you're there forever and you and you probably get more than what you were what you were asking for amen praise God Amen so uh so then Jesus he says here he says verily I say unto you among them that are born of women there hath not risen a greater than John the Baptist amen and then he says notwithstanding he that is the least he that is least in the Kingdom of Heaven is greater than he amen he's speaking about you and me amen he's speaking about you amen who are the least amen of the Kingdom of Heaven why because John the Baptist could not experience the new birth like you and me can amen this hour praise God and so you're greater than even John the Baptist amen even though Jesus amen gave him all the flowers amen while living amen your life with the Holy Ghost is greater than even John the Baptist praise the Lord Jesus amen only because of the holy of the indwelling of the Holy Ghost and the new birth amen praise the Lord all right let I'm me skip a couple of things here all right so that word amen it must take root in US amen the word made flesh it cames to it came to John so how does it come to us amen how does the word come to us amen praise God we don't have to just have the word come to us but thank God we can have the word in US amen and that's that's that's the that's the most important thing amen praise God Amen John John he could see the word coming to him in flesh but Jesus said in John 20:29 blessed are those that have not seen but yet believed amen praise God we can experience God more deeply than John did because we have the fullness of his spirit amen praise the Lord amen I'm so thankful amen that in this hour it's counted unto us amen a a a blessing a faith amen that you were not there you didn't experience certain things amen but yet you believed amen and you and you said Amen to the word praise God John saw the word coming to him he even touched it he he baptized the word amen he baptized Jesus amen he experienced it amen praise God but you are greater amen because the word now lives in you amen and you can live it amen and you're not just baptizing but you go get baptized amen and you actually live out this word amen praise the Lord I'm so thankful for that Amen brother brandom says here was John on Earth making the written word live live he was the voice of one crying in the wilderness and he always also was preparing the way before the Messiah and Jesus said you love to walk in his light because he was that light bright and Shining Light amen praise God now let's talk about Roots here for just a moment and I'm and and I appreciate your patience amen and uh we just thank you for for listening to that tonight so what is a root amen and and who is the root and The Offspring of David amen now now here's where just listen to this here real quick what is the root and the basic functions of roots roots are the principal organ for the absorption of water and dissolved nutrients in most seed plants and Fern and in ferns the root also anchors the plant body and can store reserved Foods all right so all this happens is not just drinking all at once but it also stores nutrients and water inside the roots Roots usually grow beneath the surface of the soil and extend from the base of the stem some Roots however grow above the ground from branches or leaves these roots either penetrate the soil or become attached to another plant or object as they grow now now I I I I thought this was interesting here the single root that develops from the seed so when that when that seed seeds ger germinate is germinated or germinates right that little comes out there's a little root that comes out right it might be a little flimsy amen but it's a root you got to start somewhere amen it might be flimsy but you have to start somewhere amen don't don't underestimate amen your walk with Christ amen young people when you start oh I might not have the F the faith of of the pastor I might not have the faith of my dad or I might not have the faith amen but you started that means you got a little root amen amen and so it's got to be taken care of right this single root that develops from the seed or from the base of a stem in the case of ferns is called the primary root amen and that's why that's why I said that you know that's why the Bible calls Jesus amen that he is the root and The Offspring of David amen so that primary root amen that's Christ amen or that types Christ amen praise God that's that's what that's what causes amen that growth in in your life amen praise God and it's because you are you are drinking from the fountain amen praise the Lord Jesus and in another place Jesus is called the root uh an offspring of David amen praise the Lord Jesus so it's very important to start somewhere amen you you you you you you don't know where to start amen start reading your word the Bible amen start listen listening to good things amen praise God that'll help that that'll help start amen that that germination in your in in in in that that word amen comes to fruition and it'll start building those little Roots amen and the The Roots just didn't amen it wasn't hundreds and thousands of roots that just came from that little seed why because that will just kill that seed if that's what happened amen but it's got to start little amen and it's got to start tender oh I know this sounds simple and and it might be boring to you but amen Jesus used it as an example so amen we so we need it praise God Amen but that's the reason why Saints amen that people wither away amen it's because they start amen they start and and and and and they might have this little root coming in amen but they don't take care of it praise God and they allow other things in this life amen uh uh to just just choke them praise the Lord amen and so this is the hour a that people they're falling away amen amen but I'm so glad I'm looking at people that haven't fallen away amen praise the Lord Jesus somebody's got to fulfill amen scriptures amen praise God so the seeds that lack Deep Roots amen they always wither away and and that's usually it's symbolic of weak Faith amen you have to be you have to have faith faith that what God started he will perfect it amen praise the Lord Jesus I know many of us we've served God for a long time and and and uh but there's some there's some that you know they're just starting out amen praise the Lord and uh and they need amen they need a little you know a little come on you can do it you can do it amen we' we we've conquered we've made it through amen I know you can amen cuz you had to start this exact same way praise the Lord a little root a little primary roote amen that you took care of and God did the rest of the growth praise the Lord now I want to talk about the soil here for just a moment amen and and I see uh like the soil is almost like it's like the life of the believer amen praise God because because if you look at the soil Saints the soil doesn't look attractive it does it looks dirt it's dirty it's dirt it it might be black it might be uh Brown and and and and and it gets really uh it gets on your shoes and and it and it stains your Nikes and and it just you have to clean it up you know but that that is what is needed in order for there to be growth because in in the light in the soil and that's why I say it's the light it's like the life of the believer amen there's NE nutrients in it there's there's minerals in there there are things that the roots are taken in in order for it to their for for there to be growing amen praise the Lord so life the Christian Life Saints it's it's not always uh a flowery bed of ease and it's not always easy amen but it it's dark and murky sometimes actually probably most of the time amen but but but the sun amen also hits the soil just like it hits the plant you see and so the soil also enjoys the sunlight and it also enjoys the rain and it also amen so good times and bad times come upon not just the plant but also the soil this life is this way amen I'm not saying that the Christian's life is always a depressing thing and all and it shouldn't be amen God restore us our joy if we're if we're losing our joy amen restore to me the joy of thy salvation Lord and renew a right Spirit Within Me amen and I believe that's what a a Christian always wants amen because whenever you're looking for something else out there amen some entertainment some some something amen some Facebook or or some Instagram uh feeds or or or or YouTube videos or constant amen that's because you're lacking the joy of the Lord in your life amen the joy of the Lord in your life is not able to keep you so therefore you have to go and Main and get temporary joy in order for for that to and you think that that's good and you think that that's that that satisfies but the reason why you're back again Doom scrolling is because you weren't satisfied in the first place amen so that's why we need to have the joy of the Lord amen so this Christian life it doesn't look it doesn't look uh uh attractive amen but it's in this life amen in this soil uh that that we need that soil Amen in order to keep to keep the growth Amen in that soil we encounter many trials but trials makes us stronger amen praise the Lord Jesus now I was reading a a story uh about a man his name was Parnell Bailey and um he he visited an Orange Grove one time where an irrigation pump had failed and and in that season the season was very dry and it was it was uh very it was unusual usually dry and some of those orange trees they were dying because because they were lacking water amen so that tour guide that was there touring Parnell Bailey he he took him he he showed him those trees and he saw how they were dying but then he took them over to another Grove and it was his personal Grove and he says now look at look look at these trees and he explained that his trees they could probably survive another two weeks with Without Rain and so the parel belly asks well what's the difference between these trees and and and these trees and so he tells them that he intentionally withheld water from them in order to encourage them to stretch out their roots in order to seek more water and that that's the reason why he he he would not allow them to have water constantly so that they could go out seeking for more amen that so that they could do it on their own oh my praise the Lord amen that's the reason why it can't be a flowy bed of ease all the time for you that's why things can't always be easy for us Saints amen because you've got to sometimes doubts come sometimes questions come amen but that's what gets you Amen to look into the word further amen that's what gets you Amen to look into the water amen that can give you life amen that can sustain you then praise the Lord amen just like these orange trees amen uh uh they they he he the master or the master planter intentionally did that oh my you might say well why is God allowing this in our life this just completely uh uh this this this hurts you bad amen whatever it is financially spiritually or whatever it may be amen but God knows amen that that's going to cause you to get on your knees Amen to seek for him amen praise God and he knows that you're going to do that therefore he allows it in your life amen praise the Lord and and therefore his trees amen they develop the deepest roots in that area and so all those other trees amen they were dying in that drought and they were amen his trees were still thriving why because they had really deep deep roots amen praise the Lord amen How Deep Is Your Walk In Christ amen praise God mistakes and troubles amen they may come amen the elements out out here amen they may be making the bark fall off your tree things amen may be coming off amen but praise God those roots are still grounded and rooted in Christ amen praise the Lord you might make mistakes young people amen you might fall praise the Lord Jesus amen but if you're rooted in Christ amen you don't have to worry your life is safe in Christ amen praise the Lord Brother Bram says that Faith's resting place is in the word of God Amen so the importance of being active Amen in the word is so so important in the hour that we're living in Amen in every hour praise the Lord it was very important in sister C in your time to be active and and faithful in the word and if it was in her time that still amen it's even more in our time amen because we are living in such a deceiving age brother brandham says Amen in in the message the Third Exodus Faith looks at the word but Faith places itself upon the unmovable Rock God's Eternal word amen Faith don't look at reason amen I don't care how much you can show it it would be better if the word says no faith rests there that is the sanctuary of Faith's resting place I like that amen that is the sanctuary of Faith's resting place amen amen so I'm so thankful for that but you know if he is the the root and offspring of David if he is the vine and we are the branches I'm so glad that he took it for us before we even came through with it amen I like what he says there we'll we'll finish with this in John chapter 16 verse 32 he says behold the hour cometh yay is now come that ye shall be scattered every man to his own and shall leave me alone and yet I am not alone because the father is with me in verse 33 he says these things I have spoken unto you that in me in me he doesn't say on me the disciples were leaning on him that didn't give him the new birth though amen but in me ye might have peace Amen in the world ye shall have tribulation he he didn't say you might have amen but you shall have tribulation but then he says but be of good cheer amen because I have overcome the world Amen if he could withstand it he withstood it amen the root and offspring of David amen he withstood it he did it for you and me amen if we're connected in him praise God then that that means we can do it as well amen how many believe that amen because he has overcome the world and I'm an overcomer with him amen and there's nothing amen that you and I need to worry about oh sure we're going to get hit amen we're going to get hit I mean so sometimes we're going to get amen knocks amen financially sometimes we're going to get hit amen knocks Amen on your health amen expected things praise God but you know they uh they say that you know you you should have a uh uh an emergency fund amen for unexpected things for when you know uh Murphy starts you know rubbing on on on that engine in your car he just constant banging on it you know all right it's just uh you know and sometimes he might go and start rubbing on that air unit you know in your house you know and then starts making weird noises and then all of a sudden amen as June 21st hits It's Gone amen but you see Saints amen uh Murphy is going to be there all the time amen amen but if if you have placed amen your faith in that emergency fund amen in Christ emergency fund amen praise God then he can he can answer back amen with something he's gone through it already and he knows exactly what you need at the moment that you need it amen praise the Lord Jesus I'm so thankful for that amen how many love the Lord tonight so let's let's let's think about our growth in Christ amen is it deep rooted or is it shallow rooted amen do do H how deep am I in this word amen I'm when I say that I'm not saying amen you've got to go look for the Hebrew and the Greek of every word amen as you're reading the the Bible you've got to you know do this that let no I mean that's good that's that's good but but amen has that life the life of the word is it speaking to you because the life of the word is what we want amen when you get that word and you say oh my I am convinced and concerned and then I go out and live it amen I put it to practice that is what's grow making those roots grow out bigger amen man the roots are moving roots are moving amen they're not just taking in and then just staying still but when they're taking in they're getting longer and they're doing something amen they're moving and that's that's what a Christian does Amen it moves amen when it gets the word it moves Amen on the basis of that word that it received amen praise the Lord so we must do that in this hour amen let's stand to our feet praise the Lord let's have the musicians come let's have a word of prayer Lord Jesus we thank you Heavenly Father for the opportunity that you have given us to hear your word tonight Lord and I just appreciate Lord God Almighty the the attention Lord from the people of God here Lord and we just I pray Lord that something was said Lord that it would help them that would give them Lord God uh a little bit more understanding of this Christian walk Lord Jesus might just a little simple thought but Lord father God you can take the simple things and make them real in our lives Lord Jesus Lord I pray that you'd bless those that are sick amongst us father God there so many father that are still sick and and lord they're they're not here with us and I just ask that you'd be with them Lord and that you would just bless them Lord wherever they may be at this moment father God we just commit the rest of this time into your hands we thank you Lord and we ask these things now father God in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen rooted in Christ Jesus praise God you know as brother Aaron there's preparing you know when you're when you're thinking about a family tree you know and uh I was starting to do a family tree back in uh a couple of years ago I started getting into family tree and cuz I was looking at brother Joe Canada's family tree and oh my it's just likeo it's justo it's long and it's it's very it's very detailed and I said you know what I want to do the same thing I started looking into uh you know my family and and I found out that because you know my family doesn't live didn't live here in the states so there's not too many [Laughter] records and so I could only get so far I can only get to probably about my um uh one of my parents uh I think my mom's side uh her her grandmother and that's about it and then I was looking at brother Joe's and I was looking at mine I was like man mine's mine's is poor it's like I it's like I just don't have I don't have a family I just I don't know where where I came from but but you know even even though it might be it amen praise God but that word amen struck my heart one day and I said yes to the word amen and I know that that takes me back amen way back amen into back parts of the minds of God Amen and so brother Joe's amen uh family tree amen it it probably has a stopping point at some point but his spiritual family tree amen keeps going and going and going it's Eternal amen praise God oh my praise the Lord Jesus so amen let's just be rooted in Christ amen because when you're rooted in Christ it's rooted throughout all eternity amen praise the Lord sing some brother his love and favor I shall not be moved just like a tree that's planted by the water I shall not be mov I shall not be I shall not be moved I shall not be I shall not be moved just like a
