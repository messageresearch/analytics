[49:49] [Music]
[49:50] we were trying to think the other day
[49:52] and
[49:53] I think 1978 was the last time I was in
[49:55] this building
[49:56] I was a young scrapping boy
[49:59] getting ready to go to college and
[50:02] and no I didn't go to Mars Hill some of
[50:04] you thought I did but he did get his
[50:05] scholarship from there but I didn't know
[50:07] all right I went to a college around
[50:09] town and played baseball and not
[50:11] football but uh if I went to Mars Hill
[50:15] I've been up here a lot more because I
[50:16] love this place this is good I love it
[50:19] up here I I enjoy the people and I'm
[50:22] sorry it's been this long since we have
[50:24] not felt sick with each other
[50:30] I promise
[50:33] but I appreciate uh brother Andre
[50:35] opening up his pulpit and opening it up
[50:39] his time and look for the effort all of

[51:00] good Fellowship but we sure enjoyed it

[51:04] yeah probably about half is here and a
[51:06] half at home for the bottoms with them
[51:08] now but thank you for coming and putting
[51:10] forth in effort it takes an effort to
[51:12] come up and and take two or three days
[51:15] out of your time and and commitments and
[51:18] commit to to coming up here and
[51:21] fellowshipping I know some of you
[51:24] do know the background that we used to
[51:26] come up here a lot when we were younger
[51:27] and we all looked a lot younger and
[51:30] acted a lot younger but now we're older
[51:33] the Bible says
[51:35] now we're older we've come to a time
[51:37] where we got older many have passed many
[51:40] have left many are on the other side
[51:42] waiting on us man that's right wait on
[51:46] us to what come to Perfection yes
[51:48] because there will be a group I believe
[51:50] in the end time that will stand and look
[51:52] at death
[51:54] and as you were saying last night
[52:00] you have no hold on me because we've
[52:04] come to a place where God is going to
[52:06] indwell us so much it will be the living
[52:10] breathing moving instrumentality of God
[52:13] so the prophet tells us amen and we sure
[52:16] do know that by Foreign always God you
[52:18] would be here today and everybody would
[52:20] be here and everybody brother Joel good
[52:22] to have you with us today and he did a
[52:24] wonderful job last night

[52:33] each other about sermons we really don't
[52:35] but we're going to talk about babies a
[52:37] little bit today
[52:38] so if you were there last night you'll
[52:41] get part of it and then you'll get the
[52:42] rest of it today but it doesn't but we
[52:44] sure do appreciate both y'all coming in
[52:46] yeah that's right and we've always
[52:48] enjoyed being around him and we sure do
[52:50] appreciate it so if you got your Bible
[52:52] let's turn to the Book of Luke I do want
[52:55] to say before we get started uh from all
[52:57] of us at spoken word church and my dad
[52:59] uh back to where you know Tangled by the
[53:03] same Bell y'all know him you know him
[53:05] for years and years and years I want to
[53:07] read you a scripture that come to my
[53:08] heart just a few minutes ago and as bro
[53:11] Louise said we you know there's history
[53:13] between the two churches from a long
[53:14] time ago and we kind of drifted off
[53:17] apart from each other and the brother
[53:19] Jackson said it was time for us to get
[53:20] all back together we got it all back
[53:22] together now he said even he's been
[53:24] wanting for a long time so I hope that
[53:25] was your desire that we just don't hate
[53:27] each other so much we don't want to live
[53:28] with each other for an eternity hello
[53:30] don't start doing tomato we're good
[53:32] Ephesian food verse 14 says for he is
[53:35] our peace now that's not what I'm going
[53:37] to read but this is what we've come to
[53:39] thought just a few minutes ago he is our
[53:41] peace who hath made both one
[53:44] and have broken down
[53:47] the middle wall of petition
[53:51] the plaintiff
[53:53] I believe that it has been dissolved
[53:55] done away with don't need it no more we
[53:58] need God right we need God to to when we
[54:02] when we think about we don't want to
[54:04] think about how we can hurt somebody we
[54:06] want to think about how we can help
[54:07] somebody yes amen

[55:53] down but it would be for the rich Wilson
[55:54] different ones that lay the foundation
[55:56] that we stand on today yes we don't
[55:59] stand on a foundation that's that that's
[56:01] that's out there that's changed
[56:03] doctrines that's moved to this and
[56:04] forgot that and I was telling me at
[56:06] church the other day you know we've
[56:08] we've had just two pastors at Spoken
[56:10] Word Church whether Ernest Moten and Dad
[56:12] and uh that's been for 52 years we're
[56:15] celebrating our anniversary just a
[56:17] couple weeks ago July 4th and we sure
[56:20] appreciate God letting us have some
[56:22] stability
[56:23] stability even in your human life is
[56:27] what we want if you don't want turmoil
[56:29] you don't want stability yeah so now in
[56:31] the word of God we have received
[56:33] stability and we are we are resting on
[56:35] that and I'm resting on that we're going
[56:37] to take this to the coming of the Lord
[56:39] amen we're going to see that and I do it
[56:42] I'm just dumb enough to believe I'm
[56:44] going to be one of them amen you push me
[56:47] out but okay I'll bring you with me so
[56:50] we're going to speak on anointed for a
[56:51] purpose
[56:53] listen to this in Luke 4 verse 17. and
[56:56] that was delivered unto him the book of
[56:58] the prophet Isaiah now this is Jesus yes
[57:00] coming into the temple we're going to
[57:03] start in from the beginning and go all
[57:05] the way through but this is a this is
[57:07] the kind of the hinge point of what
[57:09] we're going to talk about because
[57:10] brother Brown calls this the greatest
[57:11] anointing yeah Abram in the face of the
[57:14] Earth amen right here this scripture it
[57:17] wasn't shouting it wasn't speaking in
[57:18] tongues it wasn't running the aisles
[57:24] now listen Jesus is the only one who can
[57:27] open the book
[57:29] right and he's the only one who can
[57:30] close but yes
[57:32] because when we get finished with this
[57:33] he closed the book man and he handed it
[57:36] back now are we living in a closed book
[57:38] page no no we're living because Christ
[57:41] came and he opened the book
[57:43] at the end of time we believe that Luke
[57:45] 4 17. and when he had opened the book
[57:47] they handed him a closed book he took it
[57:49] he opened it he found the place where it
[57:52] was written oh by the way Jesus was in
[57:54] church y'all ought to try that sometimes
[57:56] amen the fearing of the Lord is upon me
[57:58] because he hath anointed me
[58:01] now listen Jesus was almighty God Amen
[58:05] that's right he was the Holy Ghost
[58:08] all right he didn't need the Holy Ghost
[58:10] he was the Holy Ghost amen all right
[58:12] everybody with me
[58:14] but there's an anointing that comes
[58:16] after you receive the Holy Ghost because
[58:19] he had anointed me to preach the gospel
[58:22] to the poor he has sent me to heal the
[58:24] brokenhearted to preach Deliverance to
[58:26] the captain or praise the Lord
[58:27] recovering the sight of the blind that
[58:30] was me we were all blind and said it
[58:32] literally them that are bruised to
[58:34] preach the acceptable
[58:36] year of the Lord
[58:38] he closed them over
[58:41] and he gave it to the minister and sat
[58:43] down and all eyes were on him you
[58:47] fast enough and they're like man we've
[58:49] never heard this right now right you
[58:52] know why but they never had the word
[58:53] read the book they had never had the
[58:55] word read the word that's right they
[58:57] were reading the word but the word was
[58:58] reading the word he made a lie because
[59:00] he began to say to them this day this
[59:03] scripture in this building is being
[59:05] fulfilled amen amen let's follow this
[59:08] your Lord thank you for this time that
[59:10] we'll have thank you for this
[59:11] opportunity to speak to the greatest
[59:13] people that ever walked in the face of
[59:15] the Earth and Lord you know I mean that
[59:17] truly there's no greater office than
[59:20] being here Lord speaking to your people
[59:22] yes father I pray that you should be
[59:24] with each one Lord open our blinded Eyes
[59:26] Lord open our ears that we may see and
[59:29] hear you Lord you be the active
[59:31] participant in this service Lord please
[59:32] don't be a bystander Lord come in and
[59:34] take over father and you be the one to
[59:36] speak to the people and the one that
[59:38] revealed to him follow him there'd be
[59:40] any sick here Lord I know there's
[59:41] there's many ones that are there are
[59:43] afflicted in the body I pray Lord that
[59:46] you'd give them a quickening power today
[59:47] yes you could heal their body Lord it'd
[59:50] be anybody sick here in their soul yes
[59:52] Lord we need more than anything we need
[59:54] a healing of the Soul father I pray that
[59:56] you would as the word goes for it then
[59:58] it will sanctify a group of people for
[1:00:01] this journey that we're on yes even
[1:00:03] brother Andre Lord
[1:00:05] and the work he's doing here finally one
[1:00:08] of the most humble men I know
[1:00:11] was a meekest man I know
[1:00:13] but meekness is not weakness
[1:00:18] and I appreciate it Lord I Thank you for
[1:00:20] putting him in my life and they put him
[1:00:23] in our brothers and sisters right here
[1:00:24] well
[1:00:25] just be with each one now take care of
[1:00:27] some Jesus
[1:00:29] okay
[1:00:31] all right so get this party we want to
[1:00:34] look at
[1:00:37] Luke 4 verse 17 there's a little bit up
[1:00:41] or down down okay
[1:00:56] thank you
[1:00:57] so the word anointing means
[1:01:00] when you anoint something it means now
[1:01:02] this is literally what it means it means
[1:01:04] to smear something on you
[1:01:06] or spread a liquid
[1:01:09] because that's what they did in the Old
[1:01:10] Testament they put oil on the priest and
[1:01:14] anointed them with a literal oil that's
[1:01:16] right now we know that that was done
[1:01:19] away with in the Old Testament but now
[1:01:21] we see anointings in the spiritual realm
[1:01:23] we see anointings where it falls on you
[1:01:26] like I know many in this building is as
[1:01:28] old as we all are we've had we've had
[1:01:30] different anointings you've had an
[1:01:31] anointing to maybe speak in tongues
[1:01:33] where you had an anointing to do this or
[1:01:34] you had an anointing like I had one time
[1:01:36] where it felt like rain was falling on
[1:01:38] just the sweetest raindrops that was
[1:01:41] falling on me and I didn't want it to
[1:01:42] stop I wanted to stay there but of
[1:01:44] course it goes and moves because it's an
[1:01:46] anointing it doesn't stay and dwell like
[1:01:48] the Holy Ghost does everybody wins we'll
[1:01:51] get it somewhere because we're anointed
[1:01:52] for a purpose yes every one of us even
[1:01:55] the anointed ones at the end time
[1:01:57] they're anointed for a purpose right
[1:01:59] right even we're going to read here in
[1:02:01] the Book of Ezekiel
[1:02:11] amen so the word anointing me to smear
[1:02:14] or spread like a liquid also means to
[1:02:17] concentrate but in the spiritual realm
[1:02:19] it means a supreme quickening power and
[1:02:23] where we were brother I'm saying it was
[1:02:24] supreme power and control we know that
[1:02:26] all right we'll get to that that was the
[1:02:28] greatest anointing and that's what we're
[1:02:30] looking at brother Joe we're look we're
[1:02:31] not looking so much for a a shout or or
[1:02:34] speaking in tongues or or even healing
[1:02:37] we need healing absolutely we need a
[1:02:40] handle of our body but until we get this
[1:02:42] thing changed it's still going to get
[1:02:43] old it's going to get old and keep
[1:02:46] getting Fallen keep falling apart and
[1:02:48] keep having to put parts back on
[1:02:51] amen so in the spirit realm though we
[1:02:55] see that it's a supreme quick and
[1:02:56] empowered because when the anointing
[1:02:58] came on Jesus he said I've been anointed
[1:03:01] to preach amen
[1:03:04] he watched the preacher right but he was
[1:03:06] anointed to be the preacher that's right
[1:03:08] he was an anointed before the the the
[1:03:11] religious people of the day let's say
[1:03:13] the the Pharisees and Sadducees he was
[1:03:16] in church he opened that book and man
[1:03:18] they never heard a guy on a priest like
[1:03:19] this why there was anointing on it amen
[1:03:21] right even the way he probably said the
[1:03:24] same words that the priests have said
[1:03:25] for years and years and years but he he
[1:03:28] read I'm there way different than they
[1:03:30] did and why because he made it personal
[1:03:32] now come on I want us to make it
[1:03:34] personal amen
[1:03:38] the project Ronnie uh Johnson gosh well
[1:03:41] I want one for myself I'm just going to
[1:03:43] be selfish when it comes to that how
[1:03:45] long time to anoint me I want God to
[1:03:46] save me that's okay I want everybody to
[1:03:48] be saved but save me hard yeah all right
[1:03:51] all right so in the spirit realm it's a
[1:03:54] supreme court and in power so keep that
[1:03:56] in the back of your head yes
[1:03:58] I'm not going to be real fast I'm going
[1:04:00] to slow down a little bit because we got
[1:04:01] a little bit of time yes
[1:04:03] I don't have a button in my mouth but I
[1:04:05] do have a watch and it stops
[1:04:08] okay let's go to Ezekiel 28-14
[1:04:12] Thou Art the anointed cherub that cover
[1:04:17] it now this is God speaking of Lucifer
[1:04:19] that's right right he's not speaking of
[1:04:22] Michael he's not speaking of his Angel
[1:04:25] he's speaking of the one he created to
[1:04:28] be the worship angel
[1:04:30] cast and used to hate for me to tell
[1:04:32] them that you know I'd be preaching
[1:04:34] along my spinning even boy knows he's
[1:04:36] laughing I remember but they Addison
[1:04:38] look for example you know but I told him
[1:04:41] I said Satan was God's first song leader
[1:04:45] it was an anointed child he was supposed
[1:04:48] to be and look that coverage so we had a
[1:04:51] recovering on him he had an anointing on
[1:04:52] him and he looked he wasn't ugly he was
[1:04:54] beautiful
[1:04:56] and I have set these so that was upon
[1:04:59] the holy mountain of God in other words
[1:05:00] he walked around where God was that's
[1:05:02] right amen thou has walked up and down
[1:05:05] in the midst of the stone of the fire
[1:05:06] that was perfect
[1:05:09] in thy ways from the day that thou were
[1:05:13] created so now remember Satan had a
[1:05:16] beginning
[1:05:17] but we've got to see that we don't amen
[1:05:20] right amen right and then we got to pull
[1:05:23] this thing apart just for a minute
[1:05:24] because
[1:05:25] Lucifer was created
[1:05:28] and anointed yes right and by the way he
[1:05:31] was created and anointed he was created
[1:05:33] and anointed the Bible says until
[1:05:35] iniquity was found in so he made a
[1:05:38] choice even Satan had a choice right
[1:05:40] right and by Whitney they didn't have a
[1:05:43] choice listen God had a choice he didn't
[1:05:45] have to choose you
[1:05:46] he helped me you for nothing right right
[1:05:50] he doesn't need an air that he created
[1:05:52] the bread he don't need something to
[1:05:53] stand on he was before all of us amen
[1:05:55] but we sure need help amen amen we sure
[1:05:59] need him and in needing him there's our
[1:06:02] father amen amen as I'm telling the
[1:06:05] church the other day we'll probably
[1:06:06] Communists when you call somebody
[1:06:08] brother brother Joel now I don't care
[1:06:10] what skin color he is he's my brother
[1:06:12] he's in the family of God so when we say
[1:06:15] God bless you brother God bless you
[1:06:17] Sister you have pulled them into your
[1:06:20] family yeah
[1:06:22] yeah and we have the same father
[1:06:25] we have the same thing for so I say
[1:06:27] brother Donnie I'm not just saying all
[1:06:29] this brother Donnie no he's my mother
[1:06:30] yeah
[1:06:32] back here they're my literal brother and
[1:06:34] sister all right but you are my literal
[1:06:37] brothers and sisters in the gospel give
[1:06:39] us as much in the family of God and a
[1:06:41] lot of us that don't have family that
[1:06:43] are serving the lord but your church
[1:06:45] family is your the best family you've
[1:06:47] got that's right amen amen
[1:06:50] I'm just fortunate that my family's my
[1:06:52] church family did yeah a natural family
[1:06:55] but there was a guy named Lucifer he was
[1:06:57] created and anointed everybody with me
[1:07:00] right he had a beginning and he's going
[1:07:02] to have an end even though he's listen
[1:07:04] that anointing has not come off of him
[1:07:06] that's right that anointing is still on
[1:07:09] it he's just using it different than
[1:07:12] what God give it to him for in the first
[1:07:14] place everybody with me here right so in
[1:07:17] Genesis 1 I know most of everybody that
[1:07:20] goes my church realizes that we're gonna
[1:07:22] rock about dentists in one of just about
[1:07:24] every sermon I preach to me Genesis 1 26
[1:07:28] and 27 tells everything Redemption
[1:07:31] everything is going to happen where
[1:07:32] you're going what you're doing you're
[1:07:34] going to have a Dominion you're going to
[1:07:35] have power you're going to be male and
[1:07:37] female and brother Joel was saying
[1:07:38] they're having a problem with that
[1:07:39] nowadays I am not
[1:07:52] says uh
[1:07:54] and God standing there in eternity he
[1:07:58] said I need somebody to talk to I need
[1:08:00] someone to Fellowship
[1:08:02] I need a family yes and they're inside
[1:08:06] me right and I'm going to get them out
[1:08:10] God can only do that amen and he knew
[1:08:13] exactly who they were now listen this
[1:08:14] Genesis 1 26 man
[1:08:16] was not every man that was created in
[1:08:18] the place of this Earth and by the way
[1:08:20] all right no brother I know brother
[1:08:22] Andre you know because he's heard it for
[1:08:24] years and years Genesis 1 26 is God's
[1:08:27] people Amen to me that is an extension
[1:08:30] of God yes it's actually God in another
[1:08:33] core because I know it says he created
[1:08:35] but remember you got to look at that
[1:08:37] word as he fashioned
[1:08:40] he fashioned a group of people in His
[1:08:43] image
[1:08:44] am I women but now he created Satan over
[1:08:46] here separate
[1:08:47] created him give him an anointing give
[1:08:50] him a job all right these people this
[1:08:53] Genesis 1 26 group of people it's not an
[1:08:57] anointing that's right amen amen if the
[1:09:01] person of God in another form called
[1:09:03] writing yes so you didn't have a
[1:09:05] beginning but yeah you were formed you
[1:09:07] were created to land you know God
[1:09:09] created a man in his own image and him
[1:09:11] is where God created him male and female
[1:09:13] greedy to them I don't mean the Bible
[1:09:15] for that
[1:09:16] recorded so many times but look and what
[1:09:19] happened whiskey you say well I still
[1:09:21] see that word created you know that
[1:09:24] all the computers all these Ventures all
[1:09:27] this steel
[1:09:28] your car that you drove here was in the
[1:09:31] Garden of Eden that's right amen
[1:09:34] nothing you look at the same
[1:09:36] it was laying out there in the elements
[1:09:39] and and then all of a sudden in about
[1:09:42] 1912 or somewhere I might have named
[1:09:44] Henry Ford he created an automobile he
[1:09:47] didn't create it
[1:09:49] like God would create it he created it
[1:09:52] from the substance that was already here
[1:09:53] that's right right so he fashioned or
[1:09:56] formed a car all right we brought that
[1:09:58] car it had the beginning
[1:10:01] but the elements that it happened
[1:10:04] the elements you were originally made of
[1:10:06] will never go away this is right he
[1:10:09] fashioned you in His image and then he
[1:10:12] knew you would come here and he knew you
[1:10:13] would want it so he added there to give
[1:10:15] it to you he didn't have to go
[1:10:17] scrambling through through his inventory
[1:10:19] and go Joel Brown I don't know if I knew
[1:10:22] no we already knew you were going to be
[1:10:24] here in that Genesis 126 man like I said
[1:10:27] it's not in the morning it's an image
[1:10:29] it's God an extension of God it's
[1:10:32] something that he wanted to express and
[1:10:34] he wanted to be able to see but we know
[1:10:36] what happened in regarding the people
[1:10:38] right right Lucifer
[1:10:41] was so anointed he knew what the plan of
[1:10:45] God was and he stepped in all right make
[1:10:47] a long story short we know what happened
[1:10:49] in the garden I don't have to go through
[1:10:50] it all right and that marred as the
[1:10:53] prophet of God said Mark the masterpiece
[1:10:56] but remember brother Graham said The
[1:10:58] Mooring of the Masterpiece is what made
[1:11:00] it the masterpiece that's right here
[1:11:04] right maybe your worst enemy but God
[1:11:07] wanted you in this human class
[1:11:11] foreign
[1:11:17] your new birth is not your anointing and
[1:11:21] it's not your adoption that's right
[1:11:23] right amenities
[1:11:27] so you've got your you've got your
[1:11:30] regular verb We're not gonna talk about
[1:11:31] that anymore we're gonna everybody's
[1:11:33] born again it will open my mind okay
[1:11:34] everybody's morning all right so
[1:11:36] everybody has a piece of that Genesis 1
[1:11:38] 26 in your soul the only you were was
[1:11:42] burnt out the nature that was attached
[1:11:44] to your goal was burned done away with
[1:11:46] the old used Dead all right amen now
[1:11:49] gold used to tell lies you've got two
[1:11:51] husbands and you can't do that right
[1:11:53] right no husband can't be putting out in
[1:11:55] divorces put in the closet he's got to
[1:11:57] be d-e-a-d dead right
[1:11:59] but in in killing that then God brings
[1:12:03] the new birth or the birth to you that
[1:12:05] he wanted in the first place you know
[1:12:07] amen that is 126 man in the Garden of
[1:12:10] Eden he wanted you to be there he wanted
[1:12:12] you to come the way he wanted you to
[1:12:14] come by Spoken Word not by the way they
[1:12:17] came Hey listen everybody in this

[1:20:00] God will do in one year what all
[1:20:02] theologies failed to do in 2000 yeah so
[1:20:05] you wait till the anointing of the
[1:20:07] church really strikes home to that
[1:20:10] Faithful Little Remnant yes amen after
[1:20:15] the doors of the Gentile churches close
[1:20:17] oh God will anoint a church then so
[1:20:19] there's an anointing coming in my folks
[1:20:20] my brothers you believe that there's an
[1:20:23] anointing coming that we've not even had
[1:20:25] before right right
[1:20:27] now
[1:20:29] God will anoint a church then he who
[1:20:32] felt me letting me filthy still he who's
[1:20:34] righteous let him be righteous to them
[1:20:35] he who is Holy let him be holy still and
[1:20:39] God will anoint the church with the
[1:20:40] power of God and things will take place
[1:20:43] yes not only that then but he's doing it
[1:20:47] now amen right so there's not there's no
[1:20:49] there is one coming a great one coming
[1:20:51] but there's one he was saying there's
[1:20:53] one here too 55 that's right there is
[1:20:56] one
[1:20:58] in
[1:21:00] word form
[1:21:02] the words got to be anointing all right
[1:21:05] it doesn't matter if you you're the
[1:21:07] words got to be anointed and we know the
[1:21:09] words are on it and whenever when it
[1:21:11] comes into you and it won't shoot all
[1:21:13] right but let's look good for him yet
[1:21:14] with the Old Testament in types and
[1:21:17] shadows because we know you can't do
[1:21:19] away with the Old Testament the Old
[1:21:20] Testament is given as what we said for
[1:21:22] an example the Bible says for an example
[1:21:25] for us that the end of Earth was coming
[1:21:28] through so he's for us to look back I
[1:21:31] mean how many people have heard uh
[1:21:33] you know teachings on Abraham and I know
[1:21:36] some of you may have came from another
[1:21:37] denomination or or something that they
[1:21:40] yeah they'll talk about this and Father
[1:21:42] Abraham but they never really knew
[1:21:45] who Abraham was the prophet of God knew
[1:21:49] whoever it was
[1:21:51] and who Abraham was amen and he taught
[1:21:54] us the difference in the two amen right
[1:21:57] amen Abram didn't have the promised son
[1:22:01] Abraham had the promise sign right so
[1:22:04] there had to be a change and then then
[1:22:06] thank God uh Prophet told us they had a
[1:22:08] body change
[1:22:26] 99 year old
[1:22:29] Sarah
[1:22:30] and he wants her oh she had a body tank
[1:22:34] so that's what we're looking for but we
[1:22:36] got to meet my cousin this first you got
[1:22:39] to meet God in human flesh before that
[1:22:41] happens we'll talk about that yesterday
[1:22:43] Exodus 30 verse 30. we'll just read this
[1:22:47] real quick I know we understand this
[1:22:49] we've already talked many times
[1:22:51] Thou shalt anoint Aaron and his sons and
[1:22:54] consecrate them so they literally poured
[1:22:56] this oil onto these uh uh to Aaron and
[1:23:00] his sons for them to go do the job in
[1:23:03] the temple all right everybody it was a
[1:23:06] holy anointing oil and I was just
[1:23:08] paraphrase just the same time God told
[1:23:10] him he said Do Not Duplicate this right
[1:23:15] Do Not Duplicate this Holy Ghost it's
[1:23:17] only going to come one way and it's
[1:23:19] going to come by justification
[1:23:21] sanctification and the baptism of the
[1:23:23] Holy Ghost it's not going to come now
[1:23:25] listen there's a lot of people going to
[1:23:26] be anointed about the Holy Ghost is
[1:23:27] going to happen
[1:23:29] you can get why to do on this all right
[1:23:31] that's the truth right this shall be a
[1:23:34] holy anointing oil unto me through your
[1:23:36] Generations
[1:23:38] you shall not make any like it after the
[1:23:41] composition of it it is Holy leave it
[1:23:44] alone he said whoever compounded it or
[1:23:47] make it this anointing oil just regular
[1:23:49] oil
[1:23:51] he's going to be cut off from people
[1:23:53] they're kicking him out there to keep
[1:23:55] you out you're not an Israelite anymore
[1:23:56] that's how that's how strong it is
[1:23:59] not just in the Old Testament though
[1:24:02] all right they're by waiting so now
[1:24:04] Moses let's look at Moses the Bible
[1:24:06] tells us that that Moses killed an
[1:24:09] Egyptian and Moses made a lot of
[1:24:11] mistakes but when Moses was speaking for
[1:24:14] God his face shown so much
[1:24:17] until they had to turn away and had to
[1:24:19] cover this face now that was an
[1:24:21] anointing what a strong anointing that
[1:24:22] was right because it would come off of
[1:24:25] him he didn't keep that all the time but
[1:24:26] he had an anointing to speak instead of
[1:24:29] God or in God's dead because remember
[1:24:32] when he said flies flies came when he
[1:24:34] said frogs frogs came there was a
[1:24:36] creation in his voice now remember Moses
[1:24:39] was not born again all right am I
[1:24:42] winning sure no more again the Old
[1:24:45] Testament there was no one born again
[1:24:46] that's right they had anointings
[1:24:50] but they weren't born again
[1:24:52] right okay
[1:24:54] even John the Baptist
[1:24:57] my morning
[1:24:58] yeah
[1:25:00] I swear a difference I mean think about
[1:25:02] that for a little while
[1:25:04] 1954 concerned we have a good cheer
[1:25:09] watch it look at Jonah the prophet
[1:25:12] after receiving inspiration that kept
[1:25:15] him alive in the whale's belly what an
[1:25:18] anointing to being a whale's belly yes
[1:25:20] and preached with such inspiration to a
[1:25:23] seat in the size of Saint Louis
[1:25:25] all out of repented
[1:25:27] and then after the spirit left him he
[1:25:30] sat under a little tree in a gourd tree
[1:25:32] and prayed God let me die
[1:25:34] all right look at any lines of the
[1:25:36] Prophet after calling fire down out of
[1:25:38] Heaven called Rain Out of Heaven the
[1:25:40] same day the spirit left him he run into
[1:25:42] the Wilderness and
[1:25:44] Jezebel he was afraid of that woman
[1:25:47] right so that's the anointing that came
[1:25:50] on and then that anointing came off and
[1:25:52] he became just a normal person all right
[1:25:54] so we'll look at something though
[1:25:56] because there's something the Bible
[1:25:58] tells us about one individual
[1:26:02] that says you see the spirit
[1:26:05] the sin all right yes and remain right
[1:26:09] amen amen right that's right we know who
[1:26:12] that is all right so that's what we're
[1:26:14] getting to
[1:26:15] for now look at Samson Samson now listen
[1:26:17] Samson what they look like Arnold
[1:26:19] Schwarzenegger
[1:26:21] you know the the when you watch the
[1:26:23] Samson move in when you've got
[1:26:26] they're all packed out and everything no
[1:26:28] hey it's a little big kid
[1:26:37] that Chevy little pretty little curls
[1:26:39] but when the anointing that he was
[1:26:42] purpose for
[1:26:44] right yes anointed for a purpose he was
[1:26:47] anointed for that purpose to destroy the
[1:26:50] foolish thing as long as he kept that
[1:26:53] anointing on him he was oh he could pick
[1:26:55] up tons yes yeah tons those Gates weigh
[1:26:58] tons not just hundreds of pound times
[1:27:00] right he just pick him up go set him
[1:27:02] down that see that was a mystery it
[1:27:04] wouldn't be a mystery if he was as big
[1:27:06] as Arnold Schwarzenegger or somebody
[1:27:07] like that that wouldn't be the mystery
[1:27:09] they know always just wrong he works out
[1:27:11] now he's a little Shrimp Boy and he's
[1:27:13] walking around all humped over you know
[1:27:15] and all of a sudden he kills a thousand
[1:27:17] of them well that's why they wanted to
[1:27:19] know what where he got his anointing
[1:27:21] from where'd you get your strength from
[1:27:22] all right right of course we know what
[1:27:25] happened
[1:27:26] yeah amen he lost all that because he
[1:27:29] got out of the world going that's right
[1:27:31] but remember in the end he took out more
[1:27:33] than he did
[1:27:36] I want to be that way I want to be if it
[1:27:38] comes down to the end of the girl I want
[1:27:39] to be where God says enter in you've
[1:27:42] destroyed more in the end of your life
[1:27:44] is in the first feelings out of here to
[1:27:46] destroy him off right well here let's
[1:27:48] come to David now remember as brother of
[1:27:51] Joel was preaching last night
[1:27:52] check yourself just a minute
[1:27:55] David was anointed to be king that's
[1:27:58] right
[1:27:59] first Samuel 16 10. I want you to look
[1:28:02] at this real you know you believe in
[1:28:04] numbers and numerology yes we believe in
[1:28:06] touch we believe in numerology we had a
[1:28:09] Prophet come and tell us what a five
[1:28:10] what a four what a three what a six what
[1:28:12] a two what an eight was yes yes
[1:28:15] it was right he told us all those
[1:28:17] numbers so let's look at this in first
[1:28:19] name of 16 because David and and taking
[1:28:22] nothing away from Harper Jones said it
[1:28:24] took the faith and it took David to be
[1:28:26] at the right place at the right time but
[1:28:28] remember David had an anointed
[1:28:30] amen that's right that's right amen amen
[1:28:34] he was anointing for his kindness but
[1:28:37] remember though he was anointed to be
[1:28:38] king but remember he was anointed as a
[1:28:41] boy he did not become king for years
[1:28:43] after right right yeah
[1:28:47] that's annual anointing now here here's
[1:28:49] the situation now
[1:28:52] God
[1:28:54] listen God send a prophet
[1:28:57] right that's right to anoint someone to
[1:29:00] be a king
[1:29:02] his name was Simon that's right that
[1:29:05] sounds familiar boxing a problem
[1:29:07] God said a problem give me anointing oil
[1:29:12] foreign first Samuel 16 10 says again
[1:29:15] Jesse made Seven of his sons to pass
[1:29:19] before Simon
[1:29:21] sounds good doesn't it
[1:29:24] but in seven Church ages that wasn't
[1:29:26] somebody anointed to destroy the Giant
[1:29:29] that's right David was the eight point
[1:29:32] amen the Lord hath not chosen these
[1:29:36] and Samuel sending to Jesse or hear all
[1:29:40] thy children and he said they're
[1:29:42] reminded yet the youngest and behold and
[1:29:44] keepeth the sheep and he stands he's a
[1:29:46] smell planning but he's pretty standing
[1:29:49] infection for we will not sit down till
[1:29:51] we come now here's a prophet stand that
[1:29:52] the guy's going and he's got this
[1:29:54] anointing oil and God sent him to that
[1:29:56] place
[1:29:57] listen God sent
[1:30:00] him to your place yes amen
[1:30:03] and he sat and brought him in now he was
[1:30:06] running with all of the beautiful
[1:30:08] countless and good to look at good
[1:30:10] looking kid
[1:30:11] and the Lord said arise anoint him for
[1:30:15] this is him
[1:30:17] right
[1:30:18] because I'm sure Samuel money those
[1:30:20] seven boys they were probably big Paul
[1:30:22] Dyson he went over to this one and God
[1:30:24] said no he didn't feel anything it was
[1:30:27] nothing well
[1:30:32] so all I want to say this is there's
[1:30:34] gotta be a little more there's got to be
[1:30:36] something something's missing all right
[1:30:39] likely brother randomly questions and
[1:30:41] answers brother George yet got the new
[1:30:43] seal button he asked me yesterday or
[1:30:45] Friday brother George Smith he said
[1:30:48] what's what is the greatest part of the
[1:30:51] seal book to you
[1:30:53] and everybody would say silence and
[1:30:55] having their best or that the greatest
[1:30:59] uh time that brother Branham the quote
[1:31:01] that I love brother around a blade he
[1:31:03] was on the questions and answers on the
[1:31:05] seals that morning
[1:31:07] and he said you're not getting it
[1:31:10] yeah it's not for you right yes right
[1:31:14] amen now what he's saying he said you're
[1:31:17] not even supposed to get it that's what
[1:31:19] he said
[1:31:20] amen amen
[1:31:22] amen so that was somebody all right
[1:31:24] Hallelujah in 2023 yes that's gonna get
[1:31:27] it
[1:31:28] it was not born there let her know he
[1:31:31] failed them just like Samuel was like
[1:31:32] nope
[1:31:33] nope not that group
[1:31:36] nope not that good and he's probably
[1:31:38] going Lawrence
[1:31:44] they're going to live a good life uh
[1:31:47] they're going to live the message the
[1:31:48] best they can but there's a group coming
[1:31:50] hallelujah it's going to fall on every
[1:31:53] man and she's going to be an invincible
[1:31:56] Army amen amen all right thank you
[1:31:58] brother those words that arise anointing
[1:32:01] for this is he yes then Samuel put the
[1:32:04] heart of oil an anointed him in the
[1:32:06] midst of his brother I bet you they were
[1:32:08] probably looking at him a little bit
[1:32:09] sideways
[1:32:12] right David
[1:32:15] what this this end time right she looks
[1:32:19] horrible
[1:32:20] somebody told me one time and said you
[1:32:22] know you don't say Brad looks horrible I
[1:32:24] said brother the bride ain't never
[1:32:26] looked horrible that's right right you
[1:32:28] might be looking at mixed multitude
[1:32:29] foolish version but the bride has always
[1:32:32] been beautiful always will be beautiful
[1:32:34] you've got to find her all right all
[1:32:37] right because all Israel not Israel
[1:32:39] that's right I think Sam will cook the
[1:32:41] heart of oil and anoint him in the
[1:32:43] mission to try to scare the Lord look
[1:32:45] the spirit of the Lord Came Upon David
[1:32:46] from that day forward yeah
[1:32:52] Daddy's house there had been a war yet
[1:32:55] there have been a life we didn't go out
[1:32:57] maybe the teenager you know probably
[1:32:59] seven foot tall by land but but he had
[1:33:02] to wait a little while but right
[1:33:04] so that would come up
[1:33:08] let's set this scene like a brother did
[1:33:10] last night
[1:33:12] Dave's keeping the Sheep now listen he's
[1:33:14] been on it and put a clown on him yet
[1:33:16] right he has not said on the throne but
[1:33:19] he's been anointed
[1:33:22] that's right so and I'm sure that
[1:33:25] anointing oil probably he probably
[1:33:28] washed it off I'm sure he still didn't
[1:33:30] have that anointing hole that he had you
[1:33:32] know for years back now he washed it off
[1:33:34] but listen you can't watch the anointing
[1:33:36] no sir all for yourself you can't watch
[1:33:37] the anointing out of a prayer cloth
[1:33:40] you can't watch the anointing off once
[1:33:43] it comes on you and the Bible said and
[1:33:45] Sacco said this is going to be our King
[1:33:47] right here amen
[1:33:51] I don't care how long it takes
[1:33:55] all right right 60 years since you
[1:33:58] probably left
[1:33:59] no matter how long it takes
[1:34:01] you well we can
[1:34:06] what a consolation if you'll believe
[1:34:08] that
[1:34:09] listen try this he believed what the
[1:34:12] prophet said
[1:34:13] try that sometime that's it bro
[1:34:19] okay
[1:34:21] so David he's not going he's not sit
[1:34:24] down going well I'm king I don't have to
[1:34:26] do this sheep thing in the morning I you
[1:34:29] know I don't like them no lab I'm just
[1:34:30] kind of just sit right here under this
[1:34:32] tree and God's gonna just make me King
[1:34:35] no no you know why he was my pain God
[1:34:38] knew he wouldn't do that
[1:34:40] amen God knew it would be frivolous in
[1:34:43] his Christian experience amen he would
[1:34:46] continue on even though the anointing
[1:34:48] was not always on it
[1:34:51] that's right but one day
[1:34:53] one day in his walk
[1:34:58] he hears a noise
[1:35:04] you know he kind of sneaks up and even
[1:35:06] this even his brothers
[1:35:07] his older brothers are like what are you
[1:35:09] doing here
[1:35:11] what are you going to say in this church
[1:35:15] right right what are you doing in these
[1:35:17] meetings yeah what are you doing here
[1:35:20] you're supposed to be out there you you
[1:35:22] didn't have a sign or a Wonder in all
[1:35:26] your life
[1:35:27] they said boy aren't you remember I
[1:35:29] killed a bear one time
[1:35:31] I killed the line at one time so I had a
[1:35:33] little bit of experience here I just
[1:35:35] never killed a person yet
[1:35:37] okay look remember he went to the to the
[1:35:40] camp and here's what here's all the
[1:35:42] other Church ages standing around going
[1:35:44] will you go in here
[1:35:49] we thought you were you know you need to
[1:35:52] go back and take care of your sheep oh
[1:35:54] Daddy's calling you
[1:35:57] David may have turned around and said
[1:35:59] yeah I probably better leave that
[1:36:01] there's there's no like me being here
[1:36:04] but when he turned he heard a voice
[1:36:07] yes that he didn't like amen that's
[1:36:10] right he heard a strange sound right
[1:36:13] come from across the valley yes
[1:36:16] yes and that strange sound wouldn't shut
[1:36:19] up
[1:36:21] he just kept it fine the armies of
[1:36:24] Israel yes he kept defying he defied
[1:36:27] that he signify this whole Army
[1:36:30] send me one
[1:36:32] oh he didn't know
[1:36:36] uh they haven't paid money it's final
[1:36:40] final
[1:36:53] and he looked at Goliath and he didn't
[1:36:55] measure him up
[1:36:59] you know what he saw
[1:37:01] he saw a crown and a throne yes right
[1:37:05] that's right amen
[1:37:07] amen yes
[1:37:09] sir he saw a crown that's wrong yes sir
[1:37:13] he saw a promise
[1:37:15] because he believed what his Prophet
[1:37:16] said amen amen so how could he die
[1:37:21] right how could he die you tell me how
[1:37:23] David could die if Samuel was a true
[1:37:25] Prophet a true anointing was on him he
[1:37:27] was going to be king
[1:37:29] why
[1:37:31] [Music]
[1:37:33] you're uncomfortable if you realize that
[1:37:36] we are doing what the prophet told us he
[1:37:39] has anointed us Amen to leave this place
[1:37:41] standing up not seek for you amen bro
[1:37:46] he was a flip of the radar
[1:37:50] that's what we gotta look at death
[1:37:52] because all David saw was I'm gonna be
[1:37:55] king I gotta get through this though I
[1:37:58] gotta take this test
[1:37:59] right
[1:38:02] [Music]
[1:38:04] deaf where do you stand right yes right
[1:38:07] amen great where's your picture yeah
[1:38:11] one day folk we're gonna do the same
[1:38:13] thing with them
[1:38:15] Daniel call up your sleeve and you'll
[1:38:17] just wipe it off it off listen when we
[1:38:19] say death
[1:38:21] Christian if you say death you got that
[1:38:24] little tangle in your in your in your
[1:38:26] whatever you want to say
[1:38:28] coach we're human we see that
[1:38:31] we see what that thought
[1:38:34] but why are we teaching what that is
[1:38:37] let's teach what life is
[1:38:40] and Goliath was only just a blip in his
[1:38:43] radar Goliath was not 9 feet or 14 feet
[1:38:46] tall
[1:38:48] he was just an obstacle that David had
[1:38:51] to get through to get to the front amen
[1:38:53] so that's the way I see that I see that
[1:38:55] David was anointed to be king sure he
[1:38:58] believed that so much
[1:39:00] give a bear get a line didn't fall in
[1:39:03] the bed come up to go out because he
[1:39:04] wasn't like to have I need to go back I
[1:39:06] need to find my cool book all right
[1:39:09] I need to go talk about laundry I mean I
[1:39:11] really got to get you know nobody said
[1:39:13] hey you quick Define the army of God or
[1:39:17] something is going to happen to you
[1:39:18] buddy that's right that's the same thing
[1:39:20] definitely been defying us for years
[1:39:23] but there's an anointing on this ride in
[1:39:26] the end time for somebody to stand up
[1:39:28] and say yeah
[1:39:30] you've been destroyed all right amen
[1:39:33] thank you amen you show us a fairy tale
[1:39:35] well we'll do your funeral that's right
[1:39:37] come on that's right
[1:39:41] am I right amen I'm just playing we're
[1:39:45] either going to go in here we're going
[1:39:46] to go out of here standing up or we're
[1:39:48] going to have to come hunt for the
[1:39:49] resurrection no shame in either one
[1:39:51] that's right no shame in England not at
[1:39:53] all right
[1:39:56] but don't you want to be here again
[1:40:01] I've heard about this great thing that's
[1:40:03] come this great tarantula this great
[1:40:05] Resurrection this great coming back
[1:40:07] together where I don't move my finger
[1:40:10] anywhere
[1:40:12] right we're this glorified body yes it's
[1:40:15] going to just materialize amen
[1:40:18] it's not fair Capital it's my favorite
[1:40:21] thing you watch all that junk on DC and
[1:40:24] comic books that's just the kind of
[1:40:26] what's going to happen to you when they
[1:40:27] morph into this and morph into that you
[1:40:29] know they become superhuman but remember
[1:40:31] they all got a flaw
[1:40:37] whatever you want to put in that there's
[1:40:40] not been one that stood and said I'm the
[1:40:42] Champion
[1:40:43] right and never been undefeated well we
[1:40:45] have one amen and he's not in the comic
[1:40:48] book he's in your heart yes sir
[1:40:55] well let's be David let the leaders
[1:40:58] David and throwing stones let's just
[1:40:59] believe that we the Bible tells us we
[1:41:02] are to be what priests and
[1:41:06] King so we've been anointed right right
[1:41:10] finally anointed word and we have an
[1:41:12] anointed Prophet come and give us a
[1:41:14] neural in the word for an anointed
[1:41:15] people amen amen so Lord I looked at
[1:41:19] that real funny when they said smear you
[1:41:22] know when anointed means to smear like
[1:41:23] peanut butter on a sandwich well you

[1:41:35] you want
[1:41:38] I'd like to be smeared by God yes amen
[1:41:41] amen trying to go out of service without
[1:41:44] being as well in 1965.
[1:41:47] good grace
[1:41:49] listen we got a whole time Memorial yes
[1:41:51] right
[1:41:54] see how the Holy Spirit now let's look
[1:41:56] at this we got to look at the flip side
[1:41:58] because there's pops anointed one
[1:42:00] there's an anointing coming and it's
[1:42:03] here now that's false yeah the Holy
[1:42:05] Ghost is not fault the anointing end
[1:42:07] right
[1:42:08] but really brother and Paul didn't Point
[1:42:10] some false anointed ones right well now
[1:42:14] look here's we're trying to do a lot of
[1:42:15] service this is right about the time
[1:42:16] when you're preaching that I'm not going
[1:42:17] to 65. he said see how the Holy Spirit
[1:42:20] can anoint a man
[1:42:21] but it's got to be in the order
[1:42:24] of the anointing
[1:42:26] right
[1:42:28] yummy it's got to be in the order of the
[1:42:32] anointing
[1:42:34] the outside Spirit can be Anointed with
[1:42:37] the Holy Ghost and the soul is darkest
[1:42:40] picture that's right amen folks that's
[1:42:42] why we've had people come along as you
[1:42:44] have here we've had at our church where
[1:42:46] they come in and then disappear yes amen
[1:42:49] but we had one this brother set on the
[1:42:52] front row and this was the greatest
[1:42:53] thing since last bread and he was like
[1:42:55] right on the front rows like Dad said
[1:42:57] though it was like a candle that burned
[1:42:59] both hands and we burn out real quick
[1:43:01] right amen disappear
[1:43:04] give thought he was a candidate for
[1:43:06] being right
[1:43:07] but you didn't get it in here he just
[1:43:10] got in the morning he got caught up in
[1:43:12] the moment
[1:43:13] I don't want you to get caught up in a
[1:43:15] moment no sir the only time I was get
[1:43:17] caught up and then the moment it went
[1:43:19] from an eye amen all right
[1:43:22] the taco bird grows on the same water
[1:43:24] that builds that puts life into wheat
[1:43:27] but at the bottom he's still a go to
[1:43:29] work it's rejoicing blooming got life
[1:43:32] doing everything that the wheat does
[1:43:35] soul is still a customer
[1:43:37] false teachers can rise teaching all
[1:43:40] kind of trinitarianism and everything
[1:43:41] else and be Anointed with the Holy Ghost
[1:43:46] and perform just as many miracles as the
[1:43:50] true gospel can but by the word their
[1:43:54] fault that's right that's right man wow
[1:43:57] how you like that tremendous but
[1:43:59] remember brother Round Lake system and
[1:44:01] he may say specific he's got to be in
[1:44:02] the order of the anointing
[1:44:08] [Music]
[1:44:10] 1963 brother around my world Fallen
[1:44:12] apart
[1:44:14] he finds out he said we find out the
[1:44:16] same things in place of Egypt when Moses
[1:44:18] led the children of Israel the whole
[1:44:19] Egyptian system had become corrupt well
[1:44:22] pray to God did the same thing right
[1:44:23] here all right whole places become
[1:44:26] corrupt we find out now and take it away
[1:44:28] from God sent an anointed messenger
[1:44:31] amen down there when did it work
[1:44:34] it was to fulfill his word
[1:44:37] that's right you say it wasn't to
[1:44:39] fulfill his work yes he told Abraham
[1:44:42] that's exactly what he would do and
[1:44:45] there had to be someone come on the
[1:44:47] scene at that time
[1:44:49] to make that word live right before them
[1:44:53] God sent Moses remember around many many
[1:44:55] times he said he had said Moses with
[1:44:57] Noah's message if it's in Noah would
[1:44:59] John I mean Governor mentioned no he
[1:45:01] sent him with the right message in other
[1:45:03] words you sent him with a writer
[1:45:04] anointed
[1:45:06] and there had to be someone come on the
[1:45:08] scene at that time to make that word
[1:45:10] live right before them
[1:45:13] so he said God sent Moses the first
[1:45:17] thing he promised to do he did
[1:45:20] because he was the anointed word for
[1:45:23] that hour
[1:45:24] he said he would judge the world God's
[1:45:26] word said I'll judge that Nation with
[1:45:28] Great Mighty wonders and signs there
[1:45:31] through the man just an ordinary man

[1:49:42] for not bad it's to get out of here and
[1:49:45] I promise you one thing folks Noah
[1:49:48] preached 120 years he was anointed to
[1:49:51] preach that message but one day God said
[1:49:54] that's it that's right I'm sure Noah hey
[1:49:57] friends I'm sure no one had other family
[1:50:00] members like you know Uncle and whatever
[1:50:03] sure and he was compelling them to come
[1:50:06] in like we do come to church come on
[1:50:08] come in here but one day God shut the
[1:50:10] door and said that's it that's right no

[1:50:26] enough we've been preaching for all
[1:50:28] these years there's a time to go up
[1:50:31] we went around horror we went to the
[1:50:33] desert we've done everything we we 60
[1:50:36] years

[1:50:55] morning you'll be pretty wrong you don't
[1:50:58] have wasted your time no the sun's gonna
[1:51:00] come up amen there will be a message it
[1:51:03] is a message but there will be a message
[1:51:04] anointed to carry us out the gifts amen
[1:51:07] and I believe we're under in that matter
[1:51:09] I truly do Matthew 3 verse 16. now here
[1:51:12] we are let's let's look at Jesus real
[1:51:13] quick yes let's give it to him we've
[1:51:16] been in anointing in the Old Testament
[1:51:17] which came on a group of people and it
[1:51:19] would leave it would come on David he'd
[1:51:21] write the great Psalms and he would do
[1:51:23] all these wonderful things but yet when
[1:51:24] it only came off of him he had his best
[1:51:25] friend killed
[1:51:31] a lot
[1:51:32] that's right
[1:51:34] General David would have died he hadn't
[1:51:36] had a problem there that's right what
[1:51:38] did David say bring up man here you know
[1:51:40] Nathan comes in and says you know this
[1:51:42] is still on the sheep and all this stuff
[1:51:43] they even don't sell prices David at the
[1:51:45] time he was King already you know I
[1:51:48] already had a crown on his head he said
[1:51:49] Grant what's my plan God bring them here
[1:51:56] probably look Davis said you're the man
[1:51:57] David that's right right
[1:51:59] you're the land he said the black he
[1:52:02] said but David I prayed for you yes
[1:52:05] amen all right Jesus in Matthew 17. amen
[1:52:09] John
[1:52:10] 17. amen amen thank you Lord to me
[1:52:14] that's my Lord's Prayer that's the other
[1:52:16] one but this is my Lord yes sir brother
[1:52:17] amen that's right Matthew 3 verse 16
[1:52:20] said Jesus when he was baptized went
[1:52:23] straight up out of the water and looked
[1:52:24] the heavens were open and he saw the
[1:52:26] spirit of God to send you like a dove
[1:52:28] and lighting upon him all right so we're
[1:52:31] watching this scene we're looking at
[1:52:32] this scene as a common buried we see
[1:52:34] Jesus we see John we see the baptism
[1:52:37] received come out of the water and then
[1:52:40] we see well Albert we see this this form
[1:52:43] this morning
[1:52:57] he pronounced it in the Book of Luke he
[1:53:00] said preach that's it amen 29 and a half
[1:53:04] years those silent years he might have
[1:53:06] said a few things but it wasn't for me
[1:53:07] and you that's right but that thing LED
[1:53:10] on him
[1:53:11] he had a three and a half year old job
[1:53:13] amen absolutely all right yes sir
[1:53:17] remember they tried to kill it many many
[1:53:20] times
[1:53:21] but without anointing on anything
[1:53:25] and what anointing was that
[1:53:30] yeah
[1:53:32] the voice that this is my beloved Son
[1:53:35] and whom I well pleased and they didn't
[1:53:37] say here to him either
[1:53:39] right that's right man had to wait for
[1:53:43] Matthew until he went until he lived a
[1:53:45] little bit longer through his journey
[1:53:47] almost getting ready to calibrate then
[1:53:49] he goes up on them
[1:53:51] um a mountain yes right and God adoption
[1:53:56] this is my beloved Son and whom I please
[1:53:58] did well hear you yeah
[1:54:00] amen so this first part there had to be
[1:54:04] something extra
[1:54:06] that was added
[1:54:09] thank you Lord yes remember you get
[1:54:11] everything you need for your journey but
[1:54:13] you just don't know how to use it right
[1:54:15] I believe the Bible even tells us that
[1:54:17] Jesus grew in what gracious knowledge
[1:54:20] and being made perfect
[1:54:22] amen being made perfect we came to
[1:54:26] author of our salvation
[1:54:28] it is Humanity he had issues amen right

[1:57:03] when I'm singing on the same thing she
[1:57:05] said I have done what God has told me to
[1:57:09] do
[1:57:10] as far as promises for his kids for kids
[1:57:12] or or whatever or XYZ but you got to put
[1:57:15] yourself in it too she said I'm done

[1:57:35] amen and then be baptized amen right so
[1:57:39] it says the latest said well I've done
[1:57:40] today you know she goes through and it
[1:57:42] is it is kind of a formula a little but
[1:57:44] the prophet taught us when we've done
[1:57:47] all we know to do when we lay them in
[1:57:49] the hands of God when we close our eyes
[1:57:51] and say God bear yours what are you
[1:57:53] saying when you've done everything to do
[1:57:54] he said stand Stan
[1:57:56] [Music]
[1:57:59] so you know what she's done she has

[1:58:13] may not be today gotta have patience
[1:58:15] right there yes

[1:58:31] all right
[1:58:32] I can't afford to you can't afford not
[1:58:35] to that's right amen
[1:58:37] all right
[1:58:39] well I got all these issues that singing
[1:58:42] in church in three weeks
[1:58:46] this one yeah

[1:58:54] that's our Anointed The anointing for
[1:58:56] the end time is for God to do what his
[1:58:58] word said it would do amen all in a
[1:59:00] nutshell yes that's what you and I are
[1:59:02] here to do say God you said it now
[1:59:05] you're gonna have to change my body I
[1:59:06] can't

[1:59:26] took that you're created in that image
[1:59:28] he had to get your mom and daddy here to
[1:59:31] bring you your image here but God must
[1:59:33] really like it because brother is not
[1:59:35] going to be six foreign
[1:59:45] [Music]
[1:59:56] [Music]
[2:00:16] saying I saw the Spirit
[2:00:19] that John was a prophet like brother
[2:00:21] Ryan was a prophet I was looking in one
[2:00:22] of your books you can see the hood
[2:00:23] remember brother Ryan said to the hood
[2:00:25] over that sister yeah I see he was
[2:00:26] looking at around but nobody had ever
[2:00:28] seen him right
[2:00:35] he was so much back and forth praise God
[2:00:38] we don't have to do
[2:00:41] I want to thank every one of y'all up
[2:00:44] I don't want to discern the half of you
[2:00:46] don't
[2:00:47] all right
[2:00:51] listen when they won they hooked brother
[2:00:52] around the neck he knew that they liked
[2:00:54] him or nothing new yeah I don't want all
[2:00:57] that I want to thank everybody
[2:00:59] it got me you know he drives everybody
[2:01:01] crazy but brother Brown because he don't
[2:01:02] want to come again that's what I mean
[2:01:04] about that he picked that person he
[2:01:07] picked that character
[2:01:08] that brother couldn't handle that you
[2:01:10] and I can't handle it anyway I love one
[2:01:14] another preacher said one time he said
[2:01:15] you know brother Ryan stood up maybe two
[2:01:17] or three times in his endurance his uh
[2:01:19] sermons and he'd say you know he said I
[2:01:22] can't keep a secret
[2:01:24] I just can't keep a secret
[2:01:26] well assistant God he can't keep a
[2:01:28] secret I'm glad he totally everything
[2:01:30] God told him that we needed amen I'm
[2:01:34] glad he didn't take that with him I'm
[2:01:35] glad he gave us 1100 sermon and that was
[2:01:38] God talking to me and you to remember
[2:01:40] amen
[2:01:41] before we've had the end time folks
[2:01:43] we've had it late in the Flash
[2:01:45] right here
[2:01:47] and moved on right
[2:01:51] so anyway so here's John here's John
[2:01:53] here's the prophet he's in the water and
[2:01:55] he baptized Jesus and he said I say
[2:01:57] saying I saw the Spirit descending from
[2:01:59] heaven like I dove and what it does like
[2:02:01] it does so it's flubbering down and
[2:02:04] evolved upon him
[2:02:06] a ball upon him if I went if you read it
[2:02:09] from 1 verse 32 verse 33 and I knew him
[2:02:13] not
[2:02:14] right
[2:02:15] but he that sent me to baptize with
[2:02:18] water
[2:02:21] which was the one that led him out of
[2:02:22] the Wilderness which was the Father
[2:02:24] which was Jehovah God or every however
[2:02:25] you want to say his name
[2:02:27] the same said unto me upon whom Thou
[2:02:30] shalt see the spirit descending and
[2:02:33] remaining on him there's no doubt he had
[2:02:37] been around maybe some of the Pharisees
[2:02:39] or maybe even countless he'd seen
[2:02:41] calculus and being a prophet he could
[2:02:43] see God was heading towards the temple
[2:02:45] and he'd see an anointing fall on him
[2:02:48] that's that's right amen
[2:02:50] but when confused come out he see that
[2:02:53] in the morning leaving
[2:02:55] he'd see those Pharisees you see
[2:02:57] anointing fall on them
[2:03:02] that's right right but God instructed
[2:03:04] the prophet
[2:03:06] he says whatever the ones you see
[2:03:07] whatever the one he didn't say a bunch
[2:03:10] he said one that's a bunch now but he
[2:03:12] said whoever you see the spirit
[2:03:14] descending and remaining on him the same
[2:03:18] as which baptizes with the Holy Ghost
[2:03:21] that's right amen
[2:03:24] so remember he didn't need the Holy
[2:03:26] Ghost that's right amen the Bible says
[2:03:30] his Spirit was a spirit sometimes the
[2:03:32] Bible comes back to the prophets brother
[2:03:34] Ron said in the holy spirit all right so
[2:03:36] so you know you believe whatever you
[2:03:38] want to about Jesus being a normal man
[2:03:40] over here and then being God over here
[2:03:41] be careful that's right all right you
[2:03:44] make him another person get making
[2:03:46] schizophrenic if he had two or three
[2:03:48] personalities inside of it that's right
[2:03:49] all right I just believe he was born
[2:03:51] Emmanuel God would amen that's enough
[2:03:54] for me what the Bible says all right he
[2:03:56] went Park God he called God that's what
[2:03:58] the president Ryan said all right I'll
[2:04:00] repeat him in he said we get it by
[2:04:02] measure
[2:04:03] he got it without measure all right amen
[2:04:06] so without measure means everything
[2:04:07] means a whole cup that's right all right
[2:04:10] all right but he didn't have a human
[2:04:11] side he didn't have a human flesh he
[2:04:13] didn't have a human brain that he had to
[2:04:15] live because he had to live like me and
[2:04:16] you had to be on touch
[2:04:20] do not remember
[2:04:22] we look and we see now I want you to
[2:04:25] kind of
[2:04:26] polish your brain up a little bit
[2:04:30] we know that the prophet of God told us
[2:04:32] that when Jesus stood and he said who do
[2:04:35] men say that I am
[2:04:37] right I'll tell you a lot so tell you
[2:04:39] this and tell you that
[2:04:41] so who do you think of it I'm asking you
[2:04:43] today what do you think this message is
[2:04:45] the Bible right right well I've heard
[2:04:47] tape or I've heard Brothers
[2:04:50] I want to know what you know about it
[2:04:53] I don't know what you say about
[2:04:55] it I want to know your experience if you
[2:04:58] don't have one you need to fight and get
[2:05:00] one that's right amen but God and spirit
[2:05:05] if I went to a conversation right amen
[2:05:08] but that Spirit came into human flesh on
[2:05:10] one one we've been reading it for 119th
[2:05:13] sirens in the beginning was the word
[2:05:16] with wood God and the Word was God and
[2:05:19] that word was made flesh
[2:05:22] how many of y'all thought about Jesus
[2:05:24] when I said that
[2:05:26] I know a lot of people did
[2:05:28] I think I mean amen
[2:05:32] the word has now become flesh right amen
[2:05:37] sure he did back there but that's our
[2:05:39] example right but right here today
[2:05:42] and the Word was made flesh and dwell
[2:05:45] Among Us the world is going to know just
[2:05:48] for the moment that God walked at a
[2:05:50] bunch of people on this Earth yes sir
[2:05:52] amen right just for a moment
[2:05:54] [Music]
[2:05:56] and listen if you're somewhere else just
[2:05:58] like my dad has always said if you want
[2:06:00] to take a train trip a trip on the train
[2:06:02] don't buy a ticket it's Airline down
[2:06:06] I've been at the wrong place at the
[2:06:08] wrong time but you got to take it well
[2:06:10] you got taken the wrong place right
[2:06:12] right place right time all right let's
[2:06:14] go son of man though the Son of God is
[2:06:17] the spirit of God right that's right the
[2:06:19] son of man though was the preacher he
[2:06:21] was the word made flesh he was the one
[2:06:23] they could hold on to they never
[2:06:26] understood that man never understood
[2:06:28] they knew they was there was parts of
[2:06:30] them they were saved that's something
[2:06:32] about you
[2:06:43] that's right that's right come Jesus
[2:06:46] asked him a question who do the house
[2:06:48] say I'm the son of Manning
[2:06:50] he didn't even answer the question
[2:06:51] because he didn't know the question
[2:06:52] that's right he just knew that was
[2:06:55] something about him
[2:06:56] yeah but on the day of Pentecost
[2:06:59] when that man came back into that group
[2:07:01] of people yeah yeah yes and I'm going to
[2:07:04] tell you something if you got the
[2:07:06] baptism of the Holy Ghost
[2:07:10] who wrote this
[2:07:13] the Holy Ghost wrote this good man
[2:07:15] that's right
[2:07:17] now if you open it
[2:07:21] it's the Holy Ghost read what the Holy
[2:07:23] Ghost wrote amen amen
[2:07:29] and if it's Christ
[2:07:31] if you've got the true baptismal logo
[2:07:33] you can't say something to me can't say
[2:07:35] something this this can't say something
[2:07:37] different
[2:07:38] got to say the same thing that's why the
[2:07:40] son of man Ministry had to come back at
[2:07:42] the end time under the Son of God
[2:07:44] Ministry listen just for a few minutes
[2:07:46] under the son of God's Ministry Luther
[2:07:48] could preach
[2:07:51] trinitarianism
[2:07:53] Holy Ghost God went to the dignity
[2:07:55] because he didn't that wasn't the time
[2:07:57] that wasn't the anointing for that
[2:07:59] moment that's right right John Wesley
[2:08:01] the same way
[2:08:02] he could appreciate trinitarian Doctrine
[2:08:04] and God would say oh that's okay I just
[2:08:06] want you to do this I want you to get my
[2:08:08] people sanctified
[2:08:10] amen come to the Pentecostals I want you
[2:08:12] to be able to to uh expound from the
[2:08:15] gifts I want you to be able to use the
[2:08:16] gift because I'm going to say the
[2:08:17] prophet
[2:08:18] see if God would have sent a prophet and
[2:08:20] Luther's a our Prophet people will be
[2:08:22] going like whoa this is fanatical but he
[2:08:25] said well the random writing Pentecostal
[2:08:27] time we just stepped right in he
[2:08:30] believed in tongues he believed in
[2:08:31] interpretations he believed in healing
[2:08:33] so it was just God
[2:08:35] stepping right up the line amen one of
[2:08:38] those Pentecostals right where they
[2:08:40] needed to be getting them anointing of
[2:08:42] the baptism of the Holy Ghost that's
[2:08:43] right the truth was speaking in tongues
[2:08:46] and the truth even even when it fell
[2:08:48] under that Pentecost it fell on
[2:08:49] trinitarians
[2:08:51] they didn't have it all right that's
[2:08:53] right but they had some things right but
[2:08:55] then you come up with the one in this
[2:08:56] group then you got brother Adam teaching
[2:08:57] what going back and teaching us what
[2:09:00] Paul said right
[2:09:04] so we look and see they're going to
[2:09:07] write them
[2:09:08] he comes in
[2:09:10] he preaches his messaging
[2:09:12] he tells the people
[2:09:16] well I don't understand you're not
[2:09:18] getting it but remember in the 13th book
[2:09:20] brother I said this messenger Malachi 4
[2:09:22] has come to do two things yes amen I can
[2:09:26] quote it without even looking at it amen
[2:09:28] amen right first to turn the hearts of
[2:09:31] the children
[2:09:33] back children family babies Pentecostal
[2:09:36] babies
[2:09:37] back to the face of the father yes
[2:09:40] right back to water baptism correct back
[2:09:43] to where there's no eternal hell back
[2:09:44] before there's not
[2:09:51] but you see what it was it was he was
[2:09:53] bringing us back to that right but then
[2:09:56] he said it was going to do two things
[2:09:57] yes amen the second one
[2:10:01] is remember the book was closed back in
[2:10:05] about 80 30 or 80 20 something Jesus
[2:10:08] close the foot right I read to the
[2:10:11] scripture he closed the club handed it
[2:10:13] back to the preacher right
[2:10:15] now
[2:10:18] Revelation 10 7.
[2:10:21] they say man putting the book open again
[2:10:25] and precious words 1100 determine
[2:10:29] proceeded out of his mind amen amen and
[2:10:32] now we're working this day
[2:10:35] description all right
[2:10:37] right amen
[2:10:40] not a day 24-hour day remember remember
[2:10:42] thank God for a prophet one more time to
[2:10:44] everybody
[2:10:45] you want to make sure y'all ain't left
[2:10:47] until somebody else come back in
[2:10:49] but you look and see that John was in
[2:10:53] the spirit on the Lord's day brother
[2:10:54] said that wasn't a 24-hour day
[2:10:57] when I say Lord bless this day I mean
[2:10:59] the day of the Bride knock your 24-hour
[2:11:03] day the day of the Bride the day when
[2:11:05] we're supposed to manifest not just the
[2:11:07] Son of God but the son of man amen we're
[2:11:10] to be the preacher amen
[2:11:25] but don't we believe the promising amen
[2:11:28] praise
[2:11:30] Revelation 5 said we did yes sir all
[2:11:33] right made us Kings and Priests amen so
[2:11:36] somebody hate amen praise God can you
[2:11:39] read this real quick little close on
[2:11:40] here
[2:11:41] Brothers 1955 Jesus had the greatest
[2:11:44] anointing of any man now listen that
[2:11:46] great anointing was on him to preach the
[2:11:49] gospel right
[2:11:50] what came on him at the River Jordan was
[2:11:53] an anointing for a Ministry of three and
[2:11:56] a half years because that's why what's
[2:11:59] happening now we're under the son of man
[2:12:01] Ministry so we're getting that same
[2:12:03] three and a half year message that Jesus
[2:12:06] preached
[2:12:09] but now remember there was a time that
[2:12:12] that anointing came off of Jesus
[2:12:16] yes sir amen Jesus had the greatest
[2:12:19] anoint of any man ever on earth is that
[2:12:21] right one day he went into the temple
[2:12:22] they gave him the scroll if he picked it
[2:12:24] up he sat down and read Isaiah where it
[2:12:26] said the spirit of the Lord is upon me
[2:12:27] to preach the acceptable year and so
[2:12:29] forth brother I'm talking the Jubilee
[2:12:31] year yeah let me put that in there
[2:12:33] that's right and he took the swallow and
[2:12:35] handed it back and sat down and pressed
[2:12:37] his words received from his mouth the
[2:12:38] greatest anointed it was ever on here
[2:12:41] oh man man all back to this work no ways
[2:12:45] ain't anointing all right I'm gonna read
[2:12:48] that one more time yes oh sometimes we
[2:12:50] meant to this get noise confused with an
[2:12:53] awning amen well you couldn't get him at
[2:12:56] this shout out the matter right no no no
[2:12:59] you're wrong about that nobody's ain't
[2:13:02] anointed no no I've seen a lot of noise
[2:13:06] and not faith enough to cure toothache
[2:13:09] you've got to come silently to the
[2:13:11] father you've got to know exactly where
[2:13:13] you stand right Amen brother why am I
[2:13:17] picking people so talked about 1956
[2:13:20] some people get the wrong impression of
[2:13:22] what the anointing is did you ever think
[2:13:24] of that what was the greatest anointing
[2:13:26] that ever was to anyone what did they do
[2:13:29] when they had the anointed
[2:13:32] the greatest anointing that was ever
[2:13:34] given to anyone was Jesus Christ we have
[2:13:37] the spirit by measure he had it without
[2:13:40] measurement right all right and one day
[2:13:42] here and into the temple and you pick up
[2:13:44] the scroll and he read the spirit of God
[2:13:45] is upon me for he has anointed me to
[2:13:47] preach the acceptable year buying up the
[2:13:49] broken heart heal the sick give us out
[2:13:51] to the wife now we would think if such
[2:13:53] anointing was on him there had been
[2:13:55] prophesied 800 years before that it
[2:13:58] would come and here he was with that
[2:14:00] type of anointing the full blessing and
[2:14:03] anointing of the Lord upon him that we
[2:14:05] would want to run all over the building
[2:14:06] screaming and hollering but the Bible
[2:14:09] said he put the scroll down sit down
[2:14:14] all right
[2:14:16] here's the thing
[2:14:17] that's what he done under that point
[2:14:21] the anointing is not emotion that's
[2:14:23] right the anointing is supreme power
[2:14:28] amen yes now he gave us a comma
[2:14:34] like knowing exactly what and how it is
[2:14:38] Amen period amen sir amen
[2:14:44] thank you
[2:14:45] and that looks well real quick I think
[2:14:47] 65 rocking the sun brother I
[2:14:49] intelligence we know the Spirit came on
[2:14:52] him
[2:14:53] on the rip Jordan yes minority for a
[2:14:56] Ministry which was a Ministry of the son
[2:14:59] of man

[2:15:06] they got all the Falcons out of it but
[2:15:08] he preached all through God yes sir all
[2:15:10] right if I win so now look 1965. I
[2:15:13] noticed this quickening power zodium

[2:15:18] mind that was in Christ was in you then

[2:15:56] on the inside
[2:15:59] and also equipping to life with him you
[2:16:03] are now quickened to life although when
[2:16:06] you were but an attribute in this boss
[2:16:08] but God saw all in him at the finish so
[2:16:12] now he's saying at the Finish yes it's
[2:16:15] not the thing amen okay it's an
[2:16:18] advantage
[2:16:19] what are you talking about us now yeah

[2:17:20] God anointed that flesh which was human
[2:17:23] flesh
[2:17:24] if Peter went up there as God he'd have
[2:17:27] never died that time that kind of death
[2:17:28] can't kill God that's right but he

[2:25:52] certainly thank you brother when I'm
[2:25:53] going to try to preach behind you it's
[2:25:55] the same word the same Holy Ghost yeah
[2:25:58] same Holy Ghost yes sir when we see
[2:26:01] these things that were spoken today and
[2:26:04] have watched the word grow in our lives
[2:26:16] and that word as we see
[2:26:19] have come to the Capstone and we've been
[2:26:22] speaking on the Perfection of the garage
[2:26:25] and that's let me just quote this
[2:26:28] because I love it and the message there
[2:26:31] invisible Union of the pride wrote
[2:26:33] around and said that same Holy Ghost the
[2:26:36] quickening power that Jesus was all the
[2:26:38] quickening now right he said that same
[2:26:41] quickly power that raised up Jesus when
[2:26:44] he raised up Jesus he hath already
[2:26:47] raised you up with him and seated you
[2:26:51] and I have moved places and in Christ
[2:26:53] Jesus so we're only catching up to what
[2:26:56] he has already made us
[2:27:01] thank you for that
[2:27:06] [Applause]

[2:27:18] we want to leave with that word
[2:27:19] resonating
[2:27:21] with who you are right especially in
[2:27:24] this hour Satan has so marred the
[2:27:27] identification of people they don't know
[2:27:29] who they are what they are and why
[2:27:31] they're here what's their purpose and
[2:27:34] our precious Brothers speaking on that
[2:27:35] anointing with purpose how thankful we
[2:27:38] are that the purpose of God afford
[2:27:41] knowledge of God that operates in our
[2:27:43] lives bringing us to a reality that
[2:27:46] we're not two brothers or they'll make
[2:27:48] them two every time but it's Christ in
[2:27:51] you the whole thing yeah okay so by the
[2:27:53] way we really appreciate that that's
[2:27:55] good
[2:27:59] thank you
[2:28:02] really surrendering to the Lord and
[2:28:04] speaking those great words of truth
[2:28:07] these words has transforming us into his
[2:28:10] image that we're not looking for another
[2:28:12] person or another man but the word the
[2:28:15] Christ that's in you is the Apostle Paul
[2:28:18] speaking to the Hebrews he tried to get
[2:28:21] them to see the great Perfection that
[2:28:23] moved from Judaism and he talks about
[2:28:26] Jesus Christ he said how Moses built his
[2:28:29] house and Christ built his house whose
[2:28:32] house were you but then he goes on to
[2:28:34] the ministry of Manchester that and he
[2:28:36] begins to talk about the Perfection of
[2:28:38] who you are and so when we see as
[2:28:41] brother Wade ministered today showing us
[2:28:44] the great anointing that came upon the
[2:28:48] Lord it did not come and go it did not
[2:28:51] come and go the brother opened our eyes
[2:28:53] to the different anointings the Old
[2:28:55] Testament anointing the false anointing
[2:28:57] but the anointed broad
[2:29:00] that you are that's I'm coming and going
[2:29:03] that's not flipping the switch on and
[2:29:05] off that's not something dollar of God
[2:29:07] one day and night we're thankful we've
[2:29:10] recognized who we are and we're thankful
[2:29:12] that this day this scripture is

[2:30:23] about the lead but we've been praying
[2:30:26] for weeks and months for this time and
[2:30:30] so we don't want to let this light water
[2:30:32] off our ducks back we're going to hold
[2:30:34] to that word brother Joel Brown came and
[2:30:36] poured out his soul last night and
[2:30:39] encouraged all of us spoke to all of us
[2:30:41] and we heard that word even we have some
[2:30:44] I wouldn't dare mention that went home
[2:30:47] families that went home last night
[2:30:49] pray for their parents again pray for
[2:30:51] these to me and pray for brother away
[2:30:54] David tell them we're praying for
[2:30:55] brother away I thought I wouldn't care
[2:30:57] to this lovely family family is and I I
[2:31:02] thank God that's the kind of caliber we
[2:31:04] have with these Believers community and
[2:31:07] so when we see that and and seeing uh
[2:31:10] precious brother Louise and his
[2:31:12] wonderful minister in the family that he
[2:31:14] has and brother Aaron here brother Bob
[2:31:17] went back last night uh you know the
[2:31:20] brother away these wonderful ministers
[2:31:24] have come up and been a great blessing
[2:31:26] to the church here you know oh with open
[2:31:30] arms and the Believers or so they're
[2:31:34] feeding you know as a as a minister when
[2:31:36] you see your people feeding on the word
[2:31:38] and not not just a bunch of nonsense but
[2:31:42] really feeding on the Subscribe and when
[2:31:46] we have these kind of Ministries that
[2:31:48] y'all have sent up it's just has been a
[2:31:51] fair and fair you know it's the hand of
[2:31:54] God let me say this real quick and then
[2:31:56] we'll prepare to leaving us and I you
[2:32:00] know you you as a minister
[2:32:04] and that's a Believer you you watch the
[2:32:07] hand of God in your life
[2:32:10] you watch that
[2:32:12] and then just however God deals with you
[2:32:16] been a Christian about 30 years and for
[2:32:19] me to just wake up to I don't know how
[2:32:21] God deals I don't know how you can
[2:32:22] please come on I mean I know something
[2:32:24] about being a Christian you know it's a
[2:32:27] shame like you said this morning it's a
[2:32:29] shame when we come to church and we
[2:32:31] don't grow anymore it's a shame when
[2:32:33] we've been reading from second Peter 3
[2:32:35] 18 where Peter says grow in the grace
[2:32:38] and the knowledge as Jesus did right and
[2:32:41] so we're coming to church but we're you
[2:32:44] know two months later we hadn't learned
[2:32:47] we hadn't received when Jesus said come
[2:32:49] unto me and learn with me like that
[2:32:52] that's just words coming to me and learn
[2:32:55] that thing and so you know just like you
[2:32:58] brother Wayne just like you ministers we
[2:33:00] challenge these Believers because this
[2:33:03] is who they are this is what they are
[2:33:05] and that's the purpose and anointing and
[2:33:08] so you know when when we saw the Lord
[2:33:12] began to move and when brother Aaron
[2:33:15] coming up the living his cell and then
[2:33:18] wrote Bob and brother Louise
[2:33:22] and then I began to watch because I
[2:33:24] don't just have anyone come up to this
[2:33:26] pool driveway I'm beginning to watch
[2:33:28] that and I thought Lord are you doing
[2:33:31] something
[2:33:32] not just having another minister in it
[2:33:35] or we love those things we love those
[2:33:37] things God has a powerful Ministry
[2:33:40] and so I began to see the hand of the
[2:33:43] Lord move and so when brother Bob and
[2:33:46] Brother Joseph was here the last time I
[2:33:49] stood behind this Pulpit we had a
[2:33:51] wonderful time of Fellowship the word
[2:33:53] went forward am I doing and I said you
[2:33:57] know
[2:33:58] you all will you'll have to go and bring
[2:34:01] your young people and bring people up
[2:34:03] from Louisville and so you know I I was
[2:34:08] catching the vision I wasn't catching in
[2:34:11] what God was doing
[2:34:13] and the brothers came to her brother
[2:34:14] Louise different ones came through and
[2:34:17] then so many weeks later I was speaking
[2:34:21] with brother Wayne
[2:34:23] he said hey you know let's be praying
[2:34:27] about this
[2:34:28] then I I realized
[2:34:30] that the vision that brother Wade had
[2:34:33] he'd actually had outreached me
[2:34:37] because I was looking for this too but
[2:34:40] his vision
[2:34:42] outreached me when he said we'll bring
[2:34:45] the group up and I thought right then oh
[2:34:48] God this is your ability
[2:34:52] my vision like I woke up just here
[2:34:55] brother Wade's mentioned it out reached
[2:34:58] mine
[2:34:59] God bringing these things together
[2:35:01] and so how thankful we are it's not
[2:35:05] about a man that's broken in the weeks
[2:35:07] to the seals this hasn't been a man
[2:35:11] and this hasn't been a name right and I
[2:35:15] can say what you want to but be careful
[2:35:17] yeah what you say yeah there's a hasn't
[2:35:20] been a man that's been y'all
[2:35:23] and so all of your lives your families
[2:35:26] your children your anticipation has been
[2:35:29] precious and these things have been in
[2:35:32] the fellowship of Brotherly kindness and
[2:35:34] the agape love
[2:35:37] and so we appreciate them I'm not good
[2:35:40] at these things but we're gonna ask your
[2:35:43] brother Wayne to come back and uh or
[2:35:46] revolution on here now
[2:35:49] and what we're going to do we're going
