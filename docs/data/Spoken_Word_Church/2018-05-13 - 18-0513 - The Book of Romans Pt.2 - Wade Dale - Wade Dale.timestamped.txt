[0:00] here we go all right now last time I was
[0:05] hunting for last we have a real good
[0:08] time in Arizona that with some super
[0:11] duper trip but Chris they tell about
[0:12] hello and you'll be out here sometime in
[0:17] July just a visit not great for just a
[0:19] visitor
[0:20] well let me tell you on Sunday come home
[0:23] from Savannah God was really with us
[0:25] because I'm showing that tractor trailer
[0:27] behind us slam on the brakes and smoke
[0:29] coming out from under and he comes right
[0:32] up beside us that was moving to the left
[0:35] he was moving reckless people were going
[0:37] well all over him did stop dead stop hmm
[0:41] and we were very friend for that anyways
[0:46] yes 65 mile an hour just know
[0:49] well God took care of us like a king
[0:51] amen all right okay that's the angels
[1:02] job all right now we're coming up the
[1:04] book of Romans and we began you can go
[1:07] back a couple of weeks ago any and we
[1:09] just kind of set a stage or what the
[1:13] book of Romans was about Paul had not
[1:16] been to Rome yet but he was going to
[1:19] Rome later on but there was things that
[1:21] were already in Rome so he was talking
[1:23] to them you got to remember some of
[1:25] these letters Marv to either where he
[1:28] had been or where he was going he was
[1:31] admonishing the people that were there
[1:32] that they kept the faith if it was your
[1:36] faith is pumping throughout the whole
[1:37] world in a book Romans but now you got
[1:40] to remember to what happened in Rome
[1:41] Rome was the seat of the Roman Catholic
[1:45] Church they had not started the Roman
[1:48] Catholic Church at that time but it
[1:49] deceives were being planted for Rome
[1:52] Italy to be the seat of the Roman
[1:55] Catholic Church which I breath around
[1:58] said it had to come from a part of like
[2:00] we're doing it that's why I said it you
[2:02] can see the seals in these writings they
[2:05] didn't see it but we can see that
[2:09] with true church in Rome but there was
[2:12] also a false church that was coming up
[2:14] out of room because nastya the nice teen
[2:16] Council it's where they all met and the
[2:19] wrong the people from Rome Rome had
[2:21] physically comforted the world at this
[2:23] time Rome was built in Jerusalem because
[2:27] remember times comes in an 87 team
[2:29] destroying it well this is the 80 60
[2:30] listen before he even gets there alright
[2:33] so but there's a group of people Brian
[2:38] that is there that Paul needs did - Paul
[2:43] needs to talk to him but now remember
[2:45] this book this whole book is written to
[2:49] Christians but it has multi levels he
[2:53] was writing to the Romans but you and I
[2:55] can clean what we get out of it in this
[2:58] time that's not old writings sure it's a
[3:02] couple thousand years old but it's not
[3:05] old
[3:05] it's the Eternal Word of God God thought
[3:07] so much oh but he put it in the Bible
[3:10] and it was written by Paul notes written
[3:14] by Paul that was letters to the Romans
[3:18] alright and now remember - as we read I
[3:21] want you to help me read this but I want
[3:24] to 1 we talked about something called
[3:27] interpolating and Paul is they he is a
[3:31] master interpolator now what happens is
[3:34] it's like brother branham you remember
[3:36] when the Holy Spirit told brother Brown
[3:38] pick up his pen and Ronald
[3:40] burger is gonna see well see that was
[3:42] what the Holy Spirit said now brother
[3:45] Branham preached a sermon he
[3:46] interpolated all the different things
[3:48] before he read that note he interpolated
[3:52] the whole sermon of his spoken words
[3:54] reason see all right but no but what God
[3:57] wrote was what God wrote he said pick up
[4:00] your pen and write so he was writing
[4:02] what God said the same thing with Paul
[4:05] because Paul he talks to not anybody
[4:11] here right now but once we get closer he
[4:12] starts calling names please right - yeah
[4:15] I'm gonna write the sister Johnny
[4:16] mr. Johnny I hope there were things fine
[4:18] we'll see that's Paul but he's putting
[4:21] in the Word of God not his chapters
[4:24] reverses all right remember these are
[4:26] the letters there's no chapters of
[4:27] emergencies when Paul was writing this
[4:28] man put those chapters and verses in
[4:31] when King James describes started
[4:33] Clinton to Bible together but watch what
[4:37] Paul is in and how you how interpolating
[4:39] works is is that you make the you make a
[4:42] statement and then the comments that you
[4:46] have sometimes when we're preaching if
[4:49] you were to write it now my brother Dale
[4:50] many times if we were going to do the
[4:52] sermon in eighty two of the seals he'll
[4:55] read what brother Brown says he'll read
[4:57] the Bible and then he'll interpolate now
[5:00] maybe thirty minutes for us as ministers
[5:03] because we're interpolating we're not
[5:05] interpreting right re interpolating
[5:08] which means we are inserting something
[5:12] in there to tell you what it means now
[5:15] sometimes I was thinking this morning
[5:18] sometimes we're wrong preachers are
[5:21] wrong but God's not wrong then when when
[5:24] Paul was writing this you might know one
[5:26] thing for sure whatever is in
[5:28] parentheses sure it was Paul's thought
[5:30] but that thought came through the Holy
[5:32] Ghost for me and you to be able to
[5:35] understand or interpret it better then
[5:38] we got that okay so now let's read Paul
[5:42] a servant of Jesus Christ called to be
[5:45] an apostle separated into the gospel of
[5:48] God now look he just right there he's
[5:51] interpolated because watch this is what
[5:53] it should have said Paul the servant of
[5:55] Jesus Christ called to be an apostle
[5:56] separate into the gospel of God
[5:58] concerning his son Jesus Christ our Lord
[6:00] well see you wouldn't get the whole
[6:01] meaning of that in the end interpolated
[6:03] in verse two anywhere you see
[6:06] parentheses that is an interpolation or
[6:08] he is interpreting okay he is
[6:11] interpreting because it's the Holy Ghost
[6:13] through him you and I can do that and be
[6:15] wrong he can't be wrong doing this to me
[6:18] this is the Holy Spirit stopping Paul
[6:21] and saying okay Paul you need to insert
[6:24] this right here now it may not happen he
[6:27] may have just got the thought but
[6:28] remember if he's writing the Bible then
[6:30] that salt was from God it wasn't his
[6:32] talk so he says look Paul a servant of
[6:35] Jesus Christ called been Apostles have
[6:36] read into the gospel of God which he had
[6:39] promised afore by his prophets in the
[6:41] Holy Scripture so what he did he took
[6:43] them back to the Old Testament that's
[6:46] correct
[6:47] he's these time the spirit of the games
[6:48] going instead he's going all the way
[6:50] back because remember there is no Holy
[6:52] Scripture that Paul's looking at except
[6:57] right here from here to here this has
[7:04] not been written yet this is the New
[7:06] Testament so you know I come back to
[7:08] Holy Scriptures he is riding Holy
[7:10] Scripture I don't know that he knows
[7:12] that at that time but he is riding Holy
[7:14] Scripture okay all right so what is
[7:17] saying which he had promised afore by
[7:18] his prophets in the Holy Scripture what
[7:22] separated people call of God to be
[7:25] impossible all right concerning his son
[7:28] Jesus Christ our Lord which was made of
[7:30] the seed of David according to the flesh
[7:34] all right remember no watch and declared
[7:39] to be the Son of God with power
[7:40] according to the spirit of holiness by
[7:43] the resurrection from the dead that's
[7:45] what concluded the whole thing right by
[7:48] whom we have received Grace and
[7:50] Apostleship for obedience to the faith
[7:54] among all nations for his name among
[7:57] whom are ye now chief when they said
[7:59] that ye it comes all the way to this day
[8:01] and we're just the people he was riding
[8:03] Rome and it was he yeah you right okay
[8:07] cuz remember you got to make this
[8:09] personal he's writing to the Romans but
[8:11] he's writing to menu this is one of the
[8:13] longest letters Paul ever rose so
[8:16] there's something in here and it's right
[8:18] after the book of Acts like I said it
[8:19] was possessed
[8:20] we please right out of the book of Acts
[8:24] so there must be something significant
[8:26] about reading this this longest letter
[8:30] from Romans come it really it's not
[8:33] chronologically it's not in the right
[8:35] order because he wrote Corinthians and
[8:38] maybe 59 he wrote different ones in 1856
[8:40] but this is a B sixties writing the
[8:43] Romans God through those scholars put
[8:48] this Robert suppose to bei don't
[8:50] remember the other teens brown weren't
[8:51] supposed to be the property garden
[8:52] vindicated it it's right where it's
[8:54] supposed to be all right
[8:55] so this book of Romans is very important
[8:57] to flap like I said last thing there's
[9:00] three things but if you want to write
[9:03] these down you can all right
[9:07] justification is let's do everything let
[9:13] me let me get it to Cusco Scofield got I
[9:18] love this footnote something you can you
[9:21] can take it if you want to certain
[9:22] things you can take that's fine but it
[9:25] hasn't an introduction it's in seven
[9:27] parts the whole world is guilty before
[9:29] God 118 through 322 there's
[9:37] justification through the righteousness
[9:38] of God by faith the gospel remedy for
[9:40] guilt which is chapter 3 through chapter
[9:43] 5 the third ones that crucifix and with
[9:46] Christ the resurrection of life and
[9:49] walking in the spirit is chapter five
[9:51] through eight number four is the full
[9:55] results of the blessing of the gospel
[9:56] chapter 8 through 14 5 is paranthesis
[10:03] the gospel does not abolish to cover the
[10:06] promise to Israel chapter nine through
[10:08] eleven and then number six is Christian
[10:13] life and service chapter 12 to 15 and
[10:16] then 7 is the outflow of Christian love
[10:19] chapter sixteen one through twenty seven
[10:23] so it's the sixteenth chapter and we'll
[10:25] get into that but I want you to I've
[10:28] always been the kind of guy that just
[10:29] you just don't read it I don't need a
[10:31] little background give me something why
[10:32] is Paul saying what he's saying while
[10:35] he's saying it right here why is he
[10:36] saying so this will kind of give you the
[10:39] reason that I believe God put it right
[10:41] after the book last of the book of Acts
[10:43] you've got tender people they have the
[10:45] Holy Ghost and then he knows that you
[10:48] and I are gonna read this right after
[10:50] the book of Acts if we're gonna read it
[10:51] in order then we're gonna read this book
[10:53] of Romans because it caused my
[10:54] justification sanctification and the
[10:56] baptism of Holy Ghost all right so to me
[10:58] that's everything you need
[11:01] there's no one there was oh sure this
[11:06] plan that I had but once you get that
[11:07] then it's God adding to God that sounds
[11:14] strange but it is it's God adding to go
[11:16] okay now verse 3 concerning his son
[11:22] Jesus Christ our Lord which was made of
[11:25] the seed of David according to the flesh
[11:26] and declared to be the Son of God with
[11:29] power according to the spirit of
[11:31] holiness by the resurrection from the
[11:33] dead
[11:33] by whom we have received Grace and
[11:36] Apostleship what Paul did Paul saying
[11:38] he's transferred whatever he resurrected
[11:41] he transferred it to us
[11:42] so that's what he's doing by the
[11:45] resurrection from the dead reading light
[11:46] all that Paul is writing it to you so
[11:50] you need to you need to compartmentalize
[11:55] this Paul is speaking to you there was a
[11:58] resurrection of Jesus Christ now what's
[12:02] it for he's telling you by them we have
[12:06] received Grace and Apostleship for
[12:09] obedience to the faith among all things
[12:12] now see their obedience to the faith
[12:15] we're going to talk about that a little
[12:17] bit maybe this afternoon about
[12:20] justification remember is not something
[12:22] you can do you can't justify yourself
[12:24] right God has to be the justified but
[12:27] you can walk through sanctification and
[12:29] stop at different places or you can
[12:31] become fully sanctified okay so that's
[12:33] your claim program we're going to quote
[12:37] we run around city that you're not saved
[12:40] by the blade
[12:41] you're staying pilot you have pounds and
[12:44] pounds of blood and do you know good
[12:46] you're saved by the life that was into
[12:48] blood but because the life and the blood
[12:50] were connected then why can wash away my
[12:53] sins nothing but the blood of Jesus but
[12:56] we know as Christians it's not the
[12:59] literal blood because some came through
[13:01] the literal blood honey if I could know
[13:04] you could be you could drown in the
[13:06] blood of Jesus Christ and die go to hell
[13:09] literally but if you got the life of the
[13:13] man so what does the blood day the blood
[13:15] sanctifies it just keeps you watched
[13:17] because remember in the Old Testament if
[13:20] we may get to it this afternoon the Old
[13:21] Testament they sprinkled seven times
[13:29] they would sprinkle the the blood when
[13:32] you got to the children of Israel they
[13:34] put the blood over the door closed now
[13:36] lit up it didn't say to five young
[13:39] people in there because that was a boil
[13:43] animal but it was a type that when the
[13:46] Death Angel came by he said okay they
[13:48] did what you told them to do God's
[13:50] running amok but now that token is not
[13:54] just over the door it waltz in
[13:57] Walmart he walks in targeted walks to
[13:59] the gas station it walks in you're out
[14:01] okay
[14:02] it's listen it's good to apply the token
[14:05] right that's okay but I can apply with
[14:08] token to my children and they don't help
[14:13] but once that token goes in them that's
[14:16] why we pray that our kids get the new
[14:18] birth that our family gets the new birth
[14:21] you know what they take their chance
[14:23] into my throne but I'd rather them be
[14:25] born again blood on the doorpost don't
[14:31] do you any good now yes it's the blood
[14:34] they keeps you sanctified but at last
[14:36] was what one inside of you and then what
[14:39] you are the token
[14:42] see that's what seals reveal the silver
[14:45] building you are the token yeah
[14:48] well huh well okay then being
[14:50] unbelievable I can't like old beekeeper
[14:56] told me said they spring things that
[14:57] will kill you damn good in the wooden
[15:04] any bride cuz what just can't dude can't
[15:08] push it just adore this hey couldn't
[15:10] shut the door okay I wouldn't suck you
[15:13] know okay
[15:15] so can't couldn't and wouldn't those are
[15:17] three friends that you don't want in
[15:18] your house alright so remember that
[15:21] maybe that's a little something you take
[15:23] home I can't when you say I can that
[15:25] means you just you have you have you
[15:27] just I can't do that I can take a body
[15:31] change wine why don't you tell me one
[15:35] your body's already changed according to
[15:38] the Bible so Julian's justified he's
[15:40] already glorified Amen that's right
[15:50] well see you got to look at Paul Paul
[15:52] but see now watch Paul Paul knew he
[15:55] wasn't going tango buddy chain
[15:57] yes paper it was revealed to him and
[16:01] we'll read it later oh maybe hold
[16:02] further where he says we're brother
[16:04] Browne said Paul was trying to get them
[16:05] people out of there get it out of their
[16:07] head that Christ was coming right then
[16:08] sorry cuz Paul knew as a prophet Tom
[16:12] could see Paul could see into this into
[16:15] this age and he knew that they weren't
[16:17] gonna have a rapture in the in the first
[16:21] church age that was just the beginning
[16:22] of the church faith alright so but
[16:26] that's why the Bible is is that onion
[16:28] peel you just keep peeling back you can
[16:30] you can take the sanctification that
[16:33] will clean you and set you aside like I
[16:35] told you a couple seconds ago you know
[16:37] when Zach was what I was using that
[16:38] black you know the unclean spirit goes
[16:40] out all right but now remember remember
[16:45] one thing's for sure when you take
[16:47] sanctification in the level we're
[16:48] talking about the seals it's not to take
[16:50] own answers attached to your soul that
[16:53] old nature's data
[16:54] it's just that Adamic nature that's in
[16:57] this realm that even Jesus was attacked
[17:00] by in his spirit okay so we are attacked
[17:05] in the spirit realm I they kind of
[17:08] looked at me a little cross-eyed in
[17:09] Arizona the other day when I told them I
[17:11] said you flex don't sin it doesn't your
[17:16] flesh is born in sin and it's getting
[17:19] older because of the fall but your flesh
[17:22] should never stand today in its life
[17:23] that's where we got to realize because I
[17:26] told them and when I gave them the
[17:27] scripture which I haven't given here
[17:29] even or just kind of showed it to me
[17:31] when I drill that Scripture but brother
[17:33] Brown sin smoking gambling running
[17:36] around custon he named up he said that
[17:38] is what not sin that's what you do in
[17:41] your body with your body he said what is
[17:44] sin now you don't want to believe with
[17:46] this
[17:48] this has really this has no unbelieving
[17:51] it's the product of unbelief but this
[17:55] has no belief in what is it unbelief is
[17:57] if you're born again it's not your so
[17:59] let's squeeze it down to that spirit
[18:01] room that's where your unbelief is don't
[18:04] have money right see that woman see what
[18:07] she did she was taught that this did
[18:09] everything but remember the same hand
[18:12] that some of us if we're out in the
[18:14] world you know I can hold a beer with
[18:15] this hand and and and do other things
[18:18] and do awful things with my hands I
[18:21] still got the same hands yes but what
[18:25] changed the best one inside that's bad
[18:28] that's what changed one inside and I
[18:30] want to do a little something brother
[18:32] Chris and I were talking like this it's
[18:33] a little bit off the sub D but it's not
[18:34] the because he's telling that
[18:36] resurrection but the Bible says if you
[18:38] serve the tabernacle word is off now see
[18:41] how I'm a part of that I'm not dying I'm
[18:46] not dying
[18:47] if this earthly Tabernacle were
[18:49] dissolved now what is your body your
[18:53] body as a capsule that holds you
[18:56] together I read a quote just this more
[18:58] brother Brown said your bones your
[19:00] flashing your blood is what holds
[19:02] everything together on the outside what
[19:06] do you do when you have a pill that's a
[19:10] capsule that you put in your body what
[19:12] does it do it dissolves so that what's
[19:16] on the inside does you good it's man all
[19:19] right so you're tired when I the word is
[19:22] all been put in the ground what's gonna
[19:25] do you good it's what's inside that
[19:26] capsule okay then you'll reach down and
[19:29] pick that capsule up we know that anyway
[19:31] let's go through this whenever we get we
[19:33] will never get any part of the book much
[19:36] okay yes all right we're good
[19:39] if you don't you're not liking this let
[19:41] me know okay uh hmm
[19:44] among whom are you also the called of
[19:47] Jesus Christ that's us believers listen
[19:51] we've got to believe I told them out
[19:53] there Oh Samuel I believe other mean
[19:55] Creek we gotta believe something that's
[19:57] really never happened cuz now you know
[20:02] we don't know what happened to him he's
[20:04] somewhere but there is a group of people
[20:06] that it's not going and even Jesus had
[20:08] to go to a grave everybody that's born
[20:14] of a woman is David whether we're alive
[20:19] or not
[20:20] but something's got to change that we
[20:21] were not that week which we which are
[20:26] alive and remain that's what we got to
[20:27] that's what we got we which are alive
[20:29] and remain then they coming in Ward we
[20:31] got to shift ourselves into that group
[20:33] but the problem is as we go look you too
[20:36] many graveyards you know we look back
[20:40] well sister Thrones over you know
[20:43] [Music]
[20:45] right here the woman our mind is our
[20:48] greatest problem and it's not your flesh
[20:53] brain your flesh brain is just like this
[20:57] right here there's nothing wrong with it
[20:59] until you put in what
[21:00] what you put in all right okay so now
[21:05] it's what Paul is trying to tell them
[21:06] let's see what you and I have to glean
[21:08] out of this is this since the 1500
[21:11] people have read this and I give them
[21:15] say sanctified filled with the Holy
[21:17] Ghost okay
[21:18] live a good life that's what brother
[21:19] Branham was saying in them and questions
[21:24] answers on the seals he said go long as
[21:26] you are this is not for you live a good
[21:28] Christian life he wasn't calling him not
[21:30] Christians he just said the right
[21:32] crystal and it's not here to receive
[21:36] when I'm preaching another word well I
[21:38] believe that the rock crystals here amen
[21:42] I mean we're just did one of the people
[21:44] he was talking to okay not saying they
[21:47] were all walks no live a good Christian
[21:49] life you were saved sanctified filled
[21:50] with the Holy Ghost you've done all you
[21:52] supposed to do in your age but when the
[21:55] seals open brethren saw that there was a
[21:58] group of people that was going to do
[22:00] more than just believe because they were
[22:02] believing on to their advice believing
[22:04] on - right now we're believing unto a
[22:06] resurrection we ought to believe into
[22:08] the change
[22:10] okay all right so read the scripture
[22:16] with a little understanding okay what do
[22:19] all the band Lulla
[22:24] all the man Loula Georgia beloved of God
[22:32] called to be Saints grace to you Paul
[22:36] dropping in and peace from God our
[22:38] Father and the Lord Jesus Christ now
[22:41] remember as we always save this let me
[22:43] give you these little corners as we go
[22:45] along polls not a trinitarian so what's
[22:48] Paul saying peace from God our Father
[22:49] and the Lord Jesus Christ if you take
[22:52] that by English that's separating and
[22:56] bringing new chthonian but that word
[22:59] hand if you'll look it up in your lungs
[23:01] and your concordance is that hand is
[23:03] interpreted as even brother they all
[23:06] said it many times for many years
[23:07] so what from God our Father even the
[23:10] Lord Jesus Christ what he's doing is is
[23:12] he's given Jesus full benefit the
[23:18] Godfather even the Lord Jesus Christ
[23:24] he's the same person all right
[23:28] first I thank my God through Jesus
[23:30] Christ for you all because remember when
[23:33] you got to go to Christ yes Jesus Christ
[23:37] is to walk the way the truth and the
[23:39] life could walk to understand the father
[23:41] to understand the father you got to go
[23:43] through Jesus Christ oh he wasn't
[23:45] healing we never met God the Creator no
[23:52] man has seen God in a town called the
[23:54] Bible but there was somebody came here
[23:57] that what showed us who he was alright
[24:01] and that way we cannot you can't
[24:02] understand a God that when he spoke
[24:04] Genesis 1:26 that today he's not one
[24:07] second over not one second is he older
[24:10] than when he said let there be life and
[24:12] it's been of course Megan to you if you
[24:14] wanted to be and you can't fathom that
[24:17] neither can i how can you find an
[24:19] eternity brother Brown's eternity go to
[24:21] both ways so you go back as far as you
[24:23] want to you keep on being being BAE BAE
[24:24] BAE BAE available to keep on big baby
[24:26] baby in and he's not even a second over
[24:28] than he was see we can't find
[24:30] that but now Jesus trots them down in
[24:32] time we can fathom that so through him I
[24:35] can see the father
[24:36] man if you've seen me you've seen the
[24:39] father that's right I think my dog do
[24:44] Jesus Christ for you all that your faith
[24:46] is spoken of throughout the world Loula
[24:48] Georgia for God is my witness whom I
[24:52] serve with my spirit in the gospel of
[24:54] his son that without ceasing I made
[24:57] mention of you always in my prayers
[25:00] making requests if by any means now a
[25:04] twinks I might have a prosperous journey
[25:07] by the will of God to come unto you all
[25:09] right so he's requesting to go to Rome
[25:11] all right
[25:12] for how long to see you that I may
[25:15] impart unto you some spiritual gift to
[25:19] the interview may be established
[25:20] now look Paul's not standing there with
[25:22] a bag of gifts and they have nothing
[25:26] that's not what he said
[25:28] but remember Paul comes to Timothy or
[25:33] whoever it was he lays his hand on
[25:35] Timothy and he receives gift because the
[25:39] life comes through the body maybe Rome
[25:41] had not been taught the thing same way
[25:43] with Luther Georgia maybe there's people
[25:45] that don't understand our language but
[25:49] we may Park some spiritual gift because
[25:52] the first thing we say spirit from here
[25:54] why don't we think of I think the first
[25:58] wisdom faith read them all okay times
[26:02] and interpretations are okay but if you
[26:04] don't have wisdom you know what is today
[26:07] the man I said if you don't have wisdom
[26:10] it's the devil the devil just speaking
[26:12] time all right but he can't have wisdom
[26:15] of God he can't have the wisdom of God
[26:20] you can have the wisdom of God and then
[26:24] black Paul says let me interpolate Paul
[26:29] is saying I might have something that
[26:32] you have not previously had before
[26:36] not so secret not some I'm better than
[26:39] you are Paul never puffed himself up but
[26:42] Paul being a prophet he knew if he could
[26:44] go to them and speak to them he may have
[26:47] something a little extra together
[26:52] wisdom faith knowledge and all those
[26:54] different things
[26:54] okay so Paul's not puffing it up he's
[26:56] saying he said that I'm laying apart
[26:58] unto you some spiritual gift look to the
[27:01] end you may be established
[27:05] what establish what church no sounds
[27:07] them to faith right cuz they don't have
[27:10] a Bible to read seeing how they look at
[27:12] that they don't have a Bible to read so
[27:15] they have to have faith in what some man
[27:17] said that's why in the first three
[27:19] church changes God protected that white
[27:22] rocks his church the real one there was
[27:26] a false when they connected to it you
[27:27] know what that falsehood is started
[27:29] teaching the same thing the other ones
[27:30] did except about that much off just
[27:33] enough to get them off but there was a
[27:36] true church there and Paul was talking
[27:38] to the true church that when they absorb
[27:40] something from the preacher it went into
[27:43] them any what if it bore fruit okay
[27:49] that's what Paul's saying sound coming
[27:50] to impart to you some spiritual gift not
[27:53] gifts believe us a prophet
[27:57] if even the prophet from God we should
[28:00] listen to it same way we run around meet
[28:02] the property god we should listen to
[28:04] Minister the gospel brother they don't
[28:05] need anybody like that you should listen
[28:07] to it and then the good thing we have is
[28:10] though is we have the internet and we
[28:12] have Paul's and record and play and
[28:15] backwards and listen to it yesterday but
[28:17] you know what I was thinking the other
[28:19] day do you know if you were saying who
[28:22] wanted Paul Sherman and he was preaching
[28:25] your sermon and you didn't make him back
[28:28] into the same service your Lobster
[28:35] you lost it are you gonna get it they
[28:41] went somewhere I wasn't riding it down
[28:43] now Paul me under the grace of God mate
[28:46] do I wait to a lot of times and back up
[28:49] and you know redo a part of it sermon
[28:53] but if you missed it you dismissed it
[28:55] but you know what though I knew that God
[28:57] knew that we would have everything else
[28:58] involved was talking to somebody the
[29:01] other day you know God knows we're busy
[29:04] he knew this was what we needed we had
[29:07] to have something in writing we had to
[29:09] have something on the internet that we
[29:11] weren't busy or take a vacation not a
[29:14] problem with that don't mind it a bit
[29:16] all right but just lay it out to you
[29:18] know that you know when you're laying
[29:20] out or not we don't have to be we don't
[29:22] have to get up freaks about people
[29:23] laying out of church you know when you
[29:25] let out you're you know going somewhere
[29:30] that's fine and you know what we got all
[29:31] this other these other things you can
[29:33] watch online stuff which is wonderful
[29:35] they didn't have that back then but you
[29:38] know what God equipped them with some
[29:40] sounding board some hearing that we
[29:42] don't have comes remember the Bible says
[29:45] we have become dull of hearing yes we
[29:47] have yes I guess they focused a lot more
[29:51] on own sermons than we do that sometimes
[29:54] we'll get that next one do one sermon
[30:00] that's it one had done I mean they were
[30:02] warning in from one sermon and it went
[30:04] alone
[30:05] you know 45 minutes maybe I don't know
[30:08] if all that was written down is
[30:09] everything Peter said but you know what
[30:13] they got the gist of what Paul Peter was
[30:15] talking about and they said man I don't
[30:17] want what you pierce it okay
[30:21] repent so anyway so let's keep going a
[30:28] real American clock alright verse 12
[30:34] that is that I may be comforted together
[30:37] with you by the mutual faith of both of
[30:41] you and me so they're putting afraid
[30:44] together that's
[30:46] our problem is we are facing this and
[30:48] that in the other and the other brother
[30:49] over here in this other preacher over
[30:51] here I don't say listen don't be so
[30:53] narrow-minded we we can't listen listen
[30:57] to me we can't listen just the brother
[30:58] Dale to make it that's not what the
[31:01] Bible said about said apostles prophets
[31:04] pastors teachers and evangelist for the
[31:06] perfecting of the Saints we gonna make
[31:08] fivefold ministry you can't make it with
[31:12] it we had a one-man message and that was
[31:15] William Brown now it's multiple multiple
[31:19] we need we need the different
[31:21] diversities that's why we so follow it's
[31:24] a five for mastery you open one fold and
[31:26] there's apostle you open this follow
[31:29] that's prophet open this told that's
[31:30] teacher right well verse 13 now I would
[31:37] not have you ignorant brethren that
[31:38] oftentimes I purposed to come unto you
[31:41] now here he's in trapeze telling him why
[31:44] but was let let hitherto in other words
[31:47] what was he done he would let here - in
[31:49] other words he was hindered whether God
[31:53] didn't wanted to go there you know
[31:54] brother a lot of times he prayed God
[31:56] tell him no you wouldn't go okay okay
[31:59] then I might have some fruit among you
[32:02] also even as among other Gentiles
[32:05] because remember most of Romans most of
[32:08] Rome was Gentiles there was a few Jews
[32:13] but most of Roman man that I mean there
[32:16] he's and Gentiles remember Rome conquers
[32:19] world and maybe they the ones that come
[32:20] up with crucifixion that they're going
[32:22] to come up with all these horrible
[32:24] tortures and stuff okay so Rome was just
[32:26] a heathen place or Italy you may say the
[32:29] country of Italy was Italy Italy at that
[32:32] time yeah but was it just Rome a part of
[32:36] whatever do
[32:39] yeah wasn't it wasn't it wasn't Italy so
[32:42] we'll just use Rome because Rome is
[32:44] gonna be the seat of everything anyways
[32:45] so kind of interesting that holds all
[32:50] the way through that you know even even
[32:53] when we get the revelations they're
[32:54] gonna drop a bomb in the Vatican you
[32:56] know run around said they gonna drop a
[32:57] bomb right on top of the batteries so
[33:00] will the Vatican is we're in Rome
[33:02] downtown yeah okay so so that's the seat
[33:08] you know that's the seat of Satan that's
[33:10] where and you know what it's gonna make
[33:11] the people even made nominal people so
[33:13] mad it's gonna make politicians so mad
[33:15] it's gonna make the government so mad to
[33:18] whoever's bomb it is it's gonna hit that
[33:20] thing and blow it up so they hated it to
[33:23] verse 14 I am dead or both to the Greeks
[33:26] and to the barbarians oh my gosh all
[33:30] don't go talk to them people but he's in
[33:33] debt to them both to the wives and I'm
[33:38] like what kind of grace is that so as
[33:43] much as in as in me is I am ready to
[33:48] preach the gospel to you that are at
[33:49] Rome also so he's getting ready to make
[33:51] the trip all right for I am not ashamed
[33:54] of the gospel of Christ for it is the
[33:58] power of God unto salvation to everyone
[34:03] that what he brings it to do Greek Rome
[34:08] anybody to everyone that believeth keep
[34:16] going to the Jew first no we know
[34:18] obviously we know that he came that
[34:21] Jesus Christ came to the Jews first okay
[34:24] and they turned you down so low I go to
[34:26] the Gentiles I mean you you got that
[34:28] right know what for there in now what
[34:33] they're in what what is there in the
[34:35] salvation because it the power of God in
[34:38] salvation see Paul holiness stop for
[34:42] therein is the righteousness of God
[34:44] revealed from faith to faith
[34:49] see that's the statue of Pergamon you
[34:52] keep on believing faith virtue remember
[34:56] I preached a long time ago virtue faith
[34:58] knowledge faith temperance faith you got
[35:01] to believe that that's what God that
[35:03] that's the face of God and that the
[35:06] virtue has the virtue of God temperance
[35:07] is attention temperance of God as it is
[35:11] written the just shall live by faith
[35:14] he goes right back to a lack of two and
[35:17] four so he goes back in the Old
[35:19] Testament and pulls it out to just shall
[35:22] live by faith now see that guy these
[35:27] letters I don't want to say got lost but
[35:31] they kind of did you know the didn't get
[35:33] picked up the label found and put
[35:34] together and all that because what
[35:36] Martin Luther picks that out right there
[35:39] he says man that's in the Old Testament
[35:42] and now I'm reading Paul what you mean
[35:45] the just shall live by faith I gotta do
[35:49] penance is that me I understand why
[35:51] Martin Luther preached to just shall
[35:54] live by faith
[35:56] they just shall live by faith now what
[36:00] the Catholic Church is is the just shall
[36:02] live by penance right don't eat fish
[36:08] cracker eat fish on Friday and you don't
[36:11] still on family take your rosary bead
[36:14] that's untrue three beads but take the
[36:15] rosary beads out break well times you
[36:17] know the certain Saints right that's
[36:21] what the Catholic Church had put from
[36:22] right here from right here he's talking
[36:25] until Martin Luther which dish was in 80
[36:27] 60 of Martin Luther came in about one
[36:29] 1400 1500 some went down
[36:32] look come on I stay here mess that up
[36:36] cause Paul's telling me said hey the
[36:39] power of God unto salvation is that to
[36:41] just show everything and that string we
[36:45] still do that we live my faith we are
[36:48] faith people yeah show me justification
[36:52] take it out hitting them show me
[36:55] sanctification take you down entertain
[36:56] you because I don't have faith if I say
[36:59] well I don't need to find my
[37:00] I don't I find the phone there any one
[37:08] hand that's not faith faith is like
[37:11] brother branham saying this so i stumped
[37:13] a lot of people he said if i may have
[37:15] left my knife on them on the counter in
[37:20] the motel room he said but i if i
[37:22] believe they died put it in my pocket
[37:25] it'll be in my heart that's faith
[37:29] without sight roman catholic church was
[37:32] faith with sight because look you gotta
[37:37] understand one thing there are some we
[37:39] said roman catholic and everybody goes
[37:41] hell down here you know no they're not
[37:45] all hellbound people God will give them
[37:47] eternal life maybe whatever they decide
[37:50] by their works that's all they knew
[37:53] that's all we knew but when Martin
[37:55] Luther don't say that's how I work when
[37:58] Martin Luther comes out in that fourth
[38:00] Church age 15 and says the judge oh my
[38:04] fate and began preaching that's why
[38:06] that's why brother MC turn the world
[38:09] upside down why he changed her thinking
[38:11] but what happened was they got so
[38:13] radical about it so they went out and
[38:15] started burning Catholic churches and
[38:17] killing I don't know if he ever killed a
[38:18] priest but they sure didn't beat him up
[38:19] pretty bad that way what Martin Luther
[38:22] was saying he was he was not saying the
[38:25] just shall live by the sword no he was
[38:28] saying the just shall live by faith and
[38:30] you know what he was preaching of
[38:32] separation gospel yes but not separating
[38:35] kill these you know do away with these
[38:37] no you gotta leave them alone leave them
[38:38] out here but you separate yourself so
[38:41] here Paul is saying the just shall live
[38:43] by faith he's going back to lavaca but
[38:46] Martin Luther Reeves axes man I see it
[38:48] in Paul's writings and I see it in the
[38:50] Old Testament there's something to this
[38:52] and you know what the Holy Ghost comes
[38:53] down quick things what he read and here
[38:58] he went we don't need to you know be if
[39:01] you ever watch the movie now that movie
[39:03] was good I think it was however finds or
[39:05] one of them played it was a more modern
[39:07] one but it really showed that he was
[39:10] trying to be a good mom
[39:12] he was trying to be a good Catholic guy
[39:14] yeah I mean he'd crawl on the floor and
[39:17] lay out you know on the floor trying to
[39:18] get those evil things out of his mind
[39:21] and all all you need was didn't you burn
[39:23] he didn't need to beat itself okay so
[39:26] that's what Paul's saying you believe
[39:29] faith you gotta take faith than
[39:32] believing and put them together okay
[39:35] faith is the substance of things hoped
[39:37] for the evidence of things not seen
[39:39] so nobody has seen Jesus Christ hanging
[39:43] on cross Lily okay when I stand over
[39:46] there in Arizona the thunders are is
[39:49] this great mystery that God's hid in the
[39:51] Bible but it's in every word every page
[39:55] of the Bible is a thunder comes was the
[39:57] voice of God speaking in a man all right
[40:00] so let's finish this right here and then
[40:01] we'll go down about two minutes force 18
[40:06] for the wrath of God is revealed from
[40:08] heaven remember there's nothing on earth
[40:11] going to give you a revelation your
[40:13] revelation has to come from God out of
[40:16] this dimension from another dimension to
[40:19] use that's what he's saying
[40:20] it's revealed from heaven against all
[40:23] ungodliness and unrighteousness of men
[40:25] look who hold the truth in
[40:29] unrighteousness now we're gonna stop
[40:31] right there don't you think about that
[40:33] till next Sunday look they hold the
[40:37] truth in unrighteousness they have the
[40:42] truth but somehow they add something or
[40:45] take something from it make it
[40:46] unrighteous we'll talk about that next
[40:48] honey let's go
[40:52] yep
[40:54] [Music]
