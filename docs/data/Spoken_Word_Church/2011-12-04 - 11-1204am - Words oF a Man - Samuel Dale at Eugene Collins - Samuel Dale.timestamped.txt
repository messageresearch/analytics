[42:43] fill it up with people oh yes because we
[42:46] believe you thank you we commit it to
[42:49] you now in Jesus name
[42:52] Exodus 32 kind of where we were at last
[42:55] night on the
[42:56] information these things and then we'll
[42:58] just continue on the thought
[43:01] this was Moses now when he was coming
[43:03] down off the mountain after the you know
[43:06] the children of Israel that made the
[43:08] golden cage and the things
[43:12] look what he said verse 30 and he came
[43:14] to pass on tomorrow that Moses said unto
[43:17] the people yes send the great standing
[43:19] now I will go up unto the Lord free
[43:22] adventure I shall make an atonement for
[43:24] your sin
[43:25] and Moses returned unto the Lord and
[43:28] said oh these people have sinned to
[43:30] Great sin and have made them gods and
[43:32] gold
[43:33] yet now if that will forgive their sin
[43:36] and if not like me I pray thee out of
[43:40] thy book which thou has written
[43:42] and the Lord said unto Moses whosoever
[43:45] shall Ascend against me him will I
[43:49] blocked out of my book
[43:51] therefore go now lead the people under
[43:55] the place which I have spoken unto thee
[43:57] behold my angel shall go before thee
[44:00] nevertheless in the day when I visited I
[44:04] will visit their sin upon them you may
[44:07] be seated
[44:08] blessing for the meaning of the word now
[44:12] I asked you there
[44:14] last night to reconsider a call
[44:20] we think about an atonement
[44:23] we read here Moses said you know
[44:25] pre-adventure I'll go up and make an
[44:28] atonement well we know that something
[44:30] happened because God did not kill the
[44:34] children of Israel right then and sure
[44:37] we know he dealt with them later in the
[44:39] doings but he was still taking them on
[44:42] toward the promised land which was his
[44:45] promise to them yes but you know the
[44:48] question I've asked is what atonement
[44:51] did Moses make
[44:54] what atonement did he make was it a cave
[44:57] was it a goat was it a on a you know a
[45:00] terminal a pigeon whatever what was the
[45:05] thing that he made
[45:07] now into considering that I want us to
[45:11] think about Hebrews 1.
[45:14] where did it says in Sandra times in
[45:16] diverse manners God speak in times of
[45:18] passion
[45:19] in which the word is by there which
[45:22] would be in the prophets you know what
[45:25] happened in these last days spoken unto
[45:26] us in his son so we went through last
[45:29] night looking at the Christ
[45:32] and seeing the Christ of the Bible and
[45:35] uh
[45:37] those Prophets
[45:39] what I want you to think about for a
[45:41] minute is that uh how did
[45:44] Abraham come up when they were in the
[45:47] slaughter of the Kings and and he said
[45:49] I'll give you 10 percent
[45:51] why did he say it like that
[45:54] you know
[45:55] you don't ever think about those things
[45:57] as you're reading along in in your
[46:00] studies and things
[46:01] and see that's what we're set for we're
[46:04] to jog your memory about it but
[46:08] see I believe that Abraham picked that
[46:11] thought up from God yes it is brother
[46:13] why didn't he say 20 80 90 or whatever
[46:18] he should have given him every bit of it
[46:19] you know but see then why did he say 10
[46:23] and then we turn around and why do we
[46:25] pay a 10 time
[46:27] you know it's not an accident or a
[46:30] daughter a good idea you know I believe
[46:34] those Prophets
[46:35] could enter into so much until they
[46:39] would receive the very mind of God and
[46:43] he would speak through them just as
[46:44] Moses would go up and bring down the
[46:47] Commandments in the banks and just that
[46:50] he could write Genesis Exodus Leviticus
[46:52] Numbers Deuteronomy you know
[46:55] that he could write all of those books
[46:59] from what he received from God on the
[47:02] mountain yes he could tell what happened
[47:04] in Genesis you know you said well it was
[47:07] just you know what had happened was it
[47:09] was just a lot of of people you know and
[47:12] they still do that in a lot of places
[47:14] that they have people that are that are
[47:16] really to remember what goes on right
[47:20] yeah and you know there's a big word for
[47:22] that but they they keep up with it and
[47:24] they're lineages and things they keep up
[47:26] with it they don't have to write it down
[47:27] they keep up with it from memory right
[47:30] and that's wonderful that's that's fine
[47:33] but see there wasn't anybody back there
[47:36] to have the memory of to write or what
[47:39] happened in Genesis so Moses got from
[47:43] God
[47:45] you know what God wanted us to read
[47:47] today yes all right so he he brought it
[47:51] down and he really picked up the thought
[47:55] see him run around and sit in and see a
[47:56] book and said it was first said it was
[47:59] gone stop he said it's not the word yet
[48:03] he said he gives it to Moses and said it
[48:05] becomes Moses to stop he said it's still
[48:07] not the word he said that Moses Goes
[48:10] Forth and speaks it he said now it's the
[48:13] word all right so then that word is the
[48:17] greatest of all things that we could
[48:19] think of and I remember when we were
[48:22] reading last night this time the two
[48:24] together that we were reading about that
[48:26] Peter said about Jesus that are in John
[48:30] you know said thou Hast the words
[48:33] of eternal life
[48:35] what about a man being given the word of
[48:39] eternal life no
[48:41] the Bible says it and your Prophet said
[48:44] it that you know that we were able to
[48:47] impart eternal life
[48:49] he said now here's the way to do it
[48:54] he told us how to do it he said well
[48:56] I'll just go out and just give it to
[48:57] anybody want to no
[48:59] it wouldn't want to happen he said
[49:01] here's how to do it he said you take
[49:03] Acts 2 38.
[49:06] where it says repent every one of them
[49:08] be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ
[49:09] he said now you can talk about imparting
[49:13] eternal life right why because you're
[49:14] giving them the God's word all right see
[49:18] through those prophets would as I said
[49:21] they would pick up the thought of God
[49:23] then they would translate that down to
[49:26] the human and like who is it naming that
[49:30] said you know he saw chariots Jocelyn in
[49:33] the streets uh running like lightning
[49:35] and things you know torches and all well
[49:38] see he was looking down and seeing out
[49:40] here on these interstates of of Buicks
[49:42] and Oldsmobiles and Cadillacs running
[49:44] into each other and running up down the
[49:46] highway with the lights on you know and
[49:48] things but he couldn't say those words
[49:50] because those words were not in the
[49:53] human vocabulary at the time and he
[49:56] didn't know what to call him so he
[49:57] called him chariots Jocelyn in the
[50:00] streets you know and if you're asking
[50:02] what it is used to
[50:04] all I know to tell you is it was some
[50:07] kind of a moving object yes and it was
[50:09] going and had lights on it and stuff
[50:11] like that see because it was if that was
[50:14] the point of what it is right but see
[50:17] get the point now and then we'll get
[50:18] into the main thought
[50:21] those prophets would pick up the thought
[50:23] of God
[50:25] and they would actually bring it down to
[50:28] us
[50:30] and that's the way the Bible was written
[50:32] all right yeah
[50:34] and and they would receive that thought
[50:37] yes
[50:38] and they put it into words
[50:40] all right then see we do believe them
[50:43] now that we have the word of God yes
[50:46] right right we believe the Bible we have
[50:50] today is the word of God that would be
[50:52] you know if it was any way of bringing
[50:54] it any other way then God would have
[50:57] chose to done it that way because he he
[50:59] done the perfect way of doing it and he
[51:02] brought it Down To Us by the prophets
[51:03] sometime all right now we'll get on down
[51:06] to where we are more in in a little
[51:07] while but I want you to think on
[51:10] something with me that
[51:13] we know that when Moses said this to God
[51:16] you know he said block my name out too
[51:18] he meant it yes it is amen what he was
[51:22] doing and he was willing to put himself
[51:24] on the line
[51:25] yes Paul said I I would be a Castaway If
[51:30] my people could be saved oh listen now
[51:33] here's the words that wrote around me he
[51:35] said you're not worthy of living until
[51:38] you're willing to die paraphrase in
[51:41] that's right and to die for others it's
[51:45] easy to maybe die for somebody that's
[51:47] good for you to you you know doing
[51:49] something but what about your enemies
[51:52] we're supposed to love our enemies
[51:55] we say well no we we just can't love our
[51:58] enemy well why not
[52:01] Jesus loved his enemies and he prayed
[52:04] for them that despitefully used him and
[52:05] everything else all right so then as as
[52:08] we're looking at it
[52:12] get the thought in your mind of God
[52:15] actually using man yes
[52:20] to transmit
[52:22] his thoughts
[52:25] down into word form
[52:28] that could be read yes
[52:32] see he would do it in in mysterious ways
[52:35] and we know that that when
[52:37] God met
[52:40] you know Moses started to burning bush
[52:44] he told him to take off your shoes
[52:46] because you're standing on the Holy
[52:47] Ground
[52:48] well now what I want you to watch is
[52:51] progressiveness because that's what I
[52:53] like to do I like to take something here
[52:55] and then see it progress like we did
[52:57] last night and we saw the Christ we saw
[53:00] him back there we saw him create we saw
[53:02] him bring everything into it just we saw
[53:04] him through the Old Testament we saw him
[53:06] then coming into Jesus upon the Earth
[53:09] then we saw him coming into you and I to
[53:11] be Christ in you the hope of glory I
[53:13] like to progress like that so we hear a
[53:17] lot said and people use it in in all
[53:19] about Moses and at the burning bush and
[53:22] God said take off your shoes
[53:25] well you know that was good and he saw
[53:27] him and he heard him and he gave him his
[53:30] Commission
[53:31] well now if you'll get over into Joshua
[53:37] you'll find that Joshua then receives
[53:40] his Commission
[53:45] Moses received the commission
[53:48] Joshua received the commission stray
[53:50] from God but you know what I like about
[53:53] Joshua you read during Joshua you know
[53:56] that as I said we say a lot about Moses
[53:59] in the burning bush
[54:01] but Joshua was standing out there one
[54:03] day
[54:04] you know walking around and he looks
[54:07] over and he sees this man standing there
[54:10] well he naturally he knew he wasn't one
[54:13] of them
[54:14] so he just grabbed his sword
[54:16] you know yes he said are you Forest are
[54:21] you for the enemy
[54:23] well
[54:25] this man spoke back to him he said I'm
[54:28] done on either side
[54:31] I've come to take over amen all right he
[54:35] met the captain of the host right right
[54:38] you know Moses so God in a burning wish
[54:41] and heard a voice
[54:43] but Joshua
[54:45] met a man do you see we're probably
[54:48] higher yes
[54:49] progression going up that's why I like
[54:52] to look at the Bible yes sir
[54:54] God if the man that was standing there
[54:56] go Moses take your shoes off
[55:04] Moses at the burning bush to take your
[55:06] shoes off
[55:07] all right see when he met
[55:10] in other words he saw a man
[55:13] Moses didn't get to see the man
[55:17] he later saw the back part of a man but
[55:20] he was not capable of seeing the man but
[55:23] here stand the man absolutely
[55:26] he said I'm the captain of the Lord's
[55:28] Holy Spirit he saw the Christ
[55:31] standing in a human vessel
[55:35] why can't we look then and see it keep
[55:38] climbing until one day
[55:41] the Bible said no man can see God
[55:44] that means seemed like with the eye of
[55:48] natural understanding
[55:51] because one day a man walked upon this
[55:54] Earth
[55:56] that he said if you seen me
[56:00] you sing the father
[56:03] the verse took the same one that met
[56:06] Moses at the burning bush that Moses
[56:09] finally saw the black part
[56:12] all right then you see that same man was
[56:15] the one that Joshua met that was the
[56:18] captain of the Lord's host
[56:20] the then here he stands upon Earth
[56:24] and he said do you sing the father
[56:28] they said well where's he at he said
[56:29] he's standing here talking to you all
[56:32] right so you've got greater and greater
[56:34] and greater all right now but it has to
[56:37] get greater because you and I
[56:39] must see time back to last night we must
[56:42] see by the new birth
[56:46] that we see God in Greater measure than
[56:49] even if we were standing looking at him
[56:51] absolutely right yes sir even if you're
[56:55] standing back and literally seeing him I
[56:58] mean you could walk up and shook his
[57:00] hand you know
[57:08] the Bible said he was seen of over 500
[57:11] Brethren asked for his resurrection
[57:13] right
[57:14] but worse than 380 that didn't make it
[57:17] to the upper room right right there's
[57:21] only 120 minutes
[57:23] and the others have seen him answering
[57:25] right yes
[57:28] see God
[57:30] well look right into his word
[57:34] because Satan can impersonate right
[57:38] right he can come to you as an angel
[57:42] that's right you can come to yourself
[57:43] and you see
[57:48] but I'd rather have it in the word amen
[57:52] because Satan can't impersonate the word
[57:56] we try to do everything he tries to
[57:59] twist it and turn it but he can't be the
[58:02] word
[58:03] prophet of God said he can't be the Holy
[58:05] Ghost
[58:06] but now you be the great anointing that
[58:09] goes out in anoints and all kinds of
[58:10] stuff but he can't bring the word word
[58:13] for word all right because that word
[58:15] means more than you think
[58:19] to just hold it is the old black brother
[58:22] said
[58:24] you know I blame it from the camera to
[58:27] kill her he said and I even believe the
[58:29] camera goes to God Holy Bible right now
[58:32] see that's where we we should believe it
[58:35] and cherish the fact
[58:38] that we are in the winding up
[58:41] so we are in the more positive state of
[58:45] seeing things
[58:46] when this prophet of God came in the
[58:49] last days to bring us the message
[58:51] because I see him last night see he
[58:54] brought us the word
[58:57] let me turn alive
[59:00] right
[59:01] see people saw
[59:03] and talk to a man that God could use to
[59:08] speak squirrels into existence and all
[59:10] kind of things and stormed out
[59:12] consistently
[59:14] but where are those people that actually
[59:16] saw him
[59:17] mulatto turned against it
[59:21] force of healing I've got some of the
[59:23] magazines that they had in the 50s
[59:25] that
[59:27] you know they were saying I'd run around
[59:30] saying pray that God sent a prophet
[59:33] I mean they were saying that in the
[59:34] magazine and then printing that brother
[59:37] random was traveling the world and that
[59:39] 30 000 people healed and went Oliver
[59:41] called
[59:44] in the magazine yeah
[59:46] but yet they're saying fast and pray for
[59:49] God to send the problem
[59:50] I never did understand somebody didn't
[59:54] ask some questions I know I'm a Dundee
[59:57] and I understand that but I don't
[59:59] understand when everybody hears brother
[1:00:01] random talking you know and he said that
[1:00:03] we've never had a man
[1:00:05] by the name of H.A.M you know I was
[1:00:08] still this nice days and said we got a
[1:00:10] Billy Graham
[1:00:12] g-r-a-h-a-n so that's six letters
[1:00:15] but said now Abram said he had to have
[1:00:18] his name changed he said he wound up
[1:00:20] being Abraham and he said that's 700.
[1:00:23] and said no
[1:00:25] you know everybody could look at him
[1:00:28] talking about Billy Graham but I wonder
[1:00:29] why somebody didn't walk up in and say
[1:00:31] what is your name oh yeah William seven
[1:00:35] letters
[1:00:36] marry me seven letters Brown 7-Eleven
[1:00:41] so you can match that one it was back
[1:00:44] down with the 7-Eleven and you know that
[1:00:46] his name was not Bradham
[1:00:48] his daddy changed the name you know the
[1:00:50] story
[1:00:51] if you don't let me know it hold on I'll
[1:00:53] be glad to get it his daddy actually it
[1:00:55] was Greyhound
[1:00:57] his daddy added the end to it making it
[1:01:00] brown
[1:01:03] see because it wouldn't have matched up
[1:01:04] because his daddy had to change his name
[1:01:08] well I thought it was our daddy had to
[1:01:09] give us a new name change her name
[1:01:12] before it's any good but my point is
[1:01:16] which is the greatest
[1:01:20] would you rather have this day
[1:01:24] God just stand here
[1:01:28] you know in a human fashion that you
[1:01:31] could talk to
[1:01:33] you can ask him questions you know
[1:01:36] and you'd rather have that
[1:01:39] or as you rather have his word
[1:01:43] that would answer all of our questions
[1:01:45] right
[1:01:47] which is the greatest
[1:01:49] he said what I I see if you say well I'd
[1:01:52] rather be in his presence well
[1:01:56] you know because in his presidency might
[1:01:58] have to kill us
[1:02:01] you know that he can't stand in the
[1:02:04] presence of sin
[1:02:05] problem
[1:02:06] you said well I want God standing here I
[1:02:09] don't want God standing here right that
[1:02:11] was the perusian years ago or Garcia the
[1:02:14] big words they used
[1:02:16] that they wanted his presence I said I
[1:02:19] offended people one night by saying it
[1:02:20] in the ministry fellowship meeting we
[1:02:23] read and I said I don't want him
[1:02:24] standing here beside him
[1:02:26] if he did he might kill me I'm gonna do
[1:02:29] something wrong and I said but if I've
[1:02:30] got him inside of me
[1:02:32] I think about it
[1:02:35] did he take care of all the problems see
[1:02:38] what am I doing take it the word to his
[1:02:40] eyes form to see the value of the word
[1:02:45] that's the main thing that I wanted you
[1:02:47] to see yes sir
[1:02:48] the value of the word and even to my
[1:02:52] people they know I didn't approach these
[1:02:54] things there's a way that even at home
[1:02:56] so I'm asking them to think about it the
[1:02:59] value
[1:03:00] of the word
[1:03:03] how great it is for us to be able to
[1:03:06] read the Bible
[1:03:09] and it reads the same letters
[1:03:12] and things because I always liked and
[1:03:15] you know I didn't know this girl when
[1:03:17] brother Brown come along I didn't use it
[1:03:18] someone said you like the Thompson Chain
[1:03:20] but that's all right but he used the
[1:03:22] Scofield bible
[1:03:24] I always like the Scofield bible
[1:03:27] even when I was in the bathroom and
[1:03:29] things like that I I I I I wanted to
[1:03:32] Schofield Bible I like them all right
[1:03:34] see then that doesn't mean that the
[1:03:37] Scofield is only one it just means the
[1:03:40] one alive yeah because I I got used to
[1:03:43] it if you know the story in your
[1:03:45] Scoville Bible it doesn't matter if it's
[1:03:47] this big or if it's that big
[1:03:50] everything is on the same side of the
[1:03:52] page
[1:03:54] and I'm just a dummy I give you some
[1:03:57] things being on the left what is that
[1:03:59] word where's the school teacher at the
[1:04:01] heifer
[1:04:02] um Autistic or what is the word that you
[1:04:05] don't like changes well that's that's
[1:04:07] the way it is I don't like changes I
[1:04:10] like
[1:04:11] and
[1:04:15] if you see mine you'll see that I got
[1:04:17] marks on on those you know you know like
[1:04:20] that because I believe that we have the
[1:04:22] word now
[1:04:24] not to Scofield bible I'm talking about
[1:04:27] the King James version and I read all
[1:04:29] the other versions too I read a lot of
[1:04:31] them I have one book that are valued
[1:04:33] highly it's got 26 translations in it
[1:04:36] and I use it a lot
[1:04:39] to compare the things that I'm looking
[1:04:42] at all right but see the Bro the prophet
[1:04:45] said we now have God's word
[1:04:49] to where even the these the ands and the
[1:04:51] books is in the right place
[1:04:53] all right so evident that this was what
[1:04:57] God wanted before the world this was the
[1:05:00] book he wrote before the world yes all
[1:05:02] right absolutely and in writing that
[1:05:04] book before the world
[1:05:05] he transmitted it down to mankind
[1:05:09] all right it took thousands of years if
[1:05:13] you know the story behind the King James
[1:05:15] version
[1:05:16] that they took like I forgot 15 powers
[1:05:19] or 16 pairs of of men and they gave each
[1:05:22] one of them a scripture to translate
[1:05:25] and they would put them in Paris two
[1:05:27] year two year two here two here and they
[1:05:30] when they came back they all had to have
[1:05:33] the same exact wording or understanding
[1:05:38] and then they would write it down
[1:05:41] he's showing you the Holy Spirit could
[1:05:43] lead man to do those things now
[1:05:47] what about the words of a man then
[1:05:51] I
[1:05:52] hope the background of that part gets in
[1:05:55] there that we can understand
[1:05:57] that the value of words
[1:06:02] we use words to express ourselves in
[1:06:05] that reform
[1:06:07] the language is all over you
[1:06:09] different wordings but still we can
[1:06:12] communicate
[1:06:14] they take a little while but I mean like
[1:06:16] it was in Brazil when I was trying to
[1:06:19] think sister Cesar for for letting us
[1:06:23] come and being there with them and I
[1:06:26] called her a help me
[1:06:27] it doesn't say help name Genesis uh
[1:06:30] people read that doesn't say it they
[1:06:32] made Adam help me m-e-t
[1:06:35] don't say mate you know all right we're
[1:06:39] going to make it be too many it doesn't
[1:06:41] matter but to me it's a different word
[1:06:42] when you translated that to Portuguese
[1:06:45] it came out m-e-a-t oh
[1:06:50] I was calling her a hamburger
[1:06:53] but we got it all together and we had a
[1:06:56] good life at it but still irregardless
[1:06:59] you can translate words the word that
[1:07:02] you come to a place of having a great
[1:07:04] understanding
[1:07:06] all right now the Bible says at the
[1:07:09] words of a man
[1:07:11] we'll get to that in a minute
[1:07:13] but that's what I want you to think
[1:07:14] about
[1:07:16] Moses goes up before God
[1:07:20] and he said now Lord
[1:07:24] if you kill them kill me too
[1:07:28] all right
[1:07:30] now we know if we read or we're talking
[1:07:32] about it last night if you want these
[1:07:34] it's a one of the souls in prison
[1:07:37] uh
[1:07:39] trying to look paragraph
[1:07:41] like 118 117 118 119. run around said it
[1:07:45] was the spirit of Christ in Moses
[1:07:48] he said I I couldn't understand how that
[1:07:51] Moses could tell God a better way to do
[1:07:53] it but
[1:07:54] he said it was the spirit of Christ of
[1:07:56] Moses then in the message Look Away to
[1:07:58] Jesus he said
[1:08:01] it said it was Moses was Christ
[1:08:04] standing for the people
[1:08:07] all right now was that Moses that God
[1:08:11] was backing away from
[1:08:13] or was it the Christ
[1:08:16] that was in there that was dealing by
[1:08:19] way of an anointing back then because
[1:08:22] they did not have the new birth
[1:08:24] they couldn't get the new work in the
[1:08:25] Old Testament right and Moses then could
[1:08:29] seemingly tell God a better way of doing
[1:08:31] things
[1:08:32] but run around said I wondered about
[1:08:33] death and he said until I found out it
[1:08:35] was Christ in Moses
[1:08:36] all right then he could see that it was
[1:08:39] Christ's heaven reminding God all right
[1:08:42] so now what was the atonement that Moses
[1:08:45] made
[1:08:50] he didn't take an animal
[1:08:53] it was his word
[1:08:58] it was his word and to help you with it
[1:09:01] let's go over to what numbers
[1:09:07] let's go over to numbers
[1:09:11] the 14th chapter
[1:09:13] to pick up a dollar
[1:09:16] see how powerful the words of a man is
[1:09:20] you know there's a lot of people in jail
[1:09:22] because
[1:09:24] the words of a man
[1:09:26] there's people been set free from jail
[1:09:28] because of the words of man you know you
[1:09:30] know what I'm saying mankind that's a
[1:09:32] female or a male or is this mankind
[1:09:37] our words are powerful the tongue
[1:09:41] can kill or it can set free
[1:09:45] but this man Moses
[1:09:48] no
[1:09:51] when he comes over here he does
[1:09:53] something a little different because
[1:09:54] this is another story this is when
[1:09:57] you're coming over to Katie's barnia
[1:09:59] getting close
[1:10:01] all right
[1:10:03] where the other was at the time that the
[1:10:06] you know the the
[1:10:08] Motors one of them got the word to come
[1:10:10] down yes all right and the golden cake
[1:10:13] now look what he says look at numbers
[1:10:16] 14.
[1:10:19] we'll start reading about verse
[1:10:22] 13.
[1:10:24] and Moses said unto the Lord let the
[1:10:26] Egyptians shall hear it
[1:10:28] because he planned on destroying them
[1:10:31] but read the background he's going to
[1:10:33] destroy them for what you've done
[1:10:36] we said in Moses said unto the Lord then
[1:10:39] the Egyptians shall hear it
[1:10:42] for thou brought us up his people in thy
[1:10:47] might from among them and they will tell
[1:10:49] it to the inhabitants of this land for
[1:10:52] they have heard that thou Lord art among
[1:10:56] his people
[1:10:57] that thou Lord are seen face to face and
[1:11:01] that Dr Cloud standeth over them and
[1:11:04] that thou goest before them by daytime
[1:11:07] in a pillar of a cloud in a pillar of
[1:11:10] Fire by night now what he's doing he's
[1:11:13] reminding God we'll get to it the same
[1:11:16] all right
[1:11:18] reminding God of his word
[1:11:21] okay so now the people were so scared of
[1:11:25] these things that were happening
[1:11:28] right when you you get over to uh what
[1:11:31] is it to Davis born here now or when
[1:11:34] they went into uh
[1:11:37] Canaan you remember the two spies they
[1:11:41] went in and you remember the woman told
[1:11:43] them to hit him see we heard what you've
[1:11:46] done and said we had no more fight left
[1:11:49] in US
[1:11:51] read your Bible God said we had no more
[1:11:53] fight left in us
[1:11:55] when we heard what God had done yes all
[1:11:58] right so he showed him all of that but
[1:12:00] look what he's telling me
[1:12:03] now if Thou shalt kill all these people
[1:12:05] as one man verse 15 that the Nations
[1:12:08] which have heard the fame of thee will
[1:12:11] speak yes
[1:12:14] what what they'll say
[1:12:15] in other words you won't be a spirit of
[1:12:17] it if you go out and Kill Them All
[1:12:19] verse 16 because the Lord was not able
[1:12:22] to bring these people into the land
[1:12:24] which he's wearing to them therefore he
[1:12:26] has slain them in the wilderness
[1:12:29] now
[1:12:32] Moses is reminding God
[1:12:35] and I'm quoting right around
[1:12:37] that you said you would take them in
[1:12:43] and says now
[1:12:46] you come out here with him and go and
[1:12:48] kill him
[1:12:50] and said the people around here is not
[1:12:52] going to be afraid of you
[1:12:56] because they'll say you was able to
[1:12:58] bring them out but not able to take them
[1:13:00] in
[1:13:01] all right now what about a man that
[1:13:05] could tell God those words
[1:13:09] and you know God listens to him because
[1:13:10] you can read on down and find the things
[1:13:12] and look what he says verse 19 pardon
[1:13:15] not be seen Steve the iniquity of these
[1:13:17] people according to the greatness of thy
[1:13:19] mercy as thou has forgiven this people
[1:13:22] from Egypt even until now verse 21 22
[1:13:26] said he'd done done it 10 times
[1:13:28] the one
[1:13:29] and the Lord said I have pardoned
[1:13:33] according to Thy Word
[1:13:37] he pardoned the children of Israel
[1:13:40] according to his word according to that
[1:13:43] word
[1:13:45] Moses gave
[1:13:48] the people of Israel God's word
[1:13:53] and God honored that word so we see the
[1:13:58] atonement that was being made back over
[1:13:59] in the other in Exodus was the words of
[1:14:02] a man reminding God
[1:14:07] now I'm quoting brother Brown and he
[1:14:09] said
[1:14:10] God ordained Moses for the job
[1:14:15] and said he could not go over him
[1:14:19] he said if he commissions you to do
[1:14:21] something it will be done
[1:14:25] because he ordained you foreign
[1:14:29] he said Moses could
[1:14:32] go then before God
[1:14:36] and tell God
[1:14:38] them people will say
[1:14:41] that you was able to bring him out but
[1:14:44] you wasn't able to take him in
[1:14:47] he said they won't be afraid of you
[1:14:51] but the words of a man
[1:14:56] Moses's words talking to God
[1:14:59] which we know it was Christ and Moses
[1:15:01] reminding him
[1:15:03] right it would be Christ in Moses
[1:15:05] reminding God
[1:15:08] of what they were saying
[1:15:10] so he said at Thy Word
[1:15:13] I have pardoned the people
[1:15:19] at that word
[1:15:21] throw the atonement that Moses made
[1:15:27] was God's word that he reminded him
[1:15:31] he said you said you would take them in
[1:15:33] you made a promise
[1:15:37] and I'm quoting right around him he said
[1:15:39] you made a promise and we're standing on
[1:15:43] your promise
[1:15:47] I've got these in my briefcase out in
[1:15:49] the car if you want
[1:15:51] you made the promise and we're reminding
[1:15:54] you of your promise you know brother
[1:15:56] Ryan said it doesn't make God mad for
[1:15:58] you to remind him of his promise
[1:16:00] when you say buy Stripes I'm Healed
[1:16:03] you're reminding of his problem
[1:16:05] when you say if I believe in my heart
[1:16:07] confess with my mouth
[1:16:10] I shall be saved then I'm reminding of
[1:16:13] what he said
[1:16:16] when I read Malachi 4
[1:16:18] behold I send you Elijah
[1:16:21] Elijah I'm reminding of his promise he
[1:16:23] couldn't write something in the Bible
[1:16:25] and not keep it because it was a promise
[1:16:28] to somebody that's right that's why I
[1:16:30] was giving it to you their life not
[1:16:31] saying that when I would read the Bible
[1:16:33] and say you'll be there with your
[1:16:34] offspring that was a promise to me so I
[1:16:38] remind him of his promise
[1:16:42] and the children came I was standing up
[1:16:45] in a church in Tennessee one time and
[1:16:47] speaking long on that line and his
[1:16:49] brother's two sons were lost and out in
[1:16:51] the world
[1:16:53] and I looked down at him I said if you
[1:16:55] believe what I say I'll give you your
[1:16:56] two kids
[1:16:59] you said no you can't do that but I
[1:17:01] can't do that I agree with you no
[1:17:03] problem
[1:17:04] but if Christ comes through me and
[1:17:06] speaks it what's the difference you know
[1:17:09] what you want to call him one of them's
[1:17:12] a preacher in his church the other is a
[1:17:14] deacon the song leader
[1:17:17] they both come to the Lord
[1:17:19] see so it must have been true what was
[1:17:22] said yes sir that doesn't make me
[1:17:24] anything that doesn't make Moses anytime
[1:17:28] I'm not glorified man I don't even try
[1:17:31] to Glory Drive run around them
[1:17:33] no
[1:17:34] no but I said God spoke through the man
[1:17:37] I give honor to the god that spoke
[1:17:42] at the words of a man
[1:17:46] thank you it's the same time reading
[1:17:49] you're going over in Joshua and you'll
[1:17:52] find Joshua
[1:17:54] when he was out there and the battle was
[1:17:56] going pretty hot and it was coming down
[1:17:58] to the end of the day and
[1:18:00] he knew that if if they scattered that
[1:18:03] they would they would have trouble you
[1:18:05] know and they'd have to fight a lot of
[1:18:07] them again come to get back together
[1:18:08] during the night and they're out of
[1:18:10] trouble
[1:18:11] so he just not even praying not even you
[1:18:14] know he just turned around he said Son

[1:18:21] Moon you hang over there

[1:18:56] do you see a car coming towards you A
[1:18:58] big old truck on your side of the road
[1:19:00] where you are and you ain't got nowhere

[1:19:16] you know what brother writer said
[1:19:18] he said Joshua didn't have to pray
[1:19:23] he said God he was prayed up before the
[1:19:26] foundation
[1:19:30] Joshua was prayed out before the
[1:19:32] foundation of the world comes in God's
[1:19:34] mind it was what was needed he was going
[1:19:36] to a meeting up in Tennessee one time in
[1:19:39] a in a van
[1:19:41] and we're on the whole thing didn't even
[1:19:43] remembered it it's called Sam's gout he
[1:19:46] might have been in the van with us that
[1:19:47] day now I'm driving brother Tom far

[1:20:06] already in my side

[1:20:27] way brother I get a sermon yes I said I

[1:20:38] road we're just sure enough yes amen

[1:20:52] you don't understand we got to call a
[1:20:54] prayer meeting
[1:20:56] you just say it move on
[1:20:59] that's what Joshua he just said Son
[1:21:02] stands for you
[1:21:04] yes yes
[1:21:06] we know that was Christ named Joshua but
[1:21:09] it was Joshua the man
[1:21:12] you can't separate the man when it was
[1:21:15] Moses saying blood out my name he meant
[1:21:19] it when Paul said I wouldn't be a cash
[1:21:22] away from my people yeah
[1:21:26] absolutely and if you happen in it God
[1:21:29] wouldn't honor it right right see God
[1:21:32] looked down and said you're right Moses
[1:21:35] thank you Father
[1:21:36] if I go over you
[1:21:40] I'm about to get you first
[1:21:42] because you're in the way
[1:21:45] but get the point now what about that
[1:21:49] Moses reminding God
[1:21:52] of his word
[1:21:55] what about you tonight
[1:21:59] jump down a little quick down to this
[1:22:02] end time what about this prophet in the
[1:22:04] nice days
[1:22:07] that took God in his word
[1:22:09] and spoke fly I spoke with squirrels
[1:22:13] stormed out in existence cancer off of
[1:22:16] his life or a growth of his wife
[1:22:20] um salvation the sister had her out his
[1:22:23] two children the storm that was there
[1:22:26] and spoken out of existence who was that
[1:22:33] was that a man yeah
[1:22:35] it was a it was a man that had took
[1:22:38] God's word and believed
[1:22:43] he walked in that realm the word
[1:22:47] that he could bring
[1:22:49] God on the scene in front of a
[1:22:51] congregation
[1:22:53] he said you bring me 24 of your worst
[1:22:55] cases and I'll guarantee you healing for
[1:22:58] every one of them now they've never been
[1:23:01] a man on Earth sitting down outside the
[1:23:03] Lord Jesus Christ
[1:23:07] how close he stood in the realm
[1:23:10] and he was living so if we see it with
[1:23:13] Christ in Moses Christ in Joshua Christ
[1:23:15] and Abraham crashing off on them and
[1:23:17] then we see that Christ walked 2000
[1:23:19] years ago upon the shores of Galilee why
[1:23:22] can't we see that that same Christ we
[1:23:24] were talking about last night was
[1:23:25] dwelling in a man to bring us the word
[1:23:30] Luther and then were Christians right
[1:23:33] but there was no change in the body back
[1:23:35] in those periods of time because there
[1:23:37] was no word to change it that's right
[1:23:41] the atonement
[1:23:42] had to be made do we think of atonement
[1:23:45] as only being animals offer
[1:23:48] you'll find one time there in the
[1:23:49] scripture I think it's number 16 I
[1:23:51] believe 47.
[1:23:54] that
[1:23:56] Moses told Aaron
[1:23:58] because the plagues were falling and
[1:24:00] Moses told Aaron she takes the sensors
[1:24:03] from cold off the fire and run among the
[1:24:05] people
[1:24:06] and making a drama
[1:24:09] with an animal offer
[1:24:11] but it was God's ordained way
[1:24:15] God of ordained those pictures and those
[1:24:18] things
[1:24:20] the prophet said if he's ordained you
[1:24:22] for a job oh do the job
[1:24:25] and believe it
[1:24:27] he said Riverdale how can you preach him
[1:24:29] about to worry that even you go on the
[1:24:32] internet and and challenge the people
[1:24:33] come and show me where I'm wrong but if
[1:24:35] I'm wrong and you show me where I'm from
[1:24:37] then I can be held right
[1:24:39] absolutely number one I can be held but
[1:24:43] if I'm right I ain't gonna have to worry
[1:24:45] about it
[1:24:47] you wanna rap you ain't gonna show them
[1:24:50] but that ain't gonna convert nobody
[1:24:56] but I preach what I believe that's right
[1:24:59] I believe the same God as I said last
[1:25:01] night that created this world is the
[1:25:03] same God living in You by the baptism
[1:25:05] amen
[1:25:08] I believe the same God it said let that
[1:25:11] be was the same God that was standing in
[1:25:14] a man yes sir that said God don't you
[1:25:17] come over if you get anything done
[1:25:19] you're gonna come over me he didn't walk
[1:25:22] down into a higher form if you followed
[1:25:25] me while ago yes Moses into burning bush
[1:25:28] did you follow me he had seen things all
[1:25:31] right he saw the back of a man but
[1:25:33] Joshua as it progressed yes Joshua saw
[1:25:37] the man
[1:25:38] the captain of the Lord's host then one
[1:25:41] day that man walked through the source
[1:25:43] of God
[1:25:45] and that man come back in the baptism of
[1:25:48] the Holy Ghost to give a new birth
[1:25:50] that's what I'd rather be over here in
[1:25:52] the New Testament oh yes then to be back
[1:25:55] there yes I'd love to have been there to
[1:25:57] see the partner of the Red Sea I'd love
[1:26:00] to be there
[1:26:01] you'll see all of those signs wouldn't
[1:26:03] you but I'm down here at the end of all
[1:26:06] times
[1:26:07] I'm down here to see that God is going
[1:26:10] to honor a man yes sir
[1:26:14] divorce
[1:26:19] he said on there he said I say unto you
[1:26:24] but we're not the same thing Moses
[1:26:26] remember and said it said Moses gave a
[1:26:29] Grace of marriage and the Lord
[1:26:30] absolutely
[1:26:33] we're not the same one if the Apostle
[1:26:35] Paul said
[1:26:36] not the Lord
[1:26:39] but I say
[1:26:42] right amen see it was picking up the
[1:26:45] thought of the mind of God yes
[1:26:50] this is God's word or God in here he
[1:26:54] said but when the Holy Spirit comes in
[1:26:56] and picks up that cow and transmits it
[1:26:59] out to you it becomes a living reality
[1:27:02] of the word of God
[1:27:05] we have read in the Bible we'd be
[1:27:07] changed in a moment between club and I
[1:27:09] right but the man that said that
[1:27:12] went by the grave
[1:27:14] my prediction
[1:27:18] you read over in Hebrews without
[1:27:20] us they cannot be made perfect
[1:27:23] well Paul said that yes
[1:27:25] you know what one day Paul went to the
[1:27:28] ground right
[1:27:29] now he's one in the ground saying
[1:27:32] without somebody about I can't be made
[1:27:35] perfect right so that means complete
[1:27:37] right for a full age or brought forth
[1:27:41] but you see at the words of a man the
[1:27:44] sons Stood Still
[1:27:46] at the words of a man
[1:27:49] God honored that word
[1:27:52] at the words of a man
[1:27:55] God in his Christ days through a prophet
[1:27:57] has spoken the things of God that were
[1:28:00] hidden before the world ever begun
[1:28:06] to bring out the Mysteries the secrets
[1:28:10] to where we could be changed
[1:28:14] we're building on the words of a man
[1:28:16] amen
[1:28:18] well then you don't know what the Bible
[1:28:20] says the Bible says follow me Paul did
[1:28:23] as I thought I cry
[1:28:24] exactly what the Bible says
[1:28:32] when he says the white horse rider
[1:28:35] was the Holy Ghost
[1:28:38] then when he turned around and said he
[1:28:40] wouldn't have had it in the Antichrist
[1:28:42] we had to swap over with it all right
[1:28:44] absolutely but when he said it was the
[1:28:46] Holy Ghost that wasn't right we can't
[1:28:48] follow that
[1:28:50] even though that was the words of a man
[1:28:52] that had a great understanding and
[1:28:55] listened they was
[1:28:57] nobody in the world
[1:29:00] everybody understand what nobody means
[1:29:02] that means there ain't nobody
[1:29:05] it ain't the good word we're in the
[1:29:07] southern part we use that yeah
[1:29:09] that means nobody period
[1:29:12] nobody could correct her around
[1:29:15] first Larkin before brother Brown said
[1:29:18] to white horse rider was the Holy Ghost
[1:29:21] I mean was the Antichrist Murphy and
[1:29:25] it's right
[1:29:28] um but he wasn't a prophet
[1:29:32] he made a lucky guess
[1:29:36] or are a pre-figure of the truth
[1:29:40] and when brother Brown come out and said
[1:29:42] those things there's things he said that
[1:29:46] we know he corrected
[1:29:47] but if he didn't correct it
[1:29:50] there's no human mortal on Earth can
[1:29:52] correct the prophet that's right
[1:29:54] one because he's God's mouthpiece
[1:29:59] you understand what it says that in
[1:30:01] Hebrews there and has spoken to us in
[1:30:04] his son
[1:30:06] run around the Son of God
[1:30:09] and God spoke through that son
[1:30:12] brother colleges or Son of God God can
[1:30:16] come down and sleep through him to bring
[1:30:18] us the truth all right
[1:30:20] when are we going to accept it that way
[1:30:24] the prophet of God said it's the hardest
[1:30:26] thing in the world yet one man to
[1:30:27] believe enough
[1:30:28] this
[1:30:31] is true
[1:30:32] just order to get one man to believe you
[1:30:34] know
[1:30:36] I'm not asking you to believe me I never
[1:30:38] have asked my family I'll never ask my
[1:30:40] wife sitting there she can tell you you
[1:30:42] ask my kids I've never asked them to
[1:30:43] believe what I believe
[1:30:48] I asked them to do the same thing I
[1:30:50] asked the congregation to do
[1:30:54] and ask God if that's right
[1:30:58] it goes in that way you're not built on
[1:31:00] a man
[1:31:03] you're building on God's word
[1:31:06] and atonement Moses made with his own
[1:31:09] words
[1:31:12] and God looked down and says
[1:31:15] they got back off
[1:31:18] he goes over to the others as expression
[1:31:20] and he says
[1:31:22] it will be said Lord
[1:31:26] you know my brother brought around and
[1:31:27] said he said Moses was reminding God of
[1:31:32] his word he said that's what we must do
[1:31:36] remind him of his word
[1:31:40] at the words of a man
[1:31:43] you and I stand today
[1:31:47] very interest the other day very
[1:31:51] and I told the people before got to that
[1:31:54] point I said most of you standing here
[1:31:55] today
[1:31:57] oh your opportunity of Salvation to this
[1:32:00] man
[1:32:02] because that was back in the early days
[1:32:03] even the truck driver and even when they
[1:32:05] found out about right around me and we
[1:32:07] started driving he'd go through Indiana
[1:32:09] you know and stop over and pick up
[1:32:11] tables he didn't come back with me for a
[1:32:14] lot of churches didn't agree with it and
[1:32:16] and I know that they did it they'd sit
[1:32:18] in the school to tapes through the seeds
[1:32:19] to each other you know in the churches
[1:32:22] because they had been begin to some of
[1:32:24] them believe in the Reynolds prophets
[1:32:26] well
[1:32:28] see at the words of mine
[1:32:32] somebody
[1:32:34] helped you
[1:32:37] nobody guided you to Jesus Christ
[1:32:40] right
[1:32:43] somebody led us to the Lord some night
[1:32:47] that God used
[1:32:50] you said well can you use people he used
[1:32:52] Baylor
[1:32:54] and you know the veil of prophecies
[1:32:56] right here in this book
[1:32:59] he used Baylor
[1:33:00] by those prophecies right here written
[1:33:03] in the book
[1:33:06] he said well thank you much problems
[1:33:10] you used to dumb donkey to tell them
[1:33:12] bailand the truth
[1:33:15] he used a rooster to grow it could be
[1:33:18] right
[1:33:19] Peter what he said
[1:33:24] when I first heard of the message what
[1:33:25] about tears was a little problem but the
[1:33:28] the farthest part of believing one God
[1:33:30] no problem and I was toying with the
[1:33:33] point of the water baptism and I was in
[1:33:36] the Baptist church and we had a Baptist
[1:33:38] well thankfulness we were having a
[1:33:40] Revival and this guy came in and he
[1:33:42] preached and he preached all you do in
[1:33:44] the word me do all in the name of Jesus
[1:33:47] Christ
[1:33:48] that's it
[1:33:49] the people in the church they started
[1:33:51] praying in Jesus Christ but to me I went
[1:33:53] home and told Brother Moses I'm ready
[1:33:55] for the water
[1:33:58] because I've seen it
[1:34:01] all you do is worthy so God used the man
[1:34:06] to bring the truth
[1:34:10] but do we believe it today
[1:34:13] that's why you got a lot of people
[1:34:14] around the message today they're sitting
[1:34:16] home listening tapes
[1:34:18] they're in churches and by listening to
[1:34:21] the tables and things like that because
[1:34:24] they don't trust
[1:34:25] the thoughtful Ministries
[1:34:28] I didn't call myself
[1:34:31] God called me to the office I can call
[1:34:33] myself
[1:34:44] he said your non-spiritual gifts works
[1:34:46] in the church is not predestinated
[1:34:48] that's how much you separated
[1:34:52] but you see if God's Got A Deal
[1:34:56] I was preaching on Perfection into
[1:34:58] church perfect tonight
[1:35:00] even made the statement I said reverence
[1:35:03] said if if you got a question in your
[1:35:05] mind God will bring somebody on the pool
[1:35:07] if you didn't answer that question the
[1:35:09] brother walked in there and handed me a
[1:35:10] note and he wrote two or three weeks
[1:35:12] before then
[1:35:14] what's the difference in perfect
[1:35:15] imperfection
[1:35:17] I voted over there was the title of the
[1:35:20] circle
[1:35:26] he'll do it
[1:35:29] yes you said with them brother we
[1:35:31] believe everything you say nope I'm
[1:35:34] human
[1:35:36] but if I tell you God said
[1:35:39] you'd go to the bank because I'm not
[1:35:41] going to tell you until I know he said
[1:35:44] I can get a thought
[1:35:48] he'd be a good dog
[1:35:51] you know those 400 Prophets
[1:35:54] until we're facing there they had a good
[1:35:56] thought that's our man they're eating
[1:35:58] our food let's go get it
[1:36:03] good job
[1:36:06] but it wasn't what God Said
[1:36:09] so God said to the man said go on right
[1:36:11] yeah
[1:36:13] he said I saw you scared
[1:36:18] the Old King looked around there and he
[1:36:20] said put him in the prison and feed him
[1:36:23] the bread of water and the sorrow you
[1:36:26] know
[1:36:27] red water
[1:36:29] he said when I returned
[1:36:31] and I'll deal with you
[1:36:33] the old Prophet looked over at him he
[1:36:35] said
[1:36:36] if you return it all God didn't speak to
[1:36:40] me and you know what he didn't return
[1:36:46] to the words of a man
[1:36:51] you know that sister hey right couldn't
[1:36:53] couldn't totally grasp him evenly when
[1:36:56] brother Brown told her about her two
[1:36:58] boys
[1:37:00] she couldn't grasp it because that was a
[1:37:02] new part of his ministry where I say
[1:37:04] unto them
[1:37:05] see Jesus never did say to us in the
[1:37:07] Lord right
[1:37:09] show me the bible where jesus then said
[1:37:11] thus said the Lord now he was the Lord
[1:37:14] see what he said what I see him today
[1:37:16] right so wrote around and said to her I
[1:37:18] say unto thee I'll give you a boy and
[1:37:20] she must have evidently struggled a
[1:37:22] little bit about believing it totally
[1:37:23] because he turned around he said sister
[1:37:25] had it right back just saith the Lord
[1:37:28] yes she accepted
[1:37:31] but she knew when he said thus saith
[1:37:34] Lord yes he did it didn't get what to
[1:37:36] Ashley
[1:37:39] but your prophets would say thus saith
[1:37:41] the Lord
[1:37:43] but from Jesus up on this side
[1:37:46] he didn't have any time but around I had
[1:37:49] to come and show the ministry of the
[1:37:51] ministry of the Lord Jesus
[1:37:53] but he had to show it as a human bark so
[1:37:55] he would come and say he said that's
[1:37:57] thus saith the Lord
[1:38:02] you see one day it come to him to say
[1:38:04] I say under this time
[1:38:12] same word
[1:38:16] did he say
[1:38:18] he said when receivers broke the Bible
[1:38:19] become a brand new book
[1:38:21] that didn't become a different one
[1:38:23] though
[1:38:25] energy
[1:38:26] brand new book
[1:38:29] I said well I will become a new book to
[1:38:31] you
[1:38:32] not to see something different oh yeah
[1:38:35] and do so big ones that have done a
[1:38:37] virtue and all these other River Jordan
[1:38:39] they got the new book
[1:38:44] s
[1:38:45] we just remember
[1:38:49] there can't be something new that
[1:38:51] doesn't compare with the old all right
[1:38:56] if the old New Testament didn't compare
[1:38:58] with the Old Testament to show the same
[1:39:00] God it would be something wrong
[1:39:02] absolutely that's why I hear a book of
[1:39:04] Maccabees and all these lost books of
[1:39:07] Eden were not put in the Bible
[1:39:10] because they didn't compare
[1:39:15] what do you think about the words of a
[1:39:17] man
[1:39:20] because that man I'm talking about the
[1:39:22] Lord Jesus Christ
[1:39:25] the same one that spoke the world into
[1:39:27] existence
[1:39:29] the same one it's stood there and said
[1:39:31] unless you believe that I am he you will
[1:39:33] die in your sins
[1:39:35] the same one has come over here in the
[1:39:37] last days to speak through you and I
[1:39:43] speak and go forward
[1:39:48] pray for us at home we struggle we have
[1:39:50] our problems with everybody else
[1:39:54] you may have a small group but just
[1:39:56] remember when you get a bigger group you
[1:39:58] got bigger problem
[1:40:03] I never had no problem with it I don't
[1:40:05] never complain about my job I just do
[1:40:07] the job right amen I just tell them I
[1:40:09] said if you don't like the way I do it
[1:40:11] the first day of January you just vote
[1:40:13] you another preacher again you know take
[1:40:15] care of that I'm out of trouble yes
[1:40:23] but it's a word for money
[1:40:26] listen to the preachers that preached to
[1:40:28] him
[1:40:29] and see if in comparison to the Bible
[1:40:31] that's right she's the comparison of the
[1:40:33] Prophet speech amen
[1:40:36] now I have a little abundant I've always
[1:40:38] told people the name say well who are
[1:40:40] you but if you don't listen to what I'm
[1:40:42] saying you know the way I check a doctor
[1:40:45] now see where to write or not
[1:40:47] is not public quotes
[1:40:50] they can give you program Enterprise
[1:41:00] if you tell me something that the Bible
[1:41:03] said is contrary to the way that I got
[1:41:05] born again I can't accept it
[1:41:09] and that's how sure I am about my new
[1:41:12] birth
[1:41:14] that my new birth is always compared
[1:41:17] with the Bible
[1:41:19] and I was two years in this message you
[1:41:22] know said last night before I in any
[1:41:25] ways that I had the baptism when I would
[1:41:27] have done
[1:41:28] I didn't say it just because I come into
[1:41:30] the message and I left the Baptist and I
[1:41:32] could tell you what the prophet said
[1:41:37] but one day something happened
[1:41:41] I had a new birth
[1:41:43] how do I read murder transformation
[1:41:47] to see if it's compared for money or
[1:41:54] if they don't compare there's something
[1:41:55] wrong maybe it's me I said
[1:42:00] with my new birth
[1:42:03] so did I say last night what is the new
[1:42:06] word Christ in you
[1:42:13] the hope of glory
[1:42:17] mankind down through time in Heavenly
[1:42:20] hope of a change in the body they've all
[1:42:22] called we're going to get us a music
[1:42:23] that's right you see then when this
[1:42:26] Prophet came it began to change
[1:42:28] and Mankind even today and even
[1:42:31] well-known preachers in this Mission are
[1:42:34] still saying that we're going to get us
[1:42:36] a new body
[1:42:38] well I can't understand that
[1:42:41] when I read in the Bible that Jesus said
[1:42:43] they originally raised if anybody would
[1:42:46] do a new one it would have been me and
[1:42:48] wouldn't it
[1:42:50] oh no we'll take it now Hallelujah
[1:42:53] that's the only thing he retained
[1:42:57] if you saw Jesus today with blood all
[1:42:59] over him
[1:43:01] in a male Prince and all in his head and
[1:43:04] I tell you you didn't see Jesus
[1:43:09] because he only retained the one thing
[1:43:13] the nail prints in his hands and I
[1:43:16] believe when we get to Glory he'll still
[1:43:19] have it right
[1:43:22] because that would always be there to
[1:43:24] remind me
[1:43:26] of my salvation
[1:43:27] let's stand together well back on these
[1:43:30] things pray for our ship home
[1:43:33] good evening we need the Lord
[1:43:37] appreciate you putting up with us
[1:43:40] sitting and listening yes in a good
[1:43:43] contradiction as I said last night
[1:43:45] I've preached in big churches
[1:43:48] and I feel no more the spirit of God
[1:43:50] than us without fear factor
[1:43:53] of this spirit of God being within a
[1:43:56] little group
[1:43:57] little thing of talking about the Lord
[1:43:59] and fellowshipping and thank you
[1:44:02] we see I know the people here
[1:44:05] I'm looking at a Congregation of 500 not
[1:44:08] on the one in the world should I
[1:44:11] but I know most of you is probably all
[1:44:13] of your life just about it facing the
[1:44:15] kids tonight

[1:46:41] look at how much it is

[1:46:46] reason we left this message here

[1:46:51] there you know he's not here no more
[1:46:54] he's left us here
[1:46:57] but you know if we can sing for God to
[1:46:59] save through that prophet I could ever
[1:47:02] see that and leave it in our hearts and
[1:47:05] notice God seek God that it was God that
[1:47:08] word that message
