[19:24] somebody here's got a testimony
[19:29] amen
[19:34] sorry about that
[19:36] sometimes you do things when you think
[19:38] you're called to do it
[19:40] and you find out
[19:41] it's not necessarily so
[19:44] amen i'd like to make this commitment
[19:48] that you know we get so busy this time
[19:50] of the year with
[19:52] shopping and and trying to do all the
[19:54] things that it's ex you know that we
[19:57] need to be doing
[19:58] but i found out
[20:00] at my age you have to live a life maybe
[20:02] the most important thing
[20:05] at christmas or any other time in this
[20:07] year if the year is your family
[20:09] make sure that you love your family
[20:13] that that's all that counts when you get
[20:15] down to this age basically is your
[20:17] relationship to jesus christ and your
[20:19] relationship to your family
[20:21] and i thank god for my family things
[20:23] have not always been perfect and they
[20:25] probably won't be until the rapture but
[20:28] i thank god for my family my children
[20:31] and and the relationship that we have
[20:33] with the people here at this church my
[20:35] brothers and sisters and brother sam and
[20:37] sister peggy what they've meant in our
[20:39] lives
[20:40] and
[20:41] that's my testimony
[20:44] man that said something to brother ray a
[20:45] while ago
[20:46] hadn't fulfilled it as a vietnam war
[20:48] well four nights overnight
[20:51] but you know we on the internet and we
[20:52] on
[20:54] on facebook
[20:56] and if we get an opportunity to use a
[20:59] camcorder or something like that you
[21:00] need to sit down
[21:02] and just give a testimony
[21:05] and put it on youtube
[21:08] and put it on that thing right there
[21:11] there's people out there that they have
[21:13] no idea what's going on
[21:15] but they'd love to hear it from you amen
[21:19] number d and b

[23:19] made and keep all these things in mind
[23:22] you know we had asked the people if they
[23:24] wanted to services coming wednesday and

[23:28] limbo so we decided just go ahead and
[23:29] have a service this coming wednesday
[23:32] and then who wants to come can come
[23:35] because that'll be the day after
[23:36] christmas

[23:39] understand but we'll just go ahead for
[23:41] whatever wants to be here and then we'll
[23:44] have the service but then there won't be
[23:45] any service here on january the 2nd
[23:48] on wednesday january the 2nd there will
[23:51] not be one because we'll be having to

[25:20] guide each and every one
[25:22] lead us in jesus name amen
[25:25] amen
[25:27] revelations
[25:29] one verse one
[25:31] the revelation of jesus christ which god
[25:33] gave unto him
[25:35] showing to his servants things which
[25:37] must shortly come to pass
[25:39] and he sent and signified it by his
[25:40] angel and to his servant john
[25:43] by record of the word of god and the
[25:45] testimony of jesus christ
[25:47] and of all things that he saw
[25:49] blessed is he that readeth and they that
[25:51] hear the words of this prophecy and keep
[25:53] those things which are written therein
[25:55] for the time is at hand
[25:58] all right we're going out to revelation
[26:00] 8 1
[26:03] and then when he had opened the seventh
[26:05] seal there was silence in heaven
[26:08] about the space of half an hour you may
[26:11] be seated
[26:12] look at his blessing to the
[26:15] reading of the word
[26:17] now
[26:20] we have spent a lot of time getting up
[26:22] to where we are
[26:24] and you know
[26:27] trying to express some things and to
[26:30] walk into the light of the
[26:32] evening message
[26:34] but i hope you thought caught what i was
[26:36] doing this morning
[26:39] is putting all of the emphasis we could
[26:42] upon the fact that
[26:45] we have had a messenger in the end time
[26:49] to bring us the word of the lord
[26:52] and so that these things could be
[26:54] revealed
[26:55] but now watch it we're going along this
[26:57] afternoon
[26:59] see then
[27:00] we're dependent upon the word coming to
[27:03] the prophet
[27:04] america now
[27:06] as it would be
[27:08] uh coming to the prophet to reveal
[27:11] see then uh even the written word
[27:16] even the written word now there were
[27:18] some things that could be remain known
[27:20] and etc and all
[27:22] but the written word
[27:24] the mysteries
[27:25] would come to the prophet
[27:28] and we could you know see it because of
[27:30] that
[27:31] and have it understand it
[27:33] but then if there's anything else in
[27:35] there
[27:36] it would have to come by way of the
[27:38] prophet
[27:39] now i do not believe
[27:42] that
[27:43] uh brother brown could bring us anything
[27:45] contrary to the word
[27:47] and i do not believe that he come to add
[27:49] to the word
[27:51] that's the emphasis we're going to be
[27:53] putting on
[27:54] the whole thing all the way through in
[27:56] the case i forget to say it
[27:58] over and over
[27:59] the emphasis upon the opening of the
[28:01] seventh seal
[28:04] if i believe it's written amen
[28:08] you know that's what i was trying to
[28:10] express this morning
[28:11] when you say that the seventh seal was
[28:14] open
[28:15] in their silence in heaven all right now
[28:18] you say it's nothing now
[28:22] right where would be your thought
[28:27] if it was nothing it would just be
[28:30] nothing
[28:32] the prophet couldn't reveal it
[28:35] if it's nothing
[28:39] and see it's not that the
[28:43] you can't do the seals going through the
[28:45] word
[28:46] you know and then all it once you come
[28:47] up to something that
[28:49] not even written at all that's true okay
[28:52] because there's no writing there of
[28:53] telling what it is
[28:56] but if we're dependent upon the
[28:59] and we must be upon the prophets of god
[29:03] throughout the bible
[29:06] to be bringing us
[29:08] the thought of god
[29:11] you know
[29:13] to where that we can understand what god
[29:15] has for you and i
[29:17] like brother random explaining in the
[29:19] seal book about
[29:22] first it was god's thought
[29:26] i said did it become moses's thought
[29:28] right
[29:30] now he said it like this he said it's
[29:31] not the word yeah
[29:35] see because it hadn't been spoken right
[29:37] it was a thought given to the prophet
[29:39] right now
[29:41] see then the prophet gets the thought
[29:43] and then the prophet goes forth and
[29:45] speaks it
[29:46] now it's become the word
[29:49] name that you can listen to and
[29:51] understand
[29:52] all right now in no way will we be
[29:55] covering the seventh seal
[29:58] in the basis of
[30:02] trying to add something to the word
[30:05] but i don't believe the prophet could
[30:06] add anything to the word right right
[30:10] but he could bring us the thoughts of
[30:12] god yes from god's mind delivered down
[30:15] to you and i amen
[30:17] all right
[30:18] now
[30:19] see it's thought by a lot of people that
[30:21] run around and told us this that or the
[30:23] other that
[30:24] the bible don't tell us now
[30:27] i can't go that way i'm sorry
[30:30] i'm sorry i i you know that sounds good
[30:34] but it's i don't believe it's true right
[30:38] because see when it just said they
[30:39] silence in heaven
[30:42] that means there's something there
[30:45] right
[30:46] or they wouldn't be the silence
[30:51] and if it's just silence itself that
[30:53] would still be something
[30:56] so you wouldn't be adding what the
[30:58] prophet would do he'd say and if we get
[31:00] to it this morning i mean this evening i
[31:02] doubt it but he said this is my
[31:04] revelation of it i had the revelation
[31:06] that revealed come on all right
[31:09] then it's not going to be something
[31:11] added to the word right but remember
[31:14] they kept telling him with your ability
[31:17] you could write a 23rd chapter of
[31:19] revelation
[31:20] he said they were trying to trap me
[31:21] right he tricked me he said because you
[31:24] king head too
[31:25] the thunders cannot be added to the word
[31:29] it must be what is in the word amen
[31:32] seals cannot be added to the word
[31:35] it is what's in the word
[31:38] that should be the simple point of our
[31:39] understanding
[31:41] and we base everything then upon
[31:45] we have
[31:48] the bible
[31:50] and we have the prophet's
[31:52] message
[31:54] telling us what the bible is saying
[31:58] so what what do we have to worry about
[32:01] you know
[32:03] right why try to think about something
[32:05] added that's right
[32:07] there's no added revelation right right
[32:12] you you'll find out we'll get to it
[32:14] because it'll be wednesday or
[32:16] sometime next year
[32:19] we'll find the seventh seal that
[32:20] probably tells you what it is
[32:23] he said it's the end of all times
[32:25] right what
[32:28] if it's the end of all things
[32:32] then the end of all things is to sell
[32:33] itself
[32:35] so you
[32:36] my point of view the next few messages
[32:38] is driving down some things
[32:41] that are said
[32:43] about this seventh seal
[32:45] that will be putting us to the bases
[32:47] that we can see
[32:49] that there is something there
[32:54] and it must be revealed
[32:57] if not the prophet wouldn't have said
[32:58] anything that's right right
[33:02] you say well i just can't follow that
[33:04] because well
[33:06] that's true because of our thinking
[33:08] that's right because our minds are
[33:10] locked into certain channels that's
[33:12] right and if we don't
[33:14] uh open up those channels
[33:17] then our minds will stay that way
[33:20] and we're headed to the grave
[33:23] but we're trying to bring the point this
[33:24] morning of what
[33:26] what did we
[33:27] do in each one of the seals as we came
[33:30] down
[33:32] we're trying to cover the point of
[33:35] to see what was dire yeah
[33:38] and you know see what's made known as
[33:40] symbol or
[33:41] people or whatever
[33:44] but at the same time to see
[33:49] what is that revealing to you and i
[33:51] that's right
[33:52] see that's what people would say you
[33:54] know well what's this sixth seal got to
[33:56] do with me that's relation
[34:00] well
[34:01] that's true
[34:03] but then
[34:04] in that is the plan of redemption
[34:08] amen and that's what is to be to you and
[34:10] i right amen the plan of redemption amen
[34:13] all right then we got down to the end
[34:15] this morning talking about
[34:18] how that the whole world is groaning and
[34:20] waiting
[34:22] on
[34:23] you and i yes right
[34:27] everything is dependent upon whether or
[34:29] not you and i
[34:31] can receive
[34:33] what this prophet has broughted to us
[34:36] and not put our own interpretations upon
[34:39] it
[34:40] but to see what the word has to say
[34:45] there's a lot of beautiful things that
[34:46] we can take but
[34:48] when you bring it back and say well tell
[34:50] me what the scripture says
[34:53] that's right
[34:54] that puts a
[34:56] damper
[34:57] on a lot of people's
[34:58] doctrines right because they know they
[35:00] can't bring it through the scriptures
[35:02] right right right and they're really
[35:04] they're not interested in bringing it
[35:05] through they're just
[35:06] interested in a following a group or
[35:09] doings and and that's that's going to be
[35:12] going away so that'll be all right
[35:16] but now
[35:20] get what we were trying to bring
[35:23] this morning and then we'll get up to
[35:24] the point
[35:27] it says a silence in heaven
[35:29] for about the space of half an hour
[35:33] all right
[35:34] now
[35:36] there had to be a reason for that
[35:38] silence
[35:41] something caused that silence
[35:44] to take place
[35:48] and in doing that then
[35:50] we can look at it and see
[35:52] that
[35:56] as i say it this morning right at the
[35:58] end
[36:00] see that there's been silence in heaven
[36:02] for two thousand years
[36:04] he said no no no brother dale you
[36:06] misquote that call brother i said this
[36:08] okay that's what we gave this morning
[36:11] he said this is what taken place in
[36:13] glory
[36:14] some two thousand years ago
[36:16] paragraph 43 and the seventh seal
[36:21] there are silence in heaven
[36:25] all right
[36:26] now it didn't say silence on earth
[36:30] right it's all about heaven
[36:34] the basics of dealing with the first six
[36:37] seals
[36:38] you deal with earthly time yes
[36:42] uh
[36:43] some of it may still yet to be the
[36:44] tribulation you know the difference
[36:47] but it's still earthly things yes
[36:51] all right
[36:52] but we find here that it says silence in
[36:54] heaven
[36:57] okay
[36:58] now
[36:59] something had to cause that to take
[37:02] place
[37:05] and i believe that's what the prophet
[37:06] explained to us
[37:10] i ended up making a statement i'm sure
[37:13] was strange to some
[37:16] when i said to the whole seven seals
[37:22] is silence we'll get back later and
[37:24] prove where the prophet of god said
[37:27] those angels bring me back here for the
[37:29] message tonight
[37:31] and he'll stop talking about city you
[37:33] think see about it all this week
[37:35] something going on
[37:37] see there those seals
[37:39] you said where the first seal was broke
[37:45] it was broken in heaven
[37:50] it doesn't say that it was broke on
[37:52] earth
[37:54] revelations 4 john is taken up
[38:00] revelations 4 and revelations 5 is in
[38:03] heaven
[38:06] revelation 6
[38:08] what happens under that seal
[38:11] is on earth
[38:13] yes
[38:15] but the seal itself is broken heaven
[38:20] that's where the silences are
[38:24] we don't get to it this evening we'll
[38:25] get to it later
[38:27] see the silence is there because brother
[38:29] run said
[38:30] if there was one movement
[38:33] it might give away the secret
[38:36] amen
[38:37] he said this is something satan don't
[38:39] know
[38:40] right now
[38:41] say don't know anything about the seals
[38:43] whatsoever
[38:46] did you
[38:48] before you heard of the prophet
[38:51] yeah boy let's go and i had this all
[38:53] figured yeah you had it all figured out
[38:55] yeah
[38:58] i heard of the church ages before i
[39:00] heard of the prophet
[39:02] and the guy had some of the things in
[39:03] the correct order
[39:05] but he couldn't fit it all together
[39:08] all right
[39:10] but you see if something took place in
[39:12] glory 2 000 years ago
[39:14] i want to know what that was
[39:20] what caused that silence yes
[39:26] something had to take place
[39:30] all right
[39:35] you say yeah but we there's no way for
[39:36] us to understand well
[39:38] there's where the prophet comes in see
[39:43] he can tell us these things that's right
[39:47] and then we can just take what he says
[39:49] and just
[39:50] go right on and wait for god to reveal
[39:54] although it took place in glory 2 000
[39:56] years ago
[39:58] it didn't mean it was done
[40:01] right that's where we're looking at it
[40:03] what is revelation 4 and 5
[40:09] was john
[40:10] taken up
[40:13] into heaven
[40:18] or was he taken up to see heaven
[40:21] which was
[40:28] see if we look at it and say well okay
[40:33] we've got to depend on the profit
[40:36] all right then let's go back now
[40:39] and deal with this a little bit as we're
[40:41] thinking
[40:42] i know i was very slow this morning i
[40:44] want to be slow
[40:46] because i want you to think
[40:50] about the things
[40:52] all right
[40:54] first off when john starts out
[41:02] he was not up in heaven
[41:06] he was on patents
[41:08] right right
[41:09] all right
[41:11] so we go to
[41:12] number five and we'll start from there
[41:18] whoever number five on the quote but it
[41:20] is revelation 1 10.
[41:23] and john was in the spirit
[41:25] on the lord's day
[41:28] he didn't say he was in heaven
[41:32] he saw a lot of things
[41:36] throughout chapter one
[41:38] throughout chapter two
[41:40] and chapter three
[41:43] john saw a lot of things right
[41:46] and wrote about it the church ages and
[41:48] the things yes
[41:51] right
[41:52] but then in revelations 4 1
[41:56] he was taken up to heaven
[42:00] the main thing he covers and i was in
[42:03] the spirit
[42:04] because that's what he said over here in
[42:05] revelation 1 10 i was in the spirit of
[42:07] the lord's day
[42:09] now in verse two in the fourth chapter
[42:11] he's in the spirit
[42:13] and you begin to see things
[42:16] all right
[42:18] now my point of what i'm saying did john
[42:21] go up
[42:24] no he was laid on patents with me
[42:27] his body was probably laying under a
[42:29] tree somewhere and he was taking things
[42:31] over because
[42:32] actually the book of revelations
[42:35] you could read it in what maybe 10
[42:37] minutes
[42:38] if you read real fast maybe 20 say you
[42:41] took 30 on
[42:44] but john is there
[42:46] for about two years
[42:51] on the isle of family
[42:53] so it's not one of those things that he
[42:55] was taken up to heaven and you just no
[43:01] was he mortally taken up
[43:07] i asked that question for you to
[43:08] consider
[43:10] was he taken up in a mortal body
[43:16] or was he taken up as brother branham
[43:18] was
[43:19] when he went beyond the curtain of time
[43:24] when paul said that he went to the third
[43:26] heaven
[43:27] was he taken mortally you know what i
[43:29] mean mortal mortal mortal body
[43:32] this
[43:34] 16 elements flesh
[43:36] or was he in the spirit
[43:40] all right so we got that established
[43:42] right
[43:44] john was not a physical translation into
[43:46] heaven
[43:52] someday that'll be valuable to you
[43:57] paul was not physically taken up brother
[43:59] was not physically he looked back his
[44:01] body was laying on his bed
[44:05] all right
[44:06] so is this
[44:08] a physical happening of john no
[44:12] corporal no right
[44:16] because of what he saw there
[44:20] and the things he saw would be future
[44:22] things
[44:27] you and i wasn't in heaven
[44:29] when john
[44:31] went up
[44:35] right right
[44:37] so he's going up to see the future right
[44:42] are you following me
[44:45] you're going up to see the future
[44:48] so he's not in a corporal physical meant
[44:51] a mortal translation
[45:01] they called it souls under the altar
[45:04] for
[45:07] the prophet
[45:09] you know when he said the angel lord or
[45:11] they told him it's a soldier under the
[45:13] altar
[45:16] paul he said well i don't know where it
[45:18] was in body or out of body because he
[45:19] was honest he didn't know
[45:23] but he didn't go there physically
[45:28] because he went there physically that
[45:30] would mean you and i have to be there
[45:31] physically
[45:34] that simple
[45:35] yes
[45:36] that need a lot of revelation to figure
[45:38] that out
[45:40] no it just means
[45:42] it's what it is
[45:44] all right so when he went up
[45:50] he was able to see then
[45:53] what took place in glory
[45:57] okay is that what the prophet said this
[45:59] morning we were reading paragraph 43
[46:02] take a place in glory some 2 000 years
[46:04] ago
[46:06] all right
[46:09] that means it's 2 000 years before we
[46:11] get there
[46:14] right
[46:16] i mean if it's two thousand years ago we
[46:18] ain't there yet that's sensible
[46:22] all right now
[46:25] there will be a time when we'll be there
[46:31] but we're not there yet
[46:35] okay
[46:36] we're heading that way
[46:41] so then john
[46:44] wasn't over here
[46:48] looking back over there
[46:52] right that's right
[46:55] john was back there looking up now
[47:03] and as he was he was seeing
[47:05] things that would eventually take place
[47:09] that's why it's the top of the rapture
[47:12] see john wasn't taken up physically
[47:14] it was the top of the rapture right
[47:17] all right
[47:19] so john went up to heaven
[47:24] and we
[47:26] by way of the prophet
[47:28] are the ones dealing with what took
[47:30] place 2 000 years ago in glory
[47:34] that's why i said this morning
[47:38] it be a surprise to deal with
[47:40] all seven seals
[47:44] and the silence in heaven for all of the
[47:45] seven seals
[47:48] because at the time john saw that even
[47:51] in his day
[47:53] the seals were not even in physical
[47:55] manifestation upon the earth
[47:59] right
[48:00] all right
[48:03] all right
[48:07] john then
[48:11] sees
[48:13] the throne
[48:16] one sitting on the throne
[48:18] the 24 elders
[48:21] need all kind of things that he sees
[48:24] that will be future
[48:28] in manifestation
[48:30] all right
[48:33] but he sees the breaking of the seals
[48:36] right
[48:38] he sees the lamb coming forth and
[48:41] taking the book
[48:45] now you might not have thought what i
[48:47] did this morning on it but did any of us
[48:49] know anything about these things before
[48:51] the prophet come to tell us
[48:53] so it's been been 2 000 years of silence
[49:03] until it was revealed to the prophet it
[49:05] was silent
[49:12] sure we know that there were many things
[49:14] throughout the first six seals that
[49:16] transpire on earth
[49:22] and if we get to it in time we're going
[49:23] to find out that there were some things
[49:26] transpired in earth
[49:28] under the seventh seal
[49:32] that made
[49:34] the silence in heaven
[49:41] well we're just studying it by what the
[49:44] prophet said took place
[49:47] all right
[49:48] we won't try to go into what our
[49:49] thoughts are
[49:51] we'll just deal with it to what he said
[49:57] but we read one this morning a quote
[49:59] where brother around said that the seals
[50:01] was broke
[50:02] and given to john
[50:09] now even though you're dealing with the
[50:11] seals of revelation 6
[50:19] there's a few things we better deal with
[50:20] with revelations 10
[50:23] because the book is sealed
[50:28] the first mention of it being fully open
[50:31] is revelations 10.
[50:34] all right
[50:36] it doesn't mention in revelation 6.
[50:40] or 8 1
[50:44] that the book was opened
[50:48] it's in the process of being opened
[50:52] revelation 10 it says it's open
[50:55] all right
[50:59] john was to record what he saw
[51:03] what was his reason
[51:05] john
[51:06] you go you see you write you take write
[51:10] it down
[51:11] you bring it back to the church right
[51:15] is that over about chapter one
[51:19] okay
[51:20] so that's why i love to quote from the
[51:22] prophet
[51:23] the way he says things
[51:25] look what he says here on paragraph 299
[51:27] number seven of the notes on the breach
[51:31] look what happens
[51:35] talk about a jubilee
[51:38] talk about a jubilee when that lamb
[51:40] walked forth
[51:42] see the books even sealed in heaven
[51:49] the book was sealed in heaven
[51:54] it's going to have to come open in
[51:56] heaven
[51:57] before it can come open on earth
[52:02] okay
[52:06] see the book sealed in heaven
[52:09] the mysteries are
[52:11] that's what he said
[52:12] say is my name there i don't know i hope
[52:15] it is
[52:16] but if it is it was put on the book
[52:18] before the foundation world right but
[52:20] the first thing that represented that
[52:22] redemption
[52:25] come the lamb that had been slain from
[52:27] the foundation of the world
[52:33] and he took the book glory opened the
[52:35] book and tore off the seals
[52:40] watched it
[52:41] and sent it down to the
[52:44] earth to his seventh angel to reveal to
[52:47] his people
[52:50] in heaven
[52:51] name dropping the earth
[52:54] first it was given to john right
[52:56] write it down john
[52:59] the book is sealed
[53:01] it has to be brought to earth to be
[53:03] revealed right there you are what
[53:06] happened the strings were shouting the
[53:08] glory the anointings
[53:10] and old john had been standing there our
[53:13] brother crying why he said everything in
[53:15] heaven everything in earth
[53:17] and everything in the sea
[53:19] heard me hollering
[53:21] you say well that don't sound like
[53:22] silence
[53:27] why not
[53:29] he hasn't told any secrets yet
[53:32] he hasn't told why he's hollering
[53:40] right
[53:42] that's in chapter 5 right
[53:46] chapter 5 is where john
[53:48] is hollering
[53:56] he doesn't know anything at all
[53:59] except one thing
[54:03] the lamb took the book
[54:08] he knows the lamb has got the book
[54:11] and he knows the lamb is worthy chapter
[54:14] five yes
[54:17] he knows he's capable of doing it
[54:20] yes
[54:21] he's already rejoicing before he learns
[54:24] one thing amen come on read your bible
[54:27] chapter 5.
[54:35] the book is still sealed up until you
[54:37] start in chapter six
[54:40] verse one and it says in the lamb broke
[54:42] the first seal
[54:46] but it's handed down to the prophet
[54:49] so without him we wouldn't know these
[54:51] things
[54:53] and sent down to the earth to be
[54:55] revealed to the
[54:56] people you and i
[54:59] all right
[55:00] so now even though the seal is broken in
[55:03] heaven
[55:07] did that take place when two thousand
[55:09] years ago
[55:10] right
[55:14] come on
[55:16] two thousand years ago
[55:19] seen in heaven with the lamb taking the
[55:21] boat that's right that's right
[55:23] but was any of that revealed
[55:29] so it's indefinitely been for 2000 years
[55:34] a silence
[55:40] in heaven
[55:42] yes my brother there let me show all the
[55:44] time you're talking
[55:48] thousand years a day and a day of a
[55:50] thousand years
[55:53] what i said this morning everybody's
[55:54] trying to count figure out how long that
[55:57] 30 minutes of silence is why don't you
[55:59] count how long that 30 minutes of
[56:00] silence he's in heaven
[56:04] with no record of days times or beings
[56:07] or minutes or hours
[56:13] everyone says see there two thousand
[56:16] years he said that's only been two days
[56:19] he said god is just getting up
[56:22] you know he don't mean getting out of
[56:23] bed
[56:27] he's standing up
[56:30] getting ready to do something
[56:31] right and 2 000 years later he does it
[56:36] you see amen
[56:39] but we try to figure all these things
[56:40] out
[56:43] with our intellectual abilities
[56:47] how long
[56:50] is two thousand years in glory
[56:55] john said about the space a half hour
[57:04] the seals broke in glory two thousand
[57:06] years ago all seven of them
[57:10] but they wasn't revealed
[57:13] until 63
[57:16] to the prophet that's right
[57:18] come on
[57:20] so he's been silenced
[57:22] yes
[57:24] no you have time to get to it so i'll go
[57:25] ahead and stir it up where you can think
[57:27] a little
[57:28] see the reason there's silence in heaven
[57:29] it may give away the secret of
[57:31] redemption
[57:34] right amen
[57:38] that's what your prophet said
[57:43] all right he can't give away that secret
[57:45] of redemption
[57:46] and when was redemption to be brought
[57:48] forth to you and i
[57:52] 1963 through a little prophet right
[57:57] began to reveal
[58:00] brought it down to his angel to reveal 2
[58:03] 000 years between
[58:05] the taking of the book
[58:07] and they're bringing it to the prophet
[58:14] so they've been silenced in heaven
[58:17] yes amen
[58:22] see the prophet of god then would have
[58:24] the ability
[58:27] to be able to look back
[58:30] in this
[58:32] 2000 years
[58:35] to see what went on in glory
[58:39] right right
[58:41] he now the ability to look back before
[58:43] the foundation of the world
[58:45] well that's what he said on christ the
[58:46] mystery god revealed
[58:53] john in his early life in the early part
[58:56] of patmos he saw many many things for
[58:59] three whole chapters
[59:01] then he's taken up
[59:06] he goes through chapter four chapter
[59:08] five
[59:09] then he finally comes to chapter six
[59:12] then he goes through chapter seven
[59:14] writing down
[59:16] and he goes to chapter 8.
[59:23] chapter 5 we find
[59:27] the lamb
[59:29] had to take the book
[59:31] out of the hand of the one sitting on
[59:32] the throne
[59:37] the prophet of god said it this way
[59:42] he said he came from behind the throne
[59:46] where he's been making intercession
[59:51] he said he takes a book climbs up on the
[59:53] throne and sits down
[1:00:01] see that's the one that's worthy to open
[1:00:04] the book
[1:00:06] the lamb which is jesus christ
[1:00:08] see it would give away the secret
[1:00:12] of redemption
[1:00:14] not just the secret of the seventh seal
[1:00:21] it would give away the secret of the
[1:00:23] whole plan of redemption
[1:00:29] not just the seventh seal
[1:00:32] all seven seals
[1:00:36] would be sealed up until the end time
[1:00:41] he said but there was only silence in
[1:00:43] heaven under the seventh seal
[1:00:45] we'll get back to that one
[1:00:47] so i'd write that down you know
[1:00:49] so he said he's gonna explain this one
[1:00:51] day
[1:00:56] do we know anything about these things
[1:00:57] or did we know anything about them until
[1:00:59] a prophet came
[1:01:02] she would give away the secret
[1:01:10] you can't do that back there
[1:01:12] see satan for 2 000 years
[1:01:16] he's been trying to find out what took
[1:01:18] place in glory 2 000 years ago
[1:01:26] he's been trying to find some way to
[1:01:28] destroy
[1:01:30] that plan of redemption
[1:01:36] the seals remember reveal what has been
[1:01:38] what is and will be
[1:01:41] so they reveal the redemption of the
[1:01:43] body spirit and soul
[1:01:46] not just for the body
[1:01:49] that's the climax
[1:01:57] he said i don't know about that go ahead
[1:01:58] and number eight
[1:02:02] nobody said on the breach
[1:02:06] 46 8-49
[1:02:09] now notice the seven seals hold the
[1:02:11] mystery of the book
[1:02:16] now read whitney
[1:02:19] until we see what those seven seals are
[1:02:21] sealed in
[1:02:24] we're only presuming
[1:02:31] now he didn't say until we see or when
[1:02:35] we see six of the seals
[1:02:38] i want you to read
[1:02:42] he said until we see what those seven
[1:02:45] seals
[1:02:47] have sealed in
[1:02:50] we're only presuming
[1:02:55] they break six seals
[1:02:57] you know what
[1:03:02] unless you sell it's open you're only
[1:03:04] presuming
[1:03:09] simple thoughts
[1:03:11] because if i told you this morning the
[1:03:13] format of the message of the
[1:03:15] in clinton bc
[1:03:17] we are sure to miss the thing unless
[1:03:18] it's absolutely generalized revealed by
[1:03:20] the holy spirit and vindicated the same
[1:03:22] see if the prophet rises and tells you
[1:03:24] that this
[1:03:26] that this is just that and god don't
[1:03:28] vindicate the thing forget it
[1:03:31] but god in every statement
[1:03:34] and and everything has to vindicate it
[1:03:37] to make it right let's see all right his
[1:03:39] children will watch those things
[1:03:42] all right
[1:03:44] notice the seventh seal on the book has
[1:03:47] the the seven seals has the book sealed
[1:03:54] the book is absolutely
[1:03:57] do you see it
[1:03:59] the book is absolutely sealed
[1:04:02] i see a book until the seven seals is
[1:04:04] broke
[1:04:06] it's sealed with seven seals
[1:04:10] you say well you spent a message talking
[1:04:12] about six seals six seals revealing
[1:04:14] redemption seven still don't reveal
[1:04:16] redemption
[1:04:20] seven seal is the end of redemption it
[1:04:22] doesn't reveal it
[1:04:25] now watch it now that's a different from
[1:04:27] the seventh undersea
[1:04:28] this is seven sealed on the book in a
[1:04:30] book well the seals will not be released
[1:04:34] until the message of the seventh angel
[1:04:38] you agree with that amen all right
[1:04:41] so there's 2 000 years between there and
[1:04:43] over here
[1:04:44] okay
[1:04:46] see so we we are presuming
[1:04:50] now people that say the seventh seal is
[1:04:52] not broken
[1:04:57] then you're presuming right
[1:05:02] sorry about that i'm just reading what
[1:05:03] he said
[1:05:05] but the real genuine but the genuine
[1:05:08] revelation
[1:05:09] of god we made perfect in that sounding
[1:05:11] and vindicated truth now that's exactly
[1:05:13] what the word says and the sea of the
[1:05:15] book is single it's closed
[1:05:17] look
[1:05:19] it's closed here in revelations the 5th
[1:05:21] chapter
[1:05:24] in revelations the 10th chapter
[1:05:26] it is open
[1:05:28] he said we want to see how it gets
[1:05:29] opened
[1:05:31] all right
[1:05:33] now
[1:05:34] but it's just
[1:05:37] silence for the deal
[1:05:39] there's nothing
[1:05:46] remember all of the seals there's in
[1:05:48] symbols a reality but the seventh seal
[1:05:51] is not a symbol
[1:05:57] but what about this thing
[1:06:04] 77 seventh seal
[1:06:07] and the eighth chapter only reveals a
[1:06:09] scene
[1:06:11] of
[1:06:12] the scene of the seventh seal
[1:06:14] where nothing else is revealed now
[1:06:18] nothing is not revealed in the seventh
[1:06:19] seal
[1:06:21] now it has nothing to do with the
[1:06:22] seventh chapter of revelation it's the
[1:06:25] revealing of the seventh seal is
[1:06:26] perfectly mute
[1:06:29] but he said it's the scene
[1:06:34] he said if i would have time i'll try a
[1:06:36] few places to show you all the way back
[1:06:39] from genesis this seventh chapter this
[1:06:42] seventh seal is spoke of
[1:06:45] now am i right then what i was saying
[1:06:47] while ago
[1:06:50] do you remember what i was saying to
[1:06:51] start with
[1:06:55] that all of the secrets of the bible
[1:06:58] come to the prophets
[1:07:03] and that the seventh seal to the prophet
[1:07:05] couldn't add anything to the bible
[1:07:13] come on
[1:07:14] would you back there with me a while ago
[1:07:19] seven seal can't add anything to the
[1:07:21] bible
[1:07:23] it's got to be what's in the bible
[1:07:26] so now we see
[1:07:30] that it's a scene
[1:07:31] we're in heaven
[1:07:36] so now we've got it being something
[1:07:39] if you couldn't follow the silence one
[1:07:41] ago you got it being something it's a
[1:07:43] scene
[1:07:47] and it spoke off from genesis so that
[1:07:49] would put the seventh seal in the bible
[1:07:53] if it spoke of genesis it's in the bible
[1:07:55] right
[1:07:56] so it's not something added right not
[1:07:59] added in revelation
[1:08:03] it's spoken from genesis
[1:08:05] but it's a scene
[1:08:08] webster says the word saying means
[1:08:11] the place where some action or event
[1:08:13] occurs
[1:08:16] let's see
[1:08:18] let's see if i got it
[1:08:21] yep
[1:08:26] so we see that the seven seals not
[1:08:28] seventh
[1:08:30] the seven seals
[1:08:32] has the book sealed
[1:08:34] and until they are broken all seven
[1:08:39] is still silence
[1:08:40] in heaven
[1:08:45] yeah my brother
[1:08:47] don't understand because they've been
[1:08:48] standing out of my place for 3 000 years
[1:08:53] it's about 2 000 years in heaven
[1:08:58] it's about to space half hour
[1:09:06] i said deer hunting the other day and i
[1:09:08] saw a deer
[1:09:09] ever seen one
[1:09:11] stand in one spot emotionless
[1:09:15] for over 10 minutes
[1:09:18] it never wiggled a tail it never wiggled
[1:09:20] in here
[1:09:23] it stood there
[1:09:24] i grunted bladed called it and
[1:09:27] everything
[1:09:29] snort wheezed at it and everything was
[1:09:31] booked
[1:09:32] and it stood perfectly still
[1:09:37] the hell i'm sure it seems i'll do that
[1:09:40] right
[1:09:41] you mean i can stand ten minutes in one
[1:09:43] place yeah
[1:09:44] and never move a muscle
[1:09:49] well that wouldn't be too long for 30
[1:09:51] minutes if you was
[1:09:54] looking at something wonderful
[1:10:00] remember by the time he gets to where
[1:10:02] he's at
[1:10:04] he's seeing the six seals revealed
[1:10:12] when the seventh comes
[1:10:15] and something happens
[1:10:17] there's a scene there
[1:10:19] what is it saying let's read it
[1:10:23] go ahead number 10.
[1:10:27] let's read this scene
[1:10:32] this in heaven
[1:10:35] america 241 of the seventh seal
[1:10:40] i think it goes to paragraph two
[1:10:44] 2 49.
[1:10:46] and the four 20 elders stood before god
[1:10:48] and they're harping with their hearts
[1:10:51] they quit playing their hearts
[1:10:54] the angels rushed their sin in heaven
[1:10:57] they holy cherubim to serve him and
[1:11:00] isaiah saw the temple with the six
[1:11:01] winning flying saying holy holy
[1:11:05] the opposed to the temple would move he
[1:11:07] said they're doing their presence
[1:11:09] the holy seraphim huss
[1:11:11] angels quit singing
[1:11:13] we're flying in the presence of god sin
[1:11:15] holy holy he just stopped
[1:11:20] now i'm talking about a scene
[1:11:25] i look out there right now and i see a
[1:11:27] scene in front of my eyes
[1:11:29] i see people sitting there
[1:11:32] you know what you see i see
[1:11:35] you see me standing
[1:11:38] here a scene
[1:11:42] you can watch
[1:11:44] no anger singing no praises no no
[1:11:46] watercolor no nothing
[1:11:49] there was silence
[1:11:52] hush deadly silence in heaven
[1:11:56] for half hour
[1:11:57] all the hosts of heaven was solid for
[1:11:59] this half hour
[1:12:01] when this seventh seal mystery in the
[1:12:04] book of redemption was broke open
[1:12:06] think of it
[1:12:08] but it's broke
[1:12:10] the lamb breaks it
[1:12:15] they were all by a scene
[1:12:18] you think about all the
[1:12:22] the best way to describe it what i'm
[1:12:24] looking at is
[1:12:26] like you you've got a um
[1:12:32] a live performance
[1:12:34] all right
[1:12:35] you know what i'm saying
[1:12:36] what is the word for it you go to the
[1:12:38] theater and you see a a live performance
[1:12:42] all right
[1:12:43] now what happened that what is the life
[1:12:45] scene of that live live performance
[1:12:52] he said well when the husbands and my
[1:12:53] older two they kiss and they are they
[1:12:55] right off into the sunset on the worst
[1:12:58] that's not the last scene
[1:13:01] what's the life scene of a play
[1:13:07] when all the actors
[1:13:10] gather back on stage
[1:13:14] for their final
[1:13:16] bow
[1:13:21] live performances
[1:13:23] not roy rogers riding off the sunset
[1:13:33] and see they're all brought forth
[1:13:37] i remember we were down
[1:13:40] i guess it might have been when we were
[1:13:42] up in
[1:13:44] where he saw that
[1:13:47] the performance of the crucifixion and
[1:13:49] the thing
[1:13:51] and you know that when they introduced
[1:13:53] those actors
[1:13:56] that guy played that devil so good
[1:13:59] though i guess he got as good an old
[1:14:01] of clapping as any of the rest of him
[1:14:06] because he's done the best he could to
[1:14:08] portray his part
[1:14:10] but think about it a scene
[1:14:12] where everything had just stopped
[1:14:17] and not a muscle is moved
[1:14:21] because it might give away the secret
[1:14:27] he's satan he's watching every move ever
[1:14:29] thought everything
[1:14:32] amen
[1:14:32] and he'd like to know
[1:14:35] how to try to hinder you and i
[1:14:37] you've done a good job
[1:14:40] because he's a good devil
[1:14:44] he's done a good job that's right but
[1:14:46] the scene of it
[1:14:48] now we got some
[1:14:51] we got a scene
[1:14:54] for 30 minutes
[1:14:58] that they're standing in place
[1:15:01] and nobody moving
[1:15:06] see because it's the plan of redemption
[1:15:16] so we know it's a scene
[1:15:21] we know it's
[1:15:23] there's something taking place
[1:15:25] or the scene would not be
[1:15:27] there
[1:15:30] now
[1:15:31] what is taking place
[1:15:40] all the actors are in place
[1:15:45] i seen
[1:15:49] what are they looking at
[1:15:56] could it be that they're looking at
[1:15:57] earth if what is taking place
[1:16:02] could it be
[1:16:06] could it be that they're seeing on earth
[1:16:12] in manifestation
[1:16:15] what they played out the acts of the
[1:16:18] play
[1:16:19] in heaven
[1:16:30] we don't know where it is or not
[1:16:36] okay
[1:16:41] what did your prophet say it was
[1:16:44] i'm gonna roll up a little
[1:16:52] he said now as certain as i stand in the
[1:16:53] platform
[1:16:55] i had the revelation that revealed
[1:16:59] right back up above there he said i
[1:17:01] won't tell you my revelation of it
[1:17:06] now that shouldn't be any problem for
[1:17:08] him to tell us his revelation of it if
[1:17:10] we believe that he was a prophet
[1:17:13] should
[1:17:14] it should it be any problem for him to
[1:17:17] tell us the secrets of the bible
[1:17:20] if he's a prophet
[1:17:21] right now he wasn't a prophet um yeah
[1:17:23] okay
[1:17:27] if he was a prophet then he could tell
[1:17:29] us the secrets
[1:17:32] because the word comes to the prophet
[1:17:34] right that's right
[1:17:35] but he said i said a threefold man
[1:17:39] so now we know the seventh seal is what
[1:17:43] he's in a three-fold manner
[1:17:47] so if he's in a three-fold manner that
[1:17:49] means there's three parts or something
[1:17:51] that's right is that
[1:17:52] their english wording matter
[1:17:55] won't do it
[1:17:58] what's that i will speak to you in the
[1:18:00] gossip of a full day
[1:18:02] hold on
[1:18:05] and then let's go over there first
[1:18:08] here's a revelation to begin what i want
[1:18:11] to tell you what it is
[1:18:15] what happened is that those seven
[1:18:17] thunders
[1:18:19] that he heard thundered
[1:18:21] and was forbidden to write
[1:18:23] that's what the mystery is laying behind
[1:18:25] those
[1:18:26] seven consecutive
[1:18:28] thunders rolling out
[1:18:31] so now we know that it's a scene
[1:18:35] and they don't want to give away the
[1:18:36] plan of redemption we know that
[1:18:40] don't find out we're picking up a lot of
[1:18:41] things right all right
[1:18:44] the lobby says ain't nothing there
[1:18:46] we're just taking what he said
[1:18:49] now he said it's no seven thunders
[1:19:00] now
[1:19:05] let's go over to revelation 10.
[1:19:11] all right you got it brother i don't
[1:19:13] know i guess i told you to put it on
[1:19:14] there you have revelation 10.
[1:19:21] i wonder have you really ever read that
[1:19:24] oh my brother's halfway around we're at
[1:19:27] it forty seven thousand eight hundred
[1:19:28] thirty two times already
[1:19:31] let's read one more
[1:19:33] okay
[1:19:34] one more time
[1:19:42] remember i got a quote after this one
[1:19:44] where brother around says
[1:19:46] that revelations
[1:19:49] 10
[1:19:51] is exactly the same as revelations 1 13.
[1:19:59] revelation 1 13 says
[1:20:05] one like unto the son of man heard about
[1:20:07] the pounds with a golden girdle
[1:20:11] that's finished
[1:20:14] i'll give you a quote in just a second
[1:20:18] where does revelations 10 take place
[1:20:22] and brother ronald said
[1:20:25] that the seventh seal was
[1:20:28] part one fold one
[1:20:30] was the seven thunders
[1:20:37] and i saw another mighty angel
[1:20:39] come down from heaven
[1:20:43] this is not in heaven
[1:20:46] are you with me
[1:20:51] hiya how are you and how much are ya man
[1:20:55] you know what i thought about doing the
[1:20:56] other day i know what i mean i don't
[1:20:58] know brother gary's not back here but i
[1:21:00] get it on him
[1:21:01] he's making some more sunday
[1:21:03] but he has problems i know that
[1:21:06] but you know what i thought about doing
[1:21:09] i thought instead of saying hi you
[1:21:11] higher we'd say what's the football
[1:21:13] score
[1:21:18] makes everybody else
[1:21:20] you never go to the football game go to
[1:21:21] sleep
[1:21:23] they never seen nobody sleeping in a
[1:21:25] football game
[1:21:33] we play football
[1:21:35] okay
[1:21:37] i know what i mean
[1:21:41] but once
[1:21:43] and i saw another mighty angel come down
[1:21:46] from heaven
[1:21:48] this is not in heaven
[1:21:50] this is on earth
[1:21:53] he clothed
[1:21:55] with a cloud and a rainbow up on his
[1:21:57] head
[1:21:58] in his face as it were the sun and his
[1:22:00] feet his filters are fired brother and
[1:22:01] said that's christ
[1:22:03] all right
[1:22:05] that's why he compares it with
[1:22:06] revelations 1 13
[1:22:08] it's christ
[1:22:10] all right now watch
[1:22:15] and he had in his hand a little book
[1:22:18] open
[1:22:23] it was closed in revelation 5.
[1:22:26] revelation 10 is open
[1:22:28] okay
[1:22:30] and he set his right foot upon the sea
[1:22:33] left foot on the earth okay
[1:22:35] that's christ
[1:22:37] the mighty angel christ
[1:22:40] right
[1:22:41] right now watch
[1:22:45] this one on earth
[1:22:49] right
[1:22:53] cried with a loud voice
[1:22:56] and when a lion roar
[1:23:00] and when he had cried
[1:23:02] seven
[1:23:05] utter thunders
[1:23:05] voices
[1:23:11] the thunders don't sound in heaven
[1:23:14] that's
[1:23:18] right got the quote letting here say
[1:23:21] well don't worry about it
[1:23:22] i'll read in a minute
[1:23:26] the thunders don't sound in heaven
[1:23:30] he said whatever it says
[1:23:32] yeah it only says
[1:23:35] there was silence in heaven
[1:23:40] it don't say nothing about the thunder
[1:23:43] revolution they want
[1:23:46] but around them told us what it was
[1:23:50] right
[1:23:54] when he had cried
[1:23:58] there's one standing on earth
[1:24:01] seven thunders are divorces
[1:24:04] and when they sally thundered and
[1:24:05] uttered their voices
[1:24:06] once
[1:24:09] he's wrote about the seals
[1:24:12] come on
[1:24:14] are you following my thought
[1:24:17] he wrote about seal one seal two seal
[1:24:19] three four five six
[1:24:21] and seven if nothing else he wrote
[1:24:23] silence in heaven
[1:24:26] i'm watching now
[1:24:29] when the seven thunders had under their
[1:24:31] voices
[1:24:34] seven thunder uttered their their
[1:24:39] voices
[1:24:42] i was about to write
[1:24:44] i heard a voice from heaven saying unto
[1:24:46] me
[1:24:48] seal up those things which is 700
[1:24:51] and write them not
[1:24:57] out my head's not working
[1:25:06] he's told not to ride
[1:25:10] john was never told not to write
[1:25:13] revelation 6 1
[1:25:15] over to the end of it and then eight one
[1:25:19] he was told to write it
[1:25:23] then when you get to revelations 10 the
[1:25:25] book is open
[1:25:29] it came open in chapter 6 through
[1:25:31] chapter 8
[1:25:33] right
[1:25:35] the nines on earth
[1:25:38] what if it is what i saw one ago
[1:25:41] versus one of them
[1:25:44] the dead hushly silence in heaven
[1:25:46] with them looking down here to see
[1:25:48] what's going on
[1:25:59] he said don't write it
[1:26:03] you know that daniel heard the thunders
[1:26:07] now i didn't give them to put up on the
[1:26:08] screen
[1:26:13] but he can probably run it hurry and
[1:26:15] hurt him and grab a few hundred let's
[1:26:16] write him down you'll heard
[1:26:18] because that's what they can do
[1:26:20] the best is in 1954
[1:26:23] 719
[1:26:26] which is god's provided way of healing
[1:26:29] paragraph e12
[1:26:33] remember daniel heard those seven voices
[1:26:38] listen to the reading
[1:26:41] heard their voices
[1:26:44] and he started to write
[1:26:46] he said don't write it
[1:26:47] it'll reveal it in the last days was
[1:26:49] daniel told
[1:26:52] in chapter 12 i think it is
[1:26:54] seal up the book
[1:26:59] daniel heard the prophet said
[1:27:01] those seven voices
[1:27:07] message on revelation book of symbols
[1:27:10] 56
[1:27:13] 6 17.
[1:27:18] daniel was told by the angel
[1:27:23] daniel heard
[1:27:24] seven thunders
[1:27:26] right
[1:27:30] they uttered their voices
[1:27:36] daniel grabbed his pen and started to
[1:27:38] write
[1:27:39] and the angel says
[1:27:41] don't you write it right
[1:27:45] now you read the book of daniel and
[1:27:46] you'll find
[1:27:47] not daniel hearing seven thunders
[1:27:51] so don't go looking for it this is it's
[1:27:53] not dire and verbatim words
[1:27:57] but when daniel sees the end time in the
[1:27:59] 12th chapter
[1:28:01] he's told to seal up the book
[1:28:05] and the prophecy i think it might even
[1:28:07] be the ninth shelter
[1:28:09] but anyhow i said to book it down you
[1:28:10] know
[1:28:11] seal up the book right don't write it
[1:28:13] until the end
[1:28:15] the run city heard the thunders
[1:28:19] division church age 1960 1205
[1:28:23] and daniel heard the thunders
[1:28:27] and forbidden
[1:28:28] and john heard the voices
[1:28:31] and this book was sealed
[1:28:35] with seven seals
[1:28:40] daniel heard the thunders and john heard
[1:28:42] the voices
[1:28:44] but i read just above there that daniel
[1:28:46] heard the voices
[1:28:53] 1962 909 in his presence
[1:28:57] daniel heard the voice
[1:29:00] as the thunders
[1:29:02] and was forbidden to write
[1:29:05] john was prevented to write it
[1:29:07] but it's still on the back side of the
[1:29:08] book
[1:29:13] where does the thunder sound brother
[1:29:15] branham
[1:29:17] paragraph three five through three one
[1:29:19] eight of the
[1:29:21] is this the sign of the end sir
[1:29:24] 62 12 30.
[1:29:27] look where the voices was the thunders
[1:29:31] not in heaven
[1:29:48] from the heavens
[1:29:50] they uttered from the earth and i was
[1:29:52] about to write when i heard the voice
[1:29:53] from heaven saying unto me seal up
[1:29:55] capital s-e-a-l see what those things
[1:29:57] which the seven thunders and write them
[1:29:59] not
[1:30:02] um
[1:30:09] what is brother brown what is a thunder
[1:30:13] well it's a blue blue blue
[1:30:17] finger
[1:30:19] yep
[1:30:20] and you remember elijah was in the
[1:30:24] cave
[1:30:26] and he heard the thunder
[1:30:29] and the lightning
[1:30:32] and the wind
[1:30:35] but he wouldn't come out
[1:30:41] until he heard the still small voice
[1:30:44] that's right
[1:30:46] do you want all the loud blessings and
[1:30:48] hollering like the preachers of this
[1:30:50] message do
[1:30:52] or do you want to steal small voice
[1:30:54] speaking to you
[1:30:58] where does this understand what around
[1:31:00] this sound on earth amen
[1:31:05] they don't sound in heaven there's no
[1:31:06] scripture putting it in heaven
[1:31:13] in heaven it's a sealed up book
[1:31:16] and the lamb comes forth to open the
[1:31:18] book
[1:31:22] but it's only after the book is
[1:31:24] basically totally made manifest does he
[1:31:26] come forth to open the book
[1:31:28] it's after the 2000 years which means
[1:31:30] it's already the six seals is already
[1:31:32] almost completed
[1:31:34] except for the tribulation period coming
[1:31:35] on
[1:31:41] what is it thunder brother brian
[1:31:46] program 146 first seal
[1:31:50] what the thunder
[1:31:52] remember a loud clapping noise of a
[1:31:54] thunder is the voice of god
[1:31:59] that's what the bible said see a clapper
[1:32:02] thunder they thought it was thunder do
[1:32:04] you remember that jesus when it was out
[1:32:06] there with him you know they thought it
[1:32:08] thunder
[1:32:09] but it was god he understood for it was
[1:32:11] revealed to him see it was a thunder
[1:32:18] i got 148
[1:32:20] first steal it thundered as soon as the
[1:32:22] lounge struck back to seal
[1:32:24] what did it reveal not all of it said
[1:32:27] first it was god next is the symbol then
[1:32:29] it's revealed
[1:32:30] see he's it's coming from the throne
[1:32:33] can't be seen or heard it's sealed up
[1:32:35] the lounge blood paid the pride it
[1:32:37] thundered when he spoke it out and when
[1:32:39] he did a while horse rider started out
[1:32:41] it was still a symbol
[1:32:44] program 152 the first seal the voices of
[1:32:47] thunder the voice came from blur
[1:32:51] now you're gonna
[1:32:52] i hope you can get that milk all right
[1:32:54] you got it good because see you're going
[1:32:56] to think i'm throwing you a curve
[1:33:01] because i just got through saying the
[1:33:03] thunder's never sounded in heaven they
[1:33:04] sound on earth your prophets when it
[1:33:06] said
[1:33:08] now look at him what he's saying it
[1:33:09] sounds like he's gonna throw you a curve
[1:33:11] but he's not
[1:33:13] the voice is a thunder
[1:33:16] the voice came from word
[1:33:23] from the throne where the lamb had just
[1:33:25] left his intercessor
[1:33:27] he's standing here to take his position
[1:33:30] he's claimed but the thunder came from
[1:33:31] the inside the throne thundered
[1:33:34] out the lamb was standing out here
[1:33:37] thunder where the lamb had left the
[1:33:39] father strong to go to take his own
[1:33:40] trunk
[1:33:47] i thought we believed that we were the
[1:33:49] throne that's right
[1:33:51] i thought we believe this is where god
[1:33:53] is at
[1:33:54] right
[1:33:57] that's not throwing a curve that's
[1:33:58] telling exactly what it is
[1:34:00] because remember in revelations 10 of
[1:34:02] what it says in revelations 10 it says
[1:34:08] that what
[1:34:10] don't try to pull it back up on you
[1:34:15] and he cried with a loud voice and when
[1:34:17] a lion roared and when he had cried
[1:34:19] seven thunders earned their voices
[1:34:21] where from from heaven coming down to
[1:34:23] earth
[1:34:27] he's delivering the revelation to his
[1:34:29] prophet so it's exactly right the
[1:34:31] thunder sounds on earth
[1:34:33] but the voice is in heaven
[1:34:39] the one who's sounding it is in heaven
[1:34:42] the prophet has got to catch it
[1:34:44] and speak it or we don't hear it
[1:34:47] do you understand why i put so much
[1:34:49] emphasis on the prophet
[1:34:51] he catches it and he can speak it and we
[1:34:53] hear it
[1:34:54] the thunder is on earth
[1:34:57] the one who's hearing and writing but
[1:34:59] here it comes from glory
[1:35:03] we're the lamb that took the book
[1:35:07] he's down here with you and i folks
[1:35:10] the thunder's the voice of god when the
[1:35:12] seal breaks
[1:35:20] it's not in heaven it's on earth
[1:35:28] daniel was told by the angel
[1:35:32] daniel heard seven thunders
[1:35:35] they uttered their voices daniel heard
[1:35:37] his pen and started to write
[1:35:39] the angel said don't write it
[1:35:44] daniel heard the thunders
[1:35:46] what is a thunder brother brown it's the
[1:35:49] voice of god
[1:35:51] when the seal breaks
[1:35:54] have you heard his voice that's right
[1:35:59] see those seven thunders
[1:36:04] seals back up the book
[1:36:07] only the bride
[1:36:09] will have the seven thunders
[1:36:11] even though the angel has broken
[1:36:15] even though it was written in the word
[1:36:18] nobody can understand it with the bride
[1:36:21] he's the only one who has the ability to
[1:36:23] hear the voice of god
[1:36:25] what is the thunder brother dale what
[1:36:26] are you saying the thunder's the voice
[1:36:28] of god has he spoke to you
[1:36:36] as he spoke to you by way of the prophet
[1:36:37] messenger
[1:36:43] what a wonderful day
[1:36:47] to be able to stand here and realize
[1:36:52] before by him that lived forever and
[1:36:53] ever
[1:36:55] the time would be no longer
[1:36:58] but in the seventh verse he says but in
[1:37:01] the days of the voice of the seventh
[1:37:03] angel when he said begin to sound
[1:37:05] the mysteries of god would be revealed
[1:37:08] may i state it this way
[1:37:10] in the days of the voice of the seventh
[1:37:12] angel the seven thunders
[1:37:16] will be revealed by the prophet
[1:37:20] those seven thunders is what holds those
[1:37:21] seals
[1:37:25] if you stay up in heaven
[1:37:27] where everybody wants to go
[1:37:29] then you're not down here where god is
[1:37:31] at
[1:37:33] not down here where he's revealing
[1:37:34] himself
[1:37:37] you're not down here where the seals are
[1:37:38] really coming into reality
[1:37:43] you're not down here
[1:37:44] where christ is
[1:37:48] christ speaking to you
[1:37:50] you see that's why you'll never know
[1:37:52] what that
[1:37:52] seal is until that voice speaks to you
[1:37:58] no man can call jesus the christ what
[1:38:03] accepted me by the holy ghost
[1:38:06] that perforation that we get around
[1:38:09] the holy ghost that speaks to you
[1:38:12] revealing to you what this prophet has
[1:38:14] said
[1:38:15] is that not the voice of god
[1:38:18] that's why it's not seven men like some
[1:38:20] used to think of the thunders were seven
[1:38:22] men and they'd name all seven literal
[1:38:24] men
[1:38:26] no
[1:38:30] how long have you got to stay this
[1:38:31] afternoon
[1:38:33] the prophet of god said there was an
[1:38:35] angel met him daily
[1:38:38] in the room
[1:38:42] you need those quotes
[1:38:44] angel met him daily in the room
[1:38:49] to bring him to revelation
[1:38:51] that's why he so cherished the looks of
[1:38:53] those angels when he saw it and the
[1:38:55] seventh was the one so
[1:38:59] you know connected to him
[1:39:01] why he said the one with the seventh
[1:39:03] seal
[1:39:07] you're going to find out eventually that
[1:39:09] there wasn't seven seals to be revealed
[1:39:12] there was one seal to be broke
[1:39:15] and that was the seventh
[1:39:18] to you and i
[1:39:21] and that's god speaking by way of a
[1:39:23] mouthpiece
[1:39:26] can stick straight to you and i
[1:39:30] and we can see it
[1:39:33] but without christ in you
[1:39:35] by the new birth you can't hear what is
[1:39:37] being said
[1:39:39] it is only vain jangling of words
[1:39:43] but if you have the new birth
[1:39:45] you can say well brother dale you mean
[1:39:47] to tell me god's been talking to me
[1:39:53] that's right
[1:39:55] god's been talking to you and i by way
[1:39:58] of a prophet
[1:40:01] i thought that's what we believe
[1:40:06] i thought we believed he was god's
[1:40:08] mouthpiece
[1:40:11] and it was you used to speak god's
[1:40:14] mysteries to you and i'm
[1:40:22] see then there was seven voices of the
[1:40:24] seven thunders that we just read
[1:40:27] because each one came daily to telling
[1:40:29] the prophet
[1:40:32] a voice came to the prophet every day
[1:40:35] to tell him what that seal was
[1:40:43] then you could tie together the angel of
[1:40:45] the lord it would meet him in the room
[1:40:46] you could tie together the holy spirit
[1:40:48] that would be in the room you can tie
[1:40:49] together a lot of things when you say it
[1:40:51] and that's what we're going to do
[1:40:54] when we finish one more message we're
[1:40:56] going to go through the seventh seal to
[1:40:58] see what it was to the prophet
[1:41:04] and see that that's got to be in you
[1:41:07] then you'll find out he wasn't talking
[1:41:09] about himself
[1:41:12] he was talking about the word of the
[1:41:14] lord
[1:41:18] amos three and seven i'll do nothing
[1:41:23] but i'll show my secrets to the prophets
[1:41:27] we've had a prophet to come in our day
[1:41:28] to deliver a message unto us that's
[1:41:31] right
[1:41:33] and that prophet would be the voice of
[1:41:35] god
[1:41:38] you remember in a tape where the random
[1:41:40] voice would be talking god said this is
[1:41:42] not brother this is not william brown or
[1:41:44] brother brown or whatever
[1:41:46] this is god speaking that i'm just using
[1:41:49] his voice
[1:41:55] brother brown and when he gets over in
[1:41:56] the seal book he said look
[1:41:58] it's been the angels of the lord
[1:42:03] not been a man
[1:42:06] bringing us back here for this message
[1:42:08] tonight
[1:42:12] have you heard his voice
[1:42:15] go home put on a tape put one on going
[1:42:16] home
[1:42:18] and listen to the voice of god
[1:42:21] yeah
[1:42:22] lord i found where he made mistakes
[1:42:24] that wasn't the voice of god
[1:42:31] no problem
[1:42:32] right
[1:42:35] when he said
[1:42:37] holy ghost and you know instead of
[1:42:39] saying
[1:42:40] antichrist from the white horse rider
[1:42:42] that wasn't god
[1:42:46] but you better be careful what you say
[1:42:48] about him on there because he comes down
[1:42:50] through that message and says if i'm
[1:42:52] wrong god will vindicate it
[1:42:53] and god did
[1:42:55] so i wouldn't argue too much with him
[1:42:56] about it
[1:43:00] you see the voice of god come to you and
[1:43:02] i to a prophet
[1:43:06] amen
[1:43:08] that way we don't need nobody to
[1:43:10] interpret it
[1:43:13] we just need to believe it let's start
[1:43:16] come on brother
[1:43:19] silence in heaven is what the title was
[1:43:21] put
[1:43:22] on because you see if you listen to what
[1:43:25] i'm saying
[1:43:26] until that voice speaks to you
[1:43:33] there's nothing going on to you
[1:43:40] but when he starts revealing himself
[1:43:44] like those angels and all standing in
[1:43:47] all looking at the earth
[1:43:49] as to seeing a bride of jesus christ be
[1:43:51] coming to work
[1:43:59] they know the thunders will issue it
[1:44:01] forth pretty soon
[1:44:07] see we're finding out there's a lot of
[1:44:08] things under the seventh seal that those
[1:44:10] people don't deal with
[1:44:15] to find out
[1:44:17] maybe there's some things where we need
[1:44:19] comprehend
[1:44:24] but we need to understand it here
[1:44:26] i'm not trying to go to heaven today to
[1:44:28] find out what's going on up there all
[1:44:30] right
[1:44:31] paul went up there and come back and
[1:44:34] said i can't even tell you what went on
[1:44:36] up there
[1:44:38] so why do we want to get up our farm
[1:44:40] right let's take it where we got down
[1:44:42] here
[1:44:43] and then we can go up there
[1:44:46] what are we going to do
[1:44:51] oh
[1:45:14] my voice
[1:45:30] um
[1:45:55] everyday
[1:46:10] let me go
[1:46:23] becoming the word of god
[1:46:31] they
[1:46:32] realized plenty of times
[1:46:44] every day
[1:47:07] love
[1:47:43] everyday
[1:47:58] oh
[1:48:16] your words
[1:48:26] you start talking to them about one god
[1:48:28] and they just back away from them
[1:48:36] until god revealed
[1:49:07] listening to what it said about the
[1:49:08] problem
[1:49:18] rejecting the word
[1:49:38] is
[1:50:21] you got no choice
[1:50:28] remember the services we prayed the lord
[1:50:30] blessed remember that this is coming
[1:50:33] down to christmas time
[1:50:35] that we never have tried to have to say
[1:50:37] we had to put christ into christmas no
[1:50:39] we don't take him out
[1:50:42] we know really what it's all about
[1:50:45] but we don't have to worry about it
[1:50:47] like the prophet we've listened the
[1:50:49] other night there where he was saying he
[1:50:50] said
[1:50:51] you know about them little kids
[1:50:53] you know
[1:50:55] the little kids
[1:50:56] he said he's talking to an 18 month old
[1:50:58] baby now how much of an 18 month old
[1:51:00] baby second like what he said
[1:51:02] he said that little girl said he said
[1:51:05] something about she was saying you know
[1:51:07] got jingle bells jingle bells
[1:51:10] he said something i forgot how it went
[1:51:11] but he did something about
[1:51:13] santa claus she said that's my daddy
[1:51:17] he said well that's the way we need to
[1:51:19] have it
[1:51:21] that's my daddy we've never put emphasis
[1:51:23] upon
[1:51:25] christmas but we've never
[1:51:27] thought it off either
[1:51:29] we've always said put up a tree if you
[1:51:31] want one
[1:51:32] if you don't want one don't put it up
[1:51:35] anybody throws off on either way you're
[1:51:37] wrong
[1:51:39] because we want to stay that way your
[1:51:41] prophet had a christmas tree so there's
[1:51:43] no problem with putting one up right
[1:51:47] but if you don't want one up nobody
[1:51:48] loves it of course it's kind of late now
[1:51:50] anyway you know i didn't do this about a
[1:51:52] month ahead of time
[1:51:53] but just don't go off on nobody
[1:51:57] you know what
[1:51:59] i mean there's no problem
[1:52:08] the greatest gift could ever give
[1:52:09] anybody this time of the year
[1:52:11] is to tell them about jesus christ
[1:52:14] amen
[1:52:17] father we thank you for today and we ask
[1:52:19] you to just bless us now as we go our
[1:52:20] separate ways
[1:52:22] we pray that what we've said lord is
[1:52:24] needful
[1:52:26] we try
[1:52:27] you just help us
[1:52:28] open our eyes that we may see you lord
[1:52:31] and guide us in that understanding hand
[1:52:33] forgive our sins
[1:52:35] keep us in your love be with everybody
[1:52:37] on the highway give a safe journey let
[1:52:39] your light shine in our hearts and lives
[1:52:41] that the world may see truly a christmas
[1:52:44] example in our hearts and our lives
[1:52:47] not about a santa claus
[1:52:49] but about a resurrected lord jesus
[1:52:51] christ
[1:52:53] to walk in us in jesus name
[1:52:55] amen you dismissed
[1:53:01] a woman in
[1:53:03] the bible
