in you guide us now in jesus name amen romans 8 28 for we know that all things work together for good to them that love god to them who are the called according to his purpose for whom he did for no he did also predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn amin among many brethren now what is it the prophet said he predestinates what by his for knowledge not that he desired this person be saved this would be lost but it's all by his foreknowledge all right said moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called and whom he called them he also justified and whom he justified them he also glorified what shall we then say to these things what shall we say if god be for us who can be against us that's a wonderful statement isn't it all right revelations i want to try to get a little point in tonight if i can so we'll jump over to revelations and read verse 1 of chapter 5. and i saw in the right hand of him that said on the throne a book written within and on the backside sealed with seven seals you may be seated the lord had his blessing to the reading of the word now we've been quite a while talking about predestination and we went through and come down into the garden to see that you know mankind fell because god knew if he gave us an opportunity the prophet said by free moral agents he gave us a choice that we would fall all right and he knew that we would do that but our fall would bring about or bring to price the ability for him to be able to be a savior a healer etc and so then we look bad at the fall but we know that there's more than just looking at the fall and if we just keep talking about the fall then you know we're just uh taking a one-sided view but now i want us to keep our thoughts in mind though of one thing and then if we get a chance to get over to it tonight if we don't we'll take it up sunday and continue on but in genesis 3 15 he said he would put enmity between thy seed and the seed of the woman all right now eve through the wrong act with the beast and not adam then she mingled or as we'll get to it in a minute she hybrid the whole human race all right now but my point i wanted you to see was and i've been trying to drive it in there on it of we can talk about the seed of the woman but remember it took a womb to bring the seed of the serpent we know the serpent doesn't have a seed so it was not using that all right but it took a wound to bring it forth and that's what he's done but it also took a wound to bring forth a savior for mankind so then you know it would take that to be then the woman would be used because it promised in genesis 3 15 that between thy seed and the seed of the woman now the woman doesn't have a seed so it's got to be speaking of some other way and in doing that then what did we wind up talking about that the womb of eve brought forth the seed of the serpent now listen because that's why it would be called the seed of the serpent see it was caught if it would have been called the seat of the beast like i was trying to get a point to you sunday if if the bible would have said the seat of the beast well everybody knew what happened they would have figured out the beast and what was going on but to be a mystery then it would be called the seed of the serpent because it was that seed all right because it started with the seed of unbelief because that's the seed satan carries he has no physical seed no way to bring forth he cannot create and neither is he a man that he could mingle into the human race but yet he saw his opportunity to be able to get eve to thinking wrong and then the wrong act would take place and it would bring forth and it would be his child now not his child by uh himself because he couldn't do it so it would have to be what would we call it vicariously or in place off that the seed of the serpent would come forth but yet what it would be it would be that the serpent used the beast all right and as he used the beast he brought death to the human race all right but yet by a wound there was a little sister named mary that she brought the seed of the woman going down the woman when he's speaking to eve the woman doesn't have a seed so he would bring forth the seed of the woman and how would that be that would have to be a very mysterious thing and i like the way the prophet of god said it and uh i want to just get right into the thought you say well i don't understand what all this has to do about predestination well god knew we'd fall all right by his foreknowledge but also by his foreign knowledge he knew that he would bring forth a savior all right see then it wouldn't be a a fall that would pull something over on god you know that he didn't know this was going to happen and something happened and he had to do something else no he knew exactly what he was doing as i said the other day then even though god would slay the animals and take the skins the prophet said off of them and make them skins to walk out of the garden with bloody skins flapping on them not only would would that be a part but that would be only the atonement all right it couldn't take away sin the atonement of the old testament of the animal life could not take away sin true so even though god killed the animals it would not take away sin so he had to do something else so in genesis 3 15 see he promised the seed of the woman to come but it would take 4 000 years before that would come into being we'll get back more on that lord willing sunday but just think about what we're saying now and watch how these two things work the seed of the woman and the seed of the serpent and watch what's your prophet i gave it to you the other day but let's read it again go back to page 99 of the ephesian church age which is a church age book let's just see what the prophet had to say and he's coming down and he used genesis 3 15 and i will put enmity between thee and the seed of the woman between thee and the woman and between thy seed and her seed it shall bruise thy head and thou shalt bruise his heel we know this took place at calvary at calvary he did bruise the heel of the lord jesus but the lord jesus breathed his head all right now if we give credit to the word that the woman did have a seed well now we know we've done red word the prophet said she don't have one all right but now giving credit to it then the serpent surely had a seat also there was if the seat of the woman was a man-child apart from the man not by man and not by mary producing an egg she didn't do it it had to be a virgin birth it had to be that would be egg and sperm both would be created of god so look what he's saying if the seed of the woman was a man child apart from the man without a man see all right then the seed of the serpent will be in the same pattern what a seed without a man right now listen then and that is another male must be born apart from human male instrumentality for both of them a human male will be born apart or separate from the human male instrumentality human male didn't have anything to do with it the adam had nothing to do with the seed of the serpent the beast was used to bring forth all right mary had no husband or nothing i mean you know she was engaged to joseph but there was no nothing wrong but she would bring forth a man child that would not be connected to the human race right now so watch them there is no student who does not know that the seat of the woman was the christ who came by they watched the instrumentality of god apart from the human intercourse didn't have anything to it she didn't bring no egg he showed us didn't have anything to do with it there's nothing connected right it is also just as well known that the predicted bruising of the serpent's head was an actuality of prophecy concerning what christ would accomplish against satan at the cross there at the cross christ would bruise the head of satan while satan would bruise the heel of the lord all right both brought forth from a wound the seed of the serpent the seed of the woman both comes from a wound but apart from human instrumentality i've told you a lot of people believe adam and eve in the garden that's the old denominational teaching the adam and eve in the garden was scheduled to come down here later to a place to do and reproduce but they got ahead of it and messed it up and and adam would be the tree of death and they would or you know life and eve would be the tree of death and you know but no it's got to be a separate from anything connected to the human race so the beast was used huh right that's why he was taken then if you ever you know notice the prophet then that's why i love the message where we got the answers the prophet said then that animal was used to pollute the wound so animal would be used as the sacrifice of the atonement right see then the animal life would have to be taken to replace that that's a beautiful picture to see it as it comes down as we'll get to it you know one of these days i want to preach uh just a message all the way through without uh using too many quotes just kind of scan through but i want you to think about it and think about that the way the seed of the woman would come forth satan the prophet said has a knowledge of the principles of life all right which he knew which animal would mix he knew better than to try a monkey and a human uh darwin couldn't even do that all right but yes that's where darwin failed at because he couldn't find the beast the missing link between man and the monkey well after the bible explains what it is but see satan knew not only would the with those two animals mix you know eve and the beast he knew that if he could in some way get that together he could pollute the human race is which what he did all right and in polluting the human race look where you and i would wind up being all right look at number two what we're talking about spoken words original seed part 2 62 3 18. but every man no matter where he's pope priest bishop whatever he is now people don't like for me to read the way i read uh every man no matter whether it be brother branham or samuel dale or james cawley you know i see people don't want you to mention brother branham into things they want to be him something special i i believe he's something special that's the message we got that's right but the human being was a human being he said now whether every man matter where he's a pope priest bishop whatever he is he dies what because he's he's a hybrid don't you call me no hybrid what are you oh my family come over on the mayflower yeah mine did too stowaway i don't care about talking like that i'm not throwing off on nobody i'm just plain to say it don't matter what all of us polluted we'll get back to that in just a second more and watch what happened he was born between satan and eve he said now no matter who he is well but i i can run my lineage back you know they got the message in them they got the doctrine and the message that if you were born from adam you could be saved but if you was born from the beast you couldn't be saved now that's not according to what the prophet said i'd like to hear the quotes for that you know i mean that's going out on internet i'd like to hear the quotes that shows you anything different as a two-lineage thing because of what your prophet said he was born between satan and eve everybody was born between satan but brother dale satan don't you just got to say and satan didn't have no seed that's exactly right we are that seed that he was able to produce by mingling or hybriding the human race oh don't you call me serpentine big boy well what are you i ain't no big boy but you're a serpent seed why do you need saved if you're not amen oh of course now you don't need to be saved all you got to do is just believe you always was right see the seed of the serpent is still here that seed of the serpents right up here that's why we was born between satan and eve what made mama and daddy get get you and i here started right up here right so we're born between what satan and eve and they call it whatever you want to it was satan and eve the original word had nothing to do with it the original word was life he had hybrid it and brought death he hybrid the human race and brought death all right now think about it see once the wound was polluted by the beast then there was nothing from there would ever be born that would be worth anything amen all right now even in your dog kingdom this is an example you take you've got a beautiful dog you've got purebred little nice little beagle you know pure bread let that mama mate with an old hound and you got a mixed up bunch of puppies right but you know what that female cannot be used to bring forth any pure lineage did you know that if you don't call the doctor and find out about it you know this once that female has received that male of a different uh form or whatever you want to call it different kind of dog horse is the same thing all animals i'm just using the dog where you can check it'll never wind up to be able to have a purebred he said well what what what well go check it and find out if i'm right or not he said well it could bleed itself out were they may tell you it can but get the point once the female received the wrong mail she would then from it on be a high breeder and none of her puppies no matter how much purebred the next male would be would not bring a purebred you can't get the papers on it do you understand see once eve received the beast her wound was polluted right right the wound being polluted then what would that cause would cause all of us to be what the prophet said hybrid oh i know people want to get those lineages and they want to get those sweet little things you know they want all kind of little but what good is those little things facing the word of god what i want is where the prophet said it because i just read to you he said we're all hybrid psalmist david said what born in sin shape it in iniquity spouse from our mother's womb and go forth a liar the prophet form summed it up by saying we are born in satan's kingdom subject to him how much greater could it be but you see we wanted everything to be some kind of a oh if i could just find if i could just find my lineage what go dig you might find something but what would it matter what you found there was only one person ever born correctly i said born correctly remember adam and eve were created when born even though you go back to cain and abel by your own bible we can see cain offered a sacrifice but why did abel offer one i mean he's a direct descendant right why did abel have to offer a sacrifice because he was polluted well i don't know i don't like that you just see this you bum fuzz with me bung falls no i don't i make it show up how stupid we really are we're to look at the natural things of the world we can find the word of god fulfilling right in it i said about a dog mix it with a a beagle with a hound you no longer have a beagle and for generation next generation next generation that gene will follow its way down you know that even oh i'll get off of that but listen when eve accepted satan's lie in her reasoning through her reasoning conscience affections etc then she accepted the beast and then the whole human being was polluted see there she stood with her mind polluted by satan's lie but see then once she went further with it it polluted the whole body everything that's why she's called the bible said eve the mother of all living all right that's why i tell you kids they tell you about these extraterrestrial beings out there if they are they come from here but according to the bible he's the mother of all living all right but now think about it see then by the pollution we would all wind up being polluted except for jesus christ now be careful here because as i said it polluted the wound the beast lineage polluted the wound right the earth where the virgin birth comes in that's why if mary had to produce the egg and even god produced the sperm germ whatever terms you want to use it would have still been the prophet said mankind producing a body he said that would have not been the seed of the woman that wouldn't have been christ he just buried that wound now you can say and quote and that's fine he's wounded spoken words reasonable seed i'll give you the quote her physical wound was pure and her spiritual wound was pure because she said be it unto me according to thy word but remember now the wound being polluted but yet by creation he bypassed the wound now are you listening i mean it don't hit you to think sometimes the prophets say every wound is polluted so every wound is polluted jesus come through a wound you don't think i do and then i begin to say lord help me the devil helped me think now you help me figure it out but you see you've heard the prophet without going into lengthy details you've heard the prophet he said if if mary produced the egg he said it meant they would have to be a physical intercourse to bring the egg down are you listening all right so now you got the key even though he came through the wound he never came by the instrumentality of the wound of mankind he came by creation there wasn't any act to bring the egg down you can ball i'll give you volumes of the books where the doctor says go ahead stay a dummy i don't like to talk like that but it gets you gets you to thinking a little you've got to have a sensible answer somewhere in the word of god for all of our things or else where are we left right see that's why it would be the seed of the woman i tried my best to preach that to you he said a woman don't have no seed that's right she was given a seed she wasn't just giving a sperm it hurt supply the egg no that would have been the pollution of the wound the polluting of the wound was the intercourse between eve and the beast right come on i know i'm playing but get the point see then jesus christ would could in no way come from a polluted wound see when you stay wound people are only looking at the external genital come on that is not the wound of a woman come on somebody get a little sense and start thinking that's external parts then jesus could come through the external parts of a woman and not be polluted but everybody else no matter who they are is going to come by intercourse and that's coming from the wound within the wound of mary with egg and sperm put together there's no physical intercourse today in in a test tube baby right a test tube baby is not like we talk about the test tube baby is what outside the body even from another person taken place within the body has nothing to do with no connection to the woman whatsoever just placed in her wound so when the egg and sperm was placed in mary's wound she had no relationship to bring it are you following me it would bypass the whole thing it wouldn't be the instrumentality of man it would be as the prophet said the instrumentality of god the instrumentality of god i read to you phase 99 ephesians church 8 instrumentality of god is the virgin birth the woman didn't have anything to do with it he just borrowed that you can call it whatever you want to it's hybrid right you see church why can't we believe that as the new birth as a virgin birth was god creating egg and sperm placing it into a borrowed wound why can't we see what the new birth is the new birth is not me and you it's christ it's christ coming and living in us i don't understand how come he does it that way i don't but it's not so beautiful it ties back to the virgin birth that he just uses us we're just the outside external parts of the living god that would come and live with inside of us in our soul and give us eternal life all right but see the wound of a woman can be used it was used to bring forth jesus christ it was used for that it was used to bring forth the seed of the woman which would be jesus christ right and see this heresy because it's given unto her that's why mary read back i mean eve back there when it comes over to about chapter five in genesis it starts talking about it and as it's fixing to come forth with seth she says god hath appointed me another seed instead of abel which came slow all right and she said god hath given me seed that would have been christ the genesis 3 15 would have been standing right there but it had to be in but he didn't do it he said you have to point it appointed is something you put in place of until something comes forth right appointed me a seed it'd be 4 000 years before the real true seat of the woman would come forth and that would be jesus christ see now think about it jesus then would be what we tried to preach there this past sunday and been on for 40 something years that jesus christ was not of this old race he wasn't just a man as they're preaching today and said he was just a man until the river jordan come and then when the river jordan comes he become god that's a prevalent doctrine a doctrine among the message people today but how can it be because my bible said he was born emmanuel which is god with us the prophet said he was born lord to christ the scripture says it but you see church we get some kind of an idea or a thought and it sounds beautiful like i told you cain and abel probably 20 years old when they got ready to make their sacrifices whatever age you want to put them okay adulthood whatever it was long time before they got there and here's abel offering a blood sacrifice but here's cain offering fruit which his mama taught him was what took place somebody taught him the prophet said she still thinks she's right why because she said i've gotten a man from the lord well you know she did because only god can create all right now but think about it think about what happened in mary and then we can see the day that we're living because it's it's it's going to be odd in a minute when you see me switch and look like going another direction but just remember this is the background look at number three what the prophet said on the future home of the heavenly bridegroom the earthly bride 1964 8002 remember that the holy ghost descended on jesus which jesus was a part of the earth why the germ of god the life of god was designed in the wound of a woman right that right which was the earth all right and then the life of god came in so he was the beginning of the creation of god hmm see and then that blood of god that was dire by that germ when it was shed at calvary dropped back upon the earth what far to redeem the earth now it's been justified and been sanctified called and claimed now it's to receive its baptism of fire to be cleansed for jesus and his bride he's talking about the future home right but he's talking about the beginning of the creation of god you mean god began probably said he began in the wound of a woman he created a body of melchizedek stepped into it walked down through the darkness but just took it back out jesus wasn't that way he was the beginning of the creation of god according to revelations 3 14. that's the message to this age then being the beginning of the creation of god who was that standing there according to hebrews 5 a body thou has prepared me so we know how the body came from the virgin mary by virgin birth right no man him instrumentality or anything else with it god created in the wound of mary the egg the sperm to bring forth the body then god himself stepped into that body right soul and spirit of almighty god who was that standing on earth the bible says it was god emmanuel god with us so the soul and spirit of almighty god entered that baby when it was born that's why your prophet will say little jehovah crying in a cradle he said little jehovah with no teeth who was that it was god almighty dwelling in a human vessel that's why the bible said god was in christ reconciling the world unto himself in him it says dwell what the body of jesus in that body dwelt what the fullness of the godhead bodily where's any other god see satan's telling people a lot of lies i thank god for not really have a thanksgiving thankfulness for the truth to be able to see the truth all right but see the life of god came in to that vessel that was created he said designed in the wound of a woman the life of god came into that body when it was dropped forth from mary and he was called the beginning of the creation of god no longer dealing by ways of mankind he says in the church age book this is not the old race he said made over or it would not be calling the new race or the beginning of the creation of god jesus christ was what god wanted in the beginning he had the example of adam because there stood adam with eternal life dwelling in a mortal body because his body was not eternal god wanted to come down and dwell with mankind but before he could do it sin entered the picture right the pollution came but then he would be the beginning of the creation he would start a new creation not on the old as i said adam was the closest but before he could anything could happen in any way he already was gone like wade said he caught it the other day when that's preaching about it see the tree of life was standing in the garden right is that scripture the tree of life was in the garden well there was no way mankind could partake of that tree of life once he had failed so god had to put him out of the garden or else he'd partake of that tree of life the bible said and live forever doesn't say he'd live eternal and live forever well you can't make an eternal sinner but you just think god waited 4 000 years to really bring into being himself in a human race that's what he wanted in the beginning did not the prophet say he created us or fellowship that's right he could come down in the garden and fellowship with adam and eve but he knew they were going to fall now come on folks i think it's about time we grow up we raised three kids and i think it turned out to be good kids but i knew all along that they were not angels now you think your kids are angels you got a problem a mental problem right because no matter how good or whatever we think they are they are kids right kids will come around sometimes and they'll say daddy we didn't tell you about this you didn't have to tell me it's kids they always say preachers kids worst of all right why because they're deceiving the others just go out and do the wrong don't worry about it preachers kids try to make you look good no daddy gonna beat him to death with his mouth there's nothing else but just be honest god knew when he put man in the garden and gave him free moral agency that he would go wrong is that sensible does that need a great revelation to understand this plain sense he knew what his children were going to do all right but he knew one day as i said when he's when he come forth there in genesis 1 uh 3 15 he said i will put enmity between thy seed and the seed of the woman he didn't wait till abraham came to make an unconditional covenant i gave you the quotes from the prophet when adam failed god came forth with an unconditional covenant i will put enmity but it'll take me four thousand years before i can get it here and until that time comes you're going to be bound under satan's domain and physically speaking we're still in satan's domain but by the baptism of the holy ghost the eternal life in our soul we're in the domain of god god's children god's offspring all right that's why i love this quote i'd like to give it to you all right look at number four because we just read now he's the beginning of the creation of god now what about it this is proving his word 1964 806 paragraph 146 so he god came down after going through this and now every son that you eat and born of a natural sexual birth the way you come and when it comes to a place to where you go through water baptism right in the holy ghost baptism then the holy ghost comes down to fire baptism and claims its creation you know what you he's talking of a twofold thing come on he's talking to the world he's talking of us right the same as it did him in the holy ghost and god is the self-saying spirit see it comes down and claims this body for the resurrection i got a little bit on i'll get to it lord willing sunday but he was raised for our justification all the father has given me will come not one will be lost i'll raise it up in the last days not one hire the head will ever perish that is the beginning of the creation of god this is what the continuation of the creation of god by him coming he made a way that there would be more because when it says the beginning of the creation remember that means there's got to be something else come forth because why would he say beginning of it you just say the creation of god but when you say the beginning of the creation of god that means there's more coming and the more coming is the bride of jesus christ by the new birth in our soul not our bodies not our spirit they're still in the old domain but the soul of the individual that center him whether you want to call it spirit or whether you want to call it soul just remember the centerium has only one sense it's either faith or doubt the second realm has memory reason conscious affections whatever you want to call it spirit or soul wherever you want to change it the body has seat takes field smell in here but that inner being of us by the new birth makes us part of that creation what creation then he was the beginning of it adam was not the beginning of the creation of god that's why the bible says that jesus christ is the only begotten of the father is that scripture adam was created jesus was begotten why because he was god begotten in human flesh god came down to live in human flesh but he couldn't just choose somebody to drop in them and he couldn't create a body and just jump into it as a full grown because it would not be our brother melchizedek was god in human flesh right but that flesh was a creation and it went right back out of existence he could not die for our sins as melchizedek he had to come to be our brother he had to become to be our kinsmen redeemer right to pay the price all right but we are the continuation of that creation i was trying to tell you there the other day see we think god created in the garden and he just quit he created the world he created the birds he created animal degree he created man and he quit show me that in the bible he never quit creating he only stopped creating the natural human part but he come down and created the egg and the sperm that his body would come from that he could step into and be my brother he's still creating you know why he's still creating if we're the continuation of that creation he must still be creating what's he creating his own family his own children paul on mars hill said that unknown god that you're talking about i'd like to talk to you about him did you even say your own poets say we are his offspring and he says that's what we are we are the offspring of god we're the rest of the creation amen god created a human super race that's all these ninja turtles and all of these things like that and all these you know mortal kombats and all that don't worry about it bullet between the eyes stop any of them right how many they can say oh man i know karate the fellow said i know collud ranks too ain't never seen a karate person yet that could tackle the bullet coming straight between the eyes brother harris used to tell about the guy you know he got so big up in it he thought he was he just get in the line or a tiger or line one he just man he just went in well they found a few pieces of him left do you think well we just shoot for rice that ain't even super to nothing i've always believed david and him knowed all about karate well you believe it or not i don't know but you mean a man who would tackle a lion or a bear i know it's the christ come on i know too they weren't afraid and all they carried was a big old stick right they take that stick and just whoop somebody death with it all right but i'm talking about a super race a prophet called a super church a bride when she realizes who she is and what she's here for right but think about it now okay now we're going to swap horses now for a second let you think we'll be swapping but just a little cough to put in for you to think about and we read over in the book of revelations 5 that there was one sitting on the throne in a book a book singular was in the hands of the one sitting on the throne in his right hand right now what kind of a book is that and i hope you're going to be able to tie this together with the beginning of the creation of god in the continuation of the creation of god and see who we really are is what i'm trying to do okay but over in revelations 20 and about 11 and 12 it speaks of the whites on judgment and it says at that white throne judgment that there were books and the book of life over in daniel um 10 9 or 10 10 i think it is i got it in here in a minute and i catch up with myself daniel saw the judgment and he saw books but in the book of revelation you only saw one book i mean revelation 5 1. one book what kind of a book was that that was in the hand of the one sitting on the throne what kind of a book according to number five brother which is the breach between the church ages and the seals paragraph 116. now oh my now the forfeited title deed is now in the hands of the original owner almighty god now the forfeited title deed you go back a little bit in the message there and you'll find brother random explaining that adam fell from eternal life and he forfeited his right to eternal life he had eternal life in his soul i don't believe he lost that some do but that's all right that's your business it's not mine i just don't see you can be given eternal life to be taken away from you i don't care who you are right because when enoch walked off the earth he's not going to have to walk back down somewhere because he ain't bright or fall out of heaven and come back down to earth and start over again see but adam lost the right the prophet said of eternal life and the earth he says he lost the fact that he never received eternal life in his flesh right he never come to that he didn't make it that far sin entered the picture but you know what somebody if he had it somebody one of these days is going to have that and we see jesus christ fulfilling exactly all of the things the prophet said that adam lost jesus christ restored and the restorer meant he walked through him first right he came to earth live died went to hell paid the price come up raised up the same body then he went up the rapture so jesus christ went through all of the things that adam could have lost all right but think about it now so the title deed didn't go back to satan he doesn't have any of those things where would he have it because you can't go over the book of revelation find satan sitting on the throne with a book in his hand it was god sitting on the throne so read it now the forfeited title deed is now in the hands of the original owner almighty god the title deed to the earth and to eternal life when adam forfeited it then satan's dirty hands could not take it so it went back to its original owner that's wonderful that's my thanksgiving god himself who's the original owner god himself we're going to find it just in a minute mary sits on the throne with it in his hand the title deed oh that makes me feel religious friends the title deed to eternal life abstract title deed to eternal life when adam forfeited for the wisdom for wisdom adam forfeited for wisdom instead of faith it went back to the hands of the owner almighty god what a great thing all right waiting what's it doing in the hands of god waiting for redemption claims he made a way of redemption he made a way back and someday the redeemer is going to take it back you see where we're getting to now see we'll watch this fellow sitting upon the throne all right so in revelations 5 there's one sitting on the throne he has a book not books all right so now we've got to come to the right understanding of it so adam forfeited it and adam forward it went back to the original owner it belongs to him in john and division i'm just reading number six is which is uh the breach which is 148. sauna ain't just playing with a loud voice who's worthy to open the book but loose the seals thereof god who is that one sitting on the throne the absolutely original holder of the book of life he holds it god does when adam forfeited it went back to its original owner it belongs to him and john and division looked over and saw in the right hand of him that sets up on the throne what the title deed of redemption all right now what kind of a book is that and why does it say a book in revelation 5. but yet in revelation 20 it says books daniel that says books why why does it deal with just one book in the hand of the one sitting on the throne must be a very special book all right look at the next one page 282 67 the sardisian church age to begin with there is no basis for the claims that the lamb's book of life is not the same as the book of life now read with me the book of life might be called the lounge book of life or christ's book of life or even the thy book and book of the living okay now watch what he's saying to begin with there's no basis for the claim that the lounge book of life is not the same as the book of life so if it's loud book of life in the book of life now watch the book of life might be called so if you get into revelations 20 and 12 you'll find that it mentions the book of life right but it mentions books all right christ's book of life or even the book of book and book of the living now watch what he says only names are written in it what kind of a book is it it's a book of names right is that sensible it's a book of names only names are written in it see that's why in revelations 5 you're only dealing with the lamb's book of life eternal sexism that's the names of the bride of jesus christ because that's revelations 3 uh revelations 13 8. drew up on the face of earth whose names are not written in the book of life of the lamb slain from the foundation world now the book of life of the lamb slain from the foundation of the world is the book of redemption and only names are contained in it only names it's the names of the redeemed we'll get to it sunday i don't want to go into that much of redemption we'll come back more to it later because i don't want to don't want to get too far i just want to deal with the names written in the book of life i want to deal with that as the rest of this creation the bride of christ revelations 5 it's just one book it's the book of the lamb that was slain from the foundation of the world and only names are in it you say yeah but brother dale yeah that's the books even in your quran to show how much they can type after in the writing of what's his name the fellow that come up with all of that he has one section written then they have another section written to kind of deal with life but this is the section supposed to be the eternal part because they're trying to type after god and doing his ways but think about it one beautiful book it only contains names that's what you're dealing with in revelations 5 now when you come to revelation 20 you're dealing with books all right now to me there's only one book that can be put down as to understand the book of life or understand books to come back and it's this bible it's the word of god i've got the quotes right in here this bible you say well it's john's did john see him setting up right with the bible in his hand was he the king james or what is a scofield or what you know who was it it's a book of names the names of the redeemed because remember revelation 5 is the calling up and john going up to see it's not the white throne judgment when you get to the white throne judgment of daniel in rome revelation you're dealing with books plural and this bible then has that too it has books this is books it's a book of names but at the same time it tells you about all the other things that are happening when it talks of moses it talks of pharaoh it talks to the good it talks to the bad this bible does right within this bible is books but yet in this bible is also the eternal life section that contains only the names of the redeemed we'll get to that sunday it says well now wait a minute brother my name i can't find my name in the uh in the book you know james is in the book uh you know samuel's in the book i can't find danny right because it's not written out right so it's not just finding samuel in the book there's got to be more to it than that right your prophet said it's not the name written down it's what's going on during the time that you're here is where your name is in the book we'll get to that sunday but think about it only names in this book so what a beautiful book look what he goes on to say now in the first seal number eight you see the book actually was planned and written before the foundation of the world now if you don't believe in predestination before knowledge you sure got lost but by predestination before knowledge he could understand about pharaoh being in the you can understand about him being written in the bible because he's going to be come to earth and make his own choice but think about it you see the book actually was written planned and written before the foundation this book the bible was really written before the foundation of the world what and christ being the lamb was slain before the foundation of the world and the members of his bride their names were put in the lounge book of life before the foundation of the world but it's been sealed up and now it's being revealed whose names were in there all about it what a great thing and john when he saw it he said everything in heaven everything underneath the earth everything heard him saying amen and blessings and honor he just really was having a great time for the lamb was worthy all right so that's revelation 5 right so john you know he was crying and weeping because nobody was worthy to take the book and then the elder spoke and said john said the line is worthy well then when the lion walked out it was a lamb right to take away the sin of the world but then see if my name was ever written we'll get to it more later well let's go ahead and read the next one let's let brother branham answer it number nine paragraph 112 of questions and answers on the sealed 63 3 24 in the morning brother branham is the lounge book of life in the book of life the same book sure because that's where all all redemptions wrote in this book what books they talk about bible right their names are in you say well our names put on the land book of life brother branham i got it put on the other night no you didn't no you didn't come on you just found out it was on there the other night see because their names were written before the foundation of the world that's it's all the same book the loud book of life in the book of life is the same book but what is it then is it two books or is it one book the book is in the hand of the one sitting on the throne only contains names and only deals with one book but at the white throne judgment you're dealing with books one of them is the book of life the other one is the book of our lives come on we'll read what the prophet had to say about it but lock that in until sunday you just found out it was on there the other night you just found it out how'd you find it okay look the next one let's see what the prophet has to say about this works is faith express 1965 11 26 paragraph 119 just like last night speaking when you get the book you're going to see maybe a little confusion there what i said the two books of life watch him it's the same book you're back to one right but one of them is your natural birth you say my natural birth is not in the book paul said and such were some of us and this that and the other and he said we all had our times in the past in the world and the things a lot written in the bible about you and i and how lost we were right it's the same book but one of them is your natural birth the other one is your spiritual birth now i love this one one leads out to the other one here was saul killing the christians right wrote up in the bible the book but then the same man becomes a preacher of the gospel wrote up in the same bible so the bible does show our natural birth and it shows our spiritual birth right right so it's not two books like you know me hold up the bible in one hand and the notebook the other two books because that's what it sounds like when you're in the church age book because that's what he's referring to he's referring back to the invisible union right but it's not two books it's the same book but one of them is your natural birth the other one is your spiritual birth one leads out to the other just like a stalk of wheat whenever you talk to me you talk to me as a living person but there's a part of me here is that person that must perish that's the book that the name comes off of but the eternal one the predestinated one the elected one the name never can come from there because it all was always on it it can never be taken off you'll notice it in the book so to save your confusion you'll find it that way because i think brother vale who put the right grammar to it reminded me of it today i said that's right so he's referring back to the church age book in the church age book it sounds like there's two books but if you'll go back to the church age book you'll find i'll give it to you in just a minute he speaks of two sections he speaks of sections of the book but i'm just trying to get a point to you look at the next one taking the invisible union of the bride of jesus christ 65 11 25. there is your two books one of them is the lounge book of life your name on there is predestinated on there it can't go because you can no more take that away than nothing see because it was for ordained to be on there but the regular book of life you can take that off at any time see you don't repent it's off anyhow because you're going to stand the judgment the bride don't even stand the judgment it goes in the rapture so now think about it is it two books no it's one book so wonderfully written until it contains our lives as sinners and what we were and it contains our lives as christians and part of this new creation new race the prophet spoke of you remember that new creation new race go to your church age book and read a little bit you'll find it i'll be glad to have you after service to find it for you but think about it so if you think he was all messed up in this church age book he said that's where you'd misunderstand so let's read something from the church age book look at number 12. this is page 283 of the sardisian church age which is church age book now then the record of this wheat plant whose end is to be to reproduce the original seed in multiplied form is the book of life i repeat the history or record of this sweet plant is the book of life which is a part of the book of life listen which a part of the book of life is the record of eternal life a section of the book of life there's a section of this bible so wonderful to me that talks about eternal life it tells us what we are right tells us as we've read in romans now what 41 times those who he foreknew he did predestinate those he predestinated he called knows he called he's already justified already right but you know in this same book i find my life but you see the way that we used to be i stay the way we used to be before we heard of this message do you know what we've done we took this book and read it to find out how bad we were and they scared us to death with how bad we were and they threatened us with eternal hells and all forms of things from this book and told us how bad we were until the prophet one day said it like this when he was quoting the scriptures there in in acts where it said men and brethren what must we do to be saved you know what your prophet said we tell them a book of rules we tell them to quit this we tell them to quit that we tell them to quit he said they didn't ask what to do they asked what could they do to be saved he said we tell them what to do trying to make them say by book of rules you know that's what i'm saying right whether you admit it or not you preachers especially out there that are listening you know that when we as an organized religion all we used the bible was for to beat people to death about it try to scare them into hell you know out of hell to try to get them to heaven we preached a bunch of do's and don'ts and this and that and the other oh if you live in good method this doctrine if you're living good when you die remember the message that says you're in you're out there down you're in the up and down if you know the doctor if you die while you saved you okay if you die where you lost shane that's methodist doctrine well where to get that they thought they got out of the book where's that in the book but see when we come in this message and begin to hear what the prophet had to say and to show us the scriptures at least my thinking changed from a book of rules to a revelation of the person of jesus christ living in his life through you and i and giving us a new birth talking about where'd you ever hear a denominational person talk about an unconditional covenant come on i want one where is he one out they didn't talk about unconditional they talked about conditions we see this prophet come along talking about an unconditional covenant and just remember in case you don't believe it that way which came first grace or law come on grace came first grace was in the garden of god killing those animals grace was in the garden of promising not to kill them grace was first law was added because of mankind that wanted a book of rules you see the reason i'm saying that right back up above that quote his wife brother brandon said there's your two books he said because denominations had done this to us they set us into a stage now until people want to know what to be saying quit drinking quit smoking quit chewing come to church pay your tithe make sure you pay your time that's number one you know because you as long as you pay your tithe you can live like the devil and they're going to preach you into heaven when you die right come on you ever heard anybody lately preached to hell you know preached over a body and he died and went to hell i've never heard one all 73 years old i've never heard no preacher then that person died and went to hell you no everybody's going to heaven my brother stephen wilson said they're going to do away with hell does ain't nobody there anymore well i don't think that's right do you ain't nobody in hell no more everybody's in heaven you don't have to do away with hell then but here's the last one i want you to get because i want to make sure to seal it in your mind and see what this book i'm talking about really is because this is taken from the invisible union of the bride of christ 65 11 25 or f308 there is your name on the book of life the book of life is the word of god because the word the word is god and god is the only thing that is life so your name was represented in the bible before the bible became onward and if you're here to do that won't it vindicate that word won't the church vindicate itself won't malachi 4 and all these other things perfectly perfectly vindicate itself and show that's that's what it is the bible can be in the hand of the one sitting on the throne but all we're concerned about of that part is names written in that book when it goes over with daniel in revelations at the white throne it becomes books but there's not many books it's just still the same book this bible tells us of our life and journey of mankind through this world it tells you where you're going and tells you what was going to happen to us it tells us about jesus christ the seed of the woman but it also tells us about the seed of the serpent paul said in corinthians what is it 13 3 is that where it is one yeah where he said bless through the sin this the sceptility of satan like he did eve corrupts your minds from the simplicity that is in christ jesus you think brother dale preaches deep i preach very very very simple but it just takes a simple mind to understand it and a simple mind is the baptism of the holy ghost so if you have trouble understanding me why don't you pray to god and say god help me to understand what could be more simple than to reveal than the fact of jesus christ living in each one of our hearts and our lives what could be more simple than the plan of salvation that it took god to come down i love that quote i gave you the other day where brother brown says they started out of the garden they started out of the garden said god said because of love in his heart he said i love you and no matter what you've done i'm going with you he never stayed in the garden he come right out of that garden to live with you and i down through time to make sure everything works right he's not up in heaven today everybody wants to go to heaven where god is god's not in heaven he's in your heart why can't we believe it come on musicians going brother what kind of a book is it a wonderful book that the bible can be all that i've spoke of it can be our condemnation unto death but it also can be our deliverance unto eternal life all from one book there's not a book in the world could answer to that except the bible he said well my name's not in the bible don't look for it like that look at what's going on to the day you're living now i don't see martin luther in the bible never read it view but you know one day he brought a message of the just shall live by faith that was his name in the book have you saying your name in the book that's the question i'm asking for sunday have you seen your name in the book well brother dave i don't know how to find my name well then we might or to listen to see because if it's that's wonderful a book it's got to have everything in there it shows the birth of the antichrist it shows the birth of jesus christ and the bride has got to give birth to christ to conquer the antichrist abstract title deed an abstract you don't have abstracts for your property no matter how much you think you got you you don't have an abstract you go down to borrow money on property the quick loan or quick quick references they give you 20 years of checking back to see if anybody else owns that i'm just telling you the truth you go down there that's why the cheap when it costs you it's only 20 years run back you pay hundreds of dollars and they'll run that record back for a hundred years but you know the record here in the united states can't be run back to but to what somewhere around 1776. it can't be run back no further because this didn't belong to you and i it belonged to the indians right you think you've got an abstract what blessed god i got a deed to my property i got an abstract you don't have an abstract there is no such thing as an abstract title deed you have to give it back to the indians then you have to give it back who had it before him but you can have an abstract title need of eternal life because a record can be searched all the way back to find out there ain't nothing against you god has made a way to where we can have eternal life and that eternal life is through jesus christ it's not how much we know of the message or how much we know the bible is how much we know of the author of the book as a personal experience not to just say to know him no to know him by revelation as he called your name oh brother you come up to brother wood brother richards years ago i think he's from zimbabwe or somewhere i'm not certain one but his name was kamwadi and he said i heard god call him one day and he said come waddy well that's a very good point he made it personal said come what he and he had that name but you see we're looking for all kind of things trying to figure it out when god has made it so simple through the prophet's message let's stand abstract title deed to give you and i back what adam lost the prophet said what adam lost jesus christ has restored not saying he will restore has restored we've got to hang on to that what do we got brother 3 15 the red book 315 in the red book anybody have a need it is anybody have a name just come and let's see if god is still really do you have that abstract title see this message is the abstract of the bible to see if there's anything against you and i can't find it this message is redemption simply asking for a closer walk with the lord how many here won't say right father thank you for giving that desire down into our sister's heart because it never comes from satan it never comes from anything else it comes from a thought in her mind that she needs a closer walk with you so you know what it means it means sister there is a closer walk to be obtained and all you got to do is just keep walking and walk right into it in jesus name let's go walk right on into it just take it every day and the step at a time take one until you get there oh my brother wants prayer for the little granddaughter to remember that's gotten a hole in the heart and we believe that god can take care of those things right and we're going to pray we're going to give him his prayer claw and just let him take it with him and just place it on the baby's bed and believe it and believe that it'll be all right i'm going to believe that they don't have to operate the bible says ask for the greater things why not why should we accept the fact of anything else if it comes we say thank you lord if we operate we say thank you lord but why can't we say it's over with and believe it it also made a personal you so let's just pray father we ask you lord as we send this prayer cloth you knew before the world ever begun that our brother would come down here and ask you knew that i'd say what i did that we believe that by your stripes this little one is healed of that heart problem father we just ask you to go around make it manifest it's in your hands lord we ask for a personal thing about timbo lord and the situations that we just ask you to come down and make things right lord not that he's doing wrong but yet he needs more of you and maybe he needs to move on and be what you want him to be lord we just committed into your hands asking you to forgive our sins and goddess they'll lead us and delete our brother we believe our brother there that's trying do the best that he can to preach all he can but maybe temple needs to move on so that's up to you lord we're committed to you we ask you to just god in jesus name god bless you brother jesus anybody have any just come on it's coming let's see let's see if god is real let's believe him well i believe if i could see it no that's not right you believe and then it'll take place you don't have to see to believe you believe to see sent a message to our sister her about her back giving her problems and things so our sisters come up and let's just pray and just pray that sister you know that's aaron's wife sarah let's just pray that everything will be all right okay father you laid on our sister's heart when this one called to pray and she's prayed all day lord we know that but we just come together as a group to believe you and the little bride of christ calls out and says reach down father and touch sister sarah's back make all things well because we believe you father and we thank you in jesus name amen anybody else i am father our brother's asking prayer for his mother and truly he loves his mother would like to help her he'd do anything he could to help her but then we just take her and we committed into your hands because we can't do a lot of things we can't heal we can't deliver we can't do but we can believe and we can accept you and believe that you'll take care of everything so now we just send the great holy spirit to our brother's mother there and you just be whatever she has need of because we thank you for it in jesus name amen you believe see churches left up to you and i to believe i got a thought i want to get off crosstalk that's been on my mind for quite a while we believe what the bible says we believe what the prophet has said but is it still just letters on a page or even thoughts in our mind is it alive it is alive in our hearts because i believe it okay amen don't lose that don't give up that believing but see i want my believing to be transmitted into a reality that i see what i'm believing about luther and i can refer to him a lot of times he there's no telling how many times he preached on justification he might have done great series on it of talking about it from reading paul but one day something come off that page into that man's heart and it was the same words he had read many thousands maybe times but it was a letter on a page but then it became alive see we say buy stripes i'm healed and don't stop confessing that because you confess your way into really sometimes we confess our way into believing you know just keep saying it every time the devil gets onto me i said satan buys god stripes i'm healed and somewhere you're gonna have to give up you just keep beating that's all right but somewhere you're defeated because one day i'm going to confess myself right into the fact of it being a revelation and it might be the next time you say it you say buy stripes i'm healed my wife knows that i had trouble with my back and my legs just having a lot of trouble with them i didn't get to hunt a lot because of some of the things didn't want to get out but i kept saying by stripes i'm healed they just walked into it you know i really didn't know when it was gone i just noticed one day it was gone and i wasn't having any trouble oh yeah 72 years old i'm having troubles we all do human right and i'm talking about a reality keep saying it the bible says he makes intercession upon our confession you say you're healed he says you're healed you say you're not healed he says you're not healed he has to say what we say but you know what we're supposed to do is say what he says and he never has said we wouldn't heal he says those who he justified he's already glorified and that's before we ever even thought about being brought into this world as human beings right but yet he said it let's just keep saying it say thank you lord no matter how much sicker you get to say thank you lord you say yeah but brother you've never been sick enough i've been so sick i couldn't say thank you lord i just sat there and said lord come on the scene and do something but then when i get back well enough i'll say lord come on the scene and help me because sometimes you get so sick brother john martin said that yours are going to help me he said sometimes you're so sick you need somebody to pray for you he said because you can't even pray for yourself you ever been that sick you ever been to a place that you was down and so sick and so hurting do you couldn't pray i've been there danny you've been there right you see he never left me he never left me and he's always been there do it that way sometimes well i better tell i don't i don't want to be a liar if i say i'm healed and i'm not healed i'm lying you are a liar to start with that ain't even in the word of god there's no such thing in the word of god to make a negative confession that the sick say there well right let the redeemed say so i thought we believed the scripture where it said if with a heart man believeth unto salvation but the mouth he confesses itself unto it right i thought that was in the bible let's just keep confessing it right father we thank you lord for this day and your love unto us we thank you for calvary the greatest thanksgiving we could ever have is to just thank you and just say lord we love you thank you for leading us into thy word thank you for revealing your word and to us thank you for showing it lord thank you for being you thank you for walking with us thank you for coming out of the garden when we were put out and just being out here with us lord bless them god each one take care of everybody on the way home give safe journey let your love be with each one in jesus name amen you're just missed time is filled with swift transitions build your hopes on things god's unchanging hair your hopes on things when your journey is
