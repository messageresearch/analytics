TRANSCRIPT
========================================
we got a few hours they go to Danny see remember Bob they're in mobile riding gave your teaching trench go for the ones that are not here boy granite not here like I say it with me catch the lathe my mouse will play being way too look we got to hate sister Barbara cheers brother brother than reality sentences and the kids were spread in his abdomen so they recommended hospice and Cheryl Excel and then remember the Dale family of the Luallen family and Eddie's of one of the older sisters are still alive passed away last night we'll have to be at a funeral or viewing cup of ACE it just keeps all be fresh so anyway good how sister Irene Willis from the Philippines brother burn my Miley got her over here the United States and she's never found so far so far yeah okay she's she just wait lady I said it online we've got a big trip let every soul be subject to the higher power now we're still in the book of Romans and we didn't get very far last Sunday but maybe we'll get this chapter 13 finished then every soul be subject to the higher powers for there is no power but of God that's what we're talking about that Sunday a little bit there is no power but of God there's only our segment only has permitted power God permits Satan to working around because God can't go against his word and it made Satan The Anointed chair right he's the one making that so he's anointed and he's a cherub and he was the right-hand man of God before he about says iniquity was found in his heart so doc can't take that away from him but he's gonna get rid of him the gun yes and but there is only one power and as of God right the powers that be are ordained of God so what's Paul telling us there is no power of God so there's no power but God hears to be here's the power all right then underneath that he's got all these different levels everybody got that because the powers that be are ordained of God so any other power you talk about is ordained of God even Satan's power yes it's ordained of God from the grounds they wanted to drive us to Christ and then because he knew we would fall us think a little bit yesterday you know he didn't make this fall but he knew we'd thought when he put out a man even flesh he knew that fleshly part was would overtake Adam and Eve and they went against their whole inside being they went against everything they'd seen before and even in watching the animals procreate and you would think it out of an even get an idea before even Satan come in you know but they brother man said they were covered with the Holy Ghost Baylor next that's what we're going back to we're not going back to that they had a Holy Ghost veil and how many clothes on but you got to remember once we come through sin and get you dip down into flesh and we come back up out of the flesh and go into the into the future home or even into the body change he's going to change these bodies that we got so he's put white robes on us you know so that we can have that holy ghost veil back on this that's why I was thinking about this do you was mention of them about more well about a religion that I know very well killed they had two girls that work with me that were both devout Mormons I'm going to say but they wore an undergarment and that was their coverage that was our Holy Ghost that was their they wore a complete lucky Union too we have gold Union suits you know they'd wear that and that was there covering underneath them to keep them pure well it didn't work the only power debate is the one you can't see and that's the one in the Holy Ghost that's the one to devil not just cover - right here we want it to go all the way in and work its way back out right so the powers that be are ordained of God even look therefore whosoever therefore resisteth the power resisteth the ordinance of God Miller words the Bible said if you can't take correction you're what a bastard child so when the Lord's you're over here with with the Satan group right cuz two groups of people brother brown said you're either born again okay you're either childhood dog little put child you're either childhood dog or your child of the devil there's no in-between there's no tweeners in him come on brother Dennis getting with a fire follow me but this is where were therefore resisteth the power resisteth the ordinance of God now that's what we did in our life as a center we resisted the very thing that that would help us man we resisted that power now that didn't make God's power in last because you're still a free moral agent even Satan everybody has a free moral agent let's don't get into this but if some thought to think about even an angel has a free moral agency yes though they're not humans because remember Satan's told of a lie and a third of the of the third of the of the Angels body and that was the Fallen Angels but now part I'm dead you've got that person that person a person that angel that's with you I brother day opens on that brother never said God gives us all an angel that's not fallen angel that Angels have come straight from God to protect the children of righteousness to protect us through life other than that boy look what look at how we were we didn't know it but we had an angel it's like brother branham always said it's not some little spot or some eternal something inside of you it was an anointing to me it's an anointing that was around you even when you were sin remember brother Brown said you know you bet Center you do something wrong you get them convicted a little more than the other guy the other guy was just ran up here and corrals and all that didn't bother him ain't still doesn't bother but you and I they always run loose will tell you even everybody that walked in the flesh for a while there was always something that says hey that's not right there was always some little check you know well to me that was that anointing maybe not just a there's not a I don't think I don't know if there's an angel you know creeping around behind you could be I don't know good thing but there's an anointing around you at birth because if God knew you were gonna receive the new birth in a certain time you had to make it to that spot and don't you think that guy out there knows it and he's gonna try to stop you he's what it's creeper me yes like by the way says that when he leaves he said I'm gonna do something that the devil will never do I'm gonna leave you so that's what and that's true they sayings right there all the time but we have that fire around us like I was preaching on the other day we have that fire around us that anointing that keeps us now you don't make us do right no that's right because that will take away your free moral agency that will take away your God ship your your God your year God's right it will take that away so but now they can influence you because weather man said Satan Shayne's him for his power workmen anoint you and tries to what diverts you into another direction but if you're a child I'm your gonna come at God strong use a child you're gonna come so they he does put a protection around you then when that protection goes inside to you as the baptism of the Holy Ghost didn't then you walk catch the person ye are God's still right you just become a child of God not a child of the devil because you were you were you were potentially a child of God when you were doing those wrong things but you weren't a child of God when you were doing them called the child of God won't do that so you got to keep that separate that Satan anointed you but you had an anointing Colette's was fighting brother Brown says remember the greatest battle ever fought in your mind it's not something you can see warfare futile bigger guns that's what man Superman has perverted that into trying to build a bigger gun a bigger bomb a bigger something to destroy more people when when when they see them two prophets over there when we leave with him to prophets go to Israel when empty profits go to Israel and they're standing there just to human mortal man and they're calling fire they're calling earthquakes they're calling this they're calling that all now like we're getting ready to talk in the sixth seal when they bring all that man the people ain't going to understand these cuz they don't want to know where's your weapon you know where's this secret lab that you've you've created this power that you can call you know fire down and just kill thousand the people that attack them well it comes from within because the Bible says fire proceeds from their mouth literal fire but what being able to call and there's a power behind them because see they're anointed to do a job they're not anointing to be the Bride of Christ you and I are anointed to be the Bride of Christ anybody change take a resurrection take a resurrection body change rapture yeah right they have an anointing the two properties will get into the 60s something a little bit more of their anointing to do one thing call 144,000 out now ever how it happens we know what happens that they you know they keep all these nations are want to kill them you know like I said they've all got these spies that it won't kill these two guys and I'm gonna be able to kill them till the 1260 days is over they'll have that anointing to me it's the same anointing and that's something we need to get into maybe a little bit later we come about a morning maybe we talk about later in the seventh seal because I believe that's what is me there was anointing on Jesus where he couldn't die he didn't become God on the River Jordan the Holy Ghost didn't come inside I mean the Bible said it came on me what for his three and a half year message ministry where they would try to tell anything will try to throw him off the cliff and the Bible says he walked through right through the crowd same waves got even and Elijah Elijah standing there going there's more for us than they are against us and days us going one two one two one two then he said o open my service eyes and then he saw what chariots of fire angels way more than thou army was right well that see that's what it wasn't a lot Elisha was in that that those angels were in that other dimension making sure Elijah he finished his job yeah same way with Jesus because remember even when Jesus went into the went into the forty days into the wilderness the Bible said that angels ministered to him then he said when he went in the garden against them when they said angels ministered to him right comforted him right because in the Garden of Gethsemane that power left him that 1260 days of the mastery of Jesus left him so he could die so you couldn't die well that will an anointing on it so that's what I see if we come to that anointed that same anointing which lists the seals that's what he is this he was to sail a sail preaching did that dream have your message that he preached came over to a little profit in the end time brother Brown his 1260 days of preaching from 1962 basically was 1965 right that Nordine lifted off of him and he had to pass away because he was prophetic he prophesied of a group of people to come but now you and I are gonna have that anointing I believe if we come to that place of the seventh seal we're going to have that power that anointing that we can't die and we're just gonna go right into into a body change right incorrectly we would you're alive in your mind right shall not prevent or hinder those with your sleep yeah but you see once the seals start opening to you you can put it in every scripture that's my brother Munson Bobby teff brand-new book that's why I said if you don't see Christ in every person well who is the seventh seal Christ is the seal so you must see Christ even in here yes right whosoever they're resistant to power resistance the ornaments who've done or next is ordination or ordained you are ordained for something your brother I said one guy ordained for one sermon John the Baptist ordained for just a little bit in short time six months preaching no miracles but he was ordained to introduce Christ Jesus man all right in the flesh and they that resist shall receive to themselves damnation all right so if you stay on here you know what you're gonna get but if you come over here because what Paul he says for rulers are not a terror to good works rulers but to evil well now then not be afraid of the power see where we're supposed to have a reverent fear of God but we're not supposed to fear God I love the Bible says fear God you're not supposed to fear Him in the way we think feelings man okay there's a holy fear and reverence that we know he's up here and he's the Creator okay that's this man's problem he thinks he can supersede yourself up to here right right but now when the very man that standed though watch this when the very man they said it takes this group of people and puts us right here that's right now you put him about I ain't putting somebody right I put him in that's right and put us above him we're not we can't be above the Creator right but when he says we are gods when he says work God made manifest in another form called a bribe that's what he said then the Creator can do whatever he wants to yeah so we are ordained not to damnation we're not to rule with terror well now then not be afraid of the power you've seen that rulers really put fear in the people and keep you watch suppressed say a ruler will do that Satan that's what he does he tries to keep then everybody down here God's trying to get everybody back up every day hey man God's trying to get us back up to where he is a true ruler will do that all right you know how did he do that he came and died so that we could get back up there all right do that which is good and thou shalt have praise of the same in other words what for he is the minister of God to thee for good right in other words whoever King today excuse me he that which is good I shall have praise of the same for he is the minister of God now who's the minister of God not Sam Dale it's not Vernon Manhattan it's got its name this God God is gonna preach it because this man gets up and preaches it's just money that's right but there's an ordination or there is a there is a way for us to get back in it's called a ministry a fivefold ministry to get us perfected this brings us back to here so for he is the minister of God to thee for good that's my brother Brown said if your pastors are off the word that's the only reason you leave now cuz you got a bad song service not called the personal side you smell bad not because you don't like this by the other no it's joke because of the word if he's preaching the word you need to focus on the word cuz that's what's gonna change your body not all this other frivolous stuff that to me that's your privilege junk that you know what that is that's not God yes God is not the author of confusion so let's divide this there is no confusion on this side of the line there's total confusion on this side along so if there is any confusion is over here on this side right but if thou do that which is evil be afraid for he beareth not the sword in vain for he using the minister of god it didn't say a SSD she was talking about the Holy Ghost see you can say a minister says the minister and a revenger to execute wrath upon him that doeth evil now in other words you continue to do this you're gonna get that's what I say you get an inheritance one way the other you got an inheritance on this side like fire you got it here it is on this side keep your home eternal life and this is totally eternal separation I didn't say eternal life I save you separation of once you get on this side you can't go back get your seal well you can't go back all right a remainder to ask you to rap on him to do is evil wherefore ye must needs to be subject not only for wrath but also for conscience sake in other words I've seen churches split and I've seen problems in other churches where a person sits in the congregation and thinks they can do a better job than they got standing up in the pulpit that's where you get split yeah you subjected yourself not to the higher power you subjected yourself to this guy right now it's the now listen though if the preachers in pulpit preaching polygamy in two lords and Trinity doctrine then you're supposed to leave him and do what you do but if the man's preaching the Word of God in the pulpit every Sunday every Wednesday if he's preaching the word line-by-line then if there's somebody in them in the congregation that thinks they do a better job see that's where you get and that really comes up complication well I think I do bear jovem he does so I just don't we'll take some people humble go start me in the church go back to the question is he preaching the truth he's preaching the truth why do you think you preach it burn he can let's see we have to be 70 and listen that's your problem in mine we hate authority of the human being come on they don't like Authority as human being we do not like somebody to tell us what to do you know who that is he didn't like for God to tell you what to do Yeah right they did that's why I said iniquity was found in what he thought he could supersede yourself and get somehow get up here cuz state remember Satan likes numbers he likes together millions together and thinks by groups of people he can he can overtake stuff then you got two prophets walk out with seven billion people in the world who prophets walk out of knowing where the Holy Ghost to do to do a job and they can't touch him for 1260 days they say my knowing is gonna be on them then when I'm morning lift off of them they're gonna be killed then they're gonna take a rapture so come on you kind of get the trend you'll not die a day before God's on you if you're a Christian the day before God finished with you are they after you'll go today God is finished with you on this earth and if you're a Christian and the child of God you should say I don't wanna stay enough no no extra right well there is some that are dying not to see that there's someone we must have that mentality that there is somebody that's not going to die somebody duck death will be conquered on this side in this dimension that's gonna be conquered and when it is then it's going to bring all the other ones out of the grave all right well we've run into a ran into a doctrine in the Philippines things there's about that close to the truth Nicaragua sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry Nicaragua baits that close to the truth but that's they and they literally going to walk out to the grave and call the person in the you know the no words the grounds gonna pop open and the person's gonna raise up ugly they're gonna physically raise the data I don't think that's true because it's got to be all secret got to be a secret coming this this is a secret coming across that nobody in the world knows that people dismiss people that have the truth of this message let me say that people have the truth of this message I just believe one day we'll be preaching the true Word of God and anointing is gonna fall and we're not gonna I don't think physically go out to the grave and scream and holler we'll just be coming to a place we'll come to a position to where they'll just start walking among us and they'll just come walking in and and we'll recognize them and I don't think Robert Tatum which was a deacon here and a longtime member here I don't think he's gonna go too making and walking that church no he's gonna come among the people that you know the people that you know are gonna come among the people that have been known while they were alive yeah and that to me that's to me that's a wonderful thing kolima brother Graham the angel remember in the when he went to the time he said you be gathered with your people Paul's not gonna be going with brother Browns people Paul's gathered with his people in a dimension inside of dimensions and we've already studied that with you there's Paul did not see brother Branham in brother Brown did not see Paul cuz he said it did Paul make it now if he was if I was looking at broker in another dimension boat-car walls up would be brother Colonel make it no let's don't think that way he didn't see Paul calls together with his people Iranians his going with his people because how did those people that brother branham song get into that dimension the angel told him your ministry your message these are your people all Browns no converts all right so they will convert to William Browns message sorry to Jesus Christ's message drew William Randall but it was in that slide that everybody did we come into the higher power see that's where people try to shoot proceeding and get in front of brother Brown well he's young he only knew this now we know more no he was a seventh angel prophet major problem Amen God garden he'll have a one shot down right down nobody in between but see that's the how are you let he accepted Jesus Christ is the head I don't mind calling it hard because Jesus Christ is the head and it must not be a problem with it even in the future home because the Bible says Kings will come in well now you got to be a kingdom you don't have a kingdom to be a king keys are gonna come in to the city and get to leave off the tree and go back well now who's you gonna take it back to the people that he had Oh chip over now how that is I don't know because I got one thing for sure I heard Monty put us in the city and we got one bride in one bridegroom and 144,000 to work around in the city but this just gonna be us in that City which is the wonderful thing so then we know who our head just like we know you know well that we're married to Christ and Christ as their head he's our hierarchy but now what he's done is brother Brian even said that we become deity yes but that's what God said mm-hmm what he would become did all right we we are God on this earth because remember thank God and the Holy Ghost you got inside of you it's not two different people same person amen it's just in a different place right all right well that would not even get all right okay wherefore you must needs be subject we've got to be subject Paul says while subject yourself to your husband's now not totalitarian rulership you do this are you going to get one of these you know well you know what the Bible says the way you treat your wife the way God treats you so God's gonna be doing this to you if you don't be careful so treat your wife right treat your husband right and everything you'll be good all right hey man yeah wherefore you must need to be subject not only for wrath but also for conscience sake let me just move a point in here Rebecca was coming my Gary being gone for four years she has a head her heads Christ see watch Paul Paul says I would that you not even marry why because come on let's be honest as human we got God our husband and then the bride natural natural Jim is 72 me and I'm certain to cry all right but Paul says if you won't get married then you're subject to God so that's your subject to go so it leaves it to where that a single wife or even a wife they don't have one husband this this server the message your head shift Christ and policy that would be good if you could do that but now you got to be careful because we're gonna read this if we ever get down to the very bottom says but put you on the Lord Jesus and make not provision for the flesh to fulfill the lust thereof because that's the problem with some certain church not letting their priests married yeah they get troubled little boys why because of the lust of the flesh there's no holy ghost in any person hey alright with that I'm you ready let's just be honest we were put here procreate we were put here with that sensuality part but a lot of times we you have to be careful there's a fine line but wait it's not me do what it's not the GP be either after the husband dies the other words does not God the pastor then the bride no no if guys you you're right there with you know you're at the but sometimes some people will be like well you know your husband is dead I'm your pastor so I'm your heads now and then yeah you have to be careful laugh yeah cuz a lot of times didn't you hear about a year later that preachers got about four of them in the congregation and they're not just spiritual heavy anymore you understand what I mean yeah okay so we have to be careful keep it separate pastor is your spiritual head sure okay but but he's not to be he's not the superseded step between you and crime right if he's speaking their this Christ talking to you so you know you go back to that but that's true we have to watch even Paul Paul was not married okay gonna have a wife need have children but he knew the lust of the flesh company was tell people just like the down here the bottom listen it's better to marry than to burn but if you can stay single being eunuch to Christ and stay single why because you can give more time to God I mean really let's be truthful if you got a husband we all we all have needs wash my clothes do always right but if you don't have all that you just do your thing and then you know then you then you can pray that's one bit that I believe brother Brown knew that that's why a lot of times he said my success is some little or some sister getting in the closet bragging that he sent that so God must have showed him that they were sincere and praying for the meetin and knock all this other stuff but then I go back to John Wesley's mama Johnny chose West's mother had 13 kids she raised two at least to God the ones out of it and she had time to read the Bible to them and everything else and she watched thirteen thirty dollars well got the thing but you were 13 pegs close she didn't have a maytag she was out there doing this on the washboard you know and I'm sure the kids were like all of us they weren't very clean yeah they get muddy clothes they keep the clean you don't say I won't answer you make time for what you may come for for this cause pay ye tribute also so you must pay tribute we know that brother Dale is our pastor so there's really no there's no question right and his head is Christ and I've had this cross when it comes to the spiritual part so we have no problem with that it's when you supersede one brother branham say when we get in our position know your position if you're a finger be the best finger you can be you know if you if you go to if you can't preach and you can't do these things you can at least an appealing breath all right worship and bring the spirit week and when you come not well bring the whole experience they don't bring the spirit week for their thoughts ministers attending continually upon this very thing render therefore to all their dues tribute to whom tribute is due custom to whom custom and what's he telling he's telling them you got a pastor believe in you pastor believe in a fivefold ministry fear to whom fear honor to new honor it's pretty simple oh no man anything all right but to love one another for he that loveth another hath fulfilled the law for their staff shalt not committed three thou shalt not kill thou shalt not steal thou shalt not bear false witness thou shalt not covet and if there be any other commandment it is briefly comprehended in this one saying if there's any other commandment thou shalt love thy neighbor as one is telling you life Sunday that's the hardest thing you can do it's love the people that hate you it's the easy to come to church and love the people that love you but go out in the world and love those people that literally hate you right so but you gotta love them with the same love that you love our brothers and sisters that's why that's two like I said that's right there right before you get up to the headstone to me that's the hardest one that's the hardest one to comprehend is to love somebody that would literally hate you and love them with godly love don't guess now I'll let you don't just out let me handle it I love the fish but dang I have to do with love God okay right filial love agape love both of em you know he sectioned those all off love worketh no ill to his neighbor therefore love is the fulfilling of all the law because if you love one another you're not gonna kill and do all these things I here committed or could kill still bear false witness covet you're just not going to do that if you if you have love they've got the love of God in your heart and that knowing the time now it is high time go without sleep that's 2,000 years ago that was written okay it's high time now that we wake out of sleep for now is our salvation nearer then when we believe and we all know that ostensibly we're closer to the rapture of the Nerds of the body change or in the resurrection than we ever have them before each day right the night is far spent the day is at hand let us therefore cast off the works of darkness and let us put on the armor of life well as the armor love joy peace longsuffering all those and these okay let us walk honestly as in the day not in rioting and drunkenness not in chambering and wantonness not in strife and envying but putting it on the Lord Jesus Christ and make not provision for the flesh to fulfill the lust thereof all right let's look on here see what just we're writing means it means revelry we know what drunkenness is chambering means what's sin see if this these will help with that well look right here well let me say what you know stop Aaron what does it mean define hello here we go define second day of the trial following subsequent succeeding strong huh yeah the strong one we read one strong but it was licentiousness that's a strong jump there yeah that's wrong anyway some people look up and we know what one is it's just lewdness not in strife and envying but put you on the Lord Jesus cons made no provision for the flesh to fulfill the lusts thereof we finally got through Romans 13 now remember like I said before we're reading this as not chapters man put those characters in here this is not chapter 14 Paul is writing a letter and he's continually writing to the Romans what we've done is we couldn't break in they're human beings put a break in that but what his whole thought was what but you on the Lord Jesus Christ no provision for the flesh to fulfill the lust thereof him that is weak in the faith so just keep going him that is weak in the faith receive ye but not to doubtful disputations in other words don't some right bring somebody in a week what does it mean what does listing businessmen promiscuous promiscuous don't be for I think that was probably close okay don't figure that was been there somewhere close to it because lascivious is lasciviousness and all that stuff together so in this weak in the faith receive ye but not to doubtful disputations other words here's the problem when we bring us Christian in we fill them full of brother Brown we need to fill them full of Christ brother Ram didn't save tell you how much a message you know he should tell them how you fire got let Christ lift your fire brother round in man yeah so that that's what that means if you bring in somebody new into the faith don't just keep brother Browns here brother I'm saying brother I'm saying they can't listen if they get the Holy Ghost I guarantee you they don't know what brother Brown said okay like the problem is we bring them in and put them in the message don't do this do this don't do that don't do this don't believe don't believe don't this bottle says repent and be baptized name of Jesus Christ get them to repent get them to be baptized name Lord Jesus Christ then they'll receive the Holy Ghost right a man right that's a promise to receive the Holy Ghost after you've been baptized after you've repented and then little sit and listen but don't sit there what's the problem you bring people in and don't have in this church but other church they bring them in they're just feeling full I'm sorry that's just the way it is and then some little something they'll hear well he might have been wrong over here or he might he might he might a bit him when they listen to the Lord Jesus Christ one thing he never was wrong he didn't say I'll almost be with the Holy Ghost he said I'll fill you with the Holy Ghost and I'll teach you things to come I'll be the one that teaches you jerk right and then if they don't get the holy ghost before that then you've just bruised fruit you just got somebody just pushes it all away but let them see Christ and then but that's the problem to you doubtful doubtful disputations is what happens now you bring them in and you you don't even have to just hear it from the pulpit you just somebody you know you know saying well we're gonna take this brother I people wouldn't take brother I need to tell them how about the pastor is to tell them how bad this thing's how bad this is going on what's going bring them in and be channel with their babies and then be gentle with the babies all right let's go we'll start with four Phoenix [Music]
