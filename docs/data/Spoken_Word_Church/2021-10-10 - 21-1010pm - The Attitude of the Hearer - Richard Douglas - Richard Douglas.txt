TRANSCRIPT
========================================
i know it's i've been wanting to kind of get down to georgia and see what it's like so uh i'm actually thoroughly impressed uh it's very beautiful down here uh great church here um and uh i definitely enjoyed my stay with the black family i actually fly out tonight so keep me in your prayers and hope i don't get lost but it's it's really been a great time to be here um definitely love love seeing all the believers and all the southern accents you all are just so kind so but uh i don't get a lot of that back home so i like talking like a southerner so um but quick testimony before i i don't i don't want to be here up here all day and i know i have a um kind of disability of talking too much so um but actually back home um i know i had been asking god for a while that he'd help me be a better witness i think that's all of our prayers um but a witness being a witness to me it's just i've always been wanting to do that in a greater way and i actually i was at the park at about 11 o'clock at night with some friends and it was something like you'd see in like a haunted movie like two guys come out of the shadows like outside of the trees and i didn't i didn't really think anything of it at the moment but one of the gentlemen sat down on the bench near the basketball court the other one started talking to me asking me where i went to school and i was i was telling them like everything about me like where i was from like what i what i did what i wanted to do and um the the brother that was out on the bench he kind of overheard me so when the guy i was done when he was done talking to me um the guy on the bench came over to me and he he started he started kind of asking the same questions and kind of making sure i was telling the same thing to him and he asked me if i knew somebody at the school i went to i was like yeah yeah i know him he's like well i'm his uncle so it was like we kind of got acquainted there and he asked me if i partied with him i was like you know sir i'm i'm a christian i don't party and he his whole demeanor changed he started tearing up and he he told me that he had actually been a christian he'd felt he's fallen he's fallen away and he asked he'd recently asked god if he could send somebody to him to help him bring him back to him and to me he he told me i may i me i may be that guy maybe not but he just felt like he should talk to me so i talked to him for until about actually 1 30 in the morning that was a long night for me but it was well worth it he repented and he he surrendered his life to christ right there on the bench and i started picking him up taking the church [Applause] he was definitely very um open to the word and you don't see a lot of that nowadays so um it said he's his name is brother donnie

opportunity appreciate brother dale like a dad to us and i told him i was his redheaded step-son and he he stuck with me i've been adopted into the family amen we sure appreciate being part of the family of god i'm thankful that he hand picked us amen for this hour and he chose us and predestinated us and nothing that satan can do or say and changes from what we are i'm glad of that and we sure appreciate the lord for appreciate each and every one of you i'd like to go home with each and every one of you but i don't think y'all could feed me sir i won't put that burden on you amen it's

you're down in the valley don't lose faith for your never alone for the god on the mountain is still god in the valley when things go wrong he'll make them right and the god of the good times still gone in the bad times the god of the day is still god in the we talk of faith when [Music] we're upon the mountain but talk comes so easy when life's at its best but it's down in the valley of trials and temptations that's when faith is really put to the test sing it with me for the god on the mountain is still god in the valley when things go wrong he'll make them right and the god of the good times is still god in the bad times the god of the day is still god in the night amen amen troubles night or day or winds or rain does not change him he's still god he still he's got his position he's still on the throne still making an intercession for us still still there nothing changes him nothing catches him by by surprise sometimes we get caught off guard god's never caught off guard he already knows what the devil's going to do before he doesn't he's already or preordained him to do it i told him i said this fight's rigged i said he's already told him what to do and how to do it and he's already got the counter punch for him so i'm thankful god's always in control of everything we sure appreciate you i'd like to you stand for the reading of the word with me i'd like to turn over to the book of james chapter one i'd like to take a little thought tonight the attitude of the hearer the attitude of the hearer ain't you glad god helps us with that that's one thing we all need a little adjustment with sometimes is our attitude you know we always say you need attitude adjustment god knows how to adjust our attitude in order to determine our altitude sometimes we don't fly no higher than our attitude so i'm glad god takes care of us start verse 22 james chapter 1 verse 22. he said be ye doers of the word and not hearers only he said deceiving your own selves for if any man be a hearer of the word and not a doer he's like unto a man beholding his natural face in a glass for he beholdeth himself and goeth his way and straightway forgetteth what manner of man he is but whosoever looketh into the perfect law of liberty continueth therein he being not a forgetful hearer but a doer of the work this man shall be blessed in his deed father lord jesus we're looking in the mirror again and father lord we're looking lord and we're asking you to help us lord because father a man can only do so much lord and father i've done as much as i can do lord now i'm asking you lord now to come and use the little gift you've given me lord and let me get out of your way lord let me just be a microphone that's mute lord and you speak through my lips lord that father we'd have a testimony upon our hearts and in our lives when this all would come to an end lord this service and we'd have a testimony did not our hearts burn within us as you spoke to us along the way now granted lord and we'll give you the praise honor and glory for we ask you in jesus christ's name amen and amen you may be seated the attitude of the hearer james is telling us here he's telling us to be doers of the word not hearers only a lot of people hear but very few do it's like when you're a child sometimes your parents will tell you you need to take the garbage out and you heard them say it but you didn't do it so there's a penalty for that when you don't when you don't do what you hear the same way with god god tells us we're sons and daughters of god we look into this mirror and god tells us by his his order his word to tell us we are now sons and daughters of god we've not changed our position god has not changed his thoughts he's eternal god he never changes in any way he said i hear you o israel i'm the lord thy god and i change not so he changes his not in his thoughts but a lot of times we hear what the word says about us we look at the word brother sam we study the word we believe the word but then we forget that we are part of the word we're just we hear sometimes but we fail to react the right way toward the word like we should we fail to respond we fail to have the right attitude and i believe the prophet told us he said the right mental attitude toward any divine promise will bring it to pass so it's not god's attitude toward his word he's already said what he said he would do and he'll do just what he says it's our attitude and how we approach his word we say lord we may not understand it but god we're going to believe it anyway we're going to do it because you said we are when we look into this mirror of the word of god we look in the mirror and it says i'm a son you are now sons and daughters of god not going to be not might be you already are and if we could ever get to that situation we're into that position that with revelation knowing who we are then brother said when we get in our position recognize who we are and recognize those two spirits working within the framework then and withstand them a lot of people recognize the spirits working within the framework but with standing he says satan will become powerless see satan wants us to have the attitude well we can go we went this far but that's good enough he's like that's great i want you to stop right there because you're not going on to withstand me but i'm here to tell him this morning this afternoon take notice on him we're here and we're going to withstand you we're going to fight back we're going to press toward the mark of the high calling in christ jesus we are here because we are overcomers paul said he causeth me to triumphant he made us winners he said you'll overcome by the word of your testimony and the blood of the lamb the blood of the lamb is sufficient it's the it's the sustainer it's the power giver the life that was in the blood come back upon us as believers we are more than able well sometimes we take the attitudes down let's just look at the children and the children the hebrew children just from it here they are and here they are in egypt they've been in there 400 years they've read the scrolls they what the prophet said they'd be there 400 years and god would raise up a deliverer to deliver them out here he goes get and starts dealing with the man that he thought he was a brother terence he thought he was a failure he thought he'd missed it he thought he was done for he went in he was in it raised in egypt 40 years and the only thing he did by his own ability was kill one stinking egyptian so here he goes out into the desert discouraged defeated beat up sometimes we go into a dead or sometimes to recognize we're still what god said we was we just don't realize we don't know the reason we went there because we didn't go the right way the first time so he's trying to get us focused back on him he's the answer to it so here here's this here's the prophet no other one i i guarantee you moses walking around well lord my mother told me this and and by the scripture said it i was going to be the woman lord i messed this thing up something's happened maybe i ain't the right one maybe i'm not the one that's supposed to be doing it and until to understand he ate the one but he had to yield his vessel to be used to be done that so here he comes but i love how the scripture he said and he's seen that flame up on the mountain but he said something happened something happened there when he turned his attitude changed he turned aside to see what was going on sometimes god has to get us in the place of a desert into a place of heartache and trouble sometimes to get us to turn aside to see where the main source is coming from he had to meet the pillar fire for himself and when he turned aside and went to see what was going then he had his commission he had done he received the voice of the sign and he and when he told him what to do and he made all kinds of excuses his attitude was still wavered a little bit he said well i can't speak good uh i'm not eloquent of speech make god mad i mean you know we try to make all kinds of excuses we try to give god all kind of attitude you know and like brother brown said he said when a man god has to chase every man down he calls to preach i mean sometimes i get word when the man says i want to be a preacher and i always tell him i want you to if that's what you want to do do it but i mean is that what god wants you to do i mean if it's god calling you you can't get away from him when god calls you automatically your thing is as a human being it's to run it's a rhyme and say lord not me not me lord there's many more qualified many more men should use it call what pick one of those but then when you meet that pillar of fire and he gives you a commission he said moses take his shoes off i'm going to show you something moses that i can step into you and i'm going to be the deliverer see what he did he wanted to take complete control of moses he took control of his failures he took control of his faults he took control of his mistakes he changed his whole attitude and then here comes an 80 year old man no longer with the sword no longer with the human ability to fight and defeat the egyptian all he had was a little stick it was a one-man invasion and here he goes down and where are you going moses if you look at me like now now lord you're going to use him but he had got to the place to where he had used himself up that where god could use him he knew that he had no more ability anymore he had no way to do anything within himself that's the way we have to come to god say god i'm used up there's nothing left that i can use to help you all i can do is surrender myself completely to you so here he goes down walks up to pharaoh let my people go in favor looks at him like wow this guy's back he's back he run like a coward and here he is back again he said i said let my people go so here he throws down his stick and it becomes a snake pharaoh says we got those we got people to do that you know what i wonder about a lot of people have challenged this message but they don't even have the sticks of janice and jamers they have nothing to throw down to match it nothing to match it but little when when satan tried to match it it was consumed by the original thought that god had he swallowed the other serpents picked it back up the hebrew children heard of this he stick his hand in his side pull it out and it'd be to have liberty put it back and he'd be healed again they'd seen those things god brought all those plagues on god brought every one of those plagues on him to humble pharaoh and here's the children of israel their attitude they go out there they don't even get probably a hundred miles away from egypt right to the red sea and it's like less out here to die boy what kind of leader are you moses boy you made a mistake right here we stand we can't look who's behind us do you realize that's the greatest army that the world has seen in our day they're ready they're right here on us they're affecting the consumers and you led us right here they failed to see who was leading them they failed to see god was using moses they had attitude you're and they went right back you failed us again moses and they thought well maybe maybe god made a mistake bringing him calling him to lead us out here but he said stand still and you'll see the salvation of god just take time take notice what god's doing give god a chance when he said he'd do something he'd do it so here he stretches forth his rod you ain't never seen a sea open before here they go across the red sea open up dry land two million people walk across it i imagine the kids was touching the waters they go looking at the fish swim by never seen it before get on the other side here comes the egyptians they didn't slow down god moved the pillar fire and went in front of them here they come they got in there and god said that's just what i wanted see if you can if that's not the provided way for you you're drowned if you're just following this message and not a part of it you'll drown in the red sea because here he come and he knocked the wheels off the chariots they fell in there and then guess what here comes the water here come the water and it drowned in them they drowned it there they got the tamarind got the tamarind they shouted they sung the song and he said you'll see them no more no more will you see them how many times does our enemy attack try to attack us that god would slay it and we see him no more and then here we go right on further with it and their attitude changed so quickly because they're not he's not they think god's not doing what they want to do they're going there said you let us out here today we're going to thirst to death then you say god drowned him why could god not give you water but their attitude we've got to be careful with our attitude toward god and what he's doing they look and see and they've seen this and they still said you led us out here to die this water's bitter so he doesn't he throws to stick into the water water go on we're going to die again i mean what faith what confidence where is people's faith at where was their confidence in and what god said here i'm going to deliver you i'm going to take you to a land flowing with milk and honey here they go in their journey again god rub caused the rock moses smites the rock drink the water two million people drinking out of rocks think about it i mean wake up that just don't happen every day i i've hit many rocks and they didn't know water come out of them and then they say that oh then later on we got number water we're hungry what you're going to feed us we're going to die what's our attitude many times we go from what a brother brown says we're either coming out of a trial or going into one and here they go into the next feed us angels start cooking food they feed man they eat man they even try to hide it and it spoils them you got to have a fresh experience with god every day what you had yesterday will not supply you today you got to have a fresh source every day they eat that and they get tired of the manna man i bet that was the best my i can't imagine how good that was they eat them oh we're tired of it give us some meat hear the complaining again give us some meat so god said okay send you quail i now quail for two million people i've nev i've i've never seen that many quail at one time it's a miracle and they know it it's a miracle but their attitude changes so quick and god says here i'm gonna lead you right down in here you're gonna you're gonna take the land it's flowing my milk and honey everything's gonna just be just like i said see we're no we don't trust god we don't trust him we we get so dissatisfied with something well that's all that preacher preaches on sometimes well maybe that's all you can you can digest at this time i mean in order to go hire you you must don't complain about what you've eaten say thank god for what i'm giving he'll give you something else but we get to complain with him so much so here they send out 12 spies down down into the land there it is my goodness can you imagine grapes as big as grapefruits coming back to eat them tasted them and two of them believed it two of them believed it brother brown said there was of another spirit if you look at that another spirit it means of another attitude they had a different attitude than they had the other 10. the other 10 came back and said wow yeah we got that but boy you can't you can't imagine these giants over here whoa my goodness there is no way we can take those guys no way we are and look at the attitude turn them into just what there was they become an insect they become a grasshopper looked in that word and god said they was going to give it to him he was going to live right and then all they all they can do is hop around now we're grasshoppers we're grasshoppers did you see that guy's arms did you see that spear and here two men have caught the attitude of god stand up on there and say we're more than able to take this thing look at the fruit he said what it was there's the honey there's the spoils there it is it's ours but brother brown said there was ten lion preachers they persuaded the people saying moses there's no way and they rejected the word of god and they wandered in the wilderness for 40 years and died wondered wondered their attitude was wondering we've been around this round he said i'll destroy them can you imagine that after seeing all those things how many times have we seen god do miracles in our church miracles on things after promises after promise after promise at the promise and i said well something comes up i don't know if god do anything about that why can't he why can't he has he lost his power has he stepped down and said satan take over i'm scared no he's not it's our attitude that keeps us from every divine promise of god it's our attitude and what we hear they heard we'll take the land ten 10 others said no way look at this it's impossible is anything too hard for god satan says there's no way you're going to make it through this code no way you're going to be able to do this we're doing it why because god said we would he promised in his word that we would do it i like this little parable it says who am i describing is the advance of man of our true selves its roots are inward but its fruit is outward it's our best friend or our worst enemy it's more honest and more consistent than our words it's an outward look based upon past experiences it's a thing that draws people to us or repels them it it's never content until it's expressed it's the librarian of our past it's the speaker of our present it is the prophet of our future what is it it's our attitude attitude your attitude determines where you're at with christ either you take him at his word or you don't take him at his word either you grumble and complain you look at the look at the anointing upon this age grum complaining white again they try to make racism and all this and we're all one we're all one we're for the human race it's not about they try to point us into that direction to give us a fight against our brothers and sisters and thank god it's not that christians don't look at it that way we don't look at race we look at christ see he tried to break that down to the woman at the well the samaritan she said you worship in jerusalem but us we worship here he said but there's a time coming when you're going to worship me in spirit and truth he broke the segregation between them he said i've come to save all we are one body many members he's the no hallelujah what is attitude and why is it important attitude defined as a person's prevailing tendency to respond favorably or unfaithfully to an object a person or a group or an event either positive or negative it's how we think about things or how we feel attitudes are formed by what we believe to be true things we look at the word and the word says what we are but we don't believe in i'm a failure i'm this i'm that the bible says you're a son and daughter your child is the king you're not what satan tells you brother and said i'm no longer the son of charles and ella branham i am the son of the living god why was that slave that come over here so special because he got treated better because they fed him better they did no they asked him why did he act that way because he knew he was he was still a king son no matter where he was at he knew his father was a king and he conducted himself like a king son that's our problem are we conducting ourselves like a king son or daughter with our circumstances her facial expressions give what my wife always said i can tell you didn't like that because the way you look i'm like oh i seen that she said your face will tell on you every time and it was somebody say something like i thought what you thought were you what was that look for well you know i have a problem with stupid you know when you do something like that i try to i said lord help me not to not to be so just smile say well god even winked at ignorance at one time you know but you know sometimes things happen in our facial expressions sometimes the preacher will be preaching and you look and he's somebody saw is going and then somebody's going man and you're like and everybody say i enjoyed it i said notify your face it doesn't look that way it doesn't look that way because it takes more energy to frown and it doesn't smile they say brother you smile all the time i say because i'm happy i'm happy i know what i deserved i deserved hell brother donny and he gave me a free pass do not go to jail he hit me he got me a get out of jail pass and you know your voice shows your attitude sometimes and somebody said something you oh my what what what what was that and said it's your voice i say god remember james said bridle the tongue the holy spirit sometimes we our mouth speaks for us you know the bible said the tongue is a ready rider and we'll get something to start and say oh my satan give me these diabetes he said oh thank you i appreciate you saying it i sure did you took them i give you this is my arthritis no it ain't it's his your blood pressure that's his your problem they're satans they're not yours you're sons and daughters of god they're not yours in our voice and they say did you like it yeah i liked it you did you you really didn't like it because your voice didn't your voice it tells on us remember the bible says how the abundant heart the mouth speaketh so we got to have a heart connection with god we got to watch how we speak and how we act and you know you're going down the road and somebody catch up maybe they cut you off just to see how you'd act bro brown said sometimes god sees how you react to an action i'm saying god help me help me because we're in the flesh and if we don't pray like we should we don't read like we should our attitude's bad you don't have to tell your wife you've not been praying or reading your bible she knows it she knows it and you know what if she ain't then come on whoa my goodness jump right i'm like whoa my goodness down whoa my goodness what have i done now i mean in the same way with us we shouldn't have treat one another that way you know if we disagree with someone we still ought to love them brett brown said we ought to be able to badly disagree with one another and still put your arm around him that's the attitude god desire he badly disagreed with him he hated his sin but he loved the sinner faith is having a positive attitude about what you can do and not worrying about what you can't do your destination is in god's hands i love that i'll have to say this this is one of my favorite things god set us on the gps god's power to save and you know your attitude when the little garmin i guess that's how you say a grommet or whatever that is and you put it in there you got those in there and first thing you got to do brother terrance you got to agree to follow the instructions that means no matter what you well i know i i was traveling one time with my wife and he said now you need to go down and get on 26 to go to buford i said 26 20 looks really good i'm going to florence anyway and so here i get on 20 and i'm three hours away from where i should have been it took me i took me three hours behind because i did not obey what the gps said but when you agree when you brother said total obedience to every word entitles you to the holy spirit you can't buy i love it though sometimes it'll say recalculating i've heard the holy spirit recalculating you're going the wrong way today you better get back over here well i just want to go over here a little bit you get back over here yes lord but it recalculates you in the holy spirit only a son and daughter of god will respond to that maybe i said there's many ways to heaven no there ain't there's many ways to hell but one way to heaven and that's through jesus christ i don't care what nobody says [Music] there's only one way one truth one life one one baptism one lord one faith it's one one one that's it but brown said it's a one-way highway there is no u-turns it's a one-way highway go ahead and turn around you'll fall off remember the woman said brother branham he had that dreams told her he she said sister you can't go with them high-heeled shoes up this way it won't happen she said oh yes it will i can do what i want jay she went on what did he hear she fell off into the fire because her attitude was not responding to the word of god go on they say you don't have to there ain't no prophet for this age go on bye-bye i'm walking right here because i know you know what i'm walking i'm walking in those bloody footprints and i'm watching them huh i don't see no bully footprints over there i don't see no bloody footprints over there i'm not following when is people gonna realize we're following christ but when you put that in there i agree then listen to the gps and you know what i am hearing the sound of the gps telling me now brother sam you reached your destination we're right here and people say oh no oh to get over there i need to go there oh go ahead go ahead go on there if you want to go that way that ain't what the lord said the bible says this way he said straight is the gate and there is the weight that leaves the right but brawl is the way that leads to destruction oh i'm just gonna go with the crowd go ahead and look where they're going watch where they're walking watch what it's producing this is the only mission that produces holiness they say i can do what i want to now [Applause] i'm glad i can't do what i want to because i don't want to if i done what i wanted to i would go to hell every one of us would because this man loves the world this man loves the things of the world but that emerald man says no you're not i'm saying oh god thank you jesus oh i'm so glad i can still hear your voice don't you do that you know what when i was out in the world and everything i got into worst trouble when i didn't listen to my mother and she she was my pastor remember she's the fifth gospel and i wasn't i was and she said don't you go there don't you do that tonight don't you go nowhere i feel funny and i think and i'd get into worse trouble and come back and hoping she'd pick me on the back brother sam and say well you know what she told me the way of a transgressor is hard son i'm like oh mom please help me she said you know better you know better we got to be stern with our children we tell them what's right and it's not if they don't do it it's not your fault but if you don't tell them it is your fault the bible said train up a child in the way it should go and it will not depart from them it will not depart from it didn't brother he did not depart from me i'd go do something he said you know better than that i think oh man that's just man what was that like oh my he said you know it better i thought oh god please have mercy on me you know it's cause we don't listen and then we can find ourselves marriage is wrecked church is wrecked people wreck because they don't listen to the gps they don't listen to christ he's got this already mapped out for us he's got the evacuation rap route down pat he knows the way he knows how to get there we've never been there he has people saying well god you know if you do it this way i believe it comes out better he's like go ahead then you're all messed up and you're like oh god please help me how'd that get in this mess he said cause you wanted it i mean i read a quote the other day brother brown said he said you know what he's talking about that he'd turn you over to a red bait mine and you'd be damned by he said god if you don't accept the truth god will make you believe it and then damn you for it what did he do with the that scripture look at michael when he come to tell the truth and those prophets was telling something else they had the scripture people say oh we'll take the bible they took the bible brother sam but they didn't listen to an ordained prophet they had 400 but there was liars because there was a spirit went down and said i'll be in their mouth and lie because ahab had to die he'd already been cursed for what he did to nabal but i said oh yeah you'll be accepting god i'm going accepted by them and rejected by god i'll take god and even look at the attitude to ahab he knew he spoke the truth to him he said give him to feed him the waters of sorrow and the blessing and when i come back i'll deal with you michael said if you come back at all god has not spoke to me and guess what he didn't come back and the children it was still disobeyed and the prophet i mean the attitude toward the word it's the attitude of what we hear we hear something i don't know why when you preach the truth brother said i see it mormon when you preach it's true strong and hard i've never seen so many people offended i'm not saying people hear but if it offends you what's wrong with why does the truth offend you you tell them what the prophet said what description you lined up with the scripture and what the prophecy in their offense i ain't the way i believe it maybe the way you believe it ain't right because if it don't line up with the word of god this is this is the road map this is the road map that's what brother bram did he didn't he didn't have some foreign book he was reading now though he read out the scriptures he come back to turn us back to the faith of the fathers oh we don't need you you don't need one go ahead you'll be no more than the denomination do what you want to do do it quickly you know what look at judas's attitude when he come up to christ he kissed him with a warm kiss but he had a cold heart he betrayed the son of man with a kiss many have betrayed jesus christ in this eye with a kiss they kissed the truth and turned from it you know how dangerous that is he said you'd been better off if you'd have never been born i said oh god don't let me be like that let me respond to you when you say go this way it may look rough but god you're going to help me i said god give me like david said give me heinz feet where i can walk on these hard rocks and these things to climb higher it's not an easy path what did danny henry prophesy he said because you have chosen my way it's a hard way what do we expect taking ice cream what do we think we're on a picnic we're in a battle why do you think he'll give you a shield why do you think he'll give you the breastplate why do you think he'll give you a sword and a helmet because it's a war hope people you notice that in the denominations and stuff and even sometimes people try to teach you it's going to be it's going to be easy i said it ain't easy it's tough a lot of people talk to talk but they can't walk the walk that's what james is saying don't just talk it do it and the only way you're going to do it is you've got to have the doer in you if the door's not in you you cannot live this message you cannot produce this message if you're not being born again forget it i tried to live it and found out ain't gonna happen so i i turned and said well i'm not gonna be a hypocrite but you know what that didn't change god's attitude toward me he said down the line that that boy is gonna come cause he's mine i'm not gonna lose one of them i don't care what he does but you know what i am amazed that people walk away with his met from the message and have attitude toward the message when i walked away i said it's truth i just can't live it i said i won't touch it but that's because i had a representation i said i can't live and i even get when god came to me that special day in my car a supernatural experience with god i was i said i never i'll never go to church again boy wasn't that a lie he said make every man's word a lie and here's the truth what do you do you're not gonna put me in church you put me behind the pulpit to preach the gospel i thought my lord no wonder i was running satan was trying to run me from the truth but i tried to give i tried to him i said lord i went too far there's no hope don't give up on your children you know what if you don't pray for your children and your loved ones and your husbands and your wives if you don't pray for them do you think satan is going to start praying oh yes lord help them please no i like what the lord told me he said if you don't pray for them who will we have not we have the opportunity to pray we have the token that we can't apply i told him i said i went too far lord but i love those words he spoke to me brother he said you never went far enough brother sam i said sign me up i'm going all the way seal me or kill me feel me or throw me away set me on fire god and guess what he did he did he did he set me on fire he said we'd be a consumer fire it's his fire burning in me i'm thankful for that don't make excuses to him just say lord i'm not where i want to be but god i know you'll get me where i need to be and i'm willing to do whatever you want it may hurt lord but lord i'm not going to complain do you know the problem with the israelites is their feet was pointed toward the promise but their heart was in egypt that's why they said we'd be better off if he left us in egypt wow think about that brother sam we're better off that whip you you forgot that you forgot killing your mama killing your brother you forgot that that's better than what you got now man i'd rather die in the desert i'd rather thirst to death than to be back under that at least i could live at least you could do what you could do but listen but think about that a lot of people's feet are pointed toward the promise but their hearts back in the world they want they're still they got frog religion they're looking like they're going but they're looking back we don't got nothing to look back to boy when jesus christ showed me hell when he that day he cut me and he showed me hill and i said oh god i don't want to get out and he showed me calvary i said i'll take calvary i take care and i'm not changing my mind no matter what satan does no matter what comes on me no matter what happens i've not changed my mind i'm not going back i'm not going to quit i'm like i said god either you give me strength to press on or i'll die right where i'm at i refuse to turn back i refuse to let go of the plow i said sometimes god you vulcanize my hands to the plow sometimes i stumble and it drags me but i said god let me get back up let me get back up and guess what he gives me grace to do it it's our attitude do you know our behavior or lack of it shows the way we perform in our tasks toward god oh i believe you don't read you don't study you don't pray you don't fellowship your brother sister i believe what do you believe i'm a question i asked them what do you believe you don't want to go to church you don't want to you don't want to do this you don't want to fellowship you don't want what do you believe when the bible says love one another and you run one another down and you talk about one another and you beat one another up that ain't what the bible says he said do good unto those that despitefully use you bless them and curse you let me tell you here this afternoon you can't do that unless he's in here because you know what we're still wanting an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth god had to come and change them because they liked that they loved that when they brung that woman and caught in the act their attitude was here stoner but where was the man where was the man it takes two where was the man it was probably that dirty old priest that brought her out there pushed her out there said here she is oh but he just his attitude was let's see how they can handle these words he said ye without sin cast the first stone we're always wanting to throw a stone but we don't all we need to realize we're not worthy to throw it when you want to stone your brother drop it drop it and stop it and say god i'm just as guilty as he is if it wasn't for the grace of god was it for your mercy wasn't for your powerful grace i'm just as guilty he said i'll change their attitude and from the eldest to the least they heard the rocks drop he said woman where is that accuses oh oh my that was like me satan brought me to him his amps and all his devil shot he's getting he's guilty kill him he said you thou sin that's the first stone they dropped the stones brothers and sisters and when he he raised his head and said richard where's your accusers i said lord i have done he said neither do i he said my blood washes you clean you are free if we don't preach the truth how will the people be free that's the commission preach the truth don't water it down don't sugarcoat it tell it like it is we're not hot bed plants everybody wants a preacher to spray sorry i don't have a spray bottle neither do i have a pacifier all i have is truth and to eat the truth you must have teeth eagles eat meat paul said i come to you look at attitudes that come to you that you should have been teachers but you're still on the milk my what a rebuke to them change your attitude change our attitude toward things it's not that satan wants to get at you it didn't happen nobody but me god's punishing me if you're sin repent if you ain't say god you found me worthy to go through this but i know that if you've allowed me to go through it you're going to take me through it oh glory be to god aren't you thankful for that it's the way we put ourselves into it you know the energy you put into what you believe shows whether you believe it or not i'm amazed that people don't even read the bible they don't read the message they don't listen to tapes they just take our word for it well god challenged me on that brother terence he said how do you know that man is telling you the truth if you don't read and you don't study you don't you think you can remember stuff no you can but i'm glad there's something on the inside because this thing is so close so close let's see the very elective it's possible your hats you said should be god keep me aware and awake to your promises oh hallelujah let me have the attitude to believe you even when it looks like there's no way it can happen knowing that god you'll make it happen i like what george mueller said he said god specializes in the impossibilities he said all things are possible to them that believe then why are we not seeing those things it has to be our attitude toward what we hear we'll say well that was for brother johnny but it wasn't for me it was for me too brother brown said if god ever done it for one person if you'll come the same way he's obligated to do it for you whoo boy i took to that i said lord whatever you know what i'm not jealous of people that's higher up to me a lot of people try to pull one another down i want i want to know what they did to get there how did they dedicate their life how did they pray what did they do to get there lord i want that i don't want their position i want to know how to get there i'm looking what'd he do how'd he do it how did he get there for that promise and brother sam i'm determined to get there by god's grace i'm going to do it in spite of myself several tell me you can't do it the inward man says you're more than able it's your mountain look at caleb even when he got old he never forgot the promise of god he said give me my mountain huh me and i have been around for a long time we're getting old things are happening but i'm still crying give me my mountain that's mine that promise is mine you promised it god you said it in your word that settles it you said it you're more than able to do it you think kobe just slowed god down not even he even caught him off guard he's like i'm allowing this for the people that really don't want to come now they have an excuse to stay home watch it on the stream i know some people are sick and you can't come but i mean when you get well why are you still home why are you still at home are we at the movie theater we popping popcorn we drinking drinks we doing all this and watching them is that the way we approach god is that the attitude what are we looking for what about when we when we can't come are we still praying for the pastor are we still praying for the church god move god i remember doing through that epidemic when i was at home brother teresa had a screen i was praying oh god i don't have to be in that church i am the church god i'm required i desire you to come to my church today i am the church of the living god this building is not the church you are i said come to my church and preach to me right here you know what i got it results i said oh god my wife would tell you he'd come down in there just like i was sitting there he walked by and touched me i said oh jesus i'm so thankful that you're still the faithful high priest that can be touched by the feeling of our affirmativeness so thankful for your grace and mercy do you know our attitude is the great determined determining process of our life you know how did you you know how did you do you know when john glenn was coming into the earth people thought he was they said made a mistake they said he said they told john get your attitude right they thought should have been attitude but there was three stations selling and they had to get them all in order to come down to that right one he had to have his attitude if he said well this one's stronger or that one's stronger but he had to have his attitude right he had to obey what he heard that's why they said get your attitude right if you want to get out of here you better get your attitude right i like a little parable said about a man uh grandpa he was always so grumpy and grumpy about everything fussed about grandma everything said his grandkid come brother sam and rub some of that old mustard that stinks i don't know limb burger cheese or whatever horrible smelling stuff it smells like rotten feet or whatever and said he was asleep and he woke up and he woke up with the attitude man this bedroom stinks walked in the living room man this living room stinks walks in the kitchen wife cooking man that food stinks walks out on the porch and man this whole world stinks you know what problem was he was the one that was standing sometimes we we point out everything else is taken but it's our stinking attitude it determines what we are and as christians our attitude toward one another brother brown said listen to this brother brown said improving his word before we pray for the sick we've got to get the people in that attitude i believe that's why we don't see as much more than we should he said it's the attitude that always brings the results my if you never hear nothing it's the attitude that brings the results job said don't you slay me yeah i trust you and the end result was greater than the beginning he got back everything he had and more if the rich young ruler would just give what he had he'd got back that and more he'd had eternal life plus you don't need a plus if you've got eternal life you've got it all he said it's the attitude you take towards god that brings the results improving his work he said it's your approach your the attitude is what it takes and what it what it is tonight dear friends it takes the attitude we are and we believe that we are in the presence of jesus christ we believe that right now don't we he said but it's your attitude that brings the results the mechanics is here the dynamics is here if you can just get started god will do the rest just say i believe it start walking brother brown said you want to get healed see a healed body and walk toward it get one foot in front of another that's what he promised to us brother sam he promised us that it's your attitude well god healed that one but i reckon he can't heal me no he can't with that kind blood brain said if you don't believe if jesus christ stood here he couldn't believe you he couldn't heal you because you don't believe him oh hallelujah harvest time he said and he said in his bible that he would judge the world by jesus christ and we read here that jesus christ is the word in in hebrews 13 8 says he's the same yesterday today and forever and said so therefore he will judge the church by their attitude toward christ who is the word well i don't believe that said be better we'll just baptize in the father son holder go ahead attitude those apostles they did what he said for them to do do you think they would go contrary to what he said after they received the holy ghost they baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ oh hallelujah ain't you thankful for the grace of god he said now i think that's all right if he said if a woman wants to dress and make themselves look decent and clean ladylike well i think there's nothing nothing to that to me he said but when you get to going to that thing into making it a little pride then you're wrong it's your attitude everybody look at me look how i dress look how nice i got look at the car i have look at the house i got what's that got to do with it what's that got to do with anything that don't mean nothing god god ain't temporal these are all temporal things it's good that we have nice things i don't regret i'm just glad i got the attitude if god's blessing you brother terrence praise god i want him to because you know what when he blesses terrence you're blessing me i'm part of that body see if we never get that we'd quit acting like we do we wouldn't be jealous who's the best preacher who's the most dynamic who's this who's that we just say god use us use us lord and don't if if if brother sam's preaching i want to be the best blocker for him brother aaron's preaching i want to be a blocker i love to block if you ever been around me and i ain't preaching i love it i tell you what i like hitting satan because he's paying attention to the preacher instead of me and boy i like to play dirty i like to take his knees out because he's running after the preacher and i will chop block him i told him there's no rules in this no rules in this and he would do you the same way we block see it's we all have the same desire is to get people to christ to make the rapture our attitude do you know your attitude determines whether you're going to the rapture or not if you are you in rapture attitude do you wake up looking for the coming of the lord he said he's only coming to those who are looking we say oh well you know maybe you come maybe he won't well you're going to be like the five foolish the five foolish what did the fight what was the problem with the five foolish they had the lamp profession a lot of people had the profession of this message but they never actually possessed it they had a professional brother sam but they didn't possess it they had to let profession but they didn't have the all possession see how key the holy spirit is we've got to have the holy ghost we've got to get it every day we've got to have a refill a refill when i come to church i said oh god run it over run it all the way down the saucer i don't mind licking on the table lord give me that oil because i know that oil is what's going to get me out of here let's stand where's your attitude what are your attitude toward this message what's your attitude towards your brother and sister what's your attitude towards people your attitude determines where you're at the promises are still there he said i'm the lord thy god that healeth thee and he never changed his attitude he said he that believeth on me shall be saved and he that believeth not is already condemned you don't have to condemn them they don't believe they're already condemned we don't have to fight this message did not come for us to fuss and fight over who's right and wrong i can tell you who's right jesus i like what brother brown said about attitude he said he'd come to that one preacher he said he had the truth but he had the wrong attitude the wrong spirit he said but i went to another man he didn't have the truth like we do but boy he had that he had the right attitude he said god can work with the right attitude he can cha if you got the right attitude god can work with you if you don't i'm right and everybody else is wrong i don't know about that i thought jesus was right and the rest of us was wrong and that's why he died because we was wrong while we were yet dead in sins and trespasses he died for us he come to change mind your attitude by giving us the holy spirit look at the attitude change in stephen when jesus was on the cross he said father forgive what they do stephen preached him a message they was happy until he told him what they was then they stoned him but he still didn't change his attitude he said father lay not this charge to him for they don't know what they do the same the holy ghost will produce the same attitude god did every head by ever i closed he'll say then this afternoon say god i need an attitude adjustment lord i need my attitude changed when i have my everyday walk i want the right attitude because i know if i've got the right attitude every divine promise will come to pass because you said it father lord jesus i pray father you'd minister to us lord as we come to an end to this service but never in the end to you lord but father i pray you to check us lord i'm asking you to examine from the pulpit to the back door lord if there's any kind of wrong attitude anything that's besetting us from running this race i pray right now you'll deliver us from our lord i pray lord you sweeten our tempers sweeten our attitudes may you fill us with your love lord that we can love one another and love our enemies god help us this day with this lord touch brother sam lord i believe you're doing the work with him lord i thank you for what you're already doing and i'm claiming what you're going to finish god you're going to finish what you started lord each and every one of us you're going to finish what you started god i'm thankful and i want to praise you for that before i leave this pulpit this afternoon god i want to thank you for what you're going to finish lord i'm a work in progress but thank you lord that i can hear your voice when i get out of line telling me to re-ejaculate get back in line oh god that's what your prophet said that voice some of the was straying back to the side but you used his voice screaming stay in line little bride stay in line follow the lord be diligent stay sincere stay humble god help us lord strengthen us i pray you touch everyone that's in need those that are out there listening sick oh god may you step right in there right now father may their attitude to be such a way that they'd give you such an invitation that you'd have to come lord and father we thank you for that lord that you're so mindful of us lord you give us everything we have needed with the holy spirit don't ever let us forget what you've done for us don't ever let us look in this bible and never look at ourselves as what satan tells us we are but let us look at what you say we are let us keep the attitude in what you told us we are that's what we will be because you said it and you will fulfill your word we ask it in jesus christ's name amen amen you love him amen how could you not love a god that'll supply all your needs according to his riches you know what a lot of times we're not we're not supposed to be moved by what we hear we're not a lot of times we're not supposed to be moved by what we feel we're not supposed to be moved by what we see we're supposed to be moved by what we believe if what you believe does not move you you need to have an attitude change god bless you amen hallelujah do you believe it then i believe it too i believe it because it's the word of god
