says a rattlesnake bit a sheep in the face a week ago the deadliest snake to Rome these areas the Sheep's face swollen and hurt terribly but the old rattlesnake didn't know the kind of blood that runs in a sheep the antidote for snakes is usually made with sheep blood the Sheep swollen for about two days but the blood of the Lamb destroyed the Serpent's Venom I was worried but the Sheep didn't care she kept eating she kept drinking and she kept walking because she knew she was fine don't worry about the serpent or his bite just make sure the Lamb's blood flows through your veins amen you believe that amen I want to make sure the Lamb's blood flows through my veins hallelujah hallelujah let's stand together this morning I said I appreciate the Lord appreciate brother Wade inviting us while he's away you know and he just said he's just right down the road not too far and amen so just pray for him and just you know the Lord to do something there maybe you know I don't know what he has to say or whatever but uh you know we as Believers we got a lot to say you know but it's know when to say it and when not to say it so I want to be always aware of that amen because sometimes we can say too much amen and so I just appreciate the Lord this morning how many appreciates the Lord amen you got a need this morning let's just by our heads Heavenly Father Lord Jesus as we come to you this morning we realize Lord that we're nothing Lord without you father but Lord with you we're everything Lord God and the scripture says we can do all things through Christ that strengthen us so father I'm so glad that I'm in you this morning Lord and you in me Father CU if it wasn't for that lord and there wouldn't be no use of being here this morning we might as well just close our Bibles and go

morning we love you and we appreciate you father when we leave this building we can say with in ourselves it was good for us to be here for we ask these things in the lovely name of Jesus Christ amen have your Bibles turn with me to the book of Isaiah the 64th chapter want to look at this little thought this morning by the grace of God Isaiah 64 and verse 6 and 7 say Amen when you got it amen Isaiah 64:6 but we are all as an unclean thing and all our righteousness are as filthy rags all of our righteousness is as filthy rags if you look run some reference on that it stinks in the sight of God all of our praying all our good works whatever we could do it stinks in the sight of God I want his righteousness say say our filthy rags and we all do Fade as a leaf and our iniquities like the wind have taken us away and there is none that calleth upon thy name that stirreth up himself to take hold of thee for thou has hid thy face from us and has consumed us because of our iniquities may the Lord add His blessings upon the reading of the word you may be seated to sworn amen I like to take for a little thought this morning try not to hold you too long it's 11:25 for clock Watchers so we'll try to try to hurry amen and just but we just want to take a little thought stir thyself stir thyself I was thinking about the scriptures Psalms 35:23 says stir up thyself and awake to my judgment even unto my cause my God and my Lord second Peter 1:13 says it like this yay I than it meet as long as I can in this Tabernacle to stir you up by putting you in remembrance by putting you in remembrance then again second Peter chter 3 and verse one says it like this this uh send this Second Epistle beloved I now write unto you in both which I stir up your pure mind by way of remembrance and that's what I want to do this morning as we stir ourselves and take on the scripture says there's none that stir theirself up and take hold upon God but I want to take hold upon God this morning I was talking with brother way to to yesterday at at uh uh I guess I don't know what it'd be lunch or whatever we had whatever so I was talking to him and I was telling him if you seen that clip where they the Arch Bishop of Catholic Church called Trump the the uh Constantine that he reminded him of Constantine if you remember in the scriptures how brother Brown brought that out in the church ages at Constantine how he brought church and state together brothers and sisters I'll just look and see what time are we living in where we at in this journey hey hey it ought to wake us up it ought cause us to stir ourselves but you know what it's sadly to say that it some things don't cause us to do anything but to set and and just staring whatever you remember uh there's a little boy that her her her mother just fell over the counter his mother just fell on the counter and started crying because all he did was stare they asked her in the store they ran to her side said what's the matter said well everything I put in front of him he just stares anything that would uh would maybe excite a boy of his age he just looks and and stares at it and the doctor says he's getting better but I don't see any change in them what about me and you it seems like sometimes we just look and stare and we don't ourselves I want to stir myself I want to awake to the fact that hey I could be me amen tomorrow be gone because here today gone tomorrow and I want to make sure that I got everything that I have to make it on the other side yes you believe that see we become we can become numb to these things even sitting in the Pew sometimes we become numb even singing in the choir sometimes we become numb even standing behind the pull pit sometimes we become numb to these things know brother randam said this message I'll be coming from that I read and how I got this thought I just begin to read it one day and begin to after I read it I go my and I listen to the TI and I said my message he preached 1962 called pursuing said this about the angels He said God so holy that 10 million sons look like black spots before him he said so holy that the angels look filthy in his sight can you imagine so holy that the angels look filthy in his sight and I thought my brother I thought my can you imagine if the angels look filthy and all they do is Holy Holy Holy what about me and you come on that wants me that makes me want to stir myself and make sure I I I'm born again not just on the the the not just not just something emotion on the out flashh on the outside not just something on the spirit but something on the inside the inside that I hold to that word of God said so holy that the angels look filthy the Angels before him are filthy I thought my let me read that again if I can if I may I'll be Amplified it says for we all become as one who is unclean ceremony like a leper and all our righteousness our best Deeds of righteous and Justice is like filthy rags are polluted garment we all fade like a leaf and our iniquities like the wind take us away for far from God's favor this morning I want God's favor I'm sure that's what you want this morning it's God's favor yes sir but it says our iniquities what is that knowing to do something and not doing it or knowing not to do something and still doing it said our iniquities like the wind is taking us away far from God's favor amen hurrying us toward destruction yes sir says in in verse S says' and no one calls on your name and awakens and bestirs himself to take and keep a hold of you for you have hidden your face from us and have delivered us into the consuming power of our iniquities so I thought my stir thyself and he Amplified and says no one says no one calls on your name name and awakens and bestes and I looked up that word best I liked it you know what it means it means rise to action if there ever was a time that me and you as the bride of Christ must arise to action it's now make an effort right hey I want to come to church I don't want to make an effort Hallelujah if it's if it's just it's simply just by raising my hands I want to make a effort my another thing it means get going and get moving if there was every time we need to get going it's now get to moving it's now and I like this last one get off one's backside I believe it's time to get off our backsides and start worshiping God start praising God start looking around and make sure our life matches the scripture amen this is God's mirror I want to make sure my life matches what God's word says hallelujah hallelujah my oh Hallelujah

brother you said Brother David my my bucket I got a bucket but it's got a hole in it then ask God to put a bottom in it then after he puts a bottom in it ask them to fill it up for you that's right Hallelujah is that what you want hallelujah oh he said looking over that Lake Michigan he said when it was calm and the winds you know he said he said what that wind blow in that water becomes choppy what's it do it just washes all the trash to the shore he said but when it's calm there's no more water in it uh in it when the wind's blowing as it is when it's calm amen there's no more water it

what he said that's what stirred Rebecca the message stirred her what about me and you this morning have we been stirred this morning the Bible says no one stir up their s to take a whole go help me to stir myself then this morning let what I hear not just because I'm preaching or brother way or whoever it is some of these brothers Lord but let me Lord whatever I see Lord let me check myself let

I'll turn 65 and August and he'll turn 65 in January but one day I'll just tell you a little story here amen just how good and everywhere he goes he tells this now I tell it sometimes everywhere I go and so he said and and so I I didn't know him from Adam I just came out at my house one day I was about I forget probably about 15 years old he's uh he's probably about 14 and I I I can't remember just right where you know where the same right around there and so I had a football in my hand cuz I used to live Brea and talk football but I came out there and I seen him walking down the street I said hey you and he looked at me and I said here catch I just stood he missed it and dropped it I said man you dummy I didn't know who he was hey hey he could have just jumped on me and beat me up but he I said hey you can't even catch can you and we just started talking started becoming good friends and I had a newspaper route and I got a job in the grocery store I gave him the newspaper route and when he got old enough to work in the grocery store I I I helped him get on there and we work together for a little bit and and I started witness to him and one time he come to church and sat down right beside me I didn't know he was coming to church that day he came in and his had hair down to here when one of the Elder sisters in our church thought my David's brought his girlfriend to church I mean that's how he look you know just you know be honest with you you know look like a well anyway anyway so I kept talking to him and you know and just something H and he he he'd come and he'd go and he'd leave and he said David I don't know all this nonsense what you're talking about you know and I don't I said well what would you he said I don't know I didn't Liv in Jesus's day so I don't know what he would do and so about five years went by but I kept witnessing to him at one time he he told me one time he said he wanted to tell me just to shut up and go on and I wanted to quit and quit said just leave him alone but something could I couldn't help it he couldn't help it himself and one day we was driving down the streets there where we lived at and he said David I got to get right with the Lord I said when you going to do it he hit his uh fist on the dashboard said I promise you David tomorrow I'll be at church I may not be at your church but I promise you I'll be at church somewhere he came to our church gave his life to the Lord hallelujah amen and now there he place to get TI of the church and sometimes he leads singing see testify tell others amen hallelujah that's how you water your camel amen tell them what has happened to you again he says as the eagle stir through Nest 1960 said it's Nest stirring time the Pentecostal church needs a nest stirring it needs an oldfashioned reval Bal like he spoke up of Jacob he was app of his eye he done wrong but he found him in the wilderness and he's like an eagle stirring her nest he carried Jacob on his wings he says amen the church has done wrong we've all done wrong but we're the apple of his eye he's ready to stir the nest tonight send the Holy Ghost in and Shake all the feathers out and have a Revival here in this Alama Valley that'll warn the nation he'll do it as an eagle stir up her nest and FLIR FLIR furth over her young and taketh them up on her wings and bears them up in the air he said so did he Jacob and the Lord's inheritance is his people amen that's it God's in inheritance is his people he told Moses said I'm your portion so I believe it's Nest stirring time this morning so let me just mention this to you sin you know what brother Braham said sin was unbelief but then my footnotes of my Bible it kind of broke it down so I'm just going to read it to you be all right said sin broke it down said what is sin transgression what's transgression an overstepping of the law how many many of us has transgressed and overstepping the law the Divine boundary between good and evil how means us transgress iniquity an act inherently wrong whether especially forbidden or not era a departure from right so how many of us has ever been in Era a departure from right missing the mark a failure to meet the Divine standard this is his Divine standard how many of us has missed the Mark I need a stirring I need to stir myself because there's been a lot of times that I missed the mark there's been a lot of times I've been in error by departing from what was right trespass the wrongful entering of self-will in Divine Authority the wrongful entering of self-will what self-will doing what one wants our own desire help me Lord cuz sometimes my own self-will gets in the way our own will has destroyed a lot of us our own will has destroyed a lot of moms and dads right right our own will has destroyed a lot of young people we want our own will instead of saying God help me you remember he had a will but in the garden he had to pray not my will but thy will be done God that's what I want remember when the disciples came to him and said Lord teach us how to pray he said our father I want him to be my father this morning our father and our father knowing that let him be Sovereign in our lives that God you can do with me what you want you're the Potter I'm the clay Lord he said pray like this Our Father which art in heaven Hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come thy will be done in earth yes as it is in heaven give us this day our daily bread lead us not into temptation thy will be done I want his will I don't want my will my will get me in trouble what about lawlessness a spiritual Anarchy another words absent of government hey God's got a law he's got a government you remember in the Bible in the Old Testament how they had a law how to tear the Tabernacle down how to set it up where every tribe should be and when they put when they had to pull it up and March how many feet they were supposed to walk behind it God has he still has a law but sometimes we don't want God's law help us Lord llness unbelief and insult of divine truth sin can only be Remedy by the sacrificial death of Christ what is sin it may be summarized as threefold number one an act of violation of our lack of obedience to the revealed word of God number two a state which actually means a condition because Paul said whatever state or whatever condition I find myself in I will praise the Lord I will give him glory whatever state and then and he said sin can be summarized as this a Act of violation of or lack of obedience to the revealed word of God number two a state absence of righteousness or number three a nature which is enity toward God your own nature your very nature is an enemy toward God I saying God let me bring my nature under the subjection of your word Lord amen but today so many of us have become complacent amen what is complacency a feeling of calm satisfaction with within our own abilities or situation that prevents you from trying harder God help us spiritual in other words I I printed it out spiritual stagnation you know if water sits long enough and you don't use water it becomes what it becomes stagnated what about me and you we either moving forward or backwards we can't stand still and we become complacent complacent in other words we feel like that hey we got a a feeling of a calm satisfaction because everything's going all right for us we got a good bank account we got a nice car we got a nice house so we got to come satisfaction we believe the message we pack the Bible we'll walk out to the pull pit just like he did say good evening friends we got become complacent we're satisfied where we're at and said it becomes where it prevents you and me from trying harder I don't want to become complacent if I need to try harder this morning God help me to try harder help me to seek your face more Lord whatever it cost me Lord let me do it father or we pick up the spirit of apoy which means lack of Interest help us Lord I'm going to lose interest and coming into the house of God if we have this morning Lord I'm praying God help me Lord let me stir myself once more Lord let me shake myself one more lack of Interest lack of enthusiasm we should be the most happiest people when we come to the house of God not only that but outside the house of God we should be the happiest people amen we should be the most joyous people amen praise you know joy and happy are two different words and it it it's it means two different things you would think happy and Joy would you know but happy means it comes from the word hap happen in other words in order for you to be happy something has to happen come on the your favorite preacher here this morning so you're happy that's good come on brother Wade shakes your hands after church so you're happy you get the way on the job you're happy but joy comes from a different Source amen it comes from the Creator himself and if the brother Wade don't shake your hand if your favorite preacher ain't here this morning you still got joy and the joy of the Lord is my strength hallelujah amen so I don't want that spirit I said God get it off of me Lord give me more enthusiasm give me more joy Lord David said restore to me the joy of the my salvation or thy salvation is his salvation lack of Interest lack of enthusiasm lack of concern seems like we ain't concerned no more us four no more we ain't concerned about the next guy but hey I'm concerned yes sir time's running out I want to be concerned about one another amen now brother Brandon read this scripture if you want to turn with me there numbers the 14th chapter I'll probably put it up on the screen I guess 14 and 41 I'll be coming from this message now the rest of my sermon and it's from uh and brother Brown preached this message pursuing this where I got this thought and there's he he took this message from this uh scripture here numbers 14 verses uh 41- 45 I want to read it to you I thought my what a what a lesson it is you know I thought God help us you know numbers 14 verse 41-45 and said and Moses said wherefore now do you transgress the Commandment of the Lord see they transgressed what did they do they stepped out got what did they do they got out of the boundary didn't they transgress was what it was an overstepping of the law they oversteep the law the Divine boundary between good and evil and Moses say said wherefore now do you transgress the Commandment of the Lord but you shall not Prosper here they was thaning that Hey listen we transgress we overstep the boundary but hey God's we got we're in the message we know the prophet we we we got the books we got the tapes come on that's how some we get that kind of don't just like they did we do yeah come on we over stamp it I said but you ain't going to prosper go not up for the Lord is not among you that you be not smitten before your enemies verse 43 for the malachit and the Canaanites are there before you and you shall fall by the sword because you're turned away from the Lord therefore the Lord will not be with you verse 44 but they presume to go up that's where he got that M presuming and what did he say presume meant to venture Ure with what without Authority right how many of us has ventured without Authority before God stir me let me stir myself this morning Lord let me make sure I'm not venturing without Authority Lord let me make sure I know what I'm talking about and I got what I'm talking about not just not just lip service but on the inside Hallelujah I remember brother Ben or or brother Bob seeing a film of Martin Luther years ago and he said it like this he said I got it here intellect and a lot of us has got it here well the O the youngest one of us probably can quote if they've been around the message long enough they can quote the message he said I got it here I got it here he could speak it real good he said but wait till it drops here God help me this morning I don't want it here just and knowledge and all that I don't want to hear just so I can maybe oh come up just get on the computer Amen brother and and and bring up some quotes and everything said hey I can preach now but I want it down here let it take that 18inch plunge from here to here God help me this morning Hallelujah stir let me stir myself Lord let me shake myself let me arouse to action let me get up of my backside but they presumed to go up into the hilltop nevertheless the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord and Moses departed not out the camp then the amalekites came down and the Canaanites which W in the H in that hill and smoked them and discomforted them until even until horor they got whipped they had to run back to their tents and stuff like a whipped puppy dog with a tail between its legs I need a stiring in my soul need a stirring in my heart no one stirs theirselves scripture says I don't want to presume just because I believe the message I want to know that I know that I know amen now brother Brandon said it like this in pursuing you might mind I just read these preach off these statements that he made it'd be all right 1962 said them uncircumcised Egyptians they thought we'll just pass right through the sea like they did and they lost their lives a can thought this little wedge it won't make any difference you remember the story Joshua said leave it it Alone brother BR said leave it alone we get a little old wedge wedge and you know it just starts out real but it gets wider sometimes start up real small but it gets wider yeah oh I miss church on Sunday then you said well I'll miss chunch on Wednesday then you said well you know nobody missed me that's just devil talk and then all a sudden you start missing again and again help us Lord aen thought this little r it won't make any difference the rest of the ladies are cutting their hair I'll do the same thing it won't make any difference but what he did but what did he do but what did it do it never brought pleasure to his family it brought death to every one of them I thought my Lord think about it because of what he did what aen did it brought death to his entire family hey I got grandkids I got a son I got a daughter that by my influence God help me to live right help me to do right yes sir help me to walk right help me to talk right my wife was talking coming up the road this morning I got sister-in-law brother-in-law looking into this I don't know hey only God knows I I don't know about some of you you you probably don't hey there's been preachers that went off messed up God forbid that any of us would do that this morning but there's been that way God help us yes but what I do we're influence my grandkids one would destroyed them it destroyed every one of Akin's family every one was brought out there in stone says and when we compromise on any commandment of God to please the people we kill the thing right there one little wedge one Babylonian garment start the marching Army brother one thing that we permit the church to do that's wrong one thing and we won't call out again and make the people straighten it up it'll stop the march of the Church they presume you're going on we may be in name we may be in numbers that ain't what counts that it what counts it's it's God With Us God in us God moving through us his word alive in us that's why I want to stir myself this morning to make sure it's God with me it's God in Me It's God moving through me it's God his Word Alive in me what about you Guinea says same message Church better be straightening up don't let us not presume this because we're bigger number than we used to be and we're more financially better than we used to be hey we are I remember when we first came in this message 1969 I remember I just a kid just nine years old I thought to myself me and brother Wade was talking here said here they sent me something to mail this past uh what was it a couple weeks ago time to get on Medicare man brother Wade was talking said man I never dreamed we to you know I thought when he first came in the message I thought hey my mom looked out there and she was arning some clothes in the din where we was living at brother Ryan and she said David I'll be surprised that you see your 12th birthday wow hey that's and and you know what we live that CL we thought God was going to come any minute but now we got LAX yeah and we just went through the motion sometimes and we presume that everything's going to be all right and we just presume that hey hey hey God ain't GNA come for no hey he may come for you tonight hey he may come for me we ain't promised to walk out these doors alive we ain't promised to make it home but hey I want to stir myself make sure it's god in me this morning so we better better got better buildings we used to have dressed better clothes than we used to have better cars than we used to have but oh brother I wonder about Christ how much is he with us see that's it we're just presuming yes sir the uncircumcised could not do it that's right they got drowned in the sea see they presume they could follow we just presume because hey we come to a message Church everything's going to be all right well it may not be all right let me stir myself you got to stir yourself you got to get to moving you got to get going yes sir or do you feel a calm satisfaction after you leave this building this morning will you leave a calm satisfaction say well made to church on Sunday guess that's it I'm all right but you may not be all right you may just be pursuing and you ain't really stirred yourself again he says you say if you're a Believer God vindicates it you don't have to presume anything it's God see you don't have to presume that's right the brass altar consumed the sacrifice if the sacrifice laid upon the Altar and it was not consumed God refused it y'all all know that y'all study see it's consuming and you are God's SA sacrifice hey we're all God's sacrifice the Bible says let us in in Romans what the 12th chapter let us become what a Living Sacrifice amen said you're God's sacrifice lay yourself upon the altar God help me this morning let me lay myself upon the altar God take it all out of me take everything out of me that's wrong Lord take everything out of me that's contrary to your word yes sir you're God sacrifice they up on say God just take it all out of me empty up so you can fill me up empty up so he can fill you up empty out of your ways and get his ways in you yes sir empty out that old rotten spirit that you got and get his spirit in you he said you confuse me he said that's right don't presume it believe it yes sir if you don't believe it God won't receive your sacrifice he could say John this is him yeah he's true I know it's him but he won't accept your SE God empty me up this morning empty me out of all my own desires Lord empty me out of everything that's not like you that's contrary to your word father again he says just don't presume I'm running all right wait for a Christian personal experience hey that's what I need I can't go on my dad's shirt tail my mom's coattail I got to have my own personal experience you got to have your own personal experience what did the prophet of God say in the in the message of Christ the my you he said what is the baptism of the Holy Ghost it's God made personal to you it's got to become personal to me oh brother Bob it's got to become personal to me it's got to become personal to you has it become that personal if it hasn't stir yourself this morning let it become personal to me so don't claim the Holy Ghost when you see yourself still Dilly dallying in the world hey I'm just reading a letter I'm just saying what he said you remember one time there was this guy that he didn't like to get no bills in the mail I mean he just get all over the postman hey I don't like to get bills in the mail either but they come to my house with my name on them they don't go to nobody else's house they come to mine and so he just get all mad he just go to fuss and fighting with the post postal delivery Postman so finally one day they got a new postman on the route and just so happened he had was had some bills in his hand to hand to that man handed him the bill and he started to get on the postman the postman said wait a minute read whose name's on the bill I'm just a postman see whose name's on the bill I'm just a postman this morning brother bram's just a spokesman just read whose name's on the bill he said if you're still de dallying in the world you ain't got no right to claim the baptism of the Holy Ghost Lord let me stir myself let me make sure I'm not D dallying in the world make sure Lord take all the world out of me Lord clean me up Lord yes sir Hallelujah Oh my he said don't do that don't you'd be better off to just forget about it see you say well brother R I got Shivers on me one day that might be all right too see well I danced in the spirit I might have spoke in with tongues I might have done these things that's fine yes sir that's all right but if that life hasn't straightened up you men still smoke cigarettes tell jokes take sociable drinks lie cheat not honest with your neighbor not even honest with your family see and claim they have the Holy Ghost don't you testify that no more brother we need to get going need to get off our backsides or Have We Become complacent got the spirit of apathy lack of Interest lack of concern one of these days we're going to have to stand before him I have to stand before God and give an account for what I let go in my house I have to stand before God and give an account for what I preach but we all going to have to stand before God as individuals can you imagine standing before there and say Hey listen I sent Brother David by I gave you brother Wade Brother Louie brother Bob just different ones brother Aaron different ones I gave you these brothers you still wouldn't listen I sent you a prophet it's my grace to you that sent you a prophet my grace to you to let you know that Pillar of Fire still in the church brother B said it was God's grace to Israel that sent him a prophet it's God's grace to Israel that they had a pillar fire leading them what about me and you are we going to walk over it guine he says he's talking about man and wife and loving one another and all that and said and if you don't truly love your wife better than any other woman in the world see yet there is something wrong if you don't love your husband you tri on him you don't live that right kind of life there's something wrong that's right she there will not be so in the you may have married him you live honorable to him that's fine I preach that that you should do that as a lady for your children your men to your wives that's right you should do that honorable but in the resurrection that are not be her what about me and you and the Lord he's our husband this morning do we love him more than anything this morning just think about it do you we live honorable to him or do we overstep his boundaries do we eror by departing from what's right do we miss the mark by failure to meet the Divine standard I want to say Lord I love you this morning I appreciate you Lord I appreciate you so much father Lord let your will be done in my life Lord don't you want his will whatever he wants you to be that's what I preaching a message I got it at the end of this message me and my wife was listening to a message one time it's called is your life worthy of the Gospel brother Brown said at the end of the message he said do you really he said let me ask you again do you really really love the Lord got a little thought brother BR my had a quote in there brother Bram said in that quote brother brm said they was in a in the country he'd been staying out in the country while he was there in some families house and they having a little bible study every morning around The Breakfast Table have a little bible study he said one morning we was having a little you know after we got through eating having a little bible study this one brother looked over at me and said you're an antichrist talking to brother Brown called him an antichrist you know what brother brenham's remark was what would men your remark was if somebody called me and you Antichrist What would want to do would we want to R back say hey I have you to know that you know what his response was well brother if that's what the Lord wants me to be then that's what I want to be Lord help me God if that's what you want me to be Lord he said it like this if I would go up there and he'd condemn me and kick me out in hell he said in hell I'll still love him God what about me and you this morning oh God help me to get up my backside Lord let me really let Lord let me Lord show you that I really love you by Living For You Hallelujah and not only that by living for others cuz that's look at eternal life in the face when I live for others not just talking about it but really meaning it again you're just same as Christ now you got to be connected part of Christ not something artificial put on I go to church and say the doxology and the Apostles Creed and so forth and I believe I'm running just as well as the rest of them brother you're pursuing don't you just take that for granted said you're walking on grounds you actually have no authority to claim the Holy Ghost you have no actual Authority he said not just a put on not just quoting Apostle Creed not just quoting hey quoting the message I want the message to be in me I I want it to live out of me y'all probably heard this before y'all been around a long time brother Billy Paul testified that he said my dad had enemies and my dad had friends but said you canot differ one from the other he treated them all just the same what about us oh we got an enemy you going to know we got an enemy we got en in the church you going to hear about it oh she did me wrong did you see the way he looked at me stir ourselves I remember them telling me you probably heard the story brother Brown they was at a when you go through a port there from I I forget where it was from from California to Arizona or somewhere around there that they always asked you said you got anything to declare playle like fresh fruit freshh nuts or anything like that well brother Browner didn't know Billy Paul somebody gave him some nuts or whatever he'd put them in the car and when they went through there brother Billy was asleep at the time well brother BR didn't know cuz brother bil didn't tell him he said no nothing so he went home I forget how far it was about four hours to where they was going to their destination they's unloading the car and brother Brown said where did these come from Brother B said well I put him in the car somebody he said well I told that man down there to Port that I didn't have none well we just a you know it'd be all right so we put on the but you know what the prophet did he got in the car drove four hours back and told him I said sir I'm sorry I didn't realize that was in there said I didn't mean to lie to you I just didn't know what about us I want to start myself he said you're walking actually on grounds that you don't have no Authority no rights again he says don't presume you have it watch your life and measure up and see what your life is see the way you're living see if you're in the faith search out and see if you everything is going just right see if the world still has God a love so much it'll call you away from things from the things is really of God to love the world if it is brother check up right here stop right here say Satan you take that dirty thing back I'll not receive it my guine says I like this may the church this is his prayer he said May the church return and whole may this be a time of searching in Phoenix I wonder this morning may the church return and whole may this be a time of searching in Lula yeah Spoken Word Church may this be a time of searching May the churches be stirred to Holiness and may there be such a moving to see that the great moves that you start up and the power of God begins to flow among the people and then worly and indifference and impersonations and carnal comparisons and wordiness creeps into the church just exactly like it was in our text tonight they did run well so they come out of Egypt under the the circumcision and in the blood of the lamb and they were doing fine but when they come up to another part of your word and then doubted it right there they stood and they lost the battle he said may we search ourselves I want to search myself this morning said they come out said and father we pray that that'll never happen to your
