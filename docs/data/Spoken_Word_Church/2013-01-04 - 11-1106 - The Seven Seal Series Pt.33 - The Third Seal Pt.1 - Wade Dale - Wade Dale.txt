them being here but just remember us to kind of get away do a little hunting so all right let's go third seal let's read chapter six excuse me verse five now let me just make a few comments the first seal on the second seal we took a kind of a long time we're gonna try to not take such a long time i don't know if somebody may be getting bored with it or what but you know we we i just want to try to get the highlights and the thoughts because when we finish the seals we're going to come back let's think about this the other day we're going to come back and we're going to go through the justification part the sanctification part the holy ghost part the the the grace the the love the um the many things that that that we're not really you know digging into we're just getting more the symbols we can start now because our foreign sisters are here i had a long way to travel maybe you should have not set your clock you'd have been here an hour ago yeah one come from trinidad and the other one from zimbabwe they really had to roll their car windows up tight when they got to the coast well they made it yeah and they both wore red so that group over there has been covered by the blood over there now but we covered the first seal on the second seal kind of fast we're going to cover the third seal with the cymbals and all these other things and then when we do that we are going to back up nobody's getting in nothing don't worry sister these other ones are they were like that but listen but we covered the first two seals kind of took a long time let's just don't take a long time on that on the third seal on through it's not that it's not important but i don't want you to lose our thought that it's not all uh white horse riders and red horse riders and you understand those are symbols symbols somewhere under that symbol is a meaning right john didn't get the meaning john john was just commissioned to write down what he what so not what he thought he wrote down what he saw it was for an end time bride to pick the thoughts up of god about that one horse rider red horse rider of dark horse rider all right but underneath that is the revelation that's what brother branham come to bring us the big nugget and then even inside that big nugget is little bitty nuggets that supposedly that we are supposed to in the end time i say supposedly we're supposed to see that they're open and we're supposed to explain it to the people best of our ability and then what does that do that opens your eyes up so that god can speak to you because this is an individual affair with god somebody me and brother uh soriano was speaking wednesday night out at the car and he said well brother he said the seals are open and he said somebody you know said well the seal wasn't open um i'm getting taller again so the seals were were not open somebody in the philippines he said oh brother i told them yes they are i said i looked at him i said you're right and he's right yeah i mean really you know you're not supposed to say but really it is open to the ones that get the revelation right because the ones that don't get to revelation it never opened it's still hunting broke if we don't have the revelation it's still not broke to us so brother brown could say salmon seal's not here yet salmon seal's not broken well guess what it wasn't to those people but it was to him right so he knew see this is what i believe the prophet knew he believed that if god showed it to him then he could show it to the people and somebody would catch it because he said it's not for you it's not for this generation in other words it wasn't for the people sitting in the congregation he said but right around the coming of the lord somebody pick up these things and sweep them onto the coming of the lord which that's what we're doing now i believe we're taking these things and and opening them up and and you know somebody sitting beside of you may not see them and somebody sitting inside of you may see them so to this person is closed so this person is open all right so when somebody say the seventh seal is not open you can say maybe not to you but it is to me if it's true that's true or you can confess like i confess lord if i can't see the seventh seal open let me open myself up up enough to see it yes all right now i just see the symbols i don't want to be like john i don't want to just write what i see no i want the revelation all right which was only supposed to come in the end time so this is the time that we're supposed to get these things all right no other time luther didn't sit see we're coming up in the age of man now we're luke and wesley they never they never caught the revelation of the seals it was just to them symbols symbols symbols people probed at it but no we're not probing at it now we have had those things given to us all right so the third seal here we go and when he had opened the third seal i heard the third beast say come and see and i beheld and lo a black horse and he that sat on him had a pair of balances in his hand and i heard a voice in the midst of the four beasts saying now look brother brown says that was the lamb you've not heard much from the anything from the lamb speaking when i watch from the midst of the four beasts in other words the lineups man and eagle god is going to make sure that something's going to happen all right now listen and heard a voice in the midst of the four beasts say a measure of wheat for a penny and three measures of barley for a penny and see thou hurt not the oil and the wine all right now what is wheat and what is barley sustaining life bread that's what you make bread out of wheat and barley that's what makes bread all right so it says a measure of wheat for a penny and three measures of barley for a penny and see thou hurt not the oil now what did the oil in the wine represent the holy spirit so what what are we dealing with here third seal let's go through some of the symbols i was given to this person sitting on a black horse the symbols were what pair of balances one wheat and barley was another and oil and wine was another so there's a few extra symbols here on this one but the black horse now remember he's not called death until the fourth pale but this is the beginning of death now every bit of its death but we're beginning to see that what came about in this time of the fifth and sixth church age which is the church age that this is covering parallel all right combat beast is man what we're now in the intelligence right justification sanctification baptism of the holy ghost we went from what lion ox man you can see a little further but the eagle can see further than all of them the line can only see past the grass the ox is a little bit taller and he can see a little further man stands upright and you can see a little bit further we've now come up into the intelligence of man but the intelligence of man took these not this took these and made that made a denomination lutheran wesley did not denominate they were the true seed of the ages right they didn't denominate you'll hear brother brown say luke are denominated not lutheran luther's people then you'll hear him say after luther's death the people come in and denominated lucas message all right but the reason that this is a wicked time is why the wicked one comes in and puts denominational ideas in people's head so we're going to deal with this as denomination we're going to deal with death a little bit i'm not going to write this one up till we get to a certain point but just keep these things in mind pair of balances wheat and barley all in wine denomination luther lutheran church wesley wesleyan church or what we call the methodists okay those were set up during this time of this rider going out of the black horse and i got that so we got our symbols kind of down we're going to kind of like say we're going to go through just a little bit quick more quick now let's go back to matthew we're just going to set a foundation today and then we'll go back to matthew matthew 24. matthew 24 verse 7 for the nation shall rise against nation remember we read this at the end last west sunday nations shall rise against nation look at that that can't be natural you know why look at the writing it's not nations there's never anybody you say well the civil war no the french helped us in the civil war the germans helped this one help there's not just one nation against one nation tell me show me anywhere that we've had a war a war less internally but even internally like the civil war the french helped us the italians helped the north the germans helped the north so it's not just see this would say nations it's not nations nation shall rise against nation so i believe it's talking more god's talking more spiritual because look at the next one kingdom against kingdom singular remember we said last sunday kingdom one satan against kingdom the second one god because satan and god remember brother brown said the greatest battle ever falls in your mind it's not with warfare that's right but it's god's kingdom and satan's kingdom and satan's kingdom trying to get in and god's kingdom either residing or trying to get in that's right in church that's exactly what it is nation shall rise against nato look up the word nation we'll look at that up a little bit later but just just for a key look up nation and kingdom and maybe it'll help you and there shall be famines famines what sure there's famines all over the world but the worst famine is the famine for the word of god all right and pestilences and earthquakes in divers places now we know this is a natural happening this is going to happen all right but the spiritual aspects but look all these are the beginning of sorrows all right now it's according which kingdom you're part of right you're part of god's kingdom you're going to have natural sorrow ups and downs ends are now but god's kingdom is a established kingdom satan's kingdom he don't even know what he's got he takes the world here and he'll take this because look power was given in other words it comes from a central location it was given to him to use remember brother branham said that satan really was a squatter memory has rights on the earth that's right because when god said i curse the ground satan moved right in because he's satan is a curse he moved right in in the garden and said hi okay i got this earth it's mine i was kicked out of heaven that's what he wanted first i was kicked out of heaven now he's now he's giving me the earth because if it's cursed it's mine so what did he curse he cursed the ball yeah but what comes out of the ball of earth me and you this right here satan had it dipped on moses body remember he disputed with michael they hid moses's body somewhere what the prophet said but satan was trying to find it because he said hey someone that's mine because he told the serpent he said thus shall you eat the rest of your life serpents don't eat dust natural he eats your dust because he told adam he said from dust thou came thus shalt thou return he told the serpent he said from this day forward you'll be eating dust so what you've been doing he's been eating our flesh that's why that we got to destroy that guy you say well i've never been a part of denomination any idea of this message apart from the truth is a denomination the highest form of denomination because you're deceived if a roman catholic church can deceive you you are ready to see if a baptist doctrine can deceive you you're already deceived if a methodist doctrine can deceive you you're already deceived you're not even in this kingdom that we're talking about okay that's why it's it's good to know that you're born again that god can talk to you sure he can talk to you before you're born again but boyfriend you're boring and he really can't talk to him and really it's hard but he will i mean he he promised he would he promised he'd send a comforter he promised he's sending somebody to tell us show you things to come that's what we're doing now because this is in the future really the natural happening natural happening is in the future all right we see that nation is rising against nation in the end time with the way the things are going the kingdom against kingdom but this third seal though watch it's talking about nations and kingdoms it's talking about what what's the first thing jesus preached the kingdom of heaven is at hand right right now the new birth because that's the kingdom of heaven the kingdom of heaven is the new birth right so you've got satan's kingdom and god's kingdom jesus was standing there trying to tell him hey i come to establish a kingdom remember that's what he told pilate that's right pilot said you come down and take over he said i was going to take over i already took over in other words and he was telling him he said but i know and that's why pilate let him go he wasn't a threat that's right you know if you brought somebody to me like brother mark to me and you know brother mark says well i'm gonna take over i'm gonna do like him four old guys up in the coal the other day you know they're gonna get a militia together and they're gonna they're gonna just destroy the world well if if i look at him and there's nobody with him and he said well my kingdom's not of this world i don't even have subjects if i had stuff decided they'd fight and he said but i'm not even i'm not in other words he told pilate he said don't worry i'm not here to take over your kingdom that's why pilate let him go because the peter stood up and said well bless god i'm going to take over your kingdom and i'm going to do this and i'm going to do that pilate would've had him killed right now but pilate said i find no fault in this man in other words he's no harm to me because what he was talking about a spiritual kingdom that's right that pilot didn't know anything else so if pilate didn't know anything of that that's right he just said turning blue he's no threat to me but the jews knew that man was doing something besides just being a person walking around there was a there was those two kingdoms fighting against each other all right because remember they fought in the beginning they fought in the middle of the bible and they fight in the end time right and who always loses satan always loses all right but all these are the beginning of sorrows now listen this seal this third seal is showing us just kind of slow down man this seal is showing us what the natural world's going to do because what happened was remember brother brown we'll read it next sunday morning today or a few sundays from now that there was a man on the horse and he had a pair of balances in other words he was weighing the gold in the world and the things of the world you understand because he start now charging and what happened during this time the catholic church from that dark ages they come out and what was luther protesting those 95 thesis boy's talking about it in the same school now those 95 theses were against what happened if you watched the movie martin luther before luther became filled with the holy ghost i would say and and started his message he was in the catholic church right he was doing the things of the catholic remember he would lay down across uh stones and say god he'd beat his head against the wall and say why is satan bombarding my mind because what he was taught by the catholic church was that if you'll pay so much penance if you'll get on your knees and walk up walk up a flight of stairs toward the virgin mary i'm just making a point or do something sister anna can probably tell you the things that they do but they actually tormented their own human flesh to try to do penance wheat and barley it started charging the people if you ever saw the movie the novenas is actually it's almost like a menu in a restaurant yeah that's what it is if you kill somebody right here's a line you know if you want steak and potatoes it cost you 2.99 or lord mercy 14 tonight all right i wish i hopefully wishful thinking i'm thinking about that murphy's statement you've never had it see you don't know what i'm talking about yep you know what i'm talking about i mean you never had it you don't know about me danny's had it and he knows what i'm talking about jim's had it she knows what i'm talking about sorry anyway but you got you know steak and potatoes 14.99 then you got sweet tea a dollar fifty cents and then you got if you want french fries with that you know you if you want a salad with that and well that's what a novena was it was something the catholic church made up to make money to make money so they took this sweet and barley which was the life life-sustaining food which was their doctrine they took that doctrine and started charging because it says right here says what a measure a measure of wheat for a penny and a measure of barley for a penny those novenas were actually that it was a piece of paper that the priest would come out in the community and he'd roll it down and he would say if you have committed murder pay so many that's why the catholic church is rich now people they got all the gold back then in the 1400s and 1300s and 1500s and 1600s they started charging people and the people had nothing to fight it with nothing well the catholic church must be the the one there's nothing else that's why luther come out protested that god finally revealed to him that the just shall live by faith not by a menu okay not by menu the just shall live by faith and you're gonna have problems and you're gonna have trials and troubles and satan's gonna bombard your mind because one time the movie shows luther in his room and he's like beating his head against the wall why he was talking he was saying satan get those thoughts i want you to get away from me get away from me get away from me well why didn't you have nothing to battle it with but see when he comes to the realization then you see him in the church he starts preaching the just shall live by faith he it just becomes so calm to him everything but see everybody around him though you still see the priest in the background they stand up in the in the middle of the street and they roll that scroll out and say okay if you've committed sin you'd pay 14 pence and you know if you committed this or if you committed adultery they got to where it was just like a menu you walked up and said hey i committed adultery yesterday well that'll be five dollars see that's why they charged for what should have been free wheat and barley is bread jesus said i'm the bread that come down out of heaven i believe luther caught that revelation i just believe he did that jesus was the bread jesus was the one that paid the price he paid for the wheat in the barley you know all the wine and everything but see the catholic church says no you we're interpreting this for you okay that's what they're saying we're interpreting this for you so this is what it means you pay us so much see that's where purgatory same thing with purgatory now i know a lot of you may not know this but purgatory is a place between like uh heaven hell and earth and somewhere in there that you go from earth you don't go to hell or you don't go to heaven you go to purgatory and guess what the priest goes well and i'm just making light of it because it's stupid i mean it's just it's a fault doctrine i wouldn't do this if it was real but it's like well he weighed 250 pounds so it's going to cost you a little bit more to get him out of purgatory than it would be somebody weighed 150 pounds because that was their mentality they did that with john kennedy on television when he was assassinated they preached him out of purgatory i remember the clip now i was a little boy but i remember later on in school we used to watch it and we could see where the priests were praying and doing their things and their and their fog and all that stuff what they were praying john kennedy out of purgatory and i'm sure the kennedys what a pair of balances they were weighing his sins against what they could do for him yeah and then paying him out of purgatory it balanced his sin so you know what that does that makes people say well it really doesn't matter what i do here see how they can see how that's how they do listen yeah you know why the mob are all catholics right but they want to they know they're going to go take a hit out on somebody they're going to go father forgive me forever seeing them listen i'm going to kill somebody tomorrow the priest goes well pay five dollars and you'll be okay or he'll say okay when you get to purgatory we'll pay you out or we'll make sure you get paid out if your boss has got enough money but you see how silly that is you we think that's silly and we laugh about it but to them people it was serious right it was real to those people they hung their soul that's why that blackness was the worst blackness that ever came on the face of the earth now let's take that over though and when these two became a denomination when it became luther luther lutheranism or lutheran doctrine or lupine church it was worse because it had went higher they'd done away with the novenas they had done away with all these things but they had come to a place and say well it doesn't matter what we do luther could smoke a pipe and drink a beer and he was all right so we can too but when wesley came along see and started preaching sanctification hey we need to quit doing those things well they denominated into a that's why the word methodist the word methodist come from the word method have you ever have you ever ever read or looked at a west um a methodist songbook you open the first few pages and it's all a method you do this you do this you sing this song you take up the offering you do this right here you sing this song why wesley in sanctification the part he was to preach said okay we got to clear our mind and he gave a clear order on how to do a song service and then how to do because charles was his brother he wrote songs so he was a good song leader so they got together but you know what god was happy with that you know what it done it took the people out of the pub took the people out of smoking took the people out of doing adulteries and committing you know cleaning the people up getting ready for what pentecost baptism of the holy ghost getting ready to clean the very inside person out completely all right but let's not get to that but see this now excuse me the wicked one didn't say oh i'm defeated he just went from catholicism to lutheranism from catholicism to wesleyanism for wesleyanism pentecostalism pentecostalism to branhamide-ism and all the other isms and schisms so satan is not he's defeated but he's got a final battle god's a good god he's going to give me one more shot all right but what's he doing now if he killed the people in that dark age remember we told there were so many millions 68 million protestants put to death by the catholic church on their record that many alone that they killed physically brother brown said remember i wrote like untold billions by their doctrine well see that doctrine carried right on over to lutheran wesley now listen when let me get this straight people on tape too when luther came out and preached the just shall live by faith and god revealed that to him and people become become converted out of that catholic church they're born again bride just like you are let me get there's no little holy ghost in big holy ghost right the problem with them was and god winked at their ignorance the prophet said but just like my story about the the the hole see i can point at sister mary and look with both eyes and and that's true i see her but see there's this whole room full of people but i don't know that because i just see mary kathy got marry on my mind kathy bless her heart she's smiling today she didn't get a two-week vacation though like he did honeymoon my kid brother ray did man that's unreal two weeks quit smiling he came out of that church yesterday he did but anyway all right look this is god i'll allow this because this is true this is the truth luther just shall live by faith but now god's got all these other things for people to see duck but now right now in the lutheran age i only see kathy but she's real the word of god you understand what i'm saying the word of god was there they just started putting the bible together in luther's time all right so they can start reading put scripture together all right but they could only see paul even says we should see through a glass darkly all right so luther saw through a glass darker he only saw one thing that joshua left my faith god said i agree with that that's the way it's supposed to be that's my man and those are my people that he brings in that's the new birth for the age but now that doesn't mean god's finished right because there's more of the picture wesley panned out and got oh i see three people sanctification we got to clean this place up we got to clean this man up but the holy ghost is still pleased to dwell wesley's people are going to be right there with us their bride they are sons and daughters of god just like we are all right i want that to be clear these people in the mentions don't believe that even though they were reformers even though they were reformers i say this is my quote they started restoration because the four life messengers bring it back four eat it down four bring it back right just in case the same case baptism holy ghost in the word luther wesley pentecost end time message okay so if four eat it down cankerworm palmer worm locust caterpillar if they afford it now ford's got to bring it back up all right so it was luther true wesley true pentecost was even true for their time but what did god do the lutheran people they stayed like this god moved on god said no no no there's this they said no no this is all so god moved away from that to more revelation then god moved away from wesley said this is it and it was for the day but the people said this is all we're going to do right here brother brown said they cabbage down set down on it god what god just kept moving because there was more to reveal same way with pentecost speaking in tongues bringing back the gifts see i've always said that this is my last comment lutheran wesley if it would have been luther wesley listen people god knows we're human he knows what our mental mind can accept and reject if he would have went from luther to wesley which was staunch you do it this way and then brother branham came on the scene think of the conflict but brother but see you had luther wesley pentecost gifts speaking in tongues healing the sick casting out devils having a shout in hallelujah time will see brother brown could come right in and just fit right in with that group and then you and i wouldn't have a problem but see with wesley it was more of a method way of doing things and brother brown wouldn't fit in there so god knew that he put that pentecostal revival in there to raise everybody up and then he brought a prophet on the scene so see they'll they'll accept prophets methodists don't no they don't even hardly accept john wesley right now remember brother branham's first experience with pentecostals he was talking about that lady sure and then he said he found he was tapping right he said then he found out he said after a while he said i was running right behind her so you know he he he went with god knows how that you and i can take things that's the same thing with these seals you said well maybe i didn't get all the one and two i didn't understand what you're talking about just hang on that's right just hang on to what you did that's what brother don again said last sunday please pray for him he just he's he's got his mind but not his body and that's worse than the opposite yeah i gotta lose my mind and have my body yeah you know at least somebody lead me around but uh yes i know but but anyway he said he said i'm at the end of my role that's what he said he said i'm at the end of my rope you know what i told him i said brother don i said when you're at the end of your rope i said time not hang on because god's fixing to do something remember the story about the guy that that come off the mountain he was repelling and he got down to the to the bottom and he was holding on and god kept selling say let go let go just let go and trust me let go it's dark god couldn't see anything and the next morning they found him dead froze on the rope and he was this far from the ground let go you let go yeah or do like the guy said if you get to the end of your rope try not hang on because god will be on the way all right just don't ever let go of that don't ever let go of anything that god's given you it's not immaterial to him nothing is immaterial sometimes he'll ask me some questions and i'll say oh tim you shouldn't know that or he asked me something and i'll get on to him but that's okay it's all right it's a learning experience right it's a learning experience for all of us just don't go backwards god never goes back he progressed from luther wesley pentecost to the end of the age and then we're going to progress on to the coming of the lord don't ever stop okay all right lord bless you keep that with you pray for us as we travel
