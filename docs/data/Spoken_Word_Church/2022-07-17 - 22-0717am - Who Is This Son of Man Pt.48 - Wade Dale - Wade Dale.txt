cause he lives all my fear is gone because i know he holds my future and life is worth the living just because he lives amen great blessing to know that the savior lived amen you know it's that's the

will walk in thy truth unite my heart to fear thy name i will praise you with all my heart and i will glorify thy name forevermore for greater than mercy towards me and thou has delivered my soul from the lord's hail but thou o lord are a god full of compassion and gracious longsuffering and plainiest in mercy and truth [Music] my strength unto thy servant and save the son of my handmaid show me a

go support the brothers and sisters in ohio but we're going to go up there to serve god amen not the devil we're going to you serve the devil at home we're going to serve god in the church amen in a church environment so let's uh bow our heads i think i got all the announcements out of the way if you have any questions oh if you have any questions about going see sister regina uh she's kind of gonna coordinate a little bit of that to keep it off of me and um we will um i think i gave oh for those of you that weren't here the meeting last week uh brother terrence has got some of the itinerary sheets if you need them if you're going so if anybody else wants to go we've got some more seats if you want to go if uh last minute uh we have no discount tickets somebody will get that one of these things but we're on part 48 of who is this son of man so let's bow our heads dear lord jesus thank you for this day you've given us thank you for the pride of jesus christ that's settled in lord and under this roof father to hear from you not to hear from a man not to not to hear a man's idea but to hear the word of the lord coming straight from the mind of god father we pray that you be with the ones that are sick there's some that's not here that seeks sister mary different ones lord we pray that you would bless them and be with them take care of the ones lord that are sin sick father lord the time is getting short we got to get out of here and we want to take them all with us so lord i pray that you'd quicken their heart lord prick them at their heart as it was on the day of pentecost and ask the question what shall we do to be saved repent and be baptized in the name of jesus christ that's what you do to receive the baptism of the holy ghost i know this we got to talk about what's going on between that but lord how simple is that believe on the lord jesus christ and thou shalt be saved you did not make it difficult it just comes from a decision that each one of us have to make well father i pray that we make the right decision this morning lord lord just be with the bride around the world be with the ones lord that are coming from foreign fields lord that will be with us in a couple of weeks we pray that you should bless them and give them travel and mercies keep the covet away so that we can have a good service here and at the camp meeting father just be with the ones lord that are sin-sick in the world father we know there are some out there that's still longing for you lord and we pray that we'll reach them that we'll show god as we talk about this morning those virtues is to show god not to show up you is to show god not show up our person the lord just bless this service and be with us in jesus name amen the bride said amen let me read you this quote from who hath believed our report listen to this right here some people touched the garment of jesus and was made whole others smacked him in the face and hid him in the head with sticks and spit in his face and never felt virtue at all it was their attitude of repro approach it depends on what attitude you come in if you come believing that you're coming to get help and you're confident that you're coming to the right person jesus christ and you're coming his provided way of approach you're going to receive something if you come reverently amen so that's what we come here for today we come here to receive something we didn't come here listen you didn't go back to the first grade you went to the second you went to the third you went to the fourth you went all the way into college and you learned every day it's a learning process same way with the bride of jesus christ every day is a learning process i hope you didn't come here just to hear a sermon i hope you come here to learn something god teach me something because this is his provided way look at all that brother rhymes in his divided way if you come to that approach you'll get something today so let's read the scriptures we've been reading for 48 times john 1 1 the word doesn't get old does it in the beginning was the word the word was with god and the word was god and the word was made flesh your flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth romans 12 2 says be not conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of god that you may prove not me you not the prophet you prophet's gone on he can only we can only hear his voice right but we have to manifest what he said listen if jesus if jesus didn't die on a cross and didn't resurrect we wouldn't have nothing to be here for and then if the prophet of god hadn't come to bring us out of those denominations into this message we'd have no we could be we'd just be home or you could just go to a baptist church and get you a good sermon on how to live right and or well maybe not always live right but um say that you're not perfect and all that stuff but we come to be perfected statue of a white perfect man for i say through the grace given unto me to every man that is among you not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think but to think soberly according as god hath dealt to every man the measure of faith so there's a measure of faith there's different kinds of faith and we'll talk about that a little bit more as we go along for us we have many members in one body and all members have not the same office not everybody can be preachers not everybody can be uh deacons not everybody can be different things but you've got your place in god if you're here today and you're born again you've got a place all right because what is adoption is placing it's not to make you a son by the new birth you become son but now we've got something to do i mean what would be if i know i got you standing but it keep you from sleeping brother dahlin back there now i knew him when he was a young kid now what if i see him now and he's still that same young kid there'd be something wrong but he's grown up he's got a family he's got responsibilities he owns a company he does this he's and that's his what that's the same way in christian life you want to grow in god so god can give you a gift can give you something because look having then gifts differing according to the grace not everybody can play the piano or we'd have 14 pianos up here on the stage no it's a diverse group of people and we have to put each one we have to get in our places right remember what the prophet said right when we get in our position having been gifts different according to the grace has given us whether prophecy let us prophesy according to the proportion or portion of faith you may be seeing the lord had his blessing to the reading of the word you love the lord so the first stage we've been talking about for a long time but i was talking to the lord this morning and i said lord i just keep going over and over and the quote comes back to the prophet said when you gonna get though the lady said brother ryan when you're gonna get job off by that sheep right remember he preached so many discernment every how many sermons he preached when you're gonna get in other words when the people understand why he got on that ice sheet we'll get him off of it so when everybody understands that the new birth is not this message somebody say amen this message enhances your new birth it teaches you to grow but the new birth was taught before there was even a bible jesus said ye must be born again 2 000 years ago this has been taught it's just been man says it's sprinkling man says it's pouring man says it's just saying hail mary's and and doing your penance and you see what i mean the the the world the men of the world as we read the other day they've got involved and their opinions have what jesus stood one day and said what you've done with the word of god has made it of no effect to the people because his word is effective it will not return void it will accomplish exactly what it said it would accomplish so if it if the word went out that you can get born again guess what there's somebody that can't get born again there's somebody that will receive that listen if we will all just forget and not have faith in the message of the hour where would we be where would you be most of us would be in the world flounding around all over the place that we might wander into a baptist church or might wander over into a methodist church our we got we got never mind we got denominations in this message just be careful where you go so the first stage is the birth we got to get the baby here we got to get because that baby has got to come into the world and get life wiggling muscles before in the womb then he's given life and we're going to discuss that a little bit later on sister freda had a question the other day we'll cover that subject on the seed so we'll cover that maybe a little bit later on but we got hey we got to get the statue of perfect man and if you're not born again you're not going to understand anyway that's why i'm hammering get born again get born again come to church read your bible do the things that god said i'll give you a promise if you do this and listen we're going to talk this afternoon we talk about faith this morning but we're going to have to talk about where james says that faith is dead without works but it's not all works brother branham thank god he come and preach works is faith expressed he put it all exactly the way it should be put man has argued said well paul said it's by grace james said this by works well they just tie right together i'll show you my faith by my works because you know i've got faith i've got faith i've got faith and set home and deny the word of god that what do you got faith in then it's not the word of god we've got to put our faith in the word of god romans 8 verse 14 first stage is the birth but the verse in three stages we've been talking about that for the last last six months i guess romans 8 14 for as many as are led by the spirit of god they are the sons of god for we have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear listen you were not born let me let me just give you this real quick you were not born with eternal life in your soul you were born a sinner you were born doomed and on your way to hell you were born contrary to god the bible says god will not dwell in an unclean vessel the bible tells us and even brother branham says look in the soul you either have faith or doubt either faith or doubt not both amen so if you've got this eternal something in your soul when you're born and you got the devil that's a two soul doctrine put in another book with another cover on it listen i believe you always were eternal in the mind of god because you do away with the whole plan why can't we just take simple salvation everybody in the message wants to just make us this great something we are great through god but other than that sorry rotten rascals born in sin shaping iniquity a spouse from my mother's womb a liar doomed and on our way to hell the prophet said he was on his way to hell now where did that eternal part come from only in god were you eternal always when you come out of your mama you were dead because that sees what's killing us now the seed word of god is what's alive and you weren't born with a word inside of you jesus was because he was the word come on people it's really simple but they complicate it so much preach sermons after sermon after sermon about all this come on if you don't take predestination i said oh i'm going to do this predestination you've got to take it by foreknowledge those he foreknew is first not if you take predestination they're doing the same thing in this message oh you always was so you had to come to this i'm going to pull you through it too brother brown said he's not going to pull you through a tube you have a free will to choose yes or no even cain had a free will oh but he was serpent seed no he was born from the real serpent amen we're serpent seed by birth prophet god said we were born between satan and eve that serpent so we were all born lost doomed i like that way you know why i like that way better because i can rejoice in my salvation i can rejoice that god justified me that he sanctified me and then he filled me the whole with the holy ghost where i was full of something else because remember you can't have two in your soul so if you were born in sin you got the devil there we've been reading where's that unclean spirit go out of your soul so you can't have clean and unclean you can't have fresh water in bitter water the scripture's totally clear they take the prophet to god and you know what they do i'm going to stand here and tell you today i'm going to stand just like jesus they have made by their traditions and their misquoting quotes they've made the message of the hour of non-effect to the people don't challenge me i'll take you upon your challenge for you have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear i feel free i were i was bound though i had fear i was in bondage but oh thank god he burnt that part out that unclean spirit went out of my soul and then god came in and did what burnt me you know what god can burn somebody and never even have a hint of smoke the three hebrew children the bible didn't just say they didn't get burnt the bible says their clothes didn't even smell like smoke that's how god can clean us up moses burning bush there's a burning bush burning burning bush that was not consumed you and i are that burning bush the holy fire god but it's not going to consume you it's going to change you it's going to change you it's going to burn you those burners are going to burn that old nature well when i get to it the renewing of your mind because see this is all contrary like i said before all these virtues even coming to church today is contrary to a lot of people oh hello somebody i'm just telling you folks i'm about the dumbest rock in the building and i got to come to church i got to renew bible didn't say that your mind was just totally clean right we're going to read it in a man it says by the renewing renewing of your mind being born again by the incorruptible word of god so i gotta come and get refreshed or renewed that's why i like wednesday night service too it's really intimate not so many people come i know some of you can't come that's okay but it's an intimate sitting some of the devils are not there and i'm talking about you not talking about you personally if you don't come on wednesday night okay he finished throwing but no there's demons follow you they come with you that's why you want to shut down i'm glad some people said it listen the older one said hey man the rest y'all was like i don't know where's that quote where brother said grief oh lord of mercy i was lost but now i'm found to me that's the whole thing and this message come to show me how to grow it showed me that there's more to god than just do's and don'ts there's more there's an enhancement there's something that gives us more my i was a i was really good in math but boy when i got into college wow what a step up i had to finally use my brain but it was refreshing when you know what you're doing listen when you have faith that's what we're talking about today when you have faith in what you're doing it raises you up another level that's why faith is the substance of things hoped for if we ever get there but you have received what the spirit of adoption so we in this end time have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry out by father and the spirit itself bearing witness with our spirit oh okay that we are the children of god and if children then air theirs of god and join heirs with christ if so be that we suffer with him that we may be glorified together thank you brother bob we're not gonna talk about i told him i said you quit preaching my sermons would you i'm gonna read some of the same scriptures he did if i get to them but that's god softening everybody up getting everybody in the right frame of mind getting everybody in the right furrow to when we start digging it's not so hard to dig hey man i love a garden but you know what if you bust that ground up to start with as hard as a rock and your rows are like this because you're bumping off all but boy when you kill that ground up four or five times you can lay a straight row so we pray to god that god will lay you a straight road today all right so justification there's only one way to get justified that's by god now why would you need justification if you always was eternal listen listen the destroy wall brother the ink the ink went into the clorox and it just disappeared but there was ink your sins that's what that ink was it was you your sins was put in the sea of god forgiveness your sins were put in the bleach so there is sin that's your ink that's you and when you were put in then praise god satan can't find you no more your sins have been annihilated oh praise god that's justification but we don't lose that we keep that every day god please forgive me for what i did not for what i'm going to do that's catholic sorry about that but it is you can't get forgiven for sins you haven't done yet so anyway you said well you're too technical one word off one word got him out of the garden brother brown said one word off will not get you to heaven i mean a change of the body it can get you to heaven but not his body change all right we're looking at a body change that's what i want i don't wanna buy and buy when i die i want to be changed i want everything to be right so sanctification is what it's in your soul and then the unclean spirit goes out what of your soul so there must be something unclean in there why are we trying to get away from the bible oh well i've got this quote quotes will kill you but the essence of the message if we don't get the essence of the message we're all going to die in our own traditions in our own i think this is what he said same way we like daniel 70 weeks i'm in my heavens it's as simple as it can be but boy it's confounded to a lot of people if you'll just read your bible you'll get it let that teacher talk to you not let somebody else tell you anyway number one he said he'd give you a new spirit why do you need a new spirit if you got eternal life in there i'm glad you're quiet because i know that it's prevalent in the message about all this eternal seed and all that stuff it was it was there for you but what is a seed a scene is the word of god not a seed i heard one preacher of the day said oh when god created the earth all the seeds were there so basically what he was saying was when we were brought into the world all the seeds were there people that's just drunk drawing at straws brother brown was talking about literal seeds of of beans and potatoes and and trees and and corn that's what he's talking about something without a soul you got a soul and that soul is either faith or doubt can't be both in there at the same time because why would he give you a new spirit even at sanctification we ain't at the holy ghost yet is everybody all right with this he said he give you a new spirit now that spirit is a gods i thought god was already there it's not it's waiting on you to make a choice i'm telling you one more time if if if we come to the throne of judgment and we're standing here in judgment and we don't have to be judged right if adolf hitler walks up to the judgment bar and he looks at us and god explains that these are my children the reason they're standing here and i put something in them special you know what adolf hitler's going to say you're not a just god you didn't give me a chance you treated them different than you treated me because you sealed them all the way away god is the most just god there ever has been or ever will be no he's going to say these people were born just like you adolph but i came to these people and they received me i came to you and he'll tell him exactly the date he came and you turned me down that's the difference between them and you not that i made these people so special but now that we're born again yeah amen we are special we don't have to go to the tribulation we don't have to go through the judgment why because we receive something i'll shout it from the housetop that doctrine is wrong it does away with all salvation why jesus have to die if we came here already eternal oh but it laid there dormant how can you have something eternal and it be dormant so jesus had eternal life the whole 30 years he walked and he was just dormant no no he saved the whole world with that i got to get off of that all right so look god gives you a new spirit then he says then he says why would he need to put his spirit inside of you if it's already there but the thing god has to do is give you a new spirit make your nature a little more gentle because your old adamic nature is still there dead black then he then he brings you a spirit to soften you up look make your nature a little more gentle and settle down or he couldn't even live with you i thought he's already living in there no he's not going to dwell in an unclean vessel and i know just free to send me that quote where brother ryan was talking about um eternal life is putting you what do you say it's the foundation of the world not at your birth so now let's go back to the mind of god then there we were not people brother brown what were we before we were born he said nothing only in the mind of god were you a seed or a word not a little germ seed the word of god is a seed go back to your bible does the bible say the word is the seed the sower son of man sowed seed not germs he was sowing the word of god and then you responded to that part of the word of god and god said that's my children i knew he would choose it if i put it in front of him because i saw him already choose it before the foundation of the world there's your answer i was lost folks what i did in my body and spirit and soul when i was a sinner god was not anywhere to be found now he was there now listen we're giving an angel i know i know the quotes that's what gets me is you know you you start um people start bringing out their doctrine and then you you kind of go against it or something and and they start you know what brother brown said daniel 70 weeks you know there's i said man i already read those i said my the reason that i think that the god has given us the revelation right is because i can take those quotes and these quotes and put them together but you by your doctrine has to deny them quotes you gotta deny the bible if you think you were born something special born in sin the whole bible's full of sinners by you know what brother bob said though look even backsliders you got a chance you just you backslid amen seeing you of what purified your souls what i thought it always was no it's a process purify your souls and obeying what the truth yes not a lie through the spirit under what unfeigned love of the brethren see that you love one another with a pure heart fervently that's why i'm so fervent about this i want us to be right i want us to grow up the statue of perfect man with no limitations i want the headstone to be shown with no limitations i don't want part of it i want it all because it didn't tell me right down here let me go back right here and it says right here and if children then heirs heirs of god and part joint heirs with christ that's not what it says it says joint heirs with christ whatever he gets we get he got a change of the body we're going to take a change of the body amen the difference in me and you and him he was born right we weren't being born again not of corruptible seed but of incorruptible by the word of god there's your seed which liveth and abideth forever romans 8 29 for when he those whom he did what for no he did predestinate or he did predestine that's what predestination means pre before you get started destination pre-destination but you got to go back to for knowledge before that because the bible didn't say for those who he for not for for those he predestinated he foreknew the bible says for whom he did for no amen he had knowledge beforehand he's god he knew what a god did you know we've got eight billion people on earth almost today he knows what everybody's thinking right now and the ones that are dead and gone on he knows where everyone is at every star that fell out of heaven he knew where it was when he when he created it so let's don't think we can get anything on him for whom he did for no he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the first born he had to be the firstborn son of man had to come in human flesh he was spirit god then he became the son of man right moreover whom he did predestinate then he also called why did he call him because he foreknew him everybody getting that you've been taught predestination by brother dale for 40 years the right way and whom he called then he justified yeah i'll give him clown clap too give god the praise whom he called then he also justified and whom he justified not you justifying yourself then he also glorified somebody read that scripture this morning romans 11 verse 2 says look god hath not cast away his people which he for you he can't cast him away because he knew your decision and he knew you wouldn't change that decision but he also knew he could give adolf hitler a million years to repent and he knew he could see down through time i'm going to give hitler 85 years to repent he knows he's not going to do it i'm going to give him 85 more he gave the world 120 years to repent to know his message and not one of them did except those eight but you know what god let him preach 120 years you know if i was god i just said well i already know what they're going to do i think i'll just go out here we're going to have a flood we're going to put them in the ark we're gone we're done i got a bride i'm going to save them i'm going to rapture them we're going to come back let's have a millennium no god's got a plan and inside that plan we'll get to it later on inside that plan there's salvation for others i mean this ain't us foreign no more god's going to save a group of people you and i are the bride then he's going to save the jews then he's going to save the church hello somebody then he's got a foolish virgin that's going to be given eternal life he's going to have health and he's going to give eternal life to he's going to give me eternal life a cup of water in my name so that's why the plan is so long god's so gracious to give us all time to repent and i promise you folks your time's about over like i said before this is a i could have a big glass of water up here but there is a bottom to it there's one day when god said that's enough you played all you gonna play i'm done it's time to go home because there's a group of people that knew where the bottom of the cup was that's you and me god hath not cast away his people which he for knew there's no way he can cast you away now that part of predestination i agree with because he foreknew you he knew you would fervently love him he knew you would do the little things ephesians 1 10 then in dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together in one all things in christ so this is not this is not my show and william branham's show and this one show it's god's show it's god amen god will not share glory with no one else so we ought to just give him the glory right now and forget about the rest of it if he wants to give me some gifts hallelujah i'll take them but he's the bridegroom we're the bride don't get him mixed up that's why the world's so mixed up they don't know what gender they are now well look at the churches don't you know that's where that spirit came from churches they don't give him no headship don't look at me like that freda when you get the furrow and you you know like that they don't give him headshit folks so they don't care what gender they are i mean look at the spirits these spirits just don't pop up out of hell the religious realm is what opens up spirits the two her thousand 000 demons they were locked in the river euphrates amen and brother brown said loose on the world that's not what he said loose on the bride to drive her back to the homeland that's a lot of demon but we shall overcome he gave us something to overcome with he gave us the true baptism of the holy ghost and when i say true that means in your soul you can have the baptism of the holy ghost on your spirit every day of your life and die and go to hell that's what the prophet said and i believe it i know that for a fact i can you can see it working in the people how the people have been under this message for 20 and 30 years and all of a sudden something clicks and they leave you can't leave this message and have the holy ghost you can't i'm sorry hold on that's wrong you can't leave this message and have the new birth you can have the holy ghost anointing on you every day of your life and die and go to hell preach like a lark i told you about that one preacher that i wat i watched the whole sermon he preached on the millennium and he did a good job i still got notes that i preached off of and he was sleeping with a 14 year old girl at the time he was preaching message believer so don't tell me see you can be anointed you have to watch that anointing why brother graham preaching oil ones at the end time anointed with the true holy ghost being predestinated look in him also we have obtained you got to go get it i read you the scripture last sunday the kingdom of god is taken by force this is not a picnic it's a battle you're gonna have scars but you're gonna be victorious and him also you have obtained an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of family worth all worketh all things after the council of his own will that we should be to the praise of his glory who first trusted in christ all right he comes first who first trusted in christ look in him also you also trusted after yes listen we're powerless without the holy ghost you shall receive power after that the holy ghost has come upon you you shall look after you heard the word what after you heard the seed you responded to that and god planted that inside of you the gospel of your salvation and him also look after that you believe so you got to hear it then you got to believe it that's what we're going to talk about a little bit later on you got to have faith in this you got to have faith that god can even save you that's a monumental faith because you know what there's 7 billion people in the world right now probably six and a half billion of them don't care don't have faith enough don't even believe in a god they believe in a buddha or they believe in a that a butterfly is god and you know your ancestors can come back and ants and and whatever and also you trusted after that you heard thank god you heard the word of truth if you're born again today you did somewhere receive the word of truth the gospel of your salvation in whom also after that you believed you were sealed with that holy spirit i promise why did i need a ceiling if i already had it because i didn't have it you didn't either is the earnest of our inheritance earnest down payment brother brown said little button right remember since holy ghost is like a little button it comes in you it grows which is the earnest of your inhere our inheritance until the redemption of the person's possession what is the person's possession this guy unto the praise of his glory john 14 verse 25 said these things have i spoken unto you being yet present with you but the comforter which is the holy ghost whom the father will send in my name he shall teach you of all things and bring all things to your remembrance whatsoever i have said unto you you know what satan wants to do now he wants to block your remembrance he wants to block the day that you got born again he wants to block the day that you went to virtual knowledge temperance because it's what if you don't have a mind renewal or the renewing of your mind your mind is going to take you back to that old dynamic part because now it's attached to your spirit realm because remember faith or doubt inside your soul which is the real you right faith or doubt one of the two i'll read it either today or tonight one of the two and you yield but what happens when you get born again satan's driven out you're sealed in so he can't get back in he tries to come back in with those unclean spirits right so what does he do he takes the second court the devil's persistent he's a lot more persistent than we are he comes to church when you don't and he's the one that keeps you from it well amen anyway so now he's working on your spirit realm where he's still again faith or doubt brother branham told the story about the old indian right in me now in other words after his conversion in me now i have two dogs that's not his soul be born again it's not the soul you've got to go to the outside realm memory reason conscious affection imagination your spirit realm so he says which one wins chief he said the one i feed the most in other words the one i let the one i let out from the inside is god but now sometimes the old devil is still on the outside because you know what he's persistent i walk back in i was comfortable weren't you comfortable oh lord he'll get you drunk make you feel comfortable until the next morning he'll peel you up and shoot you up make you feel real good till the next morning so you kids don't you do stuff like that you flee from that junk it will not give you anything but temporary enjoyment but there's a god that'll give you internal eternal enjoyment i'll promise you you just try him one time try my god one time i've tried i tried satan's god a long time try god one time one time lady man and he said unto them and it's not for you to know the times or the seasons which the father has put in his own name this is jesus speaking but you shall receive power after now watch the holy ghost i just read to you that was a comforter which god's going to send in my name why's he got to send him if he's already there see what i mean you can't feed me that junk i was lost i needed god i needed that burning of the holy ghost to come and give me power it says you shall receive power after that the holy ghost has come upon you and you shall be witnesses unto me that's why brother branham in a church age book he said the denominational churches are what cold formal and powerless because they don't have the new birth they just have maybe a good case of sanctification or maybe god saved me from my sins and god will save them but they're not born again they still got that old nature and they can't get away from it that's why they wear their pants and they'll curse every once in a while and say oops you know because they hadn't had the burner come in and burn that thing out what brother mom tell us he said the most ill-taught subject was what the seals daniel 70 weeks the most ill-taught thing is what the new birth the most ill-taught subject he said in the 60s was the new birth because they teach it as this they teach it as that you always was or you go shake a hand or you write your letter in the baptist church and make sure you got a letter of good standing and we if you never go to church again we'll still bury you under the baptist and we'll send you to heaven if you need to but you shall receive power after let the holy ghost that's why you can't receive listen you can have excuse me earthly virtue you can be virtuous never touched by a man never touched by a woman and still dying go to hell but you can't have the virtue of god in your soul working and die and go to hell that's where you let it out and let people draw from it and you shall be witness unto me in jerusalem judea samaria lula georgia that word we know is dunamis it's an inherent power power residing in a thing by virtue of its nature we had to have a nature change i like that last one moral power and excellence of soul so that means your soul wasn't excellent at one time because god's not going to dwell in an unclean vessel how in the world is he going to dwell in something that he cursed he cursed it uh okay in every age watch this every age is the age of the holy ghost for the true believer now brother i'm true believer everybody believe brother brown was a prophet am i preaching this some of you must not be in you there's another church over there you all need to go to it starts at 11 o'clock you better believe that god sent us a prophet to straighten this thing out and i say every age the evidence was the same those who had the spirit the teacher heard the word and that spirit in them took the word and taught it or revealed it to them today if you've got the holy ghost there's a teacher inside of you that's saying come on amen sick them this is the truth i want some more i want to grow but you had to hear it because you can't do away with ephesians he give apostles prophets pastors teachers and evangelists i didn't set this thing up he did all right if you got a problem talk to god about it took the word taught it revealed it to him look they were of the group that heard the message and messenger and his message and took it and lived it amen second peter 1 verse 5 simon peter servant apostle of jesus christ to them that what have obtained i thought we already had it now to me obtained is is i'm going to obtain that book i got to get it i didn't have it that's why i had to go obtain it right right that's some good left-handed handwriting there sister those left-handed people we tough but we good we have we're on our on the ones we use our right mind right amen thank you freddie that's right to them that what have obtained like precious faith with us through the righteousness of god and our savior jesus christ you know really i told we were sitting there this morning christian and crystal i usually get up about seven and i'll read some scripture and i'll watch some sermons i watched brother william borland this morning he preached last night brother ron spencer's he's gonna be preaching for us 28th so anyway something to look forward to he's

brother and and did a good job last night he's uh he's a wonderful kid and i've lost my thoughts so let's go but i'm saying to you that every idle word look watch every idle word that men shall speak they shall give an account thereof in the day of judgment you said brother we don't stand today at judgment we do stand a judgment it's not it's not whether eternal life or not but it's gifts position priest and kings we got a position but you've got to have something to rule over if you're a priest and a king for by thy words thou shalt be justified and by thy words thou shalt be condemned romans 10 verse 9 said if thou shalt what confess with thy mouth the lord jesus and believe in your heart what believe in your soul that god hath raised him from the dead thou shalt be saved look at this confession for with the heart believeth man believeth unto righteousness and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation that's what we'll talk about this afternoon because you got to have faith and then your works shows your faith amen because there's different degrees of faith and we'll look in just a minute confess to admit or declare one's self-guilty of what one is accused of sister freda did that the other day she came up here and she said i'm sorry for what some whatever i said and then you know i did the same thing with a minister friend of mine that i said something against him and i called him and apologized boy did you talk about making you feel good it's all bro wait that made me feel bad no i felt bad cause i didn't you should as a christian feel bad if you do something to somebody and and and god help us i know sometimes we do it and and don't realize it but lord bring it to our attention right bringing to our attention that we need to get that thing out she had to do it again yesterday see it's a daily thing with some of us the left-handed group i guess is in our right mind yes maybe we have the right right mind confess your faults one to another we're a family we're a family oh i'll get back to my thought now christian and crystal why didn't you bring you knew what i was gonna say i usually get up at seven o'clock read my bible you know and i was watching william that's where i was going thank you they get up at seven o'clock ready to go to church fully dressed just like you are now and i'm sitting there in my jammies good ones and my t-shirt and i'm getting ready to sit down and have my coffee and my quiet time virginia you know what i'm talking about i sit in my chair don't leave me alone i'm in my bubble for at least for a little while so i get woke up you know people said don't wake up grumpy no i just let her sleep wherever she is where'd you jim where you at who are you at downstairs okay all right so here they are they get ready and they're they're just they're just like they are now at seven o'clock and here's christian i'm ready and i'm going one moment please so i'll go out and do something else i'll walk by camera jean and i said i think me and junior go to church today we've decided we've decided we're going to go to church but we'll be there a long time after y'all y'all going we'll be in a little while but look at that they were up and ready the charge had already been lit the fire had already been burning and they wanted to go i told them i said you get older you'll quit that business i'm confessing my faults one to the other and pray for one another that you may be healed official fervent prayer of a righteous man of alist much a prayer life is that where we're losing it at yeah but that's where we can gain it no money no price you don't have to buy rosary beads or a cross pray that's why god gave it equal to everybody you got money in your pocket you still need to pray if you don't have money in your pocket you need to pray the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man obeys much all right the word possess means to acquire to get or procure a thing for oneself to possess to marry your wife second that first thessalonians 4 4 said every one of you should know how to possess his vessel in sanctification and honor and i wrote stature that's where that scripture right there to me triggers what we have to do every one of you should know how to possess is this not your vessel that's your vessel and you got to know how to possess your vessel because you know what if not you're possessed of one or two things you're possessed of the devil or you possess the god so there's your confession is your pro possession because look to acquire get or procure for oneself you know who's your worst enemy regina oh frederick well you repent okay hurry no you i am i'm my worst enemy and you know what if i believe that and see that then god can work on me but if i say no brother darty if he get all straightened up that'll work does he brothers already nope he's been in the message a long time i haven't helped at all has it to try to get me straightened out no try to get yourself straightened out we're on worst enemy why because our confession there was a lot of confessions outside during the baptismal service god's going to hold you to that confession because if you don't confess you won't possess you'll be possessed all right where's a lot of people in this world that's possessing the devil but you know what they let him in i'm my own worst enemy so i let him in every one of you should know how to possess your vessel in sanctification and honor let's read this statue of a perfect man what is sin unbelief now here's a quote i was going to get to there's only two elements that control the human being two that's either doubt or faith one or the other you're possessed of one that dominates your life just depends on how much faith you have is how high you can rise you're possessed of one that dominates your life which one wins when i feed the most manifestation of the spirit 1951 toledo ohio up there close to where you all live now you come to the altar realize you're a sinner and you're sorry for your sins now watch this you repent of what you've done and you can stay there and cry for a week in a week out and it would never save you until you believe in your heart that you are saved is that right then you confess it that's right now he can't do nothing for you until you confess it is that right for he is the high priest of what of your confession he can do nothing look how we bind god we bind the word of god you confess me before men i'll confess you before the father is that right what you say i've done down here for you that's what i say the father in other words you come down and died for us that i've done for you he's the high priest you get that young man he's talking to some young man yo man young man y'all get that the high priest of your confession now here he is sitting here to make intercession on your confession not just that you're going to make an idle confession but when you confess there's an intercessor standing there going i'll take that i'll take that he's confessed but you know what listen in a court of law i'll get my notes out here in a court of law hearsay is not evidence hearsay is not evidence inadmissible in the court of law cause this one said that that one said that that one said right but what is a testimony you come to the judge or come to the jury or you come to the courtroom and you what you testify about what you saw not what you thought you saw that's a testimony same way in your christian life how are you going to be convicted of being a christian if you don't act like one would there be enough evidence if god took us to court and said you decide whether they're christian or not look at their life look at their testimony their testimony listen a testimony is only what's admitted as evidence here says not secondhand information is not but a testimony is admissible in a court so god can only be your intercessor if you don't have a testimony and it's got to happen to you not somebody else it's your testimony that's well withheld or held up in a court the prophet of god said in the 70th week of daniel i said i'll imagine when it's sifted they'll watch this they asked somebody asked asking said somebody said brother why are you so hard on the people it looks like you're kind of in other words you know you preach and this one leaves and you're preaching this belief or you preach against the baptist or you're preaching against the methods you're preaching against something when you get the real pure in heart born again of the spirit remember this was the only church age that christ was put out of his own church of all of them you've got a great confession but do you have a possession it's what we're talking about is christ really in the church it'll be very much in the minority simon peter servant apostle jesus christ i read that but we're going to continue reading the scripture to them that what have obtained like precious faith with us through the righteousness of god and our savior jesus christ let me ask you a question real quick peter and them were with jesus after he after he came back everybody with me here just for a second we'll preach on this a little bit later but here jesus comes back glorified everybody with me he said look go to jerusalem i read the scripture a couple weeks ago until you be what endued with power from on high and then the bible says he breathed on them and said receive you the holy ghost now why didn't they get it right then hmm wheels are turning why didn't they get it i'll correct i'll read you the bible i wasn't going to go this way but we're going this way read your bible after jesus glorification he's standing there in a glorified body he's telling them to go to jerusalem to wait and be endured with enude with power from on high and he's in the upper or wherever he's at right before his ascension and he breathes on them the bible says and says receive you the holy ghost now buddy right then would have been when that seed or whatever they were supposed to have we just went hello somebody but that wasn't the way it was he was the seed and brother branham thank god for a prophet he said potentially in other words it puts you in line to get it listen we don't go get in line from mcdonald's to get a burger king hamburger you get in the right line brother dale's always said don't buy a bus ticket go the airport and expect to go somewhere you gotta get the right ticket to the right place i believe we're trying now to get the right take you to the right place get in line but why didn't they receive it then because it was all still in jesus cause he prophesied go to jerusalem and wait until you be endued with power from on high so now let's go 11 days to the upper room that promise became vindicated because 120 little jesus were born again and they received the holy ghost amen look at paul all these different look at the apostle paul now when god struck him down on the river i mean on damascus road right now remember paul was going to be a prophet church age messenger he was going to write 80 of the bible but look he ever thought about just think simple with me just for a second thank god for a prophet if i ever said that before thank god for a promise because he said bride don't persecute bride amen you know what he said bride don't persecute bride what did paul do i'm gonna sit down a minute let you think about that what'd paul do before his conversion what did paul do persecuted bride caused them to blaspheme and go to their death but paul had this seed in him really then he shouldn't have been persecuting bride because bride can't persecute brian no paul was lost paul did not have the holy ghost paul did not have a seed planted inside of him now he had a seed before the foundation of the world in the mind of god waiting on a day when paul would come to a crossroad god would strike him off of a horse and oh he should have got it there buddy that thing should have went pow oh yeah i got it and paul's over going no you know what god struck him blind and he goes over to the seed body that's already got the new birth a nice and said a nice i'm going to send you somebody who lord saul oh no lord i know you don't make mistakes lord but could you reconsider that maybe send him to somebody else maybe my neighbor bob said no brother bob bro bob take care of him god said no i got a purpose for this man but my only the only life he's going to get is going to come through the body and anas had to lay hands on him and the scales fell off of his eyes and he became what paul the church age messenger paul the born-again believer paul the preacher that put 80 of that bible together there's where paul came to his quickening but he had to receive it grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of god in jesus our lord according what as his divine power has given unto us all things now did you have that divine power before no you didn't you had a power all right it was a devil power to all things that pertain to life and godliness through the knowledge of him that hath called us the glory and virtue whereby our given unto us what exceeding great impression somebody say that with me exceeding great and precious promises that by these promises you might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped hallelujah escaped because you were bound you were in prison you were headed for hell you were headed for death you were headed for annihilation from god that's what i can praise god for he took me out of that because he stole my choice not that i'm scared to go to hell no i was going but having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust oh that sounds like great we just go home now pretty well you're looking at now and besides this you can't hide your feelings and besides this giving look and besides this oh it's great we got it we got this big old wide faith down here we we're gonna let it renew our mind and face is the substance and we live by faith and god give us all these promises and besides this peter knew his birth birthed him but he knew he had to have work done he had to have the master sculptor still cut away from paul peter james john charlotte brother collie from brother amen that by these you might be partakers of the divine nature having shaped the corruption that is in the world too lust and beside this that's what we're going to talk about and besides this giving all diligence i had to now it has become something different it's become your face amen it's your faith when you receive the new birth thank god for a prophet everybody believe god sent a prophet right okay brother brown said this is my eye god gave it to me all right this is my new birth god gave it to me so now this is my faith because that's what i live by i live by faith i'd hate to be faithless but even the world believes in something but you know what they'll believe in something over here and then this one will fall then they'll jump over here and say well i think we're believing this one over here well oh well he's just human so i just believe in this one over here oh lordy now faith is the substance of things hoped for look the renewing of our mind the evidence of things not saying we'll cover this real quick and then we'll then we'll close this afternoon for by the elders what obtain a good report faith and works all right through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of god so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear but by faith abel offered unto god a more excellent sacrifice than cain and now there's a doctrine in the message that abel was righteous from his birth see they always they go back to why do you need a sacrifice why did we need a sacrifice if abel didn't need a sacrifice if he was righteous from birth what he needed for that sacrifice is laying there for your sins my sins we've just become a bunch of religious sinners sorry about that if it hurt should have by faith and visitors sorry i don't usually preach like this by faith abel offered unto god a more excellent sacrifice than cain by which he what obtained why is that word obtained keeps coming up you could have get something able had to take that sacrifice lay it on a rock take a rock and and blood just going everywhere you hit something in the jugular vein you all know you've seen animals die man it's just like it's not pretty but you know what god's sacrifice on calvary wasn't pretty either but it was the prettiest thing i ever seen in my life it was the absolute prettiest thing i've ever seen in my life which he obtained witness that he was righteous he obtained a witness he was righteous he didn't born righteous god testifying of his gifts and by it being dead yet speaketh by faith enoch was translated that he should not see death and was not found because god had translated him for what before his translation he had this what testimony he was in the court with a testimony that he pleased god and then that judge said okay you please me the attorney says you please me and then lord you look over and he's the jury too but without faith it is impossible to please him for he that cometh to god must believe that he is what he is god and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him let's read this right here and then we'll stop we'll continue this right here this afternoon we won't do a lot of background this afternoon now we want to speak now upon faith and a different type of faith so there must be different types of faith all right we proved that the other day we just kind of backed up a little bit here that's a great thing now faith we're told in the bible faith cometh by hearing now you cannot be saved without faith and faith is something that you have to believe it's there that really nothing else will declare it's there but faith now i'm trying to bring faith to you so that you can be ready for this prayer line in a few minutes now faith he that cometh to god must believe that he is and it's impossible to please god without faith you cannot please him and if you say you believe god you've never seen him so then you've got to believe it by faith and if you could see him it wouldn't be faith we're going not we're not going to need faith in jesus christ when we get a glorified body and we're in the millennium he's going to be right there with us when you receive your healing you don't need faith for that same healing again if it goes away like it's supposed to now we know it can come back so but watch this right here talk about moses just for a second magicians get ready to come this is the burning bush experience which brother brown said everybody needs a burning boost experience here i am in the bush burning go down there i'll be with you he didn't need a stick he had the word the vindicated word there he went it anointed the faith that was in him oh it anoints our faith it moves us out in great cycles it separates us from other things of the world no matter how little we are or how much a minority we are how much we've laughed been laughed at made fun of don't make a bit of difference that's all we just see it there is something within us we were predestinated to see this hour why by foreign knowledge amen here god has spoken it's already happened we see it oh how we thank god for this and then it brings out your faith when you see these things happening here listen it ought to make your faith stronger as prophecy is being fulfilled not weaker because that's the spirit of fear the spirit of fear makes you fearful of all these prophecies that are coming to pass be not conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind that you may prove that you may prove listen we are the only people that's going to prove this message is right the only people that's going to prove this message is right that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of god for i say through the grace given unto me to every man that is among you not to be think of yourself more highly than he ought to but to think soberly according what god had dealt to you the measure of faith we talked about measure but also renewing is what renovation complete change for the better and i wrote myself a note because the virtues are contrary to god no the virtues are contrary to you i wrote that so some of you say man i treat you no the virtues are contrary to you you see virtues displayed out there one more time no the only verse the only time you're going to see true virtue is right here in the bride you draw strength from the bride you draw strength from talking fellowshipping doing the things of god but you were born contrary to god amen that's why i said about the new birth but these virtues are contrary to you look watch this brother and say look have faith and be born again that's laying the foundation jude 1 verse 3. let's read this and then musicians come on beloved when i give all diligence to write unto you the common salvation it was needful for me to write unto you and exhort you that you should what earnestly contend for the faith which was once delivered unto the saints for there are certain men crypt and underwears white false teachers who were before of old ordained to this condemnation ungodly men god by foreknowledge knew they would be here turning the grace of our god into lasciviousness and denying the only lord god in our lord jesus christ so there must be something because it says look earnestly contend for the faith that was once delivered so there was a faith that was lost and this afternoon we'll explain we we we make the quote or we make the saying faith of the fathers and maybe you don't know what that is but i'm gonna explain it this afternoon we'll start right there with the faith of the fathers let's stand but that was lost that faith was lost back in the church ages that faith was lost because man said oh i think he's three oh i don't think he's the substance of god he's a lock substance of god oh i don't think we need to baptize in the way peter said we're going to baptize the way the lord said right they got all these ideas so we had to have somebody come back and elijah as we're going to read this afternoon and elijah come back and restore that faith back to have what faith in the word of god not faith in man's ideas or a catechism or or apostle's creed those catholics believe in those rosary beads man they get in trouble they'll pull them things out and they'll start holy mother of god and you know saints of this and saints of that took god completely out of it don't even pray to jesus wouldn't did god do that no mr devil did that to what to not do away with the word of god but to make it of none effect to the believers amen let's sing a song god bless you [Music] with love [Music] [Laughter] lose all their guilty [Music] [Applause] lose all their guilty stays [Music] him but god died [Music] killing god [Music] [Music] unless it's received as a party [Music] [Music] thy pressure blood shall

let's just admit we have them a lot of us don't admit we have them you got saying we all sin come short of the glory of the lord but there's a sin killing blood and i'll promise you one thing folks that blood's still around this earth but once it leaves there's no more salvation for the gentiles the mercy seat there's a man sitting there but all of a sudden he's going to raise up and he's going to leave that throne and the altar is going to become smokey and he's going to stand out and he's going to change his garment [Music] to judgment and there's no way he's going to go oh wait a minute i forgot one no god don't forget once he steps off of that mercy seat it's over for us folks no more gentiles to be saved you'll be left here to the mercy of the elements you'll be left here to atomic waste you'll be hunted down like dogs and you'll be tormented before even there is a torment not trying to scare you i'm just telling you you need to start thinking of these things you know what
