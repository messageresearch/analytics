that god created uh a man first man first he created a spirit man when i was in denomination when i went to denominational churches they said god created man from the dust of the earth first man no when we read from the message god said no prophet said no it is not prophet saying that that is the holy spirit revealing the secret from genesis to revelation god created a spirit man in his own image he was he was like a spirit and he is spirit so that's why we are here to worship him in a spirit and in the truth with the holy ghost and with the word with the holy ghost and with the word hallelujah message and the holy spirit coming together the message and the holy ghost mechanics and the dynamics coming together glory to god hey amen this body made out of 16 elements that's right prophet god said this body this body made out of 16 elements it's a mechanical system it's a mechanical top to bottom you know the hair and all the eyes heartbeat and functioning of lungs and and kidneys and everything 16 elements god took 16 elements from the out of the dust of the ground and formed a man he formed a man and you all know that brother branham is talking about adam laying on some somewhere and he's like a statue until god breathed his her breath of life into him and he is just standing like a like a statue like like a doll like a big doll you know but when god breathed that life into him he become a living soul amen hallelujah praise god hallelujah god created a spirit of adam first then after he put that spirit in in that 16 elements body amen hallelujah praise god and you know what my precious brothers and sisters until god breathed that that breath of life into adam adam was a dead man right he wasn't a living soul right he's a dead man he need that that the power of god to that 16 elements to that system to that mechanical system to that body hallelujah praise god amen and here you see the the scripture says jesus said it is the spirit quicken it the flesh prophet nothing the words i speak unto you they are spirit and they are alive the spirit of god making us and molding us bringing us into that shape into the structure the structure of the stature of a perfect man amen the life of god the life of god the creating power the creativity power is in the holy ghost the holy ghost come and take that word and make us and shapes us into their perfection that's right praise god hallelujah amen and uh in genesis chapter 2 verse 2 verse 7 we already read this uh god breathed into adam nostrils and he became a living soul and in in new testament if you see in saint john chapter 20 and verse 22 and here we read and when he and when he had said this and when he had said this he jesus breathed on them the uh breathed on them and said unto them receive e the holy ghost say until then they all are like a you know uh bunch of dead people right yeah they know jesus they know the bible they know all those things but you know they they aired with jesus their fellowship with jesus they talked to jesus and they walked with jesus they they they are with jesus for three and a half years maybe 33 years they had seen with uh they had seen jesus you know all these 11 disciples but jesus came unto them and said and he breathed on them the breath of life that time he granted or he gave adam's spirit or the breath of life to adam this time he is talking about receive e the holy ghost receive e the holy ghost because that is giving us the power to walk to live according to the word of god when the spirit of truth come into you it will re it will lead you and guide you into all truths the sons and daughters of god led by the spirit of god see that is the spirit of god it's leading this this mechanical body the 16 elements and filling with the holy ghost and giving us giving that power and energizing that the word in in us which is the seed the spoken word and is making us to move forward to walk with god to pray god to fellowship with god to fellowship with god's people to come to church to interested in these in the word of god in god's things my precious brothers and sisters i may not know a grammar my cousin is traveling

hear the word of god we are here to hear the the language of the bible i mean the language of the bride the language of heavenly language is the pride language which is the word of god which is the message of the hour amen praise the name of the lord so that's why the scripture says it shall receive the power after that the holy ghost come upon you and he shall be witnesses unto me both in jerusalem and in all judea and in samaria and unto the uttermost part of the earth that means the holy ghost making them to go out like a steam engine in ancient days we have a steam engine without that fire without the steel steam that that couldn't move the steam engine like the scripture says he will baptize you with the holy ghost and fire amen that fire that holy ghost making us to move amen we are not able to walk according to the word of god but god in you and me and he is more than able to lead us and guide us into all truth glory hallelujah amen it shall receive the power my

nothing like this message nothing like this message my brother sister because i have seen jesus christ in this message i have seen the lord jesus christ moving in a supernatural way i was an atheist once upon a time how i the out this atheist and my cousin is traveling in the united states he is he is also it he was also a atheist i was a an atheist but what made us to believe god my god is real like the brother sung the song we all sing the song my god is real amen he is real he is true living god hell man our country believes in 333 million gods and goddesses but we believe in one true living god and his name is lord jesus christ in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and word was god and the word made flesh and dwelt among us praise god hallelujah aren't you glad for that amen first corinthians chapter 2 and verse 1 says here the saint paul the messenger of the first church age is speaking a pharisees a pharisee of pharisees and teachers of doctors of law you know he's a big scholar philosopher well educator person and he's he's trembling and he's worried about going to the people and he's talking like i'm i'm i'm in a weak i'm worried i'm i'm i'm i'm so fear see what is talking about here we can read that first corinthians chapter 2 and verse 1 to a few words here we can read and our brethren when i came to you came not with excellency of speech or of wisdom declaring unto you the testimony of god amen i'm not here to speak a man's wisdom amen excellency a grammar dictionary words very fancy languages no i don't have a idea you know i don't have a knowledge of that and here he says for i determined not to know anything among you not to know about this church not to know about that doctrine not to know about this doctrine no right right hallelujah amen for i determined not to know anything among you save jesus christ and him crucified exactly amen save jesus christ he was crucified and he said and i was with you i was with you in weakness and in fear and in much trembling and my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man's wisdom but in demonstration of the spirit and of power god's prophet said many people are taking the word and denying the power many people reading the message and denying the power see but we are here to demonstrate the power of the holy ghost the gospel came not by the word only yeah he said it's it's not the word only it's not the letter only it's not the message book only it is not the tape only it's something else the dynamic power of almighty god glory in the word hallelujah praise god my precious brothers and sisters i feel like at home amen feel comfortable i preach like this in my in my in my church praise god hallelujah and my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man's wisdom but in demonstration of the spirit and of power that your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men wisdom of men wisdom of men hallelujah men taking their own ideas about intellectual things and reasoning all doubts creating doubts and taking into the message is that right is that a pillar of fire is that the supernatural cloud over there oh oh is that the true discernment of the holy spirit is this the message is true reasoning of man's wisdom devil from the beginning that's the devil tricks always making a trap and putting all the believers and trying to put these believers a bride of christ trying to deceive them but bridesh will not deceived shall not be deceived praise god hallelujah this is the testing time my brother sister yes sir god is testing you when somebody is leaving this message that makes me more strong that makes me merry very you know very strong praise god hallelujah that your faith should not stand in the wisdom of man it is not why my mama came to church so that's why i believe lord jesus christ no it's not my father you know it is not depending upon some other faith this is your faith this is your personal relationship with god yes sir it is not my church it is not by man it is not my organization somebody is pulling you no when i was coming into the door and i've seen that you know the thing you know pulling this i read the poll yeah something pulling me to come to church something pulling me come to the word something pulling me i feel the poo we sing the song right we sing that song i feel the pull amen it is not that somebody brought you to the church of course somebody introduced jesus christ to you like peter did to andrew or andrew did to peter whoever you know somebody is pulling you somebody somebody brought you but something inside of inside when the word of the light come god's light shines upon you something inside that comes out miraculously it's a supernatural power of god touching your soul and from there the word god sees coming out and you say amen to that because the great i am the great amen is in you and me when the word of god shine in this last days so we said amen amen amen to malachi 4 amen to revelation 10 7 amen to luke 17 30 amen to acts 2 38 amen to all this word because the word is in you the word is nighty in your mouth in your heart that is what we preach amen the same word praise god hallelujah that your faith should not stand should not never should not at any any other circumstance any circumstance you should not stand on your your mama's or your purpose no of course they are examples to us but we got to have a personal relationship with god that is the most important thing personal relationship right personal thing my when i came to the lord the lord touched my body and i fell down on the floor and i'm rolling like a crazy and i i when i stood up all my body's shivering like crazy and i don't know i scared to death i'm trying to run away from that place and the brother said don't worry don't fear don't afraid brother god is here to to to to save you and he preached the love of god and i i don't know the love of god i supposed to i have supposed to die when i was in my mother's womb as six months baby my mom attempted suicide in india you know they are not a christian people they are some people are nominal christians some people are hindu muslim all different uh you know religious people my mom attempted suicide she jumped in the well which is 30 30 feet with 30 feet deep with the water the dwell and i was i was in a room six months

lost his job and everything you know so what happened you know my dad tortured her many ways but when she jumped in that well and two men had seen that you know thing while she was jumping in the well and someone ran there and they jumped in the well and they saved us but god who is rich in mercy he knows me before i borrow before i'm there my god is real he's true living god and at the age of 13 i was i was trying to become something you know a movie director or something you know at the age of 13 i was an atheist but god changed me some people all the young young people came to the to the message and they left the pentecostal church and they're having ministry at our our area and they are uh rented three rooms house and uh you know they're having a prayer meetings over uh you know over there and every day you know so i went there and they they preached the gospel to me and they when they prayed i fell down and you know the power touched me and i was so wonder about that my precious brothers and sisters this is a personal experience with god this is my personal experience and i came into the salvation by the grace of god by the help of the lord he he loved me and he saved me and he redeemed me from all sin and he washed me he claims me and he purified me sanctified me with his precious blood and i got baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ in 1995 and since then i was

scriptures heavens and earth shall pass away but god's word shall not pass away praise god when the mechanics come to the stage you know into the presence of god the dynamic power of god touch that mechanic the heart amen hallelujah and gives us faith without works is dead but when you have the seed faith a mustard seed and you have that word power in your mouth in your heart and when the holy ghost comes and he will lead that faith he will lead you and guide you into all truth so that's why he said he shall listen the power to move on to walk to travel to preach i'm not able to preach this

you talk much you love much you eat much you walk much you do all things much but you can't pray see pray prayer we are not able to pray see and sometimes you know your mind is not cooperating with your body or your body is not cooperating with your soul but god knows that this flesh is weak but you know what brother branham said here i want to read that we try to make our weakness excu excuses see we want to tell how big we are how great we are i think that's one of the things that god gave me me the text for was to get that out of our mind we think we are very big you know we are so and so so forth but you know what god don't like that see here brother said there's little things that we do and that's what we come to church for is to find out where our faults are and the things that we might better ourselves by if we come to church for any other objective than this i am afraid we won't get too much out of coming to church we must come to chu come to find our weakness right say there are some weaknesses but people they don't find that weaknesses they don't like to find them you know you know they don't like them you know find our bad places and see how little we are and put our trust in somebody that's strong we strong the mighty god amen who is strong the holy ghost who is strong the message amen nothing like this message right to whom shall we go if you leave this message

genesis they know all the seals book they know the churches all the literal you know they can take everything godliness everything good wonderful but you know what people in the last days having a form of godliness but denying the power denying the power where you get the power from the world that's right hallelujah where you get the power in the church with god's people the fellowship by redemption also prophet preached on a message called fellowship by power right fellowship by power fellowship by redemption glory hallelujah amen denying the power of thereof amen praise the name of

presence of god always amen for your bought with a prize therefore glorify god in your body and your spirit which are gods praise the name of the lord my precious brothers and sisters tonight here i read some scriptures i would like to read from the word of god amen and then from there i want to go to the message i've seen some people that don't carry the bible i don't understand why right but this bible my prophet of god my god's prophet came from this message from this bible amen the seven seals in the bible seven churches in the bible prophet william branham in the bible amen everything came from the bible amen this bible amen so that's why prophet said this is the word this is the god's word a god in written form praise the lord hallelujah and here i want to read some quotes what brother branham is talking about i have often said the greatest enemy i got is william branham the greatest enemy is william branham means the greatest enemy samson shetty mantara the greatest enemy you can put your name he is the one that gets in god's way he's the one that gets lazy god don't like the lazy people no we are overcomers through our lord jesus christ my grandma used to tell me don't be lazy don't be lazy come on go to school come on work come on help me that come on help me this because i ate a military man's salt that means my grandfather was a military man he's a soldier everything right everything right in time punctual everything you know like that so she she taught me to be very you know punctual and very sharp very active and work hard you know yes we got to do that amen see he is the one that get uh is the he is the one that gets lazy and he is the one gets gets to a place sometimes where he thinks he can do something about it and when he does that shows god right out of the picture but when i can get rid of that guy when i can get to a place that is out of the way then god can come over and do things that william branham knows nothing about say i like that how brother branham he's not elevating someone said oh brother samson sherry you elevate brother branham to jesus christ see what he's talking about here what he said the greatest enemy is william branham i want to glorify my god in my body in my soul in my spirit i want to glorify god i want to give my glory i want to give all the glory honor praise to the lord jesus christ thank you lord he is the one though he is the one he is the only one uh worthy of all praise right amen and here what brother uh saint paul you know god is talking to saint paul he said and i'm reading this quotes from uh the message called perfect strength by perfect weakness 1961 paragraph 40 42 2 and 181 i'm not reading all the message book but few quotes here and here brother uh brother branham said god said to paul my strength is perfect in your weakness my strength becomes more perfect as you become more weaker the more you can yield to me the better i can use the more you can get forget about you education the more you can forget about your denomination the more you can forget about your stuff and yield yourself to me the more i can use cause you become weak a weak weaker vessel right many times people think that my wife is a weaker vessel and this woman is awakened vessel and you two brother sister you also me also this body is weak that's what the scripture says that's what the scripture says because man you know god didn't say man is weak but woman in peter right and as a bride of jesus christ we are woman spiritually speaking we are weak in this body but the spirit of god is making us strong praise god hallelujah amen and here brother branham is talking about you know jesus see who would think of the humility of his own son when he was born in a manger in a manual barn in a cow stall was wrapped in swaddling's cloth see he could have come through a palace he could have come down the couriers of heaven and full of anger salute angel salute but he choose to make christ the example for us and brought him in humility he never trained him in the schools of this world he trained him by his own power power because this body is weak this body is weak jesus became weak one time and he's crying unto the father god lord god if you will you can take this cuff from me that is the flesh speaking to the spirit god amen see his own power so could completely heal himself not to the thoughts of a man that's why jesus said whatever i heard from my father i speak unto you i'm not speaking by my own self this is not my own my my own thinking or my own minds my whatever you know it's it's something from god right amen hallelujah and or the strength of the world but ill himself to the power of god hallelujah the power of god is not denying the power of god why should we right no you know some people think in in my country brother samson we have a lot of message books and we have tapes and we can stay at home and we instead of going to church instead of going to church i said no sir you will have a power you will get the strength and power when you come together as a bride of jesus christ so that's why prophet of god said the spirit of god speaking through the prophet said nations uniting churches uniting and the bride is uniting uniting with what with the word with the word not by man's idea not but not by reasoning things it's uniting by the word of god by the revelation of jesus christ and hear what brother branham said god soldiers heroes they had to get weak before they could get strong god's soldiers god's heroes wow they had to get weak before they could get strong out of their weakness they were made strong hebrews chapter 11 34 here's something to console us here's something that encourages out of weakness and humility god chooses the people to build his kingdom out of amen if we ever get to heaven if we ever stand in the presence of god with his church will stand in a bunch of people that's been weak and rejected that's been weak and rejected oh nothing like this message my precious brothers and sisters when i went to some churches they said upon this rock i will build my church the pastor is preaching on the scripture and he said he he he's talking about that scripture said oh jesus pointed on some rock and he's trying he's telling his disciple that he's going to build the church on that rock that is what they are teaching at that day he shall know that i am in the father and father in me and i in you and you and me what they said you know jesus christ said this you know what a wonderful scripture but there is no more explanation they don't understand what that means until the prophet of god came onto the on the scene he said upon this rock means not as some some kind of substance not some kind of a place he's not trying to show them uh he's not showing them he's not pointing them any other stone or rock it is a divine revelation a solid revelation it's a revelation of god upon this revelation upon this rock upon this unchangeable word of god upon this solid revelation i will build my church amen amen this message whoo nothing like this message i love this message because we are born to believe this message we are bound to receive this message we want to have this message in our hearts hallelujah glory to god hallelujah well stand in a bunch of people that's been weak and rejected and cast out by the world and know it nothings i can read lots of quotes here but i i need to watch i'm not in india praise god hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah and i want to read this one quote you know here brother branham is talking about moses whenever you get licked and realized realized you're licked and then come back and humble yourself get weak find out your find out you are human and there none of your intellectual can do to human weakness will never be used of god excuses witnesses will not be used of god god by the human weakness pours people you are spurs himself into you then he uses himself you just become an instrument certainly you have got to get yourself out of the way moses learned moses learned human weakness is real good he learned it so well till when god called him he had six weaknesses he had six weaknesses that he could argue against god's call did you ever study in the first part of exodus the six weaknesses i got them wrote the route out here i want you to listen to them the first weakness he had was a lack of a message second weakness he had was a lack of authority the third weakness he had was lack of e-l-o-q-e-n-e-n-c-e how you pronounce that sir [Music] e-l-o-q-u-e-n-c-e eloquence okay thank you the fourth was adaption a.d a p t i won not adoption and action the fifth one was success the sixth one was exception six weaknesses and god wants this man god wants this man hallelujah with six weaknesses he warns god wants him to use god wants him to go and deliver that people two million people when he came when he realized who you are who he was so you know god really you know god really used that man in a mighty way amen praise the lord hallelujah my precious brothers and sisters here it is almost 8 15 and you gave me a time at 7 15. if there is some more time i can read some quotes but you know if not so maybe god willing next time so anyhow my precious brothers and sisters this mechanics i haven't gone uh i haven't uh read uh you know the scriptures you know what uh uh you know the prophet of god uh the quotes here what he said but uh okay okay thank you i don't want to uh take your time i know you know your your children has to go to schools and you got to work but i won't i'm go i'm move fast the sign of the this time new york in 1963 he said we said last night we have so much of mechanics and not the dynamics now my body is the mechanics but my body will not operate without the dynamics the spirit see and the spirit operates my body right amen brings it in control like an automobile i like this how brother branham talking about this mechanics and dynamics and he took our cars and convention you know combustion combustion yeah like an automobile with no gasoline in it with no firing power see no matter how fine the dynamics or i mean excuse me i got my accent of course you you you uh hear different kinds of accents my i got my accent but one day we don't have any accent we will speak in one language hey man the mechanics is fixed up the cylinders and the points the plugs and whatever more it's got to have the current also you've got to take those together that's the way god is it's got to get a believer with god to make the contact then something is going to happen amen amen that made the same dynamic power fall upon the church right in the early church and so that's why saint thomas came to india amen in 1890s and all the bunch of all you know uh you know brahmins and hindu priests they went and they're worshiping sun god and you know offering the water to the sun god and this man disciple thomas came to india and he had seen this those hindu people what they are doing and they said what are you doing they said we are praying to our god and offering this water so why don't your god is receiving that water or your offering then they don't have answer and he told them if i give if i offer water to my god it won't fall down and he went into that ocean you know he he just prayed lord accept in jesus name nothing one drop never fall down hallelujah praise god that is the power that is the power when brother gary walker visited us in year 2012 in the midday of the meeting all you know our we had over uh 4 000 people attended in the meetings in four days meetings four thousand people attended and everywhere you see the people the roads was blocked and you know everywhere you see the people but you know what happened one one in the midday in the in the day time was very humidity and hot and all of a sudden while brother brother gary walker preaching i was interpreting for him all of a sudden right side from the right side we felt a cool breeze a cool air coming through all of a sudden the atmosphere was changed the weather changed and you know on top of our tent a cloud was appeared cloud appeared except our meeting place was covered by the cloud and uh ministering brethren all the sitting the brothers are pointing me on top and i don't understand what they are talking about but all of a sudden i felt some cool priests coming from the right side and i oh this is very nice we can go from here to ours hallelujah praise god so the brother gary is preaching and i'm interpreting feel good you know that is nothing but what i what i believe the holy ghost the whirlwind the wind hallelujah glory amen among his people right amen he is shaking the world up and down and ah that cloud was appeared and it is amazing a great testimony and every day 200 people coming in the prayer line and we are laying hands all the minister brothers on the platform laying hands on the people and the people going through the prayer line and a boy named by murali 11 years boy he spoke he's a deaf boy not able to speak from his childhood from his birth 11 years boy next day morning he started speaking he said hallelujah amen i said what's your name thank you saints what's your name he said morally and i called upon the stage i have the videos and i asked him to speak i said hallelujah and he said hallelujah praise the lord my name is sunso that is the first time he's speaking in the meetings see that is the holy ghost the gospel came not by the word only by the power and the demonstration of the holy ghost amen um silver and gold is not with us we have what we have we give you that that is the name of the lord jesus christ brother gary walker asked me what can i what what what can we bring to you from australia brother samson what would you like to bring us to to you india uh bill samson i said brother gary we would like to see the power and the demonstration of the holy ghost in the meetings bring the word with the power and the demonstration that's all we want that's all we need because that that that the dynamic power going to change these 16 elements body and it's going to change in a twinkle of glory hallelujah praise the name of the lord glory to god amen my precious brothers and sisters uh here brother brahm said it won't move no matter how good the mechanics is until the dynamics comes when the dynamics comes the fire is made to connect with the octane in the gasoline and when the explores it causes a combustion combustion moves every motion every move for e is the same yesterday today and forever that's the resurrection that's the resurrection that's the real power of god mechanics with dynamics message books with the power of god message with the word with the power with the holy ghost born again experience dynamic power glory notice it's the spirit that quickens it is the spark that fires not the gas that fires it is the it is the fire it is the spark ah brother adam said how much you got i don't care you've got to be have that fire amen hallelujah it is not the gas that fires it's the spark that fires the gas see praise the name of the lord hallelujah amen until the church becomes both dynamics and mechanics and the spirit of god that moved him to do the things that he did if he hit on 16 slenders so will the bride amen hallelujah but he said john 14 12 he that believeth on me the works that i do he shall do also i will give him a change of my dynamics and in his mechanics that's world will not be able to withstand it and i will rise him up up again in the last day that's the easter's message right yeah he is speaking in the message called it is the rising of sun 1965 you all know that amen together that's the eastern message the dynamics and the mechanics together right the dynamics without the mechanics without the dynamics no good right that's right no good neither the dynamics without the mechanics you can scream and shout and jump and up and down all you want to deny this word it won't do any good you are just cranking around the pistons of got that spark on the fire but no gasoline to fire it by right hallelujah when i'm preaching you know in my church all of a sudden the snake came into the into the you know building you don't see that here recently we had a minister's meeting and uh one of our minister brother killed that snake i told the brothers to you know you sit here and fellowship and i i just walked through the door and the snake was in the corner was there in the corner and i didn't notice that and i walked very fast and after i went outside the brothers in the platform they shouted and brother there is a there is something snake over there and i thought uh i'm outside so one of the brothers took the rod and he killed that snake but that won't bother us how people sit for two hours sometimes three hours and they scream and shout and you know they they yield and they they they they pull on the gift praise the lord hallelujah right of course they they have to work too you know they go to work like a daily wage of slavers from morning nine o'clock to evening five o'clock they work hard and they get only you know maybe 200 300 500 rupees per day you know that is like a five dollar something like that you know so anyway my precious brothers and sisters you know the mechanics and dynamics we have a mechanics in our life but we got to have we need more of dynamic power which is the supernatural power of god which is the holy ghost amen that is running the church that is running you that is moving you that is moving me that brought me here and i traveled 24 hours in the plane and 10 000 miles other side of the globe it is almost 12 hours difference so that's why jesus said one is on the field one is on the bed see and romans like we read the scriptures romans 8 11 it's brother adam is talking it is if the spirit that raised up jesus from the dead be in you it will also quicken your mortal bodies if the spirit that raised upon jesus from the dead if it be in you it is also quicken your moral bodies quicken it what does the word quicken mean the greek word means to be brought to life after death hallelujah there is the gate of worship worshiping in the spirit and in the truth mechanics and dynamics together a spirit and the word logos and rhema word and the power and spirit amen you see what i mean if the spirit that raised up jesus from the dead dwells in you it will quicken make alive your mortal bodies because it's already alive and when it comes into your body it brings your whole body subject to it right wow all right praise god thank you lord subject to what the word of god we may read we must study we may hear we may do all these things but subject to word anchor to word right that never shaked me that never shaked my faith when my my uncle offered me to come into that religion or into their denomination never one of my cousin also asked me to come and to join with him he's also a good man and he's a pentecostal man and he said we have a nice bible college we will offer you don't worry about feast don't worry about anything lots of choices lots of opportunities we are not moses we are not elijah we are not peter we're not not we are not paul but we are saving serving the same god we are serving the same god i love that hallelujah amen it brings your whole body to subject subject toward the word of god if it is in you if it is in you the holy ghost makes us and molds us and brings us to anchor to that word anchor to christ christ is the anointed word of this hour hallelujah i'm great dynamic power hallelujah and here brother branham uh do i have time yeah so here uh brother brandon looking onto jesus 1964 he said the mechanics don't run the church it's the dynamics the holy ghost that gets into the word and it's not seminary that teaches you all the theology and the greek interpretations but it's the dynamics of the holy ghost right in there to set that a fire and to bring it to pass and to make it live just exactly what the promised world is for this however i like that nothing like this message to whom shall we go lord amen without this message if we leave this pleasure to whom shall we go glory i don't care about anyone i i already anchored i'm i'm in love affair with my lord and i was engaged i mean got exposed to my lord right in first church age i was with him right amen hallelujah and i was married to him right like paul said one husband not three one husband one husband not three hallelujah and here the word and the spirit hallelujah now the mechanics the dynamics it takes mechanics and dynamics the world and the spirit they are one that gives life not only this mortal body but it has to be you we got to have that power of the holy ghost or the spirit baptism of the holy ghost a born-again experience a personal relationship with god not depending upon someone's idea if my father if my if my if my dad preaching this message automatically you know when i was you know if i grow up with him i always say amen to that but it has to come to you in with a personal experience oh it is not like uh if my father left the message i'm not leaving that right see it is not like that it is that that you got anchored with christ with the message of the hover that's the truth that's the dynamic power it anchored our soul nothing can change you right right amen praise god hallelujah i'm so glad for that please pray for me brothers and sisters to stay with this to stay right with this world to serve god honesty sincerely carefully faithfully in his vineyard i want to be a good christian i want to live according to the word of god i'm a weak i'm a weak i'm a weak person in the body but the holy ghost i can do everything through christ who strengthened me that is jesus christ in you and me i died every day i died every day that's what paul said because we got to die in our minds in our attitude in our character in our natures you know we got to die we got to die we have to die amen oh praise the lord hallelujah here in the in the message say the message it is the rising of the sun he said he wasn't the word but the word god himself the dynamics in the word that made the body of jesus christ called stiff and dead in grave shake into life and raise again rise again and roll away the stone i am that he i'm he that was dead so dead till the sun said he was dead the moon said he was dead the star said he was dead all nature said he was dead and now the whole world has to recognize that he is alive again he was not only the mechanics 33 and a half years mechanics but he said god's word he was the dynamics to prove right i was i am and i will be amen hallelujah praise the lord hallelujah and here brother brahma said and he is being the groom and the bride has to come forth because it is a part of him and it can only be the manifestation of the fulfilling of all the revelation any others has spoke of the bride right it can only manifest if it is does something different from the groom it isn't the bride because she is flesh of his flesh born of his bone life of his life power of his power she is him that's right she he's him when he appears saint john said sean the disciple john the divine said when he appears when he comes we will be like him she is him this message according to the word this message came from the word this message and the word is same hallelujah i love this message under any circumstances i am not a compromiser i don't want to compromise never in the list praise god because it is not samson shetty it is god anchored my soul to the christ to the anointed word of this hour praise the lord and my uncle looked at me oh poor guy losing all the opportunities and poor poor guy losing all the benefits of god and blessings of god i may hear a great man of god i'm asking him to come and he's refusing and he told my mom he told my dad and he told my people and my people said we don't know samson is samson you know he he is going to stand with that message because that is the truth amen that is the truth that is the the lord hallelujah thus saith the lord here i am coming from all over india he's a nation a people believes in 333 million gods and goddesses and with all isms hinduism buddhism sikhism jainism muslim islam all isms but god has his bride amen god has his children god is raising up with a dynamic power because he placed that he sold he planted the seed before the foundation of the world hallelujah before the foundation of the world he planted that seed word in the bride that is in in in india in philippines in jamaica in central america all over the world so that's why he said go ye and preach or go ye and shine the light shine the light when you are shining the light the seed god seed of god will come out no denomination stop them no you some stop them no nothing stop them hallelujah no they will stop them when that light strikes hallelujah like prophet said when that light strikes that that that that seed it will come out right praise the lord hallelujah she is him as men and women are one and women take from us from his side she had taken a spirit the feminist spirit from him the flesh from his side made both mechanics and dynamics the wife so that's why my god's prophet said now i want you i want to call you mrs jesus mrs jesus let us be glad and rejoice because the marriage of the lamb is come that is present tense come present tense now uniting with word with word wife and husband came together in a bidding union bridegroom and bride became one wife and husband now the mechanics and dynamics came together praise the name of the lord the spirit of him and the flesh of him and put together and made mechanics and die in a mix hallelujah praise the name of the lord my precious brothers and sisters i know i'm i'm i'm watching the time and uh you know but i'm i'm so glad this evening that i i preached uh by the grace of the lord by the help of the lord you know we all are you know mechanics and we are looking for the god's power every day every day to revive our souls spirits minds hearts to move forward to go forward to walk with him to talk with him daily every moment to have a personal relationship with our lord jesus christ with our groom no gaps i'm here and my wife is in india and you will see my wife uh you know i will show you you know yeah but you know my wife suvarna means pure gold one day i was here in the streets but something i feel like uh i went to there or you know like my wife is walking in the yard and he's walking she's walking in the kitchen and i called her and uh i said where are you i said god bless you suvarna praise the lord and she said god bless you praise the lord how are you doing all these things okay so what are you doing now uh she said i'm here let me tell you this i said let me let me say uh are you in the yard i think you are in the yard walking in the yard right she said okay now you're slowly going into you're going into the you're trying to go into the house and i what she had done i already told her everything because you know what i felt that way yeah something feeling right you know something you feel and she said everything exactly right what you said right now i'm here in the you know right uh and uh just five minutes back you are in the yard and you just walked in the kitchen and you're just you know feeding a nursery to the little baby
