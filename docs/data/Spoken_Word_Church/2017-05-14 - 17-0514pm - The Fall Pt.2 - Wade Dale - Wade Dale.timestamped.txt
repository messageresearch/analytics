[18:42] best and worst out of you Hank Henry hey
[18:44] don't buddy
[18:45] I asked ordered him up there to see you

[18:52] just want to make sure he sat down with
[18:53] his mom with his right one he's had so
[18:56] many mamas over here on this church till
[18:58] uh hello he but you know what he's in
[19:04] the image of his parents you know what
[19:07] we're still talking about now we being
[19:09] in the image of the Almighty God but
[19:11] like brother Louie said good have our
[19:12] visitors with us which are not
[19:15] anymore the pageant's could good to see
[19:16] you fine folks I must close to
[19:20] Murfreesboro North Kerala I mean North
[19:22] Carolina Murfreesboro Tennessee
[19:23] hey brother Joseph Harmons church so
[19:25] good to see them if you got your Bibles
[19:28] let's go ahead and turn right back to
[19:29] where we were last Sunday the Genesis
[19:32] 1:26 and we'll continue on the thought
[19:35] and we're still speaking on the fall
[19:38] fall of man if we can if we can get this
[19:46] going in the right direction we can
[19:48] maybe see where property God said we see
[19:53] where we come from see what we're doing
[19:55] here and see where we're going is that
[19:56] right all right so that's what we're
[19:57] going to try to do is to see where we
[20:01] come from because jesus said I came from
[20:02] God and go back to God right and if you
[20:05] have the same God inside to use and you
[20:06] must have to be able to say I come from
[20:08] God and I go back to God and man cuz
[20:10] that's where that we see this man has
[20:14] come into the image of God not the man
[20:17] you're looking at now right
[20:19] the man you're looking at now but if
[20:21] you're born again it's the one inside of
[20:23] you that looks just like
[20:25] on a night I got a revelation today
[20:30] we're all going to get one of these and
[20:34] second service you're going to sit there
[20:36] and twist it and turn it the whole
[20:37] service that way if you fall asleep it
[20:39] will hit the floor and you'll be
[20:40] embarrassed but if you hold over to this
[20:43] thing and you start spinning it we're
[20:44] going to make one that says Amen when it
[20:46] goes around we just at the head man Amen
[20:50] amen brother patient sometimes these
[20:54] people go to the Land of Nod and they
[20:57] nod off a little bit so it's kind of
[20:59] weird us having service at two o'clock
[21:01] though because we do eat and then we
[21:02] kind of sit down and sometimes we have
[21:06] to do a little Jericho March to get
[21:08] everybody wait but that's okay let the
[21:11] Word of God make you excited and you'll
[21:12] not have to go to sleep Genesis 1:26
[21:15] verse 20 through 28 and let's bow our
[21:17] heads before we get started the Lord
[21:21] Jesus we pray today Lord that you would
[21:23] come among us in a special way take care
[21:25] of the ones that are sick once you're
[21:28] lost once it needs you father we pray
[21:31] today Lord that you'd be the preeminent
[21:32] one in this building father be the
[21:34] preeminent one in our hearts and our
[21:36] minds you take over the service Lord and
[21:38] you'd be the one that does the speaking
[21:40] you'd be the one that does the hearing
[21:41] Lord just take care of the ones that are
[21:43] not here Lord the ones that are
[21:45] traveling many many of us are the
[21:47] congregation or with their mothers or
[21:49] traveling with their family great it
[21:51] should be with em father and give them
[21:52] traveling mercy be with the ones Lord in
[21:56] the foreign fields the missionaries give
[21:57] them Lord fruit for their labor
[21:59] we pray that you just be with each one
[22:01] that's here's our visitors Lord to speed
[22:03] with them give them strength Lord as
[22:05] they journey back home and may they stay
[22:07] as the ones on the master today our
[22:09] heart has burned because we've talked to
[22:11] the Lord Jesus Christ along the way
[22:13] through the bride of Jesus Christ we
[22:17] thank you for all things add your many
[22:19] blessings to what we're fixing to read
[22:21] Lord we know it's already blessed but
[22:22] bless us Lord as we listen to what
[22:24] you're saying in Jesus name Amen
[22:26] the Bible says Genesis 1:26 is and God
[22:29] said let us make man in our image after
[22:32] our likeness and let them have dominion
[22:34] over the fish of the sea and over the
[22:36] fowl of the air over the cattle and over
[22:39] all the earth and over every creeping
[22:41] thing that creepeth upon the earth and
[22:43] God create so God created man in his own
[22:46] image and the image of God created he
[22:48] him male and female created he them so
[22:51] there's some plurality going on here and
[22:53] God blessed them and God said unto them
[22:56] be fruitful and multiply and replenish
[22:58] the earth I want you to watch this
[22:59] because we're not going to go back to it
[23:00] maybe but if you're watching just a few
[23:03] minutes if we have time when God created
[23:07] the animals he told them to multiply and
[23:11] replenish and then it was a period now
[23:16] when this image was formed it was in the
[23:21] image of God and he said be fruitful and
[23:24] multiply and replenish the earth and
[23:26] subdue it and have dominion and man he
[23:31] didn't give the animals dominion over
[23:33] the earth he gave this man he's talking
[23:35] about he gave him dominion over the
[23:38] earth and God blessed them and God said
[23:40] unto them be fruitful and multiply and
[23:41] replenish the earth and subdue it and
[23:44] have dominion over the fish of the sea
[23:46] and over the fowl of the air and over
[23:47] every living thing that moveth upon the
[23:49] earth you may be seated in lore that is
[23:51] blessing to the reading of the word now
[23:53] we're going to not only for the sake of
[23:57] the visitors but we're going to back up
[23:59] just a minute on what we were talking
[24:01] about last Sunday if you would pull up
[24:03] the Hebrew lexicon because a lot of
[24:04] people have a problem when you say
[24:07] created when he comes to God but you got
[24:10] to remember I'm going to read you here
[24:11] in a minute we read it last Sunday where
[24:13] brother branham's did God's first
[24:14] creation with himself and boy that the
[24:17] theologians sitting in the in the
[24:19] congregation that day probably brother
[24:21] Larry was looking cross-eyed and
[24:23] wondered what book he got out of how God
[24:26] created God you know you but you know
[24:28] what that's what's the property God said
[24:30] and that's what we're going to look at
[24:31] here in just a minute is we're going to
[24:33] see that he didn't he didn't create as
[24:36] in from nothing to something like he did
[24:40] the earth remember faith is the
[24:43] substance Lewis was reading it Wednesday
[24:45] night phases substance of things hoped
[24:46] for the evidence of things not see
[24:48] things were forms of things that weren't
[24:50] seen but now look and like I was showing
[24:52] him back here
[24:53] now he preached on the light but if
[24:54] you'll read over there in Genesis 3 it
[24:56] says and God said let there be light he
[25:00] didn't create that light that light
[25:03] never had a beginning and that light
[25:05] never had an end that light is not the
[25:07] light of the Sun or the light of the
[25:09] moon that was the light of God a man so
[25:12] he didn't create that that was always
[25:15] there now what what we're doing is is
[25:18] we're coming to a place now to where we
[25:20] see more of this eternal God and we're
[25:23] able to understand him that all right
[25:26] God listen let me give you this real
[25:29] revelation God does not need to
[25:32] understand God he is who he is you and I
[25:37] need to understand who God is and he
[25:40] wants us to and you say well I would
[25:41] have done in a different way well then
[25:43] you would have been gone but this is the
[25:45] only way God had for us right here and
[25:48] we must go this way because you know why
[25:51] he saw somebody wouldn't understand him
[25:54] in this form a man's alright alright so
[25:58] now look we know that word create is
[26:01] something that we as human beings we
[26:03] look at something we said God created
[26:04] this man in his own image and in his
[26:08] likeness what we think well he had a
[26:11] beginning any have you know anything has
[26:13] a beginning has got to have an end but
[26:15] no let's look at this word shape or form
[26:20] because really like what we're talking
[26:23] about last Sunday all the elements in
[26:27] the earth nothing ever came from the
[26:30] moon or the Stars everything that you
[26:32] see on the earth all this within the
[26:34] Garden of Eden this can just would by
[26:37] generation generation back generations
[26:39] if this would I'm beating on today you
[26:43] know what's good about God God can tell
[26:45] you where this piece of wood came from
[26:47] and what tree it was in when he created
[26:49] it in the Garden of Eden a man what a
[26:51] mighty God we serve but this was in the
[26:54] Garden of Eden but what did man do man
[26:56] took plastic metal rubber hello and
[27:03] created a car now they didn't create it
[27:07] like we we think create from nothing no
[27:09] gods only one who can do that but when
[27:11] he put it on earth he made man a lesser
[27:13] God and man put all these elements
[27:15] together and created or formed a car so
[27:20] a car was in the Garden of Eden brother
[27:22] Graham said television was in the Garden
[27:23] of Eden
[27:24] amen then all right I believe Moses
[27:26] looked at a television one of these big
[27:28] 16 inch high-definition television Moses
[27:32] was watching what happened in the garden
[27:34] hey man is that all right because he saw
[27:37] he had to see what was going on - real -
[27:40] write that down but here we see God he
[27:42] created man let us make man in our own
[27:45] image after our likeness
[27:47] now if God looked like an animal then we
[27:52] must look like an animal but God was a
[27:55] man wait a minute there's no was in God
[28:00] God is a man and God forever will be a
[28:05] man a man that's why I am that's why you
[28:08] use that phrase I am why I am I am 60
[28:11] million years ago and I am 60 million
[28:13] years this way I am because it's
[28:16] ever-present see what this God is doing
[28:19] though he is unfolding himself so that
[28:21] we can understand what he is and then
[28:24] look this law says that creation he God
[28:27] created man this word comes from
[28:29] creators of new conditions and
[28:31] circumstances the property God told us
[28:34] he said God was self existent
[28:36] and then all of a sudden out of that God
[28:38] come what an attribute hey man that all
[28:42] right grab one of these and start
[28:45] spinning them an attribute comes out and
[28:49] it's not a different part of God it's
[28:52] God made manifest in another form a man
[28:55] called the logos not the second person
[28:58] of the Trinity or the third or not even
[29:00] the first brother Thomas thank you very
[29:04] much you don't have no shoes on
[29:08] I know he said thank you very much
[29:11] nothing like a drop preacher of new
[29:14] conditions and circumstance what's God
[29:16] doing God is what he's bringing
[29:18] something into being so that he can see
[29:20] it no so that we can see where we come
[29:23] from what we're doing hearing after what
[29:25] property God told us in the seals he
[29:26] said we need to know where we came from
[29:28] what we're doing here and where we're
[29:31] going and man so if we can look back
[29:33] here in Genesis the property God told us
[29:35] this was the seed chapter of the Bible
[29:38] everything began in Genesis that's why I
[29:41] love Genesis and see my book in Genesis
[29:44] my Bible is about tore out because I
[29:46] love the book of Genesis because it
[29:48] brings everything to light prepping
[29:50] God's at all denominations came out of
[29:52] Genesis and then the Word of God was in
[29:55] Genesis in the beginning was the word
[29:56] and the Word was with God in Word was
[29:59] God and then the Word was made flesh but
[30:03] that word create don't let it stumble
[30:04] you where there was nothing know what
[30:06] God's doing is God is showing himself in
[30:09] a form that he and like I said before in
[30:13] the book of Genesis 130 times the word
[30:18] God has used God God God God said God
[30:22] said God said God said right here he
[30:25] also said God said and God said let us
[30:28] make man a man thirty times now listen
[30:32] let's read the next one which is
[30:34] lightness we know what lightness is if
[30:37] you look in the mirror that's you a man
[30:40] when God looked at him he said that's my
[30:43] boy he looks just like me mmm you know
[30:46] what he liked that so lightness is what
[30:49] of resemblance an image there was
[30:51] something that came off of God not a
[30:54] second person my third person not a
[30:56] first person but the person of God just
[30:59] steps over in a form so that you and I
[31:01] can understand who he is and man that
[31:02] all right so that you and I can
[31:04] understand listen God is all-knowing he
[31:07] never what he is not one second older
[31:08] than when he said this in the beginning
[31:15] but he had a plan and he had a purpose
[31:19] he had a way of getting himself in
[31:22] spreche in an eternal way but he's doing
[31:26] it through you and I in time that's what
[31:28] I told him this morning in a Sunday
[31:30] School class what a paradox something
[31:33] comes from eternity comes down into time
[31:36] walks for 30-something years in time in
[31:40] a flesh body a man steps over in another
[31:44] dimension and then comes back into this
[31:47] dimension in another form not another
[31:50] person in another form called the Holy
[31:52] Ghost and that same guy's here now that
[31:56] same person is here now and now a many
[31:59] membered body not just one person you
[32:02] said that's simple it's profound and you
[32:07] know what there's one person who can't
[32:09] understand that that's the devil you
[32:11] know why cuz he can't get that God that
[32:13] created him inside of me but you and I
[32:18] can God just took them turn the table
[32:21] it's an all right Satan you do what you
[32:23] want to do here I'm gonna have the last
[32:26] laugh I'm gonna have the last laugh cuz
[32:28] I got something I'm saving for you and
[32:30] it's called my bride hey ma'am because
[32:34] that's what he was doing for Adam
[32:36] because remember when he formed this
[32:38] Genesis 1:26 man like we're talking
[32:39] about last Sunday and let's look at the
[32:41] first quote he formed something out of
[32:45] himself but not another person not
[32:48] another not another entity no what an
[32:53] adoption 1960 let us before we go into
[32:56] further go by Genesis 1:26 so now what's
[32:59] he talkin about Genesis 1:26
[33:00] I'll pick it up when see when God made
[33:02] man before he made man he called himself
[33:05] el al la lah Elohim the word means in
[33:09] Hebrew the self-existent that's why that
[33:11] God 30 times in the first chapter of
[33:14] Genesis it says God God created God did
[33:17] this God did that God form that alright
[33:20] then when you get to Genesis 1:26 he
[33:23] still said and God said let us make man
[33:26] and God blessed them now if he would
[33:29] have changed his form at that time
[33:33] it would have been something else that
[33:36] he made hear what I'm saying this
[33:40] Genesis 1:26 man when it was formed or
[33:43] created God was still set existing not
[33:47] all right you know why because it was
[33:49] God in another form a man but now watch
[33:54] what he does though the self-existent
[33:56] all by himself
[33:58] nothing existed before him he was all
[34:00] the existence there ever was self
[34:02] existent one now let's going down
[34:04] further roll it up but in Genesis 2 now
[34:06] what do you do in Genesis 2 he put that
[34:08] Genesis 1:26 man into a flesh body is
[34:11] that Alright a man while read between a
[34:13] minute but in Genesis 2 when he made man
[34:16] it's an iamb Yahoo jvu H Yahweh or
[34:19] anyway Jehovah what it mean I am the
[34:21] always distant one who has created
[34:22] something off of myself to be a son of
[34:24] mine are temporary are an amateur little
[34:26] one of mine now you go to Genesis 2 if
[34:30] you want to look in your Bible I'm not
[34:31] going to pull it up here but in Genesis
[34:33] 2 that God has changed now to Lord God
[34:40] Jehovah now has got something that's
[34:44] going to be expressed so that the eye
[34:47] can see
[34:48] see look I'm telling you this Genesis
[34:51] 1:26 man is so hidden it has to be known
[34:55] by revelation right you can't literally
[34:57] see this Genesis 1:26 man in that form
[35:01] you got to see it by revelation because
[35:05] remember if it's all the bride of Jesus
[35:07] Christ if it's the whole book of
[35:09] redemption you can't see that except by
[35:11] the I'm revelation but now when you go
[35:14] to the 2:7 man you're going to literally
[35:16] see Adam standing on the earth not all
[35:20] right you're going to see a form come
[35:24] over and then you're going to be able to
[35:26] see the animals were able to see Adam
[35:29] that all right amen so 30 times the word
[35:34] God was used now in Genesis 2 when God
[35:37] puts in 2:7 he says and the Lord God
[35:40] formed man the Lord God he picks up
[35:45] another even Scofield
[35:46] tells you right here in Scofield the
[35:50] primary meaning of the name Lord is the
[35:51] self-existent one then he comes over to
[35:54] be known as the self-existent one who
[35:56] reveals himself then you come on down
[35:58] further and he says Lord God which is
[36:00] Jehovah Elohim which is a father with
[36:04] his family somebody grab one of these
[36:06] and start spinning it okay there you go
[36:11] I'm going to put names on these and
[36:13] start throwing them at you pay attention
[36:18] let's go to number two these are from
[36:20] last week but I want to I want to kind
[36:22] of go over them again just to show where
[36:25] we're coming from now this is in
[36:26] questions and answers on Genesis 1953
[36:29] now God created man in his own image and
[36:30] on his own likeness
[36:31] what kind of man that he created a
[36:33] spirit man that's why this Genesis 1:26
[36:37] man has to be seen by the eye of faith
[36:41] by the eye of faith because it's all the
[36:44] believers and then a spirit man now if
[36:49] you'll notice but now remember when we
[36:50] say spirit man like I said last Sunday
[36:52] when we say spirit man we automatically
[36:55] come on people we automatically go to
[36:57] cash for the friendly go or some spook
[37:00] that's floating around you know or some
[37:02] sheet that don't we darling tell me what
[37:05] is that right
[37:05] when we say ghost we are my Holy Ghost
[37:12] doesn't look like Casper the Friendly
[37:13] Ghost
[37:14] my Holy Ghost is a man and then that's
[37:18] what this was a spirit man not a man
[37:21] that you couldn't see now this man had
[37:22] substance now if you'll notice after he
[37:27] had made all the creation and created a
[37:29] spirit man the close reading of this now
[37:31] to the one that asked the question will
[37:32] find that God give dominion of the
[37:35] cattle and the fish and everything to
[37:36] the man but in his making up there he
[37:39] made man in his own image to Lisa kind
[37:42] of lead the beasts of the field just
[37:43] like the Holy Spirit leads to believer
[37:45] today before God put Adam in human flesh
[37:48] Adam was all over he could go anywhere
[37:53] remember he wasn't just the God of Eden
[37:57] world North Pole South Pole Africa India
[38:02] of course we know at that time all the
[38:04] land mass was together but that's okay
[38:06] but anyway he had a lot of it was busy
[38:09] but you know what it didn't matter cause
[38:11] you wasn't tired didn't have a human
[38:14] body to deal with but he had a body and
[38:17] man that's the Alpha knee we're going to
[38:19] talk about that maybe a little bit later
[38:20] on down the road because remember when I
[38:23] told him it's morning sunny scoop when
[38:24] God in his theophany when God went into
[38:28] the Garden of Eden and when they fell
[38:30] there must have been so much substance
[38:32] to that man till he could kill a lamb
[38:37] rip the skins off of the lamb throw the
[38:41] skins in Adam and Eve and say here put
[38:43] these on right now that's not a that's
[38:45] not a cache for the friendly ghost poop
[38:47] that can you know know that man listen
[38:52] God always had substance
[38:55] he always has because what we are okay
[39:00] that all right we're man like you let
[39:05] the Holy Spirit leads a believer today
[39:07] because remember that Genesis 1:26 man
[39:10] is the whole experience if you don't
[39:12] know that yes that's where we're heading
[39:13] to that's the Holy Ghost that comes back
[39:15] in the believer a man at Genesis 1:26
[39:18] men never fail right that Genesis 1:26
[39:23] men never had a bad thought that Genesis
[39:25] 1:26 man never preached terror never had
[39:30] a headache never had a heart rate
[39:32] because you know what when people in
[39:34] that six dimension which has that are
[39:36] going to walk back into this Dominion
[39:38] into this dimension and pick up that
[39:40] body they're not going to be arms
[39:42] missing there's not going to be and
[39:44] listen I've always told you you talk
[39:46] about the OP Anish we ought listen we
[39:49] are human we always think about the
[39:50] oppening as really is like a sheet in
[39:53] the wind but I'll promise you one thing
[39:57] that's the offering of Paul was so much
[40:00] alive till when they laid him on that
[40:03] chopping block and they cut his human
[40:05] head off when he stepped into that six
[40:08] dimension he did not have to pick his
[40:10] head
[40:11] up off of the ground and put it back on
[40:13] his body no no he just shed this one and
[40:16] walking stepped right over and he was
[40:19] just a solid as he was when he was in
[40:22] other of them in this dimension that's
[40:24] our problem we think of a theophany or
[40:26] something as a lesser or something no no
[40:29] no it's the greater part of us if we're
[40:32] born again that's what's going to carry
[40:33] us into a body change our human spirit
[40:37] will never carry us into a body change
[40:39] I said spirit I didn't say so that all
[40:47] right
[40:47] so this substance of this Genesis 1:26
[40:50] man to me is is this solid is any of
[40:55] this all right
[40:56] hey my knees not hurt how are you thank
[40:58] God he was in other words Adam the first
[41:01] man in lower creation of God the first
[41:03] creation was God himself boy the
[41:06] theologians they went through their
[41:07] Bibles they're looking for this I guess
[41:08] then out of God comes the logos which
[41:11] was the son of God what the creator what
[41:14] the one that could speak now remember
[41:19] the Bible says that Jesus Christ was the
[41:21] creator and man is that right John 1
[41:26] Colossians 1 I think somebody read it on
[41:29] the day brother Dell
[41:30] somebody read it the other day but that
[41:32] was the son that was a crappy knew he
[41:34] was a creator then out of the logos
[41:38] which was the word because remember
[41:40] everything was created by what the Word
[41:42] of God in the beginning was the word and
[41:44] word was with god and the word was god
[41:46] and the word was made flesh
[41:49] oh that's talking about Jesus I thought
[41:55] we were errors and joint-heirs Romans 8
[41:59] said what he gets we get and the word
[42:03] was made flesh and dwelt among us out of
[42:05] the low God came forth the man now you
[42:10] got Adam now standing on the earth let's
[42:14] go to number three not in flesh body yet
[42:19] hang on
[42:19] we're not flesh body we're still in the
[42:21] Genesis 1:26 man all right go down
[42:24] guys come to man and then God took that
[42:26] and put that into flesh cold out look at
[42:30] that all right all right hey I tell you
[42:38] what take your fingers and do like this
[42:39] and just play like you got one now
[42:45] Isaiah 9:6 we just won't read it but he
[42:47] was to be the everlasting father the
[42:48] mighty God this is the Messiah 1961 when
[42:52] God made man in Genesis 1:26 now
[42:54] remember he did not make all mankind
[42:58] that Genesis 1:26 man is not all mankind
[43:02] that is not Adolf Hitler that is not
[43:05] your neighbor unless he's born again
[43:06] that is not anyone except the children
[43:10] of Almighty God because these people
[43:12] sure man general man was made in the
[43:15] image of God we all got hands feet legs
[43:17] arms intelligence and all that but
[43:20] remember it's a fall Satan twisted it
[43:23] right Satan didn't twist to Genesis 1:26
[43:26] man
[43:27] listen to Genesis 1:26 man never was
[43:29] fooled the day in his life remember Adam
[43:32] was not fooled Adam knew what he was
[43:35] doing why cuz Gaddy intelligent some God
[43:38] right and it's not written in black and
[43:42] white but I believe he knew the plan of
[43:43] God why would he hold something if he
[43:47] could control all of this world he knew
[43:53] what was going on I don't believe he was
[43:56] book he was blinded remember brother
[44:01] Brown says both eyes open when he walked
[44:02] into the fall he had both eyes open
[44:04] he knew he was selling the whole human
[44:06] race out why he knew the plan I believe
[44:09] he did but we'll get to that in a minute
[44:12] it shows that God made man to be a god
[44:17] to begin with man was made to be a God a
[44:20] lesser God he was made in the image and
[44:22] likeness of God now what he had hands
[44:25] like God yet feet like God eyes ears and
[44:32] intelligence like God now I'm talking
[44:34] like this Genesis 1.6 man because Paul
[44:37] tells us if
[44:38] we are born again we have the mind of
[44:40] Christ we're supposed to and the
[44:44] intelligence like God his whole fiber
[44:48] because he was a son of God cuz remember
[44:50] Adam didn't have a mom and daddy just
[44:52] nature to fall back to then alright he
[44:55] didn't have a mom and daddy nature to
[44:57] fall back to he comes straight from God
[45:00] and then he comes straight from the
[45:02] Almighty when he looks at God he said
[45:04] you're my daddy in good old southern
[45:07] English
[45:08] you're my dad you're my daddy he knew
[45:11] who his daddy was hey man because he was
[45:17] the son of God and then Jesus referred
[45:20] to him as God that's what he's talking
[45:21] about he's talking about when they told
[45:23] Jesus said you'd be a man making
[45:25] yourself God he said you're your Bible
[45:28] the Old Testament the Scrolls you're
[45:30] supposed to know he referred by said you
[45:33] say your gods who the word comes to what
[45:36] was he telling them I'm God because I am
[45:40] the word amen same way with you and I
[45:46] all we throw all this back to this great
[45:49] one called Jesus and that's what he's
[45:51] the greatest man ever walked on the face
[45:53] of the earth but he has given us part of
[45:58] himself for us to manifest what on earth
[46:03] God for us to manifest God on the face
[46:07] of the earth but remember you've got to
[46:10] come from God right like God if you come
[46:14] from the devil you act like the devil
[46:17] that's just plain as it can be I don't
[46:20] look like brother Luis because brother
[46:22] Lu is mom and daddy was not my mom and
[46:24] dad right brother we stole all I mean
[46:27] why because I have the DNA of who
[46:29] brought me here he has the DNA of who
[46:31] brought him here amen
[46:32] all right let's go to the next one let's
[46:34] go to Genesis 2:7 let's get this man in
[46:36] human flesh the Lord God formed man
[46:39] formed man out of the dust of the ground
[46:44] and breathed into his nostrils the
[46:48] breath of life and he became a living
[46:50] soul so he takes that one
[46:52] 26 men and he puts him and I'll read it
[46:55] here in a minute he puts him into a
[46:57] flesh body okay all right
[47:02] now let's go to the next quote because
[47:05] it was one from last time and then I
[47:06] think this is where we'll start a new
[47:08] afresh this is a continuation of the
[47:11] questions and answers in 1953 on Genesis
[47:14] now if a man was made something like
[47:16] that little sacred light yonder or
[47:17] something like that it could not be seen
[47:19] no watch because you'll see brother
[47:21] branham he'll say that here's this
[47:23] sacred light talks about God here's this
[47:27] sacred light will now remember if he was
[47:32] just a light
[47:33] then you and I when we were created in
[47:36] His image we would just be like a man he
[47:39] was hidden inside that light
[47:42] I thought the property God told us that
[47:44] that halo in the picture with Jesus
[47:46] Christ Himself the problem with us is we
[47:49] don't have enough revelation to be able
[47:51] to see this actually that was a man if
[47:55] the children of Israel had a had a
[47:58] personal revelation of God they would
[48:01] have looked in that cloud by day in a
[48:03] pillar of fire by night and they would
[48:04] have seen a man God never was anything
[48:08] but a man he's the only man that's why
[48:12] we can stand and say I am made in the
[48:14] image of that man a man so brother
[48:19] branham's explaining here see now if a
[48:21] man was something like that little
[48:22] sacred lot younger or something like
[48:24] that it could not be seen which is the
[48:26] spiritual being he manufactured her
[48:28] unfolding himself a little more to make
[48:31] a trinity old brother Brandon bless your
[48:33] heart now you know he didn't mean that
[48:36] he means trying and he you know that
[48:38] brother I'm never need believes in the
[48:41] Trinity of himself by Father Son and
[48:44] Holy Spirit and here was God unfolded
[48:47] himself now down in to let us make man
[48:50] Genesis 1:26 which was his son and
[48:54] offspring from him man in our own image
[48:58] he was a supernatural being a man
[49:03] because remember love what is that
[49:06] saying natural we're all natural you got
[49:10] God in you your supernatural your
[49:13] feeling natural being but when you put a
[49:16] little God in there a little bit of
[49:17] light of that light he's talking about
[49:19] you become a supernatural being and then
[49:22] and let him have dominion over the
[49:25] cattle of the field so forth and I've
[49:26] scrolled all the way up now the man led
[49:29] the man led the cattle and everything
[49:32] just like the Holy Spirit leads a real
[49:33] true believer today now watch this we
[49:36] register Sunday but did you get this the
[49:39] voice of God out there
[49:41] he stops something tells him he's not
[49:44] saying it right the voice of man rather
[49:48] right what'd he do he brings it to where
[49:51] we know God's a creator we know God can
[49:53] speak but he's bringing it now and
[49:56] letting the man do the speaking you know
[49:58] what he's doing now he's letting the man
[50:00] do the speaking watch the voice of man
[50:03] rather would speak and say call the
[50:06] cattle this way call the sheep over to
[50:08] this pasture garrison Zak would like
[50:12] that if that would happen all the time
[50:14] call the cattle over here and you
[50:16] wouldn't have to go rustle them up
[50:17] wouldn't have to go find them same way
[50:21] with my bees I wouldn't have to crawl 15
[50:22] foot up in a tree to get a beehive out
[50:24] if they do what they're supposed to do
[50:26] but this was before the fall and then
[50:30] but we're heading back to that condition
[50:31] because when we go back to an eating
[50:33] condition we're still going to we're
[50:35] going to be over nature come on people
[50:38] we're going to be over nature just like
[50:39] Adam was listen Redemption is not
[50:43] replacement if this is before the fall
[50:46] that's what we're going back to why is
[50:50] the lion going to lay down with the lamb
[50:52] all just because no it's because you're
[50:54] there right because you're there in what
[50:57] a pre fallen condition you had went back
[51:00] over and above the fall and you're back
[51:03] into the condition where they're being
[51:05] led by you because the problem with us
[51:07] is remember when Adam fell kita was
[51:15] a pet but after the fall Adam became
[51:20] food for cheetah a man why because you
[51:32] know what the animal did now the animal
[51:33] doesn't talk the Ottoman doesn't have a
[51:35] soul but the animal looked back and said
[51:36] you did this to us
[51:38] we're mad at you you say put in the
[51:42] scripture Roman they said the whole
[51:43] creation is what groaning and travailing
[51:47] growling growling at me and you to get
[51:52] mad because if we ever get back to the
[51:53] rifle condition everything behind us is
[51:56] going to be right hey man everything
[51:58] behind us go listen we're at the highest
[52:00] chain we're right there with God and we
[52:03] fell from that and the whole world
[52:07] groaning and travailing what please do
[52:11] something to get us back to this rifle
[52:13] condition we I want to eat each other
[52:15] anymore the lion will lay down with the
[52:21] lamb they'll eat grass we'll have to eat
[52:24] meat I don't know what then big things
[52:26] where they're going to go but I don't
[52:27] matter call the fish to the water he had
[52:32] Dominion everything obeyed him now but
[52:36] then there was no man to till the soil
[52:37] Genesis to no man to till the soil and
[52:40] then God formed man Genesis 2:7 out of
[52:42] the dust of the earth now we follow it
[52:44] he formed man out of the dust of the
[52:46] earth and put their supernatural spirit
[52:48] everybody got that they got one of these
[52:53] everybody and start spending it hey go
[52:55] red layer start spending that saying
[52:57] judge the spin-spin-spin same thing I'll
[52:59] promise you because you know what if you
[53:00] fall asleep we need to make them where
[53:03] they go but if you'll hold on to that
[53:08] thing man I mean you keep you wait he
[53:11] says that or take your knife and put it
[53:12] right here and just hold it
[53:18] we pray for the sick we do stick in mind
[53:22] and sick and body yeah Thank You Louise
[53:28] we'll let you use okay what a figure
[53:33] brother Padgett we're just human people
[53:35] we're just human and man but we're
[53:39] heading back to something though because
[53:40] he put a former solid dusty earth he put
[53:43] that supernatural spirit now he was
[53:45] laying there I couldn't have many
[53:46] pictures of it I can see Adam standing
[53:48] what a prophet of God go right back in
[53:49] the Garden of Eden
[53:51] hey if Moses can go back there so clear
[53:53] brother Adam how do you know that Eve
[53:57] was the most beautiful woman in the
[53:59] world blunt headed but alive Adams hair
[54:02] was shoulder length listen when he was
[54:05] explaining these things it's just like
[54:07] that he was there and he was because
[54:10] remember when the Prophet goes up he can
[54:12] see as far this way as he came this way
[54:14] amen he said no profit in seeing in the
[54:17] future Moses was a prophet he saw in the
[54:20] past and wrote five books of the Bible
[54:21] and then all right so I can see Adam
[54:24] standing there listen let's take this
[54:26] way and see him standing like a tree god
[54:29] it made him he was dead as he could be
[54:31] his toes like the roots sticking in the
[54:33] ground and God said let there be and
[54:35] breathed the breath of life into him and
[54:38] he jumped came to himself see he was
[54:41] breathed the breath of life into him he
[54:43] became a living soul now and he began to
[54:46] move on move on what he put man in
[54:49] humans what amen
[54:52] he went from he didn't take a
[54:55] supernatural big being and make him
[54:57] lower he just took that supernatural
[55:00] being and put it in something called
[55:01] flesh and then we see it as a lower form
[55:05] because we're on this side fall because
[55:08] remember Genesis 2:7 even when he put
[55:10] man into human flesh it was before the
[55:13] fall and then that's what so that's
[55:16] what's so wonderfully Adam and Eve
[55:18] walked around and we'll read it in a
[55:20] minute they walked around naked for
[55:21] probably hundreds of thousands of years
[55:22] in human flashes and didn't bother why
[55:24] they had a Holy Ghost veil cuz remember
[55:29] let me tell you something
[55:32] we God told those animals to multiply in
[55:35] the earth what is that
[55:36] procreation they were watching the
[55:40] animals all the time
[55:42] procreating you understand what I mean
[55:44] without being graphic they knew listen
[55:48] all they had to do is look at their self
[55:50] and look at the animal let's just be
[55:51] that way okay
[55:52] they knew they were made the same way
[55:54] they were just in the highest form and
[55:56] they had a soul to be able to control
[55:58] that is that Alright she'll be able to
[56:02] control that they had a Holy Ghost veil
[56:05] over their eyes property God tells us
[56:07] then after that the Holy Ghost well was
[56:09] lifted remember hey man what's the truth
[56:12] in him he breathed the breath of life
[56:16] into him and he became a lesser man no I
[56:18] didn't become lesser man he was still
[56:19] God he was still God the earth amen
[56:21] reading the breath of life and he began
[56:23] to leave himself now all right now let's
[56:25] go to Genesis to verse 16 now here on
[56:33] mother's day we're going to we're going
[56:35] to bring whatever this Genesis 1:26 man
[56:37] now we read it last Sunday we read it
[56:39] again but I want you to see something
[56:41] about this and the Lord God Lord God the
[56:47] Lord God Jehovah with a family he he was
[56:50] beginning to be where you could see
[56:52] something and then there's a good book
[56:56] to read called oneness with God
[56:57] I've told you many times before read
[57:00] that book brother Brownwood oneness with
[57:01] God I believe it's 1962 or 63 he said
[57:04] true 1 this was Adam and even and Adam
[57:07] and even God in the garden was true 1
[57:08] this one hour now we're looking at at
[57:10] the scene we would see God standing here
[57:12] and Adam and Eve would say there's three
[57:13] and that kind of what man season now but
[57:19] when God sees it it's one when he saw
[57:22] brother Brown said true one this was
[57:24] Adam and Eve and God in the Garden of
[57:27] Eden that's true oneness why because
[57:29] that was an extension of God and what
[57:31] was what was Eve he was a firmament or
[57:33] an extension of item we'll read it right
[57:36] here but the tree of the knowledge of
[57:37] good and evil now every tree you can eat
[57:39] up and we're not going to get into
[57:41] Whiteman's the garden the lord of mercy
[57:42] else you know what happened in the
[57:43] garden
[57:43] but at the tree of knowledge of good and
[57:45] evil thou shalt not eat for in the day
[57:47] though neither stare of del dot and the
[57:50] Lord God said it is not good that man
[57:53] should be alone I will milk make him and
[57:57] help me not a helpmate to help me is
[58:00] this right ok a help meet for him see
[58:04] that doesn't say mate man like brother
[58:08] Dale said you can be a - men can be a
[58:09] mate but to be a helpmeet it was Adam
[58:13] and Eve a man male and female and out of
[58:16] the ground the Lord God formed every
[58:18] beast of the field missus beast and mr.
[58:21] beef mr. horse and mrs. horse mr.
[58:24] chicken and mrs. chicken hey man welcome
[58:26] first the chicken of the egg to check
[58:28] head ok afterward came the eggs crazy
[58:41] people and out of the ground the Lord
[58:43] God formed every beast of the field
[58:44] every follow the air and brought them
[58:47] under Adam to see what he would call
[58:49] them and whatsoever Adam called never
[58:51] live whatsoever he would call them
[58:53] called every living creature that was
[58:56] the name like I said last Sunday I had
[58:58] him is sitting there and here comes by
[59:01] this thing that's grey and got a big
[59:03] trunk it looked like a air hose on the
[59:05] front of his face and he's huge and Adam
[59:08] says that is an elephant and God didn't
[59:13] go Adam that does not look like an
[59:17] elephant no God was standing there right
[59:19] beside Adam and he said that's exactly
[59:22] what I was thinking to me that's a
[59:27] revelation so that's the way we're
[59:29] supposed to be led now right a man goes
[59:33] listen God never questioned Adam before
[59:35] the fall
[59:36] he couldn't question Adam before the
[59:38] fall he couldn't he'd be questioning
[59:42] himself right God has never questioned
[59:45] himself why did you do that
[59:47] never we do it all the time but we're on
[59:52] this side of all remember we got to get
[59:54] back on that side of the ball
[59:56] that was a real fall with it it was when
[59:59] it's called the fall a minute it was a
[1:00:01] fall and Adam gave names to all the
[1:00:03] cattle and to the fowl of the air and to
[1:00:06] every beast of the field but for Adam
[1:00:07] that was not found and help meet for him
[1:00:10] and the Lord God caused a deep sleep to
[1:00:14] fall upon Adam he slept he took one of
[1:00:18] his ribs close up the flesh instead
[1:00:20] thereof now like what Jewell Forney said
[1:00:25] he said you know he said you come to
[1:00:27] Adam he took Eve out of Adam and closed
[1:00:30] the side back up she couldn't get back
[1:00:32] in but when the second Adam went to
[1:00:35] Calvary and man speared his side and he
[1:00:39] said Thomas stick your hand
[1:00:41] he left the gap open so that we could
[1:00:43] get back in Christ a man does that God
[1:00:47] knew the first Adam was going to fall
[1:00:48] the second item will not fall that's why
[1:00:50] we can get back into him that all right
[1:00:53] and closed up the flesh instead thereof
[1:00:57] and the rib which the Lord God had taken
[1:00:59] from man made he a woman and brought her
[1:01:02] unto the man now like what Lewis said
[1:01:05] broader and said here this is me made
[1:01:09] manifest in another form Adam said you
[1:01:12] are me made manifest in another form
[1:01:16] God said yep that's you in another form
[1:01:19] because listen folks and I've told I
[1:01:21] told miss Martin I'm gonna tell you
[1:01:22] again those in sun-tzu class going laugh
[1:01:26] as much as you can try to be this part
[1:01:33] right here in this human flesh you can't
[1:01:36] be left doesn't matter like I was
[1:01:42] telling them before I was delivering
[1:01:44] mail the other day and I was put a mail
[1:01:45] in the box and I turned to look and it
[1:01:47] was some good-looking woman pulled up
[1:01:48] right beside of me blocking the lane she
[1:01:52] rolled down a window she looked at me
[1:01:53] she said what are you doing after work
[1:01:54] and I about lost my cookies I told them
[1:02:00] I about strip my gears and ruined an
[1:02:03] engine it was my wife
[1:02:08] y'all was thinking Jeannie Jeannie was
[1:02:11] about to go wise in the world
[1:02:13] it was June she had pulled up right
[1:02:15] beside min left what you know what that
[1:02:16] just thrilled my heart but you know what
[1:02:19] I was thinking when I left I thought God
[1:02:20] if that can be so close how about me and
[1:02:23] you can see that's figlio love the love
[1:02:29] we're talking about if God is so far
[1:02:31] above that you think you love your wife
[1:02:33] or your husband sees me but see Jun and
[1:02:35] I could never be as much it and we have
[1:02:36] ups and downs just like everybody we
[1:02:38] sure enjoy each other we really did this
[1:02:40] is not bone of my bone and flesh of my
[1:02:42] flesh now I can't literally say that
[1:02:44] about her
[1:02:44] she was formed from Gina and Jackie
[1:02:48] Thomas and I was formed from Samuel and
[1:02:51] Peggy Dale our DNA will never match
[1:02:55] flesh to bone right but now Adam Adam
[1:03:02] and Eve were literally he could take a
[1:03:06] DNA sample anywhere on Eve and it would
[1:03:09] match exactly to that man standing right
[1:03:12] there hey man so he said yes well this
[1:03:15] is now bone of my bone and flesh of my
[1:03:19] flesh she shall be called woman because
[1:03:21] she was taken out of man now remember
[1:03:24] but remember we'll read it in a minute
[1:03:26] her name was Adam Adam gave her the name
[1:03:31] Eve after the fall that all right but
[1:03:36] her name was Adam like I said when God
[1:03:39] when Adam and Eve walked up the garden
[1:03:40] that was one person and he thought you
[1:03:45] know God is so patient God is so patient
[1:03:51] because he's waiting on that to happen
[1:03:53] again he's waiting on that to happen
[1:03:56] again to where that he can walk up in
[1:03:59] front of his bride and say that is me in
[1:04:02] another form they are literally when we
[1:04:05] get a change of the body folks we will
[1:04:07] be literally bone of his bone and flesh
[1:04:10] of his flesh
[1:04:11] a man sold us all we are gone waiting
[1:04:17] the change of the body what I was saying
[1:04:20] the other day if we can get death
[1:04:21] destroyed here that will bring that
[1:04:23] sixth dimension here the reason they
[1:04:25] can't come here why would they want to
[1:04:27] come back into death brother Branham
[1:04:30] standing on the curtain of time he looks
[1:04:31] back he says I have to go back there
[1:04:32] right why because that was death on that
[1:04:35] side and it was life on this side
[1:04:37] they're going to stay over here until we
[1:04:40] destroy death on this side realize that
[1:04:43] we are bone of his bone and flesh of his
[1:04:46] flesh and we have a name I call you
[1:04:52] breath and then we all are different
[1:04:56] names but one name brought therefore
[1:04:59] shall a man leave his father and mother
[1:05:01] and cleave not leave they read it leave
[1:05:07] now cleave and I didn't I said just
[1:05:11] that's it is look it didn't say man
[1:05:13] shall leave his wife and cleave to his
[1:05:15] mother and father we got only so many
[1:05:18] going back home now but it says leave
[1:05:20] your father mother and cleave unto your
[1:05:24] wife and they shall be one flesh a man
[1:05:27] and they were both naked and the man and
[1:05:29] wife and we're not ashamed why there was
[1:05:31] the Holy Ghost fell there
[1:05:33] there was no lust involved it was all
[1:05:36] controlled by God a man that all right
[1:05:39] without being so so graphic but
[1:05:43] literally Adam and Eve was one person
[1:05:49] when we get when we get back above that
[1:05:52] fallen condition we're going to be one
[1:05:54] person a man one person but the reason
[1:06:00] that we're doing in the shape we're in
[1:06:02] now we know that is because I told them
[1:06:04] in the same school class you'll not if
[1:06:06] you see this you're going to see
[1:06:08] Redemption to its highest form brother
[1:06:13] Brown said what hold that word
[1:06:14] redemption Redeemer he can be all these
[1:06:19] different things but if he doesn't
[1:06:21] redeem me I'm in trouble
[1:06:23] and then he's my Redeemer he
[1:06:26] one that came down here through all this
[1:06:27] mess went through all this mess took on
[1:06:31] my sin just like Adam took on Eve sin
[1:06:34] done alright
[1:06:37] but Adam could not return into the
[1:06:42] believer because Adam was a mortal man
[1:06:46] sure he had the Spirit of God sure he
[1:06:49] was the son of God the Bible called him
[1:06:50] a son of God and man he's a son of God
[1:06:54] he wasn't he didn't fall in his soul
[1:06:58] hello somebody never he wouldn't be a
[1:07:02] son of God and if I'm not mistaken if
[1:07:06] you'll go over and look at Luke I
[1:07:07] believe that's a capital S for those of
[1:07:10] you that come to church here you know
[1:07:11] what that means
[1:07:12] alright because look the Bible the Bible
[1:07:15] has capital letters sometimes like when
[1:07:17] it shouldn't be like that but that means
[1:07:21] something that gives it a meaning when
[1:07:23] it's when it's a different when it's a
[1:07:25] lowercase or an uppercase Y then we're
[1:07:27] not gonna get into that or we'll never
[1:07:28] be finished all right so let's go to
[1:07:30] number five let's read this now look
[1:07:33] then god taken from his side a piece of
[1:07:36] him a rib and made a woman now where did
[1:07:39] he get the spirit woman the spirit come
[1:07:42] a woman see when he Genesis 1:26 he is a
[1:07:45] let us make man in our own image and
[1:07:47] after our own likeness created he them
[1:07:49] man male and female and he made the
[1:07:52] burly spirit for the man he made the
[1:07:53] tender little delicate feminine spirit
[1:07:54] for the woman now remember let's go back
[1:07:56] to something that I didn't that I didn't
[1:07:58] cover last Sunday the Bible tells us in
[1:08:01] Genesis 1 before they were put into
[1:08:03] human flesh see this is when go back to
[1:08:05] our carnal mind that we have to be in
[1:08:07] flesh bodies to procreate Genesis 1:26
[1:08:12] man was told to multiply and replenish
[1:08:14] the earth before they were put in a
[1:08:16] flesh body
[1:08:17] why that's a supernatural spoken seed
[1:08:20] not a literal man seed it is one man
[1:08:24] seed the seed Word of God that says let
[1:08:27] there be
[1:08:27] let there be he didn't have to go to a
[1:08:30] manufacturing plant and get his
[1:08:32] chemicals he just said let there be and
[1:08:35] then same way with you and I
[1:08:39] if you're born again so he knew he was
[1:08:43] going to have some women so we just made
[1:08:46] your spirit right there how simpler
[1:08:47] laughs he just made their spirit the
[1:08:50] Bible said he would in 1 Genesis 1:26 he
[1:08:53] created him man in a pre figure male and
[1:08:55] female amen
[1:08:56] now see we get a pervert in mind like
[1:08:59] male and female and get all this
[1:09:01] feelings and and no remember that
[1:09:06] Genesis 1:26 man has all the
[1:09:09] characteristics of God not of human
[1:09:13] mortal man right remember it has to stay
[1:09:16] supernatural okay that's why that we're
[1:09:20] going to read in just a minute when
[1:09:21] brother Brown said the man fell when he
[1:09:22] was put into the flesh because what in
[1:09:25] listed the Genesis 1:26 man he can make
[1:09:28] a billion men and a billion women and
[1:09:34] not have one problem no divorce no I'm
[1:09:40] jealous of this one no no sexual
[1:09:46] relation no clear mind clear body clear
[1:09:51] spirit Eve
[1:09:54] let there be even let there be because
[1:09:57] we're going to read in just a minute how
[1:09:58] Adam we may not get to it how Adam lost
[1:10:01] the ability to bring us the way we
[1:10:04] should have come the spoken word is
[1:10:06] original seed and that the spoken word
[1:10:10] is the original seed not man seed man
[1:10:13] seed will kill you always that's why God
[1:10:20] created his own seed and his own egg and
[1:10:25] put it in an incubator hey man so he
[1:10:29] knew he was going to have some women the
[1:10:30] Bible said he would Genesis 1.6 he
[1:10:32] created him man in a pre figure male and
[1:10:35] female in a pre figure he knew he was
[1:10:38] going to separate them
[1:10:39] he's God like I tell in Louise
[1:10:46] I'm gonna preach a sermon not too long
[1:10:48] from now maybe called
[1:10:50] remember they'll phrase there's where
[1:10:52] there's a will there's a way
[1:10:55] or there's a will there's a way
[1:11:00] you're now you are now recipients of the
[1:11:04] will that God wrote before the
[1:11:06] foundation of the world and the family
[1:11:10] is here today all gathered because daddy
[1:11:12] died come on so my daddy died the
[1:11:17] testator had to die I've never heard any
[1:11:19] by reading the will unless you get all
[1:11:20] kooky about it you never read a will
[1:11:22] until what somebody did somebody had to
[1:11:25] die and then look on Sunday morning and
[1:11:27] Sunday afternoon and Wednesday you have
[1:11:30] the well written in the book and it's
[1:11:34] being given to you and he sat there
[1:11:38] before the foundation of the world and
[1:11:40] he wrote the will 66 chapters of a will
[1:11:47] he wrote maybe you'll stay awake for
[1:11:52] that one if I fall oh sorry mom get me
[1:12:00] sister
[1:12:03] that's perfectly fine perfectly fine I
[1:12:08] don't bother me a bit
[1:12:09] that's good good to see soon as mom
[1:12:10] buddy yes you look just like your mama
[1:12:12] doesn't she that Susan's mom with y'all
[1:12:14] didn't know that in a prefiguring he
[1:12:16] made the woman in the man before they
[1:12:18] was ever formed I was a dust of the
[1:12:20] earth like Rosa was talking about for
[1:12:23] knowledge you know you the for knowledge
[1:12:25] and you look at predestination that's
[1:12:27] why we hammered so much predestination
[1:12:29] has to look at foreknowledge first the
[1:12:32] foreknowledge of God knew what the
[1:12:34] predestinate that's why he could write
[1:12:37] this before the foundation of the world
[1:12:38] he knew what you would choose he knew
[1:12:42] what Abraham would choose he knew that
[1:12:44] would be an Isaac a Joseph a Jacob a
[1:12:46] William Branham a Martin Luther and he
[1:12:49] what he put them everyone in a will how
[1:12:53] can we lose we can't lose we just can't
[1:12:57] we're already in the will
[1:12:59] and we get it read to us every Sunday
[1:13:01] and every Wednesday and every time we
[1:13:02] might play and then cool that and then
[1:13:06] God made the man look now what you got
[1:13:10] to really read this and God made the man
[1:13:13] not in his own image brother Adam the
[1:13:16] Bible said God was created us in His
[1:13:19] image what's he talking about
[1:13:20] this bodies this body is not remember
[1:13:29] there's a perfect wheel and then there
[1:13:32] was a wheel that was written after the
[1:13:33] fall permissive will a man that was a
[1:13:38] sub will that's written but the sub
[1:13:40] wheel is not greater than the wheel the
[1:13:42] sub wheel was written as as what
[1:13:44] permissive will then we're going to go
[1:13:46] back to the will will look talked about
[1:13:48] later and when God made the man not in
[1:13:50] his own image this body is not in the
[1:13:53] image of God this body is in the image
[1:13:55] of beasts somebody asks question one
[1:13:58] times you why are we now formed the way
[1:14:02] we are with our body parts the way we
[1:14:03] are creative evolution folks but you
[1:14:09] look at a rabbit or a horse or in and
[1:14:13] you see them doing the procreation thing
[1:14:15] and that's everything is fine right
[1:14:17] right see it all the time but now you
[1:14:20] take somebody with a soul that's got a
[1:14:23] conscience that's got a self will that's
[1:14:28] my brother and will not get to it today
[1:14:30] for them will trying to stay at the hour
[1:14:32] here but woman remember was different
[1:14:36] from animal she had a soul she could
[1:14:38] choose she could do it anytime she
[1:14:39] wanted to hey man I'm going to read that
[1:14:42] and then we're going to have to stop
[1:14:43] again cuz I want to get into to the I'm
[1:14:49] gonna get Cain and Abel born in here in
[1:14:51] a month or so get them here on it get
[1:14:55] them here on the earth okay Callay with
[1:14:58] something happen between them that's
[1:14:59] really interesting that you should know
[1:15:01] and it actually matches with the seals
[1:15:03] you see the spit Nixon remember every
[1:15:06] spirit come out of Genesis right amen
[1:15:08] every spirit all those wild wild horse
[1:15:11] red horse black horse all the
[1:15:13] riders came out of Genesis a man they
[1:15:16] weren't just where John saw him what
[1:15:17] John was the Prophet John was what taken
[1:15:20] up so he could see prophetic this way
[1:15:25] this way this way in this way so he saw
[1:15:27] those seals they didn't just all of a
[1:15:28] sudden the horse rider jump up in the
[1:15:30] end time and start riding
[1:15:31] now that spirit was here because the
[1:15:34] devil was here before you were here in
[1:15:36] this part not the Genesis 1:26 man but
[1:15:39] in this part you got it cuz remember the
[1:15:42] Genesis 1:26 men never had a beginning
[1:15:44] or never had an end ok Staton had a
[1:15:47] beginning and he's gonna have an end
[1:15:53] this body is in the image of beasts
[1:15:55] alright hold on let's see right here
[1:15:58] we're gonna okay go to the number 6 and
[1:16:02] then we'll stop right here and then I'm
[1:16:03] gonna read something on marriage and
[1:16:04] divorce and then oh don't run out the
[1:16:06] door don't run out the door I'm going to
[1:16:10] read something the Prophet said about
[1:16:11] marriage and divorce we're not gonna get
[1:16:12] into marriage and divorce okay so don't
[1:16:14] go out the door alright this part you
[1:16:18] can sleep maybe but don't go out the
[1:16:21] door with you alright Joseph father 1963
[1:16:25] now when man was made in the image of
[1:16:28] God he did not fall and let me tell you
[1:16:32] he could not fall Jessen go back people
[1:16:36] that one is inside of you never fell
[1:16:40] never what's our problem it's the flu
[1:16:53] where's the problem on this side the man
[1:16:57] when man was made in the image of God he
[1:16:59] did not fall when he was made in the
[1:17:02] image of man he fell man is this man
[1:17:06] what the higher form of creation just
[1:17:08] like I said why do we have the body
[1:17:09] parts we have well look look at creative
[1:17:13] evolution you come up even to the
[1:17:14] monkeys which we know is close to us but
[1:17:16] remember the missing link
[1:17:18] kids in school we always wondered about
[1:17:19] that man always wondered about that
[1:17:21] missing link if they'd read Genesis
[1:17:23] they'd have found a missing
[1:17:25] because that beach could fall back into
[1:17:28] the animal race and he could fall up
[1:17:30] into the human right that all right and
[1:17:32] he was probably not as hairy and he
[1:17:35] probably was not as stooped over as a
[1:17:36] chimpanzee listen Darwin wasn't far off
[1:17:41] but he was so far off he was he was you
[1:17:44] know he didn't believe that you know
[1:17:46] that God didn't in this that we just you
[1:17:47] know evolved from this but brother Bram
[1:17:49] said I don't believe in that kind of
[1:17:51] evolution he said I believe in creative
[1:17:52] evolution well that's why the beast had
[1:17:54] to be put there then me and you were put
[1:17:57] here or Adam and Eve were put here right
[1:18:00] there's a link missing link why is the
[1:18:04] link the link links us back to the
[1:18:06] animal but God did away with that whole
[1:18:09] length he did away with measured beasts
[1:18:11] mittens beats and all children beasts oh
[1:18:14] you don't believe that well if he
[1:18:17] created a dog and a female dog of the
[1:18:20] male dog he had to create a female beast
[1:18:21] in the male beef okay so that was a lot
[1:18:23] of little beasty people running around
[1:18:25] but they look kind of like humans
[1:18:26] because they weren't in harry maybe
[1:18:28] remember brother i'm city was a little
[1:18:30] bit bigger but it's just something that
[1:18:33] we we get in our mind and we get stuck
[1:18:35] on something and we can't get off of it
[1:18:38] but look when he was made in the image
[1:18:41] of beast that's why we look like we do
[1:18:44] cuz remember brother brown said when we
[1:18:46] go back to the when we go back past the
[1:18:50] following other side of the fall there's
[1:18:52] nothing to be in babies born that's not
[1:18:54] going to be any any desire any lust and
[1:18:57] all that goes away why because this is
[1:18:59] where that comes that this is a
[1:19:00] manifestation this manifest everything
[1:19:04] right hey I hope you don't know that
[1:19:09] tell me how old enough to understand
[1:19:10] this when he was my sister when is
[1:19:14] somebody going he slept through sex
[1:19:18] education class just like he's left
[1:19:19] through this one when he was made in the
[1:19:21] image of Beast
[1:19:22] daddy got on this subject one time and
[1:19:24] we went outside and everybody's like man
[1:19:26] we got a sex education course today but
[1:19:30] listen it's but remember you've got to
[1:19:32] remember though on this side of the fall
[1:19:34] it's not the Bible says the beds
[1:19:36] undefiled and this is way we're supposed
[1:19:38] to do it so let's don't get so much on
[1:19:40] this side to where we know we're here
[1:19:44] this is what we were put here to do on
[1:19:47] this side of the fall but you know what
[1:19:49] we're going to do we're going to prove
[1:19:50] through this that God is going to take
[1:19:53] us back up to where Adam and Eve was
[1:19:56] before the ball hey man the very thing
[1:20:00] that Satan said I'm gonna get you when
[1:20:03] you know what he was going when he puts
[1:20:06] them in human flesh that's when I mos
[1:20:09] def in he said because I can see that
[1:20:11] beast he can't be controlled on one side
[1:20:14] of the other he said I can control and
[1:20:16] then mr. beef just walks over and he
[1:20:18] goes if he ain't got no kids not kids
[1:20:25] you don't have no kids God told you to
[1:20:28] multiply and replenish the earth would
[1:20:31] you have no children where's your kids
[1:20:34] he sold her brother Ram city's shoulder
[1:20:37] sold of his program she didn't keep
[1:20:40] God's program to where they were going
[1:20:41] to be spoken word children she said well
[1:20:45] you're right I made just like you are
[1:20:51] coming it's real simple if you really
[1:20:53] look at this whole thing's everything
[1:20:55] the whole plan is so simple the plan of
[1:20:57] redemption what happened in the garden
[1:20:59] and what we're going back to above like
[1:21:01] I said filial love it went from agape
[1:21:04] level all the way down brother Brown
[1:21:05] said it goes down to lush we'll see
[1:21:06] that's got to go back it's got to go
[1:21:09] back to filial to agape love which is
[1:21:12] the headstone that we got to go back to
[1:21:14] that a man we think we really love our
[1:21:16] spouse or we really love our children
[1:21:18] that's just one grain pebble of sand on
[1:21:21] the beach in the whole world compared to
[1:21:23] what God's love is a man all right let's
[1:21:27] read this right here number seven goes
[1:21:33] before the fall here's brother Branham
[1:21:36] no marriage in divorce so that still be
[1:21:39] careful I'm just going to read this all
[1:21:41] right
[1:21:42] and he made her for him and not man for
[1:21:48] her did you know that woman was made for
[1:21:52] man and not man for woman how many know
[1:21:54] that congregation says I'm in the Bible
[1:21:56] teaches that all right she was given a
[1:21:58] place in man before the fall equal over
[1:22:03] all creation that's why with Christ the
[1:22:11] bride is going to be heirs in joint a
[1:22:13] we're coming back to that Christ came
[1:22:16] listen and I think we read it last
[1:22:19] Sunday the property guard said whatever
[1:22:20] Adam lost in the fall Christ came and
[1:22:23] restored us back to that level
[1:22:26] and then we just got our flu stopped up
[1:22:28] and not enough word to bring us to that
[1:22:31] okay you preaching to me she was given a
[1:22:36] place in man before the fall equal over
[1:22:38] all creation but after the fall now here
[1:22:41] we bring the subject up because remember
[1:22:43] he's in marriage the divorce but after
[1:22:46] the fall he was her ruler listen before
[1:22:51] the fall the Covenant was as long as you
[1:22:53] don't eat of that tree you're fine all
[1:22:55] of your fine everybody's fine your equal
[1:22:59] whatever Adam and Eve indeed they were
[1:23:00] listen they were literally each other
[1:23:05] she just had a spirit that leaned toward
[1:23:07] what emotion and he had a spirit toward
[1:23:10] look at Lowndes
[1:23:11] you know you like sister Gail she would
[1:23:13] be just a perfect homemaker making
[1:23:15] everything putting everything together
[1:23:16] and dicks going to work it comes home
[1:23:19] knows that sister girls don't have
[1:23:21] everything ready well see that was the
[1:23:22] same thing with Adam and Eve and what
[1:23:26] they did it complemented each other they
[1:23:28] complemented each other
[1:23:29] amen that's why before the fall you
[1:23:33] don't see any squabbling between Adam
[1:23:37] and Eve but after the fall what's the
[1:23:39] first thing she does he goes it was that
[1:23:42] woman you gave me then that woman said
[1:23:45] it was that beast person right over here
[1:23:47] and then the beast was over I going the
[1:23:51] devil made me do it
[1:24:03] you have a bad thought the devil made me
[1:24:07] do it but after the fall now here's
[1:24:09] where we bring the subject up but after
[1:24:11] the fall he was her ruler she must keep
[1:24:13] silent in all matters now after the
[1:24:15] original beginning is over all right
[1:24:18] Jesus said it wasn't so from the
[1:24:20] beginning that's when time began when
[1:24:23] God made it first in his original
[1:24:24] creation all that understands say amen
[1:24:27] what's he talking about before and the
[1:24:29] Genesis 1:26 man was made in eternity
[1:24:31] not time when God listened to me when
[1:24:35] God put that 1:26 into that 2:7 man was
[1:24:38] still in eternity hello time didn't
[1:24:43] begin I read it time began when the fall
[1:24:46] again all right in the beginning God
[1:24:48] created just one male and one female
[1:24:51] but then the woman was made different
[1:24:53] from the animals all other animals for
[1:24:55] deception she wasn't made by God for
[1:25:00] deception remember that she was made ,
[1:25:03] not like the other man animal she could
[1:25:06] be deceived and she could deceive
[1:25:08] because you got a soul because I'm like
[1:25:11] I'm like mostly brother branham was not
[1:25:14] a woman-hater
[1:25:14] but he knew one thing for sure that a
[1:25:17] that a vile woman could hurt you worse
[1:25:19] than a Bioman - right y'all won't know
[1:25:23] that we've been in the world we know
[1:25:25] that a one woman can tear a man apart
[1:25:28] many men apart all right all on animals
[1:25:32] for now watch now it wasn't so from the
[1:25:34] guiness she was made if she had stayed
[1:25:36] in the original condition with Adam
[1:25:41] co-equal with Adam stayed right here but
[1:25:47] but she wouldn't have never been no
[1:25:51] fault but she caused the fall and the
[1:25:54] interruption that broke the whole
[1:25:55] continuity of God now it didn't surprise
[1:25:58] him he knew that was going to happen
[1:26:01] and throw death sorrow and everything
[1:26:04] else on the earth she was made to us now
[1:26:07] notice now after at the beginning after
[1:26:10] the beginning after time began all right
[1:26:14] because remember back in eternity she
[1:26:16] looked back in that was eternity is over
[1:26:20] what are we going back to eternity we've
[1:26:25] slipped down in time and now we're going
[1:26:27] right back to eternity because remember
[1:26:29] everything that was lost has to be
[1:26:33] redeemed back to its original place
[1:26:36] blood brother I'm say take her back to
[1:26:38] watch the Garden of Eden take her back
[1:26:40] to the Garden of Eden which is herb's a
[1:26:42] bride amen
[1:26:44] notice after that fall was made by Eve
[1:26:46] after the fall there would need to be
[1:26:48] another covenant made now this is going
[1:26:50] to stumble you but I'm going to give you
[1:26:52] the scripture to prove that this is the
[1:26:53] truth now notice after the fall Jesus
[1:26:56] said God at the beginning made one of a
[1:26:57] kind but now after the fall now we're
[1:27:00] going beyond that the Covenant was cold
[1:27:03] equal but now after the fall there's
[1:27:10] another covenant made she was no longer
[1:27:12] ruler with him each must have a separate
[1:27:17] covenant all right let's go to Genesis
[1:27:20] 3:14 and we're going to read that
[1:27:22] covenant and then we'll stop right there
[1:27:24] in about hour and ten minutes I won't
[1:27:26] try to try to keep like I said will I
[1:27:29] appreciate brother Delphi let me do this
[1:27:31] because remember you know you have to
[1:27:32] try to pack it all in now I can kind of
[1:27:35] you know be like a baton racer I can
[1:27:39] just stop for a minute and then take off
[1:27:41] again so brother Ernie you'll be here
[1:27:43] next weekend so we can kind of a time to
[1:27:44] just relax and hope you don't sleep on
[1:27:46] him like you do me you won't because if
[1:27:49] somebody knew we do the same thing and
[1:27:53] the Lord God said under the surface now
[1:27:55] this is after the fall because down has
[1:27:58] done this I'm going to skip that part we
[1:28:00] all know what happened because thou hast
[1:28:02] done this thou art cursed above all
[1:28:04] cattle but remember even had to accept
[1:28:05] seed here first you got to accept seed
[1:28:10] here first she accepted Satan's lie
[1:28:13] first and then what this
[1:28:15] Bonni only maxed what she was thinking
[1:28:18] and it produced what it produced that
[1:28:21] all right it wasn't just the sake we
[1:28:24] always say it wasn't just the sex side
[1:28:25] right it was her accepting Satan's lie
[1:28:28] first then what her body had to follow
[1:28:31] amen because she had failed from that
[1:28:34] condition thou art cursed alright look
[1:28:36] he curse the Satan above every beast of
[1:28:38] the field what he cursed them the
[1:28:41] missing link or the Beast the serpent
[1:28:45] cursed above all cattle ever be
[1:28:47] fulfilled upon thy belly shalt thou go
[1:28:49] we know what he was turned into a snake
[1:28:50] and dust shalt thou eat all the days
[1:28:52] your life and he has not finished eatin
[1:28:54] dust yet every time you die he's eating
[1:28:58] your dust that's why we're going to the
[1:29:00] grave because Satan is eating our dust
[1:29:04] we go we're going we're going to reverse
[1:29:06] that folks because that wasn't true
[1:29:09] before the fall and I will put enmity
[1:29:12] now that word enmity means division
[1:29:16] remember when Lazarus was in the bosom
[1:29:18] of Abraham and he looks over and sees a
[1:29:20] rich young ruler and rich young ruler
[1:29:22] said can I come over to you he said no
[1:29:23] there's a great gulf fixed
[1:29:25] there's enmity the carnal mind the Bible
[1:29:28] says is what enmity God knew this that
[1:29:31] Satan got to her brain first the man got
[1:29:36] to her brain first so he takes him put
[1:29:38] enmity between thee and the woman
[1:29:40] between thy seed and her seed it shall
[1:29:42] bruise thy head and thou shalt bruise
[1:29:43] his heel I just a woman now here's the
[1:29:46] separate covenant until the woman he
[1:29:48] said I will greatly multiply thy sorrow
[1:29:50] we know what that is and thy conception
[1:29:51] in sorrow shalt thou bring forth
[1:29:54] children and thy desire to be to thy
[1:29:57] husband and he shall rule over thee all
[1:29:59] right and into Adam here's his covenant
[1:30:02] and into Adam he said because thou has
[1:30:04] hearkened unto the voice of thy wife he
[1:30:07] couldn't help it
[1:30:08] that was him that was him Jesus Christ
[1:30:12] couldn't help coming to the earth to
[1:30:13] save us why because we were are a part
[1:30:18] of him not were but we are and has to
[1:30:23] eat another tree of which I commanded
[1:30:24] thee saying thou shalt not eat of it
[1:30:26] cursed is the ground now you didn't
[1:30:27] curse Adam
[1:30:29] he cursed the ground he didn't curse at
[1:30:31] him
[1:30:33] he cursed the ground that's why when
[1:30:35] Cain brought his fruit of the ground it
[1:30:37] was already cursed before it got there
[1:30:39] because he brought the fruit that come
[1:30:41] up out of the ground and God had already
[1:30:42] cursed the ground
[1:30:43] what did Abel do he took a lamb flesh
[1:30:47] killed it and God accepted it cursed is
[1:30:51] the ground for thy sake in sorrow shalt
[1:30:53] thou eat of it all the days of your life
[1:30:56] amen
[1:30:58] so there's the fall of man and we'll
[1:31:02] stop right there because the next I
[1:31:03] wanted to go into and we'll do it next
[1:31:05] next time is the book of redemption the
[1:31:08] book of life Adam didn't lose eternal
[1:31:12] life in his soul he lost a position that
[1:31:17] he would be able to bring all of his
[1:31:19] children that God had in his mind
[1:31:22] brother Branham said God what Adam had
[1:31:26] to give the book to the original owner
[1:31:31] again Satan doesn't own this book Satan
[1:31:34] doesn't own this earth he's a squatter
[1:31:36] he's just put here because you know why
[1:31:39] because God can't stand sin Satan you
[1:31:43] just take over what you need to take
[1:31:44] over but I'm going to come down into
[1:31:47] your Eden and I'm gonna bring my
[1:31:49] children whether you like it or not
[1:31:51] you're not going to stop it I'm going to
[1:31:54] come down here and I'm going to hide
[1:31:55] myself in a group of people that you're
[1:31:59] not even going to believe can do it but
[1:32:04] it's in the will already but Adam had to
[1:32:07] hand the book back to God because this
[1:32:10] is the book of names that you and I are
[1:32:13] in this book this is our will you know
[1:32:15] what if you have a will your names got
[1:32:17] to be in that wheel somewhere it doesn't
[1:32:20] just say well whoever wants us whoever
[1:32:22] wants this car you can have the car no
[1:32:25] it says to Susan for Bush I give to
[1:32:28] don't accomplish I give the way now I
[1:32:31] give to mark action rod I give you just
[1:32:36] read yourself all in the Bible I give
[1:32:38] what right here
[1:32:42] there's you will and he had to die to
[1:32:45] give you that world and then what he
[1:32:49] done to make sure that you got your part
[1:32:53] of the world
[1:32:54] he brought the Willer look out of a
[1:33:00] dictionary he bought the Weller buy the
[1:33:03] one that made the will came back inside
[1:33:05] of me and you to make sure that that
[1:33:06] reflection would look right back and
[1:33:11] when you open this Bible what do you see
[1:33:13] a reflection of you let's stand to our
[1:33:17] feet we'll start next Sunday on Adam
[1:33:20] lost the right to the book of redemption
[1:33:23] amen
[1:33:25] he lost the right to the book of
[1:33:27] Redemption that stupid love y'all y'all
[1:33:31] did good not many of you went to the
