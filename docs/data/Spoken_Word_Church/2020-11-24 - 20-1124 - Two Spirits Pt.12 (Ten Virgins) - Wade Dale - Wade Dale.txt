you know what if you love the world and the things of the world love God's not in you so all right so let me start with the announcements real quick they're on the U Church website but uh I'll uh

which is this coming Tuesday I will be speaking pray for me cuz I have a u council meeting that night and I'm supposed to cook turkey so I don't know what I'm going to do I guess I'll throw it at them and run out the door and come up here so that's okay though don't mind can't be in two places at once but you can be there pretty quickly so we'll try to do that also so December the 6 brother Dale and I will be in Kentucky at Brother Richard Hyatts we will be leaving on that Wednesday the the U December the 2nd to go to Illinois to hunt for about 4 days and then bre with Brother Richard hayatt brother Louise will be speaking that Sunday December the 6th Sunday December the 6th so he shook his head so he knows December 13th we've already talked about the Christmas dinner brother Dale will be speaking then then there will be no service on December 30th December 31st brother William Boron will be doing our watch notot service so uh he's been here uh many times before and did our watch notot service I think before brother Chris did it for three times in a row so he's real happy to come down here he was sitting on the deer stand when I sent him when I called him and he sent me a text he said I'm on a deer stand I went so I need to talk to you son so anyway I let him get done he did kill a 9-point buck that last night so and then he called me back huffing and puffing trying to get the thing out of the woods so he's really happy to come so that's sister Monica's uh brother so God bless him and we've got all that set up then and if you need some more information on that it'll be on the Church website Happy Thanksgiving to everyone which will be this coming Thursday and please be safe it's like brother Boyd said I've been talking to uh one head of a family there in Gillsville today and he said this thing just tore his family apart because some of the daughters don't want to come some of the sons don't want to come and the ones that aren't coming are mad at the ones that are not coming and so anyway turmoil everywhere so but uh we're going to make it amen amen we're going to make it amen we've got a promise to make it now they may not have a promise to make it we got a promise to make it all right amen so that's where I rest in I rest in that I don't rest in a uh a vaccine we took the vaccine when we were always when we seen that high and lifted up you know what that is that's when Christ went to Calvary he said if he said if I don't he said he said if I be lifted up he was lifted up by a Roman Tree but he was lifted for me and you and you and I don't have to we don't have to die we don't have to take any of this anymore he took it every bit the only thing we got to do is believe that he's already done it amen and that's why that we in this uh series of two Spirits I've been thinking the week um we see that we when we've been doing the contrast back in Genesis and the different places it looks like evil against good and it always is evil against good but when you get down to the end time it's evil against good and you don't know the difference unless you got the Holy Ghost and even with the Holy Ghost you can be deceived right but you can't be lost right right can't be lost right you're not going to lose that's why we're we're going to speak tonight on 10 virgins and we'll get to the end of that and cuz there's where you two Spirits are because even though they are virgins the five foolish virgins did not have the baptism of the Holy Ghost so they had another Spirit besides the Holy Spirit right but they had just enough of God till their testimony helped them get all the way to the white Throne judgment and be given eternal life I don't want to stake my chances on that folks right uhuh no I want to be one of the wise virgins amen so if you got your Bibles let's turn to 1 John 4 and continue with this just keep us in your prayer like I said again have a safe Thanksgiving we will be back here Sunday Lord with him brother Dale will be speaking then we'll have a baptismal service afterwards so also like as brother Boyd said Brother D now we're talking coming down coming back from Illinois the other day and he wants to get back into the special singing cuz you know if we do the order of what the church order says well brother Bram says a couple of congregational songs a couple of outstanding he says outstanding specials take up an offering and bring a preacher out instead of this long 15 song thing you know we're going to go by what brother Brown says a couple of specials right couple of songs couple of worship songs which was good tonight couple of worship songs to get in worship atmosphere and then bring the minister out cuz that's what's important amen so that's what we're going to try to do also if you don't have this sheet I don't know if brother Joe's got it but he can get it for you of the list of the people and make sure your song leaders get them before they get here right we want them to either call them or let them practice don't just rush up and say Zach you're singing tonight no we want we want you to be able to practice cuz we want you to do your best right and like teren said if you need to practice in the shower that's fine you can practice in the shower just don't expect any musicians to be around except the water running out of the shower so two Spirits we're going to speak on 10 virgins tonight let's bow our heads heavenly father thank you for this day that you've given us Lord that we can still stand here in Freedom that we'll always be free in Christ but Lord there's another Spirit working in the end time that's trying to suppress us and keep us from worshiping together and keep us from fellowshipping together and Lord we're sheep we're herd animals we need to be together we need to have each other to lean on we have to have each other to talk on we don't we're not loners Lord we are hurt animals we're sheep of your pastor Lord and we pray that you would just bind all the enemies that's trying to come not so much into the church but into our bodies now as many times we're talking about uh our spiritual need well right now I think we're in a transition between physical need and spiritual need father but we always need you spiritually but now Lord we need you in the Physical Realm to help us Lord get through this you said that we have won but you said that we would have to overcome in order to win so father there's something that we have to overcome Lord and it's these two spirits that we need to discern yes what's right and what's wrong father forgive us of our sins be with the ones Lord that are fighting this disease Brother Ray mcgomery now as wife Sister Rita Lord we also pray for the Johnny silky family we forgot to announce but we will now Lord you know he went on to be with you Lord a couple of nights ago we pray for the family that you'll give them Lord just compassion and peace that no one else can give them Lord bless brother Claude is now he's lost a church member there Lord a song leader we pray that You' just fill that void father with someone that's that's full of the Holy Ghost and can help the people father give us today our daily bread you be the one that speaks Lord and let us all be the ones that listens to what you say we ask these things in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen yeah I pray for brother Claude you know he Lo he lost his song leader and brother Johnny was a real uh solid uh brother in the church and uh he just couldn't overcome it wasn't all covid related he had many different issues but they all bounced off each other for a few days and then all of a sudden he started bleeding internally and he passed away a couple days ago so uh really good brother enjoyed him didn't with Dad he's real good brother so 1 John 4 verse1 beloved believe not every Spirit but try the spirits for the L of God you know you do that every day that's not just coming in on Sunday and on Wednesday if you fight the devil only right here you're in trouble you ought to fight him more out there and shed him when you walk in here amen so beloved believe not every Spirit but try the spirit were the they of God because many false prophets are gone out into the world and see that's what we're going to talk about on the 10 versions how those false prophets deceive there is no false prophet can do you any good right except show you the false but you've got to be able to see that because there's a lot of people think that they're true and they're false right amen that's where the deception is hereby know ye the spirit of God every spirit that confesses that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is of God and every spirit that confesses not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is not of God and this is that Spirit of antichrist whereof ye have heard that it should come and even now already is it in the world that's been 2,000 years ago think about that was an infant form there think about now at the headship time where Satan comes to his head and Christ comes to his headship how much more deceiving it is ye are of God little children and have overcome them because greater is he that's in you than he that's in the world they are of the world therefore speak they of the world and the world heareth them we are of God he that knoweth God heareth us he that is not of God heareth not us hereby know we the spirit of truth and the spirit of error you may be seated the Lord as his Blessing to the reading of the word just remember those announcements and uh like I said just go back to the first of the tape if you want them again just go back to the first of the tape and you you'll hear the announcement all over again so um have no confusion this is the age of instant information and if you need it again all you got to do is pull it back up hit refresh so now let's go to Matthew ma Matthew 25 verse 1 says then shall the Kingdom of Heaven be likened unto 10 virgins which took their lamps and went forth to meet the bridegroom and five of them were wise and five of them were foolish they that were foolish took their lamps and took no oil with them but the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps right amen we know what we know what the type of the oil in the Bible is the baptism of the Holy Ghost so that means one has it and one didn't all right now remember as we go through this we're going to background just a minute but keep this in your mind there is no in between Christian either you're lost or you're saved you're either sealed in or you're sealed out exactly and you by your character will be able to know that by Jesus said by your fruits you shall be known all right so by your fruits you're going the world is going to see manifesting time like never before this is going to the cream's going to rise to the top the world always talks about having all their uh you know their star athletes you know they they put the last the fastest guy on the fourth leg of the of the of the relay why that means if you're a little bit behind you got your best guy to finish the race well you know what God's got his best guy the Bride of Jesus Christ to finish this race it may seem like somebody got behind but I think when the prophet went off the scene he passed the Baton to me and you he didn't pass the Baton to one person he passed it to a many membered bride to take us out of here and get us in a Rapture all right so now let's read what um the one we've always read exposition of the church ages just to background just for a minute now remember this Christ in the true church is a a continuation of the book of Acts that's what we're looking at now but the Book of Revelation so how that Antichrist Spirit would come now look not so much in the book of Acts when you see the book of Acts you see the book of The Acts of the Apostles and what's going on Silver and Gold Have I None they walked to the shadow of Peter and got healed they they had all things common they had all these different things and but now the Book of Revelations is a prophetic book right a book of Revelations is where it splits to two because as brother Bram tells us we were we I was listening to brother Brown the other day and the Lord just showed you know everything started in Genesis so you see the two Spirits right there Christ and Lucifer Cain and Abel every how you want to say it and then it kind of as we were talking last time remember the sons of God married the daughters of men and you really couldn't tell who was who right even in the spiritual world because if you were to look at balam and all these different ones that were anti- word you think hey balam did not do anything at the point that God remember he done the seven reals he done all the sacrificing Bok wanted him to go out there and curse Israel and Bam says I can't well man we' think oh man that's a holy ghost filed preacher buddy he he told that guy what no he was just buying his time because the devil was working the whole time oh yeah he was working all way down through until balum finally figured out by that other spirit that he could not override God's will but he could go around just like what did what did Satan do he did the same thing he couldn't directly go and say now Eve you know God's not real no he said I know God's real but you'll not surely die bam just goes over there and says hey let's just get them all to marry again so here you go back into intering intermingling again right now what have you done down through we'll talk about in just a few minutes with the 10 virgins you see that when Jesus came on Earth there was Jesus Jesus and Judas now remember let's get one thing for sure Judas was not the beginning of evil the beginning of evil was Lucifer we know that but it hid itself all the way down but just for a moment it popped his head up with Judas because remember Judas wasn't an adversary of Jesus until right at the very end right right Jesus called him friend Jesus said I know what you're going to do but I'm still going to choose you the Bible says he knew from the beginning when he chose him so here you go putting it back together again but then you see Paul comes out and Paul says Grievous wolves will come among you then here in first John and John sees the Antichrist and he sees that it splits a little bit but in the end time it goes right back together so we have to go to the Book of Revelations is what brother Brown saying we got to go to the Book of Revelations to show show how that the Antichrist Spirit would come into the church how it would come in defile it making it lukew formal and Powerless it exposes Satan revealing his work the attempted destruction of God's people and the discrediting of God's word now not doing away with God's word just discrediting it exactly all right right down to the time he is cast into the Lake of Fire he fights that he cannot stand it he knows that if the people see know he knows he's sitting here today listening to every sermon that's being preached all over the well of course on Tuesday night there's not many but every time a sermon is being preached the devil's right there he's listening to see what's going on so he can counteract because I don't think he has prophetic Insight I don't think he knows what's going to happen tomorrow if he does he don't believe it cuz if he did he'd just lay down and die I'd just give up cuz you know the the the the Bible says he loses and we win right but there was so much iniquity found in him just like in the world now when everybody thinks they're right I mean it's come down to my goodness look at the new cabinet that we got coming in with the with the new Administration I mean come on people this world is in trouble a transgender couple of homosexuals okay leading our government leading our government and I'm not saying anything between the two parties I'm just telling you it's all corrupt there is not one thing good except the goodness of God that's going to show us that a government's not going to save you the kingdom of God is going to save you amen he knows that if the people get the true revelation of the true church and what she is and what she stands for and that she can can do the Greater Works she will be an invincible Army if they get a true revelation of the two Spirits within the framework as I said before the the 2x4s of the Christian church not this building but this building yeah and by God's spirit discern and withstand so there's got to be somebody that's going to discern and withstand it and they're not going to be popular oh no they're going to be hated right brother Brown said that hated group I'll bring that quote in another sermon that he said that hated group they'll hate you who not the denominations message folks are going to hate you cuz you've got a true revelation of the two Spirits within the framework of this message church right not so much this one but I'm everywhere there is two Spirits working in every church I don't care where it's at amen and remember God's not trying to get he's tried to get back in the denominations but brother M said they've already put them out now we were listening to a tape coming home the other day and you think we get a little Budd he heads were rolling and he was preaching to baptist Methodist Pentecostal talking about what kind of demons they had in them with wearing the shorts and the hair and the dress boy brother randam let them have it right that's why it wasn't very popular but you know what it was the Bible but if they get a true re reation of the two Spirits within the framework of the Christian church and by God's spirit deser and withstand the Antichrist Spirit Satan will be powerless before her number two an exposition of the seven Church ages this is quote number two did you get it now there are those twins again there are those two trees again growing side by side in the same Earth partaking of the same message hello somebody that's n don't you get you get nourished Yeah by apples and oranges and green beans and but your soul gets nourished by the word of God and not by the false word you can't get nourishment from a false word if you're a True Believer that's right right drinking in the same rain and benefitting by the same son right but they come from different seeds one tree is for the word of God exactly as God give it and loves it and obeys it the other tree is from the seed that is anti the word of God and changes it where it wants to it substitutes its own Creeds and dogmas for the living true word exactly as did Cain who ended up killing Abel but fear not little flock stay with the word keep that word between you and the devil Eve did not do that and she failed and when the church lets down on the word she goes into the depths of the darkness right of Satan wow that's a that's a powerful quote because you know what that's what happened when you and you go to your 10 virgins sure they're virgins but they weren't filled with the Holy Holy Ghost yeah they were filled with anti- word right now some were in there in their Spirit realm and that sanctification part that's going to carry them but they're going to have to die in the tribulation and they're going to have to come before the white throne and give an account of what they did right listen if you're born again tonight you'll never have to give an account of what you did glory amen you never will have to give an count on what you did cuz you know what the real you didn't do it there's the wise virgins that fills their oil with something besides Creeds and dogmas and I'm talking about in the message right I'm not talking about out there if that fools you you're in trouble you need to get the Holy Ghost I mean listen we're so far up the road now till goodness gracious let's look at the law of reproduction cuz remember the law of reproduction caused this deception because God said let every seed bring forth of its kind and Satan was standing there and he said okay I know what Adam's got and I know what Eve's got and I'm going to work on Eve because she's the weaker one of the two and I'm going to deceive her because deception is the cause to accept as true or valid what is false are invalid right she accepted truth as if she accepted sorry false as if it were truth she accepted that the church the first church Eve was the first church and that's what she accepted and she accepted it as truth let's look at Matthew 6:22 the light of the body is the eye if therefore th ey be single thy whole body shall be full of light but if thine eye be evil right thy whole body shall be full of Darkness if therefore the light that is in thee be Darkness how great is that Darkness right let's read number three what does it take to have make a Christian Life Eve actually thought she was right listen Eve didn't go into this thinking that she was some that it was some dirty act she was trying to fulfill the word of God by her interpretation along with the devil right right ain't that what happening now they're interpreting the word to fit what they think is the word of God now listen these people are not going to church to think of evil they're not going to church to think they're anti no that's the deception yeah right the prophet of God said in the end time they'll be actually making love with Satan thinking they're making love are knowing god right that's the deception how deceiving but if that light in you be Darkness how great is that Darkness how can you tell them that it's dark how can you tell them and look at the Methodist and look at the M Baptist and look at the people in the message with all these weird doctrines how can you look at them and say you're false right if they think that's light you got to fight exactly maybe sometimes physical get their righteous indignation up but you know one thing's for sure if you do that that's another Spirit right amen Eve actually thought she was right so this whole pretense of these two Spirits there is that look that there's only one guy that knows he's antiw and that's Satan right he knows he's against the word he hates the word he hates the people of the word but he wants the people to be deceived into believing that what they're hearing is from God if you people get that that's what he's doing it's so close not so evil right I know I did Evil right but if I'm standing here today with the wrong spirit and a wrong Doctrine I'm just as I'm more evil right than if I was drinking a beer and smoking a cigar I might have a chance but you won't have a chance listen you say all those virgins were those were virgin yes but listen they were false they were part of the Antichrist system there's only Christ and Antichrist there is no in between there is no gray area that we can get so much and then not get enough but still make it you're either sealed in or you're sealed out amen she was getting some new light now listen Satan's transformed into a messenger of light we know that but his light is Darkness folks right remember he's a painting fire he's one of those Illusions to make you think that it's the light of God right see how deceiving it is she was getting some new light that Satan was giving her he's still giving her new light right folks that was 6,000 years ago that Eve got new light from Satan 6,000 years ago don't you think he's more deceptive now than he was 6,000 years ago it's not a baby form anymore it's a full grown man that Antichrist is going to be a full grown head of the world he is actually probably right now being groomed and fixed I know it's that close right that he's being groomed and fixed by Satan himself but through a system but the but but the Methodist said it's not us because we got God and the B says no it's not us cuz we got God and the Pentecost says no we got God and then half the message people that are half message people I don't know which half but they think oh we're of God we go to church we believe God sent a prophet that's okay but let this thing go on I told you when we started I'm not preaching to people you preach to Spirits because a spirit even can get on you and me a wrong spirit and have to be prayed away or prayed off or or get rid of as as I was carrying that one around against this brother all you got to do man just call him and apologize you know what that's why the Bible says res resist the devil and he'll flee from you you know what you're resisting you're not resisting the devil and you know no you're doing what God Said by doing that that resists the devil cuz he hates the right part of the word he hates for you to do the word right that's why he's so deceived the people had a situation just few days ago I mean how you going to tell we hunt with a group of people that I know they're not going to listen to this so it doesn't matter I can call their name but they're religious they pray problem knows they pray they talk about God sometimes use his name a little bit different but they drink smoke curse live with their women and don't marry them you understand what I'm saying but yet they go to church oh yeah now you see that and but I'm not judging those people I see that that spirit I was telling you coming to church how can he be a Christian how can they brother John is that your keys laying on the floor there I just discerned that they were laying right beside you so anyway you may need them to get out of here and you'll blame the kids for having them and okay but how can you be in the same mold yeah as that and say you've got the Holy Ghost and they talk about the Holy Spirit oh the Holy Spirit told me to do this God told me to do this and yet they're sitting there drinking their Bush light smoking their cigarettes cursing using God's name in vain but they're Christians now see to me that doesn't that doesn't fool me but look how fool who they are you want to look at them and say dude if you got the Holy Ghost and I got the Holy Ghost and my Holy Ghost says not to do that that's right my Holy Ghost actually forbids me to do that and I enjoy it because I don't have that Spirit you got anymore you know what that's going to make them mad oh because they think they have light right they've been told it's okay oh you know what the first thing they'll say to you nobody's perfect we all got problems talking to a guy the other day there at the at um in Gillsville and he had been God had healed him with cancer a long time ago but his whole thought was is you know I fall I slip up I say God's name in vain every once in a while I I you know he he was making excuses and like I said I'm not talking about my people I'm not talking about the people that we talk about or that we hunt with I'm talking about the spirit that's motivating that and they're saying it's the Holy Spirit The Same Spirit I got right and sometimes it rises up inside me and I don't know whether it's the Holy Spirit of mine yeah sister an got about that big too but you know you don't know when that thing Rises up and you're and you let them have it in other words yeah you know brother rown did that one time remember he sat down and that guy got up and was just letting him have it and he said that guy beside him was going to get up and say something he said no he said I wanted any myself right well see sometime every once in a while you take about all you can take and then you look them straight in the eye and say brother I'm your brother I love you with the love of the Lord but you ain't got the same spirit I got either you wrong and I'm right or I'm right and you're wrong but we both can't be right now listen that's a deception of the world now let's bring that spirit in though and set it in this church and say I wear my dresses long I have my hair long I don't smoke I don't drink I don't curse I come to church every Sunday I come to church every Wednesday I must be all right but then let something happen let somebody say something to you let something happen let something help you bear your fruit actually help you show your fruit and then you you wonder what's going on well see that's where the two Spirits are come back together now I'm not worried about that I'm not wor see I'm not worried about brother Donnie I am not worried about Brett and those people up there in Illinois deceiving me they're deceived right we don't have the same Spirit there is no way we know that but how do you talk to somebody that thinks they're light and it's dark right their souls is black as sight and if they don't change their ways they're going to hell or they're going to have to be judged for what they done ex right cuz but now see the the five foolish virgins though are A step above that see there's a group of people that in the gospels that come up to Jesus at the at the at the end and says have I not cast out Devils have I not preached your gospel have they're so bold they're look Jesus is giving them judgment and they're going have I not done these things in your name you know what he's going to say depart from me I never had a personal relationship with you and you never let me in that inner man right you never let me inside of the inside you let me on the inside yeah you might have cleaned my spirit up like you did with the 10 virgins or the five foolish he cleaned their Spirit realm up but something stopped them that other Spirit or that other seed we want to talk about which seed is a word they took a false word and said it was true and that put them in another group oh yeah what about that like I said before I don't look at people I look at that spirit that is speaking through those people that is telling those people you're okay yeah you make mistakes what a couple of beers are not going to bother you a couple of and then you start adding these couplers up and it's like I asked that guy one time when I got saved he you know he held up a beer and said well praise the Lord I'm glad you got saved I said John John stump was his name he was a banker in Gainesville I said John what did you get save from I said save means to if I and we were out in a boat I said if I kicked you out of this boat into the water you don't think I kick it high at 60 years old did you it hurts but I did it twice Jun don't have to drag me out of bed in the morning I said John I said being saved is you were in a position when I kicked you out of the boat you need a saving now that was a different position than what you was before I said when I reached in that water and grabbed you out of that water and set you in the boat I saved you now what you just told me you did is you fell back in the water see they didn't get saved to start with they had an emotion they had a feeling they had a something going on thank God for a prophet but listen we take this and we look and we see that the prophet brought us further than that cuz remember folks before the prophet came and before the seals were opened God allowed water baptism in the name of father son Holy Ghost by permissive will he allowed all these denominations to come up we'll look at in just a second he allowed that to happen but remember God told him way back a long time he said I'll not always strive with man right I'm going to allow this in other words what he did back there in Genesis when the sons of God married the daughters of men then God said God actually the Bible said repented that he had made man knowing what they would do anyway right so he said I'm going to destroy them all but Noah found Grace in the eyes of the Lord glory amen have you and I found Grace in the eyes of the Lord Brother Brown told in one quote I didn't bring it he said those foolish virgins is like those people that were standing all those years and listen to Noah preach it's going to rain it's going to rain it's going to rain it's going to rain and then God shut the door he said those foolish virgins were the ones that were hanging on to the boat when the water was coming up they were that and and and the illustration was they were this far from being saved the thickness of the wall of the Ark was from condemnation to Salvation right if they would have just listened to the messenger of their day listen they didn't have to do the hair and the dress and don't go to this and don't do they just had to believe what Noah said right but you know what if they would have all believed that God would have had to buil a bigger boat or many other boats but he knew how many was going to accept it he knew how many was going to reject it and he built the boat for eight people and a bunch of animals that's what he's done now he knows how many is going to make it he know he knows who the wise virgin is he knows who the foolish virgin is but listen there's a place for the foolish virgin I don't want to be in that place don't ever think that you're sitting here today and saying well if I don't understand what brother Wade and brother Dale and all the different ministers are saying I'll just be a foolish virgin no you won't no no a foolish virgin was deceived by the word they heard right the seed that was planted by some preacher some somebody you didn't hear that from here amen you didn't hear that from here right amen all right Romans 9 let's go that my phone ringing barking I thought I cut cut it off anyway they'll call back later Romans 9 verse 10 watch remember we were talking about this word called election and not only this but when Rebecca also had conceived by one even my father Isaac for the children being not yet born neither having done any good or evil that the purpose of God according to election might stand now remember for those of you that weren't here we know what election is we just went through an election people voted people vot this many voted for this side there many voted for this side whoever got the most votes win one we had a a little election at and yes I do vote I'm an American sorry I vote so you know what I vote because I can say what I need to say about it okay if you didn't vote then shut up all right so anyway so we had this little special election and it was a um um his name's sweet boy hu but his name's Wayne hu but his wife ran for some probate J J she won by one vote they recounted recount she won by one vote it was the first time me and June had voted and we voted in that election and two of us voted for Helen his wife so I told when that came out I told Wayne I said me and June voted first time we voted in 20 years that's the first thing we vote we voted for Helen to be a probate judge and I said if we a have voted your wife would have lost yeah so God voted for you the devil voted against you somebody's got to untie the vote right because you're a free moral agent and your vote will give you two to one one way of the other all right according to election might stand not of works but of him that calleth it was said unto her the Elder Shall Serve the younger as it is written Jacob have I loved and all have I hated Romans 8:30 we need to continue this thought because remember it's not just that he stamped Esau dead we we prove that back even with Cain Cain was not sure he was of that Wicked one sure Cain came from the serpent but his soul came from God Amen and his soul had a choice to choose the election right but God knew before the foundation of the world that it would be God one Satan two in Cain's purpose amen that's to me that's just very simple but he did it by what forn knowledge he forew everything that was going to go on so he predetermined or predestinated every bit of this cuz remember brother BR said he don't predestinate by his desires you know if he PR predestinate by's desire desires it wouldn't be a hell there wouldn't be a devil there wouldn't be nobody lost would be nobody sick but because he had attributes those had to be displayed being God infinite they had to be displayed and in order to be displayed he had to allow Satan to do what he did he had to allow allow you to choose which one you got the same Choice listen I spoke to many many people and people around the message oh you don't have a choice you just was born with this seed in you you know and it just you just come to life one day right what the world what's going on that ain't even sensible they'll tell you in the denominational world that you were lost and you needed salvation you needed somewhere to listen to somebody tell you about God and then God would come into your soul listen folks it's just like it's just like a man and a woman getting together to have a baby there's millions of little potential life every sperm is potential life but it's got to find that one egg right and when it finds that one egg one sperm one egg they all potentially are life every one of them but by election God knew which one would pick this one he remember brother Brown said he he bred this one to this one like Bob was talking about other night this one to get you here cuz there was a character he held that character back before the found foundational world he held that character right and that character that you have today if you're born again is not like God it is God and it's got to be of that one seed Not seeds as of many one seed which is Christ right always listen to brother Bri on me he's talking a little bit about marriage and divorce he had to bring that out marriage and divorce he said there's David 500 wives but they only had one husband right Solomon had a thousand individual wives and hundreds of concubines I do not know how he got any work done but he had them but they only had one husband rightly same way with you and I we are a many membered body but we're only Born Again by one quickened right word listen Paul said the letter kth there's that all that dead all that dead stuff around us right whatever brought you here today whatever gave you the baptism of the Holy Ghost is that quickening word that God put in this Bible before the foundation of the world knowing you would need it by for knowledge he predetermined this Bible would be written exactly the way it's written and that you and I would respond to that very scripture I didn't respond to every one of them I can preach on Genesis 126 and some of you when somebody preaches on Genesis 126 I go give me some more but see if somebody preaches on Matthew 24:24 somebody else may go and somebody else may go really I mean that's why we're individuals that's why there were 66 books that's why there's thousands of scripture because you correspond the seed that brought you to life amen was put right here before the foundation of the world you cannot if you accepted it here you can't miss it right cuz he saw you accept it there amen amen he was looking down through time he also I'm not getting where I need to go he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the first born among many Brethren moreover whom he did pred now watch this is a string of events that cannot be broken Amen brother Lis the string of events that cannot this scripture cannot be broke and brought in some no it's got to be look moreover whom he did predestinate them he called why did he call because he saw you would respond exactly right and whom he called them he justified amen now be careful with that we'll talk about that I may get into that a little bit later on down the road but be careful with that because remember you can be justified and not be Sanctified right you can be justified and not have the baptism of the Holy Ghost right now here's the part that we thank God that he sent us a prophet to give us Insight because see the Baptist take that as eternal security I'm Justified I'm Justified so I'm all already glorified doesn't matter what I do I can drink smoke cuss to live with somebody else and I'm just saying those words because you know what it may be something else that you have a problem with I just say drink smoke curse and those things cuz a lot of us can relate to that okay now that them he also Justified there's a lot of people because the Bible says believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shalt be saved doesn't say you got to listen to the message or 20 sermons it says believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thou sh be saved there's many people have raised their hands up and say God forgive me of my sins and he just Justified them that's but if you've not been taught any better guess what that other Spirit comes in remember there's two the true Spirit tells you yes I will justify you I wrote it in the word right and then Satan comes in and says okay sir you're fine then I mean I've been to many funeral and I'm not degrading anybody I'm just telling you this is the way that they've been taught the Baptist they we we you go to funerals and the guys hadn't been Church in 50 years but he gave his heart to the Lord when he was nine but he ain't darkened the door and probably lived a hound dog life but the Baptist look back and say he was justified back here and that's okay if you believe that because if you truly believe you've been Justified you'll continue to read that scripture that's right those who he justified he's Sanctified listen folks even in this message it's a tough thing to preach the three stages of Grace right right they just think not even believe on the Lord Jesus Christ believe God sent a Prophet come on in don't cut your hair don't don't don't don't don't don't do do do don't don't don't don't and you're fine no because many people are like the foolish virgin that they got all cleaned up and they said well I must have the Holy Ghost cuz I don't do that anymore no no no no sanctification is a work of the Holy Ghost sanctification cleans you out right right but that place is still empty that's right right the Book of Luke tells us that unclean Spirit goes out drinking smoking cussing running around doing all those things and then you go I must have the Holy Ghost cuz this is not don't bother me anymore see that's where that second Spirit comes in now the really listen the first Spirit we're talking about God's holy spirit cleans you out see it's a work right those who is Justified is also Sanctified that's done by God Almighty Satan C cast out Satan right so there is a holy spirit that cleans you up and sets you aside for service but now if that other Spirit walks in and goes just stay right there y you're fine don't you feel good don't you feel like worshiping don't you feel like going to church every Sunday yeah don't you feel like don't you when you listen to the the message of the hour don't it just give you chills up your spine that's that second spirit because that Spirit right here says it's a string of events right not stopping at any of them that's right he called and whom he called he justified whom he justified we know he say already glorified but there's got to be sanctification in there we know that them he also glorified there's only one group of people going to make that right there amen because the foolish virgin stop after the Sanctified part and most of the people in The Message look at them now you can't tell me that person lives clean for 30 years preaches the message with it all of his heart just like I'm trying to tonight and walks away now folks I'm not talking about a person but if that Spirit takes him away from what I see is light and I have the Holy Ghost that person can't have it right exactly he may be Sanctified but you know how many years he lived Sanctified 30 or 40 years and all of a sudden that unclean spirit says I don't he missed the date over here and he missed a this over here and and he missed it that's not God's spirit now listen here's the difference folks because that same Spirit can say that to you doesn't matter about having doubt because sometimes they may be able to literally prove that brother rown wasn't out there in a certain date I really don't care right amen I don't care cloud that's a sign Believers don't follow signs that sign follows the believer so that sign of that cloud follows me around knowing that God met brother brandham under that cloud in that cloud and then he opened a way he did brother brandham didn't open the way Christ opened the way through William brandham to open the book right to show it to me John and then I had to eat the book right the problem is people don't eat right or you know what Satan slips in and gives them another book oh yeah oh what do you mean uh I don't think he was right in this and lord they're tearing him apart how can the Holy Ghost tear that apart right when we're living by listen this light in US is not Darkness you got to believe that but you got to prove it by the word of God you know why this thing's gone 50 or 60 years this is exactly why exactly amen you look back then with all them people that were with brother Brandon back in the in the 60s they thought he was God oh yeah baptized in his name and you know what he was the closest thing they'll ever see of God without seeing God himself yeah I mean how would and and you got to you got to that's what I'm saying about those folks you say Well they're all lost all going to hell now I'm not telling that's not my business they were under another light they come out of Pentecost and they were looking at the signs of the Prophet not looking at the message with the signs right that doesn't make them lost folks amen cuz they were in another age this age required what the Pentecostal people requir got it but you and I are not in that age right you and I are not in that age you and I are in the age of the book being open Glory that we can look back and see yes God sent a prophet God spoke listen what about a man that walk up to you and say brother Dale you need to go up that Valley not that Valley cuz there'll be nine elk over here and and you can shoot one of them and then he goes over another brother and he said now don't be fishing over here you need to be fishing over here and then he tells them he said I know what you're thinking about me brother you need to stop think You' think that was God almost almost cuz see that's what Jesus did is what Jesus did Jesus told Peter said put your net on that side of the boat put your net on that side of the boat Peter you fishing over here Lord we've been fishing all night we ain't caught a thing he said just throw your net over I mean on the other side of the boat don't tell me all the fish had schooled over here and not over here they were created then you see brother brandham no squirrels all of a sudden there's creative act of God they're squirrels you would think he was God but see they were under that light and that light blinded some of them but you and I come out of that light and we can see and separate being true virgins wise virgins we can separate the two and say God did send a prophet but that God was in that Prophet is in you and me right those who is Justified he's also glorified now if you're born again tonight guess what you're already glorified well that don't make you happy okay I don't make you happy so let's look just a second and touch this crossing of the natural seed because we saw that Genesis 6 vers1 said they took unto them wives of which they chose I want to make that point because remember what are women in the Bible women are churches right women are brides brother Braham said one time he said there's been Brides brides churches Brides brides he said but there's going to come one right exactly now you and I see that's the that's the separating place that's me and you no many brides many churches but he had to put them away in divorcement he had to divorce them because what they were fooling around with another man they were fooling around with another Spirit right Israel went whing after other gods right but they took un them wives of all which they chose sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were fair and they took them wives they took them churches of what they chose denominational churches we'll look at in just a second and the Lord said my spirit shall not always strive with man for that he is also he also is flesh yet his days shall be 120 years there were giants in the earth in those days and after that when the sons of God came in un the daughters of men they bear children to them now remember what does that head up to in in Book of Revelations we got to go from this chapter to to Revelations where there's a and daughters they bear children unto them the same became Mighty Men which were of old men of renown many mighty men have came out of these denominational churches listen Billy Graham and Ora Roberts they were in a denomination but it was their time to do what they were to do amen right right many people in in the message ranks doesn't think that that oral Rob Roberts or Billy Graham had the baptism of the Holy Ghost I disagree I disagree 100% I think they were god-filled men for the time that they could be in they saw what they could see because you know what when you take a prophet though William brandham knowing that was the two men not literally the two men that went to Sodom but the spirit of those two men that went to Sodom and what did they do they blinded the world world he said that was a modern Billy Graham and a modern Oral Roberts they went down to Sodom to this world and blinded now I know they brought out a group of their own but they blinded the other sodomites brother ROM said so they had a place in the words what I'm saying I believe Billy Graham and or Roberts will see them in glory amen but many people tell you no I don't think so but I don't listen to everybody so now look we talk about election look Galatians 3 3:16 Says now to Abraham and to Seed where the promises made he say not un seeds as of many but as of one and to thy seed which is Christ all right so not seeds as of many not as natural seed as we're going to see look these are all natural seed yeah natural people born on Earth by natural sex by by a sex desire accept this man right here and he was that Keystone that could tell me and you that our first birth we can deny that first first birth and take a second birth that's why Jesus said you must be born again Jacob didn't say you must be born again Moses didn't say you must be born again right cuz they didn't know anything about in New Birth blood of bulls and goats is what they were under they were under a covering cuz that's what God told him to do God told Abel make sacrifice not make candy canes and fruit and oranges and pears oh I'm telling you when you walked up though to that I believe he didn't just throw them vegetables up there he put the little red rip oranges over I mean apples over here he put the oranges here he put the bananas and maybe had it look probably look at the Catholic Church look at that thing that John admired in the Book of Revelation the prophet of God said that angel had to turn John away from that cuz he admired that why was beautiful right gold Cathedrals yeah look look at the color have you never watched some of the things on TV from that the Catholics have done Lis has probably been in a church some of you may have been in a cathedral my Heavens the purple is purple the blue is blue the yellow is yellow what it's what appealing to the eye but it's As Dead As the rock that it's laying on God is nowhere that is the mother that is the other Spirit I'm sorry brother but you got Cain and Abel you got Isaac and ishmail you got Jacob and Esau you got Moses and balum you know all the stories behind them I don't have to tell you the story Elijah and Ahab and Jesus and Judas now watch what happened though because this is where it's going to get a little tricky let's look at number four then I'll cuz what happened with remember Cain and Abel was a a complete contrast Cain was of the wicked one Cain left God he went out of the presence of God he killed Abel he was a murderer but watch it when he comes down though Moses and balum balum was only off just a little bit cuz what he said was true oh yeah but what he done to Israel was false that's the only part that's that see getting closer then you got Judas and Jesus for three and a half years Judas walked with Jesus every day preached the gospel cast out Devils Spirits were subject to us it they come back saying and there was Judas right among that group the Bible says in the book of Acts Judas had a part of the ministry right wow see that brought it back close and then you see that like I said before Paul says Grievious wolves are already here John says the spirit of antichrist is already working we read that in first John it had come back so much but watching the book of Acts though will you see it separate again it's what I was looking at the other day it's kind of like a wave but you see how Satan is he Satan is just so slick but he sees that book of Acts that powerful book of Acts boy nothing can stand in front of them folks amen Paul take cloths off of his body and Spirits were cast out we believe that we know that's where prayer CLA came the the not the idea I don't like the idea of prayer cloth it was in the Bible right cloths were on Paul they took cloths off of Paul no doubt they took cloth off of Paul and they said this was laying on the Apostle Paul and this is what he had and let me tell you about Paul Paul had the Holy Ghost so much till he could speak the word and it would happen he well the people said well I believe what he said God healed them on what they of what the problem they had and same way with each one all the you keep that you may need it but that's where this came from was Closs off of Paul right it comes down to now to where we've seen people healed we've seen uh people receive their sight we've seen people have babies we've seen PE whatever A lot of people are you just believe not the prayer cloth is what's behind it right it's the word of God that's behind it but you see now though in the book of Acts though it kind of separated Paul was casting that whatever it was the the that guy Barnabas or not Barnabas but the the sorcerer and all that you can see the separation and then brother randam said the first three Church Ages was there was no denomination in the first three Church ages there was not the pure word of God they were baptized in the name of Jesus Christ they were they were believing there was only one true and living God there was not these now they was little sayings we saw that in the seal book we see that in the seal book book right but what happened with the seal book brother bandam said it's been closed the book's been closed so they couldn't look on what we're looking on now the book was closed after the book of Acts and after Jesus left he came back though in power but what happened was is we'll read it in just a minute n we look preia Nan fathers what happened was it started coming back together you had the powerful word of God first three Church ages a white church but then you also had a white righteous church it was riding in the four horse riders was riding in that same time as a saying right what do you think it's like now how do you think all this got started with brother brandham and all this uh you don't have to go to church just listen to tapes it all started as a say hey don't you that that I don't I don't know if that date's right or brother Brown brother Brown must have been wrong um well I've been burnt so much with all these churches I think I'll just stay home and listen to T what kind of spirit is that right it can't be a Christlike spirit cuz Christ told us to go to church amen Christ told us to listen to a five-fold Ministry amen Christ didn't tell us to stay at home listen to tapes listen we listened to about six tapes the other day going to Illinois and back we as freely as we wanted to we kept mashing play right right that's right so we got six sermons instead of going to a place and sitting in a house and listening to half a sermon one morning and and never mind I'm not going to get off of that get off of that listen if you're deceived with that you are deceived to me that's not the deception of the a of the end time right because if you believe you can sit home and listen to tape and go in a Rapture you are being lied to by whoever told you that that was all right to do and it wasn't that person it was that Spirit motivating that person right everybody got that it was that Spirit motivating that person to tell you that cuz you know what God's got spokesman so does the devil yes sir and he don't POS them as alcoholics that walk through the door well bless God you ain't got to go to church no he sends you a nice guy with a vest on and a beautiful nice set of cuff links and and tells you that I know that we've listened to all this false and I know you've been hurt and you you let's just listen to tapes we know brother Brandon was right so let's just listen listen to what he said well that's okay but that's not all of it right the Bible says me and Jun we're talking about coming to church the Bible is our absolute that's right and I believe that the prophet of God matches the word of God so that makes the message message are absolute but if you take this part out Satan you've took one word right he might get me with something else brother Zach but he will not get me with that one I might let him get deceive me some other way but I'll promise you he will not deceive me with sitting at home and listening to tapes and not going to church right cuz that's not in me so let's look at this right here and studying through many books of the history of the church h two bons you probably studied it in Fox's book of Martyrs and the prean council Nan fathers we're going to cover that in a minute I don't know if I'm going to get to 10 virgins but I will next Tuesday night if I don't you go back and find out that every Spirit In the Land look every every spirit in this land and every cult and everything he covers it all if you go back it began in Genesis right it's coming up though look it's coming up to a blooming time a blossoming time so in other words the seed was planted in Genesis but when is the Harvest time it's now cuz he's letting the seed grow he's letting it show its colors he's letting it get to maturity to show either he's wheat seed or he's cleur you see them come out like Cain and Abel now watch he brings them two together now and watch these two boys come right down to be Judas and Jesus he put right back together all right and just right on through didn't stop there it comes right on out into today this last day where the Antichrist and the Christ spirit so close it had deceive the very elect if possible now we're taught that and we know that's true right pretty good quote I like that one all right let's go we know that's true because what happened look we'll do number five right here leave it right there cuz what happened was if Satan knew he couldn't get God's church with a Doctrine so far off I mean what if somebody walked in here and said okay well you know we can we can have six wives and it doesn't matter we you we let's just go back smoking again and you know that was a it was a a Doctrine in the message we know that it come out of Jamaica some of it was that we were already in the Millennium and so it didn't M this was the soul was in the Millennium so our soul some way was transferred over here into the Millennium yeah now really but this is still here but what we do here is not going to affect over here now that was the doctrine from the message so they go out and divorce their wife get them two or three more this is the truth smoke cigarettes drink beer because it's not going to matter about this one cuz what is inside of is already over here in the Millennium you know so holy and pass now what kind of Doctrine is that going to fool you but you know what it done it fooled a bunch of people to begin with because you know why they didn't have the Holy Ghost right and not having the Holy Ghost you will go to fleshly sensation every time why did they go back and start doing what they used to do right cuz the unclean Spirit went out but when he came back he brought seven other buddies with him that were worse the Bible says than that one which made them very religious but then all of a sudden they come up and say well I you know I can't I can't run around on my wife being under this Doctrine Satan says well that's okay you're already in the Millennium your soul is the the Bible tells you you you've risen sitting in Heavenly places in Christ and even the prophet tells you that we're living you know sitting in Heavenly places we're in another dimension yeah so it doesn't matter what this guy does and then the flesh goes oh okay all right yeah back to what we used to do before now the Holy Ghost will not do that right so don't think that's a true Doctrine I told them you know many times before I told you I said let me have one of them guys I'm going to take him down to the zoo and throw him into the lion's den and find out if we're in the Millennium cuz the Bible says that they'll eat grass they wouldn't they'd find out real quick we wasn't in the Millennium but that was a Doctrine and people believed it and churches yes this just find funny was it take throw that Jokers over in the lon there and say eat grass that's when they that other spirit their Spirits would divide but see you see how that that's deceiving because what did it do they didn't have the Holy Ghost as a TI poost how many times have you heard a sermon that you didn't see that was right how many times that thing down inside of you go something's wrong with that something something's not right with that you know what that's that Holy Ghost right that's in your soul not just in your spirit realm that's why as Bible saying the other night you can have the baptism of the Holy Ghost every day of your life on your spirit now and die and go to hell and your spirit is memory reason conscious affection imagination you can have all that and you can still die and go to hell why because the inside guy is still black right the people that say have I not done this have I not done that have I not cast out Devils have I not done these Mighty Works they had the Holy Ghost on their spirit and God worked through that through them and I would say people miraculous were healed and all these different things cuz he said he cast out devils and all these different things but that inside guy was still dirty right so let's get right here and then I'll tell you what we'll quit and we'll take up the 10 virgins next week because you your 10 virgins are there's your two Spirits right you wise and your foolish there's your wise spirit and your foolish Spirit but they all come under the framework remember what brother Brown said the framework of the Christian Church a foolish virgin is in the framework of the Christian church right cuz he's Sanctified that's right people out there don't know anything but people out there think sanctification and they're done they're saved and all this other things listen folks I'm telling you when I got when I come to the Lord and I ask him to forgive me of my sins I believe he did that but I was well taught in that I knew that when I went to sanctification and I quit dipping I'll just tell you this I quit dipping I quit lusting I didn't smoke any but I dipped a lot I quit drinking and there several other things that you don't need to know about they were all cast out but I knew I didn't have the Holy Ghost sister Trudy I knew that was not the Holy Ghost but now 99% of the people that have never been taught would have said I am now born again and Satan would have said yep you're right yeah he would have stepped right in there and said what yep yep you're born again you listen to a couple tapes and go to church and Nod your head every once in a while no but when you have that experience though when that thing gets down on the inside of the inside and start speaking and when you start reading God starts putting that puzzle together just like this and when you not just see that ladies don't wear pants no you go to the Bible you see what spirit is behind that all the other spirits that are behind these things and then you I told you I could explain serpent seed when I was 14 years old I knew it wasn't an apple it just made sense what it was I was 14 I was going through puberty I knew what it was I knew what my problem was right but see I only had the natural part brother Brown said a lot of these things is just ability to read that's right right but go 20 years later now I know that that serpent seed's still working right here and I know why the two Spirits had to be here and I know all this and I could put the quotes together and I could see how God was doing things because remember with the baptism of the Holy Ghost you have Insight that you didn't have before everybody okay with that see that's why I know I moved into the baptism of the Holy Ghost is because not only did I quit those things I even got tested on them certain times I'll tell you remember one time before I was going down the road talking to this friend of mine and I mean he was talking about hunting and we were just all excited about going and I almost said that word but you remember my testimony I was driving the car and it felt like it felt like the airbag went off yeah I was fixing to say the s word and when it did Brother John something went and when it hit me right there I went oh yeah that's all I said I couldn't say no more yeah God wasn't going to let me do it cuz I knew that word was coming out slipping up I didn't mean to say it but just caught up in a moment but when he went like that right there it's like I went and you know what I did I told my buddy I said I got to go and I hung that phone up and I cried like a baby I said God you said that you'd take that away from me and even in a test even in a test I was going to say it listen folks brother random said I was going to shoot that boy I was going to shoot that bull I was going to shoot myself you see what kind of spirit can get on you but what happened though that inside of the inside Glory that's what held exctly brother R did your religion did you hold on to your religion he said no he said My Religion help me amen be still and know that I am god let's read this quote right here and then we'll stop musicians get ready to come the pergan church age Jeffersonville watch this cuz we're going to talk about the white righteous church cuz you got to with Matthew 25 talking about the kingdom of God being like an under 10 virgins so let's listen to what the prophet said now in doing this remember the book of Acts it was it was it was just rotness and then you had the great powerful book of Acts through irenius and Martin you had many signs wonders and great things going on the pure word of God was being spread around the world so you had that separation again right but watch what happened at n you got Constantine brother Brown which said was a scoundrel he was no Christian worldly guy he brings church and state together and he marries them in a union that started every denomination by name and every doc false Doctrine started right here right but watch the true church went to NAA to try to stop it but watch this right here now in doing this they Consolidated and made the early form the early Catholic church later then at the first great Nan Council now remember they one at 325 ad and one at 606 it took them 300 years to develop this from a saying to a deed to a Doctrine everybody got that that's what happened in the church age I mean in the seal book brother R said it started as a saying became a deed became a Doctrine this is the saying part the great Nan Council had taken place in ad 325 see that was 300 years after Christ left look what happened all of them was brought together the Bishops and fathers of the Christian faith that's us remember we're supposed to be turned back to the faith of our faith of the fathers right so here was the Christian fathers was brought together at NAA that's the reason it's called the Nia Council in ad 3:25 and about 15500 delegates came to the convention or the council about 1500 delegates and the leoty outnumbered the Bishops 5 to one yeah wow in the delegation but yet through the nicians the cold Formals in other words that other spirit and Constantine's political political plan they outvoted the true church talk about election they outvoted the true church and won the Victory and issued in Bishops and holy orders of men taking the Holy Spirit from the meeting and placing it upon Bishops Cardinals popes and so forth here it comes back together and you're not going to be able to tell any difference now because everybody if you read kids if you had any kind of History lesson Constantine was this great warrior Constantine was this great crossback I mean he he was this great Christian Warrior listen truth be known he's the one that started killing 68 million of our people right cuz they wasn't conformed to this new idea this new this new Seed doctrine so he killed them that's why you had your first church age or your first horse rider was a white righteous church he HD himself then what happened in the fourth Church age he became a red horse right physically killed 68 million of our people under what under not that well we're Christians and I mean we're barbarians and you're Christians so we're just going to kill you no it was Christians fighting Christians is what the world looked that right but what was it brother Brown said he said to look at him and said if you don't believe our Holy Father and you don't believe our Bishops we're going to kill you recant or die right right and they didn't recant and that's why 68 million of them of our people like I said the Holy Ghost filled people got killed in the Dark Ages by what that other spirit because look the Holy Spirit don't fight the Holy Spirit you can't do that exactly right like brother BR said bride does not fight bride right but the red horse and you see the White Horse the red horse the black horse musicians come and The Pale Horse listen it was four powers but one man exactly he gets off of this horse and gets on another right his name is the devil right his name is a demon right let's stand our feet I we'll get into the 10 virgins next Tuesday that okay everybody all right with that had a good time tonight you have a good time tonight amen amen amen all right listen June just got a message from Sister Janet Helm I don't know this person but an urgent prayer request for Kim Johnson's son who was 22 years old to come oh that her well her son either may have taken his life or tried to oh so not sure of the outcome yet so let's pray real quick that the Lord will intervene on that situation dear heavenly father we pray Lord as a congregation Lord we just heard your word father and we know that it's true and your word is true father so now Lord take that word and the power behind it and send it send it to Sister Kim's son Lord that you'll raise him up Lord and give him a chance Lord at least to accept you father and Lord just bring him out of whatever situation he's in something caused that boy to do that some Spirit some evil demon tried to cause him to take his life father because we know you don't ever ever want people to take their life father because you are the Prince of Peace you are the king of life and we pray Lord in Jesus name that you'll intervene in that situation Lord in Jesus name amen amen I was thinking the other day we were listening to brother brandom and I thought you know Lord there's a power folks and and and I'm not we can't conjure anything up we're not conjurers that's what the devil does but there's a power laying in us that we're not using right there's something L there but there's something stopping it right there's something holding it back there's something that we've just not kind of got over that little hump cuz brother Bram said we go to come into speaking condition now what is speaking condition knowing what he wants and when he wants it right not what you want exactly cuz see Power without character is satanic you'll say the wrong thing like Elisha did and 42 kids got killed because you know what God honored the word of Elisha CU he was in a position listen folks we going to come to a place to where God is going to be satisfied with what we're going to when listen it's just got to be the same way when Adam was in the garden and he started saying elephant lion bear tiger God was going saying the same thing I'm saying the same thing I'm saying the same thing that's my son he's saying the same thing I'm saying amen that's what we got to come back to and Jesus never had a thought outside of what the father gave him right oh he may have had human thoughts but he said I do nothing right I do nothing exactly nothing without the father telling me what to do he was so in tune within the man inside of him listen folks you and I got the same Holy Ghost right and it can do the same thing for me and you let's pray that this thing is going to break I was thinking the other day just one more thought think with me this whole year has been nothing but about flesh that's right this guy the guy it's been all the whole 12 months has been nothing but flesh moaning and groaning right with the viruses and even not the viruses but you know what there's people that that are um being affected and not even the virus hitting them because of suicides that went up and all these different things cuz people are losing their mind people can't get regular I mean how many of you have you had to cancel just general things you had to go to the doctor for cuz I believe in going to doctors if you got something wrong with your car you take it to the mechanic right if you got something wrong with your body you go see the mechanic not even crying out to God you go see right but this year has been all about our natural human body exactly trying our best to make it through this year alive in our Humanity in our human body so folks there's only one thing left for the bride and that's a spiritual Revival that's one that's the spirit is going to take over the flesh yeah and something Supernatural is going to happen this year coming up you just wait and see you wait and see we've had Satan has listen what's Satan got Satan has tried to get in the soul he's tried to get in your soul he's tried to get in your soul he can't get in so he says oh flesh I I'll make them Curse God I'll make them get on their hands and knees and say there's not a God or God don't answer his prayer brother Claude you know he called had those gall stones he said I was or yeah g Stones he said I laying on the floor of the hospital begging God to kill me okay begging God to die and he said God just give him peace they didn't take it away but you know what he went he's through it right he's through it now back preaching he's back doing what he needs to do yeah so listen it's not what we overcome it's how we overcome it Hallelujah and how do we overcome by the word of God and the testimony of Jesus Christ that's what the Bible says the Saints overcome so listen Satan's been beating on this guy right here all year yours and mine but he can't get that inside guy so what else has he got to work on he ain't got nothing else to work on if he's got the bride as low as she can get and people are passing away what does that matter to us we're bride right we're bride Satan can play all he wants to with this guy but when he can't play with this guy he ain't got none of el left so take that and let that drop down in side inside of you and say hey satan Body Spirit Soul you can't work on my soul you can't have my body cuz God's done brought us through all these things we're standing here alive right so he's going to work on that memories and conscious effects and Imagination but what are you and I going to do we're going to walk right up at statue of a perfect man and say no no no that memory is your memory Satan that memory is not God's memory that reasoning is not your memory Satan no we know what God Said our conscience and all these different that's the only thing he's got to play with folks he's gotten brother brandham said Satan cannot touch your life until God is finished with you exactly right so you know what if you're standing here looking at me
