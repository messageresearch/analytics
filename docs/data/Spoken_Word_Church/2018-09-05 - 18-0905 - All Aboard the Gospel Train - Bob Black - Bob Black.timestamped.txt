[2:19] bride more and more closer and closer
[2:21] together until we get to a honing just a
[2:24] razor-edged
[2:25] and we see it coming to past and today
[2:27] Lord Jesus we just observed that the
[2:30] signs of the times and the the
[2:32] revelation of the our Lord and we're so
[2:34] grateful to be able to live in this time
[2:35] and I pray God that you'll just come

[2:59] bless your word we ask in the name the
[3:01] Lord Jesus Christ amen
[3:07] Acts chapter 1 verse 12 to 14 then
[3:13] returned they unto Jerusalem from the
[3:15] mount called Olivet which is from
[3:18] Jerusalem a Sabbath day's journey
[3:20] and when they were coming and they went
[3:22] up into an upper room and I've got that
[3:25] highlighted in red because that's the
[3:27] really the key point they went up in the
[3:29] upper room because that was word you
[3:32] know Jesus told him to go to Jerusalem
[3:33] that was there waiting point there they
[3:36] were up there waiting for something to
[3:38] happen where abode both Peter and James
[3:41] and John and Andrew Philip and Thomas
[3:43] Bartholomew and Matthew James the son of
[3:46] Alphaeus and Cylons and Lotus and Judas
[3:49] the brother of James these all continued
[3:52] with one prayer Accord in prayer and
[3:54] supplication with the women and Mary the
[3:57] mother of Jesus with his brethren you
[4:00] may be seated little Bliss's word so
[4:10] here they are if I could just set a
[4:12] little background they've here they are
[4:14] up in the upper room and you know really
[4:16] if you want to put this into context
[4:18] they really might not be fully aware of
[4:21] what's about to take place they've gone
[4:23] through all these all the they've seen
[4:24] all of the different events unfold that
[4:26] were very surprising and very unexpected
[4:30] and everything and you know if you want
[4:32] to go back and look at think about how
[4:34] they had walked and and talked with
[4:36] Jesus for three and a half years and
[4:38] been with him as they saw him perform
[4:40] wonders and saw him live his life out
[4:43] and saw him do all of these things and
[4:45] then he gave them the Great Commission
[4:47] and kind of gave him all of these
[4:49] promises and I want to maybe think
[4:51] tonight about all the promises that you
[4:53] have in the Bible and these promises
[4:56] maybe represent the night if I want to
[4:58] just kind of painting a picture in your
[5:00] mind these promises represent a gospel
[5:03] train a locomotive if you will that's
[5:06] sitting on the track and we want to see
[5:08] how we can put this locomotive this
[5:10] gospel train into action well the
[5:13] disciples had seen this locomotive in
[5:15] action they had seen the Train in action
[5:17] as it walked the shores of Galilee and
[5:19] they saw Jesus perform all these things
[5:21] and live they saw him for example or
[5:24] maybe at first heard the stories about
[5:26] how after the Spirit fell on him and
[5:28] there on the River Jordan he went into
[5:30] the wilderness and was tempted by the
[5:32] Evelynn how he reacted to the devil and
[5:34] knew exactly what to say to him and knew
[5:36] how to how to respond and and and knew
[5:40] right how to put the devil in his place
[5:41] they had seen that great faith that he
[5:44] had how he stepped out on the water and
[5:46] he walked on the water and something
[5:47] held him up and when he called Peter
[5:49] Peter was able to walk on the water with
[5:51] him and to him and they saw how he would
[5:54] curse the fruit tree for not bearing
[5:56] forth fruit and they they remembered how
[5:58] God had had with his spoken word he
[6:01] spoke to that fruit tree and the fruit
[6:04] tree had to obey his command and then
[6:06] Jesus would come and tell them the very
[6:09] strange saying that if use if you have
[6:12] enough faith if faith is a mustard seeds
[6:15] a little grit a little grain of faith of
[6:17] a mustard seed something that can't be
[6:19] corrupted if you speak to this mountain
[6:21] be moved and don't doubt in your heart
[6:23] then it'll have to obey you and as we go
[6:26] along as I recite all these these things
[6:29] think about the disciples up there in
[6:31] that Upper Room were remembering all
[6:32] these things and thinking about how that
[6:34] they these things were something that
[6:36] was in Jesus Christ life they were in
[6:39] that locomotive and now Jesus was gone
[6:42] and it's time for that what was what was
[6:45] manifested in his life to be made
[6:47] manifest in another body of flesh in a
[6:51] group of people that were sitting there
[6:53] in that upper room you think about how
[6:56] how Jesus manifested virtue now he when
[6:59] that woman came up and touched his
[7:01] garment he turned and he said just I
[7:02] know something happened here everybody
[7:05] stop for a second because somebody
[7:07] touched me and she reached she reached
[7:09] out and touched him by faith believing
[7:11] that there was something in that man
[7:13] that was special something that she
[7:15] could pull something out of and you
[7:18] remember how Jesus talked to the woman
[7:19] at the well and said I'll give you well
[7:21] Springs of everlasting life I'll give
[7:24] you water that you don't know anything
[7:25] about you say you worship over here and
[7:28] you worship at the mountain and the Jews
[7:30] worship in Jerusalem but I'll tell you
[7:31] where one of these days people are gonna
[7:33] know where to worship they'll worship in
[7:35] spirit and in truth it won't be in any
[7:37] particular place but they'll be worship
[7:39] they'll be worshiping the truth think
[7:42] about how Jesus with the Pharisees came
[7:44] to him and they they approached him and
[7:46] with the trickery and things and trying
[7:48] to trying to put something over on him
[7:50] and saying whoa who's in script you know
[7:52] who should we pay taxes to who should we
[7:55] do this to and and he turned around and
[7:57] he knew exactly how to respond and he
[7:58] said well whose inscription is on the
[8:00] coin and no matter how they approached
[8:02] him he always knew what the right
[8:04] response was why because not only did he
[8:07] have faith but he also had virtue and he
[8:09] also had knowledge he was the stature of
[8:11] a perfect man because he was that
[8:14] perfect man he was he was the the
[8:17] masterpiece they're walking on the
[8:19] shores of Galilee this man had had the
[8:23] kind of temperance where when they drug
[8:24] into the cross they could beat him and
[8:27] spit on his face and he wouldn't react
[8:29] he would just allow himself to be led
[8:31] like a lamb to the slaughter led to the
[8:34] cross allow himself to go through all of
[8:36] that punishment for you and I looking at
[8:39] cute looking at you and his mind's eye
[8:41] realizing that the things that he went
[8:43] through those things that he suffered
[8:44] were for your sake and I want to say to
[8:47] you tonight that that is real brotherly
[8:49] kindness well you can lay down your life
[8:51] for somebody else and say I'm willing to
[8:54] I'm willing to die for this person I'm
[8:56] willing to do whatever whatever it takes
[8:58] that this person could enter into the
[8:59] kingdom that this person can realize the
[9:02] benefits of the promises of God patience
[9:08] where he he dealt with all the disciples
[9:10] and walked with him and he said finally
[9:12] do you now believe oh you of little
[9:14] faith do you finally believe and he
[9:16] walked with him and talked with him and
[9:18] it kind of kind of you know you know
[9:20] encouraged him along the way and helped
[9:23] him out when they stumbled helped him to
[9:24] answer their questions even when they
[9:26] would come to him and say we you you
[9:28] spoke about this when you were preaching
[9:29] to the pharisees and sadducees and i
[9:31] didn't quite understand what you meant
[9:33] and he dealt with him and he and he kept
[9:35] talking to him and till finally they got
[9:37] it was just a mental conception just the
[9:39] mental intellectual kind understanding
[9:41] and then think about godliness when he
[9:46] said who do you say that I the Son of
[9:48] Man am and he was able to identify
[9:50] himself as God in flesh
[9:52] because he knew who he was he knew who
[9:54] he knew he wasn't just another prophet
[9:57] he knew when he talked to those
[9:59] Pharisees and Sadducees in the temple
[10:01] when he was just another boy he knew who
[10:03] he was
[10:03] he didn't come with any kind of you know
[10:06] confusion about what was happening what
[10:08] was taking place and he was able to
[10:10] respond to them but just as a little
[10:11] young bored within a way that would
[10:13] confuse them and confound them because
[10:16] he was God in flesh do you think about
[10:18] all this was wrapped up in this man and
[10:20] this was the locomotive that they they
[10:24] up there in the upper room how are we
[10:26] how are we going to make this work how
[10:29] are we going to make this work think
[10:33] about mark chapter 16 verse 15 and 19
[10:35] then maybe they would reflect back to
[10:37] and think about how Jesus Jesus told
[10:41] them that they were supposed to have
[10:42] things happened in their life they were
[10:45] supposed to have power to cast out
[10:46] Devils now I just want to read it here
[10:49] for a second so it really sinks in and
[10:51] he said unto them go ye into all the
[10:53] world and preach the gospel to every
[10:55] creature preach the gospel to every
[10:57] creature because the same when Jesus he
[11:00] went into the temple and took took the
[11:02] scroll of Isaiah and said I the Spirit
[11:04] of the Lord has on me to preach the
[11:05] deliverance of the captive and all those
[11:07] things you know somebody else after
[11:09] Jesus left the earth somebody else has
[11:11] the preach the deliverance of the
[11:12] captain somebody else has the preach the
[11:14] delivers to us so that the priests
[11:17] preach this Gospel message that's why
[11:19] I'm calling it the gospel train what's
[11:22] what what will power this gospel train
[11:26] he said he that believeth and is
[11:29] baptized shall be saved but he that
[11:31] believeth not shall be damned and these
[11:34] signs shall follow them that believe in
[11:36] my name shall they cast out Devils they
[11:38] shall speak with new tongues and I want
[11:41] to declare tonight that I still believe
[11:43] these things I still stand for that
[11:45] these signs shall follow them they
[11:46] believe because the Word of God is still
[11:49] active today he's Hebrews 13:8 he's
[11:52] still able to perform signs and wonders
[11:54] like the children of Israel when they
[11:56] wandered through Egypt they had the
[11:57] pillar of fire and their midst they were
[11:59] led by the prophet of God and signs and
[12:01] one
[12:02] could not help but follow them because
[12:03] they were believers when they got to the
[12:05] River Jordan it had done Foley had to
[12:08] pass before then because they were
[12:10] believers and they had the word with
[12:12] them these signs shall follow them they
[12:14] believe in my name they shall cast out
[12:16] devils do you believe that I you know I
[12:18] believe that the preaching of the word
[12:20] is what cast out devils your sanctified
[12:22] by the hearing of the word and the devil
[12:24] will leave you but what if you're in a
[12:26] situation where listen what if you had
[12:28] the devil has got you in such a
[12:29] situation where you're slithering on the
[12:31] floor you just can't react there's a
[12:33] power that's in the preaching of the
[12:35] gospel there's a power that there in
[12:37] Saints to make that devil get up and
[12:39] leave to make that thing get out I
[12:42] believe in the power of the gospel I
[12:44] believe in the power of the resurrected
[12:46] Jesus because sitting there tonight is a
[12:48] witness that Jesus Christ is not still
[12:50] in the grave but he's alive and he's
[12:52] rose that is really he's risen again it
[12:55] is the rising of the Sun his rose again
[12:58] he's not still in the ground but he's
[13:00] living in the lives of people because
[13:02] this gospel train is moving that's what
[13:04] I think I want to talk about tonight is
[13:06] not just not just that the gospel train
[13:08] needs to move but I believe it is moving
[13:11] I believe that the gospel train is what
[13:13] started on the day of Pentecost and then
[13:16] never stopped it'll never stop until it
[13:18] reaches its destination because jesus
[13:20] said I go to prepare a place for you
[13:22] that where I am you may be also
[13:24] and that's train and go stop until you
[13:26] get to your destination and that's where
[13:28] he is they shall take up serpents and if
[13:35] they drink any deadly thing it shall not
[13:37] hurt them they shall lay hands on the
[13:39] sick and they shall recover I believe
[13:45] that because I've seen it now I haven't
[13:47] seen taking up serpents and things but I
[13:49] believe that there's a life in that down
[13:51] on the inside of a believer that's able
[13:54] just like with Paul that to repair all
[13:56] the things that you know what we're
[13:58] telling about the story of the brother
[14:00] branham's pastor when he was just
[14:01] starting out how he took up that
[14:03] somebody said well you had a had a vial
[14:06] of opposing what her sitting up there on
[14:08] the pulpit and said if the gospel is
[14:10] true come up and drink this and prove it
[14:12] and he went up there and proved
[14:13] and he drunken down that whatever it was
[14:16] some kind of vile poison and they start
[14:18] a little revival in that church why
[14:19] because the people saw that the promises
[14:22] that are written in this Bible they were
[14:24] somebody was able to make a move
[14:25] somebody was able to make them to
[14:27] believe it enough to see that gospel
[14:30] locomotive moving that gospel train was
[14:32] moving it's real and it's live and it's
[14:34] filled by the Word of God look at my
[14:37] getting my head myself so then after the
[14:41] Lord had spoken unto them he was
[14:45] received up into heaven and said on the
[14:47] right hand of God and now now he's off
[14:51] the scene so now how does that gospel
[14:54] locomotive gonna get started you know
[14:56] they were up there in that upper room
[14:58] thinking that all of these things you
[15:00] know you know you think think about this
[15:02] picture now think about this this
[15:04] locomotive sitting on the track they had
[15:07] heard all the word they had heard it
[15:10] laid out exactly how everything should
[15:11] be all these things that would be in the
[15:14] moment quicken but for now it was
[15:16] sitting on the track maybe maybe if you
[15:18] were to walk up to it and put your hand
[15:20] on it we cold to the touch
[15:22] and you'd feel like the coldness of an
[15:24] eye you know you wonder sometimes if
[15:27] that's how a lot of Christians are today
[15:28] they don't have a fire down on the
[15:30] inside they don't have
[15:31] something-something ball and they don't
[15:32] have steam on the inside because the
[15:34] Bible says that this gospel locomotive
[15:37] that I'm talking about it's supposed to
[15:39] have fire and pillars of smoke it's
[15:41] supposed to have fire on the inside it's
[15:43] supposed to be fast and it's supposed to
[15:45] keep getting faster and faster and
[15:47] faster it's supposed to be something as
[15:49] speedy and you know you know if you look
[15:51] at a real locomotive you know they said
[15:54] they only had maybe five or ten
[15:55] horsepower but because of the way that
[15:57] it was built it didn't need much fuel to
[16:00] run fast with just a little bit of feel
[16:03] that can run 200 miles per hour across
[16:05] the plains and that's how that gospel
[16:08] locomotives supposed to be it's supposed
[16:09] to be something on the inside burning
[16:12] something feeling it something to keep
[16:14] it warm so that when you get up next to
[16:15] it you can get warm from it not not cold
[16:18] like painting words on the page where
[16:20] you don't you know that doesn't happen
[16:22] you
[16:23] get warm from a painted fire you gotta
[16:25] have something that's real cold to the
[16:31] touch unmoving you know I think many
[16:35] times people people want to see you know
[16:38] the Bible says that the whole earth is
[16:39] waiting growling for the manifestation
[16:41] of the sons of God why because the whole
[16:44] earth wants to see a moving train they
[16:46] want to see the gospel in action they
[16:48] don't want to just hear somebody talk
[16:50] about it then I want to declare to you
[16:52] tonight that I'm not here just to talk
[16:53] about the token I'm here to manifest it
[16:56] I'm not here just to talk about the
[16:57] things that are written in the Bible
[16:59] I'm here to manifest it I believe it
[17:01] it's manifest in time you can see if you
[17:03] go out on the street the things that it
[17:05] is manifest in time the things that are
[17:07] done in secret or now made open the
[17:09] secret desires of people are made open
[17:11] openly declared where everybody can see
[17:13] it secret things on the internet on
[17:15] Facebook Instagram things are being made
[17:17] public everywhere and the secret desires
[17:20] the bride are now being made public
[17:22] they're being made manifest what you can
[17:24] look at it and see it moving you can
[17:27] look at it and see something happening
[17:29] in the Bride of Christ unmoving no fire
[17:33] on the inside no sound of the whistle oh
[17:36] goodness
[17:38] and you know you know if you think about
[17:40] the whistle how there's there's
[17:42] something that the train is supposed to
[17:45] be moving and that's where the steam
[17:46] goes the steam was supposed to move the
[17:48] train but you know something comes out
[17:50] of that whistle too and I believe that
[17:52] what comes out of the whistle was is a
[17:54] blessing that the bride receives she
[17:56] gets something to understand because the
[17:59] move and the fire begins to move down on
[18:01] the inside something's got to come out
[18:02] and she starts to say I believe the
[18:05] promises of God I believe it let it come
[18:07] to pass and she begins to confess the
[18:09] word and move forward based upon her
[18:11] confession and last of all if you want
[18:16] to think about this little gossip gospel
[18:18] locomotive sitting there on the track
[18:21] the wheels are supposed to be moving
[18:22] it's supposed to be turning because as
[18:25] we kind of go through this message
[18:27] tonight what good does it do you if it's
[18:29] wonderful to have fire on the inside
[18:31] it's wonderful to have steam and
[18:33] everything but the gospel locomotive
[18:35] ain't meant to just sit
[18:36] on the tracks the wheels are supposed to
[18:38] be turning its supposed to be moving its
[18:40] supposed to be an action and so they're
[18:44] sitting up there how are we supposed to
[18:47] make this work and that's what a lot of
[18:50] people do sitting in churches sitting at
[18:52] homes I think how do we make how am I
[18:54] supposed to make this work when I read
[18:56] the Bible how am I supposed to make it
[18:58] work how could I do it and that's our
[19:00] problem we try to make it work we try to
[19:03] when you got some kind of problem in
[19:05] your life that you want to get rid of
[19:06] alcohol or or you know the long list
[19:11] that we could go through all the
[19:13] different things that beset different
[19:15] people and plagued them and and keep
[19:17] them in bondage you chained down to the
[19:19] earth chained and bond is your sin but
[19:23] you know the gospel is supposed to free
[19:25] you from all that stuff and that's the
[19:27] that's the point I want to make tonight
[19:28] is that is the gospel that will deliver
[19:31] you it is the gospel that will move you
[19:34] you can't do it on your own you can't do
[19:36] it by yourself what we need to do is
[19:39] learn how to yield ourselves to the Holy
[19:41] Spirit so that God can do it what we
[19:44] need to do is take a hold of God's Word
[19:46] and just believe it so that a fire can
[19:48] be kindled because that's all you can do
[19:50] what more can you do there's nothing you
[19:52] can do if your own self listen I'm
[19:55] getting on something tonight
[19:57] let's I'm just a borderline meddling a
[19:59] little bit because people people get in
[20:04] it you get it in your head that to get
[20:05] virtue that's something you got to do
[20:07] first before you can get virtue before
[20:10] you can have brotherly kindness or
[20:12] something you got to do first and then
[20:14] once you got that out of the way then
[20:16] you can have brotherly kindness they
[20:18] nothing you can do the only thing you
[20:20] need to do is get the fire kindled the
[20:23] fire is the most important thing of this
[20:25] whole thing because everything comes out
[20:27] of the fire everything originates with
[20:29] the fire if you get the fire started
[20:31] everything else will take care of itself
[20:33] everything else will be automatic after
[20:36] you get the fire started it's all
[20:38] automatic so when brother branham in
[20:41] this quote that I'm going to read was
[20:42] down in
[20:43] I am looking at this old cold train
[20:45] sitting on the track and he said what
[20:48] will make this move that's the answer
[20:51] let me let me read this quote he said
[20:57] it's faith by experience I was over one
[21:01] time at a railroad yard and they just
[21:03] made one of these new Zephyr engines and
[21:04] train and I had the privilege of going
[21:06] through the Train oh it looks so pretty
[21:09] and all of us aluminum works in it I
[21:12] went into the dining room and oh it
[21:14] looks so pretty I went into the Pullman
[21:16] into all the cars and the seats were so
[21:18] pushed and looked so pretty
[21:19] and he actually I skipped over you'll
[21:23] notice there's just 29 this is 31 so
[21:25] there is a paragraph missing sorry about
[21:28] that
[21:28] look at this old train as I went through
[21:31] it I said when's it going to move can't
[21:34] it move my answer to you tonight is it
[21:38] can move you just got to get some fire
[21:41] in there so let's go to took quote to
[21:43] which just kind of continues this from
[21:45] paragraph 31 he said I looked at this
[21:47] old train as I went through with it I
[21:48] said when's it going to move can it move
[21:51] said no sir I said I'd like to take a
[21:54] little ride he said it can't move I said
[21:57] why he said there's no fire in the
[22:00] engine that's what's the matter with the
[22:02] church today it's all plush up and
[22:05] decorated up with no fire in the engine
[22:07] you can only move by the fire Oh what we
[22:10] need today is some more Holy Ghost and
[22:12] fire that's what we need today we need
[22:15] if you get Holy Ghost and fire down on
[22:17] the engine they learn to take care of
[22:19] the fire the pillars are smoke it'll
[22:21] take care of the speed and the power
[22:22] it'll put something in that locomotive
[22:24] that where it can pull every promise of
[22:26] God it can even take care of this
[22:28] brother locomotives problems it can pull
[22:30] them along with it if there's a local
[22:32] motor that's broke down a little bit on
[22:34] the side of the tracks
[22:35] pull that locomotive that's working real
[22:37] good up next to it I pull that brothers
[22:39] burdens alone that's how we're supposed
[22:41] to be like the gospel pulls one another
[22:43] alone and you can't do it yourself which
[22:49] is what Matthew 536 SC said thou canst
[22:52] not make one hair white or black but we
[22:55] think in our mind we think we can do
[22:57] think we can increase our stature if we
[22:59] just struggle enough if we just if we
[23:01] just pray it up you know let me get on
[23:04] prayer a little bit because you know
[23:05] really sometimes when you get down and
[23:08] begin to pray and fast and things you
[23:10] can almost work yourself away from the
[23:12] things why because instead of just
[23:14] taking it by faith you're waiting for
[23:16] something to happen if is unless this
[23:19] particular thing happens unless I feel
[23:21] something or I see something or
[23:23] something like that happens and I say I
[23:25] can't quite grab a hold to it but maybe
[23:29] that's a lesson for us ministers to you
[23:31] know today you know you sit back there
[23:34] and well is it gonna happen tonight am I
[23:37] gonna be able to get it what get myself
[23:38] out of the way is it gonna be as the
[23:40] locomotives gonna run well tonight and
[23:43] what you have to do is just check out
[23:45] all the word the Word of God and just
[23:47] believe it just accept it I let God turn
[23:50] loose and let God grab a hold to it take
[23:52] the turn loose and let God do it but
[23:54] because it's not by our efforts it's not
[23:57] by that's that's the problem with
[23:59] preachers they get up behind the pulpit
[24:01] and they try to help they try to help
[24:03] God out God don't need no help what God
[24:07] needs us to do is get out of way and let
[24:09] him do it
[24:11] and that's that's a lesson for in every
[24:14] aspect of our lives you start worrying
[24:16] about things and start fretting about
[24:18] your future of your children and the
[24:20] future of what's going to happen that
[24:21] you know we need I think we need to take
[24:23] a lesson from Moses mama when she just
[24:25] took him and put him in the little in
[24:27] the little basket and set him loose on
[24:28] the water and said Lord he's yours now
[24:30] your deal with him and that's the best
[24:33] way to handle it if she would have kept
[24:35] a hold of him and trashy just meddled
[24:37] with the situation then before long the
[24:39] guards would have showed up and there
[24:40] wouldn't have been a Moses but she just
[24:42] took him and put him in that little
[24:43] basket and set him loose just turn it
[24:46] loose and let God have a hold of it but
[24:48] you know these these brothers and
[24:50] sisters and all of them up in that upper
[24:53] room the one thing that they had right
[24:55] the one thing that they had going for
[24:57] him is their what they were a band the
[24:59] word of the Lord where Jesus had told
[25:01] him to go to Jerusalem wait for the
[25:03] power wait for something to happen
[25:08] because what were they doing was
[25:11] upper room really now I know I'm
[25:13] dramatizing a little bit I might be
[25:14] taking a little artistic license here
[25:16] but what if I want I want to I want to
[25:19] paint for your picture up in that upper
[25:22] room what they were doing was they were
[25:24] standing on the platform they were
[25:26] standing on the platform of the train
[25:28] station waiting for the train to come
[25:31] and this because what was it it's
[25:33] injunction time junction time a judge
[25:36] train Junction is when you got two
[25:38] tracks and one ends up going another
[25:40] direction one hundreds up going the
[25:43] direction that you want to take and I've
[25:45] been in that trouble many times when
[25:47] I've been down in Atlanta and I'd be
[25:50] reading the message or something and
[25:51] lose track of time and before long I
[25:53] realized that I had missed the last
[25:55] Junction and I was going the wrong way I
[25:58] was going away that I didn't expect and
[26:00] I had to maybe add in another 30 minutes
[26:02] to get off the train turn back around
[26:04] get on the right train and go in the way
[26:06] that I was supposed to go so you got to
[26:09] be careful when you get to junction time
[26:10] because God's fixing to take a turn
[26:13] that's junction that was a junction time
[26:14] when I arena scam on the scene those a
[26:17] junction time when Martin came on the
[26:19] scene and there's a junction time in
[26:21] this last day when there was
[26:23] denominational systems and they
[26:25] everything they were just kept marching
[26:26] on the way that they thought was correct
[26:28] but God sent a prophet on the scene to
[26:31] turn make a little turn here and if
[26:33] you're not ready for that Junction whoo
[26:35] you won't take that turn right so you've
[26:38] got to be on the right platform you've
[26:40] got to be looking for the right thing
[26:41] and that's the way to get the fire
[26:43] started is to be there at the right
[26:45] place at the right time and the right
[26:48] place at the right time just so there's
[26:49] no confusion is this a message of the
[26:52] hour this is the platform that you're
[26:53] supposed to be in because if you're not
[26:55] on a platform then you won't you'll miss
[26:58] it how are you gonna take a rapture
[27:00] sitting at home reading listening to
[27:03] things on the watch the stuff that
[27:05] you're not supposed to be watching on
[27:06] the internet if you're not on the
[27:11] platform you miss it all you missed the
[27:13] boarding and experience you missed the
[27:15] rapture you missed everything you every
[27:16] promise of God that God gave us for this
[27:18] age you'll never be born again bye
[27:21] the platform is a popularity or money or
[27:24] education popularity seems like a real
[27:27] big thing today and you did let me get
[27:29] on this thing for a little bit because
[27:31] you know you know we say that you're
[27:33] born again by the believing of the word
[27:34] and all you have to do is just believe
[27:36] the word but I believe sometimes an
[27:38] altar call is what people need because
[27:40] they need to get down and the altar and
[27:42] show that that something is more
[27:44] worthwhile to them than their popularity
[27:47] that they don't care what anybody else
[27:49] thinks sometimes you need to do a little
[27:51] take a little extra stands actually do a
[27:53] little something extra to show that you
[27:56] don't care about popularity anymore you
[27:58] don't care about whether people think
[28:00] but what kind of clothes you're wearing
[28:01] what well you know whether you got holes
[28:04] in the bottom of your shoes or not
[28:05] because if you down there kneeling at
[28:07] the altar then everybody can see the
[28:09] bottom of your feet you sometimes we
[28:11] need to get past that when you get past
[28:13] that when you get past what other people
[28:16] think about you then you really enter in
[28:18] and entering into freedom territory then
[28:20] when you get past whether people are
[28:23] looking at you because you raise your
[28:25] hands in church or whether you say Amen
[28:27] or whether you run up and down the aisle
[28:29] or whether you come down to the altar
[28:30] then you really get in somewhere what
[28:32] God can use you you'll never be born
[28:38] again by popularity or money or
[28:40] education it takes a god to have a birth
[28:43] and you'll never get a rapture by
[28:45] listening to a previous age and I like
[28:48] you know there was a lot of things that
[28:51] the Baptist said that were good there
[28:52] were a lot of things that Luther said
[28:54] that were wonderful yet for his age and
[28:56] for Wesley and all the things all the
[28:58] things that led up to the seizure to
[28:59] lose the street that was fine for the
[29:01] time that was a fantastic platform for
[29:03] that time as they were it was they were
[29:05] at that junction time but now it's time
[29:08] to take a rapture and if you want to get
[29:10] ready for a rapture you've got to be on
[29:12] this kind of platform this is the
[29:13] platform that you need to be in in the
[29:16] word all the way so get the fire in the
[29:20] engine I'm gonna take a little break
[29:24] here
[29:28] this is serious business I'm not
[29:31] supposed to laugh so how do you get fire
[29:39] in the engine now this is this is that
[29:42] controversial thing we're getting into
[29:44] controversial territory now because
[29:48] because Jesus told them to go to
[29:49] Jerusalem and wait till they were going
[29:51] to deal with power on high weight in
[29:53] Jerusalem because Jerusalem was going to
[29:55] be the starting point Jerusalem was
[29:57] gonna be the place with a fire fell
[29:59] first and after that all the fire that
[30:02] would ever come after that would be an
[30:05] offshoot of that first fire do y'all see
[30:07] what I mean because we're in down there
[30:09] and they were as they were journeying
[30:10] through the wilderness God told Moses
[30:13] how the pattern to erect that Tabernacle
[30:15] with he got the tabernacle all set up
[30:18] and then maybe he was wondering that
[30:19] question to wear how does the fire come
[30:22] from do I have to do I have to strike a
[30:24] match do I have to kyndall something but
[30:27] that God answered his question with
[30:29] starting that fire where's the fire fail
[30:32] God God kindled the fire God is the one
[30:36] that started the fire and every fire
[30:39] after that was kindled from that same
[30:41] fire when Solomon's Temple was erected
[30:44] it was Eagles kindled from that same
[30:45] fire they had two candlesticks inside
[30:48] and it each candlestick had to be lit
[30:50] from the fire of the first one
[30:52] everything started from that same fire
[30:53] and that's how the gospel works
[30:55] everything the fire from the ephesian
[30:58] church age kindled the fire there I read
[31:00] in the next church age of the next of
[31:02] the next all the way down it's like a
[31:04] great tree because you think about
[31:07] Phillip going to Nathaniel come and see
[31:09] a Phillip told Nathaniel coming saying
[31:11] he's kindling a fire
[31:12] Phillip went to the Ethiopian eunuch and
[31:15] he said do you understand what you read
[31:17] in the IAM yeah the eunuch said how can
[31:20] I understand unless some man tells me
[31:22] and they began to talk to him and he
[31:24] kindled a fire before long he was
[31:26] baptizing the Ethiopian eunuch and one
[31:29] after the other down through the ages
[31:30] one tells the other and the other tells
[31:33] the other and it Kindles a fire
[31:36] let me read Jude 1:3 no joke I woke up
[31:43] at 4 o'clock in this morning speaking
[31:46] this scripture from my sleep and it says
[31:50] beloved when I gave all diligence to
[31:53] write unto you of the common salvation
[31:54] it was needful for me to write unto you
[31:57] and exhort you that ye should earnestly
[31:59] contend for the faith which was once
[32:02] delivered unto the Saints but why did
[32:05] why does it read like that contend for
[32:08] the faith the faith which was once
[32:10] delivered under the Saints the faith
[32:14] because there ain't a million different
[32:16] face there's only one faith there's only
[32:18] one Lord one faith one baptism there's
[32:21] only one and and and you know that's
[32:23] what we're trying to get into as it
[32:25] narrows down to the one faith to have an
[32:27] understanding a perfect understanding
[32:29] because that one faith is going to carry
[32:31] us to the end of our journey that one
[32:33] faith is going to take us to true
[32:35] fellowship true oneness with him contend
[32:38] for the faith and that faith that faith
[32:41] was lit on the day of Pentecost that's
[32:43] why I says which was once delivered unto
[32:46] the Saints it was delivered once it
[32:48] doesn't have to be delivered over and
[32:50] over and over again it was delivered
[32:52] exactly the way God wanted it to believe
[32:54] him to be delivered on the day of
[32:55] Pentecost it was delivered the way he
[32:58] wanted to be delivered and a handle and
[33:00] everything and a lot of these things
[33:02] were hidden down through the seven
[33:03] churches as the Romans and whatnot ate
[33:05] away at the word but now at the end that
[33:08] once did that faith that was once
[33:10] delivered to the Saints has been
[33:12] restored again and we can look back with
[33:15] confidence we can look back with a
[33:17] surety and know that we believe that
[33:19] same faith that same faith that was once
[33:21] delivered to them that's been passed
[33:24] down through generations and generations
[33:25] of ones
[33:27] preaching the gospel that's how you
[33:29] light the fires by the preachers of
[33:30] gospel from one to the other from church
[33:33] to church lighting the fire so that the
[33:36] whole world can see all around the world
[33:38] and that fulfills the Great Commission
[33:40] where Jesus said go into all the world
[33:42] and preach the gospel how is the gospel
[33:45] go around the world
[33:46] by passing from one to the other as a
[33:48] fire is lit in one and it goes from one
[33:51] to the other you you read over it and
[34:00] this is what I'm getting to
[34:01] I'm getting to the back behind that
[34:04] locomotive is this big old coal car and
[34:08] that coal cars packed up with fuel for
[34:11] that fire you know you read over in
[34:13] Isaiah where it talks about the Seraphim
[34:16] that took a live coal that live coal was
[34:18] so precious and so revered that that did
[34:21] you ever notice that Seraphim didn't
[34:23] even touch it with his hands he didn't
[34:25] grab a whole two and said here you go he
[34:27] took it with tolls
[34:28] and he took that live coal and he
[34:31] touched it to the prophets li'l and that
[34:33] live coal was enough to cleanse the
[34:35] prophets lips and make him speak ride
[34:37] and make him walk ride and make him a
[34:39] cried that live coal was enough as well
[34:43] that's what I believe the preaching of
[34:44] the gospel is as the shoveling of the
[34:46] coal what is it what you got people in
[34:49] there and the locomotive there's a
[34:50] shovel that coal to keep it moving hey
[34:53] shovel it into that furnace that's
[34:55] shoveling it faster and faster and what
[34:57] they're doing is if I can compare the
[34:59] ministers as they're not shoveling coal
[35:01] so much
[35:01] shoveling promises shoveling the
[35:04] promises of God where you got ministers
[35:06] around the world that are preaching he's
[35:08] the same yesterday today and forever
[35:10] that there is power in the blood that
[35:12] the Lord God healeth all thy diseases
[35:14] that all things are possible to them
[35:17] they believe believe in you and your
[35:19] house shall be shaved and that's
[35:22] shuttling those promises in you know if
[35:25] you go look back at what it takes to
[35:27] move a locomotive up a hill it takes for
[35:35] just a slight grade for 25 pounds scoops
[35:41] every 15 seconds to climb a hill and
[35:46] that furnace is putting out for 195
[35:49] degree heat for 25 pound scoops every 15
[35:55] seconds to climb a hill so what does
[35:58] that mean
[35:59] that means those ministers that I'm
[36:02] going to put as an example those
[36:04] ministers are shoveling coal like
[36:06] nobody's business
[36:08] God promised it he promised he promised
[36:10] and the signs and wonders would follow
[36:12] them they believe he promised that he
[36:14] was wounded for our sins for our
[36:17] transgressions he was bruised for our
[36:19] iniquities nothing you have to do to
[36:21] merit it all you have to do is believe
[36:23] it because he promised it he made a way
[36:26] for you he and when he makes a promise
[36:28] when he puts an objective of the thing
[36:31] out there for you to do for you to
[36:33] achieve he makes a way for you to do it
[36:36] he made he equips his ministers he
[36:38] equips his people he equips his
[36:40] believers he gives you something to
[36:42] accomplish you with and in what he gave
[36:44] us to accomplish the goal what he gave
[36:47] us to keep the locomotive running is the
[36:49] fire of the gospel the word the word is
[36:52] what he gave us you know you look around
[36:56] you you think about this those ministers
[37:00] that I'm gonna call a minister shoveling
[37:02] coal in the locomotive shoveling it
[37:04] covered by coal dust covered by coal
[37:07] dust and seared by the singeing flames
[37:09] and then people begin to talk about I'm
[37:12] gonna say well well I don't know if he's
[37:13] preaching right I don't know I don't
[37:15] know if I like this person particular
[37:17] person instead of accumulating the word
[37:19] instead of coming in the water into the
[37:21] service and just opening themselves up
[37:23] to receive the word what many people do
[37:25] is they begin to accumulate accumulate
[37:27] offenses and I tell you one thing that
[37:30] one thing about church is that the
[37:31] church is a good opportunity for you to
[37:33] accumulate offenses you start feeling
[37:35] like you're getting preached on and some
[37:37] don't go the way that you should
[37:38] somebody doesn't say instead of you
[37:41] singing somebody else does or instead of
[37:42] you getting play in it to play an
[37:44] instrument somebody else does and before
[37:45] long these things start getting in the
[37:48] way and clogging up those flus so that
[37:51] the thing doesn't burn right so that it
[37:53] doesn't move right and you know there's
[37:56] a remedy for that if the remedy is
[38:00] really hard for us to do sometimes the
[38:03] remedy is to forgive one another to
[38:05] forgive stuff the stuff is gonna happen
[38:07] is it can't help but happen along life's
[38:10] Road you're gonna get
[38:11] things you know somebody's gonna say
[38:13] something about you and and things begin
[38:15] to go wrong or whatever but the best
[38:18] thing to do is for us to just say well I
[38:19] forgive because you know brother Branham
[38:21] said you can't have faith without
[38:22] forgiveness you can't have a real true
[38:25] faith without forgiveness I believe even
[38:27] even forgiving your brother when when
[38:28] you don't even they don't even come
[38:30] begging you just forgive them anyway
[38:32] because so many times things get
[38:33] interpreted the wrong way is you think
[38:35] somebody said something or did I left
[38:37] you out on purpose when there really
[38:39] didn't they just that you life just got
[38:41] in the way life just happened it's still
[38:43] instead of accumulating the word and
[38:45] just letting it pile up and unclog the
[38:48] flues we accumulate offenses and things
[38:51] and let that all these worries and
[38:53] things I believe we all just give way to
[38:56] God and let that fire just blast
[38:58] everything out of it because we were
[39:00] predestinated to be in that gospel
[39:02] locomotive running down the track at
[39:04] full speed not hindered by anything if a
[39:07] cow gets in a track just that there's
[39:09] supposed to be a power in that blue
[39:10] light locomotive that blacks that cow
[39:12] off the track the old devil gets in your
[39:15] way just blast it out of the way oh my
[39:31] so we get that we get the fire down and
[39:34] they fire down on the locomotive going
[39:36] real good we get the fire going and it
[39:39] begins to produce something something
[39:42] gets to bowling and that's the next
[39:45] thing I'm gonna talk about you're
[39:51] feeding it real good
[39:52] you go on lickety-split you you're you
[39:55] get the fire going real good down inside
[39:59] that locomotive that nobody can see just
[40:03] you just you are aware of that thing
[40:04] because it's faith and nobody else can
[40:08] see your face it's something that only
[40:10] you are truly aware of something burning
[40:14] down on the inside and what's that what
[40:17] happens as it begins to to bubble up
[40:19] that that steam that water pressure
[40:21] begins to build up and you know brother
[40:24] Graham preached
[40:24] all these sermons about pressure letting
[40:26] off the pressure and and how how we need
[40:29] to be pressurized let me let me read
[40:31] this quote about what brother Bram said
[40:33] in and enticing spirits number five he
[40:41] said it's just like down here the car
[40:43] works where they build a big bunch of
[40:45] freight cars or a big bunch of passenger
[40:47] cars I used to work there and they take
[40:50] and build those big coaches and
[40:51] everything and put hardwood in and lay
[40:53] mahogany all around and everything so
[40:55] beautiful set it out there on the track
[40:57] and it was as dead as a doornail they're
[40:59] set the engine no steam in it so see
[41:02] there it might be all right with a fire
[41:06] in it but you got to have steam in it
[41:08] too you got to have power in it she just
[41:13] sit there what it needs today is some
[41:16] fire and the Bolar what it needs today
[41:18] is some steam what it needs today in the
[41:21] church to boil to the hottest Bowlin
[41:23] thing there is to Baal sin out of your
[41:26] life is love and if you can't love one
[41:30] another how you going to love God who
[41:31] you haven't seen love hides a multitude
[41:33] of seeing get in love with God then
[41:35] you'll love one another then you'll love
[41:37] the church
[41:38] you'll love the calls you'll love
[41:41] everything that's godly and you'll keep
[41:43] away from the things of the world so
[41:46] that fire begins to it begins to create
[41:49] something on the inside and what's
[41:51] happening is is that word that you've
[41:53] been here it begins to expand and the
[41:56] spirit begins to work because that's
[41:58] what happens the more you eat the more
[42:00] of the word takes over the more you
[42:03] believe there more it takes over until
[42:05] it eventually takes the goal is for it
[42:07] to completely take over take over all of
[42:10] your senses take over your memory and
[42:12] reason and conscious affection
[42:13] imagination take over everything until
[42:16] you're a complete union of God
[42:17] completely given over to him where that
[42:20] fire on the inside is God and the whole
[42:22] thing directing the whole thing and that
[42:25] pressure begins to build up until you've
[42:28] got something to come back the pressures
[42:30] of the world with because you've got
[42:32] pressures on the outside the flesh is
[42:35] beating in on that from the outside and
[42:37] there's a
[42:37] there's a pressure on the inside that's
[42:39] combating that the lust of the flesh the
[42:41] trials of life when when someone says
[42:43] something against you all these things
[42:46] that you know brother Brown talked about
[42:48] how he preached about how that like a
[42:51] fish when it goes down into the bottom
[42:52] of the sea it needs to be pressurized so
[42:55] that it can withstand the pressures of
[42:57] the ocean ocean it's got to have
[42:59] something on the inside to react to the
[43:02] pressures on the outside and that fire
[43:04] on the inside of you was creating that
[43:06] pressure that to react to give you
[43:08] something what is what it's giving you
[43:10] with something
[43:11] what it's giving you is something to
[43:14] power the wheels with something to get
[43:17] the wheels moving because what good does
[43:20] it do to have faith if you don't have
[43:22] works what good does it do to have faith
[43:25] if you're just sitting there on the
[43:26] tracks doing nothing not talking to
[43:28] other people not sharing the gospel not
[43:30] passing the gospel around not helping
[43:32] others not met you know the gospel the
[43:35] gospel is a Christian life is supposed
[43:37] to be living for others living for
[43:39] others is what Christianity is about
[43:41] it's not for us to be hide and cooped up
[43:44] in the tabernacle like down in the Holy
[43:46] of Holies all the time cooped up on the
[43:48] inside but sooner or later you got to
[43:50] come out you got to manifest on the
[43:53] outside what you got while you were in
[43:55] say in there eating the shewbread and
[43:57] the the manor and back in there with the
[44:00] the life of Aaron's rod budding and all
[44:03] of those things that that represents
[44:05] sooner or later you got to come out
[44:10] let's read number seven
[44:19] faith once delivered to the Saints that
[44:21] says it's just because we won't let him
[44:25] do it oh how he wants to try this take
[44:30] this convention in his arms I said
[44:31] children I want to work with you I want
[44:33] to work through you he's trying to press
[44:35] his way into you just like her just like
[44:38] all the water in the world put up in a
[44:39] four-foot barrel four foot across how
[44:42] many tens of thousands miles higher that
[44:44] would be what a pressure it will be
[44:46] trying to get through that's like the
[44:49] Holy Spirit trying to get into the
[44:50] church trying to find a little crevice
[44:53] somewhere to bring himself into to bless
[44:56] you and to make you grow and to live and
[44:59] yet we stay dry hard I don't know about
[45:04] that oh my he's pressing trying to get
[45:07] into you so that he can press out he's
[45:10] trying to get in there so that he can
[45:12] begin to envelop you and take you take
[45:14] you completely over and push out and
[45:17] what does it what happens when the
[45:19] pressure begins to build up well there's
[45:21] two ways really to let that pressure out
[45:23] you got a whistle
[45:25] and you got wheels and a lot of times we
[45:28] think the way for the steam to get let
[45:31] out is to let it out with the whistle
[45:33] that's where a lot of confusion is risen
[45:35] up and a lot of impersonation and things
[45:38] where I got I can impersonate a whistle
[45:40] letting off I can just I can just scream
[45:42] out loud or office all sorts of things
[45:44] let that whistle off but you let some
[45:47] some of that steam power or get to those
[45:49] wheels get to those locomotive wheels
[45:51] and get that thing to rolling and that's
[45:54] something that you can't impersonate
[45:55] because it's really moving it's moving
[45:57] and it's got power behind it power to
[46:00] pull every promise of God now that I've
[46:04] said that I'm going to use the whistle
[46:06] for a little something different because
[46:07] when you're getting up to a crossing
[46:09] where you start hearing that alarm bell
[46:11] ding ding ding ding ding maybe it's a
[46:13] river Jordan in your life and maybe
[46:15] that's a the Red Sea in your life is a
[46:17] big problem in your life something a job
[46:20] interview or who knows what all we go
[46:23] through and you start I believe if we
[46:25] start doing like if you remember the
[46:27] story of FF Bosworth where he said he
[46:29] told Brandon I got the Lord gave me a
[46:31] sermon
[46:32] and and and I'm going down to this city
[46:35] to preach this sermon I got to preach
[46:37] this sermon and brother Graham said well
[46:38] that's wonderful what's y'all excited
[46:40] about he was he was starting to let that
[46:42] whistle blow in a different way he said
[46:45] well what I'm excited about is is is
[46:47] that I need some money to go down into
[46:50] this city and I don't have any so the
[46:52] Lord is gonna have to perform a miracle
[46:54] for me to get down in this city and
[46:56] preach this message that God gave me so
[46:59] what he was doing was he was blowing
[47:00] that whistle he was blowing the whistle
[47:02] that as he went through that cross and
[47:04] ding-ding-ding-ding thank God is able
[47:06] God is able to provide for my needs God
[47:08] is gonna give me a miracle and before
[47:10] long he saw it come to pass and when he
[47:13] got on the other side of that crossing
[47:14] after God had given him the money and
[47:16] performed the miracle he was able to let
[47:17] that whistle blow praise God like with
[47:20] the way they shouted when they crossed
[47:21] you for the river Jordan and they began
[47:23] to dance dance like David did when they
[47:25] were bringing the Archaean because I
[47:27] believe that when that wouldn't that
[47:29] steam against the whale up on the inside
[47:31] there's something that somebody has got
[47:32] to be expressed some way sometimes you
[47:35] know when you're alone in the car
[47:36] sometimes or in the shower or whatever
[47:38] sometimes that steam start swelling up
[47:41] and you just gotta let the whistle blow
[47:42] but the point is it's good when the
[47:45] whistle blows but let that steam power
[47:47] go to those locomotive wheels to get
[47:49] there turning them wheels so that the
[47:51] power is made manifest in a Christian
[47:54] life and you know what I believe if you
[47:56] were to able to kind of lean up against
[47:58] that locomotive or get real close to it
[48:00] as it was going by you would hear them
[48:02] wheels begin to say something like this
[48:04] works it's faith expressed works his
[48:08] faith expressed works this faith
[48:10] expressed because that's what the power
[48:12] of the gospel does and those in those
[48:14] locomotive wheels as it's going down the
[48:16] track speeding you to it to your
[48:18] destination it is works its faith
[48:21] expressed spitting all over this pulpit
[48:25] I pause yeah you know I'll be I'll be
[48:33] finishing up in just a second y'all hang
[48:35] on
[48:35] y'all doing good
[48:39] before that steam before that stinging
[48:42] for that steam to be released there's a
[48:45] little throttle in there that that that
[48:48] the the man has to he has to push and
[48:52] what that does is it opens up a pass for
[48:55] the power to come out it opens up a pass
[48:58] for it to be released and that's kind of
[49:01] what I'm getting at is you got that face
[49:04] you got that fire down here but there's
[49:07] got to be a pass open up for the power
[49:10] to come out Oh where's that quote come
[49:22] on now
[49:28] I can't find them that I'm just gonna
[49:32] quote it oh here we go
[49:33] praise the Lord number 8 the statute of
[49:38] a perfect man
[49:40] you mean this has been about the statute
[49:43] of man all this time Robbo I thought you
[49:47] did somebody gospel Lokomotiv the Bible
[49:54] said we read over here in the Book of
[49:56] Luke where it said virtue went out of
[49:57] him that right if we're going to be like
[50:01] him we must have virtue then we must
[50:05] have it to be like him is the first song
[50:08] that I ever loved in the hymns one of
[50:10] the greatest was to be like Jesus well
[50:14] if I'm going to be like Jesus I've got
[50:16] to have a virtue and a pass that it can
[50:20] pass forward from me to the people from
[50:26] me to give out and that's why you know I
[50:30] think sometimes we kind of gloss over we
[50:32] gloss over stuff like virtue we I want
[50:35] to get to the good stuff I want to get
[50:37] to to the temperance and and and and the
[50:40] things that you think you're struggling
[50:41] with you know but you know you can't
[50:44] have virtue knowledge temperance
[50:47] patience until you get a fire and you
[50:51] can't have any of the others until you
[50:54] got a pass for it to pass out to the
[50:56] other people you can't have any of the
[50:59] others
[50:59] how you gonna have brotherly kindness if
[51:01] you don't have the power the power to
[51:05] pass out how are you going to have
[51:07] brotherly kindness if you don't have
[51:09] that steam in there building up pressure
[51:12] on the inside produces something that
[51:15] will drive the wheels you might have a
[51:18] fire down on the inside but if you don't
[51:20] have the wheels turning how you gonna
[51:23] get brotherly kindness you gotta have
[51:25] the wheels kind of turning before you
[51:28] can have the others
[51:33] I'm just laughing because it you know it
[51:36] seems like a little simple message but
[51:38] you know another thing I think people
[51:42] seriously people struggle with so much
[51:43] is that the thing that you got to do
[51:47] something you got to do something to get
[51:50] virtue you got to do something all you
[51:53] have to do and we I know we keep harping
[51:56] on this all you have to do is keep
[51:58] shoveling coal all you have to do is
[52:01] keep shoveling those live coals and
[52:03] that's live because it's already knowing
[52:05] it just believe it just take it put it
[52:08] in that burner down on the inside of
[52:10] your heart and let it rise up through
[52:12] all the flus let it power the wheels of
[52:14] your life and what it'll produce is
[52:18] works is faith expressed what it'll
[52:21] produce is a Christian life what it'll
[52:23] produce is that the end of dirty
[52:25] Christians it'll produce a life where
[52:28] other people can look at you and say
[52:29] well that person is a real true
[52:32] born-again Christian and they'll look at
[52:34] you like that woman that reached out and
[52:36] touch the hem of her of Jesus's garment
[52:38] and say I know there's something in that
[52:40] person that I can draw from because that
[52:44] person is living a Christian life it'll
[52:47] produce something in you so much that
[52:48] when people say wrong about you other
[52:51] people will defend you and say I know
[52:53] that's not what that person believes I
[52:55] know that's not what my pastor believes
[52:57] I know that's not what kind of person
[52:59] they are because that person I know
[53:01] they've got real true genuine virtue a
[53:04] real true Christian life something real
[53:08] on the inside working this way on the
[53:11] outside to power the wheels of that
[53:13] gospel locomotive to make it move down
[53:16] the track to its destination I'm trying
[53:21] to finish and what is our destination we
[53:28] come down through all these Junction
[53:29] times faith virtue 7 Church ages
[53:34] Junction after Junction after Junction
[53:37] Junction chime there ain't no more
[53:40] junctions that's not that's not good
[53:42] English is it there aren't any more
[53:44] junctions that's the list
[53:47] the last Junction this is the last stop
[53:50] an off point this is the last platform
[53:52] they started in a platform in Ephesians
[53:56] they started a platform in that up room
[53:58] waiting for the manifestation waiting
[54:01] for the spirit to come and quicken the
[54:03] word that they had already heard a now
[54:06] it's time for us to get on the platform
[54:09] of this message and they be prepared get
[54:12] on the platform and wait to see what God
[54:15] will do in your life our job is not to
[54:18] produce something our job is just to be
[54:22] prepared so that when he comes
[54:24] everything will be in order
[54:26] the brides job is not when the bride and
[54:29] the groom get married the bride's job if
[54:31] you really want to go back into the old
[54:33] things of what not the bride's job is
[54:35] not to provide for the family
[54:37] the bride's job is not to put food on
[54:40] the table the bride's job is just to
[54:43] produce life to produce children all she
[54:46] has to do is receive from her husband
[54:48] and just just rest just entering the
[54:50] rest and that's all your job is tonight
[54:53] if that's if you get nothing else from
[54:54] this message you don't have to do
[54:56] anything but just rely completely on the
[54:59] groom just rely just rest completely on
[55:02] him the musicians can go ahead and come
[55:06] because I I think I finally reached a
[55:08] stopping place how do you know that
[55:15] [Applause]
[55:22] you know you think about when Moses
[55:25] leading the children of Israel through
[55:27] through exit down through the wilderness
[55:29] journey and everything and they heard
[55:31] the voice of Moses but then it came time
[55:34] for the voice of fulfillment to come and
[55:37] I believe that voice is here we've heard
[55:39] the message we've heard the word and now
[55:42] it's time for that voice of fulfillment
[55:44] to sound out the voices in the bride
[55:47] throw that in there I gotta throw that
[55:49] in there the voices in the bride why
[55:53] because she's heard the shout she's
[55:55] heard the message she's heard that
[55:58] message and now it's being fulfilled in
[56:00] her amen and I'll just I'll just stop
