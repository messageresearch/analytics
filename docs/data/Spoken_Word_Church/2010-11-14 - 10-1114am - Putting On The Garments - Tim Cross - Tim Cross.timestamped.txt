[45:03] and she was sharing with me
[45:05] uh the desire of her heart for her
[45:07] children for her husband
[45:09] and uh she was raised baptist and her
[45:12] husband has always been raised
[45:14] well he was actually he was raised
[45:16] baptist but he didn't convert it over to
[45:18] methodist
[45:19] and she was telling me
[45:22] and she was weeping she said i'm so
[45:24] concerned for my husband she said he
[45:26] lives
[45:27] such a sad life she said he believes
[45:30] he's going to make it to heaven based on
[45:32] his good life
[45:33] and his good works and she said he's
[45:35] very uncomfortable even going into a
[45:37] baptist church hearing
[45:39] what she described as hellfire and
[45:41] brimstone preaching
[45:42] she said that makes him uncomfortable
[45:44] but she said he doesn't realize
[45:46] he needs the grace of jesus christ he
[45:49] needs the blood of christ to wash him
[45:51] from his sins
[45:53] and i tell you one thing we're blessed
[45:55] to have that realization this morning

[52:14] romans chapter 13 beginning in verse 11.
[52:20] the bible says and that
[52:23] knowing the time
[52:25] that now it is high time to awake out of
[52:29] sleep
[52:30] for now is our salvation nearer
[52:34] than when we believed
[52:36] the night
[52:38] is far spent
[52:39] the day is at hand
[52:42] let us therefore cast off the works of
[52:45] darkness
[52:47] and let us put on the armor of light
[52:52] let us walk honestly as in the day
[52:55] not in rioting and drunkenness
[52:58] not in chambering and waltonness
[53:01] not in strife and envying
[53:04] i want to
[53:05] place special emphasis on verse 14
[53:10] but put ye on
[53:12] the lord jesus christ
[53:15] and made not provision for the flesh
[53:19] to fulfill the lust thereof let's read
[53:22] that verse together again
[53:24] but put ye on
[53:26] the lord jesus christ
[53:29] and make not provision for the flesh
[53:33] to fulfill
[53:34] the lust thereof
[53:36] amen may the lord add his blessings to
[53:38] the reading of his word you may be
[53:40] seated this morning
[53:43] and in just a few moments we'll turn and
[53:46] also read from galatians chapter three
[53:51] but i want to take for a thought this
[53:53] morning or for a title
[53:56] putting on the garments
[53:58] putting on the garments and paul here as
[54:01] he writes to the roman
[54:02] church there he
[54:04] commends them to put on
[54:06] the lord jesus christ
[54:09] and we'll also read here in
[54:11] galatians chapter three
[54:14] we'll just read verses 26
[54:17] and 27
[54:19] and his paul here also addresses
[54:22] the
[54:23] galatian church
[54:25] and i believe the prophet of god
[54:27] exhorts us to see ourselves in the word
[54:30] of god amen
[54:31] and here in verse 26 of galatians
[54:34] chapter 3
[54:35] paul says for ye are all
[54:38] the children
[54:41] that would also be the offspring amen
[54:44] you are all the children of god
[54:47] by faith in christ jesus
[54:51] for as many of you as have been baptized
[54:55] into christ
[54:57] have
[54:58] put on
[54:59] christ
[55:01] amen how many is that's your heart's
[55:02] desire this morning
[55:04] is to put on christ
[55:06] now turn with me also to the book of
[55:08] titus
[55:10] and if you will just read for read with
[55:13] me here just to establish
[55:14] a little bit of a foundation
[55:17] and titus chapter 2
[55:19] we'll read two verses of scripture here
[55:22] and from this portion of scripture
[55:24] is where i begin to receive inspiration
[55:27] for the thought that we'll deal with
[55:29] this morning
[55:30] and i want to say this too that
[55:32] um
[55:34] i've been ministering now on this
[55:36] thought for about the past three or four
[55:38] services
[55:39] and it just keeps unfolding and opening
[55:41] up into more and more things
[55:43] and i don't
[55:45] i don't suppose we'll be able to cover
[55:46] all of those things this morning in this
[55:48] service but i just trusting the
[55:51] leadership of the holy spirit to guide
[55:52] me into what areas would be his perfect
[55:56] will for this service this morning and
[55:58] then from these things i trust it will
[56:00] stimulate your your thoughts and your
[56:03] interests in these things from the word
[56:05] of god because i believe it has a very
[56:08] relevant application to where you and i
[56:11] are in this hour now
[56:13] at the end of time and as the bride of
[56:15] christ but paul here is exhorting titus
[56:19] as a
[56:20] in the pastoral work
[56:22] as he is here dealing with the church
[56:25] and you know uh when we minister when we
[56:28] gather in a group like this we have
[56:30] people from all walks of life
[56:33] you know and and titus here was dealing
[56:35] with uh people in the congregation
[56:38] perhaps there were some who were wealthy
[56:40] who were been prosperous in life maybe
[56:43] they were held in high esteem or high
[56:45] regard and then there were some who who
[56:48] worked in servanthood
[56:50] and even in this time in this in this
[56:52] era of time it was very common to have
[56:55] slavery and i think that much of the
[56:57] church was made up at that time of
[57:00] slaves and of common people and people
[57:03] much like you and i today you know so
[57:05] he's exhorting titus here in chapter 2
[57:09] and verse 9.
[57:10] he says to titus exhort servants to be
[57:15] obedient and to their own masters
[57:18] and to please them well in all things
[57:21] not answering again
[57:23] and in verse 10 he says not perlini that
[57:26] word also means stealing or thievery
[57:29] not pervoiding but showing all good
[57:33] fidelity now watch this
[57:35] that they may adorn
[57:38] that they may adorn the doctrine of god
[57:41] our savior in all things
[57:44] and i i tell you how i came across this
[57:47] scripture was uh as part of a bible
[57:50] study that i'm a part of there every
[57:52] wednesday morning and and this is a a
[57:55] group of about six or seven men
[57:58] and they come from all denominations and
[58:00] all backgrounds only only two of us
[58:03] there are believers of the message and
[58:05] some are coming into it but the two of
[58:07] us there have been raised and spent many
[58:09] years
[58:10] studying in the prophet's message but we
[58:13] came across this scripture in our bible
[58:15] reading three or four weeks ago
[58:17] and it was very uh
[58:20] it was very interesting to us how that
[58:22] paul
[58:23] uses the phrase adorn the doctrine of
[58:27] god
[58:28] right and you know we think of that word
[58:31] adorn and we're coming up now we're
[58:32] approaching the christmas season where
[58:34] we you know put or so the world at least
[58:37] puts decorations on their homes they put
[58:40] adornments and all these things on their
[58:42] home they you know deck the halls and
[58:44] they put the uh the the lights and the
[58:47] mistletoe and all these things the
[58:50] glitter and the gold on the on the trees
[58:52] and on their homes and you think of
[58:54] adorning in that way
[58:56] we could think of adorning perhaps with
[58:58] jewelry uh you know whether i have a
[59:02] tie chain on this morning you know or
[59:05] maybe a pen or
[59:06] sometimes the sisters will wear
[59:08] something i think they call a brooch you
[59:10] know it's just something they they pin
[59:12] onto their clothes as part of the
[59:14] garment they're wearing uh you know the
[59:16] boy scouts or the girl scouts get merit
[59:18] badges
[59:19] and they put those things on their
[59:21] uniform to indicate their labors or
[59:24] their efforts or some area they have
[59:26] specialized in but paul here is speaking
[59:30] to titus and in the king james
[59:33] translation of this from the hebrew into
[59:36] english adorned means to put on as a
[59:39] garment
[59:41] it's something that we're to wear it's
[59:42] something that we're to clothe ourselves
[59:44] in
[59:45] and when i began to think of it in that
[59:47] regard then it you know brother ma'am
[59:50] talked about the roman candle how it
[59:52] goes off and it just continues bursting
[59:54] forth and as we were sitting around the
[59:56] table there at a little coffee shop and
[59:58] one of the brothers i think he's from a
[1:00:00] lutheran background he he just took
[1:00:02] special note of that that phrase there
[1:00:05] and i was looking at this other brother
[1:00:07] who's a believer
[1:00:09] you know in our minds we went back to
[1:00:11] the garden of eden
[1:00:12] when satan came and deceived eve there
[1:00:15] with the temptation and then she uh went
[1:00:19] to adam and adam and eve went
[1:00:21] immediately and began to sow fig leaves
[1:00:23] together
[1:00:25] to create a covering to put on a
[1:00:27] religion that would hopefully appease a
[1:00:30] holy god amen because they had a desire
[1:00:34] to be admitted back into his presence
[1:00:37] but there was something there where they
[1:00:39] realized they would have to be dressed
[1:00:41] in something even that would enable them
[1:00:44] to enter back into his presence and they
[1:00:47] put all the fig leaves it was their best
[1:00:49] effort it was their best attempt they
[1:00:51] meant to please god but it wasn't
[1:00:53] sufficient
[1:00:54] amen it took jehovah god it took elohim
[1:00:58] to provide them with a sacrifice that he
[1:01:03] alone would be pleased with
[1:01:06] amen and he alone could provide that for
[1:01:09] them right amen it was nothing they
[1:01:11] could conjure up there was nothing they
[1:01:13] could formulate it was nothing they
[1:01:16] would in their own mental powers could
[1:01:19] ever come up with to please god that's
[1:01:21] right hey
[1:01:23] my oh he's jehovah
[1:01:26] god will provide for himself
[1:01:29] a sacrifice right oh we begin to think
[1:01:32] of that i thought of joseph and the code
[1:01:34] of many colors i thought of the hebrew
[1:01:37] children down in babylon how the
[1:01:39] nebuchadnezzar tried to change their
[1:01:42] clothing to represent the babylonian
[1:01:44] tastes and the babylonian fashions and
[1:01:47] designs and things of that hour amen and
[1:01:50] those hebrew children absolutely
[1:01:52] resisted that
[1:01:54] amen they said we're not going to dress
[1:01:56] in your clothes we're not going to
[1:01:58] borrow from your fashions we're not
[1:02:01] going to try to please the modern world
[1:02:04] around us we are going to maintain our
[1:02:07] hebrew heritage
[1:02:09] we are going to maintain our identity we
[1:02:12] are going to maintain our place of
[1:02:15] origin the country that we come from the
[1:02:19] letters that we come from we are the
[1:02:21] royal seed of abraham and we're not
[1:02:23] ashamed to dress like him oh my how that
[1:02:27] must have been a rebuke in the face of
[1:02:30] all the other jews and all the other
[1:02:32] hebrews amen that were compromising
[1:02:34] their standards and compromising their
[1:02:37] convictions how they must have come up
[1:02:39] to those young people and said well you
[1:02:41] won't be popular
[1:02:43] you won't be accepted
[1:02:46] you won't fit in
[1:02:48] they couldn't argue with that
[1:02:50] right
[1:02:52] amen right you might as well accept it
[1:02:55] we're gonna be down here in bondage for
[1:02:58] so many hundreds of years because the
[1:03:00] prophet jeremiah prophesied it
[1:03:03] and if you believe the prophet you might
[1:03:05] as well just like it
[1:03:07] you might as well just get used to it
[1:03:09] we're trapped in this laodicea we're
[1:03:12] trapped in this babylon so you might as
[1:03:15] well just give up on your convictions
[1:03:18] give up on your morals give up on your
[1:03:20] standards because it's not gonna do this
[1:03:23] it's not gonna do that and it's not
[1:03:25] gonna do all these other things but
[1:03:27] there was something else those garments
[1:03:29] wouldn't do they wouldn't burn
[1:03:32] amen there was a special quality to
[1:03:36] those garments that they had been
[1:03:38] trusting and because the hebrew children
[1:03:42] refused to compromise
[1:03:44] and refused to allow their speaking to
[1:03:47] be influenced in the babylonian
[1:03:49] direction
[1:03:50] god came and reinforced their testimony
[1:03:55] amen the holy god elohim
[1:03:59] thought the job was so important for the
[1:04:02] aaron that he wouldn't assign it to an
[1:04:04] archangel
[1:04:06] amen he said those hebrew children
[1:04:10] aren't taking a stand for angels they're
[1:04:13] not taking a stand for their pastor
[1:04:15] they're not taking a stand for this one
[1:04:18] or that one they are standing for me and
[1:04:21] i'm going to go down there and stand for
[1:04:23] them
[1:04:24] it's important brother and sister
[1:04:27] there's a great significance
[1:04:31] pardon me there's a great significance
[1:04:34] to our garments
[1:04:36] and paul is exhorting
[1:04:38] titus
[1:04:40] to adorn
[1:04:43] the doctrine
[1:04:45] of god i save you in all things
[1:04:48] i think of doctrine
[1:04:50] and i know at times in my life
[1:04:53] i have gone through phases i've gone
[1:04:55] through periods of time
[1:04:57] when i put a lot of emphasis
[1:05:00] on my beliefs
[1:05:02] my doctrines being precise you know
[1:05:05] and because of the way the the light has
[1:05:09] shown upon the revealed word of this
[1:05:11] hour
[1:05:12] there has never been a moment in time
[1:05:14] when so much revelation was made
[1:05:17] available
[1:05:19] all the truths that were lost down
[1:05:21] through the dark ages
[1:05:23] everything that was forfeited in icy
[1:05:25] rome has been restored and in addition
[1:05:28] to that christ himself has descended in
[1:05:32] this hour amen to tear the seals off the
[1:05:35] book and to make available to the bride
[1:05:38] of christ
[1:05:39] truths and revelations that have never
[1:05:42] been made available to man in the
[1:05:43] history of time
[1:05:45] amen so we're living a tremendous hour
[1:05:48] brother and sister but there is also an
[1:05:51] effort on the part i believe of our
[1:05:53] enemy to get us so focused on being
[1:05:57] precise in our theology
[1:06:00] okay
[1:06:01] to be placed so much emphasis on how
[1:06:04] right we are
[1:06:06] we've got the truth and the god
[1:06:09] we've got the truth of water baptism in
[1:06:11] jesus name we've got the truth of
[1:06:13] serpenty we can explain it we can
[1:06:16] articulate it we can detail it and then
[1:06:19] we can prove our point with the best of
[1:06:21] it amen there is not a modern religion
[1:06:25] or theologian in the world that can
[1:06:27] withstand the truth that the bride of
[1:06:30] christ takes for common knowledge now
[1:06:32] that's right hey man i like one brother
[1:06:35] yesterday liking it you said we have a
[1:06:37] nuclear arsenal
[1:06:40] and the best that the denominations can
[1:06:43] offer
[1:06:43] would be relative to a bb gun
[1:06:46] now that's the truth brother that is not
[1:06:49] an exaggeration
[1:06:51] however to whom much is given
[1:06:54] much is required
[1:06:57] we have been given a sacred trust
[1:07:01] and it is in our
[1:07:03] it is in our discretion
[1:07:05] how we present that to the world
[1:07:09] that's right
[1:07:11] and you will notice here if you read in
[1:07:12] the book of titus
[1:07:14] paul is not dealing so much with
[1:07:17] being doctrinally precise
[1:07:21] but he's getting down where the rubber
[1:07:22] meets the road
[1:07:24] he's getting down in the lives and the
[1:07:26] conduct of the people on a day-to-day
[1:07:29] basis right
[1:07:31] how we handle our be ourselves at work
[1:07:34] right how we hold ourselves amen not
[1:07:37] just when we come to church why it's
[1:07:39] easy to be a christian then it's easy
[1:07:41] for our halos you know to shine then but
[1:07:44] it's when you go out of these doors
[1:07:46] it's when you go into the fiery furnace
[1:07:49] it's when you're going to the laodicean
[1:07:52] pressure cooker it's when the children
[1:07:54] have to go to the public schools or the
[1:07:56] college campuses or the university or
[1:08:00] the sister you know has to go down to
[1:08:02] the workplace or the brothers has to go
[1:08:04] down amongst centers say that our
[1:08:06] conducts our behavior our actions amen
[1:08:10] shows if we have truly had an experience
[1:08:14] and the world doesn't care how revelated
[1:08:17] you are
[1:08:18] they don't care how doctrinally precise
[1:08:20] you are
[1:08:21] they want to see jesus that's right they
[1:08:25] are dying for a lack of love
[1:08:28] they're dying for a lack of the
[1:08:30] manifestation
[1:08:32] of the life of christ
[1:08:34] and paul is saying we need to adorn
[1:08:37] ourselves with the doctrine of god
[1:08:39] ourselves
[1:08:41] not just have our list you know
[1:08:44] i believe this i believe that i've got
[1:08:46] the truth on all of these wonderful
[1:08:48] things but if we don't have a life left
[1:08:50] behind it
[1:08:52] it's all in vain
[1:08:54] though i know all the mysteries
[1:08:58] and have not love i'm as a sounding
[1:09:00] breast
[1:09:01] and a tinkling symbol
[1:09:05] so this is
[1:09:07] this is coming down where the robber
[1:09:08] meets the road right
[1:09:10] brother brown says lived voices
[1:09:14] thundering out
[1:09:15] that's the thunder that shakes the devil
[1:09:18] come on amen notice jesus never came to
[1:09:21] satan in the temptation
[1:09:22] wilderness and said
[1:09:25] don't you know on the
[1:09:27] immaculate conception
[1:09:31] don't you know
[1:09:32] out of the virgin born
[1:09:35] manifestation of god wrapped in a robe
[1:09:37] of flesh
[1:09:41] he never attacked satan
[1:09:44] with doctrine right
[1:09:46] satan was trying to attack jesus it is
[1:09:49] written
[1:09:50] it is written
[1:09:52] but the written word
[1:09:54] versus the written word
[1:09:57] that's right it won't do it that's right
[1:10:00] you're not going to defeat the devil
[1:10:02] with your quotes
[1:10:04] you're not going to defeat the devil
[1:10:06] with your intellectual understanding of
[1:10:08] the bible in the message
[1:10:10] you're not going to defeat the devil
[1:10:12] amen with your ten commandments you
[1:10:14] pharisee
[1:10:16] you're going to defeat the devil in the
[1:10:19] life of jesus christ
[1:10:21] the dynamics comes and strikes those
[1:10:25] mechanics and makes you a living son and
[1:10:28] daughter of god amen and that's when you
[1:10:31] have put on christ amen when you have
[1:10:33] died to yourself you have been stripped
[1:10:36] of all your ideas and your ways and your
[1:10:40] notions and your premonitions and you
[1:10:42] have died out completely to that right
[1:10:46] then christ can come and live through
[1:10:48] you right right hey
[1:10:50] amen amen isaiah 61 verse 3 says oh my

[1:15:52] covered me
[1:15:53] with the robe of righteousness
[1:15:56] as a bridegroom decath himself with
[1:16:00] ornaments and as a bride adorneth
[1:16:03] herself with her jewels
[1:16:06] oh brother this isn't something that we
[1:16:09] selected
[1:16:10] this isn't something that we went down
[1:16:12] to walmart or jc pennies or dealers or
[1:16:15] coals or belts or something in the
[1:16:17] selected but we have been dressed
[1:16:20] hallelujah in a garment that he selected

[1:16:26] the world oh my we have been adorned
[1:16:29] with his glory with his jewels with his

[1:16:46] this the feminine expression
[1:16:50] of himself amen
[1:16:53] right
[1:16:53] praise the lord
[1:16:56] james 1 chapter 27 you don't have to
[1:16:59] turn there
[1:17:00] but it says pure and undefiled religion
[1:17:02] is this
[1:17:03] to visit the fathers fatherless and the
[1:17:05] widows
[1:17:07] and to keep himself
[1:17:09] unspotted
[1:17:11] from the world
[1:17:13] we've got a great charge amen
[1:17:16] we've been dressed in robes of
[1:17:18] righteousness
[1:17:20] pure
[1:17:21] linen pure fine white linen which is the
[1:17:24] righteousness of saints the book of
[1:17:26] revelation says
[1:17:28] but once we've been dressed in that then
[1:17:30] our daily walk
[1:17:32] amen
[1:17:34] the path that we choose
[1:17:36] we must avoid the things that will spot
[1:17:40] and stain and mar
[1:17:43] the garments
[1:17:45] and when we should amen come in contact
[1:17:48] with something amen that puts a stain
[1:17:51] on our testimony
[1:17:53] we must immediately go for cleansing
[1:17:56] amen we must immediately go
[1:18:00] to the high priest
[1:18:02] to be cleansed and sanctified and to
[1:18:05] have our robes restored to their
[1:18:08] original condition
[1:18:10] amen i want to look this morning by the
[1:18:13] grace of god
[1:18:16] at the very quickly
[1:18:18] we are all familiar with the story of
[1:18:20] asking
[1:18:22] and how that came about when king of
[1:18:24] hazarus was displeased with the conduct
[1:18:29] of the queen vashta
[1:18:31] and because
[1:18:33] she exalted herself
[1:18:35] into a position that was inappropriate
[1:18:38] for her she challenged
[1:18:42] the beckoning of the king right
[1:18:45] she was rendered
[1:18:47] from the kingdom
[1:18:49] she was stripped of her position
[1:18:52] she was stripped of the crown
[1:18:55] and the royal robes
[1:18:57] that she had been dressed in
[1:18:59] to signify to the world that she held
[1:19:02] the position of the queen of the land
[1:19:05] and when this decree was made in the
[1:19:07] laws of means and persians
[1:19:10] then it was determined by the
[1:19:11] councillors
[1:19:13] that they would bring in
[1:19:15] the young maidens the young virgins
[1:19:17] there to be brought before the king for
[1:19:20] consideration as to who would become the
[1:19:22] next queen
[1:19:24] now if you recall the story
[1:19:26] there were many many young virgins
[1:19:30] that were
[1:19:31] eligible candidates
[1:19:33] that were qualified
[1:19:35] to come into
[1:19:37] the house
[1:19:40] of the of the virgins there
[1:19:43] the house of the young maidens
[1:19:45] and the bible says they were giving up
[1:19:46] one years of beauty one year beauty
[1:19:49] treatments six months of oil and myrrh
[1:19:52] and six months of all these things my
[1:19:54] they you know this was before the days
[1:19:56] of the ultimate makeover
[1:19:58] you know but you you can just see how
[1:20:00] they all
[1:20:01] they all were given the same
[1:20:04] treatment
[1:20:06] they were all given the same
[1:20:07] consideration
[1:20:09] they all had an equal opportunity
[1:20:13] to go before the king they were all
[1:20:16] virgins they were all qualified in that
[1:20:18] sense but here in esther chapter 2
[1:20:24] esther chapter 2
[1:20:29] verse 15
[1:20:30] remember
[1:20:32] regardless of how many dozens or how
[1:20:34] many hundreds or how many thousands
[1:20:37] of qualified candidates
[1:20:39] were to come in review
[1:20:42] before the king only one
[1:20:44] could be appointed to the throne
[1:20:48] so it was going to require something
[1:20:50] really special
[1:20:52] a man to attract the interest of the
[1:20:55] king
[1:20:56] and i think we can see here
[1:20:59] it was going to take more than beauty
[1:21:02] because no doubt they all
[1:21:04] were beautiful
[1:21:06] he was going to take even more than uh
[1:21:09] virtue because they were all
[1:21:11] virtuous
[1:21:13] maybe they had kept themselves pure
[1:21:16] and virtuous
[1:21:18] to be married someday and to be to be a
[1:21:20] suitable wife for a husband
[1:21:23] and here they're brought in
[1:21:25] consideration so it's going to take
[1:21:27] something more
[1:21:28] than her beauty
[1:21:30] he was going to take something more than
[1:21:31] even her virtue
[1:21:33] it was going to take an inward quality
[1:21:38] that only the king could recognize as
[1:21:41] being fit or suitable to make it to that
[1:21:45] throne
[1:21:46] and to share with his power amen to
[1:21:49] share his majesty to share his governing
[1:21:53] authority over that land amen right so
[1:21:56] the bible says in verse 15 of esther
[1:21:59] chapter 2 now when the turn of esther
[1:22:02] the daughter of abile the uncle of
[1:22:05] mordecai who had taken her for his
[1:22:07] daughter
[1:22:08] was come to go in unto the king look at
[1:22:12] this she required nothing
[1:22:17] she required nothing
[1:22:19] but what haggai the king's chamberlain
[1:22:24] and the keeper of the women appointed
[1:22:28] there was an appointed provision
[1:22:32] there was an appointed measure amen
[1:22:36] there was an appointed message
[1:22:38] amen there was an appointed word
[1:22:42] for
[1:22:42] esther
[1:22:44] and when she amen applied that word now
[1:22:48] it's one thing to have the garment it's
[1:22:50] another thing to have it hanging in your
[1:22:52] wardrobe it's another thing to pull it
[1:22:54] out and admire it every day
[1:22:56] it's another thing to have it on the
[1:22:57] books and tapes it's another thing to
[1:23:00] have it up on the shelf collecting dust
[1:23:03] but brother she had to put it on amen
[1:23:05] amen she dressed herself per the
[1:23:09] instruction of the prophet
[1:23:12] she dressed herself per the direction of
[1:23:16] higgy i who is a representative of the
[1:23:19] king and he had been challenged he had
[1:23:22] been charged with the responsibility
[1:23:26] of bringing before a hazarist a queen
[1:23:31] hallelujah
[1:23:33] how many virgins how many young maidens
[1:23:36] had come under the instruction of habeat
[1:23:40] how many young women had heard that
[1:23:43] message had seen those provisions and
[1:23:46] said i need something more
[1:23:51] that message isn't sufficient
[1:23:54] to satisfy what i believe it will take
[1:23:57] to appease the king
[1:24:00] so they had they heard the message
[1:24:03] they heard the word
[1:24:04] they heard the voice of the king's
[1:24:06] chamberlain
[1:24:08] and then they went out and said but
[1:24:10] amen
[1:24:11] i'll run down here
[1:24:14] to the cosmetics store
[1:24:16] and get some
[1:24:18] eyeliner you know
[1:24:21] i'll uh
[1:24:22] put a perm in my hair
[1:24:24] i'll get some highlights you know i'm
[1:24:25] not picking on the sisters you
[1:24:27] understand but look at the spiritual
[1:24:29] that's right they were never satisfied
[1:24:31] with the simplicity right
[1:24:33] of the revealed word amen
[1:24:36] it wasn't glittery enough for them
[1:24:38] it wasn't shiny enough for it
[1:24:40] it didn't stimulate their interest
[1:24:44] remember
[1:24:46] because they're all
[1:24:47] in their minds what will it take
[1:24:51] to
[1:24:51] catch the king's eye
[1:24:54] what will it take to differentiate
[1:24:57] me
[1:24:58] from the dozens or hundreds or thousands
[1:25:01] of other young sisters that will come
[1:25:04] and review
[1:25:05] so you know
[1:25:06] these these maybe women don't think like
[1:25:09] this i wouldn't
[1:25:10] know but if i were
[1:25:14] one of these young mates i would be
[1:25:15] thinking
[1:25:16] what
[1:25:18] i want to get in the mind of the king
[1:25:23] i want to get into his thoughts
[1:25:25] i'd be studying him
[1:25:27] i'd be reading on him i'd be looking at
[1:25:29] his history i'd be studying queen
[1:25:31] vashtai
[1:25:33] what was it about her that he didn't
[1:25:35] like
[1:25:36] what did he see in her initially that
[1:25:39] won his favor
[1:25:40] and then what surfaced later on
[1:25:44] to uh cause his refusal
[1:25:47] and dismissal of her i'd be saying that
[1:25:50] but you know ultimately it came down to
[1:25:52] that young that young lady she's
[1:25:54] thinking
[1:25:55] this
[1:25:56] will
[1:25:57] will set me apart
[1:26:00] you know i'll i'll get some of these
[1:26:01] special heels
[1:26:04] you know i i'll i'll go and have this
[1:26:07] dress altered
[1:26:09] to be a little more suited to my
[1:26:15] form or my you know
[1:26:17] makeup
[1:26:18] uh you know these things were given to
[1:26:20] me by my genetic makeup so i'll alter
[1:26:24] the dress to suit what i think in my
[1:26:27] mind will appease the king
[1:26:29] and that was what disqualified
[1:26:32] all of them
[1:26:38] no doubt as some of them just think
[1:26:40] about this now
[1:26:41] amongst
[1:26:42] with churches
[1:26:44] no doubt some of those
[1:26:46] beautiful
[1:26:47] virtuous
[1:26:49] young ladies would come before the king
[1:26:53] and no doubt if you could see the
[1:26:55] thought bubble
[1:26:56] above his head
[1:26:59] see i've got i've got to talk to haggai
[1:27:03] where did she get those heels
[1:27:09] where did she come up with that hairdo
[1:27:13] where did she get those
[1:27:15] gaudy earrings
[1:27:18] i mean they stood out in his mind but
[1:27:21] for all the wrong reasons
[1:27:23] they differentiated themselves they
[1:27:26] distinguished themselves but it was all
[1:27:28] for the wrong reasons
[1:27:30] i don't remember ever instructing heavy
[1:27:33] eye that way
[1:27:34] i don't remember ever giving those prada
[1:27:37] shoes
[1:27:39] for her to wear i don't ever remember
[1:27:41] that
[1:27:42] uh gucci purse you know or whatever
[1:27:45] where did she come up with those hard
[1:27:47] rim glasses that oh my goodness those
[1:27:50] don't suit her much less my taste you
[1:27:53] see what i'm saying but they were all
[1:27:55] making a special effort
[1:28:00] to dress up and snazz up the message
[1:28:04] or to deviate from the simplicity of its
[1:28:07] instructions
[1:28:09] because they wanted to be a little
[1:28:11] different than the rest
[1:28:12] oh god help us
[1:28:15] but esther
[1:28:17] required nothing
[1:28:19] but
[1:28:19] what had been appointed
[1:28:22] whatever he supplies
[1:28:24] is sufficient
[1:28:26] whatever he has
[1:28:29] given to dress me in is all i need
[1:28:33] i don't need the l'oreal i don't need
[1:28:36] the max factor i don't need the
[1:28:38] covergirl i don't need the cosmopolitan
[1:28:41] i don't need to borrow from the modern
[1:28:45] fashions and trends of this day to try
[1:28:48] to appease the king's taste or win his
[1:28:52] favor
[1:28:53] amen if what he has provided
[1:28:58] dressed upon me or adorned upon me isn't
[1:29:02] suitable to meet his favor then i simply
[1:29:05] won't meet his favor
[1:29:07] if what he provided and what he
[1:29:11] appointed isn't sufficient enough then
[1:29:13] so be it
[1:29:15] amen i believe as the bride of christ
[1:29:18] that's the attitude we need to have
[1:29:21] i don't need
[1:29:23] john hagee's
[1:29:25] message
[1:29:28] i don't need james dobson's
[1:29:36] psychology i don't need
[1:29:39] some trinitarian influence
[1:29:42] to come mix into the pot
[1:29:45] to become mixed into my religious
[1:29:48] formula
[1:29:49] to win god's approval and to make a
[1:29:52] rapture
[1:29:54] amen
[1:29:55] god has provided us with a message
[1:30:00] a rapture message he's provided us with
[1:30:04] the fullness of the revelation
[1:30:06] of who he is to enable us to come to the
[1:30:11] recognition of who we are as the
[1:30:14] feminine expression of himself
[1:30:18] and whatever he provides for that
[1:30:21] that daughter of god to wear
[1:30:23] will be sufficient
[1:30:24] for the bride
[1:30:26] now
[1:30:27] thank god
[1:30:29] esther had that inward quality
[1:30:32] she had character that was fit to rule
[1:30:37] you know i i would i would suppose that
[1:30:39] there were other
[1:30:42] other ladies other young sisters
[1:30:45] who by modern standards
[1:30:48] would look better
[1:30:50] would win the beauty contest
[1:30:53] but they were lacking the character
[1:30:56] and the character
[1:30:59] you can't put a price tag on that
[1:31:00] brother sister you can't put a value on
[1:31:03] that
[1:31:04] and he said that's what i need in the
[1:31:06] throne
[1:31:08] i don't want a jezebel that the kings of
[1:31:10] all the other countries are going to be
[1:31:12] nested after
[1:31:14] i don't need a jackie o'nasus or
[1:31:17] michelle or whatever you know some woman
[1:31:20] to lead the modern trends i need godly
[1:31:23] character and virtue
[1:31:25] here on the throne beside me
[1:31:28] something that will not detract from the
[1:31:31] glory of the king but something that
[1:31:33] will actually complement
[1:31:36] his glory and his rulership and his
[1:31:39] governing authority and long after he is
[1:31:42] the king their natural king is dead in
[1:31:44] god his legacy will live all look at his
[1:31:47] choice for companion look at his choice
[1:31:49] for what look at his choice for king and
[1:31:52] that character will be reflected
[1:31:55] throughout the subjects of his kingdom
[1:32:00] amen
[1:32:01] oh how many thank god that you've been
[1:32:03] selected
[1:32:04] amen how many thank god i'm so thankful
[1:32:07] brother and sister that the simplicity
[1:32:09] of the message is enough to satisfy my
[1:32:12] taste
[1:32:12] i don't need anything more i wouldn't
[1:32:15] settle for anything less amen he has
[1:32:19] provided us in this hour a garment that
[1:32:22] will win his favor
[1:32:24] by thinking of ruth and i'm trying to
[1:32:26] work toward it
[1:32:28] toward a goal here thinking of ruth
[1:32:31] there
[1:32:32] a moabitess
[1:32:34] a gentile
[1:32:36] completely outside
[1:32:41] of redemption amen
[1:32:43] completely outside the economy of god
[1:32:47] no
[1:32:49] uh no
[1:32:50] merits of her own
[1:32:52] nothing to earn
[1:32:56] any recognition or position
[1:32:59] you understand what i'm saying
[1:33:03] but just almost seeming like by chance
[1:33:05] or happenstance
[1:33:07] there
[1:33:08] naomi
[1:33:10] and elimelech and
[1:33:12] maelon and those sons went down into
[1:33:15] that
[1:33:16] gentile land and their ruth marries
[1:33:19] and then her husband dies and
[1:33:21] naomi's husband dies and the other
[1:33:24] ruth's
[1:33:26] comrade there her
[1:33:31] her friend there
[1:33:33] orpha
[1:33:34] her husband dies
[1:33:36] and here ruth finds herself
[1:33:39] with this
[1:33:40] desire with this attraction
[1:33:43] to her mother-in-law
[1:33:46] who is under redemption
[1:33:48] who does have rights who does have a
[1:33:51] place and a position
[1:33:54] in a promised land
[1:33:55] under a promise of almighty god jehovah
[1:33:58] to abraham and his seed after him naomi
[1:34:01] with this hope amen with this attraction
[1:34:06] to draw her back to the homeland then
[1:34:09] ruth finds an attraction within herself
[1:34:12] to naomi
[1:34:14] where you go i will go where you lodge i
[1:34:17] will lodge your people shall be my
[1:34:20] people and your god shall be my god so
[1:34:24] for reasons that ruth doesn't even
[1:34:26] understand necessarily she's saying
[1:34:28] things things are coming forth from her
[1:34:31] lips that even she doesn't comprehend
[1:34:33] she finds herself going down into a
[1:34:35] strange land and she finds herself out
[1:34:38] in this field gleaming and here comes
[1:34:41] boaz the king of the harvest and he's
[1:34:44] riding all on this white horse and he
[1:34:47] spots ruth there gleaning in the field
[1:34:50] and she grabs his eye she attracts his
[1:34:54] attention and there she goes back in
[1:34:56] this great love affair amen begins to be
[1:35:00] kindled between ruth and boaz
[1:35:03] and notice she has to go home to naomi
[1:35:06] to receive teaching
[1:35:08] to receive instruction
[1:35:10] to be able to begin to understand the
[1:35:13] laws of redemption
[1:35:16] and it comes down here in ruth chapter
[1:35:18] 3.
[1:35:20] let's just read it there together i hope
[1:35:22] this isn't too much scripture for you
[1:35:23] this morning
[1:35:25] but there's a great love story unfolding
[1:35:28] here that's going to be a type of a
[1:35:31] great invisible union between a gentile
[1:35:35] bride a man
[1:35:36] and christ the son of god
[1:35:39] the bible says in route 3 chapter 1
[1:35:41] naomi is a type of israel the bible says
[1:35:43] then they owe me her mother-in-law said
[1:35:45] unto her my daughter shall i not seek
[1:35:48] rest for thee that it may be well with
[1:35:51] thee and now is not boaz of our kindred
[1:35:57] with whose maidens thou wast oh my you
[1:36:00] were right there in there with the
[1:36:02] churches
[1:36:03] you were right there gathered with the
[1:36:04] other denominations
[1:36:06] these amen we're candidates to become
[1:36:09] wise to boaz
[1:36:11] behold
[1:36:12] he went to its barley tonight in the
[1:36:15] threshing floor
[1:36:17] now ruth has no comprehension
[1:36:21] of the significance of the things that
[1:36:24] naomi is fixing to tell her
[1:36:27] but in verse 3
[1:36:29] naomi says wash thyself therefore
[1:36:32] and anoint thee
[1:36:34] and put
[1:36:36] thy raiment upon thee
[1:36:39] and get thee down to the floor
[1:36:42] but make not thyself known until the man
[1:36:46] until
[1:36:47] he shall have done
[1:36:48] eating and drinking
[1:36:51] shall be when he lieth down
[1:36:56] that thou shalt mark the place where he
[1:36:59] shall lie
[1:37:02] and thou shalt go in
[1:37:04] and uncover his feet
[1:37:07] and lay thee down
[1:37:11] and
[1:37:12] he
[1:37:13] will temple thee
[1:37:15] what
[1:37:16] thou
[1:37:17] shalt
[1:37:18] do
[1:37:20] now this in many regards
[1:37:22] was somewhat of a risky
[1:37:25] amen
[1:37:27] proposition right
[1:37:29] for ruth to go down here and do this
[1:37:33] was a 50 50 chance that it would either
[1:37:35] go very bad right
[1:37:37] or very well right
[1:37:41] and ruth doesn't even understand perhaps
[1:37:43] the
[1:37:44] the consequences
[1:37:46] or the full breadth of the risk that
[1:37:49] she's taking here
[1:37:53] but she trusts naomi she says in verse 5
[1:37:57] she said unto her all that thou sayest
[1:38:00] unto me i will do
[1:38:02] and she went down into the floor
[1:38:05] and did according to all that her
[1:38:07] mother-in-law baker
[1:38:10] when boaz had eaten and drunk and his
[1:38:12] heart was married
[1:38:14] he went to lie down at the end of the
[1:38:17] heap of corn
[1:38:19] and she came softly
[1:38:22] and uncovered his feet
[1:38:25] and laid her down
[1:38:28] and it came to pass at midnight
[1:38:31] that the man was afraid
[1:38:33] and turned himself
[1:38:35] and behold a woman lay at his feet
[1:38:40] and he said who art thou
[1:38:44] now think of this it's dark it's pitch
[1:38:46] black he can't see a thing she can't see
[1:38:48] it she knows of who he is but he has no
[1:38:51] idea at this point who she is
[1:38:54] and so in the middle of the night he
[1:38:56] wakes up someone's lying at his feet
[1:38:59] he sits up he looks down he says who art
[1:39:02] thou
[1:39:02] and she answered i am ruth
[1:39:06] thine handmaid
[1:39:07] watch this spread
[1:39:10] therefore
[1:39:11] thy skirt
[1:39:14] over

[1:39:17] for the apple heart a near cancer

[1:40:01] relationship right hallelujah by a

[1:40:08] married him but now he's dead
[1:40:10] amen and i have been admitted back into
[1:40:14] a country and back into a land and now i
[1:40:18] realize i am kin to you amen hallelujah
[1:40:22] you have become kin to me the great god
[1:40:25] of glory elohim laid down his kingly
[1:40:29] garments and he came to earth and took
[1:40:32] all the robe of flesh and he became a
[1:40:36] sinner he became sin i should say
[1:40:39] because he that knew no sin became sin
[1:40:43] for us amen
[1:40:45] he became sin he became in the likeness
[1:40:49] of human flesh to redeem back a jewish
[1:40:53] bride who had forfeited him that's right
[1:40:56] hallelujah
[1:40:58] and here comes a gentile bride
[1:41:01] and she says i recognize

[1:41:07] you are the third person
[1:41:09] you are god you wrote yourself in flesh
[1:41:14] to become a near kinsman speech
[1:41:17] and now she is requesting amen she is
[1:41:21] pleading stretch forth your majesty

[1:41:45] by the jewish pride was too open and
[1:41:48] tolerant of opportunity for you and i
[1:41:52] totally totally separated from the
[1:41:54] economy

[1:42:17] that satan had tried
[1:42:20] to pervert our minds and understanding
[1:42:22] a revealed word is unfolded in this hour
[1:42:25] amen to bring us right to the feet
[1:42:29] of the king

[1:42:34] of the scholars
[1:42:36] some of the you know great minds of
[1:42:38] religion
[1:42:39] supposed that this was some form of
[1:42:42] seduction or this was some form of
[1:42:44] enticement all roots part nothing could
[1:42:46] be further from the truth
[1:42:48] this was a holy act
[1:42:50] of redemption
[1:42:52] this was a holy request on her
[1:42:54] part showing that she recognized who he
[1:42:58] was
[1:42:59] and what he could do on her behalf
[1:43:03] and not even fully comprehending the
[1:43:05] significance of this she was requesting
[1:43:08] redemption that's right she was
[1:43:10] requesting him amen
[1:43:12] oh my at all cost

[1:44:53] he will not
[1:44:55] rest
[1:44:57] until the work is complete
[1:44:59] until that last name from the lamb's
[1:45:02] book of life has come to that
[1:45:05] recognition
[1:45:07] and realizes he has spread his spirit of
[1:45:10] redemption
[1:45:12] and when the last name that was on that
[1:45:15] last book of life comes to that
[1:45:17] realization brother that a change is

[1:45:21] great resurrection then a great
[1:45:23] gathering time for 30 to 40 days we'll
[1:45:26] gather in a realm in a place a man in a
[1:45:31] realm that's unseen and unacknowledged
[1:45:34] and unrecognized by the world but it'll
[1:45:36] be a pavilion
[1:45:38] it'll be a place
[1:45:40] hallelujah it'll be a great gathering
[1:45:42] time right so that when he appears
[1:45:46] all eyes
[1:45:47] will be upon him
[1:45:49] i want to sing a song what a day that
[1:45:51] will be
[1:45:53] with my jesus i shall see
[1:45:56] brother brown says the very one you've
[1:45:57] worshipped will become personalized
[1:45:59] before you
[1:46:00] in the form of the holy ghost
[1:46:03] then you and he are one amen
[1:46:05] and
[1:46:06] all the hymns in the beginning we'll go
[1:46:08] back to the beginning
[1:46:10] wonderful wonderful jesus is to me
[1:46:13] can i continue on just for a few more
[1:46:14] moments
[1:46:16] amen so far brother nobody's sleeping
[1:46:18] praise the lord
[1:46:20] amen
[1:46:22] god is good to us brother
[1:46:24] sister god has done a marvelous thing in
[1:46:28] this hour
[1:46:31] i'm just thinking here
[1:46:34] we're living in an hour you know billy
[1:46:36] bennett preached the message
[1:46:38] he's the rising of the sun he spoke a
[1:46:40] quickening power
[1:46:41] spoke of the dynamics how it's required
[1:46:45] to strike those mechanics
[1:46:47] to have one without the other
[1:46:49] used to have a motionless
[1:46:51] automobile
[1:46:53] right amen right we must have the
[1:46:56] mechanics of the word we must have those
[1:46:58] doctrines right we must have those
[1:47:00] truths correctly placed in the word of
[1:47:02] god that's what the ministry of elijah
[1:47:04] did was restore the altar
[1:47:07] so that the fire of god the dynamics
[1:47:10] could come and quicken that's right and
[1:47:14] bring to life and to bring to
[1:47:16] manifestation that sacrifice upon the
[1:47:18] altar which was you and i amen
[1:47:22] we talked about two cadillacs
[1:47:24] one
[1:47:27] having no spark the other having sparked
[1:47:29] both identical and feature
[1:47:32] both identical in construction both
[1:47:35] identical in looks and appearance and
[1:47:37] even
[1:47:38] oh and function but one lacking the
[1:47:40] dynamics
[1:47:42] one lacking the power required
[1:47:45] to strike that gasoline that potential
[1:47:48] and to bring forth the manifestation of
[1:47:51] that octane amen
[1:47:53] to release and unleash that power that
[1:47:56] lay within that fuel
[1:47:58] so we got two cadillacs there
[1:48:00] and in this hour we've got a group that
[1:48:04] call themselves the queen of heaven
[1:48:08] we have
[1:48:10] a group that calls themselves the bride
[1:48:13] and in the church ages book brother
[1:48:14] brother says they will be held
[1:48:16] accountable
[1:48:17] as bright because they called themselves
[1:48:21] and proclaimed and professed himself to
[1:48:23] be right
[1:48:25] but there is also
[1:48:27] a true bride that's right an elected
[1:48:30] brother amen a predestinated bride
[1:48:34] with
[1:48:35] his virtue and character dwelling on the
[1:48:38] inside of her come on
[1:48:41] brother says this
[1:48:43] just looking for a moment at satan's
[1:48:45] bride
[1:48:46] but it says notice satan
[1:48:49] is not called the god of any other age
[1:48:52] but this age
[1:48:53] it was his ambition to be like god from
[1:48:56] the very beginning
[1:48:58] and he goes into isaiah 14
[1:49:00] how art thou fallen from heaven oh
[1:49:02] lucifer son of the morning how art thou
[1:49:04] cast
[1:49:05] down to the ground which did weaken the
[1:49:08] nations for thou has said in thy heart i
[1:49:10] will ascend into heaven i will exalt my
[1:49:14] throne above the stars of god and
[1:49:16] brother brown says sons of god
[1:49:19] do you realize satan's desire was to be
[1:49:22] exalted above you
[1:49:25] the stars of god represented was
[1:49:27] symbolic of the sons of god
[1:49:30] and in satan's desire and ambition to
[1:49:33] elevate himself above you and i he was
[1:49:36] cast down
[1:49:38] i will exalt my throne above the stars
[1:49:40] of god the red says the sons of god now
[1:49:44] and i will set also upon the mount of
[1:49:46] the congregation in the sides of the
[1:49:48] north and brother brennan says it was
[1:49:50] satan's ambition to be worshipped like
[1:49:53] god
[1:49:54] he took two-thirds of the stars of
[1:49:56] heaven
[1:49:57] ascended himself above those stars
[1:50:00] and preached
[1:50:02] to them
[1:50:03] reckoned what he preached
[1:50:05] yeah yet god said
[1:50:07] yeah yeah hath god says what he always
[1:50:09] preaches
[1:50:11] it is written right he preaches an
[1:50:14] intellectual
[1:50:16] understanding
[1:50:17] of the written word of god
[1:50:22] he deceived two-thirds of them preached
[1:50:24] to them to see two-thirds of them you
[1:50:26] see it all right now that's his ambition
[1:50:29] and now he is ready
[1:50:32] with his careful selected
[1:50:35] educated bride
[1:50:37] by his own knowledge see
[1:50:42] all painted up in his deceit of big
[1:50:45] buildings and big denominations and
[1:50:48] paints of knowledge and theology and
[1:50:51] smart and intellectual and educated to
[1:50:55] deceive the whole world and become a god
[1:50:58] that's what he's done
[1:51:00] that's what he's done all heading up
[1:51:03] into the person of the antichrist
[1:51:06] which is already crowned the viker of
[1:51:09] god
[1:51:10] listen to this in
[1:51:12] by how was he crowned
[1:51:14] by his worldly loving
[1:51:18] scientific bride
[1:51:20] all dressed up in pop of intellectual
[1:51:25] religious
[1:51:27] education
[1:51:30] she is made religious like
[1:51:32] him and by his own interpretation
[1:51:37] of the word of god
[1:51:39] as he did eve
[1:51:42] and as his son
[1:51:44] cain did
[1:51:47] how did how did satan deceive
[1:51:50] eve
[1:51:52] he enticed her
[1:51:54] using her mind
[1:51:56] eve
[1:51:58] just putting it into paraphrasing
[1:52:01] do you know your purpose
[1:52:04] do you know why god formed you
[1:52:07] and brought you into existence here on
[1:52:10] the earth
[1:52:12] you have potentials right
[1:52:14] you have abilities right right
[1:52:18] there there are power there's a power
[1:52:20] that lies within you
[1:52:21] should give birth
[1:52:24] has adam ever told you about this well
[1:52:25] no
[1:52:26] because it wasn't time yet
[1:52:29] so satan
[1:52:31] revealed to her
[1:52:34] her purpose
[1:52:36] using her body which was a creation of
[1:52:38] god
[1:52:40] but to accomplish his own objectives
[1:52:44] and means which was to sow his seed of
[1:52:47] discrepancy into creation
[1:52:50] amen
[1:52:51] so he come along
[1:52:53] using god's creation was his bible is
[1:52:55] that right
[1:52:57] his creation was in the stars
[1:52:59] and then nature but the premise of
[1:53:01] nature was his first bible right so
[1:53:04] satan came and used a bible used god's
[1:53:08] creation but he twisted its intent and
[1:53:12] meaning to accomplish his own objectives
[1:53:16] his own motives but in doing so he threw
[1:53:19] the entire creation into a simple state
[1:53:23] right now he does the same in this hour
[1:53:26] now he remember this and take note of
[1:53:29] this
[1:53:30] eve
[1:53:31] was
[1:53:32] naked
[1:53:33] but with a holy veil the prophet said
[1:53:36] she had no knowledge or comprehension of
[1:53:39] her condition right but
[1:53:42] satan came to her to entice her to
[1:53:46] become as a god
[1:53:48] she was already a god she was already an
[1:53:51] amateur god amen with co-equal with adam
[1:53:54] so satan used her very position
[1:53:58] to to work against her and to make her a
[1:54:01] god he rendered her naked
[1:54:03] because once his revelation that he gave
[1:54:06] her came into fruition she realized i'm
[1:54:09] naked that's right
[1:54:11] and then she began to try to clothe
[1:54:14] herself
[1:54:15] now satan does the same thing with his
[1:54:18] bride in this hour
[1:54:20] we read in revelations 3 you don't have
[1:54:22] to turn there
[1:54:24] but this laodicean church has
[1:54:27] in her mind
[1:54:29] which is satan's battleground in her
[1:54:31] mind she has an idea or a perception of
[1:54:36] how she appears
[1:54:41] i'm rich
[1:54:42] increased with goods
[1:54:44] and have need of
[1:54:47] nothing
[1:54:49] that's her mental understanding that has
[1:54:52] been given to her by her god right satan
[1:54:56] all right you are beautiful you are
[1:54:58] clothed you are acceptable in the sight
[1:55:01] of god you're fine just go on the way
[1:55:04] you're going worship the way you're
[1:55:06] worshiping believe the way you're
[1:55:08] believing how could a holy and righteous
[1:55:10] and just god cast you into the lake of
[1:55:13] fire with all your beautiful
[1:55:15] denominations and glitter and gold and
[1:55:18] all the pop and splendor that but when
[1:55:20] god looks at her he says i know thy
[1:55:23] works
[1:55:25] i don't care what your profession is i
[1:55:28] see your hearts i see your actions i see
[1:55:32] your conduct i see your works
[1:55:36] and i say
[1:55:39] you don't even realize it but you're
[1:55:41] naked
[1:55:43] you're wretched you're poor you're
[1:55:45] miserable and you're blind right but you
[1:55:48] have been weaved a web of deceit
[1:55:52] so much so that you're in a
[1:55:53] disillusioned state
[1:55:55] you're in a deluded state of believing
[1:55:58] you are covered
[1:55:59] and believing you're clothed
[1:56:01] now think about
[1:56:02] the preview of the bride
[1:56:05] brother brown said he'd been in pig
[1:56:06] alley
[1:56:08] rome
[1:56:10] france
[1:56:11] new york city los angeles but he said
[1:56:15] the filthiest bunch of women i've ever
[1:56:18] seen in my life
[1:56:19] is jeffersonville indiana
[1:56:22] i've never seen so much gom and filth in
[1:56:24] my life as i see amongst them people he
[1:56:28] said he'd been in a shopping center
[1:56:29] right there in jeffersonville
[1:56:31] he said i sat there till my heart ached
[1:56:34] and the lord had given me a vision
[1:56:36] this is in the masterpiece 1964 he says
[1:56:38] now i'm going to tell the vision i don't
[1:56:40] know that i could interpret it but i'm
[1:56:42] going to television for my first time i
[1:56:45] failed into a trance and when i did
[1:56:48] there was somebody with me i didn't see
[1:56:50] the person it was just a voice
[1:56:53] and i looked and as i looked this way he
[1:56:55] said the bride
[1:56:57] will come in view for preview
[1:57:00] and i looked coming to me
[1:57:03] and i seen the most prettiest bunch of
[1:57:06] clean dressed
[1:57:08] women i had i had ever seen in my life
[1:57:12] but each one of them looked like was
[1:57:15] dressed
[1:57:16] different
[1:57:18] they all had long hair
[1:57:21] and they were longer sleeves and skirts
[1:57:23] and so forth young women
[1:57:26] and they looked kind about say maybe
[1:57:28] about 20.
[1:57:31] now i want you to realize you know satan
[1:57:33] comes and he really gives his sisters a
[1:57:35] hard time
[1:57:37] the preachers is always bearing down on
[1:57:39] you the women haters
[1:57:41] but
[1:57:42] if you can realize
[1:57:44] it's the position you hold
[1:57:47] and it's what you are
[1:57:51] remember representing
[1:57:51] bride is feminine in designation
[1:57:56] but she's the feminine part of him right
[1:58:00] so brother babin says if you want to
[1:58:02] know the condition the church look at
[1:58:03] the women
[1:58:04] she's a representation
[1:58:07] of
[1:58:08] the bride whether it be christ bright or
[1:58:11] satan's right you understand
[1:58:13] so it's what you're representing you you
[1:58:15] have a sacred trust
[1:58:17] and then you have a tremendous
[1:58:19] charge that's been given to you
[1:58:21] brotherham says now i have the bible
[1:58:22] open here before me see
[1:58:24] i can only say what i see
[1:58:26] if you say what are you looking at
[1:58:28] looking at a clock what are you looking
[1:58:30] for i'm looking for people looking at
[1:58:32] people what are you looking at i'm
[1:58:34] looking at the bible
[1:58:36] i'm telling the truth that's what i see
[1:58:39] and i can only say what i see i don't
[1:58:41] know what all about it i just have to
[1:58:44] tell you
[1:58:45] but when this
[1:58:46] bride she was looking right at
[1:58:50] the one was talking to me and standing
[1:58:52] together her eyes
[1:58:54] she was the cleanest
[1:58:57] sweetest looking people i ever seen in
[1:59:00] my life
[1:59:01] look like it could have been a dozen or
[1:59:03] more i don't know how many was abreast
[1:59:05] but there was just a group of them
[1:59:08] and she passed by sweetly with the air
[1:59:11] in their eyes up watching as she passed
[1:59:14] by all she was beautiful i looked at her
[1:59:19] and as she passed by he said
[1:59:23] now we shall review
[1:59:25] he said that's the bride
[1:59:28] now
[1:59:29] we will
[1:59:30] review
[1:59:32] the churches
[1:59:33] now this is just like king of hazarus
[1:59:38] that's right
[1:59:40] and here's the chamberlain
[1:59:44] standing there and the voice is with him
[1:59:48] in there watching
[1:59:50] these come before
[1:59:52] the king
[1:59:54] for consideration and now remember the
[1:59:56] prophet doesn't think his own thoughts
[1:59:58] doesn't see his own sights he has seen
[2:00:02] this as god
[2:00:03] caesar are you with me
[2:00:06] he's watching this he's seeing these
[2:00:08] come into preview and he's viewing them
[2:00:11] as god because a prophet is the eyes of
[2:00:14] god amen
[2:00:16] and he says she's the sweetest cleanest
[2:00:19] cleanest sweetest looking people so
[2:00:21] that's the bride now we will review the
[2:00:23] churches and they come
[2:00:26] i notice them coming up
[2:00:28] and when they come up each one look like
[2:00:30] got worse
[2:00:32] i never seen such a filthy bunch
[2:00:36] in my life
[2:00:38] and when he said next i heard a noise
[2:00:41] and it said next
[2:00:43] said here comes the
[2:00:45] american group
[2:00:50] now i'm an american
[2:00:52] but this just made me sick
[2:00:55] i am not eloquent enough in a mixed
[2:00:58] audience to say what was taking place
[2:01:01] you'll have to read between the lines
[2:01:03] but when the women were coming
[2:01:05] the leader of them was a witch
[2:01:10] she had a great long nose
[2:01:12] and a great big mouth
[2:01:14] and all of them was dressed with some
[2:01:16] kind of lower clothes down here but the
[2:01:19] top just had a strap that just
[2:01:21] a little about half inch strap that
[2:01:23] moved up and went around them like this
[2:01:25] and each woman had something on the
[2:01:27] order you remember years ago you still
[2:01:29] remember we cut the paper you don't use
[2:01:31] paper and make an old fly bush how many
[2:01:34] remembers it you know and i think they
[2:01:36] used it in carnivals you know hanging
[2:01:38] down like that fringe paper lace paper
[2:01:40] they had something holding below them
[2:01:43] like this holding below them all of this
[2:01:45] part was exposed and each one had hair
[2:01:49] cut up real short and frizzy looking
[2:01:52] things all over it like that real
[2:01:54] shortcut hair and full of makeup
[2:01:56] absolutely nothing but look like street
[2:01:59] prostitutes
[2:02:01] now remember in that era of time
[2:02:04] women weren't dressed in this way yet
[2:02:09] the fashions the trends all these things
[2:02:11] hadn't developed to this level of
[2:02:14] vulgarity
[2:02:15] but the prophet seeing a vision
[2:02:18] and the vision is not only showing the
[2:02:20] natural state of the american women but
[2:02:23] it's showing the condition that the
[2:02:26] modern churches are going into
[2:02:29] you understand that
[2:02:30] i was just talking with a sister a few
[2:02:32] weeks ago
[2:02:33] she was raised in the mountains of west
[2:02:35] virginia her parents only got
[2:02:37] electricity a few years before they died
[2:02:39] and she told me that she moved from west
[2:02:41] virginia to north carolina to a city
[2:02:43] there called winston-salem she said
[2:02:45] brother tim i worked in a factory i
[2:02:48] worked in a factory she said i was
[2:02:50] unsaved she said but i wore
[2:02:53] sunday clothes i wore formal clothes
[2:02:56] from my home to the factory
[2:02:59] she said when i got to the factory then
[2:03:01] i would go into the changing room and
[2:03:03] train change out of my formal wear into
[2:03:06] a uniform
[2:03:08] a factory workers uniform like coveralls
[2:03:11] or something of that nature she said i
[2:03:13] worked all day in the factory and then
[2:03:15] before going home i went back and
[2:03:17] changed into a dress
[2:03:20] and a blouse and some type of formal
[2:03:22] shoes now this was the united states of
[2:03:24] america
[2:03:25] probably in the 60s
[2:03:28] lord about today you hear brother brown
[2:03:30] say if a woman dressed if the woman went
[2:03:32] out on the street like that 20 years ago
[2:03:33] she had been locked up forbid and say
[2:03:35] that's the truth friends
[2:03:37] that's the truth
[2:03:39] look at how the dress of the people has
[2:03:42] degraded
[2:03:44] to such a condition now and here the
[2:03:45] prophet seeing it 40 years 50 years
[2:03:48] before it even manifests but
[2:03:51] it's showing the spiritual condition
[2:03:54] are you with me still
[2:03:58] they looked nothing but look like street
[2:04:00] prostitutes and there they were walking
[2:04:02] with this paper and the vulgarity now
[2:04:04] the paper what was hold in front of them
[2:04:07] but when they passed the review stead in
[2:04:09] the back of them and to see the way they
[2:04:12] were going on
[2:04:14] in their foremost in their back part and
[2:04:16] how they were acting i thought
[2:04:18] is that the church
[2:04:21] and there she went and they were singing
[2:04:24] this here twist and roll songs you know
[2:04:26] whatever what you call going down
[2:04:28] singing like going behind i said is that
[2:04:31] the church and i was standing there and
[2:04:34] in my heart
[2:04:36] i was crying remember brother brown was
[2:04:39] feeling the charge he's feeling the
[2:04:41] burden as the king's chamberlain he was
[2:04:44] accountable to how these women were
[2:04:47] presented before the review of the king
[2:04:50] so he's crying in his heart and he said
[2:04:52] and this witch to my notion it's nothing
[2:04:55] else in the world but she's that world
[2:04:58] council of churches leading them right
[2:05:00] straight down the road where she was
[2:05:02] going they went off to the left
[2:05:06] and disappeared
[2:05:08] in chaos
[2:05:11] still beating this music and making real
[2:05:14] funny sounds and shaking their bodies
[2:05:16] one side into the other side and then
[2:05:18] like that carrying on like that walking
[2:05:20] and i started to bow my head
[2:05:23] and he said wait
[2:05:25] the bride must come again
[2:05:29] remember that first bride he went on
[2:05:31] later to explain that was the alpha
[2:05:33] that was the early
[2:05:35] christian church
[2:05:37] she started off with the standard of
[2:05:39] holiness
[2:05:41] she started off with the baptism in the
[2:05:43] name of the lord jesus christ
[2:05:45] she started off with the baptism of the
[2:05:47] holy ghost and signs and wonders
[2:05:49] following
[2:05:51] and the way he started her
[2:05:53] the way he dressed her there on the day
[2:05:55] of pentecost and provided the holy
[2:05:58] spirit his robe of righteousness over is
[2:06:01] the same way he's going to finish your
[2:06:02] way
[2:06:03] amen the bride must come again and i
[2:06:07] looked and here they come again and as
[2:06:10] they passed by sweet looking little
[2:06:12] ladies they was all looking right at me
[2:06:17] as they pass by
[2:06:19] hey
[2:06:19] amen
[2:06:21] they required nothing
[2:06:23] but what the king's chamberlain
[2:06:25] appointed them
[2:06:26] oh

[2:06:29] of god amen coming through the lips of
[2:06:32] the seventh angel messenger brother we
[2:06:34] need to keep our eyes on that
[2:06:36] that's christ in the form of his word if
[2:06:39] we will stay with our eyes on the mirror
[2:06:43] of god's word
[2:06:44] we will find very quickly whether or not
[2:06:46] we meet the requirements of that message
[2:06:49] because that is the only thing that will
[2:06:51] permit to be going into his presence

[2:07:25] of long hair hanging down and they had
[2:07:26] rolled around like this might have been
[2:07:28] german or something like that and i
[2:07:30] watched them and
[2:07:31] they started leaving two or three of
[2:07:33] them in the back get out of step and i
[2:07:35] was going to holler at them
[2:07:37] and they was trying to get back and step
