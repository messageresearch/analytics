8 Ephesians 1 and First Kings 8 enjoyed that song Because amen I believe the greatest miracle that could ever be brought right amen is for God to birth a child into his kingdom the change of the body and all that's on account of that that's that just comes because of being what it is the greatest of all is the birth into the kingdom amen we appreciate it amen just remember now brother prash will be with us on the 15th so just remember that and remember the sisters will be leaving uh Sunday to go to their time there in Pigeon forwards and just keep these things in mind and just pray one for another now we we passed out the things about the the uh the tapes and the getting and was talking to Richard about it and see the ones he was making for way of Wade's Services is for those that are not able to be downstairs in the service you know but now if anybody wants Wade Services let me know all right see if you want the services of wagees to the Sunday school let me know because that way we can write it down or make sure you let Richard know where we can get that together if you won wait Sunday school Services made for you but the reason we we just that was just being made basically on the point of some that you know wasn't able to be downstairs it was up here uh making them you know for people that was doing their their jobs up here but if you want them if you want the services of Wade we just some way goofed up and didn't get that put on there to uh where would be covering everything about the tapes and we appreciate all of you doing that cuz it'll help us now to get everything back in o water from downstairs cuz we really it's been a mess getting everything to go but at least you know we are getting it back in place amen so just remember that thank you for all things and all the help and everything you know and we really appreciate Brother Gary he he's put in a lot of effort to work and to change things around here and to do and all like that and we certainly certainly do appreciate it we appreciate everything that everybody does because you're doing it for the glory of the Lord and everything and just do that amen so let's just pray before we read the scriptures I believe that's all the announcements but anyhow father we thank you we love you we just ask you to have your way with each one of us in our hearts and our lives Lord bless each one be with Wade and June as they're traveling back tomorrow and just bless him today there in the service and give him you know honor for you Lord cuz he's speaking in your behalf so you come on the scene there as we tried to talk about the manifestation of the Sons and Daughters of God that he's trying to make you known so you come on the scene and do signs and wonders to make known your your ministry Lord we ask you for that here also to have your way way with each one of us forgive our sins lead us and keep us Lord because we walk in the light of Your Love guide us now in Jesus name amen amen Ephesians 1 blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who has blessed us with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places in Christ according as he has chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he hath made us accepted in the Beloved now let's just go back and read here in First Kings it's kind of where we left off this morning of the coming into the thing and I want to make sure and emphasize a scripture that's in here because some people may read that and say well brother Dale you was off this morning well all right we'll we'll read it and then Express cuz I said that the the Ark of the Covenant when it was brought in you know was the the two tables of stone but there were Side Pockets you read There were Side Pockets that had the other five books in it but when it's listed here it says that there was nothing in the ark save the two tables of stone well that's in the Ark part to where it's made out the others were side pockets in the carrying and in doing the things that Moses had put in there so you know just remember that and then that way somebody come along say look at that you missed it well we might not have missed it so let's go to to First Kings 8 in verse one then Solomon assembled the Elders of Israel and all the heads of the tribes the chief of the fathers of the children of Israel unto King Solomon in Jerusalem that they might bring up the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord out of the city of David which is Zion and all the men of Israel assembled themselves unto King Solomon at the feast in the month eaman which is the seventh month that's really um it's the 7th month 10th day is the same as Leviticus 23 all right and all the Elders of Israel came and the priest took up the ark and they brought up the Ark of the Lord and the Tabernacle of the congregation and all the holy vessels that were in the Tabernacle even those did the priests and the Levites bring up and King Solomon and all the congregation of Israel that were assembled unto him were with him before the ark sacrificing sheep deep in Oxen that could not be told nor numbered for multitude and the priest brought in the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord unto his place into the orley of the house to the most holy place even under the wings of the cherubims for the cherin spread forth their two Wings over the place of the Ark and the churin covered the ark and the stays thereof above and they drew out the staves that the end of The Stave were seen out in the holy and they Drew out the stays that the ends of the stays were seen out in the Holy place before the orley and they were not seen without throughout the stage then as they I'm I'm reading seeing out all right but without and there they are unto this day there was nothing in the ark save the two tables of stone which Moses put there in horb when the Lord made a covenant with the children of Israel when they came out of the land of Egypt and it came to pass when the priests were come out of the Holy place that the cloud filled the house of the Lord so that the priest could not stand to minister because of the cloud for the glory of the Lord had filled the house of the Lord you may be seated the Lord at his Blessing to the reading of the word now you may have two sets on one of these it's like 26 27 28 29 so don't worry about it but there is some quotes on the other side we need so you know just have the one there to to give out because it just be an addition to what we're talking about now we are trying to bring a point to get us to a position to understand uh this this part of adoption and the part that we're referring to is the part of that the scripture says in Romans 8 uh 1921 right through there that it's talking about that the whole world is waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God all now that is a special position of adoption it is a a placing and I've told you what I believe that is and we've read some things this morning showing the different things and talking about it because see the one thing that is in this time and this day is the coming of The Headstone there is a headstone promise to this uh Generation all right and I believe that that is your adoption I will cover in another message more how that the relationship between brother bram's adoption as the relationship of the Lord Jesus's adoption and then we must come in there as to not just talk about what they done or whatever we must have our own all right we'll get to that but uh I'm trying to just get you to look at the word restor or restoration it's restitution in the book of Acts but the word there is to restore and we know that then you go through in the Bible and there's a lot talks about to restore Joel spoke of of restore all things uh Matthew spoke of of a Time coming that Elijah would come and restore all things and tying together the uh the entire our thing to that it would come out to the end and we saw then the one thing that we're needing is The Headstone because that would be the uh placing and finishing or the adoption of the individual is the head uniting with the body and in doing that then see we can talk about restoration this is the only age this is my whole point all right the only age that is promised full restoration is this age see the reason it is because restore means to restore what was originally here now we're not talking about what was here we're not talking about what was here in Jesus we are but when that is restored it won't be restored in Jesus it'll be restored in a group of people upon the Earth that will bring about a change of the body so restoration we're just talking of the simple things a lot of people misunderstand us because of the wordings we use maybe but we're simply talking about the word of God being revealed right I mean that's that's just simple to me as as whatever can be you can say well we've got the Bible that's right we read it and found a Trinity right that wasn't in it there was no such thing we found eternal hell there was no such thing we found all kind of justifications for whatever we thought we needed but those things are incorrect so did we understand the Bible yes we've had the letter of the Bible but having the letter of the Bible or having the letter of the message is not restoration when I'm talking about restoration I'm talking about the revealed word Jesus was the word made alive right he was not just a dead letter but around said his body laid in the Tomb he said waiting for life to come back to it that was the word lay there right right but it took the spirit to make it life see all right when I talk about word and I'm not talking about just letters on the page whether it be the prophet's message or letters coming off of it into uh MP3 CDs Etc DVDs or whatever you talking about I'm talking about when it's revealed amen now there was a time we thought we're supposed to baptize Father Son and Holy Ghost CU we read it well I can read it right out of the book but then when we got the Revelation right we didn't have to race out that and change the letters you know to make it fit something we seen it was saying exactly what it was supposed to say we had the wrong Revelation right cuz we swore we had a revelation didn't we it's been revealed to me that there's three Gods people will say you know and I get up to heaven if I don't see three I'll just walk out because it's the wrong place well I don't think you got to worry about it but that's all right you know we're not throwing stones at nobody we're just talking about you and me I'm not preaching out there I'm preaching here so don't ever getet that brother Dale is throwing off on these denomination over here that's over there I don't have no problems with them my problem is preaching to me and you I don't have no problem what's on the internet but I am not an internet Pastor if people listening you take it do what you want to with it but I'm not your pastor see all right because see there is people who say well well you're the only one I listen to well if there a church around for you to go to you know what I said to you you go to that church amen cuz the same thing applies to you as appes to anybody else forsake not to sending of yourself together well now brother Dale we assemble in front of the internet and we listen to you I've made it plain now that doesn't work with me if there a place to go to right you mean you don't want us to listen to you I didn't say that you go to where that that you can at least go to church cuz you need the Assembly of together of people of like Precious faith and do the best you can all right the prophet of God said what he said if you can't get a whole Loa get a high we go on vacations or anything all the vacations we've ever took we didn't miss services on Sunday we rode all over Colorado in a uh a city down there bigger than Commerce I guess and trying our best to find a church and we couldn't even find a Baptist I said find a Catholic Church I ain't never been to mash H we couldn't find one we went in McDonald's talking about the lord well that was different brother R said you out hunting on Sunday go ahead and Hunt if you're way to where you can't be at church but we had to drive 15 miles to get we had to drive 15 miles to get out of the woods and another 15 to get over to the city we went to to try to to find a church but see I just always been that way you know and I've always told everybody go ahead the only time I've ever missed her there was one time out there and I told him I said you go ahead and Hunt I'll just stay in your cabin and listen to tapes and have a good time and I had supper underway when they got back that evening because that was just that's me all right so you say you legalist I brother around said when it comes to Works in my car on Sunday I won't do it he said you can call it legalism whatever you going to do you know now Sox is in the ditch go get the car out of the ditch you know all right but let me get off of that see but now listen we come up to a place to talk about that what is The Headstone I mean what do you expecting when the prophet would be speaking of headstone head seal cou Stone uh capping Stones um all what what are you expecting Surly you're expecting something and and what are you expecting you know to transpire at that time so we were trying to go through scripturally to show that in the the the First Kings when Solomon got the temple ready and got every you know the tabernac already that the life thing was the Ark of the Covenant all right and we read from from uh the message that brother Ram gave us on dedication we ended up reading on that one dedic 1962 1111 the morning service R up telling you and he talks about how that there's two tables of stone another words The Ten Commandments right come into the temple he said The Headstone the capping Stone all right so the headstone is the word right the Cornerstone is the revealed word right you agree which is Jesus Christ so if the corner stone is the revealed word which is Jesus Christ then The Headstone is the revealed word about Jesus Christ that was not made known any other time and that's why I was covering it this morning like we was even the disciples the great Apostle Paul he never wrote about the seals or anything cuz that was withholding from him but Jesus preached it but see none of them ever brought it out why cuz it was waiting for the end time none of them talked about the son of man as I said don't get into Matthew Mark Luke and John that was under the law the writing of sure after they received the Holy Ghost but it was writing of the Life of Christ amen all right and and they could speak of those things because that's what Jesus spoke of right well then Here Comes brother Ram in the last days isn't it such a marvelous parallel to look at what Jesus would do and then look at what brother around would do here he would start talking about the son of man when the son of man is being revealed well see that was a great mystery to understand and to to bring forth cuz it it took that to do it all right now as I was saying this morning then we're The Headstone was rejected we gave those quotes to the morning's message anybody that misses it go back to it and and pick them up all right look on the computer right now and brother Joe's got him on there see but brother R said the last one we read I think was uh E64 Abraham's Covenant confirmed number nine on your notes 61-10 he's talking about the rejected Stone will come back the rejected Stone will come back all right now so I'm looking for the coming of The Headstone but what am I looking for oh but brother Dale one day the head Stone will come and there'll be such an anointing yeah but you got to get in the right stage that's right because the two tables of stone came into the Tabernacle in the days of Solomon and then the shik kind of Glory fell now I've got another scripture to read for you in at a while but it'll be the light of the message all right but it may be interesting okay but now listen we're not looking for the physical returning of the Lord Jesus Christ in a Corporal body we're looking for the physical return in to meet him in the a all right we meet the Lord Jesus in the a the body in the a he doesn't step foot on Earth until the millennial rain all right see in in a Corporal body so we're not looking for that kind of a coming or that kind of a stone and we're looking at it as I said like the two tables of stone going into the temple and then the shik glory fallowing The Headstone will Unite with the entire Body of Christ all right all that are going to to be there at that point will be United together and I said I believe individuals can already be kept off but as a group I do not believe it is completed yet I just honestly say that I you know you say Well when will it be I don't know it will be but when it is it's only going to be a short time right of the manifestation of the Sons and Daughters of God under that headstone because it was only a short time of Jes Jesus Under The Headstone he met The Headstone there were Mount of transfiguration he went straight to Calvary that was his adoption that was his hear ye him all right see then that bringing it down see those two tables of stone came in and then the sh Glory come all right so we ended up by talking about that that was The Headstone coming which would be the revealed word right all right now and that's what I'm looking for the revealed word you say well we got it yeah we got it lay here right we've had this Bible we had this Bible before brother Brown ever come right but that didn't mean we understood it we've heard the prophet's message over and over I remember one day I was talking in a certain place and and I said brother R said so so and this brother said I just heard where's that at I said so and so he said I just heard that message it's not on there I said well now wait just a minute so I just happened to have the book with me so I just got the book and I said you know read that he said well you're right it's there you know but see the him and everybody standing around what if i' been left and didn't have the book everybody around there and him too would have went off saying brother Dale's all messed up well it doesn't matter I'm been messed up all the life but it's according to where the word is right or not so I'm looking for the word to be revealed that's what I'm looking for but then when the word is finally revealed and the adoption takes place then the sh kind of Glory can fall that's right the the prophet is US quoting this morning said there'd be such a baptism of the Holy Ghost that would fill every fiber of your being and and we' go into Rapture I'm looking for that am but let's look for whatever is Promised next that's right amen and see what that is all right so we found out that the Ten Commandments is the word of God that was God in letter form I can take the Ten Commandments and go through it'd be hard for me to do right now but what about the first one let's see what is it First Command U behold the Lord thy God is one or something like that right the first commandment that's exactly the message of hour the Lord our God is one that's right that's not a book of rules that's right man made it a book of rules it's a revelation of God I remember about years ago I could even preach out of it and I could take marriage and divorce right out of say like seal number I mean the you know the the uh I can take it out of the seals and take it out of the Ten Commandments letay it parallel you know because I'm not anointed to do that right now I was that's a day gone by and thank God for Richard and brother Ray Gabriel and them that's doing all of that and putting all those sermons in there and eventually we will have ever sermon from 82 up that's been preached in this church you know or at least our services to be able to where you can get the the uh MP3s or whatever and listen to them all right I didn't ask them to do that they' done that on their volunteer their own basis cuz I'd mentioned a lot of times that I preached the series on this well then they'd go back and try to pull that series Brother Dean there when I mentioned years ago that I preached on Daniel 70 weeks he said where's it at well I never preached on it again it just that was that you know and uh he said where's it at he sat down and that day it was a little harder than it is now because he had to take it off 7even me real and put it on the cassettes but he made this available to people the Daniel 70 weeks that I had preached back there well thank God for these people that'll do things like that you know and leave me to word that I can you know run my mouth and preach the gospel but listen see I want to Anchor this into you if we don't get nothing else the word revealed is what I'm talking about now there's a promise then to restore all things right all right see so if there ever was any word revealed or Made Alive anywhere prior to where we're at we are supposed to have within our possession at least the ability to be able to have that and we do by The Prophet's message thank God for these people that have put the prophet's message into word form take form Etc and done those things because you you know we're the only ones that would would say in the days of the voice of the seventh angel well see you don't have all the writings of luk you don't have all the writings of westle and things like that but I mean we have 12 13400 different messages of a prophet in our day thank God for technology you know to where we can have it yes see and and all like that just just thank God for it it's a it's a help thank God for the computers where we can run it up without having to take the old days of searching for months over one quote let see we we we are supposed to be word people and then our headstone would have to be the revealed word but it'd be what was not made known you said well wait a minute now you said restore means to restore yes the Lord Jesus Christ preached right he preached six seals in Matthew 24 so that can be restored don't worry about it we get on over see he went through the change of the body right that can be restored right see all of these things are are there we're just moving along but look what we brought out from Christ The Mystery of God revealed just to make sure you follow what I'm talking about of the word the Bible the message look what the prophet had to say Christ mystery God revealed this is p page 7576 Christ of mystery and as the head was took up from the grave so must the body follow him into Eden therefore the body cannot recognize any other headship what but the headship of the word if we're word how can we recognize anything else no denomination can put anything to it for whosoever shall take one word away from it or add one word to it they took away from it they took away from it you're dead hybrid right there she's back here with the testimony in her hands the filter of her fornication committing spiritual fornication against the very word that she claims to believe see therefore it's the word or nothing that's right he the word how do you know it's right he the word is Vindicated see he the word properly Vindicated now watch it is the headship the head of the church he is the word the headship he's properly ident identified Vindicated by his own spirit being in the church itself the person showing forth himself in Vindication is the direct proof to the entire body you don't need Creeds then denominations as perish but the headship itself recognize in the body by personal identification see identifying himself proves the headship to the body then we are united under one Vindicated headship that is Christ the word of God not under any church then our headship is a kingdom amen all right the kingdom of God is within you said the Bible Jesus the kingdom we are not a denomination we belong to a kingdom and the kingdom is the word of God made spirit and life in our own life bringing to pass watch Ever promise in this day as it did in that day when the word in God was one now how much pler could you get and the word in God is one in his church today watch making it the headship of the body watch that is redeemed to bring the message in the Life day and be taken up from the dead in the resurrection to go back to restore again Eden just again Adam and Eve in the beginning of the Garden of Eden the three-fold mystery of God his body oh my next one is kinds of Believers 63 11:24 he's talking about the assassination of the president and see the other things and cold blooded murder and house coming down and he's saying it like this you said and the son of man Ascend it up so shall his body Ascend up and he is the head his church is the body oh God it's the head that guides the body and let the headship of the word guide the body of Christ that I that may I be part of that body Lord now what is our headship the revealed word what is the headship You're Expecting brother Dale the revealed word I believe this message is the revealed word am all right but I believe it's got to be revealed to me and you it was revealed to the prophet that's right but then people are saved brother around and said it and I got it well right you could have said that just as easy that the Bible says it and I got it right you can make the same claims to the Bible see but that don't work does it no see but see what are you expecting brother Dale I'm expecting the word of God to be preached by the fivefold ministry right that the prophet has brought unto us and by that that will bring us to that place like I was quoting this morning that this messenger of Malachi 4 would do two things one turn the hearts of the children back to the faith of the fathers two reveal the seven Thunders which is a revelation contained in the seven seal it'll be these divinely reveal mystery to that literally turn our hearts back all right so brother brand brought the message and off The Scene 40 something years later now we are following that Channel Through the word to come out to the end time to see where that we're at and to know what's going on all right see then the word see as I said this morning brother Brandon please explain to us what took place in the temple that we can see what to expect here and then we went to dedication to where brother R said it was those two tables of stone coming into the temple the Ark of the Covenant found its resting place everything was in order but now keep that in mind everything had to be in order told you I got another scripture but I wait till the to read it everything had to be perfectly in order there couldn't be one guy over here playing a trumpet and playing you know Nearer My God to thee you know and all the rest of them playing Amazing Grace what he in the spirit he was playing in the spirit I don't care he wasn't in the he wasn't in the right of the conductor he wasn't listening to the conductor right all right so then what is it what are we looking for God to reveal and to do that we must make oursel available right and people who refuse to listen to the seals and things to anybody that can preach about it they won't listen to that well that's up to them that's none of my business all right now let's get down to one thing then cuz we got up to this point to where we were reading about you know after the door of the Gentile church is closed he'll anoint a church then because that would be then the anointing that would strike home to the church see and when it does see it would be in the end time and be in the revealed word now I'm trying to pick up where I left off to continue it see then the head Shield of the Bride of Jesus Christ is the revealed word and the one that reveals that word must be here it's not an outward teacher we don't have that right we have teachers in the body of Christ yeah we believe in that but we have the Holy Ghost as the teacher on the inside cuz that's the only way we can hear all right and it wasn't to Elijah of the Great Sound of the blast the great doing the this the Lightnings and the Thunder it was a still Small Voice that brought him out of the cave all right so now let's get into it and see what we can do let's see if we can let the prophet of God show us how this headstone will come and it being the revealed word all right let's just read now you you got your your notes from this morning uh some of you that wasn't here if you is there some extra C are you done pass them out I know brother couple of them back there all right but brother random said is this the sign of the end sir page 4862 12:30 the evening service and he's talking about the great constellation of angels that he had seen a vision of he was talking about he would have you know that there'd be a great uh something great coming forth to the church and then he said could it be that the mighty Thunder are the seventh angel in the seven constellation now this is before he met with the angels and this is before he was going west seven period constellation the pyramid made in a form three on the side and one on the top and the dro from eternity could it be is this the mystery of the seven Thunders that will bring back The Headstone all right that's number 13 on you could it be is this the mystery of the seven Thunders that we bring back The Headstone well brother Dale the seven Thunders nobody knows what the Thunders are all right I'm glad you said that so let's read what the prophet said they are that's why I love to do it that way all right number 14 on your notes page 139 of the first seal 63-18 and he's talking about how it can't be revealed until the end time now when the Thunder remember a loud clapping noise of a thunder is the voice of God Amen now he's telling you that's what the Bible said see a clap of Thunder they thought it was Thunder but it was God he understood it for it was revealed to him it was a thunder so what is a thunder it's a voice of God okay when did the thunder sound to the prophet when the seals were broke there was one Blast Of Thunder in the Bible and Seven Seals broke all right there was one Blast Of Thunder to the prophet in Tucson Arizona and Seven Seals broke but now I've been through it I can go back through it whatever you want to do brother brandom says that those angels never told him anything out there they told him to go back to Jeffersonville and it would be revealed all right now he said it would be revealed where there he said well that was just what it well that's what he said now so that's up to you and what he said he comes to the First on that c the god in Simplicity and even the breach he said I don't know what the first deal is well now he's a liar if he did I don't mind talking that way if he knew what it was and said he didn't know what it was it makes him a liar he said the Angels Came daily in the room see the Thunder the voice of God all right now then what are we doing then what are we looking for we're looking for the point of what I've always tried to get you to see there has to be the ministry of the Lord Lord Jesus in the faith of the fathers we covered that this morning we read where the Prophet said the same Ministry the apostles had that's called the faith of the fathers and that's what the Lord Jesus placed within the disciples are made known to him but he did not make known The Headstone cuz it was rejected all right but see that Ministry of the faith of the fathers has got to be here before then you can even speak of the Mysteries of the last days all right or the mystery of the headstone that's why people are don't understand it they're taking a and forgive me for using the word what else if we're a born again Christian we're a baby I'm not de christianizing nobody I'm just telling it like it is if we're a baby trying to figure out adult words we got a problem right right you know we got a problem because we're we're we're taking our little F out or how you say those words you know little bitty understanding to try to figure out the great Eternal God wait for God to reveal it that's the biggest thing brother R said that's what happened to Eve in the garden right he said she couldn't wait see that's her problem all right now so what are we to do now see we got to have the same Ministry that the Lord Jesus Christ gave the apostles that's mandatory it's not a question it's mandatory then we can start talking about the things of the end time see of the prophet's message right cuz see you'd be jumping you in other words if you you say well I brother I believe I'm born again but I just jumped up here know well how did you get up there brother Mo had a good point he said that's like taking and jumping up in the air and taking your your bootstraps you know the strings on your boots and you just pull yourself up now how many want to try that I can do one at a time but I can only get that so far but see that's what we're doing we try to jump up to something and we got it I said don't make it too easy that you can stumble into it but don't make it so hard till it cannot be comprehended or understood or or retained you know attained unto so now let's just read a few things brother brand had to say about this same Ministry now we're talking about now the ministry of Jesus Christ that he didn't tell the disciples we read the quotes about the ones where he the things that they understood now we're talking about what's going to bring the coming of The Headstone the finishing of all things and then the sh kind of Glory can fall so look at number 15 on your notes sign of the Messiah 1959 3 329e and he's talking about because it's a commission commission charged me by an Angel and confirmed by his word let it be known tonight that you're Jesus Christ so he's praying listen Son of God that raised from the dead and you live in your church in your people now watch it not just run around in your people to perform and carry out the same Ministry you had when you were here in the body of Flesh Grant it Lord will praise you in Jesus's Christ name amen the same Ministry Jesus had when he was here in the body of Flesh that's what I'm expecting what about you all right look at the next one same ministry that's what I'm trying to get you to see but I'm W you to see that he said in your people are among the people and then we're going to read a scripture to show the the tying together well let's do it right now let's do it because it's it's hanging there and if I don't you're going to miss it all right you just we just read of the the in sec in First Kings 8 let's read 2 Chronicles all right now remember the Kings and the Chronicles in other words the same thing is repeated right what's over here is repeated what was in the Kings is repeated in the Chronicles all right now now this is not two temples see watch what it's done now got to make sure you understand it's not two temples then we're going to go to 2 chonicles 51 okay now I want you to read and see what you got to do with it I just want to read verse one then we'll drop down cuz I want you to see it's Solomon and not two temples not Solomon building one and in a rest restoration of the temple the same thing happens in the restoration of the temple come on we can go all the way over there to the restoration of the temple under what Ezra and Nehemiah and when it does finish this kind of Glory comes into the temple again but this is a repeat of what happened in the Kings all right thus all the work that Solomon made for the house of the Lord was finished and you go reading all the way down through and it's the same thing that you're being the spreading of it and verse 10 says and there was nothing in the ark say the same as king now the two tables which Moses put here therein at Horeb when the Lord made a covenant with the children of Israel when they came out of Egypt and he came to pass when the priest were come out of the Holy place for all the priests that were present were Sanctified and did not then wait by course in other words they were set but they they were everybody was just doing it brother R said there was thousands of sacrifices being made it wasn't just one it was just being made everywhere there all right now watch verse 12 and also the Levites which were the singers which were the singers all of them of a sap every how you pronounce it of Hermon uh jotum you pronounce the words correct I don't know how with their sons and their Brethren being arrayed in white linen having symbols and poers and hearts to it the East End Of The Altar and with them at 120 priests sounding with trumpets now listen to all this is taking place okay and it came to pass as the trumpeters and the singers were as one are you listening yes perfect harmony to make one sound to be heard in praising and thanking the lord and when they lifted up their voice with the trumpets and symbols and instruments of music and praise the Lord saying for he is good for his mercy endureth forever that then the house of the Lord was filled with a cloud even the house the the house was filled with a cloud even the house of the Lord that the priest could not stand see the reason want to read that is that's not it's not mentioned in Kings that they were all in one Accord one thing in common there's where the bride's problem is amen right not being in harmony right we've all got our own little way this is what I believe oh my well and then we just isolate from everybody else oh my see we're not in one they said the singers the musicians how many trumpets were there 10 what 120 priests sounding with trumpets sacrifices being made everywhere all was taking place according to the word they were all singing and worshiping having a wonderful time oh wouldn't I like to see a church like that but you know what it's individuals in this church and we're everyone responsible right you say it's his fault or her fault well you automatically are saying it's your fault you need any more you're automatically saying it's your fault cuz you're looking around to find you're a little baby you're a little child that's looking around to see I don't see how she could worship God because she's not dressed right oh Lord she's not according to oh Lord you see why I Don't Preach when I get on that you know but if you can't read the word of God and see come on see in Kings it doesn't tell you that they were totally in in one Accord now when they got to the upper room is this Bible that when they got to The Upper Room brother randam said that they got so far along in there and some of them begin to say I think we got it let's just go out by faith we've seen the sick healed the dead raised we've seen the ministry let's go out by faith he said but one stood up in the midst and said the sh kind of Glory ain't fell yet right well it sounds like they were having a pretty good time under the sh kind of Glory here right they were shouting rejoicing you like 150 trumpets and everybody shouting Glory Hallelujah what was all that were saying he's good heard in in thanking the lord and they lifted up their voice with the trumpets and symbols and instruments of music and praise the Lord saying for he is good for his mercy endureth forever that then the house was filled so we want to sh kind of glory and Lulu let's get in one Accord amen one Accord now listen to me has never been what other people make it I do not believe that everybody around the world is going to come to a place to where every preacher will get up the pull pit around the world and they'll say Jesus and all around the world everybody say Jesus I've never believed it we're human we're mortal beings but look like we could when we come to the house of the Lord lay down our feelings yes our little petty feelings amen someone said didn't speak to me they looked at me like they something's wrong they don't want to S with me I wish we'd come in those doors back there in a prayerful attitude and stop judging one another right and running our mouth about one another he said well you don't sound like you want things straight I want see a church so filled of the Holy Ghost until there won't be no feelings of you and I have left it'll only be Jesus Christ that's the church I want to say and I know and realize that as human Mortals we will always have differences that's right that's what I've Illustrated brother R said some of them or one of them or something got up and said I think we got it but said one of them in the group said it said Joel hasn't been fulfilled we were to stay here until and when they got in one mind in one Accord and I don't like the joke where that they crossed the desert in one Accord of a Toyota either you know the joke the three come across the desert in one Accord they was riding in a Toyota no they wasn't there riding on camel's back amen I don't like jokes about the word of God that's right amen maybe you think they're funny but I don't they were in one mind and one Accord in the upper room and then the Holy Ghost fell they were in one mind in one Accord right here and this sh kind of Glory came The Headstone was already there in place right come on the word was in place and when the word got in place they started rejoicing David remember his wife made fun of him because he was shouting because they were bringing back the word he said if you think paraphrasing it said if you think have something you wait till tomorrow that's right you know you think that was something me shouting you wait tomorrow see what are we doing folks that's why there of Glory hadn't come that's why it hasn't been there why because babies are trying to understand spiritual matters and it won't be there got to be a Ministry of Jesus Christ all right we found there from page or paragraph that's paragraph 50 sign of the Messiah we read that one where in your people to perform all right listen standing in the Gap 1963 6 6:23 the morning service and he's talking about the pyramid and the the rock the things is coming is in the shape of a pyramid but the cap on the pyramid was never put on now I've been in Cairo and in Egypt and the cap never did come because it was a Cornerstone it was a headstone in the church it was the Cornerstone in the full church it was The Headstone right so it never did come it was rejected Christ and it will come and I believe that when it's coming that the church will shake into a place from justification under Luther ification under Wesley and the Pentecostal message will bring the church to such a minority and the ministry will be among those people till it'll be exactly the same Ministry that Jesus did and that'll bring Jesus and catch the whole thing away okay so let's just keep reading Abraham's Covenant confirmed e23 1961 318 he's talking about the Pentecostals and wesling Etc coming down and now it goes on till that has to get to such a perfect place until when that headstone finally comes it'll fit so perfectly the church will be have to be in such a such a perfect State until when Christ comes he fits right into it that's right now keep on reading if you want to in between but drop down to the last to the next paragraph he said it's home to a perfect condition till it fits perfectly without cement that's the word the church is going to have to be so hon down the word hor horning honing the church until when Christ comes to take the church the ministry the church will will pick right up on it and will raise Luther westle and Pentecost and all and go with it that's right to take the church up hear you himy 1959 424 the evening service you talking about when a child is adopted then there comes a day when that son becomes he's going to be adopted or placed you Brethren what I'm trying to say placing of a son you understand what I mean he's to be placed positionally he becomes there and they take him out in the streets and put put him on a certain garment and they have a ceremony and after that Ceremony this childish Place were adopted into the same family he was born in and his name is just as good on checkbook as his daddy's right he falls out positionally placed just to showing you headstone adoption checkbook all comes to one thing all right Watchman what of the night 6722 E40 he talking about the same thing in coming of the son of man the same Ministry that the son went down in the same light he went down in is coming again in the resurrection power and The Morning Star is reflecting that light then we cry Watchman what of the night Abraham's Covenant confirmed 1961 to10 E40 if you can catch it and know what I'm talking about number 20 on your notes the very Ministry that Jesus Christ was doing here on Earth when it comes back the very same Ministry at Pentecost listen will have to will not have to widen itself out in organization that will not have to but shape itself up in Christ until the headstone and the church will fit one to the other and them may see so cemented till you can't even run take a razor blade and go around and find a crack where they were put together and that's how the church has got to come so much like Christ and look what we've got to do then cut away and circumcise and chop off and form and molded into the image of Jesus Christ until that church in the cap comes right smack to together he goes down and talks about the negative and the positive becomes one people don't like that negative and positive ain't nothing negative in God well brother random used it and that's the way it is coming the church has got to shape itself in itself till it hasn't got a spot or wrinkle amen there's the second right it becometh us to fulfill all righteousness which is 1961 101 the morning service paragraph 192 he talking about the churches week the churches of the day we're broke up in an organizational St strip separation of Brotherhood Methodist Baptist Presbyterian Oneness freeness finess all kind of stuff we're broke up that's the way it's supposed supposed to be it's got to be that way now that's what he says so then we got Lula I and got this I and that I and whose I and whatever right all right but once then there will come a message oh Hallelujah and we know that that same Pillar of Fire that led Israel we know that the same Ministry that accompanied Jesus Christ by that Pillar of Fire that had him anointed is accompanying the church today science has proved it we don't need that God proved it we need the ministry of Jesus Christ to fit that headstone coming y That's brought the church into a place where the ministry is exactly like it was when Jesus left exactly Mighty God unveiled 1964 629 page 23 it's changed from the Pagan he's talking about from glory to glory changing coming across East to the West it's changed from Pagan down into Lutheran from Lutheran down into Wesley from Wesley into Pentecost and on and on changing from glory to glory producing the hidden Manner and now it's right to bring him back exactly like he was at the beginning his same Ministry the same Jesus the Same power the same Holy Ghost the same one that come down on the day of Pentecost is is the same Holy Ghost that's manifested today from Glory into glory to glory and back to its original seed with the baptism of the Holy Ghost with the same signs same wond same baptism same kind of people acting the same way with the same power the same sensation is from Glory under Glory the next will be CH be changed from Glory into a body like his own glorious body where we shall see him Abraham saw the same all right 22 turn over 23 I hope you take these home and read them paragraph 1 paragraph 1021 which would be question 117 questions and answer 64 823 evening I'm not he I am his servant and the pillar of fire is not he it's in spirit form see which was upon the son of man and has come now to anoint sons of men now what came on Jesus on the River Jordan the full anointing right he was born Lord the Christ the full anointing came on him on the River Jordan for his ministry so watch what he's covered right here which was a son of man that's come now to anoint sons of men to bring back a Ministry just like he said it would be in order for the head and the rest of the body to connect together just like like the pyramid as un built and we find in that we never did get get the headstone on it why The Headstone Yet to Come the seven steps in the pyramid and we'll go through that someday and I just like to show you how that really is perfectly with the scriptures all right spoken words Original Seed page 108 preached 1962 3:18 the evening service he was born to do that to destroy the works of the devil now his body is to do the same because the body is the head and body is together is that right if Christ is the head now what if Christ is the head what's the word his body has to be the same thing as his head was is that right a church of the word born of the word virgin born from the word not denominational now virgin born from the word keep on reading the way the body operates is by the head is that right my body can't move until my head tells it to move well what if my head head is flesh and my body is concrete can't move head can say move move move move but there's not nothing there's nothing to send a message to is that right well if my head is Christ and my body is a denomination how's it going to work how can purify and a work together Purity and a work together oh I love it brother I'll tell you I'd like to preach on some of this a while the way the body operates Ates is by the head and the head is the word is that right the head is the word now watch what he goes on to say man here they can turn on the light 1963 12:29 the morning service paragraph 162 you talking about Pentecostal mana and all well yesterday's Luther's manner would not work for Methodist Methodist manner would not work for Pentecost Pentecostal manner will not work for today see what I mean every day has come day by day fresh and so has it to the church ages Luther's manner was the message of justification Wesley's man message was the manifestation of sanctification Pentecostal was the restoration of gifts but this is introducing The Headstone the last days the bride tree cont to all of it it it's the same life but it's just Mater it's more advanced he says all right taken from the church a book number 26 on your notes 380 which is the church a goodness called the resume of the ages these H said Luther had the spirit of God but his age was not the age of full restoration by another outpouring like in the beginning it was it was the same with Wesley see it wouldn't that Booth KN withfield Berard Jonathan Edwards M or so forth surely they were full of the Holy Ghost yes they certainly were but the age in which each live was not the age of restoration neither was any age but this last age the age of complete blackout in apos apostasy this is the age of apostasy this is the age of restoration it is the age of the finished cycle with this it is all over amen sign of is coming 62407 not all them Pentecostal world is but I mean in that group they're in there somewhere I don't know where they're at but they're in there somewhere because there'll never be another church age then this is the last one but God will take that elect out of that Pentecostal group and shape it in that coming Stone just like that would have to fit like that to bring that roof down to it you watch it won't be Cy cornered and setting this away it'll be perfectly fit and this church will have to have the same Ministry and Jesus testified of the same thing we would see Jesus 62712 and as the church like the pyramid comes to a point so has the church in the days of Luther days of Wesley days of Pentecost and now just before the headstone comes into it that church has to be hone so perfectly till the same Ministry that he did here his spirit so predominant will bring that same body right into it and resurrect the whole thing exactly that's exactly amen glory to God last one turn on the lights 1964 1225 that pyramid is so perfect if any of you has been there you can't run a razor blade hardly they the they had no mortar in it as far as we know the architect of it was so great now they lost The Headstone and they don't know where it's at but when The Headstone returns it'll be just like the rest of it it will blend with the in with the stone that's left open if you should put the headstone on it it' have to be that way and when Jesus returns he will find a church that's washed without spot or wrinkle it'll be the same Ministry he had it'll bring back The Headstone so it's left up to you and I it's left up to you and I I know that was fight reading but you can take them home and reread them you will not stoping to express on each one because you can take them home and read them and see what he's saying the whole point is what just like back there when all all the musicians all of the trumpeters all the priests and everybody got in place all right the two tables of stone had done come in The Headstone had done reached his place then the shic of Glory struck home what is The Headstone brother Dale I believe it is those Seven Seals that was brought by the prophet right all right right I do not believe now you can believe what you want to because I've got it wrote in my notes to say this over again later people have argued Brother Richard lost a family because he said that brother brandham was adopted in' 63 when he met the Angels out there the brother said well you don't know that's where it was at but watch the point I believe he was adopted don't you where it was in the cabin at 2 years old you know or the day he was born or whether it was in Arizona in' 63 he was adopted right you see quit a church because as you're saying and I believe this is where he was adopted you know what word is your adoption well that's what I'm say Brother D when I received a new birth I was adopted into the body of Christ a baby three stages of adoption what about the faith of the fathers what do you mean we believe same thing the apostles did now the apostles never believed in Two Souls seven Thunder virtue peria son of man two Lords River Jordan none of them is in the Bible but yet the message people are split all over the world by those doctrines and everybody says that they are it and I've told you before there's where the deception is going to fall I preached the message the other day that the prophet of God said what he would do these things to try us if a prophet speaks and it comes goes to pass and he takes you to another God he said I done it to try you you see you think that it's going to go one of these days until now I hope I'm wrong but this is what I've always believed so okay this is my personal opinion now okay I don't believe you're ever going to convert those people individual out of those things would be right all right but not as a whole right and you know what's going to happen one day when that Shak kind of Glory Falls the two Soul people are going to be rejoicing around the world and saying we told you we was right the Shak kind of Glory has fallen the seventh Thunder virtue people are going the peruse the two Lords they're going to be shouting I said that 40 years ago I still believe it today I believe when that anointing strikes is just like it is now it's to try you to see what you'll do amen but somewhere right down through the middle of that the little bride of Jesus Christ will be walking in the word there was 120 sitting in the upper room out of a world of Millions and they were the only one that had the truth then we come down to the last days anointed ones the spirit poured out upon All Flesh and God's doing it to Tres to see if we'll just stay with the word to see what we'll do letting things go wrong to see what we'll do call cing these great signs and wonders remember the other week to take place to try you to see whether you'll stay with the word see what would happen to 90% of the people if you took two dead people and said left them in a congregation and one of those doctrinal issues people got up and said I'll prove you that I'm right but two was going to raise the dead what would you do well I guess better go along them cuz we can't do nothing ourselves Bible says to take them out and kill them you see that's a stern look on your face I'm set quoting the Bible if my son prophesies a lie I'm supposed to kill it right that's Bible but yet we don't live in that day right we don't do those things we call them brothers and they can prophesy all kind of things and predictions and things and we call them brothers somebody's going to stay with the word what are you going to do brother Dale I'm going to keep right on going if I come here and preach to the post I'll be preaching to the Post because I'm just going to stay with what I've been staying with all this time it's led me all this way it's kept me from falling into any of these doctr I pray to God to just get you cuz that's my desire brother colie we were over in South Carina one time coming back and we were talking about one day that there'd be a lot of this and that and the other happened I said brother collie my desires one thing that I've planted enough word into you if the day comes when you can't get to Lula that word will hold you that's the only desire I have popularity is who cares right what is it money what's it worth brother said Keep Your Homes belong to the world counsil of churches or take the mark of the beast that's what he said one of the quotes is exact but you know but what are we going to do well don't you think we're to go listen to what brother so and so says go listen to it go listen but what does the word say yeah but it sounds so good remember what we started reading our headship is the word you know they told brother Brandon Billy Paul even told him when he told that lady she' die at like 3:00 Billy Paul said I was in that meeting daddy and he said in it was the Holy Ghost and brother brandom didn't say it wasn't get to quote and see Billy Paul said it was the Holy Ghost he said Billy I'm all I'm going to tell you is one thing God didn't tell me no different right you know what she died 3:00 you know that didn't convert a one of them that was shouting Glory Hallelujah and their tongues and interpretations and all the things that they were saying come on did it convert any of them no think got him something else you remember the lady that was fixing her holes and everything and she got ready to jump up because she done done it till three nights and she jumped up to say something and brother randam said sit down and shut up you know what the preacher said he the service was over they said brother random you grieve the Holy Spirit he said how he said she had something fresh from God you was just bringing the old word he said anything contrary to word not right amen what about it what are you going to do cuz I've told you what I believe because when that sh Falls it's going to fall on everything the Methodist the Baptist and everybody's going to be shot and Glory Hallelujah but you know you say well well brother d you just preached it that that's what will happen in in the temple but you didn't listen The Headstone which was the word went in the temple and took its place that's why I read the two different accounts which is telling you one just telling you what it is when they went in the temple the Ark of the Covenant reached his Place Chronicles tells you they were rejoicing and having a great time the word had already reached his place I believe the word is just about reached his place amen I said just about it I don't have no argument then the anointing can strike but what's it going to strike remember the rain falls on the just and the unjust what about it what about the word people might not understand our terminologies but we're just simply talking about salvation right being born again amen by the uncorrupt uncorruptible word of God always been the word with me amen cuz that's just all I can stand on I can't stand on what anybody else tells you tell me something I said well okay I believe you it it hurts my heart for me to say something and you say I don't believe you cuz you could at least say when I brother Dale believes that cuz see if you tell me something unless I got a reason you know I'm going to believe what you say yeah that's just the way I've always been you say well that's your problem believe anything I'll believe it until it's proved wrong then when it's proved wrong you're the one that's got egg on your face not me that's somebody tell you brother Dale's guil is so and so and I appreciate this one brother he called me he said brother Dale these two men was talking about you and said they said you said so and so and he said I told him said I know brother Dale and he didn't say it like that I said thank you brother I mean to me that was he he knew what I believed and he knew what I stood for he said he didn't say that well he might have misunderstood no no didn't say that well are you perfect in Christ I am thank you amen you are too if you're in Christ that's right never will be humanly perfect that's right never won't to I strive for it but it won't never work CU as quick as I get rid of one thing I get another one is that what you get I pray through on one thing and I get it out of the way and I said Lord thank you I get one day cuz two days later he going to be right back and I'm in a battle again take on these things let's go into the communion and just think on these things Terrence and Bob if you will let's stand together go into the communion they were in one mind in one Accord and they come to communion time they had reached a place they had reached the place that they were supposed to be and when they did then they had the communion you know for I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus was the same night in which he was betrayed took bread and when he had given thanks he break it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this do in remembrance of me after the same manner also he took the cup when he had s saying this cup is the New Testament in my blood this do ye as often as you drink it in remembrance of me for as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup you do sh the Lord's death till he come wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord so let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh Damnation to himself not Discerning the Lord's body for this cause many are weak and sickly among you and many sleep for if we would judge ourselves we should not be judged and I love this scripture but when we are judged we are chasen to the Lord that we should not be condemned with the world wherefore my brethren when you come together to eat carry one for another and if any man hunger let him eat at home that you come not together into condemnation and the rest will I set in order when I come think on these things think on these things condemnation what's your problem then why wouldn't we

talking about you know lusting after women or anything you know do it and he said first you goling then you walking and then you're caught talking so that's a good way to put it first you gawking then you start walking along behind getting telephone numbers and thing the first thing you know you're talking and you done done a lot of wrong so let's just get it all out anybody else before we I'd like to pray for my friend in the hospital he's still in the hospital all right remember brother do his friend in the hospital just pray the Lord touching amen anybody else we brother last Su I come we prayed for had burn in my throat I down my stomach and everything so after then haven't had that problem am amen Bo we believe he anybody just taking a little time I want you to pray for John he was in the hospital had his leg operated on had a steel fo steel plate fo in CU he fell from the remember this one for for Duty and his friends and all anybody else before if not then the Bible says they had just a few moments of solid prayer praying one for the other the Lord May bless us and keep us and you know you pray for me I pray for you thank you for all things Lord in Jesus name Bible said he took bread and blessed it father we thank you for this bread it's been made for this purpose today and in the making of the bread is prepared for the hour and as we break this bread may we remember you and your word your body that was shed for each one of us sanctify the bread and the partakers that we may all be together as one in you in Jesus name you know one day when we get over there we'll do this we'll remember a lot of things remember the days and the hours that we lived and the time CU I don't believe we'll ever get to the place we won't remember you know what took place here on Earth in our life and our journey because why would we come to it if we wouldn't going to remember some of it but it'll all be happy then on it father we thank you for this wine it's went through the stages is now getting better each day it represents the the Holy Spirit and as we take this little piece of bre bread to represent Thy word our daily bread that we receive then we drank the little bit of wine we pray that you'll stimulate that and it'll make blood cells in our body we pray that you would just stimulate your word and let your word Lord fill each one of our hearts and lives by revealed word in Jesus name amen amen come morning I walk by the river I'll the Ever Green Tree I'll carry my cross through the midnight Come Morning [Music] Glory sometimes I despised and rejected and I question oh Father how then I take one more at Mount Calvary and it gives me the strength to go on come morning I walk by the [Music] river I rest me the ever tree I'll carry my cross through the midnight morning there's glory for you know it's such a wonderful time to think about all the things that you and I have been able to see that what God has revealed to us and we can see the word that he's made known in our hearts and lives and just think about it where would we be be if it wasn't that word that's been revealed may be a hard thing but yet where would we be what would be the the point life without God would be a meaningless thing right amen right what do we think about it what a wonderful opportunity that has been given to you and I to be able to take God's word and to hear it blessed are your eyes for they see and your ears for they hear if I die and go to hell I can still be happy because I can say I've seen I can say that I've seen God's word what about you [Music] in [Music] let's all protect together you can be seated for a moment till we read our scriptures and get ready for for the foot washing but just think about it what an opportunity we have been given you know that mankind I remember when I was back there and I'm sure that you think you can remember when we we were in organized religions and things wondering about God up one day down the next you know one man preach something to us make us feel good and other man preach the next week make us feel bad and just up and down but then to be able to say that we can take the word and believe it just further Advanced as I read to you glory glory to glory further Advanced but how can it Advance much further than where we are I'm not we don't make dates and times and Seasons we're not concerned but you know there will be a day and a time I think I mentioned it may have even just here but you know the Bible says no man knows the day or the hour that's right well if you took 365 people and gave each one of them a day you you understand what I mean 365 people stand them up and you got day one day two day three day four then next month next month next month next month and you know each one of them say was my day my day my day well you know you know you still wouldn't be able to deny that scripture that says no man knows the day or the hour you know why cuz you got that one quter of a day right cuz it's actually 365 in the fourth days right which means you've got 365 and then every four years or what it turns you got that one day that falls in there cuz see you still couldn't do it so the scripture is still right no man knows the day nor the hour there's no way because he doesn't make that to mankind he does it in his own let's stand together and read our scripture then we'll go into the foot washing 13th chapter of John verse 2 and supper being ended the devil having now put into the heart of Judas his carrot Simon's son to betray him Jesus knowing that the father had given all things into his hands and that he was come from God and went to God he rises from supper and laid aside his garments and took a towel and GED himself after that he poured water into a basin and began to wash the disciples feet and to wipe them with the wherewith he was GED then cometh he to Simon Peter and Peter Sith unto him Lord Dost thou wash my feet Jesus answered and said unto him what I do thou knowest not now but Thou shalt know Hereafter Peter said unto him Thou shalt never wash my feet Jesus answered him if I wash thee not thou Hast no part with me Simon Peter said unto him Lord not my feet only but also my hands and my head Jesus said unto him he that is washed needeth not saved to wash his feet but his clean every with and you are clean but not all for he knew who should betray him therefore said he you are not all clean so after he had washed their feet and had taken his garments and was set down again he said unto them know you what I have done to you you call me master and Lord and you say well for so I am if I then your Lord and Master have washed your feet you also ought to wash one another's feet for I have given you an example that you should do as I have done to you verily verily I say unto you the servant is not greater than his Lord neither he that is sent greater than he that sent him if you know these things happy are ye if you do them let's just all bow our head and be dismissed father we pray now as we going into the foot wash and the sisters going downstairs to continue this Lord we ask that you would bless each one and give each one of us understanding and then when all is finished and done may you protect us on the highway and give everybody a safe journey we love you and we thank you in Jesus name amen you're dismissed
