[2:38] of the lord jesus christ amen amen
[2:41] praise the lord if you have your your
[2:43] bibles uh let's let's just turn to the
[2:46] book of psalms
[2:47] psalms chapter 112.
[2:51] yeah
[2:52] psalms chapter 112
[2:56] and
[2:58] we're just going to read the whole
[2:59] chapter and it's only 10 verses but i
[3:02] want to concentrate on verses 7 and 8.
[3:06] psalms 112 it says praise ye the lord
[3:10] blessed is the man that feareth the lord
[3:12] that delighteth greatly in his
[3:14] commandments
[3:15] his seed shall be
[3:17] mighty upon earth the generation of the
[3:20] upright shall be blessed
[3:22] wealth and riches shall be in his house
[3:25] in his righteousness endureth forever
[3:29] and his righteousness endureth forever
[3:31] unto the upright there ariseth light in
[3:33] the darkness he is gracious and full of
[3:36] compassion and righteous
[3:38] a good man showeth favor and lendeth he
[3:42] will guide his affairs with discretion
[3:45] surely he shall not be moved forever the
[3:48] righteous shall be in everlasting
[3:50] remembrance
[3:51] and now watch verse 7 it says he shall
[3:54] not be afraid of evil tidings
[3:57] his heart is fixed trusting in the lord
[4:01] and uh in the contemporary english
[4:03] version it says it this way
[4:05] i like the way it says bad news won't
[4:08] bother them
[4:09] they have decided to trust the lord amen
[4:13] his heart
[4:14] his heart is established
[4:17] he shall not be afraid until he see his
[4:20] desire upon his enemies he hath
[4:22] dispersed he hath given to the poor his
[4:25] righteousness and endureth forever
[4:28] his horn shall be exalted with honor
[4:31] the wicked shall see it and be grieved
[4:34] he shall gnash with his teeth and melt
[4:37] away the desire of the wicked shall
[4:40] perish praise the lord jesus
[4:42] amen so we want to we want to speak this
[4:44] morning amen on the a little title
[4:47] called when bad news strikes when bad
[4:49] news strikes and uh i was going to
[4:52] continue ministering on the uh
[4:55] what i was ministering on wednesday
[4:56] about advancing god's kingdom
[4:59] by fulfilling the law of christ but
[5:01] maybe next time when we next time we
[5:03] minister we will continue with that i
[5:05] just felt impressed to just go this
[5:07] route
[5:08] because certainly uh saints we've we've
[5:11] had a lot of bad news
[5:13] in the past several days
[5:15] but um
[5:17] you know and then looking in the word
[5:18] you know
[5:19] and you know all around us there's
[5:21] always bad news you know you look into
[5:24] you look in the news and and you know
[5:25] how are the how the news companies make
[5:27] money you know they got to proclaim bad
[5:29] news i mean nobody makes money they
[5:31] don't make money proclaiming good news
[5:34] uh every now and then you might see
[5:35] something good
[5:37] in in mainstream media but most of the
[5:40] time is bad news bad news uh came across
[5:43] a website a couple of years ago and it
[5:45] actually it was called a website called
[5:46] happynews.com
[5:49] and
[5:50] i think the site's still up but it
[5:52] hasn't been updated in a long time but
[5:54] uh it was everything anything that you
[5:56] could think of happy news it was it was
[5:58] right there so uh certainly a different
[6:00] alternative from from what we see at cnn
[6:03] fox news and all these but they they
[6:06] have that's how they make their living
[6:07] is through bad news but you know verse 7
[6:10] here tells us he shall not be afraid of
[6:13] evil news or evil tidings
[6:15] why because his heart is fixed trusting
[6:19] in the lord amen and that's how god
[6:21] wants us to do amen is to trust in him
[6:24] no matter what news comes along our way
[6:28] no matter what takes place or what's
[6:30] happening all around us and no matter
[6:32] how dark it gets we must stay steadfast
[6:35] on what god has placed in our hearts
[6:37] because that's that's the way that's the
[6:39] way jesus lived his life uh you know
[6:42] many times
[6:44] and we'll look at it in in a little bit
[6:46] later but you know him being in a boat
[6:49] uh uh sleeping just just
[6:52] just not concerned he was tired but he
[6:55] was not concerned when the disciples
[6:56] were there waking him up you know lord
[7:00] don't you see that we're going to perish
[7:01] because there's a storm you know and the
[7:03] boat's about to sink water's coming in
[7:05] and jesus was sitting in the back amen
[7:07] on a pillow resting his head not even
[7:10] concerned of what was going on why
[7:12] because he was he knew where he was
[7:14] standing he knew where he was fixed he
[7:17] was god
[7:18] here on earth and and so that's how god
[7:21] wants us
[7:22] to do in this hour because if we had
[7:24] christ in us that same spirit that
[7:26] dwelled in him amen
[7:28] it's the same spirit amen that is in you
[7:30] praise god is is the same god amen that
[7:34] is in you in the form of the holy ghost
[7:36] and that is the exact same way that we
[7:38] should take amen when we hear bad
[7:40] tidings when we hear bad things happen
[7:41] all around us i know the human
[7:45] the human reaction is to be afraid the
[7:47] human reaction is to is to quickly react
[7:50] and the human reaction is to is to worry
[7:54] but god tells us amen here in his word
[7:56] he shall not be afraid of evil tidings
[7:59] his heart is fixed trusting in the lord
[8:01] praise god
[8:02] amen you know what satan what he tries
[8:05] to do is he many times he tries to
[8:07] divert our attention by bad news
[8:10] when we're
[8:11] we're we're happy we're rejoicing we're
[8:13] serving the lord nothing bad is
[8:14] happening in our lives i mean we have to
[8:16] work we get tired we uh we have to deal
[8:19] pay bills and different things then all
[8:21] of a sudden bad news strikes or
[8:23] something happens in our lives that
[8:25] completely changes things and and and
[8:28] and and that's when god wants to see
[8:31] where you're really standing
[8:32] now satan would try to use those those
[8:35] situations to divert our attention to
[8:38] divert
[8:39] our our faith in god to put it in in
[8:42] more in a doctor or in a medicine or in
[8:45] something else but god wants to see if
[8:48] okay he'll allow satan go ahead satan
[8:51] use whatever you need to do you are just
[8:53] a tool in my hands
[8:56] now let me see how my children are going
[8:57] to react now out of that situation
[9:00] you're either going to come out stronger
[9:02] or you're going to fail and god's going
[9:05] to have you do that lesson once again
[9:07] because each and every one of us uh god
[9:10] wants us to get to a certain point in
[9:12] our lives amen where we are mature
[9:14] christians and
[9:16] i believe the times that we are in now
[9:19] god is calling for that
[9:20] it's it god is really calling for that
[9:23] and and that's why we need to
[9:25] to really seek god more in prayer
[9:28] fasting do whatever it needs to happen
[9:31] because uh the time of playing games is
[9:33] over right the time of being nonchalant
[9:36] about serving god is over now it's time
[9:38] to really amen seek god and and and seek
[9:42] his will for our lives and we know his
[9:44] will is his word amen so we know that
[9:47] god's attributes they're manifested
[9:48] through negatives we know that that
[9:50] without if there was nobody to save uh
[9:54] he would not be a savior if there was
[9:56] nobody sick he would not be a healer we
[9:58] know all the attributes so it takes a
[10:00] positive it takes a negative
[10:02] and a positive amen to to have the full
[10:05] picture
[10:06] and you cannot have a full picture uh a
[10:09] color beautiful picture there was not a
[10:11] negative and there was not a positive
[10:13] there has to be both in order for there
[10:16] to to for the full picture and that's
[10:18] why sometimes we wonder lord why is this
[10:21] happening in my life what is this going
[10:22] on why why are you allowing this i mean
[10:25] that's the negative part but then the
[10:27] positive part is hey thanking god that
[10:30] you are uh
[10:31] for what you do have remember when we
[10:33] talked the other day about under
[10:35] pressure thanking him for what you we do
[10:37] have amen uh it could be worse
[10:41] it could be worse sometimes but but but
[10:44] then though it takes those two things
[10:46] that positive in that negative to bring
[10:48] out the full picture and eventually god
[10:49] will reveal that to us i used to i used
[10:52] to uh work in um
[10:55] not work but when i was in school i used
[10:57] to do photography and we would go to the
[10:59] dark room
[11:00] and it was all red and dark in there and
[11:02] we'd have all the chemicals when we were
[11:04] developing film
[11:06] and uh
[11:07] for those who remember what film is
[11:09] and
[11:11] we used to go in there and would put the
[11:13] film after taking pictures put the film
[11:16] in the different in the different uh uh
[11:19] liquids now you see that film had to go
[11:21] through all those processes
[11:24] right all those different processes and
[11:26] all being drowned
[11:28] amongst all those different little
[11:30] liquids
[11:31] amen in the midst of darkness in the
[11:33] midst of of of of it's red and dark amen
[11:37] but see i knew what i was doing
[11:40] god was in control god is in control i
[11:43] knew what liquid to put to put this film
[11:46] in
[11:46] first and then take it to this to this
[11:49] put it in this liquid and then do this
[11:51] and then make it dry out and eventually
[11:54] the negative comes out and then we can
[11:56] take out positive images out of that
[11:58] amen see god has a process and he's in
[12:01] he's in full control
[12:03] praise the lord so uh just quick
[12:05] examples in the word about uh uh
[12:09] when when bad news hits you know
[12:11] remember let's remember the story of
[12:13] esther
[12:15] esther heard bad news
[12:17] about
[12:18] a decree that had gone out haman was
[12:20] against the jews
[12:22] and uh
[12:23] uh mordecai uh which was her uncle
[12:27] uh he heard about the bad news and
[12:29] esther didn't have any idea her being
[12:31] the queen
[12:32] didn't even know
[12:34] and um
[12:36] and that's how we that's how we are
[12:38] sometimes you know in living in this
[12:40] life you know we we don't know
[12:42] everything we don't know why god is
[12:44] allowing what's happening amen
[12:47] i know one thing for sure i could just
[12:49] say that for me myself it's got me to
[12:52] pray more
[12:53] it's got me to seek god more
[12:55] it's got me to to to change my my the
[12:59] way i i view the the the brethren around
[13:01] me and and the people around me
[13:04] uh i i i i i i it's gotten to do that
[13:07] and i don't know about you but it's it's
[13:08] got me to do that so i thank god for
[13:10] that i thank god for for for because it
[13:14] it's those negative times that makes us
[13:17] look at ourselves
[13:18] esther didn't know what was going on
[13:20] mordecai
[13:21] got the message sent to her and it was
[13:23] bad news to her it was it was it wasn't
[13:26] certainly glad tidings it was bad
[13:28] tidings that her that her people were
[13:31] going to be destroyed haman made out the
[13:33] decree and it was stamped by the king
[13:35] and in the her her jewish the people
[13:39] were going to be destroyed and they were
[13:40] going to be killed and mordecai
[13:43] uh uh
[13:44] asked her all she could do the way she
[13:46] reacted is the only thing we can do is
[13:49] pray and fast
[13:51] and that's what she did and she called
[13:53] for a prayer and fast and told mordecai
[13:56] let all the people know that this is
[13:58] what we're gonna do for three days
[14:01] three days
[14:02] and she got up maybe she may not have
[14:05] heard anything
[14:06] audio audible from god but she got up
[14:09] with a confidence saying and she said
[14:11] listen if i perish i perish when i go
[14:13] before the king amen and
[14:16] and if we perish in in this hour but at
[14:19] least we did what we knew we were
[14:21] supposed to do we were responsible with
[14:23] the word that we had amen and that's all
[14:26] that god wants us to do to do is is is
[14:29] thou good and faithful servant amen what
[14:31] did you do with what i gave you amen and
[14:34] esther just went in there and before the
[14:36] king and not knowing if she was gonna
[14:39] die or if she was gonna live but she
[14:40] took that chance
[14:43] with the word and with what she had done
[14:45] backing her up amen
[14:47] and we know the rest of the story that
[14:50] that that the king accepted her amen
[14:52] he's put out his his scepter and she was
[14:55] able to come in she found she found
[14:57] grace before his eyes and uh the the
[15:01] jewish people they were able to to uh uh
[15:04] defend themselves before this
[15:06] proclamation that haman and you know who
[15:08] ended up losing it was haman
[15:12] haman which represents satan he was the
[15:14] loser the whole time the whole time he
[15:17] was thinking he was winning the whole
[15:18] time he was thinking he was he was all
[15:20] this whole thing is being activated it
[15:22] and i'm coming i'm rising up i'm rising
[15:25] up amen he's the one who ended up losing
[15:27] at the end esther became a man she
[15:29] became a hero amen she became not just
[15:32] only a hero but she's a representative
[15:34] of who the bride of christ is in this
[15:36] hour amen and the jewish people became
[15:40] out of that came a day that the the day
[15:42] of purim where they celebrate even to
[15:44] this day
[15:46] amen so i want us to look also in second
[15:48] chronicles chapter 20 if you have your
[15:51] bibles in second chronicles chapter 20.
[15:53] there was a another incident where uh
[15:56] king jehoshaphat who was one of the
[15:59] kings that the bible says that he did
[16:02] good in the eyes of the lord and he was
[16:04] a wise king and king jehoshaphat was
[16:07] about to be invaded by by moab
[16:11] and if you read the story there is very
[16:13] interesting because in second chronicles
[16:14] chapter 20 i'll just read verses three
[16:17] and four here it says in jehoshaphat
[16:19] uh fear now this is after he had heard
[16:23] see he was the king
[16:25] of judah at the time
[16:26] and
[16:27] he gets these news that moab was about
[16:30] to to invade them
[16:32] he and moab with the help of another uh
[16:35] uh they had another partner there was
[16:37] ammon i believe it was and they were
[16:39] getting ready to invade judah israel at
[16:41] the time
[16:42] and and
[16:44] jehoshaphat knew that they could not
[16:47] withstand the armies that were coming at
[16:49] me and this was bad news
[16:51] this was bad news i mean you as a
[16:53] commander you as a a king what would you
[16:55] do if you hear uh if if you heard uh
[16:59] let's just say the little little country
[17:01] of of guam amen and the leader there in
[17:04] guam or or whoever's uh and they hear
[17:07] all russia's coming to invade
[17:10] what
[17:11] what are you gonna what are you gonna do
[17:13] that was kind of similar what was
[17:14] happening here
[17:16] and so king jehoshaphat in verse 3 he
[17:18] says and jehoshaphat feared now see that
[17:20] was the natural thing for a human being
[17:23] to do
[17:24] but watch and he says and it's and set
[17:26] himself
[17:28] even though he feared it says and set
[17:29] himself to seek the lord
[17:33] and proclaimed a fast throughout all
[17:36] judah
[17:37] it's the same thing that esther did
[17:40] in verse 4 it says and judah gathered
[17:42] themselves together to ask help of the
[17:46] lord i mean who else could we turn to
[17:49] when bad news comes when all darkness is
[17:51] all around us amen the only one that we
[17:53] can turn to is the lord
[17:55] i mean we can't we can't turn to anybody
[17:58] else amen he is the only one but that's
[18:00] where god wants us in posse that's where
[18:02] he wants to see us
[18:04] amen you know you don't think that that
[18:06] god didn't know that ammon was getting
[18:07] ready to invade judah god knew it all
[18:09] along he knew while they were planning
[18:11] it
[18:12] yet god wanted to see what jehoshaphat
[18:15] was going to do and so in verse 4 and
[18:17] judah gathered themselves together to
[18:19] ask help of the lord even out of all the
[18:22] cities of judah they came to seek the
[18:24] lord my goodness
[18:26] wow
[18:27] out of all the cities of judah amen they
[18:29] got desperate
[18:31] god loves it when his children get
[18:32] desperate god loves desperation because
[18:35] out of desperation he does lots of great
[18:38] things
[18:39] amen because he wants to get the glory
[18:41] he wants you to see what he can do amen
[18:44] when you are completely
[18:47] back back back backed up into a wall
[18:50] amen
[18:51] and so in in uh in
[18:54] in reading here in verse 5 i want you to
[18:56] hear what jehoshaphat's prayer was
[18:59] amen because
[19:00] sometimes in reading the prayers that
[19:02] are they are made in in situations like
[19:04] these and then we learn things i mean
[19:06] sometimes even listening to brother
[19:08] branham's prayers we get some good
[19:10] nuggets out of those prayers and so
[19:12] jehoshaphat's prayer was recorded there
[19:14] in ii chronicles chapter 20 and verse 5
[19:17] and it says in jehoshaphat stood in the
[19:19] congregation of judah so he he
[19:22] he may this was public
[19:24] and he wasn't in secretly i mean this is
[19:26] what he did before the people stood in
[19:29] the congregation of judah and jerusalem
[19:31] in the house of the lord before the new
[19:33] court
[19:34] and said oh lord god of our fathers art
[19:36] not thou god in heaven
[19:38] and rule us not thou over all the
[19:40] kingdoms of the heathen and then thy
[19:43] hand is there not power in might so that
[19:46] none is able to withstand thee
[19:49] and that's what we we say in this hour
[19:51] amen but we know that he he's powerful
[19:54] art not thou our god who did us drive
[19:56] out the inhabitants of this land before
[19:59] thy people israel and gave us it to the
[20:01] seed of abraham thy friend forever isn't
[20:04] he the same god that that healed
[20:06] yesterday isn't he the same god that's
[20:09] even raised the dead even amongst us
[20:10] amen isn't he the same god that's done
[20:13] mighty things around us we know that he
[20:15] is praise god and we are his seed
[20:19] we are the seed of abraham praise the
[20:21] lord wear his seed by faith praise god
[20:24] and why are these things happening to us
[20:27] that's exactly what what jehoshaphat was
[20:30] asking as well
[20:33] in verse 7 it says are not thou our god
[20:35] who did us drive out the inhabitants of
[20:36] this land before thy people israel gave
[20:38] us it to the seed of abraham thy for thy
[20:41] friend forever
[20:42] and they dwelt therein and have built
[20:44] thee sanctuary therein for thy name
[20:46] saying if when evil cometh upon us as
[20:49] the sword judgment or pestilence or
[20:52] famine we stand before this house and
[20:54] then thy presence for thy name is in
[20:56] this house
[20:57] amen thy name is in this house
[21:00] so why is this happening
[21:02] amen he's put his name in
[21:05] on in you
[21:06] amen we live by his name we're a people
[21:09] called by his name praise god
[21:11] and cry unto thee in our affliction then
[21:14] thou will hear and help in their case it
[21:16] was it was the house it was it was the
[21:18] temple amen it was it was the tabernacle
[21:20] amen where he had put his name in praise
[21:23] god
[21:24] and when you would look to that amen
[21:27] there would be help that's what jonas
[21:28] did while he was in the belly of the
[21:30] well he said if i look toward thy temple
[21:32] i know that i shall be saved praise god
[21:35] and now behold the children of ammon and
[21:37] moab and mount sayre whom thou wouldest
[21:40] not let israel invade
[21:43] when they came out of the land of egypt
[21:45] but they turned from them and destroyed
[21:47] them not so here
[21:49] uh
[21:50] jehoshaphat is saying lord you allowed
[21:53] us to not even come against these people
[21:56] when we left egypt because uh the
[21:59] children of israel i mean they were they
[22:00] were slaying dragons left and right and
[22:02] slaying people therefore god was with
[22:04] them
[22:05] but these were people that they did not
[22:07] touch at all these were a people that
[22:10] that god allowed them to continue
[22:12] forward and they did not even bother
[22:14] them at all they did not have any any uh
[22:16] beef with them if you could say it that
[22:18] way
[22:19] though if you call it in in in current
[22:22] in our days terms
[22:24] but this is what jehoshaphat is saying
[22:25] now those people are coming against them
[22:28] and so
[22:30] when they came out of the land of egypt
[22:31] but they turned from them and destroyed
[22:33] them not behold i say how they reward us
[22:36] look how look what they're doing to us
[22:38] now to come to cast us out of thy
[22:40] possession which thou has given us to
[22:43] inherit in other words they're come to
[22:45] to
[22:46] take us out and
[22:48] and exalt us from our from the land that
[22:50] you gave us lord
[22:52] and so in verse 12 and it says oh our
[22:55] god will thou not judge them for we have
[22:58] no might against this great company we
[23:00] we there's nothing we can do against
[23:02] this p this great company these great
[23:04] people that cometh against us neither
[23:07] know we what to do
[23:10] but our eyes are upon thee
[23:13] amen praise god now what did psalms 112
[23:16] we just read said our eyes are fixed on
[23:18] thee lord we stay stand fast amen but
[23:21] our eyes are upon thee our eyes are not
[23:23] upon anything else amen our eyes are not
[23:26] upon the bad news that we're hearing but
[23:28] our eyes are upon the good news amen our
[23:31] eyes are upon what you said lord on the
[23:33] promises that you made we don't know
[23:35] what to do we don't know what's going on
[23:38] we can't explain every detail of what's
[23:39] happening but god you know what's
[23:41] happening lord you know what what what
[23:43] to do and in verse 13 and all judah
[23:46] stood before the lord listen all judah
[23:49] all israel oh my goodness all israel
[23:52] stood before the lord with their little
[23:54] ones
[23:55] their wives and their children
[23:58] and it wasn't just jehoshaphat it wasn't
[24:00] just just the priests it wasn't just the
[24:03] prophets it was the little ones the
[24:05] children everybody stood before the lord
[24:08] when bad news came amen when they heard
[24:10] these bad news that they were about to
[24:12] get invaded i wonder if we do that in
[24:14] this hour amen
[24:16] do we stay with our do we stand with our
[24:18] families amen do we do we get do do we
[24:21] get desperate before god or is it just
[24:23] you amen but is it all of our families
[24:26] amen when we all do that amen especially
[24:28] us as a congregation do that amen you'll
[24:31] you're going to see god do great things
[24:33] amongst us
[24:35] amen
[24:36] and so if you continue reading the story
[24:38] i don't have time to read it but if you
[24:40] continue reading that story god gives
[24:43] word after they prayed after they did
[24:44] what they were supposed to do god gives
[24:46] word to the prophet uh
[24:48] not to the prophet but to the levite
[24:50] jihazio
[24:52] and tells them that they were going to
[24:54] be victorious
[24:56] as a matter of fact
[24:57] they were not even going to fight at all
[25:00] they were going to they were it gives
[25:02] them the word that that that the enemies
[25:04] amen and all of them were going to
[25:06] actually destroy themselves
[25:09] they were going to destroy themselves
[25:11] and it wasn't you know normally the word
[25:13] of the lord comes to the prophet right
[25:15] this was a levite that received that
[25:17] word
[25:19] it wasn't it wasn't a it was just a
[25:22] common he was i believe he was a priest
[25:24] because the levites were priests it was
[25:26] just a priest that the word of the lord
[25:27] came to and this is this is uh uh
[25:31] what the the people of israel or the
[25:33] people of judah they took that and they
[25:36] went on they went with it and god and
[25:38] god destroyed their enemies and king
[25:40] jehoshaphat and judah prevailed
[25:43] amen but what did they have to do
[25:45] they prayed they fasted they got
[25:47] together and they said
[25:49] lord
[25:50] you've given us these promises you've
[25:52] given us this land you've given us this
[25:54] temple this place lord why would you do
[25:57] all of this father
[25:59] if you're not going to protect us
[26:02] if you're no you see we can't do
[26:03] anything god if you don't step in lord
[26:06] there's nothing we can do
[26:08] if god doesn't step in in this hour of
[26:10] saints
[26:11] amen there is nothing we can do
[26:14] amen
[26:15] god is the one that has to prevail god
[26:17] is the one that has to do the work amen
[26:20] and god wants it that way because god
[26:21] wants us to see amen the miracles that
[26:25] the the things that he can do and we've
[26:27] all seen them we've all seen great
[26:28] things that god has done in our lives
[26:30] amen but he wants us to see it again
[26:33] and again and again and again praise god
[26:36] amen what a wonderful story and we could
[26:38] go in in more details with that amen
[26:41] there's another another story similar to
[26:44] this if you read in isaiah chapter 37
[26:46] where the the where king hezekiah he
[26:49] received bad news
[26:51] amen from king
[26:53] the king sennacherib
[26:55] of assyria
[26:56] and king sanakarib
[26:58] he was out destroying all the all the
[27:01] peoples around him and and and slain and
[27:04] taking over
[27:05] and now it was time for him to take over
[27:08] uh israel
[27:10] judah
[27:11] the same jihad the same judah that king
[27:14] uh jehoshaphat was over now king
[27:16] hezekiah was over the same land and here
[27:19] comes bad news from from from king
[27:22] sennacherib and in in this time it was
[27:25] by a letter that was sent to king
[27:27] hezekiah you can read there in isaiah
[27:29] chapter 37 he receives this letter
[27:33] and and i don't know if you all received
[27:35] bad news in in letter form or an email
[27:38] amen we're gonna have to close your your
[27:40] bank account or or or or or you know
[27:43] your life insurance policy is uh you
[27:45] know we're gone broke when we're gonna
[27:46] have to do or whatever it is whatever it
[27:48] may be you know bad news comes this was
[27:51] in the form of a letter this time
[27:53] king king uh jehoshaphat heard it by
[27:57] word of mouth now this time is by letter
[28:00] and it says if you read in king in
[28:02] isaiah chapter 37 and in verse 14 it
[28:05] says and hezekiah received the letter
[28:07] from the hand of the messengers
[28:09] and read it
[28:11] he read it
[28:12] but watch and hezekiah went up unto the
[28:15] house of the lord
[28:16] and spread it before the lord
[28:21] he spread the problem before the lord
[28:23] amen he went up to the house of the lord
[28:26] you see these are people that did not
[28:28] even have the holy ghost and that's the
[28:30] reaction that they take
[28:32] how about us with the holy ghost amen
[28:34] what should we do when problems and and
[28:37] things come to our lives amen we should
[28:40] go that's that's the first thing we
[28:41] should think about
[28:42] amen praise god and this that's what
[28:45] hezekiah does he spreads this letter
[28:47] before the lord and he says and and he
[28:50] starts praying and watch in verse 15 and
[28:52] hezekiah prayed unto the lord saying oh
[28:55] lord of hosts
[28:56] god of israel that dwelleth between the
[28:58] cherubims thou art the god even thou
[29:00] alone of all the kingdoms of the earth
[29:03] thou has made heaven and earth inclined
[29:06] on ear o lord and hear open thine eyes o
[29:09] lord and see and hear all the words of
[29:11] of
[29:12] sanakrib which have sent to reproach the
[29:15] living god
[29:16] he knew that it wasn't just a reproach
[29:19] towards the people but he was
[29:20] reproaching the living god by him by him
[29:23] uh saying this of a truth lord the kings
[29:27] of assyria have laid waste all the
[29:30] nations and their countries
[29:32] he knew that that's what was happening
[29:34] and have cast their gods into the fire
[29:37] for they were no gods but the work of
[29:39] man's hands wood and stone therefore
[29:42] they have destroyed them
[29:44] now therefore o lord our god save us
[29:47] from his hand that all the kingdoms of
[29:50] the earth may know that thou art the
[29:52] lord even thou only
[29:54] amen
[29:55] it wasn't a selfish prayer by by
[29:57] hezekiah just like jehoshaphat amen it
[30:00] was a prayer so that you lord can get
[30:02] the glory out of it amen we don't want
[30:04] these individuals a man to get healed
[30:06] amen just for the sake of getting healed
[30:08] amen but your lord so that you can get
[30:10] the glory out of it amen we don't want
[30:12] all these things that are happening all
[30:14] around us amen problems and situations
[30:17] lord you take care of these yes lord but
[30:19] so that ultimately you get the glory out
[30:21] of it
[30:22] because that's all we care about
[30:24] is that you get the glory lord
[30:27] amen
[30:28] and so if you continue reading amen
[30:30] god uh
[30:32] saves them from king from king from that
[30:34] king amen
[30:36] and gives them the victory and and and
[30:38] and protects them
[30:40] from from the king as a matter of fact
[30:42] uh uh they're destroyed and i believe if
[30:45] i understand correctly the two sons of
[30:48] that king senator killed his their own
[30:50] father
[30:52] and
[30:53] amen the same sword that they were going
[30:55] to kill with amen comes against them
[30:58] amen
[30:59] david says a lot in psalms he says the
[31:03] same devices that they have come up with
[31:05] lord that they fall in those same
[31:07] devices the same trap that satan puts
[31:11] amen to try to to hurt his children
[31:13] god's children amen let that same trap
[31:16] come upon him amen let that same trap
[31:18] come upon our enemies praise god
[31:21] but god knows what he's doing
[31:23] god allows the situation you don't think
[31:25] you don't think that god didn't know
[31:27] that that letter was going to be sent to
[31:28] king hezekiah
[31:30] god knew it before the foundation of the
[31:32] world
[31:34] he just wanted to see the reaction amen
[31:36] he wanted to put them in another
[31:38] position where they got desperate before
[31:40] god
[31:42] and you know what saints i i don't
[31:44] believe that this will be the first or
[31:45] last time that we will have bad news
[31:48] again
[31:49] it will continue
[31:50] bad news will always be around us and be
[31:52] here with us but it's like i said last
[31:55] time what are you going to do when it
[31:57] comes pressure when pressure comes what
[32:00] will you do amen it's what we do with
[32:02] pressure
[32:03] that uh
[32:04] either helps us advance or not advance
[32:07] amen
[32:08] you can read that there the rest of the
[32:10] story there in isaiah chapter 37.
[32:13] praise god
[32:16] you know and we were we were looking
[32:18] there at jesus amen where he was on the
[32:21] boat amen when he heard the bad news
[32:23] from the disciples that they were you
[32:24] know they were about to die due to this
[32:26] storm
[32:27] amen but jesus was just sleeping he
[32:30] didn't he did
[32:31] can you imagine that i mean just
[32:34] just right i mean as a matter of fact
[32:35] the waves moving and tossing to and fro
[32:38] was just rocking him to sleep even
[32:40] better and that's how that that's
[32:43] that is what troubles should do for the
[32:45] for the uh for the children
[32:48] for the children of god amen
[32:50] amen just rock us even more towards
[32:52] confidence towards him amen because why
[32:55] what does psalm 112 say again verse 7 he
[32:59] shall not be afraid of evil tidings
[33:02] his heart is fixed trusting in the lord
[33:05] amen and when jesus came amen he came to
[33:07] practice he came to live the word and
[33:10] that's why he was practicing amen he is
[33:12] the word praise god what happened you
[33:15] know that god amen he heard bad news
[33:17] himself
[33:19] even at the beginning when adam and eve
[33:21] sinned
[33:23] amen he heard bad news that his children
[33:27] had sinned
[33:28] and they've got no away from the word
[33:31] that he had commanded now did it take
[33:33] god by surprise
[33:35] no it did not
[33:37] he knew it all along as a matter of fact
[33:39] he knew it so much that he had already
[33:41] made a way for them even before the
[33:43] foundation of the world the lamb was
[33:45] slain in his mind before the foundation
[33:48] of the world amen he had made a way for
[33:51] them but he didn't take him by surprise
[33:53] and that's that that same god is the
[33:56] same god that we should have in us that
[33:58] when we hear the bad news amen
[34:01] doesn't take us by surprise because we
[34:03] know that he knows what is going on even
[34:06] though we don't know
[34:08] he knows and he has made a way out for
[34:11] us praise god he has already made a way
[34:13] of escape listen
[34:15] there's people that have that have
[34:17] passed away amongst us you know our
[34:19] precious brother don fear and you know
[34:21] he passed away amongst us he's a
[34:23] missionary uh
[34:25] and uh
[34:26] there to the philippines and different
[34:28] different countries of the world uh
[34:30] he he
[34:32] god took him amen this past week amen
[34:35] and apparently he died with covet and
[34:39] that god didn't that didn't take god by
[34:41] surprise that was just the avenue that
[34:43] god used amen to take our brother home
[34:46] amen that was just the avenue that he
[34:49] used
[34:50] and so god already has a way of escape
[34:53] amen
[34:54] for each and every one that could be the
[34:57] way of escape that god had for him
[34:59] that could be the way of escape amen
[35:01] sometimes even if god doesn't answer our
[35:04] prayer for the healing of the body amen
[35:08] and i was telling uh
[35:10] my wife this week in regards to brother
[35:13] royal you know brother roy you all just
[35:14] continue to pray for him in the
[35:15] philippines you know he's still he's
[35:18] still uh we're still believing that god
[35:20] is is touching his body and and
[35:24] and he's healing his body i mean he's
[35:25] still with us
[35:27] uh but uh just little by little he's got
[35:29] infection in his blood
[35:31] and uh it's gonna take some antibiotic
[35:34] treatment to to get rid of that but
[35:38] but i said you know i wonder if if it's
[35:42] god sometimes does things where
[35:44] he may prolong the healing of somebody
[35:47] not necessarily for that person
[35:49] because god can heal the body
[35:52] the body to be healed is not us
[35:56] is not difficult for him he is our
[35:58] healer he is the source of healing
[36:02] what if god is doing it for the ones
[36:04] around him
[36:05] for the hearts
[36:07] what he wants is the hearts
[36:10] and that's what's difficult
[36:12] it's more difficult not that it's
[36:14] difficult for him don't misunderstand me
[36:16] but it's what's it's tougher for him to
[36:18] deal with the hearts of the people
[36:20] because he cannot override their free
[36:24] moral
[36:24] agency you see he cannot override that
[36:28] he respects that he gave us that and so
[36:31] he's got he's got our brother may he's
[36:33] still laying in bed he's still sedated
[36:35] he's still having the problems but here
[36:38] his
[36:39] maybe family members maybe the friends
[36:42] people around him and god is trying to
[36:44] do something where maybe he's trying to
[36:46] touch the hearts
[36:47] amen
[36:49] and that's what he's more concerned
[36:50] about
[36:51] maybe he wants a more of a desperation
[36:54] for us to get together just like a king
[36:57] jehoshaphat and all the families and
[37:00] everybody got together in prayer amen
[37:03] god is more concerned about the heart
[37:04] than he is about the body amen amen he
[37:07] can heal the body no problem at all
[37:10] what god wants is the hearts
[37:12] amen because that's that's that's what
[37:14] he he cares for more amen
[37:17] and so sometimes if we look at
[37:18] situations that way there seem to be
[37:20] prolonged amen
[37:23] maybe god what he's waiting for is that
[37:25] we get our hearts right
[37:28] and then god will take care of the rest
[37:29] after that
[37:31] praise the lord amen
[37:33] so
[37:36] that is just how god wants us to react
[37:38] amen to bad news i mean he already has
[37:40] the solution
[37:42] he already has the solution all he wants
[37:44] us to do is maybe just get in action
[37:47] pray
[37:49] meditate
[37:50] pray get desperate before god amen
[37:53] amen just look real quick here at uh at
[37:57] things to do when bad news comes amen
[38:00] amen if we read in psalms chapter 28

[41:44] faith amen i don't know if you all have
[41:47] heard the story of of of horatio
[41:49] spafford
[41:50] horatio spafford was the man who wrote
[41:52] the song it is well with my soul
[41:55] and he uh
[41:57] the the what he went through
[42:00] for us to have that hymn
[42:02] is is incredible amen
[42:05] and uh he was a he was a uh he he was a
[42:08] uh
[42:09] um
[42:11] a lawyer
[42:12] amen and
[42:14] he was a successful attorney and a real
[42:16] estate investor
[42:17] and he had lost all his fortune in the
[42:19] great fire in a great chicago fire of
[42:22] 1871.
[42:24] in that same year or that around that
[42:27] same time
[42:28] his four-year-old son died of scarlet
[42:30] fever
[42:32] so he lost everything he had his his his
[42:34] well you know and then he lost his son
[42:37] and then and then if you read the story
[42:40] he he sent his family he wanted to send
[42:42] them to england overseas because he
[42:45] thought maybe they they wouldn't they
[42:46] could use a good vacation after after
[42:50] having gone through all that he he went
[42:52] through he had four four daughters
[42:54] and his wife and they he sent them off
[42:56] because he had to stay back in chicago
[42:58] to finish up a few things he sent them
[43:00] off
[43:01] and in the middle of them going
[43:04] their ship uh
[43:06] hit another ship
[43:08] and and they sunk all i believe it was
[43:10] 200 200 people that were on board two or
[43:12] three hundred people that were on board
[43:14] including his four daughters they all
[43:16] died
[43:18] and so his wife gets to gets to england
[43:21] and she sends a message to him gets a
[43:23] message to him and tells him everybody
[43:26] all of our our daughters are gone they
[43:29] they they they sunk you know they they
[43:31] drowned and and she she said what shall
[43:34] we do
[43:36] she asked him in that and that what
[43:38] shall we do and so what horatio does is
[43:42] he immediately he set sail for england
[43:44] they and uh and as he was as the ship
[43:48] that he was on was going through the
[43:50] same area where his daughter's ship was
[43:53] as he was going through the same area
[43:56] the captain knew about horatio and what
[43:59] had happened to his daughters so he
[44:01] points out the spot
[44:03] where they had where the ship had sunk
[44:05] and his daughters
[44:06] and he looked at the spot and it just
[44:08] inspiration came upon him
[44:10] and he penned those words
[44:12] amen when peace like a river
[44:15] attendeth my way
[44:17] when sorrows like sea billows rule
[44:20] whatever my lot thou has taught me to
[44:23] know
[44:24] it is well it is well with my soul
[44:28] amen
[44:29] but if it hadn't taken
[44:31] that tragedy
[44:33] that horatio went through at losing his
[44:35] family losing everything he had his
[44:38] four-year-old son with scarlet fever
[44:40] amen we would not have that that that
[44:42] that well beloved hymn that we have
[44:44] today
[44:45] that has blessed many many probably many
[44:48] have come to the lord because of that
[44:50] hymn
[44:51] and it's blessed me and i'm sure that it
[44:53] has blessed you
[44:55] praise god
[44:57] amen
[44:58] and so we're not always going to be
[45:00] uh
[45:02] we're not always going to be
[45:03] exempt from tragedies we're not always
[45:05] going to be exempt from hard times
[45:08] and as i've said before i believe that
[45:11] god will allow more hard times more
[45:13] difficult times
[45:14] to come in our lives we're not exempt
[45:16] from them but
[45:19] are we going to
[45:20] come out stronger during those hard
[45:22] times are we going to or is something
[45:24] good god is trying to squeeze something
[45:26] good out of us
[45:28] amen through those hard times through
[45:30] those squeezes amen
[45:32] faith in a loving god will will with
[45:34] trust in his divine help
[45:36] and we can confidently say amen that is
