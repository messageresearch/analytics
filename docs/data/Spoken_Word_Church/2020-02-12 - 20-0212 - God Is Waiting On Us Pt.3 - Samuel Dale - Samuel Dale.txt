========================================
open the eyes of my heart I want to see I want to see you [Music] open the eyes of my heart Lord open the eyes of my own and I want to see I want to see you to see you hi [Music] [Applause] shining in the light of your glory pour out your power in love as we sing holy holy overly high lifted shining in the light of your glory pour out your power in love as we sing holy holy holy oh holy olio holy holy holy I want to see you [Music] amen and amen one day we'll realize and look around and see each other and see that's where God lives so we'll understand what I mean good to see everybody in the house of the Lord if you'd like turning your Bible turn to Genesis 2 and then we'll go to Hebrews 11 Genesis 2 Hebrews 11 member the Valentine banquet starting Saturday making sure try to get everybody to get lined up to where they can 4 o'clock we'll get started and then we'll eat later you know as we go along so you've heard the announcements and all this rest the Lord would give us good weather and good times you know he always has before and we just think it we think everybody for working cleaning about the bottom of the basement out of water again it got back in it was in the other day and well Charlotte's had done vacuumed it up and everything we got here in time enough then to help her clean up today there was just too much for her but we appreciate her her doing her job and trying to help and all that was happened and not only with up running getting everything yet going because that's the way it is we want to make sure we get everything right ok any other announcements other than this banquet okay let's read your scriptures in from Genesis 2 now this is going to be a very odd message I warn you up front it's gonna be very very odd you know because I've had two weeks or free to just ponder what I'm talking about I said of the day she said you just haven't been studying like you been I said well what I do I just go in and sit down and read my notes I said get up and go back out the next day I go in sit down read my notes you know add a few words and next day I do the same thing so I'm studying it it'll run around alright Genesis 2 will start reversed for these are the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created in the day that the Lord God made the earth and the heavens now I wanna say something to you if you look at the scriptures and get them lined up right it's perfect but a lot of times that don't look perfect now man was created on what day six-day get if you read right above all right looks like he's created on the Sabbath and God blessed the seventh day and sanctified it unless there's works from the things but it's not see so don't get that in your mind say well it says seventh right third huh because that's what it says here these are the generations now he's explaining the whole makeup of creation he's not going day 1 day 2 day 3 day 4 see if you look at it that way it makes the Bible a whole lot more enjoyable all right in every plant of the field before it was in the earth and never herb of the field before a group for the Lord God had not caused it to rain upon the earth and there was not a man to till the ground but that went out of mist from the earth and watered the whole face of the ground and the Lord God formed man out of the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life and he became a living soul you may be seated we'll get to Hebrews 11 in a little bit well go ahead I'll just read it for you know what it is God having provided some better thing for us that they without us should not be made perfect all right now as I said it's going to be a very odd way and that's my ways I attempted to preach on there some I mean the layout some year two ago when it didn't seem to seem to line up you know so you wait until you find out and everything and you find out well you know like sister Frieda said it needed to wait for her so okay that's all right but see when you we take something and you read it and you're looking for God to speak to you about the word and how perfect it is and if you will he'll speak to you he'll show you like I said it looks exactly like they're in the creation because it doesn't say man was created on the sixth day it looks like he was created on the seventh day see you say well I can prove it by the Bible no because when you get over to there then we read it and said and there was no man to tell us all you're already into the creation of all the things so don't get discouraged when you things don't match up the way you think okay best thing to do is just set it aside if that don't set up real good just set it aside and just pray and every once in a while go get that and read it you know and read it and you'll see then one day it'll all just come into view and God will perfectly line it up all right now here's my point I've been asking you the question for quite a while it's like I said months ago but mainly in the series asking you the question of what does it mean when it says there that they without us should not be made perfect we go in and spend our time trying to decide whether the creation was this or the creation was that order there you know or we go into the want to try to figure out how we got to here whatever and figured out all all this well and done but the question is still why does it say it now you got to admit that it means what it says and says what it means and without a profit then to give us the definition look where we would be okay now but to say they without us cannot be made perfect now here's the key if you'll listen okay everybody why would now what we've got to deal with to get an understanding and a lineup and I don't care I'll finish it Sunday and the next Sunday weights gonna be gone I'll have to then I ain't concerned about it but listen in Bible terminologies now if you can ever find something that was in existence it can be replaced again or whatever you want to call it renewed whatever you want to call the terminologies work all right now then why would it say they without us it seems to put a great emphasis upon the people and we know according to the Prophet that really the emphasis is placed upon the end time all right now I've been reading those things and saying them and it's dependent upon me and you and there's a reason for that it's very valuable and terminologies of the Bible and it's laid out so perfectly until it's sealed away from the eyes of the wise and prudent but reveal the babes such as we'll learn and if they you know but do you realize this whole thing came into being because God had a plan and a purpose is that the best way to state it and get started right on Christ revealed and I was not into flavors anyhow God had a plan and a purpose that he was going to achieve alright now this is one statement I like of myself I'll make it because you'll probably maybe find it in bread around somewhere but I'm making this as myself so this is a quote from brother Dale that if I can find something in the Bible I can depend upon that you know and I don't look at it like it was back there or over there or later I look at it as the present tense because remember I've always tried to preach it that away I always tried to preach the fact I was trying to get you to see present tense right now I am means ever-present for eternity right so then now here's the statement whatever the way that God started he cannot change from that way now the Prophet said there could be greater revelation to added or more to think what you said you can't add to the word but he said as time goes along things could develop a little you know but it won't add to the word so if you can ever find in the word what your point is then you can see hey maybe that's the way God wants it well I I just quoted it the Prophet said that God had a plan and a purpose that he was going to achieve alright now what we do cannot stop that plan and purpose a pretty good in road or an attack happened in the garden right when Adam and Eve but it didn't change God's plan you never looked down and said wait a minute now they they done that so I've got to change my way he knew that that was the way they were going to do it and he knew exactly what he was going to do that he wasn't gonna have to prop it up and and and do anything that he was going to just let them live out their lives and then he would just step on the scene because remember now as we cover with the Prophet and been at it many many years of what God doesn't a creation has no beginning I mean a new creation has no beginning and no ending so you'd have to start anything back in eternal life right or back before the foundation of the world so that'd be the best way of saying back in eternity so god back in eternity had a plan and a purpose and he was going to see that achieve now we thank Adam and he throwed him a great big block or a great stumbling block to create two problems I wish I'd have brought it earlier when I was looking at it to other day we wrote around him he's talking about you and I and he said don't you worry about it he said God knew exactly what was gonna do something to that degree see he knew exactly what we were going to do so why didn't he run in and you know kill them the day of Olin eye all of the things and he'd wind up with Adam right that would be worried wound up you see in me he'd wind up without him him and Adam was still been in the garden but he didn't deliberately make Adam and Eve do wrong he made them perfect now you tell me he didn't then we might as well just yet and go home because I'm not gonna talk to you in that line he made everything perfect he might not have made it eternal in the beginning but he made it perfect all right and God always has used examples all the Old Testament an example of the New Testament all right then brother branham said on the missions of serpent seed he's talking about the creation and he said that pure pure P you are a beginning it's not about the making of mankind and making you know he said that pure beginning now listen do you believe that God got a wedge thrown at him or had problems doing that or do you believe he was just sitting back waiting on everything to take place we think he went on vacation you know we use that statement as a point that he's not around but I don't think so I think he was are so close until he'd be well what I'm saying now I'm trying to get something to you as a thought of why it says they without us cannot be made perfect Adam was created perfect do you agree because God can't create something imperfect the devil wasn't created imperfect he was anointed cherubim stood beside the Lord he could not be created something imperfect I can't do that I forgive me to have to take a coffee up or something because every time I turn around today he's trying his best to work me over and I just laugh and say my standing I want to go this life and we'll devil we'll just get through this they don't matter you know you come on do what you want to you say well that's a poor example of a Christian you're supposed to be positive I'm positive but what about you right I'm very positive because see what I'm looking at let me tell you in one nutshell let me just say this is what will answer the question Oh without us they cannot be made perfect so whatever he created had to create it perfect now that's the key to the whole thing he had to create it perfect he couldn't created it imperfect and then made it perfect but he can because he allows in his great mind and existence that as things goes along he can come to positions that he can take that which is not perfect and make it perfect he could do that that's alright but just remember he won't change his word if he wanted to be a healer how is he going to get something to heal if he wanted to be a savior how was he going to get something to say right so then he figures out his planning purpose and he starts it off perfect but you know it's kind of odd that the first creation of God was a man named Adam all right I was looking in our minute ago just trying to pick it up but somewhere brother run says like he's he said Adam was God's perfect son I found a couple of others but that's alright listen looking at Adam now what does the Bible call him it calls him the first Adam 2nd Corinthians or something in there I've got the notes ok Jesus Christ is the first Adam second uh come on stay with me though listen see because your Creator was before the world there's your real first Adam now I'm just kind of get you to play with me a little bit and think about something maybe give you something to ponder for days so then we see it as you said when you come on over all right Adam is the first Adam okay that's natural but why does it say that Adam was flesh and it says which came first that that was physical or that that was spiritual and Corinthians he said that that was physical came first then that which was spiritual came later because he God was going he couldn't put Adam in the garden as a total perfect being you're listening he couldn't put in there as a total perfect being God how would he have got to be a savior how would he got to be a healer you realize that the fall didn't them didn't pulling us no wrong God it just made God a way to fulfill his original plan now when you can look back and drive that anchor down and you extend our look at it that was the most marvelous creation in the world God's own son that was his first son Jesus was his first begotten that was his first son don't you think that he would put in and design or whatever it is that with all in mind that every son he had he wanted it like that be careful God put into Adam what he wanted he brought him exactly the way he wanted him he wanted him that away and he brought him that away and let me tell you for we even get started that's the way it's going to wind up if it don't wind up that way we're all going to get old and go to the nursing homes and blur out here and wait until death takes us well we've been at it for 50 years and they don't and that's what I'm telling you what I'm telling you and I don't back off I was preaching this here 40 years ago right here in this church trying to get to why do you think I don't go anywhere go see nobody wants to know what I'm talking about right they love me that's present but tell me if I hadn't preached in on these brothers in churches when they've ever won priest in this one I'm not throwing no songs I like it that way it's made me left alone it I don't have to argue with nobody I don't have to be put into no camp here's know you ain't wrong old enough but sister cleda and Larry and a few of them like that can remember when they'd say who do you follow long about - 68 69 70 what group are you in I just say I'm in the bride and I am kidding you I've been preaching that Jesus Christ was all-in-all Almighty God and that his laid out in the word his example for us to follow to come to the place to where he's at alright so there you see Adam created and God's original plan now I'll keep saying this cuz it's back to you it's not me I want you to know it's I'm putting it back to you do you believe that Adams plan was I mean God's plan was to bring Adam forth if you don't we need to just have a prayer line and pray for everybody no joke if you don't believe that God knew what he was going to do you need to go back to a good Baptist Church cuz they taught some of that and probably still do but what is it about Adam Adam is to be God's total original plan the everything that God wants he put it into Adam you said he wanted to fall come on how long do I got to preach on it for you to realize your profits when it said yes I did he said Satan didn't pull a thing over on God he helped him fulfill his plan right all right now so whatever you have in the original is the example right I mean you don't you don't start making a car and then you you get over the middle of it you know and I ain't making card I'm just talking you keep the original plan as long as it's selling then you might change over but what I'm getting at car had corn brakes right stirring wheel every one of them it may look entirely different but it's a car right see whatever you get put it down and spanker that now what I'm saying I'll keep saying that tonight anchor this point whatever God wanted Adam was ready but he got hindered what did that hinder God whoever did the garden you see what he's gonna do right so then think about it was Adam created eternal I know we've had a lot of problem trying to explain this long time ago and it's been there and I don't worry about it I've tried yet I'm gonna say it but I'm gonna back up Adam had eternal life in his soul will read that in a minute but his body and his spirit was not eternal now is that what God wants not stay that way but it evidently satisfies him for what he done because he took it and used it get my point to what we look for somewhere to begin this look at that point and see what that point really is and that point was a man that was a body a spirit and a soul but that wouldn't have been no good and just leave it like that so God would not have created it like that he didn't create Adam lost he didn't create a vlogs come on I've been through this way if you didn't agree with him he probably won't again but don't worry about it little random said Adam had eternal life so he said especially in to Adam and he said Eve was in Adam in theophany Hebrew series come on I'm on page 80 of the old book so what looks like what I'm getting that looks like when God started this see what it is said that Adam s that's who I want man I won't add him but I'm going to creating perfect he says I'm gonna give him eternal life I'm gonna put him in the garden and I'm gonna give him an eternal body and spirit and leave him in control in the body I mean in the garden oh yeah I've got to I've got to get even there so I'll just put even to Adam because I done made my six days creating right and he says I'll just give him a helpmeet but we know for certain that Adam was created body spirit and so as a natural human being that was God's plan and purpose you say how do you know it took place you wanna fuss I'll just keep saying it back to you it took place did you tell me what your problems are because you're not wanting to agree with the word being Ryan when God created Adam he didn't create him eternal because you can't create eternal so now what was Adam way to hold on here anyway 1:26 and 27 jump into 28 let us make man he made a special man Adams soul was eternal I'll read it to you in a minute okay but he didn't create him eternal he created him as a human being then he took the part that he had from the 1:26 and 27 man don't let us and put that man into Adams soul now he's got what he wants he's got a man that can help him fulfill his plans and purposes not to just go up past the garden and plow up stuff and replant no he's got a man that can help him now so he can't never take away that he turn alive and we know we don't anyway right okay that would be settled it he can't take it away so he knows once he gave or made that man that whatever he does from their own would be an example now remember your first beginning creation whatever you only use the terminologies is what you want that's your plan in purpose it was not to for God to create something that was you know that was eternal so what was Adam mail quoted Adam was God in another form called Adam now may I sing get down okay don't don't don't everybody wait okay what are you if you are a child of God you have eternal life in your soul is that eternal life a new creation the Bible calls at that but you know the correcting way of the problem brought it not to correct the Scriptures meaning but he brought it to the truth God began in Adam to impart eternal life not create know he had that plan before the world was listening to him last night and brother Aaron was saying said if you would never back down you never will be back there so okay no we said problems the way we get back are we have all kind of little sayings and things to try to get a start well we've been 50 years trying to get there I think it's time to sit down settle the thing and to see what it is Adams soul was not created eternal he was an impartation of Almighty God into human flesh what are you you're an impartation of eternal life because it doesn't mean it when it said new creations and all like that we get those terms in our minds and we keep running around yeah but the new creation had a beginning the one that I'm talking about had never had no beginning that's what I was talking about it during the Bible study or not about it about Michael see Michael was God in another form call the word that's where Satan could never figure that out Satan was the anointed cherub that stood beside the Lord if anything was going to be done God was going to turn to Satan and say Satan go to this well we need a world created and about that time then it gets to he's visually I've been around now this God for you know for a long time and and I kind of know his vibes and it's doing and what he's getting revved up he's getting involved up so what's he fixing to do about that time out steps a little pillar of fire al oh gosh I'm quoting brother Branham ok and said steps out and says let there be see don't misunderstand what becoming ologies I'm sorry the father never created anything now come on you know what I'm talking about we'll keep it we'll run it down into the right line but who was the creator the son he was before the foundation the world with the father who was he the son not another God not God in another form or whatever that's the best you can do cut less human terminologies that word that was back very the logos the theophany was Almighty God in the form to be used that he could create Satan looks at that and he says I don't understand this guy come where'd he come from right you ever thought like that the devil he starts getting mad he gets all upset where'd this guy come from I'm supposed to be doing the creating I'm supposed to be delivering the word right and we see we must have a pretty good point lined up anyway I like it but see Adam in his creation was body spirit and soul but then God put his life into Adam and made him a living soul eternal life in the soul of Adam we get there he stands his body in spirit Oh get it take you see that new birth that you have is God in another form inside of you call the alive word so God had a plan and a purpose to get itself revealed well what was he going to reveal itself as me you realize if he reveals himself as healer they got to be something sick so he's gonna have to get to happen if you reveal the seven assayer they got to be something lost so all of this happening didn't come forth as a it came forth to manifest itself in the right way now here's my kids listen why does it say they without us now we'll go it tonight I know we won't get through but that's our day without us cannot be made perfect it's not statement so they're depending on us oh no know what that means is they without us that means that the Trinity of God is sitting over here somewhere two or three people floating around time we get all them together we'll have the US is together no I like what Oh Theo Erasmus preached that time we took the name Jesus Jes us he said if it wasn't for us his name would be Jess alright so here we get the man now standing here Briard oh you mean that's what God wants it evidently is because that's what he got right now I've kept emphasizing that you don't stumble around he don't stumble around and find out well I fell I failed somewhere so I got to find some other way now I'll have to run over here and run no no no no he could stand out looking at him and say there's my child there's my part of thee so that I am drilling in a man named Adam we get he left him with a body and a spirit in the world of perfection let's get this right now so we don't play the game of jumping he was put into a world of perfection had he stayed that way everything been alright okay I understand that so don't just jump away but he he said you know that's my example child no no no no no now Jesus was the example job okay I'll go way back for the foundation world Jesus was that word no problem I'll go that way we just won't go that way what you say what I don't understand your brother Dale said you get started on the message and then you just dry up I thought the Prophet said questions made a strong Church oh but the Bible says questions gender strife right that's the Bible so now watch brother I'm talking about he's talking about the same thing that Peter everyone said it unanswered questions is what gender strife not answers on answer to run you know wrong questions it's what gingers just right because you can't put it together because your prophet says that it makes a strong Church why when the church gets the answers not when they get over this brother so until he's preaching that and I like him and I was but I can't understand brother Dale brought you're like oh brother so-and-so so when I get through the night I go home I put him in pop and I said don't listen to him that's your business I didn't start this church off of that and won't end anyway that's your business the only thing I ask you to do give me the opportunity that you give to others you know they say things wrong you know they say things that are wrong what do you do with there wrong he said well brother Dale I can't find you wrong okay that's off the plate what do you realize and I'll come back through every bit of this because I know it's gonna take it that God in His creation brought his plan and purpose into being and he started it with what he wanted it in today no no no no he wants us in eternity come on you got enough sense and followed me long enough to know don't stumble off on silly stuff listen God started with a man his name was Adam he had a body that was not eternal because there was no way the fall could have come if his body it had have been eternal he had a spirit that was not eternal there's no way for the fall to come had there been a spirit that had not fallen you mean that's what he won't he wants a man that'll believe that God and come to that place Jesus Christ came to that place right see Jesus's body wasn't eternal Jesus his spirit wasn't he Tom it was his soul that was eternal okay am i right at least not holler screamer do something if it's right it's right do you see when the fifth when the point of the creation came on through we'll follow it coming through Enoch that was not will follow those signs will come to Elijah that was take another will come through all of those to show you God can be working there but there's always a reason that they could not reach what he wanted him to reach Jesus Christ walked on earth as a man right soul eternal because he was an impartation of eternal life he was not a second son that was when God stepped in to his son or his soul the word the being hmm that's when you got one guard outside that's you don't have it you still tighter than you trinitarianism and in your life at least I don't understand what he means me said trinitarianism but you see what's the point Adam was God's original plan and the way he wanted all to come was first made manifest in Adam come on I mean we we stay only here for a while Adam was God an original plan to take care but Jesus was God's own son which is not a son but God in another form called a son right this is my beloved Son in whom I'm pleased to dwell so you see what I'm getting at now and you'll you'll catch it and we'll go for a little bit and stop see then whatever God started with he's gonna have to finish with that or else he'll change his mind somewhere along the way and if you believe that tell you I don't so that's all right I have no control over you my family left they've got to make their own decisions they've got to have their own Holy Ghost they got to be their own people a wife is saying see it was not an atom of creation now listen carefully of eternal life that was his body his spirit it was the impartation into him of the Genesis 1:26 and 27 men would have said let us make man there he stood and brother branham said Eve was in Adam so we want to beat Eve too yes about everything why didn't God while she was dr. doing all that thing why didn't he just get him something just go we'll take care of that and I'll get another one lay down Adam will we get another rib not making a joke it's true he had to do something no what happened he just turned his head we couldn't see I'll be back when it's time I'll be back it'll take me six thousand years to get back but I'll have many examples all the way through of this one example that I'm given but now here's the catch to the story Enoch walked off the earth true nobody in the Old Testament had an eternal soul you said well that it was no that's the one that was a beginning career all beginning all new beginning creation starts with a full-grown potential day of Pentecost when the Holy Ghost was fully come it had to have a certain amount of doing when anything like that it's got to have that to be be right and when it does then he stands and looks at his own child and you remember a child of God is not another God he's just God imparted I like the way brother molt used to try to explain he turned a lot he said you think you've got eternal life straight said this is where it sounds to me said you take this big ol Apple and said you whack it up and you give it out in pieces that's the way you've got your doctrine he said I just remember one thing when you run out of pieces you run out of God right once you give away them pieces it's all gone but God ain't that away more God gives out the greater he is the greater is the more he could pass out of himself but listen I'm gonna say this and then leave it that's why this age is here to finish up God's original plan and everything from Darr back was waiting on something to happen a bride a bride Adam had worn at fight over the Old Testament had won at failure I was listening to prophet two other day and you could take it straighten out all these thoughts and ideas people got and he said Adams bride didn't fall what are you saying boy it took a while the scepter and think oh he done told him he said because she wasn't in the original part of it so that's why she couldn't match nothing to put it back come on you'll find out when he days what serpent seed means okay Adam was God's original plan that he wanted to come forward he started that out with a man that was body spirit and soul the soul was eternal the body was in a time element he could be beaten he could beat all things his spirit was in a another world but yet he could be tempted in that spirit huh but that's so you couldn't touch it when a bride comes back on earth again that they can say I and my father are one let me quote the rest of it and these other things the Prophet said it'll all be over when you see that man that was back Gaara come all the way through and can bring him into being let him do his works and then bring him into being in this day you'll see God's plan let's see just think about it now let me finish up the message we I'll try to finish the part of God then walls when he gave you the new birth that was his plan but he wants our body and our spirit to come to that position I mean everybody ought to know that we'll follow that line what see the only way we can do that is to follow God in his ways and see what he's talking about where he's going what he's leading our soul is made eternal by the new birth but we are waiting the redemption of the body so now in reverse order when you can find it and you take this man and you bring him down through time and he bring him in to the New Testament and he's the second Adam he's got the original plan and what he's gonna do is wait till that can be made manifest it's already here you realize that a brown said the baptism of Holy Ghost you have is the same Holy Ghost that was on the shores of Galilee same Holy Ghost it created and all of these things when are we gonna realize that that he's in our soul yes but brother Taylor I can do that it if we didn't have any trouble now you're out of the Bible okay solve that don't come to me and say nothing like that cause you're out of the Bible see Satan in the garden he looked at Adam he said that guy created him it looks pretty good then all that was here steps into another and then to be and he said oh that's just bride his wife he done a good job that couldn't probably done much better than that himself cuz he yeah that's what he wanted he wanted that thing all right hand man I'm illustrating that period to get you to see it he don't want to be I have never met a boss of any where I worked that wanted to be in charge he wants the vice president to be in charge but him get all the Pat's on the back right but see then follow this life statement when this Mex are circling comes back to here you'll find that everybody in between there one way or the other was connected one way or other everybody was connected on the day of Pentecost what did you have you had the bride of Jesus Christ with eternal life in their soul their body and spirit was still in time you had the great Apostle Paul and he was looking around that day when he said it he said they without us could not be made perfect in other words he plainly saying to them hey do you realize I'm talking to you without something to happen without something to take place without the message that God has given me to bring to you you can never achieve what you're wanting they just glory hallelujah this happy in do you finally counted it easier than others I just leave you alone they without us in other words they that started if one form and the us that we are is one form called the body and they're not perfect until we receive but one said the Old Testament not perfect without the new but he said now the New Testament is not perfect without the old right all right because that's what it's got to be what do you follow me just think about this until we get back only see Paul was standing there it's gonna hurt I got on the notes I see what I'm gonna say it anyway Paul was standing there at a place because of his new birth and his adoption in these teachings in time that Adam had lost you agree with you don't what did he do see he goes about trying his best to get everybody to that place of his message they're trying their best to get out the message when you see Adams standing on the earth again in the right way and I've just preached it to you so there it is what is Adams standing on earth in the right way soul eternal body not eternal spirit not eternal so we've got to have the adoptions of the the different things and see I'm going to put it this way what about when Enoch walked off the earth well boy he just he just had so much of God hey man hey man I don't misunderstand me but he never had any Turner life in his soul he said oh yes he did now show me where it's at when Elijah flew off in the chariots was it the Holy Ghost in his soul that took him or the anointing that was on him and it was the anointing on Enoch see the answer lays within the word when we return back to the original faith and the father's not just playing and talking about it would actually be in that then God can come on the scene and do sometimes the upholstery I try that day and he said now your Old Testament people said without us you can't be made perfect but like brother dick says one day he turned around and he was to us and he was in the grave that's all right but he set a stage don't forget this Adams center stage in the garden of what God wants this day a people that'll do like Abraham and believe the word and doubt their doubts and get away from there flim flam's and ideas and opinions and things get down to the word the Prophet said to bright he was coming after a word born bride he said Christ ministry would have to be in the church before the rapture well I don't believe that okay you're doubting the Prophet sorry you're doubting the Prophet you could at least say what he said I just don't believe it I don't see it you believe to see or see to believe which was in come on musicians I've reached a place that I believe is what I need for you to think about Adam was God's example child God wants every one of his children to be like Adam now he wants to be like Jesus well don't get all exalted in her setup he wants them to be like what he's made herself in Adam he gave Adam eternal life why did Paul say Christ in you the hope of glory cuz that's what it is the eternal life is not just a game or playing eternal life is the Word of God revealed to us what about it let's stand together brother Branham in the message called a serpent seed he said the Bible said that Adam was the son of God that pure beginning batdari Adam was God's Son that perfect beginning pure being why didn't let me ask you a question while you're thinking why did God make Adam just whammo body spirit and soul eternal he said well with no way to God oh now you got it you got it you know that God was going to allow that to happen there was no way for it to come forth if he stayed in that perfect position complete position and see you've see God coming down through his next step is Enoch ain't just flies off but he's waiting on us okay the next one he's Elijah he's waiting on us well why is he waiting on us to become that man right there right here well I just don't see that can never be doing you're a doubter forgive me you're a doubter well I don't see it done I just don't feel it why don't you start practicing a little bit you know I'd rather have a little wildfire than no fire at all is it wrong to clap your hands and say and worship God but I don't have to be Papa huh you don't have to be pumped up you shoe ain't getting pumped now I mean we need two pumps and buy some out because it's not working right I'll clap my own hands out the church I'm not trying to hinder nobody hurt nobody doing but to get something to you that almost a year ago I started on in the back of because see it puts too much dependence look like on us and not on Jesus Christ but just remember Adam was the word and the word of Jesus Christ he was an impartation of God so it's every child well we got really going hey man page 591 in the spiral book who I am victory that day he said me free and made my [Music] is very throne my life's no longer line down and out because the difference in their love when he loves me to death I'm down hi to praise his name Oh [Music] who I can see just who I am [Music] I'm a part of my savior I'm a part of his world it's a revelation of who on Calvary done to redeem grunt the King of Kings became my Savior this is God's great mystery of love expressed to me that Christ and might be made one Oh [Music] [Applause] [Music] I can see just who my part of my savior I'm a part of his world it's a revelation of who Who am I I'm a child of God I'm a born-again Christian God started his plan in his purpose and even going to achieve it whether we get our part and do what we're supposed to be doing is up to that us on that mark he just makes it available I'm a part of his so we have to make our plans just let everything go in that order father we thank you for this day and we ask you to help us as we go home Lord be with the people take care of everything on the highways and things and Lord just bless us open thy word that we may speak truly they are waiting all the way down through the earth where this little bride to reach her place just help us in Jesus let me say this in the notes of carnal illustration I talked to brother Dean Gideon brother Harrison him about it because it kind of interested me about karate and this was their definition in karate you got a mentor a God that teaches you on but as you train in the karate you bind an oath of yourself that you never fight your mentor now you know that ain't kept you know better than that I'm just saying the the rules of coming in your binding never to fight your mentor you bow out because he taught you what you know but I also know this that they didn't know [Music] a real true karate never tells you all he knows he's always got a little something a real true preacher don't always tell you everything he knows he's got some little things along the way that might appear so watch them you might see it as it appears among us because it is God and we believe it you're just me it's pray one for another [Music]
