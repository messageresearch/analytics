Fellowship together for a little while and just take care of the weather and clear clear it all out and let everything be all right and we love you and we thank you in Jesus name amen we always reading in Ephesians so everybody knows where that's at Ephesians 1 verse3 and then we'll go to Philippians 2 right blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who has blessed us with all spiritual blessings were in Heavenly places in Christ according as he had chosen Us in him when before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love watch having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself what according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he hath made us accepted in the Beloved in whom we have Redemption through his blood the Forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace wherein Heath abounded toward us in all wisdom and Prudence having made known unto us what now the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he has purposed in himself his plan and purpose we'll get to it in a little while that in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together and one all things in Christ both which are in heaven and which are on earth even in him in whom also we have obtained an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will notice all the way down his will his will his will his will his will all right that we should be to the Praise of his glory which first trusted in Christ in whom you also trusted after that you heard the word of Truth The Gospel of your salvation in whom also after you believed you were sealed with that Holy Spirit of Promise which is the earnest of our inheritance what until the Redemption of the purchased possession in other words bodily Redemption coming forth unto the praise of his glory now we'll go over to Philippians 2 verse five says let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus now that's not his natural mind right all right who being in the form of God cuz see if he' had been his natural mind he couldn't have had that thought who being in the form of God thought it not robbery to be equal with God but made himself of no reputation and took upon him the form of a servant and was made in the likeness of men and being formed in the fashion as a man he humbled himself and became obedient unto death even the death of the Cross you may be seated the Lord add his Blessing to the reading of the word uh we've got one of the ones buzzing up here somewhere Josh so uh there you go I just wanted to get that out of the way cuz it does cause a little problem all right now we're trying to continue our thought from um the last messages when we were speaking on talking about the mind of God all right and uh I hope you're following me what I'm talking about on it because there is a point that we know for certainty that God fornew all things amen or else he wouldn't be God so all right and he knew everything that would ever be and ever would be and and all like that and just because that we have been thought of in the mind of God doesn't make us that's right to the right place cuz he thought of Judas he thought of Jacob have I loved and Esau have I hated uh you know he thought of that he knew that by his for knowledge of what's doing now we're going to uh drop down a little bit towards the Earthly form tonight and then pick up the Lord willing Sunday to continue on our thought but what is it we're talking about in in his mind not just something that he thought of because he thought of everybody right all right so then it doesn't make you Eternal just because he thought of you in his mind right all right it doesn't put it to where that we can say well if I was just in the mind of God that's all I want to be and well Judas his car was there too so now what are you talking about all right so then we're talking about the part of being in his mind as being part of the mind not just what God would be thinking of right you know right man but part of the very one that was doing the thinking we spent the whole Services all of these week after week and this is not number 13 trying to drive that part home about Genesis 1 126 and 27 the creation of man and that that man was part of God Amen not just a human element brought into existence that's Genesis uh 1:26 and 27 which was not just in the mind of God but part of God all right CU he said let us make man in our own image and let them have dominion all right that's right and he called then later he called their name Adam amen all right which means the beginning and the doing all right so it wasn't just one person he was thinking of there of Adam and Eve because we've proved that part by trying to come through in the message and I hope you followed it that we don't think too much about Eve but Eve had to be in the original creation as much as Adam all right because she was a part of him and she was there even after Adam was placed in the Genesis 2 man you know the the flesh man that the one 26 and 27 was put over into that Eve was still in theophany right all right see then she had to come forth from there into human flesh you know like Adam and she came from Adam in literal human flesh and she came from God by the original impartation of Life all right now so then in thinking about it we we were talking about it like this that it's not God like 154 149 excuse me Church H book it's not like God God's not like a man with a blueprint that he draws up what he's going to do he doesn't have to do that all right I gave it to you in the message and we'll reread it after a while where brother Brandon said it was talking about the a vision of what he wanted in his mind you say well now and I thought about this the other day you say do you mean God has Visions well I will remind you that Jesus said what I do nothing until I see a vision you say oh you missed that word no that's that's what brother brandham said he said I do nothing unless there's a vision he had a vision to do he had a vision of of going on and then coming back and raising Lazarus there was a vision part to that well then is no problem to think about the vision of God all right now we know that our thoughts Isaiah 55 and 8 and N our thoughts are not like God's thoughts his thoughts are so much higher than our thoughts until our thoughts are not even in the picture all right then we got down to bringing one of the last quotes that we brought and brother Bram was talking about it so I put it back into the the message to use it tonight but uh that's a masterpiece where he's talking about the vision where he said the reality what was a vision in him was in his thinking and what was that talking he had in his mind what he wanted and he wanted to make man in his own image he wanted to make something in in reality of what was a vision to him and what was in his thinking all right then in doing that see we know for a certainty that it's not just God setting up thinking about something and it's not to just say in his mind because everybody's in his mind all right but being a part of the Mind itself like I've always told you I don't want to be just what God thinks of I want to be a part of the Thinker there's a whole lot of difference in that I want to be a part of the one that's doing that because that to me is the scripture we read in Philippians is that let this mind be in you which was in Christ Jesus and that's not his human brain that is eternal life or the baptism of the Holy Ghost bringing it down to you and I of being that part and then when it says that see because he had that mind you know right he thought it not robbery to be equal with God why because he was God so he had no problem of of any of his thoughts right so then that mind that's in you and I is the baptism with the Holy Ghost the new birth eternal life into our soul bringing us into that position all right now we want to pick up our thought tonight and try to take it on because we're talking about the thoughts of God remember the thoughts of God are Eternal MH all right now that doesn't I said make everything Eternal that he thought of but he can't change that thought once he said Jacob have I loved Esau have I hated no matter what Jacob done couldn't have turned him away and no matter what Esau tried to do would not change his mind amen why because he'd already thought it and remember we were given that that once he thinks it and speaks it there's no way I gave you a bunch of quotes the other day there there's no way that the devil in all of his demons can stop the plan of God right there's no way it can change it the devil can't do it right it don't matter what we think of this that or the other there's no way to for that Satan can change God's plan because because he's going to have it all right now that's what we want to deal that's the reason I put that message there of the positive thoughts of God in his mind as to not being like our thoughts that we could change them you know and do a situation and doing what he thought of in the beginning that's right was real and that's it you say well then brother Dale if he thought of me being lost will I be lost if he thought of you being lost you will be lost well then there's no need of me trying well you know what you just prove the point cuz if you're not willing to try he gave you a free moral agency so then who's making the point of us being lost right we are right am you know and it's it's like I tried to preach a message I remember years ago about something that I know what brother Brown says about Satan put us in the pawn shop I know the quotes Okay but I was trying to make a point out of it that you know really we put ourselves in the pawn shop when we reach the age of accountability that's right you said well the devil made me do it well I don't blame him for everything you may do it you may try to cough out you know and and blame it all on him and I don't do it I thought think you and I have the biggest portion of it I don't I think he's gone on vacation that he doesn't even have to fool with us because he's let us be so intellectually brained in our mind until he doesn't have to do anything anymore but we put our own selves in the pawn shop right because we made the choice to be lost amen so don't blame Adam and Eve for it and don't blame God all right now but what I want us to think on I want us to think about something that is very valuable to me in in thinking about the word of God and how great it is and how wonderful it is how perfect it is and the things of his word and how that he can't change it it's got to be true right but we just got to find it to make sure we got it lined up the way he says it cuz now we get our own ideas we say well the Bible says it yeah the Bible said Judas went and hung himself now I take another scripture and say you go do likewise now what are you going to do that's see it it's silly in our mind that we allow it to uh work work so much I guess is the best way to say it because you know we allow it to be done but I want you to think about now to keep your thought into the mind or thinking about in God's mind as being not just him sitting down thinking about it but it being his very thoughts we've been through message after message of the thoughts and the attributes of God and you know tying it together that those thoughts are his attributes and his attributes is part of him and he never gained any attributes coming down he always had those attributes all right see then we all we got to do is just line up that was kind of the last thought I put on my notes is we just got to find the plan and purpose that God has and then let's fall in line right right you know well we know what the plan and purpose is so let's just try to fall in line with it so let's let's pick up some thoughts and I want you to it may be surprising in a minute when we if we can get that far okay but bear with me go ahead and pull up number one uh brothers and let's just read what brother brownon said on the message called I know my redeemer liveth 1958 e13 look God's purpose can never be defeated there's nothing can defeat it so how happy ought we to be resting upon that beautiful revelation of the word of the Living God that there is neither things present nor things that can come there is no sickness no sorrow death no pearls no nothing can separate us from the purpose of the Living God that's right now you can't be done we we if there's anything way to do it we're going to be separating ourselves is the only way it can be done it's our our problems exactly is not just taking what he says now look what he said what God has imagined in his mind what God has purposed in his heart to bring to P there's no demon there's no power there's nothing can ever separate God's Great Immortal and watching me eternal plan it must be as God has said now that's the thought for tonight the thought for tonight is the Eternal plan yes but brother Dale the way you're sounding you're bringing it out and and coming down hard and strong about predestination and you're making it like that nobody's got a choice we haven't even got to Earth yet where we can make one that's right I'm still up in heaven amen I was listening the other day to brother brand and he was bringing he was and he was bringing about about the old black man you know the first one he ran into and said he started off on the up in heaven and said brought him down the horizontal rainbow and he said where were you when the morning Stars sang together and the sons of God shouted for Joy you know what brother Ram in enjoyed that he refers to that a lot that's right why because the man had something that's right all right so let's think about it think about an eternal plan now the best way we can talk about an eternal plan it just means it's Eternal and that's it it it's not something can be added to if it's Eternal all right so he had an eternal plan well then if he had an eternal plan I just don't I don't know I just I don't know whether I'm to be saved or not well you're the one making the choice right that's right it's not God am he gives us the choice amen so you got to make your own choice of your own thinking all right now an eternal plan that can something Eternal cannot be added to or taken from right so if he had an eternal plan see then it's going to come forth amen yeah but you're leaning too much on that old predestination Doctrine well we ain't got down to the four knowledges and talking yet so just bear with me you know and and think about about the things that we're talking about have I brought any Doctrine yet that seems to be uh anti message or antis scriptural if it is come and tell me about it because all I've been doing is dealing with the fact of what was in God before the foundation of the world Amen that he had all of those attributes within him right when he was self-existing that's right amen right see then he was already a father he was already a Healer he was already a savior no he couldn't be a savior cuz it was nothing lost you're making him become a savior right you're making it like well something happened I got to change the course you're not talking about the God I'm talking about that's right that could never change his mind about his word amen you're changing his mind well well it could no but I got now i' got to do something you know yeah that's the way we think but it won't work am right why don't you get in your mind sometimes of about a great Eternal God and think about how great he is all right see then let's talk about is that we read in Paul here that he speaks of a mystery and he said there was a mystery there that we read there in Ephesians all right now mystery is something that has not been made known right all right and even after it's made known because you Time Mystery to the word revelation the same thing that it's even though it's made known a supernatural element will remain despite the mystery the fact spite the fact that it's revealed to you there'll be things that are left don't worry about it I thought we believ the prophet said that we'd even get a message of cheer down to the endless ages after this world was over with do you think our little peanut brain understanding of what we have now is all there is of god this is just enough to get us started right MH we wouldn't be able it's just like it is with what no man can call Jesus the Christ what except it be by the baptism of the Holy Ghost all right right and see are we trying to limit him that way or what are we but let's think about it that this great Eternal God he wanted to let himself be expressed right now let's read that and just pick up a few little thoughts go ahead to number two which is Christ is a Myst of God reveal and watch what he says now God's secret mystery he had before the world began now back in the back part of God's mind now that's beyond anything we can comprehend right right so it would take a prophet to have to go back into the mind of God and bring it out right okay now back in the back part of God's mind there was something that he was trying and was going to achieve what now he was trying that's looks like well he he didn't but said and was going to achieve that's not a choice then and he had a motive in doing it in order to let himself be expressed because first there wasn't even a Moon Star atom molecule or anything he was God but he actually wasn't God at the time because God is an object of worship that's just our wording and there wasn't nothing to worship him so what did he do he made angels and they worshiped him all right now so think about it so in his great mind he wanted these attributes to be expressed now what did he say back up above there in order to let himself be expressed now look at all the attributes that God has and look at we'll just take a few right here and in him was love that would be one to cover the whole vast coverage of all things right in him him was to be father in him was to be son in him was to be a savior and him was to be a Healer and all these great attributes that we see already expressed they were in him they were in God all right now whatever attribute you could think of place it within that paragraph and your thinking that whatever you would think about him as to be remember he had a motive in order a motive in doing it in order to let himself be expressed now so whatever you want to put there father healer son uh savior whatever these attributes were we see already ready expressed they were in God to begin with all right now those attributes being in him now as I said the reason I'm putting that because when we get on over just in a few minutes the Lord willing we're going to pick up something that will seemingly shock the point but I want you to think about it that no matter what after you can think of put it in the Eternal God as already being there but not made manifest right amen right y amen see just not being made manifest all right now go on down to where we got what we got number five 105 now God had a purpose and a hidden mystery I love that now you know what goes on down below here and I'm not going to try to express anything just plainly say you know what goes on down below there where brother Brown talks about under our seventh mystery and the reason I love that is because when you do read over there in Revelation 10 and it comes down to verse 7 I believe it is what does it say in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery it does not say Mysteries right come on it says mystery right because there is one mystery that will tie up every mystery together into a bundle right Yen amen that's the great mystery that we're talking about all right now what now God had a purpose in a hidden Mystery and that's what I won't speak on the churches morning the hidden Mystery that God that he had in his mind before the world ever began and how that watch I love this one and how that it's unfolded itself right down to this present hour that we're living how wonderful a man could speak under the anointing of the Holy Spirit he didn't say we see how it's unfolded it all the way down to the millennium the future home the things that's why I enjoyed brother Joe Green last amen Wednesday when he was speaking about you know positive attitude faith I love people with positive attitude amen I hate somebody that well I don't know I'll try to do that you [Music] know everybody want wonders well how in the world brother Dale did you ever learn to do all kind of carpenter work wiring and plumbing and stuff like that when you never went to in school you know how I learned I learned because that the fact I used to pay people to do it and they goofed up so much till I just decided I'd start trying to do it myself and you know what I wound up to doing a pretty decent job of it even bragging on my own s but it'll work Richard thought I was going to burn his house down one time because I was trying to back feed some power into his house he was screaming I was going to burn his house down I said just calm down you know I know what I'm doing but listen down to this present hour there is no tomorrow you enjoy that with brother Joe there is no tomorrow when we get darus today No Tomorrow there's no yesterday it's done past let's live in a present tense time am let's live where the Bible said he that believeth that God is present tense all right see it's unfolded down to where we are right now amen all right where we're living right now right it's unfolded down to that part if you're listening to what he's saying and he saids we'll understand clearly on I believe what is being done all right listen God had a plan had a purpose and a hidden history it was eternal because we read that from I know my redeemer liveth and what a wonderful thing it would turn out to be and to see it if we would look at it correctly cuz what does the Bible say the Bible says the people without a what Vision what happens perish people without a vision perish now if you can't follow that uh go on your website and look up these guys that's turning against brother brandham and calling him wrong and doing all the thing if you can't read that with common sense and to see that they've lost their Vision they had a vision to begin with they had their thoughts and they were running good and great Brothers but now they have no vision so they perish Y without a vision what is your vision now I don't mean openly to see it unfold and no what is your vision what is your thoughts why are we here 50 years since the prophet left right and people thinking then they wouldn't go make it till the next week and they done some outlandish things to showing they didn't believe it right and then we laugh at Jim Jones and the situations that took place in life but listen what about it let's read that one where he talks of Masterpiece go ahead with number three where he talks about this and he's talking about said now let's turn the page of Michelangelo and close the book and let's open another book and read of the great sculpture of the almighty who before there was a world and before before the foundations was laid now watch it where's he at before there was a world and before the foundations was laid he had in his mind what he wanted he just didn't have a thought he had in his mind what he wanted look what he wanted and he wanted to make man in his own image watch he wanted to make something in reality of what was a vision to him what was in his thinking you see he wanted to make man when did he make man when is he talking about making that man when did he make the Genesis 1: 126 and 27 man he created the Flesh of the the human element that we call Adam on the sixth day right right and even in the writing out of the scriptures you got six days of creation and then you drop to when you do you hit to 126 and 27 and that's in the rest of God right and that goes back that when did he create this spiritual man before the foundation of the world right not as a creation but as an impartation of his own life are you following me see then you can't accuse me of saying well you're you're taking sides of this you're doing this that on predestin we ain't even got down to the Earth yet we're we're still like the old black man we're running around up in heaven we're coming down the horizontal rainbow I've been enjoying it I don't know where you have or not you some of you think it's just dried up and dead and all like that but that's that's your business I'm just having me a good time because I think about the word of God now what about this man we've given these but what about this man and look what brother randam calls him go ahead with number four and you'll see all these Mark out if you could see my notes and and you'll see Joe and him having to jump backwards and forwards because I try my best to cut down as much as I can to keep from it being boring and giving you too many quotes cuz if you're not going to believe one quote with the fact of knowing that brother Dale's laying got it laid on his desk if you want some more I got plenty of them laying there if you're not going to believe it that well that's just one place he said that well you're the one that's slowing this whole thing down right you're the one that's slowing it down not me I'm W to just give you the quote and say there's where the Prophet said it let's move amen you know let's go look what he says questions and answers in 1953 he's asked a question now let us who Father and Son make man in our own image now if a man was made something like that little sacred light Yonder or something like that it could not be seen which is a spiritual being he manifested or unfolded himself a little more in more to make a trenity of himself by father Son and Holy Spirit and here was God unfolding himself now down into let us make man which was his son an offspring from him he desired to make a man right but how did he desire to make the man just make the man we just have a man we make a man we just do the man was to be an offspring right M all right man in her own image he was a supernatural being and let him have dominion know the cattles of the fielding and so forth that's now a supernatural being what he wanted to do to bring the vision forth and the vision and what was his plan and purpose what was he trying to achieve we look at it as being uh healer savior Redeemer uh things like that we we don't like that sun that brother Brandon puts in there you know we we we get a little messed up in there when when brother randam like he said there would make a man make father make a son something like the beginning that he was something like the theophany man that he was a supernatural being we don't like to deal with the sun because that throws us to a point of having to think how could it be a son well I want to ask you a question how can it be that that being that was brought into existence of 126 and 27 could be anything other than a son that's right may I ask you that question how could it be anything other than a son yes but sons has beginnings and sons has and they'll have endings and we don't believe in Eternal sunship but we believe in Eternal godship may I quote you that one that's a direct quote from the prophet we don't believe in Eternal sunship but we believe in Eternal godship who was the son that created all things according to Colossians 1 Hebrews 1 John 1 Ephesians I believe it's right 3 and N Jesus Christ created all things and there was not anything made that was made that he didn't make is that summing up all of that and you know what he was called a Son of God but he wasn't a son like a second person right he was God made manifest in another form when the logos it came out from God as the prophet would call it the Son of God what did he say it was he said it's just God in another form that's right right it's just God in another form but he's an offspring from God an offspring go ahead to number five the identified Masterpiece of God heern our thoughts from Michelangelo God Almighty who in the beginning before there was a day or a dawn or of a day before there was an atom or a molecule God in his mind had man what a man should look like I know you don't like for me to stop because when I stop it's always something to try to help you but it generally hinders you so if man was made a man what was God I leave that for you to think about if God was M if man was made in the image of God even if he just made to look like him y right what is God yeah but but God is not real until he come in flesh sorry I thought Moses saw him right and saw the back part of a man I thought in Hebrews about seven it's is it 74 where it's talking about mzd and it says the man right right right the man in but see is your god real that's my problem with people is trying to get them to see how real God is that's right all right but look God in it had God in his mind had man what a man should look like what he should be and what he should act like and he wanted that man what to be part of him so he made man in his own image in the likeness of God created he man oh when God in the beginning made this masterpiece something that reflected his thoughts it's all right this man was an offspring of God this man was part of God this man he had back there go ahead to number six questions and answers on Hebrews what do we do well my deared brother my dear sainted sister before the foundation of the world when God created You In His Image or created The Man In His Image and created the woman in the image of the man for the glory of the man he made you at theophany just like himself when he said let us to the creatures that he had made let us make man in our own image and our likeness a theophany God had never become flesh yet he was in a theophany so now what did he make a theophany man right did he ever mention that while he was here go ahead to number seven Divine Healing 1954 Jesus told his disciples I knew you before the foundation of the world before the world began he knew it all things was made and ordained there we're just working according to the scales the schedule rather Jeremiah Jeremiah 1:4 I believe it is or 4:1 I forgot now I think it's 1:4 God told Jeremiah said before you was even formed in your mother's wound I knew you and Sanctified you and ordained you a prophet to the Nations is that right how did he have anything to do with it it isn't you're born that way now you agreed with me a few weeks ago when I mentioned a few things that I would get to on speaking about how the prophets were predestinated not just in God's mind the prophets were predestinated amen well now if the prophets were predestinated just remember those prophets in the Old Testament were not in the body of Christ and if they were predestinated from God eternally to bring the word of the age what about a people to live that word is it that's right okay go ahead with the next one number eight don't question and answerers on Hebrews but it's a different 8:48 now there you are that's the way we are here we come from a higher being in the beginning we were in the image of God the veil in the darkness keeps us from knowing it now knowing it now but Jesus told his disciples he was with them before the foundation of the world see we were we can't know it now but you was in the beginning and if this Earthly Tabernacle be dissolved we have one already waiting Hallelujah and then we move into that this theophany that we once lived so we can eat and shake hands and the souls under the altar crying how long now if you're reading what he just said you move into this theophany what we were once live all right remember we're still talking about eternal life all right who is this male chesd he said not your being here so we're not dealing with any fleshly things we haven't even come into the natural creation yet that will begin in the Sunday service is one of the two we will talk about the natural creation of mankind and bring it into this that we can see but we're staying here as a plan and a purpose of God that he had before the world that he was going to have amen Offspring now if he was a father you remember I clipped that a little bit a couple about four weeks ago there was talking about that before the world ever begun he was already God because the Angels worshiped him and that made him God in manifestation I clipped it a little bit and didn't say much about it because I love to do that and then one day just lay it on you and let you think about it hoping that you'll remember it now we read many times that he was a father well he didn't have to wait until mankind come into the world to be a father the Genesis 1 126 and 27 man made him the father before the foundation of the world Amen are you with me that's right he didn't have to wait until he created something natural in flesh that's right because the natural in flesh is not the exact image of God is it may look like and be that but it's not that what's the exact image of God and likeness a supernatural being the word right and see before the foundation of the world then if we wouldn't back there if our names may I quote it where you'll at least agree with this the prophet said if our names were not written in the L's book of life before the foundation of the world it'll never be written there you agree with what he said well if you agree what he said then there's got to be one thing about it there had to be a record right there had to be something took place back there and see when he brought this Offspring this 126 and 27 man into being that made him father right he doesn't have to do anything else that made him father in manifestation because that's the image he wants it don't matter about this a big fat ugly pretty round skinny this ain't what he's talking about amen this is not the image and likeness of almighty God Amen yet I do believe that he was a man amen absolutely yes all right amen but if you get in the point what I'm talking about the 126 and 27 man was was made in exact image because it's exactly him made manifest in another form now if you agreed while ago that the father that brother brile emphasize it where he said he said there he was he said the father was sitting there just paraphrasing it he said then out from him goes the logos the speech go back to questions and answers on Genesis and listen and he said out from that went the logos the speech the Son of God yep that's right he said now that was not another person that was God in another form right yes called a son right well why can't you believe then the eternal life that you have within you today right we're not I thought if we believe that we were HS of God and join HS with Christ and I thought that if he said over there where we read in Philippians that he thought it not robbery to be equal with God now here's where you're going to jump and forget why can't we believe that by the baptism of the Holy Ghost in our soul the eternal life we have is equal with God because it is God right amen is it another person no no it's God made manifest in another form that's right amen sir you see the that's why the Oneness people they say that Jesus was the life form of God if you take a Oneness he's like your finger brother BR I'm going say he's one like your finger if you really talk to them and I have they'll tell you that Jesus was the life form of God I differ with them totally amen right I believe I'm looking at the Bride of Jesus Christ amen and by looking at the Bride of Jesus Christ I'm seeing God in another form the life form for the Gentile dispensation is the Bride of Jesus Christ I said Gentile dispensation then he goes to the Jews through two witnesses and they do and they become the life form but we are the last form I thought that we believe that the Bride of Jesus Christ were the children of God Amen I thought even the in the book of Acts understood that when he says Paul he says and we are his offspring y amen come on I thought the bride would be the what the final voice to the final age quoting the rest of it under her messenger that's right amen without her Messengers we bride forget it junk garbage run on that's why that folks I've got to put everything I got into this message absolutely I can't do like these other guys is do and and got something left over that they can just run off to it you know that's right where they corrected this and they've corrected that and they're wrong here and so and so is one that corrected so we need to follow so and so yeah I thought she was the final voice to the final age under her messenger which means she is to bring only the word he problem right amen that's right all right so that's the final voice is the word of God through the prophet's message delivered to the Saints right all right now I don't ask you to raise a hand to agree with me I just ask you to consider the thoughts for tonight cuz that was what I was aiming at the other day to consider the thoughts that the man that God wanted before the found foundation of the world would be his offspring right not just a human being a people he was made a father when the 126 man 27 man come into being in him as what he brought forth he become a father right he didn't have to wait until he created us in flesh to be father that's right no he was already a father am now when you deal with healer savior you got to wait until the fall comes how many remembers that message about five or six weeks ago that I tried my best to explain that I said they these things here will take place they were taking place in heaven they don't have to have no earthly being to make these manifest that he was God cu the Angels worshiped him he was father because he brought his being his children his offspring that's right amen right into being we'll call her by another name let's call her by another name when we get a couple of quotes let's call that man or that being go ahead one number eight oh excuse me that's the one we just read go ahead with number nine we just read number eight cuz we're changing courses now just for a little bit so I would listen very closely because we're going to bring out something that maybe you had not considered to fit within this category of where we're at we were in Christ The Mystery of God revealed a while ago when we were trying to bring out that he had a plan and a purpose and Etc that he was going to see it achieved he was going to have these things we went through that there's no way to change the fact that he's going to do this now look what he says this is paragraph 107 he has showed or revealed thas about the mystery the plan the purpose the goal that he had he has showed or revealed it in every TP that's in the Bible the mystery y the mystery he showed her revealed in every type that's in the Bible watch him therefore the entire Bible is a revelation of God's mystery in Christ h the entire Bible is an expression of one goal that God had one purpose he wanted to achieve in the entire Bible and all the acts of the of the Believers in the Bible has been in top and expressing what God's Great goal is and now in this last day he has revealed it and shows it but God's help he said we'll see it right here this morning what the Lord has had in his mind all along and has expressed it y right now are you with me now he's picking up the Believers in the Bible right and would not the Believers in the Bible be his offspring is that right that's right the Believers in the Bible take the names of the the Believers out and what have you got nothing they had to be a Paul they had to be a Peter they had to be a James they had to be a John they had to be a Moses they had to be a phoh I mean uh it had to be Pharaoh for the other side but what about it now do we believe that before the foundation of the world that he had all of this in that being that he was and that his offspring was already there with him may I quote the scripture where were you when I laid the foundation of the world the morning Stars sang together and the sons of God shouted for Joy amen I thought brother brandham explained that as being when they saw the Plan of Redemption or the Plan of Salvation coming into view was the reason they were shouting before the world so you know what there just no way for us to remember it but those with eternal life today now come on get me in the right place those with eternal life today not everybody in the world those with eternal life in their soul today that eternal life was before the foundation of the world that's right now if not then you're the one that's messed up that's right amen when the morning Stars sang together and the sons of God shouted for Joy when they seen the Plan of Redemption yeah but that's too close to Mormon Doctrine I know the doctrine so don't worry about it I know what they believe they believe that we was all up in heaven and we all decided we wanted to come to Earth where we could make our father be a great father and and a Healer and a savior and things and all but if it wouldn't but for one thing to show you where they're wrong at and I'm not picking on Doctrine that's none of my business but you know in their Doctrine they believe that the devil had the plan to save everybody I talked with a man that knew what he's talking about that the devil had a plan to save everybody and Jesus had a plan to just save so many and father took Jesus's plan over the devil's plan that would be enough to reject any thoughts of Mormonism and their thoughts I'm not go find somebody and talk to him I spent eight hours on the line with a man one day I knew him he knew me he knew about me and this mind I knew him he said what are we going to talk about I said explain the Mormon Doctrine to me I said we got 8 hours think you can get it done he said we'll try I said now I'm not going to argue with you but at once in a while I'm going to say wait a minute now is this what you're saying you know I want to make sure that I understand 8 hours later I could have took the doctrine of the two Soul people of this message and laid it identically in the Mormon doctrine of pre-existence all right not trying to be nasty trying to be right cuz you see I got to know what I'm talking about that's right right but what about this great mystery what about this point that a prophet would make that we come from a higher being that we were there as the eternal life that's within us not peoples now not bodies not Spirits not Souls of anything we're looking at but not just in God's mind but to be part of the very God itself there's his offspring if it would call you his offspring on Earth how much more would it be there when the morning Stars s together in the sons of God shouted for Joy right the prophet saying Jesus told his disciples that I was with you before the foundation of the world Amen that you was in the beginning you can't know what he said but you was in the beginning all right then we went into the acts of the Believers down Through the Ages would you not agree at least with the New Testament form of the baptism of the Holy Ghost coming into our hearts and souls that would make us The Offspring of God if you don't agree with that then my Lord what are you agreeing with I mean well I never all I want to do is just get my kid saved that's what a man told me one day I backed off because I wanted to tell him if he'd have lived right and done right before him it might have helped what I was trying to do but I'm not that dirty I'm not that mean there's a heart down in this man that beats that cries at night to try to find a way to express what God has made known by way of a prophet to you and I amen what is this great mystery brother Brandon simplify it to us we can talk about back there we can talk about down Through the Ages as being The Offspring of God simplified all right go ahead with number nine excuse yeah number nine no no number 10 you do got number nine paragraph 184 Christ a mystery look what he says this is going on the way over into the book look what he comes to he says predestinated he said there's the mystery what is the mystery of Revelations 10:7 when the days of the voice of the seventh angel begin to sound the mystery singular it does not say Mysteries there read your Bible it's summed up all with this message in the end time that's why I believe this message is a headstone to the church I believe that I always have taught it I don't mind telling you what I believe look predestinated THS the mystery he before Christ or anything else was ever on earth you see his great mystery that he chose the bride now there is an eternal purpose and plan there's predestinated which means Destiny determined beforehand I didn't write this that he chose the bride now watch he knows so much of the truth he has to put it together for us to understand look knowing Eve would fall not just choosing a bride not just there's many women down here and I'll choose a bride knowing Eve would fall from disbelieving the word knowing that she would fall but he would choose a bride that would not fall that would hold to that word regardless of what all the rest of the world had to say about it they would hold to that word they are predestinated to stand there the adoption of children by Jesus Christ predestinated the church to that great glorious stand he predestinated a bride he predestinated offspring he predestinated his own children amen cuz there's you seed y there's your seed it's not the not the person that comes predestinated eternally right 154 Church a book he said but it's the seed of word all right so it's not me and you looking what you're looking at it's not this that you're looking at is predestinated eternal we're going to get to it this is for knowledge right amen but God before the world knew what we'd look like we read that to start with didn't we did he knew what we'd look like listen look what he says on go ahead number 11 identification 64 216 paragraph 58 but see all that is is displaying showing by type like the whole Bible God coming together with a redeemed Bri wife of Bride that God had in his mind before the foundation of the world now we read to start with that he had in his mind to make Man In His Image are you beginning to catch on to that that he he had in his mind to make man in his own image he had in his mind to make his offspring to bring his children into being now look what he calls him he calls him a wife cuz remember it is brother dick likes this he's on the internet he'll Scout over in Revelations uh what is it 19 or 13 which one where it said and his wife hath made herself ready it don't say and his bride says his wife has made herself ready a bride that God had in his mind for the foundation world look that was the attributes of God being displayed and now to make a character that could redeem this woman it had to be something greater than her to redeem her and you ever notice so now you know who he's talking about who he had to make okay one more what about it we read in Ephesians bring up 13 first to 12 one we read in Ephesians having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he had purposed in himself remember he swore by himself abut right that it what that in the dispensation of the fullness of times you might gather together in one all things in Christ both which are in heaven and which are on earth even in him what that in the dispensation of the fullness remember the quote we just read he would choose a bride knowing she would fall are you with me but knowing that he would predestinate a people that would not fall that's why they without us cannot be made perfect that's what he's talking about that in the dispensation of the fullness of time in other words the end of times somebody's going realize what's going on in whom also we have obtained what an inheritance remember Jesus never gave us an inheritance he only come to deliver the inheritance to us he never gave us an inheritance that's brother random come on our inheritance was eternal life before the foundation of the world Amen I'm quoting brother brandham all right in whom also we have obtained an inheritance what being predestinated determined before the world ever begun that there'd be a group of people in the end time that would not may I quote it from looking at the book I can't get the name uh where he said that she won't fall like Eve fell God of this evil age I guess no no it's not it it's a green book okay forget it I'll get the quote according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will go back and read will will will how much I told you when I started that we would not read anywhere else but Ephesians 1 3-14 how mean you remember that why because within that is the fall the the the before the world the coming into the world the fall of mankind and the Regeneration of mankind is in Ephesians 1 3 through 14 I don't you have to go anywhere else in the Bible but think about it now watch this last part go ahead with number 12 this is from Christ of mystery God reveal paragraph one 54-6 he is the first fruits of the Resurrection is that right congregation says amen watch then what is he he is the head of the body which is his church bride uh-huh then the bride body must follow the head for it is part of his resurrection and might have a little a little bit to do with his mystery some way in there you know could maybe something what did he say she's part of his resurrection and she's part of his mystery it's impossible for it not to go oh my it's part of God's mystery how God revealed himself here and raised it up by the word so he Reveals His church and raises it up by the same word it is a part part of his threefold mystery you mean to say that you and I are a part of God's mystery part of a three-fold mystery I thought according to Christ the mystery God revealed that the three-fold mystery was what all God was he poured into Christ that's right on Christ he pours into the church I thought brother ROM said do you want these that the bride would be the fullness of the godhead bodily in the last days amen of course that was quoted to a big man in this message you know what he said hog wash well he can hog all his was he wants to I don't care I didn't say it brother brandham did am in other words he was bling making fun of brother brandham that's his own business cuz that's what he done he said Hogwart of course the same man said said it this way he said the third pull was for brother brandom and Jesus Christ and not for nobody else now may I quote brother brandom I thought brother brandom said the third pool was far the bride and the church and to the totally lost he even said the third pull is to the church y now you know he ain't talking about bride there come on would you see what I'm talking about see unveiling of God is great you ever notice brother Brandon preached that and read the message and listen to it very carefully the unveiling of God and he brought him down and unveiled him on Earth but go to a message called The Mighty God unveiled and listen to that one he brings it right down to the church she's part of the mystery and got to be reveal that's right what am I trying to do brother what are you trying to do brother there I'm trying to reveal you y now get upset with me and all and just get all he fatter in your minds and things and well boy he's just so deep he can't understand we can't follow what's more simple than for me talking about you you see that's why I don't make L of nobody I don't make no fun of nobody that ever turns against me I don't do nobody I don't say will they or not he boy BL God he when he was meeting on uhuh because see I want to see everybody there right I know when realize it won't happen but that's right still what's the problem why can't somebody differ with you a little bit and you not get so upset and mad that's right like I told you about a man leaving a church because they asked him to take up an offering and he was a preacher in that church and he said a preacher is not supposed to take up an offering and he left the church you go around and check all these little doctrines that people leave churches about you didn't ever hear Brother random talk like that that's he always had open arms for everybody cuz he said that's between you and God he never throw off on nobody he always spoke well of his enemies like they said Billy Paul I believe was the one that said it one of them did said you couldn't tell the difference in brother Brown's enemies and his friends that's right well it's like I've said how would it be that I'm over here throwing off on brother collie and I'm really lambasting him and I'm just calling his name and I'm rubbing him over the and he's wouldn't be here tonight but he'd be at home on his knees praying and saying God help that man he don't he don't mean it just help him now which one's God going to hear he put your little feelings in the city into your bres and sit out on them but follow the word of God amen amen that's all I've preached for 40 something years is the Bride of Jesus Christ to be the end time people the end of all things let's than that's right the end of all things would finish up with a little group of people called a bride are we his offspring are we his bride you need another part are we his body amen what are we what about it can you see God's plan and purpose cuz see next we're going to start towards the earth now but before we leave it can you see his plan and purpose was to share his eternal life with his children that he was going to bring his children into being now listen not to just stay some Angel form or something floating around or listen not even to stay as a theophany he wanted us in flesh amen yes sir he wanted us in flesh that's his goal and that's his doing all I want to do is be what he wants me to be yep what do you think about it what we got 119 the red book 119 the red book anybody have a need the altar open to share his eternal life with his own children to share all the glories of heaven and all the mighty things to share it with his people people he's proud of his people amen he's proud to be associated with them go ahead brother bless what about your God your
