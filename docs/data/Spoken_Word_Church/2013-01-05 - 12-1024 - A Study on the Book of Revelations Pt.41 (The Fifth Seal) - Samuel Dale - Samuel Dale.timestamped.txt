[0:00] everybody
[0:25] change your service if I can share
[0:27] something real quick
[0:28] I was going to the uh in the facility or
[0:31] work those two maintenance departments
[0:33] and if you've ever been around Maine
[0:34] this is probably getting him though
[0:36] they're a different breed of people
[0:38] different attitudes and look out some
[0:41] life and making the most money
[0:43] I went through there singing praising
[0:45] God just walking to the other shop
[0:48] somebody yelled at with some certain
[0:51] words what are you so happy about I just
[0:53] kept walking singing went back what I
[0:56] was gonna do and I come walking back out
[0:58] yelled it again at me and that's what I
[1:00] tell you what I'm happy about it
[1:02] I said it's the nature it's in me and it
[1:04] ain't me I'm just praise the Lord I just
[1:07] kept walking but you know it's
[1:10] it kind of excited me and upset things
[1:12] but I was just walking and in the spirit
[1:14] of the lower man singing
[1:16] and hopefully
[1:19] it touched a hard something there but
[1:21] you know you've got to understand work
[1:23] around maintenance people understand how
[1:24] hard that is sometimes would change your
[1:27] service

[5:43] you are our peace we love you and we
[5:46] thank you guide us now in Jesus name
[5:49] amen
[5:52] in Revelations 1
[5:55] one two three
[5:58] this is the revelation of Jesus Christ
[6:00] which God gave unto him to show unto his
[6:03] servants things which must shortly come
[6:05] to pass he sin and signified it
[6:08] by his Angel unto his servant John who
[6:11] by record of the word of God and the
[6:13] testimony of Jesus Christ of all things
[6:15] that he saw
[6:16] blessed is he that readeth what about
[6:18] just a blessing to just be able to read
[6:20] the word of God
[6:22] they that hear the words of this
[6:24] prophecy and keep those things which are
[6:27] written therein for this time is at hand
[6:30] the time of what time to understand and
[6:34] let's go over to Revelation 6
[6:37] 9-11
[6:40] and when he had opened the night verse
[6:42] the fifth seal I saw under the altar The
[6:45] Souls of them that were slain for the
[6:46] word of God and for the testimony which
[6:48] they failed and they crowned with a loud
[6:50] voice saying how long O Lord holy and
[6:53] true this thou not judge and avenge our
[6:55] blood on them that dwell on the Earth
[6:57] and white robes were given unto every
[7:00] one of them it was said unto them that
[7:03] they should rest for a little season
[7:05] until their Feller servants were also
[7:09] and their Brethren should be killed as
[7:11] they were should be fulfilled and then
[7:14] you may be seated the Lord had to bless
[7:16] him to his word
[7:19] now we come up to the park we've hit
[7:23] like a few little messages in doing this
[7:27] like we did Sunday
[7:28] to speak about their Sunday morning
[7:31] about the uh you know kind of reviewing
[7:34] kind of what we had been speaking about
[7:37] in the first four seals
[7:40] and then coming down to a position to
[7:43] talk about
[7:45] that under this fifth seal and I
[7:47] remember under all of the others uh you
[7:50] know you'll find it uh that there was a
[7:52] beast saying come and see the verse 1
[7:56] going on down verse three uh verse
[8:00] what
[8:01] uh six and then on down to verse seven
[8:05] each one of them is saying a beast is
[8:08] saying come and see
[8:10] all right but then on this fifth seal
[8:13] that we just read now there is no uh
[8:16] announcement messenger there's no combat
[8:19] Beast as we would call it and and we'll
[8:22] get to it in a minute but uh I want you
[8:25] to think on that tonight
[8:28] I tried to to express a lot of the
[8:30] thoughts are Sunday about it that you
[8:34] know uh we don't need another messenger
[8:37] that's right
[8:39] we are in the time of the fourth combat
[8:42] Beast the eagle
[8:43] so we don't need another Messenger to
[8:46] come that's right we need to get into
[8:48] the message that has been brought unto
[8:51] us we need to become that part that we
[8:55] are to be of that combat Beast because
[8:58] it's not just that brother Branham was
[9:00] the combat beast and and we have nothing
[9:02] to do we're supposed to be the part that
[9:06] fits in there and the prophet said when
[9:07] this bride gets a revelation of what
[9:11] she's doing here you know her what she's
[9:13] for and all like that and what's taking
[9:15] place the two Spirits among them and
[9:18] everything and doing those things then
[9:21] when you do
[9:23] he said
[9:25] Satan would be powerless before her
[9:28] that's right you say well I don't know
[9:30] where that'll ever come well that's what
[9:32] the prophet said it was coming so I
[9:34] believe that and that's what I'm looking
[9:36] for time to come when Satan cannot
[9:40] control your thinking and my thinking
[9:43] that we can be set in and associate in
[9:46] with God until no matter what comes or
[9:49] goes
[9:50] good or bad whatever that we just
[9:53] rejoice and say thank you Lord amen
[9:55] because that we have received you know
[9:58] these things all right
[10:01] now
[10:02] no combat Beast
[10:06] to announce I want to say the S and then
[10:08] a little bit I'll come back to it
[10:11] because it's in the message
[10:13] so you don't need one for the field six
[10:16] and seventh
[10:17] because
[10:19] the prophet has come to bring us
[10:21] sebastians all right you agree with that
[10:22] amen now so we don't need another one we
[10:25] don't have to have somebody to come in
[10:27] straighten out the message and the
[10:29] things the message is perfect the one
[10:32] who brought the message sure had
[10:34] thoughts and failures and problems right
[10:37] but he straightened them out and he told
[10:39] us the truth about what was to be and we
[10:42] cannot correct him because
[10:45] he was standing before God you know so
[10:48] we're not trying in any way to
[10:51] correcting or any point because it would
[10:53] be foolishness to do those things
[10:55] you know it'd be foolishness to
[10:57] anybody's mind to say brother random was
[10:59] wrong other than the points that he
[11:01] covered that he was wrong
[11:03] you know like the white horse rider or
[11:05] things like that he told us and he
[11:08] straightened that up now anything else
[11:11] that you're arguing about what good
[11:13] would it be to uh you know argue over
[11:16] because it ain't going to affect us
[11:18] anyway uh I don't even care about
[11:20] listening to it
[11:21] but now what I want you to notice
[11:24] tonight is one thing
[11:27] and then I said I'll come back in the
[11:29] message to it
[11:32] you'll notice there is a thing happening
[11:35] that we've just read and we'll get back
[11:37] and review this in a minute
[11:41] but see each seal one two three four
[11:47] it had symbols
[11:51] right
[11:52] yeah right my horse rider red horse
[11:54] rider black horse rider Pale Horse Rider
[11:57] it had symbols
[12:00] and it would tell about you know the
[12:02] things or the ages that it was in and
[12:04] and that was where the Prophet had
[12:06] become the eagle to express that unto us
[12:10] but if you notice in the fifth and we'll
[12:12] get back to it in the sixth and the
[12:14] seventh
[12:17] there's not a symbol
[12:19] right now I want you to hold that point
[12:21] you're going to say automatically wait a
[12:23] minute there is no
[12:26] no
[12:28] and forever I want to see it
[12:30] right we said well it says dire that
[12:33] you know
[12:35] trolled under the altar that's people
[12:38] right
[12:41] that's not a symbol
[12:44] yeah
[12:45] I know white represented people the
[12:48] black the red you know the pale
[12:51] represented people yeah but that was
[12:53] symbols
[12:55] when you come to this fifth seal
[12:59] there is no symbol right
[13:03] when you come to the Sixth Seal there's
[13:05] no symbol
[13:07] the silent seal is not a symbol
[13:13] all right
[13:15] I want you to put that in your mind and
[13:16] think about it
[13:19] I'm not saying that there's not things
[13:21] there right right that are not
[13:23] understood
[13:26] I'm not saying that now right
[13:28] I'm putting this up front then I'll back
[13:30] up on it again
[13:32] I'm not saying that there's something
[13:34] not something there that needs to be
[13:35] made known
[13:38] that's right right
[13:40] which is not a symbol it says Soldier
[13:43] under the altar now we don't know who
[13:44] that is without the prophet message
[13:47] you're coming to tell us right amen
[13:49] but that's not a symbol that's people
[13:51] all right
[13:53] well then six seal
[13:55] it just says there's an earthquake and
[13:57] all kind of pestilence and I mean it's
[14:00] not any symbol amen amen
[14:04] there's not a symbol at all under the
[14:06] seventh
[14:09] it says silence in heaven for this next
[14:11] half hour
[14:14] now write that down or jot it down and
[14:16] think about it as we go along and then
[14:19] when we come back to it you'll see
[14:20] something begin to unfold that I believe
[14:23] we need to have an understanding of you
[14:27] know in this day and time all right now
[14:31] let's just go back and let's pick up
[14:32] some things that we talked about
[14:37] um Sunday so let's go ahead and win
[14:39] number one
[14:40] I'm going to reread these because it's
[14:42] about three quotes here that we're doing
[14:44] dealing with Sunday
[14:46] but I want you to get a point from it
[14:50] the point is that when you come to this
[14:52] seal there's not an announcement
[14:59] and we're gone
[15:02] that's the two things
[15:08] all right so then there's not anything
[15:10] to be made known to us
[15:15] are you listening
[15:18] under the field sixth and seventh seal
[15:20] there's not anything to be made known to
[15:23] us to redeem us
[15:29] because we've already gone up and
[15:34] I didn't say now that there wasn't
[15:36] anything in there that we need to know
[15:38] about Redemption
[15:40] listen to my wording
[15:42] be somebody out there you're listening
[15:44] to me I know I speak
[15:46] strange and odd
[15:49] but you consider it
[15:54] is not a symbol under that seal right
[15:58] and we're done gone into rapture
[16:01] so this is not to us
[16:05] it's not even about us
[16:09] sure
[16:11] we read it and get from it what we have
[16:14] need of
[16:20] like I said there's Sunday
[16:23] the first four seals shows the Plan of
[16:25] Redemption
[16:29] right
[16:30] in the field six and seventh shows you
[16:33] how he done it amen right
[16:41] then I've encouraged you to read to see
[16:43] a book
[16:45] and to not try to read to find a mystery
[16:51] you're trying to find some secret coded
[16:53] mystery
[16:54] that nobody else did not did you ever
[16:57] see that
[16:59] well yeah all the world said it
[17:01] you know I'm talking about the people in
[17:02] the message
[17:04] like I told you you know you you get
[17:06] into your own sales and when I first
[17:08] time I went to the Tabernacle Club
[17:11] I sat down
[17:13] about 1968 you know and I sat there and
[17:17] I looked up there and there was that
[17:19] cross with
[17:21] uh NRI you know
[17:24] I wrote that down
[17:26] I thought now I found the new name of
[17:28] Jesus
[17:33] I'm gonna come out after the service I
[17:35] said brother mom
[17:36] would you mind explaining something to
[17:39] me anymore
[17:40] I said what is that i n r i
[17:43] there this over the cross from the
[17:45] church what does that mean he said it
[17:48] means Jesus Christ King of the Jews
[17:51] well
[17:53] I raced what I was thinking
[17:56] see I'm human too
[17:58] we're all looking for something instead
[18:01] of looking at it
[18:03] right I'm inviting you to read the steel
[18:05] book again
[18:07] and do not discount
[18:10] what is being said as what we would call
[18:13] a foundation
[18:16] be sealed rattle will speak for quite a
[18:18] while
[18:20] longer on the foundation
[18:23] and he does actually on the seal itself
[18:29] we just want to turn over and get the
[18:31] sealed
[18:33] no the foundation is where the mystery's
[18:36] at the key
[18:37] right because like I've always tried to
[18:40] tell you we'll keep going back over it
[18:42] till you get it
[18:44] the seals is not to the Bride of Jesus
[18:46] Christ
[18:48] the seals take place to Israel after the
[18:51] Rapture
[18:53] the man of sin sitting in the temple of
[18:55] God showing himself and he asked God
[18:56] that's the prophet is that fulfilled the
[18:59] first seal and really over into the
[19:01] seals he said yes
[19:03] well we certainly don't want to be there
[19:05] when that takes place
[19:07] because that according to my
[19:08] understanding would be right about the
[19:11] middle of the
[19:12] right about the time Armageddon sets in
[19:16] all right
[19:17] and he breaks his Covenant
[19:20] we're certainly don't want to be there
[19:21] when the sixth yield tribulation
[19:25] but that seemingly has been so hard
[19:28] to try to
[19:30] get especially ministers right
[19:33] to be able to see that statement
[19:37] we get the revelation of the seals amen
[19:41] we see before
[19:44] we see where it comes from we see where
[19:46] it starts at in Genesis and works its
[19:49] way all the way down through
[19:51] we get the revelation
[19:54] we know what's going to happen in the
[19:56] tribulation
[20:01] but we don't want to be there
[20:03] right
[20:06] even that you know people look at that
[20:07] and they say why what do you mean we're
[20:10] the bride
[20:14] so we got it right here where the
[20:15] Prophet said in the
[20:17] I believe it's in the church's book
[20:19] where he says it it's under the forest
[20:21] seal that the Rapture comes that's
[20:24] exactly right
[20:26] oh
[20:27] but it's foreseen Revelation because it
[20:31] only foreseals dealing with Revelation
[20:34] to you and I right amen
[20:36] not that we can't read field six and
[20:39] seventh and get a mystery from it no
[20:41] that's right but the fifth seal is sold
[20:43] Under The Altar and we know that to be
[20:46] Israel
[20:48] right
[20:53] but maybe we need to think about that a
[20:56] little
[21:00] and consider a few points
[21:03] so now just watch it as we go through
[21:08] and if you would on the fifth seal
[21:12] if you would read from that paragraph
[21:14] 110 through paragraph 199 around 200
[21:18] there
[21:19] you will find blood around them
[21:21] explaining the combat Beast
[21:23] and explaining like one two three four
[21:26] and what they are and what happens and
[21:28] the things that are taking place under
[21:30] that
[21:31] you know so then you would see it but
[21:34] look what he says now
[21:36] paragraph 81 through 83
[21:41] 1963 322
[21:45] notice but here when we come to this
[21:47] fifth seal now there's there's no Rider
[21:51] Goes Forth
[21:52] and there's no Beast to announce it
[21:55] it is no Rider
[21:57] no Beast right
[22:00] all right
[22:03] and watch your point to me John said
[22:05] John you he the lamb opened it and John
[22:08] saw it there was no one there to say now
[22:11] come look come see
[22:15] thank you
[22:16] no wonder you might meet no now here's
[22:19] the thing that popped in my mind today
[22:21] as I was thinking on these things
[22:24] that I was thinking that immediately
[22:25] when I say there's no combat Beast
[22:28] under the fifth seal and that there's no
[22:30] symbols
[22:32] then we're going to think that we're the
[22:33] revelated people
[22:35] that can jump up and understand these
[22:37] things
[22:38] that is true but only by way of the
[22:42] Prophet messenger
[22:45] right right everybody get that not our
[22:49] jumbled up minds and our thoughts and
[22:51] ideas and what we believe it is
[22:53] I don't hear what you believe it is or I
[22:55] don't care what I believe it is it's
[22:58] what the word says all right see that we
[23:02] can stand on that part
[23:04] so that would be maybe a thought in
[23:06] somebody's mind
[23:07] but there's no combat beings there's no
[23:09] symbols
[23:11] but remember
[23:13] before the prophet came and spoke on the
[23:17] fifth seal we did not know who those
[23:21] Souls under the altar were right
[23:24] that's right I mean
[23:26] is that true
[23:29] then that leaves us out of it don't it
[23:31] don't get so revelated until we Glory
[23:33] look what we see yeah yeah we see it by
[23:35] way of the Prophet Messenger right right
[23:37] whether you like that or not
[23:41] ice no power of the living creature
[23:44] or theirs and on the sixth eel there's
[23:47] no Beast to announce it and on the
[23:49] Senate seal there's no Beast to announce
[23:50] it no powers to announce yeah see no one
[23:55] does it on the look on them after the
[23:58] fourth seal there's no Announcement by
[23:59] any beast power from the field sixth and
[24:02] seventh not at all
[24:05] all right rolling
[24:07] he said now notice I love this as in the
[24:10] times of the writer of the four horses
[24:11] the writer singular of the four
[24:13] different horses there was a beast to
[24:15] announce the power every time the
[24:17] writers traveled another horse and come
[24:19] forth to ride another kind of a Beast
[24:21] come out and announced it that's a great
[24:23] mystery Steve that is the mystery why
[24:26] announcing the mystery okay why isn't
[24:30] there one here on the fifth seal to
[24:31] announce it
[24:33] and he asked the question why is it
[24:35] throwing you
[24:36] here it is according to the Revelation
[24:40] that the Lord Jesus gave me to Daisy or
[24:42] this morning early
[24:44] I want you
[24:45] and in fact the mystery of the church
[24:47] ages are already finished
[24:50] at this time
[24:52] right
[24:54] the time of the fifth seal
[24:59] okay
[25:01] The Mystery of the Antichrist is
[25:02] revealed at this time
[25:04] the Antichrist took these last ride and
[25:06] we found him on the Pale Horse mix with
[25:08] his many colors and rides all the way
[25:10] into prediction we get it on the
[25:12] trumpets and so forth when we teach that
[25:14] I go into it now but we you get pulled
[25:19] off the subject watch it he said I know
[25:20] we're not going to it
[25:22] okay that's the mystery that the church
[25:25] ages had already finished at this time
[25:31] now here's something for you to think of
[25:39] and watch it be perfectly right
[25:42] but you're first going to get the
[25:43] thought that I'm trying to correct
[25:46] no I'm trying to express
[25:49] into sensible terms
[25:53] when the prophet says that
[25:56] this don't happen
[25:57] this is you know
[26:00] Church age had already finished at this
[26:02] time
[26:04] now
[26:07] to take the first verse of
[26:10] chapter nine
[26:14] you know I mean the fifth sixth chapter
[26:16] verse 9.
[26:21] and then take the other verses
[26:24] remember
[26:27] this fifth sealed Jew as we'll get to it
[26:30] later is not the bride of Christ
[26:34] it is Israel as a nation
[26:37] it is not Israel of the 144 000 right
[26:44] now another something there I'm going to
[26:45] hold it
[26:47] it is not
[26:48] the 144 000. right
[26:52] the field sealed view is not
[26:57] and it's not ever Jew
[27:01] right
[27:02] LeBron said it's not these Wall Street
[27:04] bunch
[27:05] it's just money hungry
[27:09] it's only the predestinated
[27:13] are you with me
[27:16] we'll get back on that point a minute
[27:19] but just remember now
[27:22] where does this group come up
[27:25] and are killed for their testimony
[27:32] from Calvary
[27:35] until now
[27:38] right that's the best way to say it
[27:43] so it starts off in the fifth seal that
[27:46] these
[27:50] these who receive white Rogues
[27:54] their manifestation on Earth
[27:57] is during the churches
[28:05] right
[28:08] did that ring a bell
[28:11] when I think about it
[28:14] the time that they're beginning to you
[28:16] know when they're being killed and
[28:18] saying is during the church ages right
[28:23] but there's a part of that fifth seal
[28:26] that doesn't happen in the church ages
[28:29] right
[28:36] they don't get white rose
[28:39] in the church ages
[28:45] there's a part of that seal that's not
[28:47] fulfilled until after we get out of here
[28:49] until now the prophets right
[28:53] right
[28:54] he said these things is after the church
[28:57] is done gone
[29:00] and don't take place during the church
[29:02] ages
[29:07] I
[29:11] mean are you in your mind with
[29:12] automatically they're they're killed
[29:14] during the church hey that's exactly
[29:16] right
[29:18] right that's why it's not a symbol
[29:20] it's a people
[29:24] told under the altar is not a symbol
[29:26] it's a people
[29:27] the secret is to find out who it is
[29:33] not a symbol
[29:35] to find out who that is it's under the
[29:38] altar
[29:41] we know it's Israel as a nation
[29:48] Israel you know
[29:52] but it's not 144 000.
[29:58] we just read
[30:01] the scripture
[30:04] that says this group of people
[30:08] will receive white rose
[30:16] before the 144 000 are killed
[30:21] right pull up back up brother Anderson
[30:25] Revelations where would you read
[30:31] look back to where he was reading
[30:33] Revelations
[30:34] this picture
[30:38] and when he had opened the fifth seal I
[30:40] saw one of the altar that sold of them
[30:42] that were slain for the word of God and
[30:44] for the testimony which they hailed
[30:45] we'll get to know
[30:47] and they cry for a loud voice saying how
[30:50] long
[30:51] oh Lord holy and true just thou not
[30:53] judging them into our blood on them that
[30:55] dwell on the earth we'll get to that
[30:56] part later too
[30:58] and white roads were given unto every
[31:00] one of them
[31:06] they're killed in the church ages right
[31:09] with the white robes not in the church
[31:11] yet
[31:14] so the fifth seal is not fully revealed
[31:16] until after we get out of here
[31:18] even what's making manifest on Earth and
[31:21] white roads were given unto every one of
[31:22] them and it was said unto them that they
[31:25] should rest for a little cease yet for a
[31:27] little season until their fellow
[31:29] servants also and their Brethren that
[31:32] should be killed as they were
[31:35] should be full of him
[31:39] that's 144 000.
[31:42] right
[31:43] the 144 000 they're the one is to be
[31:46] killed
[31:48] see when we get out of here or something
[31:50] else is going to take place
[31:57] they're going to receive white Rogue
[32:05] all right we'll get back to that it
[32:06] might be a little contrary to some of
[32:08] our thinking
[32:11] but I just want to
[32:12] get that point
[32:15] no combat Beast
[32:18] because the mystery of the Antichrist
[32:22] also the mystery of Jesus Christ him the
[32:26] bride has been fulfilled at the time
[32:31] that we begin to talk about
[32:35] see the mystery of the church is
[32:37] finished
[32:38] at this time of the fifth seal right
[32:40] whom we just read
[32:45] so now no matter if what you think about
[32:47] it
[32:52] leave the prophets right
[32:54] because this don't take place in the
[32:57] church ages
[33:00] this is after the church ages we just
[33:03] feel seal comes into finality
[33:06] but the people of it
[33:09] started being killed at Calvary right
[33:12] after them
[33:14] the real true Jew now I want to keep
[33:16] pounding that to you not every Jew right
[33:23] but around the emphasize Not That Wall
[33:25] Street bunch is after money and stuff
[33:27] right
[33:29] he's talking about they're not even in
[33:31] the 144 thousand right
[33:35] because out of Israel the whole nation
[33:37] is only 144 000 out of Millions
[33:41] that are there right now
[33:43] is going to be saved in that Park amen
[33:49] so then separated it's not the bride
[33:52] it's not 144 000. it's Israel to be
[33:56] saved as a nation
[33:58] of the promises God gave her
[34:01] now
[34:03] so that starts to unfold
[34:09] look at number two now on you
[34:12] notes Brother Anderson
[34:15] this is paragraph 87.
[34:23] on the fifth seal but the reason that he
[34:25] reveals that I I as I understand
[34:29] it is because the mystery of the book of
[34:31] redemption as far as the Antichrist
[34:32] being revealed and at the same time the
[34:35] church is gone and these things don't
[34:37] even happen in the church age at all
[34:41] mushy that's right they're away from the
[34:44] church you need the church absolutely is
[34:46] raptured at this time the church goes up
[34:48] in the fourth chapter of Revelation and
[34:50] does not return until it comes back with
[34:52] his King in 19th Chapter but these seals
[34:54] here are revealing what has been what is
[34:58] and what will be
[35:02] now what would it be for the church age
[35:05] was revealed by these seals and now
[35:07] watch what hey
[35:09] did
[35:11] all right
[35:13] can we go back and we look at the seals
[35:16] and we see that
[35:17] even one two three and four is after we
[35:20] get out of here
[35:22] but they started back under
[35:27] right they've started in Genesis the
[35:30] prophet says
[35:32] it works his way all the way down
[35:33] through
[35:35] all right
[35:36] he said one seal will tie the entire
[35:39] Bible together
[35:41] now he didn't say you had to pick which
[35:42] one right
[35:44] any of them right
[35:47] right I've asked you before you know
[35:49] what is the the seal that's most
[35:51] important to you and people who say oh
[35:53] the seventh
[35:55] you know what I've always said
[35:57] if you don't see the first
[36:00] you don't know what the seventh is Right
[36:02] amen all right
[36:05] so the first seal was a very important
[36:07] important one to me amen
[36:09] amen and I told you when I preached a
[36:11] few weeks ago a month ago or something
[36:13] I didn't connect together the second
[36:15] third and even the fourth in the The
[36:19] Importance part
[36:22] and like it was until the Lord revealed
[36:24] it to me
[36:26] on one seal the tie the entire Bible
[36:28] together because one seal is the
[36:30] revelation of Jesus Christ right amen
[36:33] the Bible is a revelation of Jesus
[36:35] Christ
[36:38] that's why we keep reading in Revelation
[36:39] 1.
[36:42] the Revelation that God give to Jesus to
[36:44] give to John not trinitarianism
[36:49] the message of one true and living God
[36:52] you may make known to you and I in this
[36:54] end time
[36:55] and only to that can you understand the
[36:58] seals and things
[37:00] people come in and all that grab and see
[37:02] a book they read it they know all about
[37:03] to see them
[37:07] I told you what I done I read the seal
[37:09] book after being in the message probably
[37:11] three four five six months
[37:15] and I laid it aside and went back to the
[37:17] church age book
[37:19] because I couldn't get a full
[37:22] comprehension of what he was studying
[37:26] but then one day I begin to
[37:29] come back through and start it on the
[37:31] seals
[37:32] all right
[37:33] but now listen
[37:36] the seals reveal what has been what is
[37:39] and what will be
[37:40] that's Hebrews 13 8 right Jesus Christ
[37:43] was saying yesterday today and forever
[37:45] all right so the CEO starting back you
[37:47] under work their way down
[37:49] that's what I was trying to illustrate
[37:51] with the fifth seal
[37:55] that those Souls under the altar are
[37:58] actually killed during the church ages
[38:05] the time of Calvary to where we are
[38:09] but yet that seal was not fully revealed
[38:13] go to some more things about it
[38:17] amen so the prophet's right when he says
[38:20] the church is gone and isn't even past
[38:22] our time
[38:25] until we get the revelation of it
[38:29] look what he says on this one go ahead
[38:31] number three
[38:36] look what he was saying
[38:40] Gabriel's instruction to Daniel
[38:43] 1961 7 30 in the morning service
[38:46] paragraph 50. and the third chapter of
[38:49] the church was gone up
[38:52] but now Redemption is to be revealed and
[38:54] watch
[38:55] how the church was redeemed
[39:00] all right
[39:01] the revelation of what's taking place
[39:03] during the church age
[39:07] must be revealed to us The Plan of
[39:09] Redemption through the Church of you see
[39:11] the church is gone
[39:13] one after the third chapter
[39:15] so he is now showing in the fifth
[39:18] chapter
[39:21] remember we put service after service in
[39:24] the fifth chapter of Revelation
[39:27] right
[39:30] look what he says now he's showing in
[39:32] the field chapter how he did it
[39:36] what taken place
[39:39] I sealed the church off
[39:42] you remember we kept emphasizing the
[39:45] prophet said enough
[39:48] that the the fifth chapter
[39:51] was a saying for the opening of the
[39:53] seals
[39:55] you remember that
[39:57] that's right need to back up and listen
[39:59] Maybe
[40:01] the fifth chapter
[40:04] how he did it
[40:07] why can't complaints I ain't sealed at
[40:09] church y'all how did he feel the church
[40:11] y'all the revelation of his name water
[40:13] baptism using his name eternal life no
[40:16] eternal hell serpent seed eternal
[40:18] security all the great doctrines
[40:20] predestination of the church that was
[40:22] revealed to the church he's showing how
[40:24] he done it yep
[40:27] right
[40:29] he said but that was before the seals
[40:31] broke
[40:32] sure nothing was a prophet
[40:35] before the seal broke
[40:38] that's right
[40:40] so what takes place now
[40:43] moving number four
[40:47] the Feast of the trumpets preached in
[40:49] 1964 719 the morning series paragraph 36
[40:52] 37. the first three chapters of the Book
[40:55] of Revelation revealed all the
[40:56] happenings of the church then for the
[40:59] third chapter into the 19th Chapter
[41:00] there is no more seen of the church NATO
[41:04] bride right
[41:06] the church goes up at the fourth chapter
[41:08] of Revelation returned back to the 19th
[41:10] Chapter of Revelation the bridegroom
[41:12] together coming into into coming to the
[41:15] Earth and therefore the 19th Chapter on
[41:17] this concludes you've been to the
[41:18] Millennium and the things four to 19 is
[41:22] to Israel all right now
[41:27] and I said I spent 40 years trying to
[41:29] explain that
[41:33] that we do not go into where the seals
[41:37] are broke out
[41:38] because they're broke to Israel
[41:43] even though we are here at the time of
[41:47] Israel being as a nation sealed away in
[41:51] God
[41:52] we are not at the time when they receive
[41:55] their white robes right amen
[42:04] what did he say what did we keep giving
[42:06] number five we give this this quote a
[42:08] lot
[42:10] poor seal night paragraph 194.
[42:13] what Roger pale horses he appeared on
[42:15] his Riders Last Ride he's on his life
[42:18] now
[42:18] now this is not in our day
[42:21] that will be on down
[42:24] it's the seal foretold because see the
[42:27] church has done gone up when this
[42:29] happens
[42:31] all right
[42:33] when they get their white robes
[42:39] go ahead with number six because we're
[42:40] gonna be back on that same scripture
[42:46] but the emphasis on like verse 11 and
[42:48] white roads were given unto every one of
[42:50] them and it was said unto them that they
[42:53] should rest yet for a little season
[42:55] until their fellow servants also and
[42:58] their Brethren should get killed as they
[43:00] were should be fulfilled
[43:02] they're giving white robes
[43:07] before Israel is sealed as 144 thousand
[43:12] but the Bible says
[43:17] when I said there's a mystery to this
[43:19] seal
[43:23] it's a great mystery
[43:25] and why God would do it
[43:28] now you remember
[43:32] we got them there
[43:34] you remember the fifth chapter as it
[43:37] said
[43:39] in that fifth chapter
[43:41] but around said it was a scene
[43:45] in the opening of The Seven Seals
[43:48] and we're done gone right
[43:51] you didn't think of that
[43:54] it's a saying he says but we're done God
[44:01] see but we see it
[44:03] that's the scene
[44:05] we see ourselves already in glory in the
[44:09] fifth chapter remember they asked him a
[44:11] question about it he answered the
[44:13] question that all that was that was not
[44:15] the bride and then the Lord corrected
[44:16] him and he answered it back and he said
[44:18] that was the Bride of Jesus Christ
[44:22] unless anybody would like the other
[44:23] paragraph 270 through 274 uh questions
[44:28] and answers on the seals trying to cut
[44:30] down a little bit
[44:34] pull up to number nine now let's start
[44:36] on something we're going to read quite a
[44:38] bit right here
[44:45] and this will be a continual reading
[44:48] for a little bit starting to paragraph
[44:51] 215 and it will go down through
[44:54] paragraph
[44:59] what
[45:06] I'll get to it in a minute I'm going to
[45:08] turn place your stomach where I'm at
[45:11] I'm in here somewhere
[45:13] so we're going to start at 2 15 and
[45:15] we're going to wind up at 228
[45:18] so that way you can't argue what profit
[45:20] says or not
[45:22] all right
[45:23] paragraph 215. now notice in the ninth
[45:25] verse children under the altar now
[45:28] here's where I'm going to get some real
[45:30] disagreement now you're going to read in
[45:32] your other book and say disagreeing
[45:35] see but this is the upgraded translation
[45:37] I mean that's a very good point
[45:39] just watch just a minute just see I
[45:42] thought that too
[45:44] much
[45:47] I thought that too
[45:49] but it didn't come that way
[45:50] we've I've always thought that these
[45:53] Souls under the altar were the the
[45:55] martyrs of the early church
[45:58] is what he said he thought it was
[46:00] I'm sure that Dr urach Smith and every
[46:03] one of them says it is see but I thought
[46:06] so myself but when the Holy Spirit
[46:09] showed the vision to it
[46:12] are you listening
[46:15] it wasn't
[46:17] it isn't the soul so we saw a vision
[46:19] about the fifth seal
[46:23] that's what he said
[46:25] now you now you say well I I don't know
[46:29] about that well now in just a minute
[46:31] we'll find out so these are not The
[46:34] Souls of the of the Bride church not at
[46:37] all we thought that was the right church
[46:41] wedding that our souls under the altar
[46:43] you see crying how long how long
[46:46] let me read it again now shall we get to
[46:49] it so he goes to the fifth seal reading
[46:51] it and then he comes down and what does
[46:53] he say
[46:54] now for they at for a day at this time
[46:57] if you notice this feels still being
[47:00] open see
[47:01] the church is gone
[47:03] through the bride's gone right
[47:05] it just can't beat it Souls under the
[47:07] yard the early church
[47:10] now now please if if you ever did give
[47:13] this attention now because this is a
[47:16] great controversy so I want you to
[47:18] listen real close now you've got your
[47:20] papers and things to write down now and
[47:22] I want you to notice
[47:23] now these cannot be them Souls because
[47:26] the souls of the righteous modern and
[47:29] righteous people the church the bride
[47:31] has done been took up so they wouldn't
[47:34] be under the altar they'd be in glory
[47:37] with the with the bride now watch for
[47:40] they are gone and the Rapture in the
[47:42] fourth chapter of Revelation that was
[47:46] taken up now you see why that it's so
[47:49] important for me to keep driving that
[47:51] down
[47:53] to get your mind one day to where the
[47:56] Holy Spirit can quick and what he's
[47:58] really saved
[48:01] yes but brother so-and-so said it I
[48:03] don't care
[48:05] what he said
[48:11] I don't care what anybody says
[48:15] it's what the prophet had to say
[48:17] that's right we had a meeting first time
[48:19] we run into brother whibley and brother
[48:21] Richard and him we went up to pick up
[48:22] brother Fred Barker and they had a
[48:24] meeting and they were going to have one
[48:26] a week later we went back
[48:28] and met these brothers and when we got
[48:30] there we started talking of something on
[48:33] the seals and and the things and and one
[48:37] of the brothers he said well brother
[48:38] so-and-so said the two witnesses is not
[48:41] going to be killed in 144 000 is not
[48:43] going to be killed
[48:46] don't worry Brothers being
[48:49] yeah I said anybody got a seal block
[48:53] well they produced a seal book
[48:55] but I produced the pages
[48:59] where the Prophet said the two witnesses
[49:01] would be killed and 144 000 to be killed
[49:04] and I said now let's turn in the Bible
[49:08] yeah
[49:10] then we got into the Bible where it says
[49:12] they were to be killed
[49:14] and I said now who are you going to
[49:15] listen to
[49:17] but brother so-and-so told it that way I
[49:20] said I don't care
[49:22] it ain't in the message
[49:26] did he do any good no
[49:29] you're going to get the same point
[49:31] do they better have our so-and-so said
[49:33] than that what the Bible says
[49:36] if that's the way you are out there on
[49:38] the Internet or anybody sitting here
[49:39] then you might as well pack it but he
[49:41] does and go home because we ain't gonna
[49:43] change around here
[49:45] good we don't know who the prophet is
[49:48] and what he came to do and we've got his
[49:51] message
[49:53] you go play around the Foreign Fields
[49:55] where you can't where they don't have a
[49:56] bunch of prophet is talking about
[49:59] because that's what they've done
[50:01] flooded those places with their
[50:04] doctrines
[50:05] listen
[50:10] now who are these Souls then
[50:14] see that's the next thing who are they
[50:16] if they are not near a church and watch
[50:19] what he said this is Israel that's to be
[50:22] saved as a nation
[50:25] all of them that are predestinated
[50:28] that's Israel itself you said oh wait a
[50:31] minute you say they came oh yes they are
[50:34] to be saved here let's just settle in a
[50:37] minute I got four or five scriptures
[50:39] I'll take one let's take Romans just a
[50:41] minute and find out if they are and
[50:44] state in the Book of Romans and go to
[50:46] the Limit chapter Romans will find out
[50:48] just let's just read it then we'll have
[50:51] it by herself
[50:53] Romans the 11th chapter the 25th 26th
[50:56] verse now listen Paul here and Paul said
[50:59] if anyone else even an angel preached
[51:02] any other gospel and what he was then
[51:06] what he was to be cursed what
[51:10] I would not Brethren that you should be
[51:12] ignorant of the mystery
[51:15] unless you should be wise in your own
[51:17] conceits
[51:19] there you are
[51:20] the blindness in part is happening to
[51:23] Israel until it's fulfilling
[51:26] fullness of the Gentiles become in
[51:30] all right now
[51:33] blindness to Israel
[51:39] now let me State what I've said over and
[51:41] over
[51:43] you probably said this is Israel as a
[51:45] nation
[51:47] he says not the 144 000 that he's
[51:50] speaking of
[51:54] they will be sealed after we leave out
[51:56] of here
[51:59] these have given their life for the
[52:01] gospel down Through the Ages
[52:05] the testimony that they held
[52:09] for the word of God that they believed
[52:12] this is not ever Jew
[52:15] no more than ever Gentile will be saved
[52:20] this is the predestinated chosen of
[52:23] Israel
[52:27] he said well no
[52:32] did they hear the gospel
[52:36] not necessarily because we're going to
[52:38] read in a minute we're going around and
[52:40] said they stayed with the law
[52:47] and the round said when they landed
[52:49] those airplanes over there the people
[52:50] said
[52:51] those priests you know told them said
[52:53] you're going to fly home on the wings of
[52:54] an eagle
[52:56] he said they've been back up in them
[52:58] countries up there plowing with an old
[53:00] wooden plow
[53:03] now there's really is wrong
[53:10] now watch
[53:16] okay
[53:18] so we get to a point
[53:24] to think on something
[53:28] blindness
[53:32] now
[53:36] to me there's a lot of things that we've
[53:38] got to be considered on that because if
[53:40] you go one way you're going off you go
[53:41] the other way you're going off
[53:43] you keep running it
[53:46] you're going out on a limb either way
[53:49] you go
[53:50] unless you follow the complete channel
[53:52] right through the middle
[53:54] all right
[53:56] if I'm wrong on the if I'm up for
[53:58] correction
[54:02] but what does it mean blindness in part
[54:07] Paul speaking over in the other gospel
[54:09] talks about
[54:12] to this day
[54:16] Israel
[54:18] can't see
[54:21] the truth
[54:24] but because of their heart
[54:29] all right
[54:32] and if they can't see then
[54:36] they must be blind
[54:40] now we're not talking about willful
[54:43] ignorance or blindness
[54:49] you know the foolish version
[54:53] as an example
[54:56] a lot of those people are blinded that
[54:59] if it's even heard the truth
[55:04] I'm trying to give you an example and
[55:06] show what you'll think about it
[55:08] the fullest version is blinded to the
[55:10] truth
[55:13] they can't see what you're talking about
[55:16] because they're
[55:18] Pharisees or Sadducees priests preachers
[55:21] you know
[55:22] has blinded their eyes
[55:25] and you know the Bible said that God
[55:27] would wink at her ignorance
[55:31] but now if you turn down the truth
[55:34] yeah
[55:35] as a gentile you have no hopes
[55:37] whatsoever
[55:40] because you don't get a second change
[55:43] and I want you to get that out of your
[55:45] mind in a hurry
[55:48] that Israel is not dealing God is not
[55:50] dealing with a set of change
[55:53] he's doing exactly what he said he was
[55:57] going to do right amen
[55:59] he's not giving Israel a second chance
[56:02] that's Catholicism
[56:05] we don't make it here maybe we'll make
[56:07] it there
[56:08] that's Catholicism
[56:10] God told us what he was going to do and
[56:13] he done it that's right
[56:17] he blinded his people
[56:21] he said now the religious leaders this
[56:24] those guys are not not the part I'm
[56:26] talking about how they assumed you the
[56:28] religious leaders
[56:29] they blinded themselves to the truth
[56:37] when they were standing there saying if
[56:39] any blood be on us that was probably
[56:41] real good people that haven't even
[56:42] become a to be Soldier under the altar
[56:45] you may be there that day
[56:48] but they were blinded by the false
[56:51] Shepherds just like your foolish virgin
[56:54] brought around and said is what
[56:56] those who never heard the message
[57:01] right or those who were blinded
[57:05] by the false Shepherds
[57:08] and they're foolish virgins and they'll
[57:09] be giving eternal life one day
[57:14] huh
[57:16] well you already got an example to see
[57:19] we're not talking about the the
[57:21] religious leaders that was calling that
[57:23] we're talking about the people that got
[57:25] caught up in that
[57:30] I was telling brother Donnie about it
[57:32] you go down here to Walmart
[57:34] go outside of Walmart
[57:38] and you get your microphone and you
[57:40] start saying
[57:42] they're selling stuff in this place it
[57:44] ain't good
[57:45] you're not even shopping here you want
[57:49] to leave
[57:49] not buy nothing in Walmart anymore you
[57:52] know what you don't gather a crowd
[57:54] right right you know what the crowd's
[57:57] going to be doing and maybe some guy
[57:59] comes up never been in Walmart
[58:04] we ain't going into Walmart
[58:07] because they got plenty of not kill us
[58:09] you draw a crown
[58:13] that's what's in religious leaders done
[58:16] right they draw the crowd
[58:19] and those four old people didn't have
[58:21] the bad kids from the Holy Ghost to know
[58:23] the difference you don't find any of the
[58:26] Apostles standing in that crowd
[58:31] come on because they knew the difference
[58:36] right they were already pre-programmed
[58:41] to know the truth even though they were
[58:44] running and hiding they were not in the
[58:46] crowd flying out for his blood
[58:52] the church if you don't get nothing out
[58:54] of this message tonight you get one
[58:55] thing
[59:01] Israel
[59:03] is the root and offspring of God
[59:08] you and I are grafted in
[59:12] right and then yes we're the bride of
[59:15] Christ the most wonderful of all sure we
[59:17] have accepted Jesus Christ and Israel
[59:19] has turned her down but Israel is the
[59:22] foundation
[59:25] that was God's Nation
[59:29] chosen out of all of the Nations of the
[59:32] world he chose a nation
[59:34] because in dealing with Israel you don't
[59:37] deal with individuals you deal as a
[59:39] nation
[59:43] sure there was a lot of problems in it
[59:47] but just remember one thing
[59:51] even in who was it Balaam trying to
[59:54] curse Israel he got back and looked and
[59:56] saw the hinder Parts the worst things
[59:58] that could be happening in Israel and he
[1:00:00] said I can't see it
[1:00:05] then he said all I can see is a
[1:00:08] atonement that's being made
[1:00:12] right
[1:00:16] but get what I'm saying now so don't
[1:00:18] misunderstand me
[1:00:20] blindness
[1:00:23] when you're willfully blinded that's
[1:00:25] you're sealed away in doomed
[1:00:29] and there are a lot of Jews
[1:00:31] that were willfully blinded
[1:00:36] and they have a place called hell to go
[1:00:38] to
[1:00:42] but there's a chosen predestinated group
[1:00:44] amen of Israel
[1:00:48] and I emphasize chosen predestinated we
[1:00:51] want to go through Chosen and
[1:00:52] predestinated enough Gentiles were
[1:00:54] called in predestination right right why
[1:00:56] don't you read the book girl we're
[1:00:58] Paul's speaking of predestination and
[1:01:00] see if he ain't talking about Israel
[1:01:01] just as well as he talking about us
[1:01:04] right
[1:01:07] when you're willfully blinded you're
[1:01:09] lost
[1:01:11] when you know the truth and won't follow
[1:01:13] it that's the first seal of iniquity be
[1:01:15] that North to do good and won't do it
[1:01:17] right
[1:01:21] that's where the problem of the people
[1:01:23] of the message they know better than to
[1:01:24] come up with all this garbage that
[1:01:26] they're doing now that brother random
[1:01:28] was wrong and this and that and the
[1:01:29] other
[1:01:31] they're blaspheming the Holy Ghost
[1:01:33] whether you like those words or not
[1:01:35] right
[1:01:38] brother Dave I've heard you say some
[1:01:39] things about people you talk about I'm
[1:01:41] talking about you me or anybody that is
[1:01:45] contrary to the word of God and we know
[1:01:47] better and won't call her after it
[1:01:49] we become willfully ignorant blinded
[1:01:53] blaspheming the Holy Ghost
[1:01:56] because remember
[1:01:58] you can't blaspheme the Holy Ghost if
[1:02:00] you had it right
[1:02:04] right
[1:02:06] you can't
[1:02:07] Holy Ghost if you have the Holy Ghost
[1:02:10] quotes
[1:02:13] it's impossible Paul's explaining for
[1:02:16] you to fall away if you are sealed in by
[1:02:18] the kingdom of God by the new birth you
[1:02:21] can't fall away he's not explaining how
[1:02:23] to fall away he's explaining you can't
[1:02:25] fall away
[1:02:29] he said that's Baptist Doctrine nope
[1:02:32] that ain't once saved always saved
[1:02:35] that's what's truly Born Again always
[1:02:37] born again
[1:02:40] now get my point and say maybe we can
[1:02:42] continue a thought
[1:02:48] we turn down this word we are blinded to
[1:02:50] the word
[1:02:53] and we have no hope whatsoever
[1:02:58] because we're not Israel
[1:03:01] Israel was God's chosen Nation amen
[1:03:06] I like what that Rabbi Richmond said he
[1:03:08] said I can't help it if God chose us and
[1:03:11] I rejoice when you sit down
[1:03:15] even though the man
[1:03:17] you know I don't know what he'll be what
[1:03:19] he can be or whatever could be out of
[1:03:20] him or what he might be lost and dying
[1:03:22] go to hell we throw the truth
[1:03:28] God keep the nation
[1:03:31] and spent
[1:03:34] 4
[1:03:35] 000 years
[1:03:38] dealing with that Nation you know what
[1:03:41] I'm talking about it didn't start until
[1:03:43] over in Abraham and they're coming on
[1:03:45] down come on get the story but it's 2
[1:03:47] 000 years of it
[1:03:49] this God's chosen people right right
[1:03:53] when he said Abraham you and your seat
[1:03:55] after you
[1:03:56] are going to be in an Everlasting
[1:03:58] Covenant
[1:04:00] who was the seat of Abraham Israel
[1:04:04] right
[1:04:09] and Paul says that their their hearts
[1:04:12] are blinded to the truth
[1:04:14] when he said one day it will come off
[1:04:16] the veil or come off their eyes
[1:04:18] and they'll be able to see
[1:04:24] I've got this at the end of the message
[1:04:29] I think it's a good place to put it
[1:04:33] when that 144 thousand
[1:04:38] they see they have rejected their
[1:04:40] Messiah through the two witnesses right
[1:04:44] and they'll Realize by their preaching
[1:04:46] that they have turned down the gospel
[1:04:51] true
[1:04:53] and then weep and pull apart
[1:04:56] because they realize they themselves
[1:05:01] of the body of Israel had turned against
[1:05:04] God and crucified him
[1:05:10] but what about when they come up and see
[1:05:13] what if God slips a little secret to
[1:05:16] that hundred and forty four thousand
[1:05:20] and after you get out of here
[1:05:23] I'm going to show you something
[1:05:28] I want to show you my grace
[1:05:32] I'm going to show you my grace to Israel
[1:05:35] as a fallen race a nation
[1:05:39] no wonder they shout and cry in rejoice
[1:05:42] because they see not only their
[1:05:44] salvation
[1:05:45] if they see the opening their seals come
[1:05:48] on
[1:05:48] note the opening of the seal show the
[1:05:51] Israel's Redemption all right come on
[1:05:53] then they'll not be preached like they
[1:05:55] don't have to preach one Co two Co three
[1:05:57] simple not but they tell them the story
[1:06:00] they'll see
[1:06:02] that God did blind their people
[1:06:06] but your eyes are going to come open
[1:06:11] amen
[1:06:13] white robes
[1:06:14] amen amen that's right
[1:06:18] they'll see that they've been killed
[1:06:20] down through there
[1:06:21] martyred by the Millions
[1:06:25] but they'll see also
[1:06:27] if you're going to be giving eternal
[1:06:28] life
[1:06:34] don't you think that'd make a good old
[1:06:36] Jew a 144
[1:06:38] man to realize he's done missed it but
[1:06:40] he's our and he's got salvation and it's
[1:06:42] going to happen the seals are opening to
[1:06:43] him and he sees God like it is but then
[1:06:45] he also sees
[1:06:47] that God didn't leave Israel out of this
[1:06:51] right that's right
[1:06:54] he didn't annihilate Israel because of
[1:06:56] what they were doing
[1:06:58] because they were blinded
[1:07:04] and here's the part that a lot of people
[1:07:06] wouldn't agree with
[1:07:08] God blinded
[1:07:12] amen I don't covered it now so you'll
[1:07:15] take the point right
[1:07:16] right I'm not talking about
[1:07:19] Wall Street Jews I'm not talking about
[1:07:21] every Jew I'm not talking about the
[1:07:22] priest and those guys that were there
[1:07:25] hollering for his blood they blinded
[1:07:27] themselves right
[1:07:30] but when they blinded themselves
[1:07:34] just that it is in the Gentile
[1:07:36] dispensation those who heard the message
[1:07:39] those who didn't hear the message the
[1:07:41] prophet said foolish virgin he said and
[1:07:43] the ones who heard the message but were
[1:07:46] blinded by the false Shepherds
[1:07:48] they are foolish virgins to be given
[1:07:51] eternal life
[1:07:55] I'm not talking about all Israel
[1:07:58] I've laid it out in order of what I'm
[1:08:00] saying
[1:08:05] God blinded his own people
[1:08:08] the scripture said blindness in part
[1:08:11] why does it say in part
[1:08:14] because one day that part's going to be
[1:08:16] taken away
[1:08:20] the part that's blinding them is going
[1:08:21] to be taken away
[1:08:25] you say well I I can see how that that
[1:08:27] they were you know these people blind
[1:08:30] I'm not talking about the people who saw
[1:08:32] the truth and blinded their own eyes
[1:08:35] right now
[1:08:36] I've done been over that a dozen times
[1:08:42] I'm talking about the real true Israel
[1:08:45] as a nation of God
[1:08:48] that has been martyred down to the ages
[1:08:51] for their testimony
[1:08:53] and you better get it right now the word
[1:08:56] of God
[1:08:59] right
[1:09:00] and their testimony
[1:09:03] yeah but I just can't see how Israel's
[1:09:06] got a word of God
[1:09:10] the Bible says it
[1:09:12] the prophet said it
[1:09:14] what are you gonna do with it
[1:09:19] if you see the truth and turn it down
[1:09:21] you're lost
[1:09:23] if a Jew sees the truth and turns it
[1:09:26] down he's lost
[1:09:29] but what about those who've never heard
[1:09:31] nothing right
[1:09:36] come on
[1:09:37] those who've never heard anything about
[1:09:39] Jesus Christ
[1:09:42] no nothing but the law
[1:09:45] and they've lived it to the letter
[1:09:49] go to their home at a meeting at times
[1:09:52] and they got everything so laid out in
[1:09:54] perfect order
[1:09:55] even to a place left there for Elijah
[1:09:58] to come right
[1:10:01] that's right because they know that
[1:10:04] Elijah will proceed to coming beside
[1:10:06] amen absolutely
[1:10:11] at Reuben when we go down to Israel that
[1:10:13] thrilled me to hear what the man had to
[1:10:15] say
[1:10:15] and what George and them said he said he
[1:10:17] said I believe that this was Elijah
[1:10:20] talking about brother Brown
[1:10:22] because they know that Elijah is going
[1:10:24] to come
[1:10:27] we know that's going to be
[1:10:29] Elijah and Moses
[1:10:32] they think Elijah is going to come and
[1:10:34] the Messiah right right will be right
[1:10:36] there
[1:10:38] what I told Reuben I said Reuben you're
[1:10:41] looking for the Messiah to come we
[1:10:42] believe Jesus was a messiah and that
[1:10:44] Messiah told us
[1:10:46] if we laid hand over sick you remember
[1:10:48] he was bitching and off I said you mind
[1:10:51] if me and Brother Dean here pray for you
[1:10:53] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ the
[1:10:56] one we believe he said no sir I want you
[1:10:59] to you know what God healed him but the
[1:11:01] next morning I said how you doing Reuben
[1:11:02] he said wonderful
[1:11:06] now he's going to have problems
[1:11:08] he's going to have trouble trying to
[1:11:10] qualify in this group of people he
[1:11:13] better hope that he lives it long enough
[1:11:15] to make 144th house because he might get
[1:11:18] a shake because as much truth as he
[1:11:20] knows
[1:11:22] a man could quote the Bible ten times
[1:11:24] better than I can
[1:11:26] tell you everything about where this was
[1:11:29] and where Jesus walked and everything he
[1:11:31] said Sam I'm not going to show you
[1:11:32] nothing that I don't know personally
[1:11:34] that this is where Jesus walked and what
[1:11:36] he done we did not go to the Via
[1:11:39] Dolorosa that everybody wants to walk on
[1:11:41] he said because he's about three places
[1:11:42] and they don't know where exactly
[1:11:45] what was the mouse Placentia or
[1:11:47] something he said they got so many
[1:11:49] places that we don't know
[1:11:50] he said I'm not going to take if I don't
[1:11:52] know
[1:11:54] I know you're a vulnerable man
[1:11:57] maybe God will help you one of these
[1:11:58] days
[1:12:00] but listen Church
[1:12:05] go ahead with
[1:12:09] go ahead with murder number nine we're
[1:12:11] still on there
[1:12:12] I'm like I'll have to make sure we try
[1:12:14] to keep up with paragraph 225. the last
[1:12:17] Gentile brought to be brought in is in
[1:12:19] for the bride the blind has come to
[1:12:22] Israel for that purpose see for us to be
[1:12:24] Romanian you realize that he hadn't
[1:12:26] blinded Israel you and I wouldn't be
[1:12:28] saved
[1:12:29] now I'm talking about blinded whether
[1:12:31] you believe he blinded them deliberately
[1:12:33] or what he done I believe he did
[1:12:37] you and I wouldn't have come in
[1:12:39] I ain't talking about all the Israel and
[1:12:42] all the junk and the people that hear
[1:12:43] the truth
[1:12:44] those that blind their own selves I'm
[1:12:47] talking about a group of people
[1:12:49] sealed Jew
[1:12:52] is blinded
[1:12:55] now listen
[1:12:58] for a minute
[1:13:01] those people that were crying out for
[1:13:03] his blood those Pharisees and all that
[1:13:05] was arguing with him all the time down
[1:13:06] through there
[1:13:09] even gamaya
[1:13:11] and Nicodemus was never in the bride
[1:13:15] brother Brown said they could be given
[1:13:17] eternal life one to one or the other
[1:13:18] some be given eternal life for their
[1:13:20] stand
[1:13:21] all right
[1:13:23] right but don't tell me I'm not talking
[1:13:26] about them people that was the Pharisees
[1:13:28] the the the religious leaders
[1:13:33] none of them ever come in to be the
[1:13:35] bride of Christ
[1:13:39] now I'm not saying nobody couldn't get
[1:13:41] the idea so you get women you're trying
[1:13:43] to try to trap by this word and then you
[1:13:45] turn off the tape and say well I don't
[1:13:47] believe what he said
[1:13:48] some of those people could have received
[1:13:50] eternal life
[1:13:52] they stay in my opinions
[1:13:53] I'm not talking
[1:13:57] turn down God
[1:13:59] and they're going to be doomed for that
[1:14:01] turning down I'm talking about a people
[1:14:03] that was blinded
[1:14:06] that God himself blinded he put his hand
[1:14:09] over their eyes that they couldn't see
[1:14:11] that you and I could be saved if he
[1:14:14] hadn't done it we wouldn't be saved
[1:14:16] whatever you want to argue about the
[1:14:18] blindness just remember if blindness had
[1:14:20] to come to Israel you wouldn't be saved
[1:14:22] that's right
[1:14:28] shall be saved as it is written
[1:14:33] yes that's a scripture
[1:14:38] well no no that says all at that
[1:14:46] they said all Israel
[1:14:48] all said is
[1:14:51] not all Israel is Israel right
[1:14:54] how do you say that but not all Jews are
[1:14:57] Jews
[1:14:58] right
[1:14:59] you know how our Israel all you want to
[1:15:02] that don't mean anything at all we are
[1:15:04] the Israel of God
[1:15:06] we're the bride of Christ all right so
[1:15:08] all Israel shall be saved as written
[1:15:11] now he's quoting Old Testament scripture
[1:15:13] he'll come out of time or deliver
[1:15:16] and shall turn away ungodliness for
[1:15:19] Jacob
[1:15:23] now there's two scriptures there you
[1:15:25] need to consider and ain't got time
[1:15:27] one of them says al-azine
[1:15:30] comes to deliver
[1:15:33] you know where Israel's deliverer comes
[1:15:35] from
[1:15:36] from you and I
[1:15:38] whether you like that or not
[1:15:41] it comes from you and I out of Zion we
[1:15:45] are Zion out of the Bride come to
[1:15:47] deliver
[1:15:48] the other one says two design or
[1:15:50] something like that come to deliver
[1:15:53] you better get in your scripture to
[1:15:55] write now they are Israel
[1:15:58] that's under the this altar
[1:16:00] watch Israel was blinded for the very
[1:16:02] purpose of us being saved
[1:16:05] you believe that now Who blinded them
[1:16:07] God God blinded his own children
[1:16:11] that you're not going to be saved for
[1:16:12] that no wonder Jesus without standing at
[1:16:15] the cross
[1:16:16] an infused howling for his blood
[1:16:19] that was his own kids
[1:16:23] and he was the scripture
[1:16:26] he was himself the word
[1:16:28] and he
[1:16:30] knowing that those people
[1:16:32] what would have gladly received him
[1:16:36] now you're going to read your prophet
[1:16:41] knowing that those people would have
[1:16:43] gladly received him
[1:16:45] now why did he say that he couldn't go
[1:16:46] to Israel with his doctor I mean with
[1:16:49] his gift
[1:16:53] Israel right but he couldn't go
[1:16:56] that's right my iniquity I mean that's
[1:16:58] not full yet
[1:17:00] you leave this message and go driver
[1:17:02] won't be running around standing over
[1:17:03] there knowing that those people would
[1:17:05] have gladly received him and that's the
[1:17:08] reason he blinded them
[1:17:10] it's originally blinded him
[1:17:13] so they wouldn't recognize him
[1:17:16] can you come and shut your humble way
[1:17:18] and blinded them to it
[1:17:21] that they wouldn't receive it see the
[1:17:25] scripture said
[1:17:26] they would do it and he grabbed it
[1:17:30] all right
[1:17:31] and he glided what's blind Jesus
[1:17:36] said Jesus pitted once them even so much
[1:17:41] as he said father forgive them
[1:17:43] they don't know what they're doing
[1:17:46] they were blind Paul said they were
[1:17:48] blind for a cause for us
[1:17:52] but just remember one time
[1:17:55] Jesus said lay this not to their charge
[1:18:00] now he wasn't talking about them guys
[1:18:03] that started the stories and got
[1:18:05] everything messed up right
[1:18:06] it was late to their charge
[1:18:09] I'm talking about the Pharisees and
[1:18:11] Sadducees that was trying to trap him he
[1:18:14] wasn't talking about them he was talking
[1:18:16] about his little chosen people his
[1:18:19] little bride
[1:18:20] you know as we'd call it we know they
[1:18:23] didn't turn out to be right it won't
[1:18:24] turn out to be right they rejected the
[1:18:26] bride we are the bride amen but they're
[1:18:30] his chosen people
[1:18:32] he said don't lay this child next to
[1:18:34] their charge
[1:18:37] what do you think he was praying that
[1:18:41] he wasn't saying don't lay this to the
[1:18:43] Pharisee high priest
[1:18:46] he said you are of your father the devil
[1:18:51] and he certainly wasn't talking about
[1:18:53] the religious leaders when he said don't
[1:18:56] lay this to their charge
[1:19:00] he was talking about his little bitty
[1:19:02] group
[1:19:04] that was going to receive eternal life
[1:19:06] one day
[1:19:08] notice now I want you to watch this real
[1:19:10] close
[1:19:11] they were given robes they didn't have
[1:19:13] them they were giving Rogues now that's
[1:19:15] what the scripture says right white
[1:19:18] robes each one of them now the Saints
[1:19:20] now already have one
[1:19:22] like you here see we get white roads
[1:19:24] here the baptism in the whole goat but
[1:19:26] they were given but dire they were given
[1:19:29] robes and the Saints already had theirs
[1:19:32] and gone on CC and they had at night
[1:19:35] they they see they had not changed
[1:19:38] because they were blinded by God their
[1:19:41] own father told that the grace of God
[1:19:43] could be fulfilled to the bride so the
[1:19:47] bride could be took from the Gentiles is
[1:19:49] that right
[1:19:51] blind you
[1:19:52] go to the next one
[1:19:57] number 10.
[1:20:00] you sit out of the fifth CEO paragraph
[1:20:01] 246.
[1:20:04] how are you going to ever blind out
[1:20:06] Israel
[1:20:09] now he's not meaning God blinding out
[1:20:11] he's asking us the question
[1:20:14] see we think this or don't have anything
[1:20:15] to do with anything
[1:20:18] remember what I was saying a while ago
[1:20:19] they are the roots
[1:20:24] the roots of this Gentile dispensation
[1:20:26] of the bride of Christ has Jewish roots
[1:20:32] we're building on them they're not
[1:20:34] building us
[1:20:37] come on
[1:20:38] how are you going to ever blind out of
[1:20:40] Israel
[1:20:42] hey you're going to say they can't be
[1:20:43] saved is what he's saying right
[1:20:47] well if they don't come in this Gentile
[1:20:49] dispensation and receive Jesus Christ
[1:20:51] they're not going to get eternal life
[1:20:53] now where's your scripture
[1:20:58] I just give you a whole message a whole
[1:21:00] bunch of quotes words your scripture
[1:21:01] where's your quotes
[1:21:04] that's what he's just saying
[1:21:05] you can't blind to Israel oh how could
[1:21:09] that Prophet stand out there that day
[1:21:12] and say you look like a unicorn Israel
[1:21:16] whenever was trying to show him the
[1:21:18] worst parts of it and he said well he
[1:21:20] said whosoever blesses you'll be blessed
[1:21:22] looks whoever curses you'll be cursed oh
[1:21:24] my how are you going to do it how are
[1:21:26] you going to blind out Israel
[1:21:28] remember what our trouble today in the
[1:21:30] United States is what
[1:21:32] we have turned against Israel oh yes we
[1:21:35] are over there with the weather but yeah
[1:21:36] will I make them give up land
[1:21:38] or without making them give up the
[1:21:40] promises that God
[1:21:42] sin would belong to them
[1:21:44] that's right
[1:21:46] so we can't fight the whole worldacle
[1:21:51] I thought David done a pretty good job
[1:21:53] tackling it one day
[1:21:58] right right
[1:22:00] you think he was ready to afraid
[1:22:06] David picked up valve Stones right
[1:22:09] you know what an old
[1:22:11] Goliath had four more Brothers
[1:22:14] that's the story go read
[1:22:17] David probably figured I can take out
[1:22:19] Goliath but I better have some more
[1:22:21] Stones left over
[1:22:22] because there's going to be four more
[1:22:25] and I ain't going to be worried about
[1:22:28] might do it kind of like way be a dog
[1:22:30] and brother Mike and they take them all
[1:22:32] they went to Israel years ago and came
[1:22:34] back and they brought some little Stones
[1:22:35] you know from places and they got a
[1:22:37] little bit small just small Stone you
[1:22:39] know and it was there where David had
[1:22:41] killed Goliath
[1:22:43] and uh
[1:22:45] wait said Daddy
[1:22:47] you know he was seven eight nine years
[1:22:49] old or something I don't know
[1:22:51] he said Daddy said regular this could
[1:22:53] have been the stone to kill Goliath
[1:22:55] yeah
[1:22:57] one of that I don't know so I I kind of
[1:23:00] figured it might that might not be the
[1:23:01] stone you know and it you know
[1:23:05] it's like way more like book come on he
[1:23:08] said if he hadn't got that other one he
[1:23:09] could have got this one I said I agree
[1:23:11] with you
[1:23:12] but you see I can worry I mean David
[1:23:15] didn't work but now listen we ain't got
[1:23:17] time to read all of the parts you talk
[1:23:19] about the measuring sticks he's a
[1:23:21] unicorns of Israel just keep running up
[1:23:22] he had to Blind his own children
[1:23:25] to give us a change and we turn it down
[1:23:27] and don't now don't that make you feel
[1:23:31] about so little that you could crawl
[1:23:32] under a concrete block with a 10 gallon
[1:23:34] hat on and never touch it that's pretty
[1:23:36] small
[1:23:37] right
[1:23:38] yes
[1:23:40] they held to the word of God
[1:23:44] now he's talking about the Israel
[1:23:46] not the Wall Street not all these others
[1:23:49] listen they held see they held for the
[1:23:53] word of God
[1:23:55] they were Jews they had their law
[1:23:58] they stayed with it you remember last
[1:24:00] night they stayed with them and they
[1:24:03] were Jews and had the law and the law
[1:24:04] was the word of God
[1:24:07] remember we'll get back to it where the
[1:24:10] word of God and the testimony they have
[1:24:11] the word of God in the testimony the
[1:24:13] hell all right come on they stayed right
[1:24:16] by it that's right for the testimony
[1:24:18] they held they were martyred and here
[1:24:20] was sold on the altar after the church
[1:24:22] had done been gone
[1:24:23] now watch they had in their blindness
[1:24:27] martyred their Messiah and now they were
[1:24:30] reaping for it they realized it they
[1:24:33] recognized after it was gone on they see
[1:24:36] then when they come before the altar of
[1:24:38] God and now the grace of God to them and
[1:24:42] watch
[1:24:45] one paragraph
[1:24:48] you better read it again
[1:24:52] they had in their blind they smarter
[1:24:54] their Messiah
[1:24:56] now they were reaping for him
[1:24:59] actually 144 000.
[1:25:03] read it
[1:25:07] that's not the Israel
[1:25:09] of the fifth sealed you
[1:25:11] come on
[1:25:13] vaccine then when they come before the
[1:25:16] altar of God
[1:25:20] but now the grace of God is to them
[1:25:24] now watch now they could not by no means
[1:25:27] be Saints because it'd already be robed
[1:25:29] but here they are now your sold them to
[1:25:32] Altar for the word of God and the
[1:25:34] testimony they held or be in God's
[1:25:36] people the Jews but now watch the grace
[1:25:39] of God comes to them and Jesus gives
[1:25:41] them each one a white robe watch come
[1:25:45] over after the church is gone because
[1:25:48] they were loyal to their cause and they
[1:25:51] were blind to you and they didn't know
[1:25:53] it they didn't know it they were playing
[1:25:55] exactly the part that God had ordained
[1:25:58] for them to play and here here John
[1:26:01] looks over and he sees Souls under the
[1:26:03] altar now watch he sees those Souls
[1:26:06] watch what he calls them they cry Lord
[1:26:09] how long watch
[1:26:13] just a little while longer let's get
[1:26:16] down right through the scripture they
[1:26:19] realize they've murdered their Masashi
[1:26:21] and they didn't know it they realized it
[1:26:23] they got murdered back to pay for it for
[1:26:26] doing the wrong and now look what a
[1:26:28] thing that they had to do see they was
[1:26:31] guilty of murder until they got murdered
[1:26:33] see they cried out hit bloody on us
[1:26:35] that's right and they were blinded now
[1:26:37] if they hadn't have been blinded God
[1:26:40] said let them alone they're not worthy
[1:26:44] don't worry
[1:26:46] but being that they were blinded by God
[1:26:48] his grace reached down to them amen talk
[1:26:52] about Amazing Grace and give gave each
[1:26:55] one of them a robe because all Israel
[1:26:57] will be saved every one of them that has
[1:27:00] its name written that's right
[1:27:03] all Israel will be saved yeah
[1:27:06] one
[1:27:08] not every Jew not ever Israelite
[1:27:14] oh
[1:27:16] who are the children of God
[1:27:20] the predestination of God
[1:27:24] we're blinded that you and I could come
[1:27:26] in
[1:27:28] and we pick up right there Sunday
[1:27:29] already
[1:27:34] think about it
[1:27:38] Israel was God's people
[1:27:41] chosen among all the nations
[1:27:45] the only people on the Earth that God
[1:27:50] chose
[1:27:51] various people
[1:27:55] he chose Israel above every nation in
[1:27:59] the world
[1:28:01] and he made him a nation
[1:28:03] and they ruled and reigned as long as
[1:28:05] they were in God's will
[1:28:09] but when they got out of the will of God
[1:28:10] then they began to lose out
[1:28:13] but then they'd come right back because
[1:28:15] he never did stop dealing with Israel
[1:28:19] even at Calvary
[1:28:22] you read you Daniel said me Wicks and
[1:28:23] look at your drawing brother Reynolds
[1:28:25] said he was still dealing with Israel
[1:28:28] up until Titus that's right in 80 70.
[1:28:33] I read you books said he's still dealing
[1:28:36] with Israel no when that when I went
[1:28:39] across
[1:28:44] show me where he said it I showed you
[1:28:47] where he said what I'm saying
[1:28:51] he was dealing with Israel for until
[1:28:53] Titus come in
[1:28:55] not dealing with salvation unto him no
[1:28:57] he was not dealing with Israel as
[1:29:00] salvation in the Old Testament of the
[1:29:02] Salvation we're talking about
[1:29:04] let's do the Gentiles
[1:29:06] which is the new birth to receive while
[1:29:09] we're here on Earth
[1:29:10] he was dealing with him as a nation
[1:29:14] and he run to the world
[1:29:16] and they've been blinded and they've run
[1:29:18] down in those countries
[1:29:20] you've been down there in the bed at the
[1:29:21] mercy of those people
[1:29:24] when Hitler and them took over Germany
[1:29:29] had the money
[1:29:33] that's why Israel never did like I mean
[1:29:39] Hitler never did like him
[1:29:42] he tried to destroy every one of them
[1:29:47] killing them all over the world
[1:29:50] and they came to one of our ambassadors
[1:29:54] and asked for help
[1:29:56] and that Ambassador laughed and made fun
[1:30:00] of them
[1:30:01] and that Israelis priest or whatever
[1:30:03] what he was looked back and said you and
[1:30:05] your people are cursed
[1:30:09] you know the family and how many of them
[1:30:11] has died
[1:30:15] the coastline Ambassador wouldn't help
[1:30:18] her
[1:30:18] you think we're helping them now
[1:30:21] we're over there making them give up
[1:30:23] land
[1:30:24] to try to keep from having a war
[1:30:30] we're playing right into the devil in
[1:30:32] his traps that's why it's going to come
[1:30:35] in there with that Covenant Covenant
[1:30:36] that will be made
[1:30:38] because he's going to guarantee him
[1:30:39] peace
[1:30:43] that Polk's going to stand in there and
[1:30:45] guarantee him peace and they'll sign a
[1:30:48] seven year agreement but that's not the
[1:30:50] hundred and forty four thousand that's
[1:30:52] not the chosen of Israel
[1:30:56] that's that natural Israeli guy over
[1:30:59] there
[1:31:01] I wanted to never will get nothing
[1:31:06] but what about white robes given
[1:31:10] you remember that I said it the other
[1:31:12] day I said the greatest revelation of
[1:31:13] Grace
[1:31:14] it could be thought of
[1:31:17] is that God would give Israel
[1:31:23] eternal life one day
[1:31:25] the chosen ones
[1:31:27] will receive eternal life
[1:31:30] when they don't even want it they don't
[1:31:34] know anything about it
[1:31:38] but I hope you caught up the connection
[1:31:40] to what I say when that 144 000 those
[1:31:43] two witnesses
[1:31:44] tell that 144 000.
[1:31:50] you're going to die for what you believe
[1:31:53] I said don't you worry about it
[1:31:56] it's your brethren have already died
[1:31:59] and we're just waiting on you to be
[1:32:01] sealed
[1:32:02] when we get you out of here
[1:32:05] there's going to be something take place
[1:32:08] amen
[1:32:10] Israel is going to get light ropes
[1:32:15] Brother Robinson under the salad seal
[1:32:17] I've got that in here but I didn't get
[1:32:19] to it
[1:32:23] did you say you mean he's gonna
[1:32:26] give them eternal life when they don't
[1:32:28] want it
[1:32:29] what good did you do that God saved you
[1:32:35] right well I was a good person so was
[1:32:39] the Pharisees and so was a rich young
[1:32:42] ruler that done everything in the world
[1:32:44] but yet if riches grow into hell
[1:32:52] you see Church
[1:32:54] one more time
[1:32:56] Israel as a nation is going to be given
[1:32:59] eternal life
[1:33:01] the given light Rose
[1:33:03] even though they never accepted Jesus
[1:33:06] Christ as their savior because God
[1:33:09] deliberately blinded him that you and I
[1:33:11] could come in I'm not talking about that
[1:33:14] religious leader that was standing there
[1:33:17] that argued with Jesus and spoke hard to
[1:33:20] him and called him everything and got
[1:33:21] those people gathered together
[1:33:24] I'm not talking about this money-hungry
[1:33:27] bunch of Jews today around the land
[1:33:30] what about an honest and sincere heart
[1:33:32] of a people
[1:33:33] a group of people
[1:33:37] who's going to give their life for their
[1:33:39] testimony
[1:33:41] for the word of God
[1:33:47] and God's going to give eternal life
[1:33:51] you just think about that 144 000.
[1:33:54] they're going to be happy about getting
[1:33:56] eternal life
[1:33:57] they're going to be happy about what's
[1:33:59] taking place
[1:34:00] even though they know they're going to
[1:34:02] be killed
[1:34:03] they're going to be happy about it
[1:34:06] you say well how do they know they're
[1:34:08] going to be here because they can read
[1:34:09] the Bible
[1:34:10] the Bible says they'll be killed
[1:34:16] but to think
[1:34:19] that they would stand there and say you
[1:34:21] mean
[1:34:23] you mean my people
[1:34:26] are going to give eternalize
[1:34:31] and they'll say yes Paul said Israel was
[1:34:34] blinded
[1:34:35] they said all Israel will be saved amen
[1:34:39] amen all of that real true Israel is
[1:34:42] going to be given eternal life
[1:34:48] don't you think that'll make them cry
[1:34:50] Shout
[1:34:52] it ought to make you cry and shots
[1:34:54] no no I believe now is you gotta be born
[1:34:59] again
[1:35:00] you ain't going to Heaven's ain't born
[1:35:03] again I'm not making no I'm I'm saying
[1:35:06] that because that's the way it used to
[1:35:07] be you know the old-timey preacher Union
[1:35:09] you don't get saved you ain't going to
[1:35:11] heaven
[1:35:14] come on great win
[1:35:16] but now what about the foolish virgin
[1:35:19] just going to be giving eternal life
[1:35:21] what about 144 000 I'm going to be given
[1:35:23] Eternal what about the Israel of God is
[1:35:25] going to be given eternal life
[1:35:31] what you see folks who are Gentiles so
[1:35:33] let's talk Peter pattern
[1:35:35] and say maybe we've got to Hope
[1:35:38] our only hope is in Jesus Christ right
[1:35:42] and he used to work understand
[1:35:48] thank you
[1:35:54] complete
[1:35:59] to be given eternal life
[1:36:05] because God sinned
[1:36:10] church if we can never get it down in
[1:36:12] our minds
[1:36:13] take What God Says
[1:36:16] and look right straight at him with the
[1:36:18] word and say bye and you're a strike I
[1:36:21] am healed
[1:36:26] thank you
[1:36:28] and not take well the doctor says and
[1:36:31] everything and I'm feeling so bad I'm
[1:36:32] hurting
[1:36:36] stand right there and saying
[1:36:39] I don't care what you say
[1:36:44] I am healed thank you
[1:36:47] we're glad to say we're saved
[1:36:50] we don't want to lose that confession
[1:36:54] we'll hold our confession the same with
[1:36:56] salvation as we do with the healing and
[1:36:59] remember it is the same atonement that
[1:37:01] it was made under
[1:37:05] purely if God can save us Soul why can't
[1:37:08] he heal the body
[1:37:12] yes but brother Dale I said it now
[1:37:15] confessed it and that will keep saying
[1:37:17] it right amen that's where the trouble
[1:37:20] is that you ain't said it enough
[1:37:24] come on you said the lifetime one day
[1:37:26] and you walk out of our heel that's
[1:37:28] right amen that's right
[1:37:30] but when you start doubting it and
[1:37:32] questioning it right that's right
[1:37:36] then how can God heal us
[1:37:42] come on Church how many years 224
[1:37:46] each step I take
[1:37:48] anybody have a knee
[1:37:51] he stepped my tail My Savior goes before
[1:38:13] I have a date
[1:38:16] good morning
[1:38:51] foreign
[1:40:02] foreign
[1:41:13] I saw that today when I was studying
[1:41:15] this morning
[1:41:20] no wonder they cry
[1:41:23] no wonder that 144 pounds
[1:41:28] well they see not over their own they
[1:41:31] see their bleachers
[1:41:34] oh said he would be a Castaway
[1:41:36] is that what he said
[1:41:39] where's me
[1:41:43] please thank you a minute if he doesn't
[1:41:45] even louder
[1:41:47] he went every word of it he'd be a
[1:41:50] castle fight
[1:41:56] Maybe
[1:41:59] maybe that's what he was burdened about
[1:42:00] and God showed him all Israel he's
[1:42:03] saying
[1:42:16] already made a way
[1:42:23] it'll be contrary to every religious
[1:42:25] belief
[1:42:27] you understand why the prophet said
[1:42:29] there's going to be a lot of different
[1:42:30] agreement here
[1:42:32] you think you can appreciation
[1:42:35] the denominational atmosphere
[1:42:42] God is going to say this
[1:42:54] I don't see how that could be I don't
[1:42:56] care
[1:42:59] I'm tired
[1:43:16] keep
[1:43:18] ing but I know a lot of you even
[1:43:20] all names or something it's what I just
[1:43:22] got to be preaching about now that you
[1:43:24] left listen
[1:43:31] you hurt your feelings
[1:43:34] I don't give up
[1:43:37] give up I love you as a people and I'll
[1:43:39] give my life
[1:43:41] to one thing to try to preach this
[1:43:43] gospel to his purity
[1:43:46] you give a people a change to be able to
[1:43:49] receive
[1:43:51] instead of just pity pattern around
[1:43:55] well we're good people they're all going
[1:43:57] yeah
[1:43:58] yeah man years ago preached the message
[1:44:00] called as he said there's a place for
[1:44:02] everybody
[1:44:04] that even if you turn down this nasty
[1:44:06] day's a place for you well I agree with
[1:44:08] him there is one if we turn down this
[1:44:10] message it's called hell right right
[1:44:14] on Graves and then over all the way into
[1:44:17] the plane Lake of Fire
[1:44:22] no we can't climb blindness
[1:44:24] right that's right
[1:44:27] be real careful about saying I didn't
[1:44:29] understand
[1:44:33] I know I've done that but I didn't
[1:44:34] understand be real careful about it
[1:44:37] right
[1:44:38] because at the time he was doing it
[1:44:45] you might have been understanding
[1:44:52] there's no salvation outside of
[1:44:54] truth
[1:44:58] yeah
[1:45:00] sorry
[1:45:02] I wish I could give everybody
[1:45:05] and I can only give you one thing is to
[1:45:07] try to preach the gospel with me and
[1:45:09] where you can be set free
[1:45:11] because if you don't see that you need
[1:45:12] to be set free then you're lost
[1:45:16] but if you can see you need to set free
[1:45:17] then go do something about it right
[1:45:20] not a God to go to and cry out
[1:45:25] and he'll be there yeah
[1:45:27] but if you don't cry out for it it won't
[1:45:29] be there
[1:45:33] well I'll tell you what brother I've
[1:45:35] been in this message I don't care ever
[1:45:38] that ain't got nothing to do with
[1:45:44] it hell is going to be full of good
[1:45:46] people
[1:45:52] I think on these times
[1:45:54] Lord Jesus
[1:45:58] we're just trying to be as good as we
[1:46:00] could about expressing what we see
[1:46:04] and to realize that we're human beings
[1:46:08] and if you don't reveal it to us then we
[1:46:10] can't have it
[1:46:11] we can have a lot of quotes a lot of
[1:46:13] talks and ideas but
[1:46:15] we need you to reveal it to us Lord
[1:46:18] forgive our sins and guide us now take
[1:46:20] care of the people on the way home
[1:46:23] May our hearts turn with you Lord as the
[1:46:26] wheels turned upon the vehicle
[1:46:28] and may we see you living before us
[1:46:31] thank you Father for the truth
[1:46:34] you said you'd know the truth and they'd
[1:46:36] set you free
[1:46:37] we love you and we thank you in Jesus
[1:46:39] name
[1:46:41] you just need
[1:46:44] there's a blessed time that's
[1:46:48] that's awesome
[1:47:18] foreign
