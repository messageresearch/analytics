okay what day they're going to come it's important with all these people coming we need to know who's going to come on Thursday but not going to come Friday who's going to come Friday and not Thursday

you some of you sisters want to make us a cake we won't turn it down I mean we we won't do that we we'll make sure it gets divided you know so if you want to do it that way all right that's that remember those announcements remember then the 4th of July weekend we keep making that announcement to where that we'll have everything we're going to have the Saturday which is the 4th of July and we're going to have a cookout together here and a time together and then brother Vernon from the Philippines the Lord willing will be with us preaching that and preaching for the weekend so remember each one of those any other announcements Heavenly Father we thank you for being you because in doing that then all we got to do is find out who you are and the only way we can do that Lord is by the opening of your word to show yourself unto us because we're not capable of understanding things of life even as human Mortals to do the best that we can and we ask you father that you would just bless and guide each one of us now and as we talk about you that you would come on the scene to each one and speak to our hearts and our lives forgive our sins lead us by your grace remember the sick among us remember the promises you made Lord that you said you would send your word and heal us and Deliver Us from destruction so we Praise Your Great Name have your way now and we commit it all to you in Jesus name amen okay Revelations 1 verse 12 and I turn turned to see the voice of him that spake with me and being turned I saw seven golden candlesticks and in the midst of the seven candlesticks one like unto the son of man clothed with a garment down to the foot and G about the PS with a golden girdle and his head and his hairs were white like wool as white as snow and his eyes were as a flame of fire and his feet like undefined brce as if they were as if they burned in a furnace and his voice as the sound of many Waters all right now we go to Ezekiel where we were uh last Sunday and try to continue we didn't get to the point but we'll try to drop down to verse 24 in Ezekiel 36 Pharaoh will take you from among the Heathen and gather you out of all countries and will bring you into your own land then I will sprinkle clean water upon you and you shall be clean from all your filthiness and from all your Idols will I cleanse you a new heart also will I give the give you and a new spirit will I put within you and I'll take away the Stony heart out of your flesh and give you an heart of Flesh and I'll put my spirit within you and cause you to walk in my statutes and ye shall keep my judgments and do them and you shall dwell in the land that I give to your fathers and you shall be my my people and I will be your God you may be seated the Lord had his Blessing to the reading of the word now remember this is speaking to Israel we know that the promises and the things that were made to them and we see that that is now fulfilled what he promised there because we knew that Israel would be scattered to to the world and then it would you know would come back to the position to where in the end time that you know he said I'll take you from among the Heathen I'll gather you so we see Israel going back to the Homeland and and they've been back there and then I'll give you the land and I'll I'll do this and then he says I'll do and I'll put a new heart uh you know and a new spirit within you so that's speaking of the natural Israel and the promise that would come is coming to pass and shortly there from now won't be very long until they will actually experience this of the new heart the new spirit and the things after the Rapture of the church all right so this really speaking to Israel in the natural point but yet it's speaking to you and I in the spiritual point to understand of about the new birth and what it is and what transpires you know to you and I and taking us from the Heen and making us a people and bringing us to that and giving us a land which we don't want the land because it's not land that we're interested in we're not uh the Millennium is to the Jews even the you know the doing of the nation we be there we're there on a honeymoon and you know the things it's not that we uh you know we don't care about land this land is what we're talking about this inheritance of redemption the full Plan of Redemption which includes the Redemption of the body and see bringing us to that place but then showing us about the new heart and the new spirit now we'll get down to that in a minute and try to pick up the thought but trying to tie it back together of what we were talking talking about last Sunday and bringing it down to the the point of seeing Body Spirit soul and seeing where the new birth takes place amen it does not take place in your body because without the spirit it's dead it's just nothing all right it doesn't take place in your spirit now that's the thing that we're going to have to do a lot of things about and and I I realized and I know we were discussing it last night uh my wife and sister Trudy and I at the house you know it it has taken a long time for us to understand a lot of the things that we think we know now that's the best way of saying it we think we know all right see we thought as people that uh the new birth was just something happens to us something great takes place we repent of our sins we start living a better life we start doing things and you know and walking in that and even to find the message and begin to try to walk in the message and we thought we know we're born again well I hope that this little series point is beginning to uh kind of click a little bit with us that those things are not exactly right because you know it's the Realms we deal with and uh you get into your things of like well well what do you mean brother Dale I I used to be sad now I'm happy I used to I didn't go to church now I go to church I used to I wore clothes that was immoral and done thing and now I don't do him are are you telling me that I'm not saved well I'm telling you you can do every bit of that and not be saved right now that's the only way I I'm I'm not de christianizing nobody I I'm just trying to say it in the correct way that you can do every bit of that and still be lost well what am I depend upon you know what what is the the the thing what would I do you know I believe the message I I love the word I do and you could do every bit of that and still be lost I hope this is doning on us to where that we can see these things and then find out see as I've tried to emphasize a lot lately that you're not born again in your body you're not born again in your spirit amen because Satan can come into that spirit and impersonate everything you can have all kind of gifts you can do everything Paul said if you know it's in other words I give my life to be burn I do all of these things I I can do all great things have great signs and wonders right and have not the new birth what good am I amen right well you know you just make me feel like that that you're talking to me right well thank you I'm just not calling your name I'm talking to you because then I'm talking to myself and to anybody that listens as to know the Bible says make your calling an election what sure it says examine yourself to see whether you're in the faith or not right all right see then you say but but you've taken away brother Dale everything that I thought that I had my salvation based upon you know I done this I didn't do that I don't do that I got well have I told you the truth have we read what the prophet said about it to show these things right well all then it's not a point of me destroying anything it's the point of as a prophet said one day some how did he say about he said I'm not doing this to preach Doctrine right he said I'm doing this to straighten out Doctrine well I'm trying my best to get you and I to a basis of where that we can put our eternity based upon something that is is solid and not something that Satan can impersonate because he can impersonate all of the things the love the joy the peace the the thing he can impersonate every better that and you not be right the prophet say you can have what the genuine baptism of the Holy Spirit upon your spirit every day of your life and be just this devil possessed and still be lost but I thought the baptism was the Salvation well we've got a lot of scripture to we got to get lined up eventually amen you know the the Bible says you shall receive power after the Holy Ghost has come upon you so then there has to be a Holy Ghost and then a power right amen right that can come after the Holy Ghost comes amen all right and the prophet says what he says the Holy Ghost positions you in the body for the gifts and the things right but you can have all kind of gifts right and still be lost now that's a hard one to follow that God would allow those things to happen that way to try you and I to see whether we'll take the word irregardless of our feelings and our ideas our thoughts or no matter who tells us these things it's got to be a personal experience between you and God Amen to where that you'll know that's right and how can you know it you can only know it by the word that's right all right you can only know it by that all right so then trying to get you to think about it you're not born again in your body you're not born again in your spirit you're born again in your soul and the soul is the real you and that's who you are now these are very valuable because the Lord willing this afternoon I'll try to express to you what I see in the New Birth so I would invite you to at least get the message and listen to it if you're not going to be here this evening at least listen to this message because it'll be to me it it's one of the most uh valuable parts of the message that I've ever tried to bring all right now but listen by being a triun being you know Body Spirit Soul all right and being that triun being as to be you all the way you know your body is you your spirit is you your soul is you we were talking last night about something and you'll I believe it'll help you to catch this afternoon but you realize that the soul of an individual when God breathes into your nostrils the life that you come from the mom you know and and you're delivered and and he breathes into your nostrils the Breath of Life do you realize that that soul that you are until where you are today if you're 79 or 80 something that soul is still being molded and made into being amen cuz that's really what you are right and it's took 75 years to get me where I'm at so there's not no need of being in a big hurry you know I'd love for it to get faster but maybe there still some more molding that needs to be done to bring us into that now I say that but I won't I don't want to continue that thought all right we talked about last Sunday the inside of the inside am to where that God doesn't just deal with our bodies he doesn't he has to go through the body come on now don't lose me in just saying whoa he boy he's he's missed it cuz it's got to go through the body it's got to go through the spirit well come on folks I'm trying to say time I'm trying to shorten down the thoughts instead of extending them so long you ought to have enough sense to be able to know what I'm talking about all right that's right that should be enough to anybody that that you know that I I know what I'm saying in the bases sure your salvation Works back out through your body it works back out through your spirit but it's working through those reals you remember the last quote last SU that we was using on that thought justification is the work of the Holy Spirit sanctification is the work of the Holy Spirit but the baptism is the holy spirit all right now see then that way looking at it in that form you see that all of those things you can be anointed of all of that and it be not the devil anointing you necessarily it's God anointing you you know now you say well that that's just so hard for me to understand how that God would anoint me on my spirit and me be lost that's right right well my wife picked it up last night and talking she knows what I've said for over 40 years I've tried to explain something to you all right does the Holy Spirit go into your soul and what causes it to stop on some people and not go into their soul if you're going to believe it goes in you want to call it the sincerity you want to go to the lady feeding her baby to an alligator are you that sincere let's don't deal with sinceri and things there's got to be something wrong somewhere that causes things to happen so I would listen this afternoon the Lord willing all right but we're still on trying to understand see we're triun being we're Body Spirit and soul all right I have to explain this again because it always goes out and people misunderstand you in the brother bram's earlier Ministry he would basically teach that it would be Body Soul and Spirit he would put the center real as the spirit and he'd make the soul the second real so then when you get into Ezekiel we will refer to this again but you get into Ezekiel I give you a new heart a new spirit he said see there said you got a new soul and see what he's what he's saying is right but it's our understanding but then when the word opened to the prophet then after the opening of the seals and things he taught what Body Spirit Soul right all right now but he always gave body five senses see tastes F smell here he always gave the second realm of man no matter what he called it Soul or Spirit or whatever he always gave it five senses memory reason conscious affections and the cerim no matter what he called it he always gave it the one sense it's either Faith or doubt it's either God or the devil all right he didn't have to preach a great long message to explain he said what he meant and meant what he said and it was right but you that way you can use the quotes for whatever you want to use it for but I invite you sometimes to go into the Bible and study the word Spirit it does not definitely give you a definition from the word Spirit as to just take the l or reading off you've got to be able to figure out whether it's talking about the spirit of God or the spirit of man right yes sir right right because it doesn't give you a different definition for this one as to compared to this one right and then in the Bible it would speak of the heart of man and we know the heart of man is just a thumping gizzard you know pumping blood L say as a man thanketh in his heart well you don't think in your heart physically right but if you knew what that word heart is signifying at that time it's exactly right right because it is the heart the soul the part of man that is motivating us to cause us to think with our brain we'll try to divide that in just a minute with what the prophet is saying but watch now so you're not born again then in your body you're not born again in your spirit you're born again in your soul all right there's where the new birth takes place all the other things Satan can impersonate y right but he can not do the one part when he entered the human race back in the garden Drew The Serpent and the seed he was able to make an inroad into the human being causing the problems but yet he could still not cause that soul of Adam and Eve to be lost he could cause it to be that that it wouldn't come anymore like that and that he would have his inroad into the body and spirit and like we were talking last night about the uh you know say the Catholic church and their doing they say give me a child it's what s years old or something said 5 years old something said you can have it the rest of your life well I differ with them now because I believe the new birth will change things but I agree with them in the natural and they may stay 20 years in a Catholic church and get converted to a Baptist Church and go with that but they still got the same identical Doctrine they just don't kiss the Pope's toe no more they just think well I don't I don't want to do the hygiene part I don't want to kiss his toe so I'll just but I'll believe this but I believe the same thing all right because that's what they're doing and after what nearly 2,000 years of their teaching they've got a pretty good inroad into the human being that's right that has to be destroyed by the new birth right and only can be destroyed brother BR said I was looking at the other day he said the only way you can have any kinship to God is to be born again you know I know kinship in the natural to God and His beings all right but now there to save time brother brother says there's two forces in you one is working through your mind the other is working through your spirit you said but they're all together you're not listening to his definition he said with the the natural mind we serve the things of life and doings right and he said that cuts us off now I'm looking at that that's off the message Victory Day to world that there's two spiritual forces all right the very thing that he does he throws himself away from the spirit man that's within him yep by going to the Natural mind it goes away you got two forces you're battling it's in that Spirit realm but you're battling you you've read the message or heard the message the greatest battle ever fought and what did the prophet say God chose the heart the devil chose the mind all right see in your mind is where the battle is transpiring and right now you're sitting there I wonder what he's saying I don't know what he's saying I wish he'd hurry up cuz I'm hungry I don't know what we're going to eat for dinner but I guess we'll send a hubby out to get something it's just all kind of thoughts running through I'm sure I'm glad I'm not a prophet all right because what would you think if all of that was rebounding into your mind right you know you'd want to stop and say okay you're thinking this you're thinking that see I don't want that forget it but listen you're not born again in your body you're not born again in your spirit you're born again in your soul all right we've tried to explain over many many years that what happens in then the Soul is sealed in by the Holy Spirit Satan cannot get into there to make you lost all right but yet it can still work through your body and your spirit to make you no matter how religious you think you are and how great You Think You Are by the new birth he still has those two elements of body and spirit that he can work through to try to get you to doubt to reason to figure things out to to do all kind of things he can work through that and then it gives you a great understanding us to me anyway because I I I don't I know you don't think the way I but this is the way I think I I used to think well even in the Baptist I used to think well you know I'm born again I thought it was then but well why have I still got all these problems and you hear it in the message it's there same things you come on in the message and one day it was preached to us there's none good no not one and we just everyone was in that real that boy he beat on my toes today he really laid it on to me then the next service somebody come and preach that you're just as perfect as God Is by being in Jesus Christ and I thought okay but I got a problem cuz I read Paul that the things that I would I do not and see that Paul was having a struggle in life and he said then with this outward part of me I serve the law of the flesh but with the inward part I serve the law of God right that that gets in that brain and starts running around make you wonder what's going on but he was simply explaining a Christian right that we have a lot of problems and things to tempt us and lead us astray right right but it's not in that Soul because that soul is sealed in amen that's right all right but it's in that Spirit real that he's dealing with me in that he's causing my troubles then in the Bible would be right that his seed remaineth in me and I cannot sin exactly right but yet the scripture is right that I sin every day you see the Bible was put together then with understanding that didn't bother you no Brother D I just glad to yeah you was glad to just be able to Shout Scream and have a good time and when everything was going good and the preacher was really preaching some real good up toties you was up with it up toties and shouting Glory Hallelujah and going with it and holling amen but then when he started beating on your toes you start and you sire up and you start saying well you know you don't not be talking about me like that he donees call my name three times that didn't never bother you I like that's why I don't put my mind to anything you know and brother can tiar a car down Richard can TI a car part and put it back together you know it runs if I tiar it a part I don't even know where the parts at that you know I'd have to label every boat and put it back cuz if I didn't I wouldn't get it back together cuz I'm not going to put my mind to that that's why people say well you're a good Carpenter you just that you know I put my mind to that years ago I got tired of paying other people for doing things and then had go back and redo them so I started doing it myself well if you understand my point the only thing I want to put my mind to now is God's word that's the goal in my heart is God's word to understand God's word is right and to believe it and try to walk therein that's right we live we do we eat we do we work everything's fine but our one goal should be God's word the very importance of it now see then we got over to a point of thinking lincol trying to bring out who is it that does wrong who was it that Paul was saying was doing wrong at times and he's talking about himself the things I I would I do not right the things I do I would not it was just being honest brother brandom do you sin he said every day amen well the Bible said if you sin you're going to hell right cuz sin is unbelief all right so where was Satan's inroad Body Spirit and if something goes wrong in you and let's don't get it down to where that we're going to make it because we've figured this out now let's don't get it now though to the part that we say the devil made me do it brother Dale explained that all right I'm going to explain what the prophet says to make sure you don't try to go that way to say well I can't help it and that's just my spirit it ain't the real me so let's do with what brother Bram said he said Israel and the church he says the devil didn't come in he said you went out to him right now know I can read I got another one to where he says that that's referring to a lot of times as just those who hasn't crossed into the land yet so we we we we read but just remember you went out to him right just remember he says in the breach he said you went out to him he said because if he come in said he'd have to be like you if he gets into your soul he's going to have to be justified Sanctified and filled with the Holy Ghost so it's not in the soul right right amen cuz remember the Bible says the soul that sinth it shall die that's right let's just don't put it all say saying well I can't help it you know so I'll just put that as being in my spirit it might be a little deeper cuz if you're saying I can't help it and you're meaning that in the wrong way then I'm going to tell you if that's what's coming to you and you're thinking that way you are lost right because you would not be thinking that right amen you're not trying to get by with something that's it amen right we're trying to be honest and straight above board to live and be what all right so then it was not me I mean it was not the devil capable of coming into me no further than my soul I mean no further than my body and my spirit he can't come into my soul if I'm sealed in that's right cuz he's sealed out right but he can still has his inroad into that body and spirit to to make me think wrong and do wrong oh now there's a bad one see we we want to thinking is not too bad we we we kind of got where we can get by with that but if we go do it we'll say well that's what brother Dale said it was the devil in my spirit it might be the devil in your soul right because remember he's there until you're born again no matter what you think about it all right but you see what I was trying to bring out then Sunday you don't he you got to go out to him brother BR says that Holy Spirit is very shy he said if you grieve him he said he'll go out on a limb what a better way of expressing it he moves away from you in his presence and I can even go a long ways we're talking a lot a lot of things remember brother randam lost a gift for a long time because of something he didn't do you remember that it was pulled away from him but then it was brought back see all right so now watch then as we're trying to get to point of the message we'll get to Ezekiel in just a moment see then the Soul of you the soul is where the new birth takes place amen all right that's your being person who you are right and if you're listening you'll catch on real quick as I said it took 75 years to bring this being that's within me to a place right yeah now to show you what I'm talking about in the the the extent uh we don't try to make no age of accountability as a certain age but there is an age of accountability because it is different from different people somebody might be 80 years old in just the age of accountability because of their mentality right you know problems troubles but I believe that the brother said the most illiterate person could be saved now that's according to him you know all right but see that that part of you molding up through there is building a person within you that you are it starts making your nature your ways your things to be of what you are and by the time you reach the age of accountability see God is Not accounting that to you but then he starts accounting to you the record of life you know or what you're doing all right see he it's molding you amen into the person you are all right you can see I keep want to go to that okay that's this evening but all right but now what is a soul we read it from you must be born again paragraph 111 he said the soul is you right you are a soul that's what you are right the word Soul means being person what you are what you're doing and you know what to understand the way we do then if I'm just a Christian in body and spirit by anointings then with inside of me can still be the devil in his nature and his ways and I've got everybody deceived but me I can preach the gospel I can do all kind of things and I tried to emphasize that in the last Sunday's message that you can have all kind of gifts and that's your problem you have gifts of doing you see things and all and that's your problem because you put that on I must be saved I love the Lord I want to go to church I want all these things and still be totally lost right remember the devil wants to go to church too and remember he was over according to doing he was the worship Angel you know he loves to sing he loves Good gospel music I don't think he likes rock and roll I don't know how anybody could because it beats the Daylights out of my brain that's right amen especially when I'm riding down the road and it's louder outside than it is you know in that car because if it was that loud in that car there's no way in a world that person could live right because it does it spreads out further all right but now think about it what is a soul it's the real you right you're a tri being Body Spirit Soul all right that doesn't mean that you're just a soul and a now your body spirit and soul to make you a triun being because your body and your spirit manifest what's inside of you but as I said now be careful because it can be a religious remember the unclean Spirit goes out of a man walketh in dry places seeketh rest come back finds a house swt in garish enters therein and the person is what a religious person right they don't go back to the world a lot of times they become preachers they become church people why because that's the deception everybody's deceived even they're deceived Eve thought she was right right now you explain that to me and I don't have to explain nothing else that a crazy woman could do what Eve done and think she's right but she did and she still thinks she's right right cuz he said the church right she still thinks she's right right all right now so watch what we're getting at brother randam he gets to souls in prison if you want to go ahead and pull number six we'll read just a little bit CU we want to get these to where you make sure and understand it paragraph 44 and what does he say he says that Soul that's in there see that soul is what God is working on you said no I was sitting in the Pew and I heard heard him I heard the preacher well hey come on as I said while ago don't be right at least be sensible to think I'll be in some great Revelation you it's going to come through your hearing right and it's going to come through your memory reason conscience right but where's the main part it's supposed to go to right see you're going to find out what I said last week you're going to find out eventually that you're not justified and Sanctified in your body and spirit you got to have it on the inside and let it work out right because if it is you could just be Sanctified on your body and spirit and it wouldn't be worth nothing you can live a good life but is that worth anything that's right right that's better than living a bad one yeah but but what that soul is what God is working on if you can only get that nature now we're going to hit that heavy this evening but see that Spirit now you jump back say now he said Spirit he said Soul now he said Spirit well sure it works back out through your spirit correct amen but it's the center part of you that God is working on to agree with him watch then that nature dies Y what did you sold ey or was it the nature of it right you see there's where that you hold on to your original thoughts you got a problem the nature and the love of the world dies now he's putting it to what it is and the things of the world is dead see because if you love the world the things of the world the love of God is not in you and a man must be born again so this Nature has to die and the nature of God comes and lives in you right he's dealing with nature right and God is the only thing there is that never did begin or never can end see there's your secret of eternal life all right but look at the next one which is number seven this is taken from paragraph 36 of the souls that are in prison the soul of man is not the body it's the soul see the soul is something that's watch him the nature of the spirit okay because my spirit will display what's inside of me irregardless of whether I'm lost or saved right right right my spirit displays what's inside of me even if I'm lost are saved right all right because there's the nature part the it's the nature of the spirit and then when the nature of a man now watch when he said we are dead the scripture plainly tells us that we're dead and our lives are HID in God through Christ sealed are by the Holy Spirit right Amen to that watch now it wasn't that your body died right it wasn't your spirit died it was the nature of your spirit whatever is motivating it amen right died see the nature which is the soul amen all right now but now here's where it gets confusing to mankind because you go back to the old tapes and you use that soul and nature and things and you'll bring it to the second realm of mankind goes in the old quotes if you use soul and if your mind is still leaning to that Soul as being the second part of you then look where you're at you see why did I try to do that with you to get you to think about it see if you're still dealing with soul as being the second Rim as you would use then you're going to get a New Soul you're going to get this you're going to get that brother got on to me about saying a scripture which maybe I shouldn't say but I don't don't mean it to use it wrong cuz that's what he accused me of he said don't use scripture wrong I wasn't using it wrong the original translation where it says that a double-minded man is unstable in all of his ways you know what the original says original says a two soul man that's original translation you double-minded man means two Soul Man well see he thought I was throwing in against the two Soul people I wasn't doing that I was saying what truth is a double-minded man is unstable that's right if you got two things in your soul leading you at the same time you got problems so you are unstable the Bible's right all right but watch now watch him here as he explains it because see under the old to Soul Doctrine they said your soul is the nature of the spirit well okay that's fine if you know how to place it but if you're placing it as just the other part of using it wrong and see when I quoted this to a brother standing in front of the old Armory up at Jeffersonville where the spoken word was this is what he said cuz I quoted him this quote see brother Brown said the nature of your soul is God if you're born again the nature of your soul is God if you're born again if it's not it's of the world the brother he see because he hooked in on that Soul nature so much till he said how can a nature have a nature amen I said why don't you argue with a prophet cuz I ain't going to talk to you about it there was no need of us discussing it because see his mind was still Soul as nature not bringing it up as so as the inner being and bringing the nature of God within you because that is the new birth we'll get to it this evening is when the nature of God comes into you all right but see he says and watch the nature of soul is God if you're born again if it's not it's of the world so what's the nature of your soul today God if you're born again it's of God if you're not it's the devil right so one nature or the other one's leading us right right okay look anything to begin has an end so therefore the only way that you can have eternal life is to have a life that never did begin and then your life did begin when you were born your nature your being your soul when God breathed the breath of life into your nostrils and you became a living Soul then you begin then all right so then to understand then that the new birth is not in your body right that the new birth is not in your spirit that's right it will work back out through your body and spirit yes but turn it around and say it this way the devil is in there that works back out through your body and spirit too all right and you know what then that devil can be in there can be a religious devil and your body and spirit will be of a religious nature that's right okay so one of the others ruling us today amen your soul is either born born again or it's not born again we can't put it on whether we go to church whether we're good whether we do a PIR tide where we we do all of these things you know right uh you can't put it on all that you got one thing to put it on and we got to get to that this evening okay so we'll try to run real fast now let's read this let's go back and read Ezekiel all right go ahead and put pull up number eight brother let's read Ezekiel and get this point because to me this is what SEALs up the point you know I love to uh read the Bible and I love to read it and watch what it's saying do you believe that in explaining The Parables of the seed and things do you believe that if you don't understand the parable of the seed you cannot understand any other Parable maybe you ought to read lot how many of you read The Parables lately would it throw you for a loop if I said Jesus said that you know what a lot of people say he never said it well we'll read it this afternoon that Jesus said if you don't understand the parable of the SE of the seed you cannot understand any of The Parables okay now watch Ezekiel we're going to 36 26 a new heart also will I give you and a new spirit will I put within you and I'll take away the Stony heart out of your flesh and give you a heart of Flesh now according to that God is in a great business of heart transplants what does that mean a new heart also will I give you and a new spirit I'll put within you well that's a good P that makes a good person he's got a new heart he's got a new spirit right I'll take away your Stony heart out of your flesh and I'll give your heart of Flesh well we're going he GNA take out my heart because it's heart he going to put in one that's soft now that's not exactly the story right this is talking about the New Birth he'll take away your heart he doesn't take your heart out he doesn't give you a new heart the heart of man is the center of man no matter where it's placed at because a heart of a seed is always the center of the seed that's not the it can be all set in the the doings but he's not talking about a heart transplant to take out your heart and put in a heart right it's a working upon your nature of your way of what you are because the word heart is the word soul amen okay so as a man thanth in his heart you don't think with the physical thumping gizzard right but brother Ron said I love it because it says you think with your heart you remember that he said the man said well you can't think with your heart you think with your brain he said no no the Bible don't say that you don't think with your brain your brain is just a computer you think with your soul you don't see with your eye right well I do I look and see but that's not the point there something else got to make that work not the eyeball there something else in that intelligence that transmits the images and does those things to make it come out do you see the what you're looking at all right but I give you a new heart I'll take away your Stony heart right just think of the word heart is being soul and not thinking that he'll take out your soul and give you a New Soul why don't you work on the nature of it and just let that be what it did see the nature of our soul is worldly that's what we just read that's what the prophet said if you lost the nature of your soul is of the world right if you're born again the nature of your soul is God so then he did take out the old nature Stony ways thoughts there's a couple of messages I wish you would listen cuz I'm not going to be able to get to them today but I wish you would listen to these two tapes why some people can't keep the victory all right that's preached in 1957 324 listen to what does it take to make a Christian Life preach in 1957 uh 113 listen to the impersonation of Christianity as three messages that if you'll listen to them you'll hear him explain in Ezekiel that great ly did you get them the impersonation of Christianity 57120 the morning service all right what does it take to make a Christian Life 57113 there is another one there is two of those impersonation of Christianity I'm pretty sure the other one is why some people can't keep the victory all right he's explaining Ezekiel all right now I give you a new heart and a new spirit will I put within you now does that mean it doesn't mean to take the heart out and put another heart so it doesn't mean to take the spirit out and put another Spirit that's why people are concerned about it you remember when they first started doing the heart transplants all right back in the 60s when it was in there and the people of this message said I ain't no way in the world I'm going to let them take my heart out and put another heart in cuz I won't be the same person you remember that did you take out my heart you put another heart in I won't be the same person I'll be the person that my heart comes from all right now they've even put in mechanical hearts and people lived a while right one guy live what was almost a year a little over a year the one of them that they put the mechanical heart in well now who was he during all that time his nature his heart went a garbage can right who was he that's why I've always said hey I'd love to have a brain transplant it wouldn't bother me to think who am I because there's a whole lot more to it than just your brain that's just a recording mechanisms and Thing If It took your brain out put another brain see we think we'd lose every bit of our memory come on that's like I went to get my cell phone got a new one you know and the kids told me and said well it save us a lot of trouble running in all the numbers if you'll just take the phone in and let them have it so I took the phone in I gave it to them you know what they took the card out of my old phone the SIM card and they took it and put it through a device and run it back through and when he handed my phone I had all my numbers reserved you know but see what we think that you put in that and and you lose all your numbers you would if it wasn't on the SIM card but see that's what we think a new heart and a new spirit well it don't mean to give you a new spirit why don't you just take it to words I said that your soul would be your your heart would be your soul and and he would begin to work on you all right justification starts a work in the Holy Spirit Spirit of the holy spirit in your soul sanctification starts the work of the holy spirit in your soul working on the nature of it if you want to bring those words in but not taking the soul out and throwing it away it's just working on the nature of it to transmit it to God making it a soft heart mellow you down working upon your meanness and hatefulness and things and starts mellowing you down well he gives you a new spirit now see here's where I'm glad that we had a prophet because this is his definition he said you get a new heart you get a new spirit you'll hear it if you listen to them messages he said you get new desires see where you where once you desire to drink to crous to do things and and all you get a new desire you don't want to do those things again you want to go to church you want to Fellowship you want to be with people of like Precious Faith all right because there something happening to your nature of that being that's within you right remember you're not born again your body not born again your spirit you're born again in your soul so it's not the soul I mean it's not the body and the spirit that gets Justified the justification is working on the inward part of you in the soul the sanctification is driving the unclean Spirit out hey I've been at this 40 something 50 years AR so don't think this is just some new doctrine and I read about his brother so and so they come up with this I don't read about so and so I don't listen to so and so I study God's word if I hear somebody preached on these items I will do the best I can to get their messages and listen to them with an Earnest heart as to not be critical of them because I want the truth they said give you a new heart well then they give you a new spirit now what does that make you oh that makes me a Christian cuz you ain't reading the whole Bible That's Right pull it back up now you ain't reading the whole Bible that's right cuz ours where the Prophet if you listen to these messages go ahead and pull that back up on Ezekiel a new heart also will I give you and a new spirit will I put within you and I take away the Stony heart out of your flesh and give you an heart of Flesh and I will put my spirit within you now listen to the definition just in a second and cause you to walk in my statutes and you shall keep my judgments and do them you don't walk in the statutes of God too good out here in body and spirit right only after you get the new all right go to number nine we'll try to finish this up look what he says from why some people can't keep the victory now if you listen to these others I gave you and listen to this Mage yes what we need today is experiences of the new birth wonderful start now I want you to watch the order that Ezekiel brought it in he said I give you a new heart and I give you a new spirit and I put my spirit in you I want you to watch there stre of it a new heart I'll take the old Stony heart away that's that old different heart that you have you know meanness arrogance hate and I give you a new what spirit and many times there's been terrible been a terrible mistake the people has thought sometimes that that new spirit was the Holy Spirit but it isn't it's a new spirit it's not on this one maybe well I guess it is you can't even get along with with each other with that old spirit all right so you'll hear that so go ahead but it's a new spirit God give you a new spirit why you couldn't even get along with yourself with your old Spirit right how you going to get along with the Holy Ghost God had to give you a new spirit so you could get along with the Holy with his spirit and sometimes people a new heart a new flesh so you will receive it then a new spirit in that heart and then I'll put my spirit in that you see the new heart new spirit my spirit three things all right amen give you a new heart and a new spirit he said there's where especially the Pentecostals you hear him saying this on the messages I ask you listen to he said there's where the Pentecost was made their biggest mistake he said because they thought they got that new spirit well I say it's the biggest mistake for all of us because see I was a sinner you know I was out in the world and I went to The Altar and asked God to forgive my sins and he took away that old hateful arrogant attitude and if you'd ever known me you would have known I didn't have a real bad one that's not bragging that's facts I don't have to brag I tell it like it is it's not bragging that I so good that's why I've always tried to tell you people think it's because it's so living so good and doing you don't drink you don't smoke well I didn't do that was I saved the whole time no mainly because I couldn't afford it but see other people put their desires and things above what their flesh was and they went out and dranked it and then took the bread off the table from the kids and the clothes off their bodies and dranked it up and I I just always had a good nature about me that I didn't that wasn't in the problem my kids my wife and my family got first that's why my wife didn't work you know the story I told her she could either work and I'd stay at home with the kids or I'd you know I'd stay with the kids let her work whatever either which way or she could stay with them she had her choice why because I wanted my kids raised with a good atmosphere here and doing I didn't want them to have to be sent out every day to somebody else that does them have you read this up in gainful other day where they they've got the case started where the the little child started about four years old I think it was and they were selling her body to people and they were supposed to been taking care of her well they gave her life in about 80 years I think so I don't think she's going to get out in my way of thinking I'd rather do that than to kill her because she can at least repent to God somewhere down the road and maybe he'd save her but I don't believe in in killing people cuz I believe the longer you live with your problems is worse than killing you killing you is a shortcut right that's just a you don't have to worry about it no more that's just brother Dale okay but now think about it I take away your Stony heart I'll mellow you down I'll bring you to a place that you know you can get along with people and things and I give you a new spirit which is a new desires and things and you want to go to church you want to do right but the prophet said there's where the mistake is that people thinks that is the Holy Spirit the new birth he said that's not true now you hear him in these messages I ask you to listen to you'll hear him say those things over and over and over but then he says then I put my spirit in you he said there's the Holy Spirit but you know the holy spirit's not going to come into you unless the Stony heart is gone and unless you've got a new nature upon that Spirit controlling and leading you're not going to get the the new birth that's why the prophet says that's why there's not so many new births I'm honest now I'm that's right I wish people wouldn't take me wrong and just take me what I say what is the problem with the people of this message they won't listen to you reading the scriptures let alone the prophet's message to them but yet they claim the prophet was a prophet if I'm going to believe him to be a prophet I'm going to try my best to stay what he said and when he says things that don't sound right according to me I'm going to know for sure there's something wrong with me when he says and we we won't do it this today but we're going to have to get to it because there's some things I've got to try to answer to the B the prophet say you're born again and then baptized into the body well see that's contrary to most people's thinking but so is it contrary to most people thinking that you're not born again in your body and spirit you're born again in your soul that justification and sanctification is a work of the Holy Spirit within the soul of the individual to bring the individual to the place read the future home you we just went through it to where that the life of God can come into you but he can't come in when there's anything left right amen that's why I love to read the word of God you ever noticed in The Parables one of them says they understood it one of them says they received it one of them says they keep it the three different times that it's told Matthew Mark and Luke of The Parables but we think that's not important well we'll read this evening where brother brandham I mean where the Bible says that if you don't understand this parable of the seed you cannot understand the other parables I didn't write that the Holy Spirit did through the words of the Lord Jesus but do you know he said that or you like some who said brother Dale said so and so said I'd say no brother Rand didn't say that said then he just pull the quote and lay it out and read it well I thought that's what we supposed to be let stand come on musicians L anybody has a need but what is the point of the message the new birth doesn't come in your body your spirit is in your soul to make you a new creature it doesn't make you a new creature in Christ Jesus to have an anointing upon your spirit and it be the genuine anointing of the Holy Spirit does not make you a new creation it may work upon the spirit part of you to change things cuz I believe that I believe that there's a lot of people today sitting in the churches even the people of this message that have come no further than justification and sanctification and they've got to that new spirit part of them and they're not calling upon God to bring them to I'll put my spirit within you they're just taking their feelings around ideas or thoughts or loves or Joys or happiness and believing everything the prophet said well why don't you believe everything he said when the prophet says you misunderstand that to say you get a new spirit he said people take that as being the Holy Spirit he said it's not the Holy Spirit it can be the Holy Spirit working upon all of those senses right right that don't make you a Christian well I thought I understood till you preached it I done my job that's up to you to take the rest of it and decide within yourself whether you're born again or not that's right right and it's like I've told you I don't expect for the biggest portion of you I'm not preaching out there I'm preaching here I don't expect the biggest portion of you to even consider that you may not be born again because you've been taught all of your life that If you deny you're born again deny the father you deny the son well let's keep the Trinity then that's Bible right you a that nobody throw that in your face when you're trying to talk to them about one true and living God and they'll quote you the scripture the Bible said If you deny the father you denied a son and said he's going to deny you boy that's really great going let's straighten everything out what do you think about it what is your new birth amen the word that you know that you know go ahead brother 539 anybody have a need me clean heart oh God and renew right Spirit Within Me cre me a clean heart is that your desire Lord take away my heart that hatefulness that me had all these problems take it away Lord give me a heart to love everybody even my enemies give me a new spirit Lord God I can't even stand my St for the one of God then put your spirit within me to make a burd he's got to go on a trip today on his job so let's just pray everything will be all right Lord Jesus just be with our brother as he travels and all take care of him give him a safe journey there and back home let everything be for your honor and glory in Jesus name can I quote the prophet a good old Baptist said watch him quote scripture he said because Abraham believed God he W SC Abraham believed God and he was counted as doing for righteousness that's scripture what you Prophet say he said that's right he said but what did God do to Abraham that he gave the sign of circumcision he said he walked different God done something for Abraham has he accepted your believing that's the question one more then real quick has he accepted your believing remember he accepts you we oh no we accept him oh no I just accept what he done he accepts me won't do no good to me to accept him okay well ain't God good ain't God good let's sing that that's what we are you know what that does to him let's believe let's pray for it Lord Jesus upon the basis of the truth of your word that we believe we can come to the truth of believing about healing and knowing that by your stripes our brother is healed and we send this PR CLA for him Lord and we ask you to just take away all the problems but we believe you we place everything that we've got upon your word Lord but there's not anything else for us it's all in you and we believe you in Jesus name we are the father you dismiss sing that to one another as you're going all of his kingdom and we are family we are one oh ain't God good to give us so many in blessings undeserving that's what we are to thank Himes a
