========================================

amen i don't want to see him don't you good to see everybody in the house of the lord amen he'd like to turn in your scriptures turn where we've been reading in revelation 1 and then we'll read from revelation 6. now remember the announcements that we'll be making and keep on making remember the watch night service will be um on the 31st and on the 30th which is the sunday uh brother jackson will be here preaching for us for on the sunday services and on the monday what's night survey so remember that and i'll be much in prayer for that a sister that goes to brother richard wilson's church their sister kenny i think is the way to pronounce it but her son was attacked last night somewhere and stabbed multiple times and he's in real bad shape so they wanted us to pray for him they were two boys actually that were attacked and her son was the worst one out of the two but let's just pray this morning that the lord wouldn't touch him they already had to give him i forgot how many but it was many many many units of blood and he's already died about three times because of the loss of the blood and the different things so just you know just pray for the boy that he'd come to it and be all right remember wade is over preaching with the pageant today and remember them and any other announcements i generally forget but to what's not service remember that now a few sisters want to fix a few things to bring it would be nice to worry that we could have something to eat after we get through with the what's not service then we wouldn't have to go nobody hadn't have to go eat or anything and the way we generally do is we get here at eight o'clock well we generally get here early enough if you want to come in and eat a little bit before you come upstairs you know you can do that too so we try to do that we do a lot of eating around here and it pretty well tails on all of us who remember that amen so the scriptures revelations 1 and revelation 6. heavenly father we thank you lord for this day and your love unto us thank you for calvary thank you for all things we know that you give them to us freely we don't have to even ask for them in the basis that you know what we have need of before we even ask but yet you told us to ask and we shall receive so then that makes a double part of it to word that we can ask you and depend upon it the lord jesus would just be with the family there of this one the boy that was stabbed that they're trying to take care of him for the two boys lord and just be with the boy and bring him out of this and lord make everything to be all right we know that we've prayed and we we believe you and be with the families there of the of the children that were all killed our lord and just bless them and the different ones that was killed we know the prophet said it was insanity would be in the streets and we see it lord that's don't ever hand these things are taking place but we know and realize true that we believe that you said you'd take care of us so we believe you we depend upon that have your way now as we read your word you come and speak to our hearts and direct us in what to say to your people in jesus name amen revelations one told the brothers that give them a vacation today they don't have any quotes to run so we'll be on comments and questions so you know they can kind of take a little relaxing time it says the revelation of jesus christ which god gave unto him showing to his servants things which must shortly come to pass and he said and signified it by his angel and to his servant john to by record of the word of god and the testimony of jesus christ and of all things that he saw blessed is he that readeth and they hear the words of this prophecy and keep those things which are written there in where the time is at hand all right we'll go over so we'll be dealing with the seals and questions and comments so we will just read the sixth seal verse 12 of the sixth chapter and when he had opened the sixth seal and lo there was a great earthquake the sun became black a sackcloth of power and the moon became his blood and the stars of heaven fell unto the earth even as a fig tree canceled her untimely figs when she is shaken of a mighty wind and the heaven departed as a scroll when it when it is rolled together and every mountain and island were moved out of their places the kings of the earth and the great men and the rich men and the chief captains and the mighty men and every bondman than ever freeman hid themselves in the dens and the rocks of the mountains and said to the mountains and rocks fall on us and hide us from the face of him that setteth on the throne and from the wrath of god for the great day of his wrath is come and who shall be able to stand he may be seated over that is blessing the reading of the word now we were going to have questions and answers wednesday but the old long-winded preacher got too much involved and we didn't get housing so we moved it over to this morning and so then if you have any questions comments and things um you know about what we've been speaking on in this study of the book of revelations then you know if you would when we get around to it we'll uh give you an opportunity to comment article to ask the question about the things now we've come up through the seals and we've we've come to the bases now talking and trying to finish up on this sixth seal but we've been talking about what did the seals reveal the plan of redemption all right now it was the things that mankind even though it was done at calvary even though jesus christ came and paid the price we realized still that at this time we are still in these mortal bodies you know death doomed mortal bodies and and in doing that then something is not finished about the plan of salvation but i believe this is the end time i believe this is the time that it's to be made known even as romans 8 says that all of us are waiting and everybody is waiting on who the sons and daughters of god to come to the position to work that god can be among us as we were talking about wednesday and change these old bodies that we live in and take us in a rapture all right and it says darren roman said we're waiting to wit to understand to to come to a position of knowing about the plan of redemption and you know we look back and we say well it was paid for by jesus what do we need to know well we've been running now for 2000 years i can't believe we need to know something that's right if not we might be around here two more thousand years you know because it's not a bus pulling up for a time you know where obama as a president or whatever you want to do and i'm not against any of that i don't vote i don't say for you not to i just say i don't vote last time i voted i voted for john f kennedy and i found out we put a catholic in the white house and we found out from the prophet's message that's what we come over here in america to get away from and we brought him over here as our president but i i have nothing against any of them who you put in the office it wouldn't matter i told you about the doings you know and i don't argue with nobody about politics because what need is it my bible says i put in kings and i take out kings amen that's right so ever who's supposed to be in the office is in the office all right so everything's right with god you know so you'd say well the world's coming to an end in a few days because 21st of this month is supposed to be the end of the world according to the mayan calendar you know and everything's supposed to end right there well i don't think so because we are not in a rapture yet we're still here and even if you did they would still be if we left right now they would still be three and a half years of earthly time called the tribulation so who's worried about the mayan calendar i'm not concerned about that i'm concerned about mine in your calendar you know what i mean by that i'm concerned about our salvation all right because we need to know the plan of rejection all right now and in doing that then we found some marvelous things in the taking and not dealing so much with the seals and things but just taking them and looking at them and and then seeing what applies to our sales and studying it from that and asking you to do that on each one and you'll see more this afternoon while we've been saying that that i've been wanting you to study the seals read of yourself but what about what do i try to encourage you to do read them to see what is talking to you we know the symbols we know the writings we we've had that interpreted unto us all right but yet what does it mean to you and i the prophet said it one day like this he said god opened one of those seals and john saw his name well have we he said have we seen our name through the opening of the seals yes that's right and we found our name in the book not samuel dale but what's going on during the time that that name is on the earth all right now so then we found out that these things it comes down to the ages we saw the seals as they open we've seen how that they revealed a white horse rider red horse rider black horse rider you know and pale horse rider then we come up to the fifth seal and we found that there's no symbols there that's very important i hope you'll remember that i asked you to write that down about what three or four months ago i guess but anyhow i said it'd be very valuable one day because there's no symbols under the fifth seal it tells you what it is it's sold under the altar as people now we needed to know who those people were yeah but it's not a symbol it had to be broke it was right there in the letter of the word that paul on that fifth seal talking about it you know not knowing he he didn't call it seals but he said all israel will be saved so we went through that seeing not ever israelite but all the predestinated would be saved all right that's not a symbol that's a statement of a fact about people then we went on into the sixth seal and talking about the great things that we just read here of the great tribulation that would come upon the earth you know all right and then we went through the point of how that revelation 7 was the showing of the 144 000 that would be sealed in the tribulation period but would have to be put there because they rejected the messiah you know israel rejected jesus christ thereby they must be purged and even though those those hundred forty four thousand the two witnesses know even though they receive eternal life here by the rejecting of the messiah they still have to be purged all right so they're put right in that tribulation period for the purging you know because everything that's not purged must eventually be purged somewhere even this world one day at armageddon right it will be a purging of the world all right that's not when it goes on over to the future home now but it is a purging of the world getting ready for the millennial reign can you get out of the millennium like this i hope we don't believe like some people believe that the year we are today and we're going along you know and mad because we got to go to work tomorrow and don't like our bosses but something just happens click and there's a doctrine of this you know and they just click and all at once we just all go to work tomorrow and happy well i don't think that's exactly right i miss the whole plan of redemption myself if that's what it is but see we believe that there must be a purging all right and israel must be purged for her rejecting of the messiah that's right so she's put in the tribulation period for that the foolish virgins must be purged because of their rejecting of the true god or the truth right now see then it's not god's fault because there will be a great multitude of of gentiles as we call them which means nations will be in the tribulation because of their rejecting of the truth see people who say well i never rejected the truth but what about the truth where can you go preach the truth too you know so you can see there's going to be a vast majority of people in the end times going to wind up being foolish virgins because you can't preach the truth to them well then just bring it on up in this message and see then you can see you can't preach the truth to the people of this message because even some of you still have your own comments irregardless of what's proved or said from the word you'll hold your own thoughts well someday that's if that's true your thoughts are true it'll be all right but if not that's going to be purged now the bride does not have to go to the tribulation right so their purging is going to be here that's right amen by the new birth we're purging our soul by the washing of the water of the word the revealing of god's word then you and i are washed here it's not a purgatory we go to but it's a purging of ourselves right a repentance paul said i die daily now was that a tribulation no but it was a purging that's right they said we don't have to go through the tribulation because we're the bride of crops those who receive the new birth as the gentile dispensation don't have to go through the tribulation but those who don't receive it will have to go to that point all right we see even the world has to be purged before it can go into the millennial reign satan will have to be bound there all right by chain of circumstances not a log chain think satan can be changed by some lock and key you know he doesn't have anybody to work through the prophet said that's the best definition you can get see he's chained he's put into a bottomless pit and chain don't have nobody to work through in other words people won't listen to him no more that's right he's done been proven to be who he is and they won't listen we see that brings the purging of everything that we found on the sixth seal because that sixth seal deals with the tribulation period all right see it starts off by an earthquake it starts off by the great things happening you know and then it comes down to the end of the world and that was the three questions in matthew 24 that they asked jesus you know when will it be there won't be one stone you know won't be one stone left on another he then brought around said that was titus in 80 70. well that's you know all right then said what will be the sound of thy coming well the coming of the lord is right now among the people where there are you know whether whatever church you'd be in who you still have to believe this is coming now all right and then the end of the world we see the sixth seal is the end of the known world not destruction of the world because it never will be destroyed right it never will be totally annihilated out of existence it will be purged amen and getting ready to word that god can live on the earth and fulfill the promise to david of sitting on the throne in the millennial reign all right and in doing that then we see that the sixth seal will be the end of the world as we call it the next after the end of the world sea would wind up to be uh the millennial reign the millennial reign then is where the scripture says that the first heavens and the first earth is passed away all right the first earth is now the first heaven is a millennial reign so one day that will pass away and when it does it will be going into a total utopia of eternity when the future home comes into existence but we're trying to just stay with what's revealed in the seals but see the complete plan of redemption is revealed in those six seals the seventh seal don't reveal nothing it just says silence in heaven let's place a half hour now it can be revealed because the prophet said i'll tell you my revelation but now what is that we'll get to those things this afternoon the lord willing and start on to that point and maybe we'll make it by the millennial running but see all names then we covered and there's a question on this and i'm just getting this part all names then are revealed on the sixth seal because it shows the completed plan of redemption and all names are revealed that will ever be upon this earth by the time the tribulation period hits all that will ever be saved or anything if we're going to believe the the tribulation to be you know the the great earthquakes and the things happen would be the end of the known world then there won't be a place somewhere else that names will be present so it's all revealed here even though the feel sealed jew is sold under the altar still they're killed from calvary down to where we are that's right all right so all names is revealed on that and the white throne judgment when it comes it won't be a revealing of names it it'll be a destruction of people in a giving of eternal life to the foolish virgins right who stood for the word the best they could all right now then in doing that we want to take the point and we have that see you and i have to be purged as i said a moment ago well bless god i don't see him shut up you're lying you're about like jack cole said when that lady came up there and said brother cole i want to lay my tongue on the altar he said i just gossip all the time and i want to put my tongue on the altar he said ma'am this time this pulpit and alder's only 15 foot said there ain't enough room for your tongue that's pretty strong man but it's true that's right right that's right but you see a bride has to be so purged not going through the tribulation to be purged but the revealing of god's word is what purges us that's right brother brown would say one day like this he said talking i think of revelations 5 i'm not certain but he said that makes you like it said you could just you could crawl under a concrete block with a 10 gallon hat on now that's how little it makes you feel if you get a revelation and it blows your head up i'll tell you up front that's not god's word being wrinkled to you you see these people that couldn't walk in this building because their heads are big and if it rained while they outside they drowned because there were no stuck up in the air and i'm talking about the preacher in this message you know real quick there's something wrong but random they said was the most humble man you've ever seen the lord jesus was the most humble man see a revelation never never builds you up a revolution will take you down i've never had one yet come to me that it didn't humble me because of thinking lord you would reveal that to me when the world is full of good people and yet you would reveal yourself to me if it don't humble us it's not a revelation it's an exalted extent of our own sales now watch what i'm saying those hundred forty four thousand i'm getting ready now for the question so anybody got any writing down get ready 144 thousand the feel sealed jews the the uh foolish virgins they're actually purged by the word made manifest i hope you think that over that sixth seal we just read is god's word you agree yes i mean we just read it out of the book right we just read it we just read what would take place that there'd be these earthquakes and they'd be all kind of drastic things you know would take place upon the earth and a great purging time see then they're actually purged by the word that's made manifest or into reality right now we don't have to go to the tribulation right right so we must be pursed by the word that is revealed to you and us see when it's revealed it'll be made manifest right but i hope you understand the difference and we'll get into the question see like 144 000 of people like that that word that's made manifest or that seal that breaks is the word of god made manifest on earth a purging of the world and all kinds of things see that's an example to you and i that the word that is revealed to you and i is what's going to purge us this bride is going to be so purged until she could take a change until she can do it we were talking about wednesday and sunday and all surprised until the world is waiting on you and i to reach that position everybody in the line of redemption is waiting on you better read revelation i mean uh hebrews 11 because it's dealing with old testament science and then it's dealing with people down through time right right that comes into gentile new birth and dispensation they're waiting on you and i to reach a place to where they can be returned back to mortal bodies to reality they're dependent on you and i that's right see then we must by the revealed word as i said a moment ago if that word when it's revealed to you don't take you down don't make you weep and you just want to walk away i've said many things from this pulpit that you think i'm crazy i preached here a mini a sermon that i could go sit down in that seat and wonder who preached actually wonder who's doing the preaching i've had it hit me so much until i literally wanted to walk out the door and just walk home that's what a revelation will do too it won't blow you up me my mind might look at me you gotta come to me and get it no you see that happening you need to get away from people you need to get to the reveal word they are repeat are purged by manifestation we are verbs by revelation god revealing his word to you and i all right now let's get into the questions and i said you write down what you're thinking on and then we'll try to get to that and if we have to we'll take this afternoon whatever we have to take it don't make no difference to me i gave the brothers the quotes for this afternoon where they would you know they could be ready and everything else but we don't have to take them we take them next week or next year don't matter to me but here's some i got some questions i just want to cover and then you you think about it and maybe you're thinking on these questions or whatever you have on your heart write it down and then we'll give you an opportunity he said brother dale said revelation 6 12. and that's where we read now about how that behold when he had opened the sixth seal and lo there was a great earthquake and in the great things it started happening under that says what do you see happening in here and is this the future or has some of these things happening right now as far as the sixth seal part the opening and the great earthquake and the great problems the way i see it is that that'll happen one day that's in the future because that'll be you know to the world and the things when we get out of here but yet we lead up to it the prophet of god you're talking about we'll get to it in a second he said after a series of earthquakes and look at them around the world today probably a thousand a day almost somewhere around the world you know if you calculated every little tremor of a little movement and look the great ones we've seen with 300 000 or something people just earthquakes out in the ocean you know sometimes you see that's not the sixth seal that's a preacher revelation because you and i can be right now and we are we're in a preach revelation hitler and eichmann and all of them killing all those jews the prophet would call it a pre-tribulation which means before the tribulation the great tribulation will open with a great earthquake all right so then the things leading up to it we see but to read the seal itself he said behold when he had opened the sixth seal and lo there was a great earthquake all right now when that seal opens there will be a a great earthquake take place all right amen because the bible says it will all right now all right see now here's another part of it so are there two quakes los angeles an amount of olives you know we're talking about los angeles going under one day prophet said it would and we believe it science says we don't know when but it will i mean that's their statement it will one day but it can't stand what it's doing and uh then the two earthquakes los angeles and when the mount of olives cleaved and the mountain pushes up you remember they're over in the time after we get out of here all right now are they the same the person was asking now i don't believe it's the same because i believe that there'll be a great earthquake and los angeles can go under and that's not the opening of the sixth seal see that's what we've always taught and thought about right but i've never taught it that way because there's so many earthquakes to deal with in doings until you can't just lay it down and this was it you don't find brother random saying the sixth seal opens with an earthquake in california goes under you know he doesn't stipulate those points he just makes the point that one day there will be a great earthquake in california would go under well see there was an earthquake when jesus raised there could be an earthquake when the resurrection takes place in california could be that earthquake see that's what what i've tried to tell people to try to warn people 98 of the people of this message believe that california went under right now and we're standing here we're in the tribulation come on you gotta ask them he said well we're going into we're gonna be out of here california goes under we'll show me where brother ryan said that that's got to be your idea yeah but it's going to be a faster well sure are these vast earthquakes right now i mean 300 000 people over there that likes one that was an earthquake out in the middle of the ocean and then the tidal wave went in one of that thing that kept ripping open you see church that's why i've always tried ahead of time to tell you where you wouldn't be so shook up is a word we use and i'm sorry for that language out there on the internet system some people hear that wonder what shook up mean no we're all nervous oh down and out scared to death you know because i stood many years ago told you we could pass 1977. and we're practicing the year 2000 rolled around and said bring your flashlight will you we're going to have a what's not church in case you're afraid fill up your tank before you come unless you're scared i've always tried to tell you ahead of time see if we're sitting here right now and i know it'd be a drastic happening worldwide because of the way the prophet would say things were happening the tidal wave reached our way to kentucky all right he said well nothing couldn't survive that evidently it does but that could happen and you and i still here because that's not if california went under right now i always thought that after the resurrection that we'd be here 30 40 days that was my understanding but then you'd be if you took the earthquake in california to be the opening of the sixth seal then you put the bride in the tribulation for 30 40 days see people don't even think the only thing sensible you see some great revelation and everybody said oh in california go to but what if it goes under then you're still here come on see i just try to tell it as straight as i know i know i get in trouble you become a sarcastic arrogant old dude it's intellectual but we're still here where was you at when 77 rolled around and i said we could be here longer than that oh that just makes you exalted no it don't make me exalted it makes me very horrible that i could stand in 74 and say we could pass the year 2026 and i say now the year of 2000 or 50 your 5 000 would make no difference because of the way you entered the jubilees you see everybody else was sending their books back scared to death i wanted it to come yeah i want the resurrection to come before california goes under you know i want the dead to raise and let's get out of here before california goes under because i don't want to be here with all that horrible things that place but i'm just saying it could be see then the earthquake to california would not be connected with the earthquake over when it spits the mount of olives because according to the bible when that happens he'll stand with one foot on land one on sea or whatever it is or the scripture and it'll cleave not a great big jesus standing there right but pushing up getting ready for the millennium and getting the purgings and the things that are set forth doing so is it the same one no i don't think so i believe there's a difference in it i believe the tribulation period begins according to reading of the bible with the opening of the great earthquake i know the quotes so don't run too far they brought around said they can open that earth that seal anytime they want to it's true that's true but has you ever thought about that it doesn't mean brethren said tribulation sets in here works its way to israel while they're getting their message you got to do with the breaking of a seal before you can have the revealing of the seal before they can open that seal it's got to be revealed to them simple language simple points but think about it there'll be many many earthquakes because they're all around the world today see that's why we don't look to earthquakes brother dale if i'm around here out of that earthquake california i'm gonna know i missed it i'm not gonna say i need it amen i'm gonna say god's word has been made manifest you believe god's word will be made manifest when it goes under because that's what the prophet said it was going to do that'll be the word of god make matter we don't have to deal with tribulations but then there will be one earthquake that will be dealing with tribulation what's always been amazing to me is if you'll notice when that earthquake takes place or that opening when you get on over into the scriptures and picking them up and putting them back with this sixth seal you'll find that the thirteenth chapter i believe it is it no two witnesses you know the great things will be taking place in their ministry great earthquakes can be happening everywhere i'm reading the thing brother aaron brought me the other day about the things and see right now all you have to have is a change of the polar axis of the earth and you say that can't happen they can prove about 400 000 years ago it did take place but now brother dale we've only been here 6 000 years you better read your prophet's message said when it says in the beginning god created heaven and earth as a period there he said that could have been millions of millions of years before he started dealing with to bring it into use so they can take their carbon content and prove certain things but you better study on your carbon content because there's a lot of things they won't they won't study the human body on certain ways on the carbon content because it gives them the wrong reading you'll read a little bit about the things that they deal with they're coming to find out that a lot of those things that they thought was people that existed millions of years ago to come to find out to be a hoax thing but that's stuck to the world that's not up to me i'm trying to answer questions i don't believe the earthquake in california and los angeles going under and the mount of olives cleveland will be the same earthquake because i believe there'll be many earthquakes i believe the sixth seal will open with an earthquake because we just read it out of the bible great things can be taking place but i believe california can go under right now and you and i can still be around here 30 40 days and don't put us in the tribulation right see one of these days when we get back preaching on the tribulation enough because to me the tribulation is a wrath of god poured out this is not tribulations that are happening now 300 000 people over in that license died you know everyone died back there and big old words just showing these i can't pronounce them great title waves killed 3000 people wasn't a sick seal i think the wrath of god being poured out everybody said oh look at the wrath of god poured out because they were so mean whoa i'd be careful to talk like that we might get a few minor ones and be it ourselves okay now let's go on so that would be then not the same earthquake all right here's another question these things come from what i've preached on the seal tonight it's a question all names revealed under the sixth seal does that mean as we see who is sanctified by the purging seal literally and by the word all names are revealed the prophet said on the sixth seal before the seventh seal opens on this coming we'll get back to those quotes all right as i said a moment ago then all names are revealed why because that is the complete plan of redemption you don't have to go to the white throne the ones that go to the white throne are the people that are on earth here before the millennial reign you understand yes when you go to the white throne it's not not being a a group of people artists you don't have no names for it it'll be that they were already on the earth as people so all names then are revealed in the plan of redemption because it shows who can be redeemed it shows how they'll be repenting it shows even that some people will receive eternal life at the water on judgment but it shows that some will never receive it nowhere and be cast into fire and it'll take part in the second death which the second death is the death of the soul see you can blow my head slap off but you can't kill me only god can kill the soul that's what the bible says said don't fear the man who can destroy the body he said fear the god that can destroy both soul and body because he has that white throne it'll be god saying go you rejected the word if you reject the word you turn down the word then what can you argue with god that's right what can you say to him he said didn't you hear say yes well if you heard it then you have no argument we see all names are revealed said does that mean that as we see who is sanctified by the purging seal literally and by the word see that's that's those people that we see the full plan of redemption is made known by the time of the sixth seal so then you see every name that would ever be revealed or it would be revealed and why they wouldn't be wouldn't be i mean made known or why they wouldn't be saved and why they are saved what is the plan of redemption we don't have a court of appeal the fight whites on judgment is not a court of appeal it ain't going to do you much good to pledge a case right it ain't going to be that it ain't going to be a judging jury right remember the bride sits on the throne with him and remember all that god's got to do is turn back and say you see that person did you reject what they were saying they don't want me no choice see this thing is is it's made to work that you and i should be into the place but now watch all names are revealed because the end of redemption is made known by the time of the sixth seal and even those who go to the white throne judgment their name would have had to be made manifest here on earth during the time of these six seals all right so that's the answer to the question the best i can give see then the sixth seal will be the end of time now once he said no no no no the millennium is a thousand years you know but you went back to 360 days to a month how many years you went back to 30 days to a month millennium so time will have ended as far as we know it of the mortal time that we exist now that will be time yes but not the 365 and a fourth that goes back in the millennium to 360 days to a year 30 days to a month perfect order see so it can be made manifest right now does anybody have any questions right now because i'm trying to relate it to this and i'm not saying that next ones are not related to what we preached on it is but this to us to the seals anybody got any questions now just to the seals or what this or what that and then we'll cover some things of the questions that are related to it are our redemption and the redemption of mankind look hold on just me i'm gonna have to get to brother um uh i predict before the coming of the lord jesus god will sink that place don't come before your los angeles so that is what you've been saying just it just took care of that right we'll be here i predict before the coming of the lord and his prediction i'll take him i'll take that we're about the rest wouldn't you also he said you know he said your main goal on the book is sanctification right well you code you you that's that's your you haven't even got your new birthday but see you move on and you move right on into what you're talking about so they should start exposing or revealing or bringing you into your position and revealing your name by the word that's preached to you that you take it it comes into your mind and go down through the channels and you're so when he brings it back right there he lets you know right right exactly you see when your name goes on judas is 91 on the book of life he was part of a religious order but it was taken out because he didn't go on that's how i used it to be anybody else any comments thoughts i don't want to know what's on your heart don't worry about saying brother i don't agree with you you know my father you don't bother me because i know one or two things neither i haven't made myself clear you know and that's the one thing i want to make sure did i say it clear and direct you know what i say to word it you know you can say well you know i don't agree with this but then i can say well okay this is what i believe when we ended up talking because i believe the complete plan of redemption is exactly what it is it reveals all redemption then brother garrett you hold it when you raise your hands we get to that we want the microphone to maybe this is a little bit uh outside but those ages that have gone before us move through wesley and the ones down through there we know that the mystery of redemption comes in the end time are they going when when this is all over uh and the rapture takes place where where are they going to be an understanding are they going to be at the capstone is there going to be a capstone understanding or will they grow in in knowledge over the time that we spend in eternity or where will they be after they receive their bodies their natural you know their physical body and understanding of the plan of redemption right i see no problem with the fact that luther wesleyan what they talked as to where when we get over there you know that we could sit down and talk about things and they could understand things you know i don't believe that when we leave out of this world that is going to change us from what we are that's where the prophet said it right he says what i am here that's what i am there all right but the fact is they're going to be there first number one lutheran wesley and them the people who taught the the you know started out with the the just shall live by faith they're going to be there that's part of the bride of jesus christ but that way we'll have something to talk about you just think about even in the in the millennium a thousand years of being able to talk about jesus christ i might get all i needed to say in that moment that way you could have four-hour services and nobody gets tired you would not worry about it but i believe we'll still be growing in grace and knowledge when we get there i believe it'll be the i believe what we get here is just enough to take us there then when we get there go how can you how can you exhaust the word if the word had no beginning and has no end how can you ever exhaust it so the prophet said that we'd receive the message of cheer down to the endless ages it won't be a redemptive message to redeem us because they'll already be redeemed luther west of them already be redeemed be there any eternal just as much as anybody but what would be the problem with us sitting down talking with them about it and you know when you get about the iron it is you know the women preach your doctrine to be gone you understand what i mean by that in this time elements in ways stay out a little bit talk about the word of god but don't try to preach there'll come a time where there won't be no problems there'll be no preacher standing there saying you can't preach sister brenda go sit down uh see it'll be a wonderful opportunity to be able to talk about you know we don't all see now i understand what i'm saying to the point of answer we don't all see god identically word for word points because if it did it wouldn't be a body of christ that's right now we all see the one god we all see the revelation of god but yet you uh brother would be had a good point he said no one with a holy ghost said you can tell yourself if you listen to her i believe that somebody don't even know how to hardly write their name or sister birds i told you about that i preached one night for an hour and a half how did he come from god and he went to god and i was trying my best to explain that and on the way home she said brother dale said i saw it okay she said he come from god and he went to god said he was god all the time i said i spent an hour and a half trying to explain that and you put it in five words could i believe that i believe lutheran wesley would be glad to sit down and listen but you know what i'll be glad to sit down listen to him talk about justification now because it wasn't a doctrine when luther saw that it destroyed catholicism as the work to get us to salvation it didn't destroy living for jesus christ or being good it destroyed what they were teaching what a wonderful time it'll be what a wonderful time anything else anybody else sister anna someone um because back in africa my dad always worries about his grandmother because they never knew english and they never knew of jesus and the fact that god will raise the heathen in the millennium and give him a chance so i could see them there now um you say all names are revealed made known under the sixth seal i don't understand what the statement means you mean nobody everybody who's been on this world is all under the sixth seal because the stick still is the okay in other words you were reading the book and and you look over the back and in the back of the book you've got all of the people that wrote the book right their names are there you know so-and-so's and we appreciate this person that so you got a group of nines that don't put them all the way through the book the it just simply means what brother dane was saying when a peace person comes to sanctification brother ron said your name goes on the book as a believer he even brought up the old testament science with that form and how that they brought in a bullet being a believer and it would set them aside from being what everybody else was be a believer see god puts your name in the book of life not in the lounge book of life because that's the eternal section those were put there before the foundation of the world or never will be put there now there will be a moving of names when they get to to the watch on judgments you can move the names of the foolish virgins but then there will be pride and things that is how their flight is but see my point is that by the time that seal opens which is not open yet right okay see by that time every name that would ever be made known on earth he's been brought on earth good or bad see every name by that time is brought on earth because if not a bunch of names come on later to be handed on down through see the names has already come everybody that would ever live on earth if the sixth seal is the end of the world all right then that would be ending of redemption okay so does it mean no children are born in the millennium the way some people think i sure don't want to think about being born from the bride now i'll balk on you in a hurry if you say they're born from the bride now brother and said i don't know he said it looks like they may be and looks like they're not but i'll stand firm on one thing that's what i do when i make a statement i stand with that statement that i make i'll stand on one thing there ain't gonna be no kids born from eternal people in the millennium because that's gonna put sex back in the wrong place and you certainly don't want that in a glorified body you know an eternal moral body human being not going to have sex he brought around when they went beyond the curtain of time he could hug no sisters no problem notice all gone it ain't gonna be like i remember telling a lady one time and i got so tickled until because it was what she was doing and we were talking about that you know that one day we'd be made eternal and i said you'd be like 21 years old or something like that you know and this expression came over her face and she went well i had a problem with reading this expression because i kind of figured what she's thinking about she's thinking about them curves coming back she was thinking about all of that 21 years old instead of you know the little pudgy see it's going to be a wonderful time wonderful time thank you one more question what do you think my folks will look like those heathen that will be raised in the millennium will they be 21 year old will they be in the theophany or will they be natural you would think that that wouldn't put in a complicated form but i'm not meaning you are i mean when those either to me that are raised in the millennium i don't believe they'll be raised at 45 years old but i don't believe they'd be raised up as kids there would be no use of it see it's not a point um bring them up into youth you know now not in eternal do you understand that's why it's hard to express something i don't believe the healing when they're raised up will be eternal that's right because there wouldn't be any need of calling them up they won't have eternal life now if they get eternal life while the gospel being preached to them you can believe that if you want to i'm not going to argue and i'm going to say neither way because i don't know but i believe they'll come up as a young people and all of that now i can't understand how that the millennial scripture says that uh uh they will die at a hundred or something which what it is and instead of sinner or not hurts i don't understand that admonishment i know how they understand it maybe you do could explain it to me but i believe the heathen when they come up that you you know and i'm not saying your grandmother because maybe she heard of jesus christ some way see we don't know what we'll say maybe she didn't see me all right then god can judge her according to how she lived in her tribe and her beings and her life and he can raise her up in the millennium and how the gospel preached to it because you think see i know that we we put a lot of emphasis on brother brown was a prophet but do you realize where we'd be if you didn't believe who's the prophet you realize that right i need about two hours right now you just think for him to say that a heather and there's no bible to say us a heathen will be raised up in the millennium now you can go back and pick up scriptures and see that you're speaking of these things but i'm saying no scripture this this this there's no scripture that says the filth sealed you sold under the altar is all the israelites or something it doesn't say that i think when we received a prophet he was to turn us back to the word to what the word is really saying that's right and you think about it you say well how do you know about this either what's your thoughts i believe in a just god it will not condemn people without bringing them to a judgment right what do you believe that's right my god is not a dodeo granddaddy but when he says it he'll keep his word and that heathen that never has heard what are you going to do with you won't throw them into hell because they never heard you see folks we've had more than a prophet we've had the mind of god delivered through a prophet to speak to you and i have you never thought about the people of the world that has never heard about jesus where's those people going what's it going to be but a prophet says a heathen could be raised up i shouted glory hallelujah when i heard that when i heard him talking about that feel sealed jew and realizing what he was saying that those jews that are real sincere jews that never heard of jesus christ back over there in those countries you know sent to the world because of the scattering but you're saved they'll be brought up you see the salvation i've got has no limits now the word keeps me from giving it to everybody i hope you understand that statement i can't go out and give salvation to everybody you can't either but i can give it to those who believe you say give it to him i can preach to him can't you can't you offer it sisters whatever you're talking to your neighbor can't you offer them eternal life yes if they'll believe the word is that what you're talking about to you anything else yeah sister trudy never coming this way that los angeles quake is going to be a really devastating situation exactly it's going to totally break this country but i'm wondering about bride that's going to be involved in that tidal wave when you look at our administrative fear will the bride be at the same level of revelation and can they somehow speak and be protected from that tight away sorry i'm glad you're asking me what i believe i'm like this if god told me to go to california today i'd pack up a girl i wouldn't be worried about it i wouldn't be concerned about that pack up and go but when i would keep asking him how long do you want me to stay here and if he said one england go home i wouldn't spend no time selling my home i would spend no time telling my boss at work i had to leave i would be on a plane head east or somewhere i'm i'm actually as honest as i can because the what would you do he said well there's a lot of people out in california that believe the message are they there because god told them to be there are they they are just um rebellious now i'm not throwing off on people just making statements brother told those people when he was there in the opening of the seals not to go to arizona he told them don't go they made statements one did from here two did that brother round later told him said you caught more of it than i did because he went i'm not going to argue with him i'm just going to say brother brown said they're out there starving to death and you know that even for many many years they poached illegally gang to feed those people that was out there and brought around you about it now that's their words okay right around told one of them said hunt high and the game warden won't get you now i believe he said that i'm not going to doubt the brother but i'm just making a point he told them not to go he said that's my kids out there starving what was he going to do yeah they thought they were led of the lord to go out there it's all right this leading of the lord is a mighty thing most of our leading of the lord is leading myself and get the lord sometimes might agree with it but i'm just giving that as an answer if i was in california right now i'd be praying and i said lord do you want me out here if you don't ask me what time the next plane leaves i'm going to be on that airplane because i've never believed in being done stupid i can't help that i was born right away but being dumb is a different situation well hey people will bless god god will come and get me how many years ago did i preach to you that the biggest portion of the people that was in this bride would have to die and go by the grave how many years has that been 30 probably right because i may be one of them time keeps on going i'm sure we'll so will you gonna get too old but the point is i could see that the reason it's gonna come is because we won't line up and i titled the message persecution not tribulation persecution why we must have it because it is we're not honest people who get down to seriousness and we need god to jog us that's right if god told me today said move to new york because george is going under i say well show it to him in the word lord that's all i've asked him if he showed it to him in the word i'd be leaving tomorrow to go to new york that's what he told me but i believe in doing what he tells us to do i believe he can shield us and if you're getting what i'm saying those who are really in the word in california i would be close to moving yesterday well you don't believe the lord take care of him i don't believe in tempting him either come on i believe in doing what he says he says california is fixing to go under you can see what i'm talking about that they could be a vast majority of the people of this message that would be in california would go down in the ground of course i've never thought off on nobody maybe you don't think like i think i'm sure you don't sorry about that but see those people could go under the earthquake and tomorrow be raised from the dead to stand on earth brother dale give me scripture okay i'm glad you asked for that one according to my understanding in revelations 13 those two witnesses are going to die and lay there in the streets for three and a half days not three and a half years or three minutes later three and a half days and they're going to raise so they must go as they die into the sixth dimension where all christians go and then they'd be released from there to come up so california could go under and those people can go down with it georgia could go under and you and i could go with it but we'll be up very shortly i'm not de-christianizing nobody you could come up in a hurry and get out of here if you die and go by the grave i die and go by the grave don't say i'm lost i never talked nothing like that in all my life i've trying to preach the truth i got in trouble years ago explaining that a manifested son could die and go by the grave before the change i fought that heavily but you don't want the ones who said they didn't believe it they already died and gone the grave i'm still here this is the church i've just tried to explain salvation redemption don't say that somebody that dies that they don't have the faith right we're under the curse of the world we'll take another few seconds and then we'll take this afternoon the rest of the question we're in the curse of this world because you're sick doesn't mean you're lost doesn't mean you're done wrong it means we're under the curse because old age is a curse it is placed upon us because of a curse some people's genetic dna makeups or what you want to call them are stronger than others and they can fight off diseases and be healthier and and do things but we're still dying and we're going to keep dying until somebody comes to the place that we can walk out here that group of people that's going to be standing there going to have to call that dead out of the ground you say if california went under today brother dale would you say oh we missed it now i'd say we're going to call for you see you can't explain what a prophet is expressing it looks like the whole united states would be totally annihilated don't have to be california can go under florida goes up ever run around and send a tidal wave all the way to kentucky it's all right you know that one time in history the mississippi river run upstream because of an earthquake you ever studied that they can prove it it ran upstream caused an earthquake see if you backed up the mississippi river and that hippie is what is the ohio is that the next you know my rivers are off you put them in the place watch me look at the mouth okay but my point is if you backed up the mississippi river backed up the ohio river you'd shoot the tidal wave into kentucky it wouldn't have to destroy what's here i've always just tried to be sensible but brother dale i've seen that earthquake and just come all the way across the united states now run around where'd he say that he said it died away well he's got to come all the way no back up the mississippi river should have died away the world would be killed it so much because when california goes down florida could be the peninsula right for the world you see we're trying to interpret a profit in visions am i doing something sensible i hope that's the answer what you're talking about if i was out there i'd be packing up ready to go home you know get out of there and then i'd be coming somewhere but where to go i mean that's a good point to them where to go where can you go run around and told us what to do he said i just got it he said they want to know where the place is where we need to be he said now brother and sister i just got it you know there's asking should we move to arizona should we do this he said i just got it he said we need to be in jesus christ amen that's right amen no matter where we are we need to be in jesus christ i'd rather be standing on the mountain though then the okay pinocchio the only problem it might roll over but it's a whole lot stronger right right that's why i haven't moved to california you know the lord said go to california i would first off say it wasn't my i hope you i hope you you're telling me what to do in the right way because i sure don't want to go because of my own intentions you know my own thoughts we'll take this afternoon because it's nearly 12. now you got one third of it i didn't mean that wrong we have 10 minutes no mr anna i had that question too and what i got from the beginning of the book he gave it to adam and said adam you filled this book up with both the word children names and spoken word children well adam failed because they failed so god took the book back from adam and he started putting names of all the redeemed that were saved baptized for the holy ghost he started putting names in that that he died for so that is the book that went back to the hand of god from adam because adam failed he did not put the name under the spoken word children so god took the book back so he started redeeming them and he put the redeemed names in that book and when the world was over when the sixth seal all the redeemed names were going in there oh well foolish virgin might go in there but uh that's when the book is closed because all the redeemed names are in that book so i'm very simple but that really helped me when i saw that i don't think it's too simple i think it's the truth no god knows how to work all these dudes ain't nothing out of cater brother dale we've been here all these years and we've been still believing the same message yeah because god's been trying us to see what we'll do see if we believe what he says here regardless of everything goes wrong you see yeah but i see this and i see that you know that god told noah get in the honor no rain in seven days you better go read your bible and read your prophecy it didn't rain in seven days did god lie no he was just extending time to let other people think about it it rained the seventh day you remember brother brown and said the kids come around to know and they said no you said it don't rain in saturday you said god said he said he'll rain he's been trying us for a long time to see what we'll do even when things go wrong it doesn't look like it ought to be when i said we could pass the year 2026 i never had no thoughts whatsoever in wanting that to happen i wanted it to take place that day i was just saying what the prophet had said i believe the reveal worked and i had it wrote in my notes not all the words we read a lot of difference in the word we read and the reveal no word you know that those old testament scribes and things they could take that old testament stand in jesus face and say according to the bible this is the way it's supposed to be he's coming at the mighty conqueror and he did right but they failed to take the other one that said he would he was a baby and see that that baby laying in that manger was the mighty conqueror bible's right it's our interpretation what we got you might have a need you are 176 and sparring one second we'll take up the question this afternoon so during the strong service write them down where you'll remember them you know and say well this or that jesus oh is i know i believe i'm healed no matter what i believe i mean this body is redeemed i'm going to start saying that because if i don't say anything lord jesus anybody else great anybody else uh oh oh yes this is my story oh oh three you
