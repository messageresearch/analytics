I hear it running so Aaron's not here to adjust the temperature but you can turn that on if you want to I appreciate that uh good to be back in the house of the Lord uh you know we were talking about electricity today right before we closed and I knew I I had I knew that Elisha brother Elisha Negron from from Ohio he's a master electorate I mean he he deals with hundreds of thousands of bolts in in a Factory sitting setting so he sent me a note by he sent me a a uh Marco Polo a few minutes ago and he said he said well he said this is the way to look at it he said you got all that voltage he said now 120 volts will shake you he said how many people were in the upper room now he give this a night because I thought it was 240 but he said it's actually 277 volts we'll grab you and hold you he said 480 volts he said there's your body change [Laughter] 480 it will blow you out of your socks and change your body it'll put you in a different place but praise God for that we maybe we need some voltage going on you know a little bit of power and like yeah this it's a Dark Age dark hour though man you go you know tomorrow we're going to leave we'll go out in in the world and and Monday and Michael's got a new job with Amazon so pray for him see how they grown and moan when you say that and you know you don't deliver the package right yeah she better do it right the first time but I'm glad for all these younger folks that are getting jobs I tell um when I go to the cafe every morning for breakfast before I walk down to my first job at the post office they said where you going I said I'm going to work so you don't have to they said you just keep paying them taxes keep that check coming every month so but that's the cycle of everything going we see the cycle even here in in the church you know by the collie brother dirty they used to be the young ones now they're the older ones some of us used to be the younger ones now we're the older ones but we got a group of younger ones that are coming up that are that are really really uh to me they're outpacing a lot of us and I say us as far as wanting to be involved and to hear the word of God and be the word of God but that's the way it's supposed to be and that plan that God had he didn't the only time God had that plan to end was when the Rapture takes place and it doesn't matter then everybody's you know you're you're either staying here or you're leaving one of the two so there is a plan within with an N but but what does that end do that end just puts us into eternity where there is no beginning or no end so it's not an end like the end of life is coming it's an end of this that we see here now and it takes us into a Rapture and that's what we're looking at it's what we're looking for um uh brother Aaron will be doing Wednesday night service I'll if he doesn't see this I'll tell him um or let's just surprised him wouldn't you nobody say anything this coming Saturday at three o'clock we'll have the youth Service uh uh June I think they got some of the food we need we need some we're going to do some macaroni cheese and hot dogs and and slaw and stuff so please uh it's for everybody now it's not just for the Youth so everybody come it's regular service but it will be catered to the youth as far as sister Gabby is going to be doing stuff for the smaller ones and then we'll get together with brother Louise and brother Bob different ones for the for the bigger group and uh have something some kind of activity and then that will be brother Jack Duff he'll be with us really excited about hearing him I haven't heard him in a long long time except online a few times and then he'll do one Sunday service we'll not have two Services that'll be a service regular service on Sunday morning regular with Sunday school and all that and then now on the um 24th we know we're the ones that's going to the wedding we want to be praying for uh Esther and and Micah getting married in a couple weeks on Friday at two o'clock where some of us are planning to be there so we appreciate your prayers and we sure are going to pray for them and there's another new cycle of Life coming so there's there's a uh a group getting married now that uh that needs prayer with um coming up in this tough age also remember brother Sammy rest will be here then the next weekend on the 26th he'll be here both Services Sunday normal regular service and then also write down on your calendar April the 7th 8th and 9th that is Easter weekend we'll have a seven o'clock Friday night service brother Dutch Scott will be with us we'll have a Saturday fellowship meeting at three o'clock and that will be brother Chris long and then brother Chris long will be with us on one service for one service on Sunday which will be Easter Sunday so we covered your prayers pray for the meeting coming up pray for all these things pray for brother Jack Duff as he comes he ministers to us invite all the youth that you know anybody that's got youth at the church invite them to uh to come and be with us so we love you with the love of the Lord we thank you for all things that you do every piece that we like we were talking about today all the pieces that are missing in God's economy they will be filled because God's not going to have part plan he had a plan the plan is going to be fulfilled and every person that's in that plan is going to be in there you just got to make sure you know that you know that you know that you're fulfilling you're part of the plan all right instead of just we don't as Christians I was thinking the other day would uh we look at people and I know you do and you know people that that they just have no aim or no purpose in life don't know where they're going that's why they resort to alcohol drugs and all the different things is because they're fulfilling a desire to do something for a god right whatever you want to call it but listen we have a plan regardless of God we know the god oh that that has a plan and a purpose for us we just got to plug ourselves like I said this morning you gotta plug yourself into that and then say God what is it for me and then if it ain't if it's something you don't like you got to say hey listen Jesus did something he didn't like either he said father may this cup pass from me but nevertheless not my will but thy will be done sometimes we we sometimes we want to go this way and and we hit a snag or we hit a door or we hit something well God wants you to go in another Direction all right remember God's knows are the best yeses you'll ever have because he knows if he lets you go down and he'll let you go down that path he'll let you go down through there if you really really want to but boy you're going to really really mess up so I mess up enough I don't want to mess up intentionally I want the will of the Lord and that's what we need to pray for here is the will of the Lord for everything that we do all these brothers that we're bringing in and all these Services we have and the stuff we're doing for the Youth and stuff we're doing for each and every one we pray that we're building onto building on that and we're helping each other find your piece of the puzzle find your peace and your place to be so when we realize who we are what we're doing here will be an invincible Army I want to be an invincible Army I don't want to be something that the devil just beats me around all over the place all right amen think about that wouldn't that be wonderful you said well it will be when we get on the other side I think brother Brown said we're gonna have it on this side or we won't get it on the other side they won't be another side there'll be another side but it won't be the side you want to go to so let's make our decision here and know that we know that we know we know this is the correct message of the hour we know that it's it's it's it's that's what's going to change our body is the is the revelation of the message of the hour so let's just dig into that so let's bow our heads Lord thank you for this afternoon we appreciate you for all the good things that you've given us and as we sing songs Lord is just what a mighty God what a what a wonderful wonderful thing that that we have called the new birth it's you made manifest in another form called a bride and we are individuals but yet we're one unit Lord working together my finger is not the same as my toe but it has it's attached to the same body and it has a function to to keep my body going Lord so I pray Lord that the body of Christ will continue to build and keep going Lord in the admonition of the Lord and not in the world not look like the world not act like the world not be like the world but Lord would be more like you you gave us that promise you gave us an unconditional Covenant that you were going to have a bride and you were going to see this to the end and you know who's going to make it and who's not but we don't Lord but you're going to reveal to us I believe you revealed to each person in a part of their life what they're doing here and what their purpose is so I pray that that will be unfolded Lord and reveal to each and every one of us Lord I pray that you should be with ones that are sick the ones that are not with us the ones Lord that are sin sick father the ones that you know in and out of church and disappear and appear and and Lord just have all kind of issues and problems Lord may they find you may they find the Pavilion that they're supposed to get in and hide which is you father just be with us in a further minute service in Jesus name we pray amen it's not a man was on part 95. in the beginning was the word the word was with God and the Word was God and that word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth second Peter 1 says and besides this giving all diligence add to your faith now we've come to the place that we're adding to your faith now virtue and to Virtue knowledge into knowledge Temperance the temperance patience the patience and godliness and we'll get to it today just have patience but in your patience possess ye your souls you may be seated and then the next thing we're going to talk about is godliness I'll go and read the scripture that we're gonna that we're gonna kind of maybe if you want to study for the next week or so and without controversy now how much controversy do we have even in the message of the hour tons of it but without controversy great is the mystery of godliness that you and I can understand that a world can look at their self and say I never can be like God but God can look at us and say you got to be like me so then if you've got to be like me I got to make a provision because you're not like me from the birth but you are like me from the new birth so God was manifest In the Flesh here's his plan manifested in the flesh justified in the spirit saint of angels preached into the Gentiles praise the Lord that's me and you believed on in the world and received up into glory and then what'd he do he came back on the day of Pentecost in 120 in the upper room to start this Plan of Redemption all right now we know that that Noah Moses the ones we were talking about today David they're all a part of that Plan of Redemption but they are not the bride they do not get to live if they get to live in the city it's just going to be an honor for them you and I that's our home that's our domain that's our place to live that's our place we're going to and you can say that place is mine yeah man not be given to somebody else but that place is mine you say how do you know God built a wall around it God built a wall around it why keep them out that don't need to be in you say that sounds strange no it don't sound strange at all that's what God's always built walls right right oh yeah tear down walls turned out well but the walls that God builds he separates us right see you and I have walls in our house because we don't want people to know what's going on inside the house right but now the Bible says that our new house that the walls are going to be transparent so everybody is walking by can see what's going on in your house because it ain't full of sin and all these other things it's full of goodness but there's a group of people that's going to have to stay outside that wall of City because they didn't come to a place they're going to get to come in and partake of the glory but they're gonna have to walk right back out of that City on the other side of those walls all right we'll preach on that just maybe a year from now to the Lord willing I want to preach on that because they are walls and God God likes walls if they he builds them we build walls he builds walls that's why he built them see the walls of Jericho was built by a man and God said nope I don't want that to happen I'm going to destroy those but there's a wall he built with that City that's coming down out of Heaven has a brighter dorm for his husband it is so adorned it's got pearls it's got you can't even fathom the amount of money that's going to be inside that City that's not going to cost you one dime not gonna cost you one dime it's just you know what's going to cost us it's going to cost us living the truth no money at all I like brother Brown preach the sermon it'll be the sermon one time said without money and without price you can't put a price on it but you can't spend there's no money that can buy that there's no billions and billions and billions of dollars can get you inside that City only by the new birth which is the freest gift you can ever get if you'll accept it so now we're going to talk about any birth what do we adding we were talking about this morning when we look at the at the the the Plan of Redemption um somebody had a question today so I'm going to try to answer it weave it into the sermon um so you got justification sanctification and baptism of the Holy Ghost now that's taught in the Bible That's taught by most most message Believers not so much maybe uh the Baptist kind of goes into a little bit of that but they're kind of once saved always save you know shake a hand turn around if you don't ever come back to church if you got a letter and you're sending our file they're gonna they're gonna preachers they're gonna preach your funeral and preach into heaven because you were a member in good standing or any of the others but as bride as as the message Believers when brother Brown comes and preaches he doesn't preach a new New Birth he just takes the the new birth that the denominational world has and he puts it all together remember he's the one he's like the Elijah did with the the uh the altar they they had he repaired the altar in that Old Testament because the denominational 400 and something prophets had Beat It Down hadn't messed the whole thing up so here goes Elijah he puts it all back together well the lives in this day he put it together he put uh sister cleita had a conduct order and Doctrine book I I had not lost mine it's just packed up somewhere and uh I've been trying to get it out and find it but that's contradictory and Doctrine book just tells you every Doctrine and tells you everything how to how to how to ordain deacons how to how to you know vote for pastors how to how to do your job everybody why brother around sat down one day and he preached several sermons but then he also come down and put they compiled it conduct order and Doctrine so that whole book those two books tells us exactly how to act right thank God because it's not it's not a different book than the Bible it's telling you exactly what the Bible's saying through the mouth of a prophet that's why we believe that God sent us a prophet we believe the brother Brown was a prophet because the prophet gets it from God and gives it to the people he doesn't even since Cleveland and I were talking about she's been to she was at some of the sermons that brother Brown preached but you can tell where brother Brown says I don't know what I just said but it had to be the truth I don't know what I just said in other words my face my lips get numb I get numb all over he said we don't remember when he's in discernment because brother Brown didn't know them people well he so much was so so yielded to God he just in his in his you know he didn't step over like this inside of him he just yielded himself to this to the holy ghost that came down upon him and the Holy Ghost is the one that spoke because Holy Ghost is one knew what to talk about brother Brown would have made a horrible mistake himself if Peter not yielded to the Holy Ghost though he'd be a prophet though he be a church age messenger don't he be filled with the Holy Ghost and like she and I were talking about he had an anointing to preach and he preached the word of God and I believe that was the mouthpiece of God but now at the end of the sermon what would he say I'm waiting on him well where he been the whole sermon he was in a different office he was preaching the word of God to the people now I'm waiting on him to anoint me to get me out of the totally out of the way so that he can use my eyes in my mouth and speak to to tell people they're troubling you know so detailed you know there's a lot of people I've been watching on YouTube there's a I can't remember the guy's name uh Roth or somebody like that he goes and he you know he he analyzes brother Branham Jack Cole all the different ones and then they you know they come back I always come back to brother Brown because his was so Supernatural because you know even even Jack Cohn the different ones they'd say well somebody here has got a headache or somebody hears that they didn't do brother Branham he'd tell you that you went to the doctor yesterday he told that one woman he said I see you sitting on your couch looking out the window having a fainting spell well he is so detailed to where there's no way there it can be mental telepathy because that woman probably didn't even remember she was sitting on the couch don't remember that the the preacher I mean the preacher that the doctor had on a red coat yeah because he was but brother Brown was out of the move out of the way Holy Ghost come down and he would tell him exactly because he could see what was going on now you and I we're waiting on that same anointing now I don't discernment to stand up here and tell you what you're thinking right now I just don't want to do that the ones you laughed I wonder what you were thinking but I want the word to be the discerner the word's gonna the words what's going to tell us right and wrong always it's not going to be a man it's going to be the word of God that's going to do it so what to make up to make that all come to this here we look at the word we put the emphasis we know that justifications right sanctification back to the Holy Ghost but we've got to go on further we've got to go to the word of God brother Ram even says faith alone won't do it and I'll read you here in just a few minutes where brother random is talking about again that again he's not just all Faith you can have faith even Paul says you can have faith to move a mountain and have not the Newberg or charity you're sounding brass in a tinkling symbol boy you think that was you know that was pretty good if you could move a mountain how many of y'all ever done that that's what I thought so how Slack are we if we consider that as the scripture that we need to take right but we put emphasis on the word of God changing me first and you first and then all these other things are going to come because we're going to look at just a few minutes to where if that Ministry is not honed down to where it's just like Jesus's Ministry he walked and can't come on the scene you say no he can't but he will because he knows there's a group of people that did come to that place of the honing and and what are we doing now I mean are we knocking big pieces off I mean if people get born again yeah they're knocking you understand what I mean everybody understand what I'm saying with the sculptor he knocks big pieces off at first smoking drinking cussing running around uh put you whatever on it but then to find detail is where the real master Craftsman uses his craft to to make sure that the eyebrows and the eyelashes and the and the and the eyelids are in detail well what does that mean that means he has to be real close and real intimate he's not sitting there brother John he's not sitting there we went through all those times and we're still going through them now we bring evangelists in they come in with a hammer and a chisel yeah hello brother Bob some of them they come in with a hammer and a chisel and I mean big pieces go flying but give me just a little opportunity if they knock the big pieces off that I'm that I can maybe smoothly make the fingers look good and make the eyes look good and make you hair look good and all these other things for the detail part to me that's the word of God that you and I are looking at today the big pieces like I said before yeah young young people coming in the message but we should be the place now where God is doing the detail work and to me the detail work is this made manifest in you and me the detail work is having virtue like God knowledge like God tempers like God patience like God so brother Brown says what is it the Holy Ghost bunch is honing out so that it can what fit with the same kind of ministry so what are we looking for we we are looking at the same kind of ministry that Jesus had same identical Ministry that Jesus had now we saw a part of that in brother Branham he was standing do like Jesus did Jesus said I see you uh you know you have you told the truth you don't you've been married five times and the one you're living with is not your husband all right so brother Brown would almost do the same thing he would discern the thoughts and intents of the heart but then what happened with that gift though brother Brown said only one for a generation so we're not looking for a we're not looking for somebody to rise up and have the same gift brother random had in that form there's no way seventh angel messenger is gone but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel in the days of The Voice that comes from the as we were singing the song about the trumpet and all the different things when we were I was thinking you know you you see that that um that brother that wrote it Is Well with My Soul he talks about trumpet talks about the coming of the Lord talks about he was looking to that listen we're fulfillment of that anointing that he felt back in the 1800s when he wrote that song It Is Well with My Soul all those verses are being fulfilled and played out right now he was looking at it because the anointing was on him and God was helping him depend that or actually God was pending himself who in the world would have come up with a song The Days of Elijah in this day not 20 years ago not 50 years ago not a hundred years ago but today the updated Revelation is there's an Elijah on the scene that was not Elijah on the scene Back Then There Was Elijah on the scene now these are the days of Elijah and what a revelation that is that we can put ourselves in the Bible not only know that brother Brown was a prophet but know that you're sitting under that same anointing that he was under as far as being in an ego anointing in this seventh angel message under the messenger of Malachi 4 which we understand that's message of brother Branham all right but you and I have got a part we can't separate ourselves and say well that was just all for brother random and nothing for us you and I we've got to what bring it together before brother Brown says right here look the tree of life is growing again well listen if the tree of life is growing again it's got to be growing in something it's got to be growing in your Earth all right not going to do any good you know this is Springtime we're going to start planting our fruit trees we're going to start planting this tonight and the other that's fine but how about let's planting some Holy Ghost Inside of us how about us planting some some virtue and knowledge and Temperance and patience inside of us and let's get this thing growing right and then this morning we're talking about the seals and we'll get back to all that because because see when we get to the headstone and I'm gonna bring a little chart um the next time I preach and we'll break all that down again because see we're we're living in the age of the son of man but right now what I'm preaching to you right now is not the message of the son of man it's the message of the son of God because we're still in the church ages we're still bringing what was already preached what I'm preaching to you right now excluding the quotes that brother Branham verbatim quoted Bible and and and then preaching or giving you a commentary of what went on in history what we're looking at virtue wise was back two thousand years ago in Peter because Peter's Wonder wrote it Peter wrote it because that's what he was getting into that's what he was add to your faith virtue and all those tempers so I'm not preaching I'm not preaching something old but I am preaching something that's already been preached so that's the Son of God Revelation and that's going to get you the new birth it's going to make you a powerhouse it's going to make you do these things to make you live better you know Shine Your Light in Walmart not shining your other things in Walmart a lot of people trying other things in Walmart but it'll make you act different but that's not the headstone that's not the message of the son of man the message of the son of man is a message that never hit the Earth until now like it was two thousand years ago because that's quote I just gave you right here the Holy Ghost Bunch honed out so that it can fit with the same kind of ministry look and not the ministry of the church ages the ministry he had when he went away that's two thousand years ago that's the same Ministry he had that when he comes back he's here when he comes back it'll catch the whole thing in a Rapture who's the whole thing you me all right we're the Justified Sanctified baptism of the Holy Ghost that pyramid will stand again the house of God will live again the tree of life is growing again that's what we've got to believe that we're part of it we're not looking to see it come we are living it today and let's not miss our day of visitation nothing between my soul and my savior nothing feelings emotions yeah that's all good but you can get sure tied up and all that but when you become the word made flesh you look at Jesus Jesus never screamed Jesus never hollered right he had authority to empower because he had all these virtues he didn't have them working in him he was them right and that's the same way with me and you we got to have these virtues and they're a requirement for us to have we are made partakers of his Holiness we In His Image we are living images of a living God now listen when Jesus walks up to a mirror and looks in the mirror he sees who himself right when you walk up in front of the mirror if you're gonna look like the Living God you're gonna look like Jesus Christ you said that's weird no it's not weird that's what he just said right here we are living images because God gave us a mandate back in the eternities in Genesis 1 26. he said let us make man in our own what image and our own likeness and let them have dominion over the face of the sea and foul the air and everything that creepers and runneth all and walketh all over the Earth we are living images of a living God then dead to self raised with him now listen listen to this so listen listen to this his word made flesh again in US oh brother Neville what is it not the mythical imaginary God sitting out there but the Living God what is the Living God the word in you makes itself real the word in you not the word in here not to not the millions of translations not the different Doctrine but the word in you he said glory to God I know you think I'm a Holy Roller it was hard for them people to swallow some of that but the word of God which is God is made flesh in you why you're seated in Heavenly places triumph over all things in Christ Jesus well listen we got to get out of that outer Court you've got to get into the inner Court in the holy of holies you stay in the outer court and you're going to have bad days and good days sunny days and rainy days but see if you've already been into the inner Court there's one thing for sure if you have to come back out you know how to handle it a lot better than you did when you were standing out here when you first walked into the court I always say that I hope we see that we're going to have bad days and good days I'm not saying they alleviate themselves but it helps because you gotta what overcome them some some people can't overcome their bad days they just have them in a row quit having them in a row it's your fault if you do God's not gonna make keep you in that funk that you're in you keep yourself in it that's because negative confession I can't this and I can't that remember God cannot deal with unconfession he don't know how to do that for a negative confession he can't deal with it right and if you keep it inside of you he can't deal with it either because you got to make profession you got to profess what you're believing inside of you all right as we go through this statue of perfect man it's not just to to say well well here's here's virtue Donnie now here this this is all you need all you need for verse you're here there you go that's it no it's everything it's this whole building it's this whole town whole Community whole universe so we can preach on justification sanctification by baptism the Holy Ghost never get away from one God never get away from the seals never get away from anything because that's the plan of redemption so that's what we're trying to speak on today is getting on up this statue but we got can't do it while we're still down here deep calls into the deep that was another question today somebody asked you got to remember there are three kinds of Believers in a church all right there's the the full full believer there's the mate believer and there's your unbeliever all right now that's what the prophet of God said so so we have to deal with that and as ministers that's like brother Dale's always you know he's kind of I asked you one time that's how you deal with these people he said well I just pretty much he didn't say this exact words but he said I just preached that they're all good and then they got to decide whether they're bad or not because I can't keep saying well you're bad you're bad you're no you didn't decide whether you're bad or not all right because I believe we've had the word of God preached to us and like I told you several times I'll tell you again we've had the revelation of the message of the hour what are we doing with it what are we doing with it are we setting it well you put it under our rear end and we sat down on it or are we using it using it against the devil because the only thing that the use Jesus had all kind of power when the devil walked up to him and gave him three different things to to tempt him with what did he do he said it is written how many times when we get into an issue and we say Lord didn't you say or either say Satan it is written right here in the Bible I'm going to resist you and you've got to flee from me you know what that's too simple we want to do something we want to get our special book out or our special tape or read our special sermon or watch our special preacher on the internet well praise the Lord anyway but there's True Believers make Believers and unbelievers let's just cover that just for a minute because the question was like coming to church you know the desire the deep that caused to the Deep I'll promise you one thing's for sure according to the word of God a Believer will always be in church everybody with me a May believer comes because I'm going to call them something I'm going to call them something else if they don't that's a May believer I say I whoever I'm not the only one preaching them coming to church everybody preaching on coming to church because you know what a True Believer come to church so the main Believers say exactly that it's a make-believer they make believe that they believe in what you think that they're believing but an unbeliever just don't come to church and they're just they just don't believe that it's doing them any good so they stay out of church so that's an unbeliever so you got your good your True Believers which will always come to church then you've got your make-believers which will come every once in a while all right then you got the ones that just are unbelievers and that's just why they're called unbelievers they don't believe that the Bible's right they don't believe that every promise is for them they don't believe that paying tithes will give you or will pour out a a gift from Heaven from God that you can't contain they don't believe that coming to church is important so they're unbelievers and who made them that they did right but we we need to and and there's no way that we can say well Michael's a believer in June's an unbeliever and listen to make believe that's not for I don't stand here and judge that doesn't neither I don't think another Minister stand here and just just judge I'm gonna tell them Lily we had suffered with him last night and she says she just has a hard time getting up and coming to church she just has a hard time getting here early so but but she was saying she was she she was saying I she says I just know every time you say that said you're said you I feel this finger right here between my eyes it's a bullet hole not my finger but do you feel that way when the preacher's preaching to you about anything I'm not talking about just coming to church anything I do but see brother there when he hit me when he was preaching all the time he didn't just hit me between the eyes my head hit the ground went rolling I had to you know like a bowling ball that winter went awry we hadn't picked that bowling ball up and take it back on top of my head you know why though because there's something inside of me that wants to do better because an unbeliever said I really don't care what you say preacher I ain't coming to church that's an unbeliever all right but a True Believer has got a desire or a deed that calls out that says hey I got to do better not that I got to I want to do better listen I want God to be able to fulfill his promise if he said I'll pour out of a blessing on you you can't contain brother John I'm gonna make sure my tithe gets paid first he tells us for Satan not assembling us self together brother Brian quote direct quote brother Brown said you can't wait till those doors open to come in and fellowship not with each other but with God okay and then he does tell us to be there 30 minutes before the service starts so that we can worship and get clean clean yourself up you know get all that stuff pushed away from you and listen to the song service and pray there is something behind what what brother Brown tells us if you look in that conduct order and Doctrine book I'm just going to preach a little bit you're looking at contractor and Doctrine book brother Brown didn't put that in there just because it was his his thought or idea all of it was biblical he took things that maybe we we think well maybe that's not too important but brother remember bring it out said no this is important and this is where you need to place it that's what a true Prophet does he places he takes it like a jigsaw puzzle you know you throw the pieces out all over the house that's what man's done with the word of God they just drove to Pieces all over the house and then brother Branham by the anointing of God not by his own anointing but by the anointing of God he takes and puts peace together just where this has got to go and this is I was like we were talking about last night they won't ever invite me in June back over again but lately now we were talking about she's like me you know you're going to do it because I told you to do it right because I'm the mama or I'm the daddy oh I want to know why tell me why I got to do that why because I said so no well same thing with God now he's that way in a way but he wants to tell you why he's a loving God that's why there's not just Ten Commandments written in this Bible that's why there's a lot of this stuff in the Bible and all the in-between stuff is to show us why he said no you can't do this why he said because if you take the forsake assembling yourself together you can just say well that's what Paul said or that's what brother Brown said what's in the Bible if God was if it was important enough for him to put in the Bible it's important for us to reap the benefits from it and that's our issue folks I'm telling you I can tell people that don't pay times I can tell people don't come to church all the time you fight and struggle all the time there's a problem somewhere there's an issue there's a blah blah blah blah blah just whatever you want to put in there you're not settled well I don't believe you've become an unbeliever I don't believe I have to do that well okay then you're leaving that unbelieving part but you see how this is we shouldn't be talking about this this far up the road but we do we have to because it reminds us and it keeps us from being Slack because Satan would love for us to just be Slack he's a slacker himself and he just wants us to be Slack but have you ever had a back to Lily and Zach Lily was uh it was good food probably never get it again but that was good we'll invite you at our house next time and then you can talk about that you can get up here and talk about us okay I'm not talking to you Zach I'm talking to Lily yeah but but lately was and and Lily was telling the story about how that you know her and she had a boyfriend in the past and and that she was really was hurt by him and she was you know almost turning away from the message right almost turning away from the message because of the hurt and the pain but she said then I saw Zach and let me tell you about I'm gonna give you a star now Zach what did she see she didn't see that black she saw somebody that treated her different acted like Christ around her and when that was an issue what did Zach say Lily let's pray let's read our Bible together the Lord brought you back through Zach and then you know what you got to marry him what a bonus praise the Lord but that's the way it works with God when there's a real true courtship that's the same as you and God getting to know each other that's the same as getting married and becoming a new Christian and and not knowing everything but but but what happened with us our our husband got us out of all the junk that we were fixing to get in we were fixing to turn away right but we saw something different saw something different and there was a what there was something inside see Lily didn't know as Lily was walking through the issues that she had she didn't know that there was a Zack there but when Zach came in front of her I'm making a point here but when Zach came in front of her and I think Josiah was the one that kind of put them together and they saw each other's picture and uh blah blah blah anyway make you sick but um when you see that that's the same way it was with the Lord I mean there's a desire to do right there's a desire to love something inside of you but you don't know exactly what his name is but then when that person is put in front of you oh that's why oh that's why I love him so much he's so cute he's so sweet he treats me good well then that's the way it should be with the Lord have you ever felt if you could take that and transfer that to the feeling you have with God of God because he's your husband he's your lover right we're supposed to love him more than we love our spouse but that's a real good analogy that there's a deep sitting there that's called Jesus Christ The Life of Christ we just don't know it we go to justification sanctification but boy when we come into the intimacy of the new birth we get to know him that much more we get to live with him we get to be with him we get to talk to him I know if this is boring you then you ain't born again but that deep is calling to a deep that was inside of you yeah we know that it wasn't some seed laying there that was eternal we know it's not that but there was something in man that wanted to love a god remember bro didn't Brothers say he put that desire in you to worship and love something right so you just didn't know his name yet you didn't know his name was that black did you but oh boy when you're dead one more time she got love sick and didn't want to be healed [Laughter] they're just the cutest couple but you know I want I want the bride and and Christ to be the same way the cutest couple that ever lived knows each other intimately knows each other in their like I said the deepest call when that deep calls there's a deep to respond so Lily had a deep for a a good Christian man you know what there he was there was the Deep to respond the part to respond to that deep call that she had a desire that she wanted to have a boyfriend and she wanted to have a husband that was our desire now that's the same way with me and you do you have that because brother Ryan said look before there can be a deep there has to be a deep to respond to it so there had to be a Zack black here oh listen we ain't putting here just for nothing I'm telling you even in the natural you better thank God if you got a Godly wife for a Godly husband some can't say that before there can be a deep call that had to be a deep to respond so listen before we started this series on the Statue of perfect map or even before brother Branham started this series on the Statue of perfect man there was something laying there in why do you not want to be closer to God why do you not want to be closer to you mate why are you not want to be closer to you love her as you people a few years ago who probably were Sinners maybe you were in some formal church that didn't believe in the baptism of the Holy Spirit but you heard the message there was something in there called out for what more of God not just God more of God to me this is more of God you might have been living in a Justified State before God but you wanted the baptism of the Holy Spirit and you hungered for it I want to ask you a question little church have you ever just hungered for the baptism of the Holy Ghost I did because I knew I didn't have it and I knew how I was supposed to act when I did get it because I was taught well so I had a background you've got a background you can't say I don't know how to act it's been explained over and over again in detail how it's supposed to make you act but you wanted the baptism of the Holy Spirit and you hungered for it now the very reason that there is a holy spirit is because you were hungering for him the very reason you ought to be a better have more knowledge of God are more Temperance are more patience is because there's more to get all right amen there's more to get but he's going to put us in an evil age he's going to put us in the worst time he's going to put us in the uh Michael he's putting us in the worst time there ever was right but now remember the Wright brothers didn't go up in the first rocket everybody understand what I'm talking so many older people know Google it who the Wright brothers are the Wright brothers are the first one that that um I think Joyce was there with him in the plane in 19 about 1917 . no around 1900 they weren't they going to build a flying machine so they put together this piece of wood and these pedals and this turning thing and they go to Kitty Hawk North Carolina and they get on this big Bluff you know flat place and then here's there's a real place that sings way down and they decide that man can fly if they can just put everything together just right so guess what they did they boy they you know Orville and Wilbur they're once pushing and the other ones you know chugging along chugging along and here they go and man I think the first flight only lasted a couple of minutes before they crash landed that was a beginning that was you wanting more of God put you in a vehicle and you that was vehicle was okay because out of that came what came to planes with the duel um you know the the ones in 1917 during the war then by the time the next war came up they had a airplane that could shoot guns and and fly 600 miles an hour all right Orville Wilber weren't on that one then you come up to now where they're putting them in Rockets now and sending them places and bringing the same rocket back that used to not be when we were growing up they wasted billions of dollars when we were growing up because you put the big rocket up this one fell over here and went into the water and this one they needed for so much oxygen and not so much power to do this you understand what I'm saying that's the same way we are in the word of God what if Orville and Wilbur would have said we can't fly or to them to and transported them into 2023 and send them over to Elon Musk and they said we want to fly that thing disaster so they had to grow that's why you and I we had to grow and God put us in the worst time but I believe he saved the best for last he put us in the worst time for a purpose to prove what to prove to Satan that we can get it done that we cannot just fly 20 or 30 feet that we can fly talk listen talk about where that came from in 1900 I don't know what year it was maybe 1906 or whatever it was somewhere in there where that was just a piece of paper to where now we get in them and I can fly from here to the Philippines if you ever just fathom how man took one piece of equipment that that held one person a hundred years ago all right 100 and something years ago and then now we can fly from here to the Philippines with 450 people on board have a double decker with thousands of pounds of luggage underneath thousands of pounds they fed us three meals a day for 400 and some people so that's how many meals they had to store in that airplane brother John then they had to put enough fuel to keep me in the air for 19 hours and the engines you know there's several of them but they're only about that big around but they got so much force why technology now if man has progressed to that group to that part what about God that's why he had to send an astronaut in the end time call Brother Brown they could take us up and that we could handle the what Brethren said we are pressurized for this job you and I are pressurized for what's going on today we may think and like I said before quit looking at the mixed multitude not everybody is Israel not everybody is bride listen I'm not going to separate them brother Dale's not going to separate them and the brothers are not going to separate them you'll separate yourself as I was telling sister Regina Noah preached 120 years and God had him build a boat stood at the door the prophet said and preached I'll read if I get to it it may not get to it preached 120 years standing at the door of the Ark and only eight people went in but I'll promise you there was a Congregation of thousands standing around Noah listening to what he had to say that never made it God is a separator folks we can soft soap this thing and you can pet your babies and you can pet your wife and you can pet your husband all you want to there's a day brother round said there's a day coming when God's going to shut that door and then whatever decision you made you're going to deal with it whether you're outside or inside I've always always you know God shut the door no it didn't God shut the door so Noah didn't say well now it's time for me to shut the door no God just said get in the ark today I'm shutting the door he didn't give him a heads up he'd been giving 120 years a heads up and he when he shut that door remember it was pitched inside and out with tar I promise you when that water started coming up and The Fountains of the deep start opening up and California Saints everybody with me there was nail prints from people trying to crawl up that Ark didn't happen they didn't get in God's provided way they didn't go through the door think about that virtue knowledge Temperance now we're we're Temperance Temperance is self-control we talked about a little bit this morning it's mastering our desires and passions and we don't have that just not that's just not sexual okay come on people we have desires for other things that we passions that we like I said before it's real strange to me I'm hold on I'm on my box now it's real strange to me how that you ladies can shop all day all day hours make sure you're on time and be happy while you're shopping brother John say today and be real ecstatic when you come home with deals you spent how long to get them deals did you take a nap that was so exciting we had something did you go to the bathroom no I just got so cold up here that I didn't go to the bathroom for four or five hours can't sit in here for an hour and a half didn't watch a movie for three hours and never move and be happy about it by your words and your actions you will be justified in by your words and your actions you will be condemned we used to go to football games and we'd sit there watch the Georgia Bulldogs play Never Move never move a muscle be just as happy to jump up and down shout and scream I'd rather do this now self-control the virtue of one who Masters look Masters his desires listen it's all right to shop that's saying one thing against it all your sisters are like no do I shop all you want to but don't shop so much until you shop on Saturday and then Sunday you don't come to church hello somebody Regina keep smiling you're good you're good back there but once that's what you're desire and your passion is what is your desire surprise but you master it or control it or look curb it restraining controlling oneself temperate continent brother remember I said tempers doesn't mean stop drinking alcohol all right it means what Holy Spirit Temperance is what controlling your temper not flying off when everybody speaks somebody when a preacher tells you need to be in church because if you don't come that crosses you every time you say something about even even when we're you talk to somebody out in the world brother Donnie's done it you talk to somebody and you're talking this good Baptist guy and you're talking to him you're talking to him about the Lord Lord's great he died on the cross and he come to save us and brother Donnie says now is that three of them or one of them yeah which one of them you he gets there gets their attention and their righteousness indignation your daddy was the best of them but what it was he's telling them the truth and that truth wasn't in them there was a part truth but it wasn't all the truth they believe in the Lord Jesus Christ but do they believe he's one God oh they believe he's the second person of a trinity boy a lot of us are going to fall off before we get started aren't we then we wonder why God is not in his church doing Miracles and things that they used to do yes sir Temperance says how to answer in kindness when wrathus spoke to you somebody says you bunch of Holy Rollers don't jump up and down and roll your sleeve up now but talk with Godly love Temperance kindness is that the way you want to be in the congregation says amen when you're riled up round up back let him be your example if you still blow up in Fast and fuss and stew and carry on uh-huh you ain't got no you can't add that because it won't add it won't vulcanize can't take Rubber and vulcanize it to Iron same kind of Holy Ghost Temperance that he had then it will vulcanize with him you're added it too let's just keep going on when you can really have Sweetness in your heart forgive every person hold your peace let it be gone I mean can we do that I mean I know as a human being and as as we struggle through this and it is a struggle we struggle through this it's contrary to all of our nature that we were growing up with when you were a little boy what was your nature do it to me I'll do it to you and if I can I'll do it to you worse than you did it to me all right we used to you know use the Golden Rule used to be doing to others as you do they do unto you well the golden rule we had was to do it to others and run real fast but that's the way it was human nature we always want to get back at the person that does us wrong well get quiet would you but it's exactly what you grew up with but when you can really with Sweetness in your heart forgive every man hold your peace let it be gone then it will vulcanize you can add that to your faith all right and vulcanization you all know it can't be it can't be reversed because once listen once God hit I want to ask you a question everybody's sitting here today is in some form of uh the new birth may I say either in justification sanctification baptism Holy Ghost some are way up to Pyramid some are in different sections and some of us are struggling some a lot of us are you know worried that we can't do this or this is going to be really hard but have you since we've been starting this though have you had something come to your attention that hadn't come to it before because see that's the way I feel that God works with me I don't know about you but but I'd be sitting there and when my growth would happen right there where brother Donnie said that's where I sat the whole time when brother Dale was preaching well he would bring things out and I would have that moment of number one I need to work on that our number two thank you Lord because that part of me is gone see that's what we need to hone in on either one both is that have I got better with this or have I got worse with this have I got better has people been able to talk to me more and I have more knowledge not in the knowledge of the world but knowledge of the word of God [Applause] our virtue virtue is power strength listen and I know we have our little idiosyncrasies we have our little things that that that I my whole thing is is grapes your cheese some people just grate my cheese Pastor some people just grate my cheese I'm just I just called your name to say that I was not talking to you okay all righty then but still that's human nature but can you buy your Christian experience push that aside and not tolerate people but love them so much you want to be around them see as a as a as a as a um a sinner I didn't want to be around my dad because there was condemnation there right I mean you felt it I felt we all did not your daddy your your daddy who bro Tom you know it was one of them where you went way around you went 285. to get around brother Tom because you knew what was going to happen he wasn't going to harass you he was just going to tell you the truth and I didn't want the truth at that time because remember the Bible says the truth wasn't in me but there was a time when it's like you said before he said he said you're going you're coming you're coming but see The Virtue that was being put forth from him and from brotherdale and different ones that I didn't want to be around them because I didn't have that same virtue but now that I have that same virtue that I'm trying to do better trying to know trying to know that God is in brother Dale different ones that's why I have listen Chris long and all those people they're not just my friends we feed off each other hope is good right because I feel that Chris has virtue brother um Scott has a virtue brother um altique has virtue so I want to draw strength off of that I don't want to shun them and not be around them because whatever's inside of them supposed to be in me and we're supposed to what then that's it then that's virtue that is strength that has been able to draw strength you sisters some of you go through issues and problems and some of you already been through them all right like I said before you gonna go talk to the guy at the convenience store about your salvation no you're gonna find a sister in the church you're gonna find somebody to talk to that may and this is where one thing we've got to see that all of us are not strong all of us are just not strong at the same level right we're all in different even even men and sisters were all strong in certain points but let's start look compacting let's start putting that together though not separating it apart let's start putting it together and feed off of each other and you'll feel listen You'll Know real quick whether it's good food or bad food if that's what your desire is is to have good food I know like look at sister Trudy they're Trudy McMillan she's 80. 80 150. 85. 85 years old she's one of the oldest ones in the building she drove four hours hmm every service I'm getting there I'm preaching four hours I'm gonna hand you your crown four hours every service every service does that from North Carolina now that means you had to leave it like then you leave it like five o'clock in the morning six in the morning some of y'all were still catching your z's at eight o'clock this morning just because you told me that's when you're gonna wake up right well see she's already got ready now that's she's got to get ready then she's got to get in the car then she's got to drive four hours [Applause] 85. to come where here and not be here 30 minutes late be here on time she's 85. God's give her a long time gave her a good life long life he's honored what she did but where did she draw virtues she didn't draw version I'm not saying anything about anybody up in North Carolina where she lived where did she draw virtue from she drawed virtue from the ministry of brother Dale she'll tell you that okay so then that desire that deep Drew her here that deep not in deep of anything up that deep she wanted more deep teaching she wanted more she wanted more uh word than she was getting where she was at well she deserved then that she was it didn't matter the four hours that she drove one way because obviously folks if she drove four hours down here she's got to drive four back it wasn't a magical thing you drive four hours you flew back how many times sister how many times did you really break down on the side of the road I remember one time you finally the car uh blew up it had like 600 million thousand miles on it by Volvo we have one it'll get you where you're going you didn't have a flat tire I don't think at all did you no hold on people how many years was that 20 years at least 20 years okay let's just say 20 years how many of y'all been 20 years without a without a flat tire oh but you didn't drive 220 miles one way every Sunday oh no set of tires in that car with that motor in that car and we live 10 minutes from I'm not going there y'all just know what I'm talking about but you know what she'll rise up and condemn this nation she'll condemn some of you for the desire that she had because she Drew virtue I mean listen think about it 20 years 220 miles one way 220 back every Sunday and have no car problems but one time the poor old thing finally kicked up and the motor blew didn't break down a Time on the side of the road isn't that kind of odd isn't that kind of almost miraculous and that kind of almost like brother like brother Lord the Lord Jesus was taking care of her oh she was never alone either yeah you had a pilot with you yeah but you understand what I'm saying I'm not trying to I'm not trying to shame you I'm letting her do it but she got to desire of her heart she's she's become a stronger Christian because of it miraculously like I said before you ask a truck driver if he's driven 440 miles just in one day one day and not had trouble with his car truck whatever and she had none except the one like I said one time the motor blew up had like 300 and some thousand miles on it finally he gave out listen we still live in this world things give out all right but look at the protection because she did what God honored her faith God honored that she wanted more of God she was that deep call came from right here came from this ministry here and then I believe that she's she well she asked sometimes she asked some questions that that that most preachers couldn't answer right she had not got knowledge at 85. you kids that's where you already get a lot of your knowledge from y'all not get it from somebody same age older because they've been there done that drove the miles been hurt been pushed been pulled scarred not wanting you to be scarred to be scarred well I don't know why okay I just wants to feel this we're not feeling these virtues we're just talking about them they're on a piece of paper or something brother Dale says you need to do that's not what it ought to be it ought to be where you live it it all debated where I can point to Sister Trudy and say she lived it Amen brother Dale he lived it I wanted what he was living I didn't want to be like Daddy I can't be like that don't y'all ever think I'll be like him he's an individual as far as a human but I want what he had because you know what I wanted to be able to act the way that he acted all them guys in General Motors they'll tell you that didn't act no different here than he did down there and that's what they saw can they see that in me and you in our job workplace and all that well praise the Lord from whom the whole body fitly joined see that's what the shaking is this church needs to be shook all of us need to be shook because you know what shaking does shaking will get you compacted it'll get you where all the air comes out of that the whole body fitly joined and compacted by that which every joint supplies according to effectual working in the measure of every part makes it increase the body into the edifying of itself in love have you ever looked at the body of different things I may not get to all this but we'll this this is good enough for me you know we as human beings our bodies built to stand upright everybody with me our body's not built to crawl now we start crawling but our bodies made to stand upright all of our can you imagine how many how much pressure is on your ankle bones right now especially mine you don't have to laugh you skinny people Godly jealousy but really it but God made those things just right to where they'll handle your weight and if you even move over to this side or move over to this side you're still standing up your low your toe muscles ain't much bigger than than this right here than a pencil but that's your structure that keeps you standing upright wow and you take something like a deer a deer doesn't see we do like this a deer's reverse his knees go down first so you know what God did God give him some really strong hand muscles that he Springs up when he when something comes like when you scare a deer he don't get up like we do he gets up from the back first and then he when he does he Springs forward because his arms see we can't even do that because his elbows bend the other direction but that was he was made for that that was made for him to be in Flight real fast to get out of the way to get out of the danger and you know for one thing you know how a deer jumps and can jump like eight ten feet and I mean they're jumping I mean they're it don't bother him a bit do you know their front legs are not even attached to their skeletal body rap bro you skin a deer out and you cut his arms off all you do is cut the meat off and you're done he didn't is like see we're connected all of our skeletons we're connected together but a deer's not because if it was he'd break his shoulder every time he'd jump so God made him with shock absorbers to where his to wear his bones would never break no matter how much pressure he puts on it while he jumps and jumps away from danger what are you saying by the way God built this body right God's going to build his body of Believers right he's going to have the right kind of people it doesn't matter if that little bone you know they always say if you get your big toe cut off that you lose your balance that thing ain't but about well some may be way bigger than that but but your big toes only about like this but if you get cut it off it affects your whole body affects your whole balance same way with me and you when some of y'all are not in church when some of y'all are going through struggles it hurts the whole body it hurts it hurts brother Dale and the different ministers not having to get on to you for the things you do it hurts us it's not something we we're not sadists we don't love it we hate it because we know the devil's involved and we always don't like that guy but we love the body of Christ which every joint supplies according to the facial work in the measure of every part making increase of the body what edifying it in love that word compacted is as we were talking about this morning to knit together to cause to do that word right there which is joined together put together unite or knit together in affection to cause a person to unite with one in a conclusion or come to the same opinion to prove demonstrate to teach and instruct that's what we've been doing we've been teaching you could tolerate the devil he's going to be there Temperance is self-control if you didn't have a contrast there would be no temperance think about that because why would you need temperance if it was all God you need Temperance because there's a devil there and it's opposition now I know sometimes we get mad at ourselves but boy how many times you get mad at yourself or get mad at somebody else oh yeah it's always somebody else's fault and it's his problem or hers they started it they caused me to get mad no they did not cause you to get mad you cause yourself to get mad but Lord help me with self-control me you and all of us to control the things that we can control him if you can't control it guess what give it to God Hannah's quitting smoking and I appreciate all of you on what's out there praying for that finally she's come to a place to where she might be sick and tired of being sick and tired all right but she had to come to a place that she didn't want to do that anymore but I'm telling you it's been Hell on Wheels she's had diarrhea she's been throwing up she can't eat she can't sleep why her body was so used to that and that demon of smoking was just so happy he loves for you and I said yesterday no day four yesterday she was sitting eaten and I said how you doing I walked by I said how you doing I just looked at her like that she had food all in her mouth she said this is good she said I can taste my food now right some of you that smoked you know that it kills your taste buds why would you want to smoke I like to eat and taste my food but she said man this guy so you look you see that even even though I know there's something calling inside of her but she's not a Christian but there is a something for her wanting to do better what are you saying brother wait he [Applause] I don't like myself for some of the things I do you shouldn't like yourself either but that's the ones you want to get rid of then you want people to realize it we realize now that Hannah's not smoking she does not smell like smoke she don't have a pack of cigarettes laying all over the place what she's changed he said well I don't smoke there's something on your list that you need to quit doing that I need to quit doing all right so those of you that don't pray for us that do amen give you something to pray about since you're perfect praise the Lord but we all have our thing and and to me that's what I was trying to think about how to approach this and I'm not getting the patience but trying to approach it in a way that that that when we preach it well you know and and let me give you an example brother Dale in 1982. bear with me just a minute brother Dale in 1982 preached on the seals to me that's the greatest revelation of the Seven Seals that's ever been since brother Brown came on here man it's 67 tapes that you and two if you don't we've got them somewhere that was in 1982. now listen the world wasn't ready for it the Believers in the message were not ready for him not at that time it was a different time but God revealed them to him so that he could build us all a base so that we can know what we're talking about that we can know that the seals is not just a white horse rider the red horse rider and the black horse rider and the fifth seals to the Jews and the six seals to the two witnesses and seventh seals nice to me and you why would the seals be opened by a gentile Prophet if it wasn't for a gentile Church amen and they were open so in 1982 he preached them okay so they went out because I'm gonna read you this right here second talk about patience and then we'll talk talk about it later he had patience because a lot of people would have maybe preached those and said well bless God don't buy under nobody wanted to know here nobody understood nobody wanted to you know there was no response it's just always flat and uh maybe it wasn't of God maybe you know this and that and the other and we put all of our whatevers into it but God left it there and then he he brother Dale moved on started preaching other things that was 1982 folks how many of y'all were even born in 1982. some of you weren't even here boy don't raise your hand you wouldn't hear nothing you'd hear knocking these two I mean on the Earth ain't talking about in this church boys like pray for patience Janet Janet probably well nevermind I ain't gonna talk about age all right so and this is how God works and that's the way he works with me and you not just put the seals in there not just bringing out the Revelation but your life there's certain things that you do and you say man God I wish everybody could see this that's what brother they'll wish everybody could see what he saw in 1982 but it wasn't time it wasn't time for that so he had what the characteristic of a man who has not swerved from his deliberate purpose and his loyalty to Faith and piety by even the greatest trials and sufferings patiently and steadfastly what if Peter said that's it I'm done if ain't listening to me I'm just going to quit that would have been 40 four years ago from 1982 till now sorry Danny 41. look what we would have lost if he'd just said I ain't having patience with them if they didn't get it the first time I'm done with it no then about 1992 he preached them again somewhere in the 90s then in 2000 something he preached him again then just several years ago he preached on him again you know why for me and you he had patience he had patience that God was going to reveal it to a group of people that had not got there yet but he had patience that we'd get here and I believe we're here I believe we're here I believe we're able to hear it I believe we're able to not just hear it but respond to it and build from it steadfastness constancy endurance do you know that patience the word patience is not even in the Old Testament it doesn't begin until the New Testament look it up look in your concordance the word patience didn't show up until the New Testament wasn't in the Old Testament because without the Holy Ghost it's hard to have patience anybody with me Moses didn't have any did he David didn't have any did he you look at all them people that got impatient and did the wrong thing uh steadfast waiting for it I just put that waiting for what waiting for me waiting for you but now folks I'm telling you if you're waiting for the bus to pull up and you're at the bus station and you've got your ticket for the bus it will be there and you will get picked up so I know there's a story of not having the right ticket and be at the plant no there is a group of people that's going to buy the right ticket at the right time and that bus that they're supposed to get on is going to pull up and you're going to have your ticket ready oh my how many people have I mean flying now is just a I hate flying is I don't hate flying in the air it's the getting there getting through security huh same way with with us there's some things that we don't have patience for but it's worth something because I wouldn't want to get on an airplane now without having to go through TSA because there's a bunch of idiots out there that won't blow planes up still okay so I'll just uh I'll just endure that because actually the next thing we're going to talk about is patience is called endurance those who endure to the end shall be saved those who endure the Bible tells us followers of them who through faith and patience inherit the promises and we'll get to something read and we'll back up here in just a minute the trying of your faith worketh patience but let patience have her perfect work that you may be perfect and entire wanting nothing brother Brown said you're beginning to reflect the works of Christ we'll go through it real quick musicians come on right here it is right here this I want to read this right here now this is in Statue of perfect man listen brother Brown tells us he's talking about having patience but so many of us trying to do the works of Christ before the reflection of Christ is in US now there's the trouble we find these things happening you know it I know it we see these stumbles along the road we find the scrap heap of Ministers of Christians piled along the road is because they didn't go into it right we see these stumbles along the road we find the scrap heap of ministers what's he talking about we're on a path we're walking we're doing we're doing we're doing what God Said and then Here Comes somebody out past the will of God you finally meet him on the road and they're piled up racked on the side of the road because they didn't go according to God's plan we find the scrap heap of Ministers of Christians piled along the road is because they didn't go into it right and that's why I'm here this morning to try to teach this little church and myself how that we can become the dwelling place of the Living God how many would like to be that way let's stand to our feet The Dwelling Place of the Living God then he talks about us being long-suffering you know that's that all that and endure those who those who what those who endure to the end shall be saved well I can only make it so far well is that your confession no I confess I'll make it to the end I confess we all Buy growing in God we're going to make it and God give us a provision to grow you know man man has not come they're so close to God because their requirement of us to be as we were talking about electricians and and Elisha had to go to church I had to go to church had to go to school if you're if you have a degree today any kind of degree it's because you went to a school right right if you have a degree in anything some of you are trying to get one some of you are but is there not a requirement of things you got to do you just don't you just don't call on the phone and say hey I'd like a degree in electrical work and they send you one guess what you're gonna die I will anyway because I don't know what's hot and what's not and I'll grab both of them and I'll beat the 440 and get a body change but what did you do you went to school 12 long years and then if you wanted to go further you had four two or four long years and if you want to be a doctor you can tack on about another four to six on top of that then you begin to be a doctor well that's what me and you have come to a place to be the PowerHouse of God we got to go through the curriculum we got to do what God told us to do we've got to become what brother Brown told us is a Powerhouse of God power without character though is satanic this is the character so power with this character we know how to handle Satan when he walks up we know how to handle God when he wants you to do something we know how to handle our neighbor we know how to handle everything you say oh I don't know if I can do it well that see you stopped yourself you become an unbeliever at that time I just believe I just believe that we can do it I just believe that we're going to do it somebody there's going to be somebody standing in time and say death I don't know who you are I know what you are and I know you have no power over me there's no funeral home there's no uh there's no um embalming fluid there's nothing that there's nothing on this Earth that's going to cause me to need you right well nobody said y'all get quiet well then I'll be doing your funeral one way or the other we can be happy about what God's give us to get out of here bypassing death or we can just say well I'm old I Just Gotta Die well say that if you want to let's sing a song [Music] [Applause] beautiful Lord I do remember me [Music] outside the Sun [Music] 's

given us provision to make it you see all these uh you know sometimes you watch these survival shows well mankind tries to pick up this and make us you know take a stick make a bowl with it and and try to survive and that's not what God did he gave us the best to survive with he might want us to survive but he gave us a good tent to get in he gave us a good bible to read he gave us some good tapes to listen to and some good brothers and sisters to fellowship with I think the survival rate just went up hey man think of it that way don't think I'm just going to survive and just know the survival rate just went up every time you you get a little something extra from God the survival rate just keeps going up keeps going up I hope I didn't make anybody mad sister Trudy uh she's she would not ever think that I was trying to pick on her but she's an example she's an example that a lot of us are not and you know what examples do examples examples make me want more makes me strive more to that if if if she can do it I can do it if a lady single lady by herself can drive four hours to listen to uh you know maybe four hours of preaching three and a half hours of preaching back then and then turn around and go back home it wasn't like a whole day thing I mean turn around go back on God honored that you know why she didn't do it because well I'm going to do this because I want to I want to impress brother down that's not why she did that she did it because she wanted to hear from the word of God she wanted to hear and Faith cometh by what hearing and hearing by the word of God God put examples of people in all of our lives every one of us to either learn the good or the bad all right well she's been wanting to show the good and to condemn us that that that are a little slack sometimes she never was Slack and you know why because she had a desire in her heart to do better do we have a desire to do better I have a desire to be a better Christian if that's not inside of you you need to hit this altar as fast as you can in fact desire that deep call is Lord I want more of you not more of this and more of the world or more more money or more cars or more I want more of God you know what God's got to do what he said there's one thing about God he's not slack the Bible says according to his promises in other words we might be a little slack I may tell Deanna back there look Deanna I'll be at your house tomorrow afternoon at four o'clock to pick you up because I want you to come spend the night with us [Music] that really wasn't an example I was trying to make something you know kind of slide something in there but but now tomorrow at three o'clock something could happen and I need to do something else so I have to break that promise but there's never a promise come out of God's mouth that he was not able to keep and he will keep it so that's the God we got to depend on let's bow our hairs dear Lord thank you for this evening this time Lord I know the times changed and we were a lot of that sticking in the back of our head that we've lost an hour but Lord I we're Eternal people we should be thinking Lord Eternal thoughts but
