talking about okay all right I hope I got you I hope um Joe cut some of this off but uh let's turn to Revelation 6 now we're talking on this first seal last Sunday we were heading toward something and I kind of want to finish it up because the second seal is going to open in the same form listen in the same form but a different scene same form it's going to open the what do they say right here when the lamb open one the seals I heard the noise of Thunder one of the four Beast now this is going to be important when we get to number four and five and six seven I'll one of the four beasts which we know according to the prophet's message was the lion l i o n the lion remember you got lion ox man and Eagle all right so that was the first church age and the lion in that church age went out roaring the message of the hour the pure message that Jesus preached for the three and A2 years he was there on Earth the apostles took the part that they could understand cuz remember there's a mystery that they did not understand they didn't understand the complete mystery of the son of man when we get to the seventh seal we we have we are going to have to see the full revelation of the son of man not the Son of God the Son of God remember we we spoke on that we as we as this church believe one thing for sure that God has dispensation God is a dispensationalist there was a time when he told Peter he said I'll build my church on the Son of God Thou Art the Son of God Son of the Living God and Jesus said upon that rock or that Revelation I'll build my church so he built a revelation that Christ the son of God come from God went to God come back down on the day of Pentecost in a form called the Holy Ghost into the Believers right right in in the soul but now you got to see down through time though that there was you take Martin Luther when you come out of the Dark Ages he was smoking the pipe and drinking the beer and we was German we say you think well he was a drunk no listen Germans if you ever been to Germany I've never been but I've got friends that's been to Germany they drink beer like we drank water and Coke and tea okay so it's just a it's something that you don't sit down and go well I want to beer and Martin Luther got drunk we don't make that assumption at all it's just that he didn't see anything wrong with it in the age that he was living in everybody got that all right we don't do that because we know that there's something motivating that and it will take you to something further just like brother brand was talking about television and it's a little it's a little comical that brother Rand watched television and remember during his time they showed no bedroom scen they showed nothing nothing sexual as as of much but what did he see when they went into the bedroom there was um you had Aussie and Harriet which you had Lucy and Ricky in full pajamas sleeping in separate beds well that tell me that's harmless but when a prophet sees it he sees the end result he knew that what was going to happen is once they open that up yeah that the devil's going to come in and say well it's all right to get in the bedroom now so they go and they have the um you know as the stomach turns and all that stuff I mean has a world term and all that other stuff yeah you never heard a call that are in another world and all that other stuff you know all that and then the garbage that we've come up to now that's what innocent television has took us to and brother knew that he knew it would be the little things that would develop into big things so let's cut it off you know right so now we're going to read the first seal comment just a few minutes we're going to read the second seal and then drop back a little bit and I saw when lamb open one of the seals and I heard it was the noise of Thunder one of the four Beast saying come and see right and I saw him beheld a white horse and he that s on him had a bow and a crown was given unto him he went forth conquering and to conquer now this is developing and actually when the crown was given to him is is when is you're going into the next seal cuz remember the first doctrine that went out was a saying right a saying in other words a spirit like the prophet of God said if you read in the seal book he said you cannot Crown Spirit okay Crown has to go on a physical person right so he comes out though he had a bow but no arrows he was a bluff then a crown was given unto him in the latter stages of his ride because you're going to go from sayings to a deed yes Doctrine full manifestation right devil remember he he works in four stages the uh caterpillar Palmer worm caterpillar Locust and all the other I can't remember for but remember then God has to have four to bring it back brother Brown says you know he talks about three and we know it's justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost but then he talks about the word see in this end time it has to be the word fulfillment in a man that's why I said the Son of God Revelation is justification sanctification baptism the Holy Ghost you get the Holy Ghost you're a son and daughter of God you have the Son of God living in your soul right but he wants us but remember he there's a revelation of a son of man yes which is God in human flesh that's right I was listening to last Sundays and you get a little bit of a backlash when you say we got to be incarnate god well I didn't say that he did right okay so go argue with God and go argue with the prophet all right if a son of man's going to be fully revealed and God's going to be so visible Among Us well now he's not going to be visible in a person one person he's going to be visible in his bride so we must be God incarnate because Jesus was God incarnate right he took a body chain no one else has took a body chain in that form you hear what I'm saying in that form except the Bride of Jesus Christ which must be the son of man in the end time which is what God made flesh so it it it sometimes it is hard for people to say well we can't be well I'm just telling you what God said if you can't be that's your business that's your free moral agency but he knows there somebody going to take this full word take it in their heart and not just be Soul the Son of God in your soul but it's going to be the son of man it's going to be Jesus Christ standing on the Earth again just like he was 2,000 years ago only in a many membered body he has imorph from that one son of man mhm to the Bible says many sons that's right right Paul is talking about many sons coming so that's you and I that's us and and obviously it's real obvious that we're the only ones that can take a body chain cu the the the ones that's passed on and deceased cannot that's right without us bringing them now I know that when they come up they're going to get a body chain but we we as the bride have going to have to have enough word to where we stand like Jesus told Lazarus come forth but not be so limited even the prophet of God said there stood you know Jesus Christ in at the tomb of Lazarus and said if he would have called everybody's name they'd all come forth what a power what a power but he said Lazarus come forth so that called Lazarus name and I believe you and I will call all the dead saints name not Luther and Wesley and all the ones cuz we don't know those people right Luther had probably say he had a million converts I don't know one of them name personally but the word does cuz that's where they got their birth from so if we become the word Jesus was a word made flesh he knew all of his children I believe he knew who they were right okay what a father that wouldn't know who his kids are right okay and know where they are that's right okay so let's continue on so now and a crown was given unto him so now he comes and he's Crown whatever this Doctrine is who crowns him we do God doesn't crown him we do now I say we the denom I don't say denominational world let's just say that the the uh world that has cabbaged down on certain doctrines they crown him and give him his power okay um sitting in the temple of God showing himself to be as God he doesn't just brother K he's not just able to just go do that he has to be allowed to do it and as he is allowed to do it it's allowed through me and you that's true and I say me and you in our spirit realm and our flesh realm not in our soul that's why if you're born again you're in rapturing condition your soul as Eternal as God is you're going to take a a Rapture you're going to take a body change you're going to take a Rapture but somebody's got to stand here and and and be the we which are alive and remain and I don't believe that's I believe it's physically alive but I believe it's alive in Christ you got to be alive in Christ cuz they're dead in Christ okay yes you got to read that you got to read it and you got to read you read the Bible in different levels that's true you got to read it in different levels cuz you can you can look at this and you can read it in one level and say well that's like brother Brown did that white horse is looks like a white righteous church and he had a bow and he went conquering and he had a crown man that looks like Jesus no it's not the Antichrist but remember the in between in between the lines we have to see okay one true and living God and we have to see this person destroyed yes right here that he's the devil we got to see him destroyed in that level to move up to the next level you understand what I'm talk if you don't I'm going to explain it to you in just a second because what's got to happen look behind me I added something brother R said the seventh SE this is coming right now we know that that's going to culminate in a physical coming right but he's got to come in the bride first before the physical coming so what is this seventh seal is his coming on Earth in a bride I'm sorry in Bride form okay cuz remember we're not Eve was literally Adam in another body that's right and that was Adam's Body that she was in hello yeah that's right can say Jun and I can say she's bone my bone flesh and my flesh all you want to not in the physical form but Adam could literally look at Eve and say that come from me that's my body yes made manifest in another form that's what we got to see we see a separation God just saw an expanding or more of him to be revealed okay even messed up she should have been the bride The Perfect Bride right but God to have that kind of bride you're going to have to have a perfect bride same way with this that's what I'm saying this is a carbon copy this is a negative picture of a positive that's already there okay everybody got that one more time this is a negative picture cuz this is the Antichrist and what he's doing so you must have Jesus Christ on the scene doing his work before any of this can come to pass and it only comes to pass in our free moral agency is what we let him do and what we let him not do right correct and I saw and behold a white horse and he s him had a bow and the crown was given unto him went forth conquering and to conquer and then remember last Sunday I'm going to read it we're going to read that quote again a that beautiful little baby right there we're going to read the quote that we we read that white horse has been in the land all the time this is the second seal he didn't just develop no he was made known when the seals open been riding the whole time when Michael and and Satan fought in heaven that's when Satan came down and started riding cuz remember he has no power in heaven anymore he had power he had power remember but he took a third or whatever you want want to say of the Angel and he brought them down here brother said they came here to influence you and me cuz look Satan's not an idiot right he knows that God is using human beings to get his work done that's right why do you think Satan went right to the human race to get his work done but since he couldn't create he had to take from the animal race one that could compare with the human race and inject itself into of the human race to cause us to have a carnal mind the carnal mind is enmity and then you take Genesis 3:15 he said I'll put enity Satan didn't put enity between God and man God put enity between God and man a division like I told you last Sunday before I believe that Adam spoke to God just like me and Lis are talking to each other and then when that happened God had to withdraw himself he could why they were Sinners right even though Adam was a Son of God he had sin in his life that he now couldn't get rid of because remember he's the one that committed iniquity not Eve he thought she was doing right Adam knew what he was doing that's right I've always said Adam had a had a hard time after the fall yeah it's like having superpowers and then having superpowers taken away from you yeah you know he used to could move the trees and stop the wind and all that stuff well I believe when all that happened when they were driven out of the garden of Eden that a lot of that was taken away from him now I don't believe he lost the mind of God cuz he had he had the Holy Ghost Inside of him he had the teacher why do you think Hey listen there was Adam and Eve the Beast was gone so you had Adam and Eve and Cain and Abel and Seth and then Cain killed Abel so he only had Cain and Seth and then all the other there was nobody else there who was their Doctor Who was the one that was a mediator who was the one that that developed using and building and all that stuff it was all the different ones that come from Adam and I believe Adam was the teacher cuz you see God didn't just withdraw himself and leave and go off and say well go fend for yourself like Daddy's always said no no Daddy not told you that God never left him it's just that he couldn't have a personal relationship like he used to why do you think he's longing to get back to us cuz he lost that Fellowship you said no that can't listen the blood of bulls and goats could only cover sin it couldn't eradicate sin so God could come down into a human flesh and talk to um Abraham but he had to go back that's right he' come down and let Moses see the back part of a man but he had to go back he couldn't he couldn't reside with man the way he wants to now right but as he came in human flesh he came through a flesh that he created to me the Plan of Redemption is so simple so simple if we fail in human flesh God's got to come down in human flesh to redeem that got to and then what does he do he takes that human flesh puts it at Calvary kills it puts it in a grave this is our this is our sacrifice this part of Jesus was our sacrifice but his soul he took to hell for a ransom all right to me that's very simple and then that soul that paid the ransom came back on the day of P cost and ran them 120 yes then 3,000 then Millions okay but the body has yet to be redeemed that's right why because we've not had enough word this has all been so sealed up till we've had what we've had well when brother rown was alive there was 969 different denominations now there's 13,000 and some OD different denomination 13,000 different ideas on one man that's right that's not including Buddha and Muhammad and and like brother um prash said there millions of gods and goddesses in India that ain't even got nothing to do with God right so what a mess we've got ourself into in just 2,000 years right 2,000 years we got oursel in a mess right but it's coming back that what that was the prophet of God's message was to bring it and restore it right back to the Garden of Eden that's right right his message takes us right Back to the Future home which is the Garden of Eden condition that Adam and Eve were in before the fall amen so that's what we're heading back to but we got to see these White Horse this White Horse then we got to see the red and the black and the pale we must see these to identify what they are all right we've got to identify them now we identified the first one is a saying some little something you know somebody come in and preach a little something and and it don't get correct and that's kind of what happened down in these ages the apostles we we were talking about sthus sthus had this idea idea that Jesus wasn't God cuz remember you got to remember the first three ages they had no written documentation they had no Bible they had no Bible the Bible was written during this time but it never was printed until the time of the man Lon ox man an eagle man the man age the Bible's only been in print since what 1500 wasn't it like 1500 so it's only been what 600 years maybe that that we've had a printed Bible so it had to be that these Brethren were so strong in the faith they're preaching you had to listen you couldn't stay out of church and go back and listen to their tap sit with your slippers on it listen to the T but we can now yes but so they had to depend on what they heard you know what I'm saying so then somebody like sthus Satan can get on his horse ride into a man that just had a thought now listen it's just a thought but serenus starts bringing that thought and developing it right and then he starts what said it's got to be a thought first remember God does the same thing got to be a thought then a thought is what when it's spoken it's a thought expressed right so Satan throws that little thought how many thoughts has he throw in your brain in the past few days but you have something to fight it with corinthus didn't have anything to fight it with that we know of he couldn't have been he couldn't have been a holy ghost filled man but what he was he was spiritual he was religious right but irenius the prophet of the AG the one that had the holy ghost caught what he was saying and said get away from that it's worthless get away from it right that's what these seals do these seals show you to me they show Christ already here doing a work in somebody it ain't going to be a whole bunch this is where the whole bunch is going to be is is get caught up in this right the whole bunch is you know 99% of the people in the world is going to get caught up in these doctrines look at your me look at the message people they're getting caught up in these doctrines right and left or leaving the message now who is that is that God no that's that white horse rider that's now manifesting himself as a as a saying but what they do as as that developed in sthus it became a Doctrine yes something he practiced which is a deed it became a deed he practiced it I'm sure he probably asked different commentary oh that sounds good you know he no sthus on the back you that's what the devil does he gets three or four people together get them Pat them on their back and uh gets feeling good W I felt that you know I feel that it must be right no you either just got cold or the devil blowed on your neck one of the two that's about crazy Jesus didn't never have to have an emotion to prove who he was right he never needed an emotion to prove who he was you never saw Jesus dancing the only time I believe he ever run was in the temple when he was beating them people out with r the only time he ever run is when he was running people out of the temple right all right so and I believe in all that but I don't believe you got to I believe you don't build and base your experience on that right okay because look this white horse rider is still here right he's riding in a white righteous church but now to you and I here's my point to you and I we must see and then we'll I'm going to read the second seal and we'll drop back we have to see all these changes first he's a devil to begin with the spirit of the devil then he become the false prophet went into the started preaching his Doctrine through um and that just happen doesn't have to be one false prophet right okay because what happened was if it if it was just one pope then he couldn't get anybody else to see it but that false prophet got in a lot of people got in a bunch of people that's what I've always said if you can get a bunch of people to agree with you you got to think you're right exactly right ain't that right but when you got one thought and 50 people say no that ain't it it makes you wonder a little bit but when you bring it right back to the word like with the Daniel 7 we you know we kind of stand alone on that and all the other preachers kind of stand against it but hey I really don't care because I can prove it in the Bible and prove it by the prophet's message all right so I don't have to worry about it there you can stand as one Jesus stood by himself he stood alone right so we're going to stand alone in the end time we're not going to be real popular that's I promise you that that's okay became a false prophet teacher of a false Doctrine see if a false doct just goes out among people in the spirit it really it's looking for something to land on is what it's looking for to take root in sorry to take root in yes that's right and that's what this ISS cuz when it goes in and people starts breaking it down and teaching it see then it becomes a Doctrine that's right and that person becomes that Doctrine and then you become that Doctrine if you accept it that's why you have to watch false teaching because it's seed planting plant a little seed here a little seed here well if you let that seed grow and don't pluck it up like Jesus said you got to pluck it up by the roots and throw it away you can't just trim it right that's what we do in the message a lot of times we trim what brother Bram says you know we trim what the Bible says and we keep that same old root well you you throw that thing out that's right and I believe that's what this is this this seal this seals to me is a final cleaning out of your whole body spirit and soul body spirit and soul your Soul's clean that's right but your body is nothing really that's right so it's your spirit that where all these reside right you don't have faith in your body no right cuz your body is really contrary to any kind of Faith that's right you don't have virtue knowledge look all these all these have to work out through your in your uh spirit realm I've always said that's our biggest trouble it's not our body right not our soul if you're born again that's right it's in that Spirit realm that's right amen cuz Satan's got his five fingers coming down through it and God's got his five fingers coming up out of the St and they meet and that's the greatest battle ever fought my brother preach the greatest battle ever fought it was not in your brain brain matter brain it's in your brain but it's not your brain that's cuz your brain's nothing but what goes this way and this way what you let in like we were talking the other day when brother Brandon would he knew that epileptic devil would go through your eyes cuz remember the eyes is the Gateway in the soul he told them he said close your eyes and bow your head and God forbid if you open your eyes cuz when this demon leaves he's going to find a place to go where's the first place when you look up this is the gateway to the soul I wish I could get rid of the things I see yeah or saw right I don't know if y'all that way but I am I wished I could get R I asked God the other day I said God please erase that from my brain but at the moment he can't because that's the part of the sin curse that that stays in there cuz I saw it with my natural eyeballs you understand what I'm saying but still through those same set of eyeballs and through that same brain God's got to work that's right what I see but remember what you see physically see can be false yes it can be twisted but what you see in in your soul what you understand from the heart Satan can't take that away from you because what's inside of you that teacher which is doing what is casting out all these things on a daily basis it should be casting out the thing you see why this first seal is so important to me the first seal is the most important seal cuz if you don't see one true and living God and that God is either working in your life or not and for those of you that don't have the Holy Ghost he's not working as he should amen you need to let him in so he can work that's right all right ask him to ask him to come in and do and see we try to fight her own battle that's the problem we try to figure things out let him come in he's the teacher yes but this guy's still riding he gets off of one horse well that power that horse continues to ride he's still here now now I mean you can't get you can't get to people that are in the denomination the world you can't get them to see that they're wrong everything's okay to them you know so Satan has so ingrained that into them till they're just brother Brown said they're false people in a false system that's right okay but they can be anointed by the true Holy Ghost that's right thinking that it's in their soul but it's just on their Spirit see where that Spirit realm is so tricky that's right boy I mean real tricky memory reason oh boy conscious affection and Imagination boy you can just imagine that yeah yeah pretty rough isn't it but when we see this seal come down we see one true and living God and we see that there's a separation like we said last week there was twins come down and every in every work of God that was twins God came on the earth Satan right came on the Earth right God come down with signs and wonders in the end time through brother Ram the prophet of God in the first part of his ministry Satan comes right down with impersonating right right that's what brother was talking about the three pulls cuz cuz what did what did the angel tell him first pull can be imitated right all right second pull can be imitated third pole can't be imitated why can a third pole not be imitated third pole is the revealing of the word of God Satan cannot get a revelation of the word of God if he did he'd know that he was false and he could be saved that's right that's right cuz that's what our we did right we opened the word of God we found out we were lost and God could save us we laugh but and we shouldn't but still it's so everything we think is the devil so way out you under you know he's in the bars and the prostitutes and the this no he never wanted to be there but because of what he done he's a destroyer everything he touches turns against God so everything he tries to do turns against God but he's coming he's right here riding trying to get this church he knows I'm not saying just lul church this church Church of the Living God he's trying to get her to go in his Direction and he knows if he can do that then he can defeat God he cannot defeat God Head to Head that's right but he thinks if he gets enough you know if he gets you think if he was standing there with Goliath that day he' know that there was you know he ain't got he ain't got a leg to stand on but anyway but he's a deceiver so I believe he's deceived and being in deception he's deceived and he's also deceiving other people deceiving and he deceives us yes mhm how many times you thought you right and you wrong how many times you don't have to raise your hand cuz I know you all will but let's look at this real quick then we'll read the second seal the first seal was you see all these symbols but now what's got to happen now let me make two points number one is the seal has an opening and it has an ending because Satan gets off of this horse and he goes over and he completely gets on something not different as far as we say totally different it's just a little more deceptive okay red horse oh I know it was the blood I know see so Satan gets over and he gets in the same thing see what I'm talking about but the first seal doesn't end as far as being destroyed except in one group of people right we've got to see that first seal destroyed in Me and You by what by he's coming the only way that this can be destroyed is he comes in you gives you a revelation of that seal and that white horse rider has to leave the scene but Satan's not done he brings another one see this white horse rider rides all the way to the end right right but not in me and you if we get a revelation it ends at the revelation of Jesus Christ I think that's what the Bible says at the revelation of Jesus Christ all these things what his coming is the revealing it's revealing what's going on right right so as the first seal ends to the believer to the True Believer the true one with the Holy Ghost that believes and and takes it in and studies it his coming ends that first seal but now if you're not sealed in if you're not born again and receiving the message of the the hour he just continues to ride right on okay everybody got that yes so you got to see his coming not his physical coming because remember the coming of the Lord is revealing of his word what's the third pull revealing of his word everything at the culmination of this is the revealing of the word amen that's right right all right that's where you get you four because see brother Brown's going to as he goes through this he's going to notice that there's four horse riders right right now he does doesn't have that Revelation yet I'll prove it to you later but he says first stage devil Spirit false prophet next the very Devil Himself he's got three if you watch later on he develops and brings in four because if you got four horse riders you got to bring in four things to combat that okay so you see he developed and and like I said before even on the second seal he said totally contrary to what I was thinking he was looking it over again it wasn't just the first seal every day he came up with something that was different than what he had had saw before all right that's why he knew he was working in a realm then that was exact Perfection perfect work was being was being made known right there not that it wasn't before but there was some flaws in it just like the first seal thinking that the white horse rider was the Holy Ghost well that's what Satan wants he wants to be revealed as the Holy Ghost God had to reveal it back to the prophet and walk in that room and say no no no that that's not me that's the Antichrist and oh my see then then then scripture started to opening up to brother brown maybe that he hadn't seen before that's why he worked in the realm but what happened was he came on the scene at the end of that seal and revealed himself to brother Brown so that he could preach this to me and you so that God could come and do the same thing okay so at the end of every there is a coming of the Lord to you to reveal to you something more about God same thing you got the Devil he's going to still be there okay but he's going to he's so deceptive he's going to turn and get off of that horse and he's going to get on another one all right so let's read that Revelation 6 verse two when he had opened the second seal I heard the second beast say come and see now who's the second beast Ox see your first Beast was in the first three ages lion ox man and at the end the eagle have I got that you should know that it's just simple teaching that's been taught for years and years and years first three Church ages the lion the lion of the tribe of Judah roaring out out the message of the hour in these first three ages not a lot of false Doctrine but when you come to the end of this church age right here going into that the Dark Ages this is when the Catholics ruled right right that was the O labor all they had to do was say I believe in Jesus Christ and they were killed but they you know what they didn't care they labored right on through that all right Lon ox man what intelligence pre press look at it now see there the the world's in an eagle age too I I've always said I said you you know I told you last Sunday that U we've had Wireless communication for a long time God communicated wirelessly to people for a long time he's never had to be connected right to a phone line or any kind of line he's but I was thinking this morning I thought well you know the the animals have been connected to GPS forever how can a duck fly to Canada in the spring have her babies them babies hatch grow to about three or four five months old turn around and never been to Georgia or Louisiana except in their mother how are they going to know to fly straight right down to the same ground salmon go back to the same spawning ground every year how they know that God's positioning system that's right Google Google is old hat to God yeah that's right and how does he Lead You by a wire no no he leads you by an in dwelling but what we hear from God Amen okay so let's don't you know Wireless communication's been here for a long time all right now look we're going to read this right here real quick I'm going to make one coming and we'll go and when he had open the second SE I heard the second beast say come and see and there went out another horse so it's another Power another horse he didn't say that horse change color that's another horse that white horse rider that white righteous church is still riding still riding today and it's making people believe the lie of the devil father son Holy Ghost all the baptism see and and there went out another horse that was red brother R said in the seal book he gets off one and gets on another he doesn't just keep riding and that one turns from white to red right that one got to keep going cuz this already got power people are giving it the power and there went out another horse that was red and power was given same thing power was given to him that sat their own to take peace from the earth and they should kill one another and there was given unto him a great sword everybody got that yes now you got to remember this seal is going to open but it's going to open because now it's going to open to us I'm talking about us because he came on the scene and he showed you the first cuz remember the seals are just like the statue of perfect man not not the same Faith virtue all but you still you have to build one upon the other got it that's right it's got to build one on top of the other all right the people that were influenced under the white hor they're the ones that come under the influence of the that's correct that's correct that's correct as Satan goes higher but remember God's got to go higher and the blood of Jesus Christ is what we need to talk about first then we'll talk about this guy this fell that turns everything red cuz it is physical blood right here 68 million Christians were killed during the Dark Ages what blood killed they were physically killed and brother R we'll read it next Sunday brother R says no telling how many spiritually dead that was 68 million that they kill physically but no and think about now what people are spiritually dead right thinking they're taking the blood of Jesus Christ okay let's go got to go got watch our time
